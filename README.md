# Chironata
Chironata is a large, multilingual dataset, aligned at the sentence level.

## Chiron
This dataset was built using a pipeline, [Chiron](https://github.com/caro28/chiron/), which consists of an embedding model (LaBSE) and a sentence alignment model (Vecalign).

Chiron is adapted here to run at scale, on directories of source and target documents.

## Pipeline: runner.py
