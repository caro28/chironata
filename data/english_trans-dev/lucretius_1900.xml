          <p>Mother of the Aeneadae, darling of men and gods, increase- <lb/>
            giving Venus, who beneath the gliding signs of heaven fillest with <lb/>
            thy presence the ship-carrying sea, the corn-bearing lands, since <lb/>
            through thee every kind of living things is conceived, rises up <lb/>
            and beholds the light of the sun. Before thee, goddess, flee the <lb/>
            winds, the clouds of heaven; before thee and thy advent; for <lb/>
            thee earth manifold in works puts forth sweet-smelling flowers; <lb/>
            for thee the levels of the sea do laugh and heaven propitiated <lb/>
            shines with outspread light. For soon as the vernal aspect of <lb/>
            day is disclosed, and the birth-favouring breeze of favonius un­ <lb/>
            barred is blowing fresh, first the fowls of the air, o lady, shew <lb/>
            signs of thee and thy entering in, throughly smitten in heart by <lb/>
            thy power. Next the wild herds bound over the glad pastures <lb/>
            and swim the rapid rivers: in such wise each made prisoner by <lb/>
            thy charms follows thee with desire, whither thou goest to lead <lb/>
            it on. Yes, throughout seas and mountains and sweeping rivers <lb/>
            and leafy homes of birds and grassy plains, striking fond love into <lb/>
            the breasts of all thou constrainest them each after its kind to <lb/>
            continue their races with desire. Since thou then art sole mis­ <lb/>
            tress of the nature of things and without thee nothing rises up <lb/>
            into the divine borders of light, nothing grows to be glad or <lb/>
            lovely, fain would I have thee for a helpmate in writing the verses <lb/>
            which I essay to pen on the nature of things for our own son of <lb/>
            the Memmii, whom thou, goddess, hast willed to have no peer, <lb/>
            rich as he ever is in every grace. Wherefore all the more, o lady, <lb/>
            lend my lays an everliving charm. Cause .meanwhile the savage <note type="footnote"> M. III. </note> <note type="footnote"> A </note> <lb/>
            <pb n="2"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="29−76"/><lb/>
            works of war to be lulled to rest throughout all seas and lands; <lb/>
            for thou alone canst bless mankind with calm peace, seeing that <lb/>
            Mavors lord of battle controls the savage works of war, Mavors <lb/>
            who often flings himself into thy lap quite vanquished by the <lb/>
            never-healing wound of love; and then with upturned face and <lb/>
            shapely neck thrown back feeds with love his greedy sight gazing, <lb/>
            goddess, open-mouthed on thee; and as backward he reclines, his <lb/>
            breath stays hanging on thy lips. While then, lady, he is reposing <lb/>
            on thy holy body, shed thyself about him and above, and pour <lb/>
            from thy lips sweet discourse, asking, glorious dame, gentle peace <lb/>
            for the Romans. For neither can we in our country's day of <lb/>
            trouble with untroubled mind think only of our work, nor can the <lb/>
            illustrious offset of Memmius in times like these be wanting to the <lb/>
            general weal. <lb/>
            for what remains to tell, apply to true reason unbusied ears and a <lb/>
            keen mind withdrawn from cares, lest my gifts set out for you <lb/>
            with stedfast zeal you abandon with disdain, before they are <lb/>
            understood. For I will essay to discourse to you of the most <lb/>
            high system of heaven and the gods and will open up the first- <lb/>
            beginnings of things, out of which nature gives birth to all things <lb/>
            and increase and nourishment, and into which nature likewise <lb/>
            dissolves them back after their destruction. These we are accus­ <lb/>
            tomed in explaining their reason to call matter and begetting <lb/>
            bodies of things and to name seeds of things and also to term first <lb/>
            bodies, because from them as first elements all things are.</p>
          <p>When human life to view lay foully prostrate upon earth <lb/>
            crushed down under the weight of religion, who shewed her head <lb/>
            from the quarters of heaven with hideous aspect lowering upon <lb/>
            mortals, a man of Greece ventured first to lift up his mortal eyes <lb/>
            to her face and first to withstand her to her face. Him neither <lb/>
            story of gods nor thunderbolts nor heaven with threatening roar <lb/>
            could quell: they only chafed the more the eager courage of his <lb/>
            soul, filling him with desire to be the first to burst the fast bars <lb/>
            of nature's portals. Therefore the living force of his soul gained <lb/>
            the day: on he passed far beyond the flaming walls of the world <lb/>
            and traversed throughout in mind and spirit the immeasurable <lb/>
            universe; whence he returns a conqueror to tell us what can, what <lb/>
            cannot come into being; in short on what principle each thing <pb n="3"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="76−120"/> <lb/>
            has its powers defined, its deep-set boundary mark. Therefore <lb/>
            religion is put under foot and trampled upon in turn; us his <lb/>
            victory brings level with heaven.</p>
          <p>This is what I fear herein, lest haply you should fancy that <lb/>
            you are entering on unholy grounds of reason and treading the <lb/>
            path of sin; whereas on the contrary often and often that very <lb/>
            religion has given birth to sinful and unholy deeds. Thus in <lb/>
            Aulis the chosen chieftains of the Danai, foremost of men, foully <lb/>
            polluted with Iphianassa's blood the altar of the Trivian maid. <lb/>
            Soon as the fillet encircling her maiden tresses shed itself in equal <lb/>
            lengths adown each cheek, and soon as she saw her father standing <lb/>
            sorrowful before the altars and beside him the ministering priests <lb/>
            hiding the knife and her countrymen at sight of her shedding <lb/>
            tears, speechless in terror she dropped down on her knees and <lb/>
            sank to the ground. Nor aught in such a moment could it avail <lb/>
            the luckless girl that she had first bestowed the name of father on <lb/>
            the king. For lifted up in the hands of the men she was carried <lb/>
            shivering to the altars, not after due performance of the customary <lb/>
            rites to be escorted by the clear-ringing bridal song, but in the <lb/>
            very season of marriage, stainless maid mid the stain of blood, to <lb/>
            fall a sad victim by the sacrificing stroke of a father, that thus a <lb/>
            happy and prosperous departure might be granted to the fleet. <lb/>
            So great the evils to which religion could prompt!</p>
          <p>You yourself some time or other overcome by the terror-speak­ <lb/>
            ing tales of the seers will seek to fall away from us. Ay indeed <lb/>
            for how many dreams may they now imagine for you, enough to <lb/>
            upset the calculations of life and trouble all your fortunes with <lb/>
            fear! And with good cause; for if men saw that there was a <lb/>
            fixed limit to their woes, they would be able in some way to with­ <lb/>
            stand the religious scruples and threatenings of the seers. As it <lb/>
            is, there is no way, no means of resisting, since they must fear <lb/>
            after death everlasting pains. For they cannot tell what is the <lb/>
            nature of the soul, whether it be born or on the contrary find its <lb/>
            way into men at their birth, and whether it perish together with <lb/>
            us when severed from us by death or visit the gloom of Orcus and <lb/>
            wasteful pools or by divine decree find its way into brutes in our <lb/>
            stead, as sang our Ennius who first brought down from delightful <lb/>
            Helicon a crown of unfading leaf, destined to bright renown <lb/>
            throughout Italian clans of men. And yet with all this Ennius <note type="footnote"> A 2 </note> <lb/>
            <pb n="4"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="120−162"/><lb/>
            sets forth that there are Acherusian quarters, publishing it in <lb/>
            immortal verses; though in our passage thither neither our souls <lb/>
            nor bodies hold together, but only certain idols pale in wondrous <lb/>
            wise. From these places he tells us the ghost of everliving Homer <lb/>
            uprose before him and began to shed salt tears and to unfold in <lb/>
            words the nature of things. Wherefore we must well grasp the <lb/>
            principle of things above, the principle by which the courses of the <lb/>
            sun and moon go on, the force by which every thing on earth pro­ <lb/>
            ceeds, but above all we must find out by keen reason what the <lb/>
            soul and the nature of the mind consist of, and what thing it is <lb/>
            which meets us when awake and frightens our minds, if we are <lb/>
            under the influence of disease; meets and frightens us too when <lb/>
            we are buried in sleep ; so that we seem to see and hear speaking <lb/>
            to us face to face them who are dead, whose bones earth holds in <lb/>
            its embrace. Nor does my mind fail to perceive how hard it is to <lb/>
            make clear in Latin verses the dark discoveries of the Greeks, <lb/>
            especially as many points must be dealt with in new terms on <lb/>
            account of the poverty of the language and the novelty of the <lb/>
            questions. But yet your worth and the looked for pleasure of <lb/>
            sweet friendship prompt me to undergo any labour and lead me <lb/>
            on to watch the clear nights through, seeking by what words and <lb/>
            in what verse I may be able in the end to shed on your mind so <lb/>
            clear a light that you can thoroughly scan hidden things.</p>
          <p>This terror then and darkness of mind must be dispelled not <lb/>
            by the rays of the sun and glittering shafts of day, but by the <lb/>
            aspect and the law of nature; the warp of whose design we shall <lb/>
            begin with this first principle, nothing is ever gotten out of <lb/>
            nothing by divine power. Fear in sooth holds so in check all <lb/>
            mortals, because they see many operations go on in earth and <lb/>
            heaven, the causes of which they can in no way understand, <lb/>
            believing them therefore to be done by power divine. For these <lb/>
            reasons when we shall have seen that nothing can be produced <lb/>
            from nothing, we shall then more correctly ascertain that which <lb/>
            we are seeking, both the elements out of which every thing can be <lb/>
            produced and the manner in which all things arc done without the <lb/>
            hand of the gods.</p>
          <p>If things came from nothing, any kind might be born of any <lb/>
            thing, nothing would require seed. Men for instance might rise <lb/>
            out of the sea, the scaly race out of the earth, and birds might <pb n="5"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="162−206"/><lb/>
            burst out of the sky; horned and other herds, every kind of wild <lb/>
            beasts would haunt with changing brood tilth and wilderness alike. <lb/>
            Nor would the same fruits keep constant to trees, but would <lb/>
            change ; any tree might bear any fruit. For if there were not be­ <lb/>
            getting bodies for each, how could things have a fixed unvarying <lb/>
            mother ? But in fact because things are all produced from fixed <lb/>
            seeds, each thing is born and goes forth into the borders of light <lb/>
            out of that in which resides its matter and first bodies; and for <lb/>
            this reason all things cannot be gotten out of all things, because <lb/>
            in particular things resides a distinct power. Again why do we <lb/>
            see the rose put forth in spring, corn in the season of heat, vines <lb/>
            yielding at the call of autumn, if not because, when the fixed <lb/>
            seeds of things have streamed together at the proper time, what­ <lb/>
            ever is born discloses itself, while the due seasons are there-and <lb/>
            the quickened earth brings its weakly products in safety forth into <lb/>
            the borders of light ? But if they came from nothing, they would <lb/>
            rise up suddenly at uncertain periods and unsuitable times of year, <lb/>
            inasmuch as there would be no first-beginnings to be kept from a <lb/>
            begetting union by the unpropitious season. No nor would time <lb/>
            be required for the growth of things after the meeting of the seed, <lb/>
            if they could increase out of nothing. Little babies would at once <lb/>
            grow into men and trees in a moment would rise and spring out <lb/>
            of the ground. But none of these events it is plain ever comes to <lb/>
            pass, since all things grow step by step [at a fixed time], as is na­ <lb/>
            tural, [since they all grow] from a fixed seed and in growing pre­ <lb/>
            serve their kind; so that you may be sure that all things increase <lb/>
            in size and are fed out of their own matter. Furthermore without <lb/>
            fixed seasons of rain the earth is unable to put forth its gladdening <lb/>
            produce, nor again if kept from food could the nature of living <lb/>
            things continue its kind and sustain life; so that you may hold <lb/>
            with greater truth that many bodies are common to many things, <lb/>
            as we see letters common to different words, than that any thing <lb/>
            could come into being without first-beginnings. Again why could <lb/>
            not nature have produced men of such a size and strength as to be <lb/>
            able to wade on foot across the sea and rend great mountains with <lb/>
            their hands and outlive many generations of living men, if not <lb/>
            because an unchanging matter has been assigned for begetting <lb/>
            things and what can arise out of this matter is fixed ? We must <lb/>
            admit therefore that nothing can come from nothing, since things <pb n="6"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="206−247"/> <lb/>
            require seed before they can severally be born and be brought out <lb/>
            into the buxom fields of air. Lastly since we see that tilled <lb/>
            grounds surpass untilled and yield a better produce by the labour <lb/>
            of hands, we may infer that there are in the earth first-beginnings <lb/>
            of things which by turning up the fruitful clods with the share <lb/>
            and labouring the soil of the earth we stimulate to rise. But if <lb/>
            there were not such, you would see all things without any labour <lb/>
            of ours spontaneously come forth in much greater perfection.</p>
          <p>Moreover nature dissolves every thing back into its first bodies <lb/>
            and does not annihilate things. For if aught were mortal in all <lb/>
            its parts alike, the thing in a moment would be snatched away to <lb/>
            destruction from before our eyes; since no force would be needed <lb/>
            to produce disruption among its parts and undo their fastenings. <lb/>
            Whereas in fact, as all things consist of an imperishable seed, na­ <lb/>
            ture suffers the destruction of nothing to be seen, until a force has <lb/>
            encountered it sufficient to dash things to pieces by a blow or to <lb/>
            pierce through the void places within them and break them up. <lb/>
            Again if time, whenever it makes away with things through age, <lb/>
            utterly destroys them eating up all their matter, out of what does <lb/>
            Venus bring back into the light of life the race of living things <lb/>
            each after its kind, or, when they are brought back, out of what <lb/>
            does earth manifold in works give them nourishment and increase, <lb/>
            furnishing them with food each after its kind ? Out of what do <lb/>
            its own native fountains and extraneous rivers from far and wide <lb/>
            keep full the sea? Out of what does ether feed the stars? For <lb/>
            infinite time gone by and lapse of days must have eaten up all <lb/>
            things which are of mortal body. N ow if in that period of time <lb/>
            gone by those things have existed, of which this sum of things <lb/>
            is composed and recruited, they are possessed no doubt of an <lb/>
            imperishable body, and cannot therefore any of them return <lb/>
            to nothing. Again the same force and cause would destroy all <lb/>
            things without distinction, unless everlasting matter held them <lb/>
            together, matter more or less closely linked in mutual entangle­ <lb/>
            ment : a touch in sooth would be sufficient cause of death, inas­ <lb/>
            much as any amount of force must of course undo the texture <lb/>
            of things in which no parts at all were of an everlasting body. <lb/>
            But in fact, because the fastenings of first-beginnings one with <lb/>
            the other are unlike and matter is everlasting, things continue <lb/>
            with body uninjured, until a force is found to encounter them <pb n="7"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="247−288"/> <lb/>
            strong enough to overpower the texture of each. A thing there­ <lb/>
            fore never returns to nothing, but all things after disruption go <lb/>
            back into the first bodies of matter. Lastly rains die, when father <lb/>
            ether has tumbled them into the lap of mother earth; but then <lb/>
            goodly crops spring up and boughs are green with leaves upon the <lb/>
            trees, trees themselves grow and are laden with fruit; by them in <lb/>
            turn our race and the race of wild beasts are fed, by them we see <lb/>
            glad towns teem with children and the leafy forests ring on all <lb/>
            sides with the song of new birds; through them cattle wearied <lb/>
            with their load of fat lay their bodies down about the glad pas­ <lb/>
            tures and the white milky stream pours from the distended udders ; <lb/>
            through them a new brood with weakly limbs frisks and gambols <lb/>
            over the soft grass, rapt in their young hearts with the pure new <lb/>
            milk. None of the things therefore which seem to be lost is <lb/>
            utterly lost, since nature replenishes one thing out of another and <lb/>
            does not suffer any thing to be begotten, before she has been re­ <lb/>
            cruited by the death of some other.</p>
          <p>Now mark me: since I have taught that things cannot be <lb/>
            born from nothing, cannot when begotten be brought back to <lb/>
            nothing, that you may not haply yet begin in any shape to <lb/>
            mistrust my words, because the first-beginnings of things can­ <lb/>
            not be seen by the eyes, take moreover this list of bodies which <lb/>
            you must yourself admit are in the number of things and cannot <lb/>
            be seen. First of all the force of the wind when aroused beats <lb/>
            on the harbours and whelms huge ships and scatters clouds; <lb/>
            sometimes in swift whirling eddy it scours the plains and straws <lb/>
            them with large trees and scourges the mountain summits with <lb/>
            forest-rending blasts: so fiercely does the wind rave with a shrill <lb/>
            howling and rage with threatening roar. Winds therefore sure <lb/>
            enough are unseen bodies which sweep the seas, the lands, ay <lb/>
            and the clouds of heaven, tormenting them and catching them <lb/>
            up in sudden whirls. On they stream and spread destruction <lb/>
            abroad in just the same way as the soft liquid nature of water, <lb/>
            when all at once it is borne along in an overflowing stream, and <lb/>
            a great downfall of water from the high hills augments it with <lb/>
            copious rains, flinging together fragments of forests and entire <lb/>
            trees; nor can the strong bridges sustain the sudden force of <lb/>
            coming water: in such wise turbid with much rain the river <lb/>
            dashes upon the piers with mighty force: makes havoc with loud <pb n="8"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="288−333"/> <lb/>
            noise and rolls under its eddies huge stones: wherever aught <lb/>
            opposes its waves, down it dashes it. In this way then must the <lb/>
            blasts of wind as well move on, and when they like a mighty <lb/>
            stream have borne down in any direction, they push things be­ <lb/>
            fore them and throw them down with repeated assaults, some­ <lb/>
            times catch them up in curling eddy and carry them away in <lb/>
            swift-circling whirl. Wherefore once and again I say winds are <lb/>
            unseen bodies, since in their works and ways they are found to <lb/>
            rival great rivers which are of a visible body. Then again we per­ <lb/>
            ceive the different smells of things, yet never see them coming to <lb/>
            our nostrils; nor do we behold heats nor can we observe cold with <lb/>
            the eyes nor are we used to see voices. Yet all these things must <lb/>
            consist of a bodily nature, since they are able to move the senses; <lb/>
            for nothing but body can touch and be touched. Again clothes <lb/>
            hung up on a shore which waves break upon become moist, and <lb/>
            then get dry if spread out in the sun. Yet it has not been seen <lb/>
            in what way the moisture of water has sunk into them nor again <lb/>
            in what way this has been dispelled by heat. The moisture there­ <lb/>
            fore is dispersed into small particles which the eyes are quite unable <lb/>
            to see. Again after the revolution of many of the sun's years a ring <lb/>
            on the finger is thinned on the under side by wearing, the drip­ <lb/>
            ping from the eaves hollows a stone, the bent ploughshare of iron <lb/>
            imperceptibly decreases in the fields, and we behold the stone- <lb/>
            paved streets worn down by the feet of the multitude; the brass <lb/>
            statues too at the gates shew their right hands to be wasted by <lb/>
            the touch of the numerous passers by who greet them. These <lb/>
            things then we see are lessened, since they have been thus worn <lb/>
            down; but what bodies depart at any given time the nature of <lb/>
            vision has jealously shut out our seeing. Lastly the bodies which <lb/>
            time and nature add to things by little and little, constraining <lb/>
            them to grow in due measure, no exertion of the eyesight can <lb/>
            behold; and so too wherever things grow old by age and decay, <lb/>
            and when rocks hanging over the sea are eaten away by the <lb/>
            gnawing salt spray, you cannot see what they lose at any given <lb/>
            moment. Nature therefore works by unseen bodies.</p>
          <p>And yet all things are not on all sides jammed together and <lb/>
            kept in by body: there is also void in things. To have learned <lb/>
            this will be good for you on many accounts; it will not suffer <lb/>
            you to wander in doubt and be to seek in the sum of things and <pb n="9"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="333−378"/> <lb/>
            distrustful of our words. If there were not void, things could <lb/>
            not move at all; for that which is the property of body, to let <lb/>
            and hinder, would be present to all things at all times; nothing <lb/>
            therefore could go on, since no other thing would be the first <lb/>
            to give way. But in fact throughout seas and lands and the <lb/>
            heights of heaven we see before our eyes many things move in <lb/>
            many ways for various reasons, which things, if there were no <lb/>
            void, I need not say would lack and want restless motion: they <lb/>
            never would have been begotten at all, since matter jammed on <lb/>
            all sides would have been at rest. Again however solid things <lb/>
            are thought to be, you may yet learn from this that they are of <lb/>
            rare body: in rocks and caverns the moisture of water oozes <lb/>
            through and all things weep with abundant drops; food distri­ <lb/>
            butes itself through the whole body of living things; trees grow <lb/>
            and yield fruit in season, because food is diffused through the <lb/>
            whole from the very roots over the stem and all the boughs. <lb/>
            Voices pass through walls and fly through houses shut, stiffening <lb/>
            frost pierces to the bones. Now if there are no void parts, by <lb/>
            what way can the bodies severally pass ? You would see it to be <lb/>
            quite impossible. Once more, why do we see one thing surpass <lb/>
            another in weight though not larger in size ? For if there is just <lb/>
            as much body in a ball of wool as there is in a lump of lead, <lb/>
            it is natural it should weigh the same, since the property of body <lb/>
            is to weigh all things downwards, while on the contrary the nature <lb/>
            of void is ever without weight. Therefore when a thing is just <lb/>
            as large, yet is found to be lighter, it proves sure enough that it <lb/>
            has more of void in it; while on the other hand that which is <lb/>
            heavier shews that there is in it more of body and that it con­ <lb/>
            tains within it much less of void. Therefore that which we are <lb/>
            seeking with keen reason exists sure enough, mixed up in things; <lb/>
            and we call it void.</p>
          <p>And herein I am obliged to forestall this point which some <lb/>
            raise, lest it draw you away from the truth. The waters they <lb/>
            say make way for the scaly creatures as they press on, and open <lb/>
            liquid paths, because the fish leave room behind them, into which <lb/>
            the yielding waters may stream; thus other things too may move <lb/>
            and change place among themselves, although the whole sum be <lb/>
            full. This you are to know has been taken up on grounds wholly <lb/>
            false. For on what side I ask can the scaly creatures move for­ <pb n="10"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="379−423"/> <lb/>
            wards, unless the waters have first made room ? again on what <lb/>
            side can the waters give place, so long as the fish are unable to <lb/>
            go on ? Therefore you must either strip all bodies of motion <lb/>
            or admit that in things void is mixed up from which every thing <lb/>
            gets its first start in moving. Lastly if two broad bodies after <lb/>
            contact quickly spring asunder, the air must surely fill all the <lb/>
            void which is formed between the bodies. Well however rapidly <lb/>
            it stream together with swift-circling currents, yet the whole space <lb/>
            will not be able to be filled up in one moment; for it must occupy <lb/>
            first one spot and then another, until the whole is taken up. But <lb/>
            if haply any one supposes that, when the bodies have started <lb/>
            asunder, that result follows because the air condenses, he is mis­ <lb/>
            taken ; for a void is then formed which was not before, and a void <lb/>
            also is filled which existed before; nor can the air condense in <lb/>
            such a way, nor supposing it could, could it methinks without <lb/>
            void draw into itself and bring its parts together.</p>
          <p>Wherefore however long you hold out by urging many ob­ <lb/>
            jections, you must needs in the end admit that there is a void in <lb/>
            things. And many more arguments I may state to you in order <lb/>
            to accumulate proof on my words; but these slight footprints are <lb/>
            enough for a keen-searching mind to enable you by yourself to <lb/>
            find out all the rest. For as dogs often discover by smell the <lb/>
            lair of a mountain-ranging wild beast though covered over with <lb/>
            leaves, when once they have got on the sure tracks, thus you in <lb/>
            cases like this will be able by yourself alone to see one thing after <lb/>
            another and find your way into all dark corners and draw forth <lb/>
            the truth. But if you lag or swerve a jot from the reality, this <lb/>
            I can promise you, Memmius, without more ado: such plenteous <lb/>
            draughts from abundant wellsprings my sweet tongue shall pour <lb/>
            from my richly furnished breast, that I fear slow age will steal <lb/>
            over our limbs and break open in us the fastnesses of life, ere the <lb/>
            whole store of reasons on any one question has by my verses been <lb/>
            dropped into your ears.</p>
          <p>But now to resume the thread of the design which I am weav­ <lb/>
            ing in verse: all nature then, as it exists by itself, is founded on <lb/>
            two things: there are bodies and there is void in which these <lb/>
            bodies are. placed and through which they move about. For that <lb/>
            body exists by itself the general feeling of mankind declares; and <lb/>
            unless at the very first belief in this be firmly grounded, there <pb n="11"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="424−467"/> <lb/>
            will be nothing to which we can appeal on hidden things in order <lb/>
            to prove anything by reasoning of mind. Then again, if room and <lb/>
            space which we call void did not exist, bodies could not be placed <lb/>
            anywhere nor move about at all to any side; as we have demon­ <lb/>
            strated to you a little before. Moreover there is nothing which <lb/>
            you can affirm to be at once separate from all body and quite <lb/>
            distinct from void, which would so to say count as the discovery <lb/>
            of a third nature. For whatever shall exist, this of itself must <lb/>
            be something or other. Now if it shall admit of touch in however <lb/>
            slight and small a measure, it will, be it with a large or be it with <lb/>
            a little addition, provided it do exist, increase the amount of body <lb/>
            and join the sum. But if it shall be intangible and unable to <lb/>
            hinder any thing from passing through it on any side, this you <lb/>
            are to know will be that which we call empty void. Again what­ <lb/>
            ever shall exist by itself, will either do something or will itself <lb/>
            suffer by the action of other things, or will be of such a nature <lb/>
            as things are able to exist and go on in. But no thing can do <lb/>
            and suffer without body, nor aught furnish room except void and <lb/>
            vacancy. Therefore beside void and bodies no third nature taken <lb/>
            by itself can be left in the number of things, either such as to <lb/>
            fall at any time under the ken of our senses or such as any one <lb/>
            can grasp by the reason of his mind.</p>
          <p>For whatever things are named, you will either find to be <lb/>
            properties linked to these two things or you will see to be ac­ <lb/>
            cidents of these things. That is a property which can in no case <lb/>
            be disjoined and separated without utter destruction accompany­ <lb/>
            ing the severance, such as the weight of a stone, the heat of fire, <lb/>
            the fluidity of water. Slavery on the other hand, poverty and <lb/>
            riches, liberty war concord and all other things which may come <lb/>
            and go while the nature of the thing remains unharmed, these <lb/>
            we are wont, as it is right we should, to call accidents. Time also <lb/>
            exists not by itself, but simply from the things which happen the <lb/>
            sense apprehends what has been done in time past, as well as <lb/>
            what is present and what is to follow after. And we must admit <lb/>
            that no one feels time by itself abstracted from the motion and <lb/>
            calm rest of things. So when they say that the daughter of <lb/>
            Tyndarus was ravished and the Trojan nations were subdued in <lb/>
            war, we must mind that they do not force us to admit that these <lb/>
            things are by themselves, since those generations of men, of whom <pb n="12"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="467−509"/> <lb/>
            these things were accidents, time now gone by has irrevocably <lb/>
            swept away. For whatever shall have been done may be termed <lb/>
            an accident in one case of the Teucran people, in another of the <lb/>
            countries simply. Yes for if there had been no matter of things <lb/>
            and no room and space in which things severally go on, never had <lb/>
            the fire, kindled by love of the beauty of Tyndarus' daughter, <lb/>
            blazed beneath the Phrygian breast of Alexander and lighted up <lb/>
            the famous struggles of cruel war, nor had the timber horse un­ <lb/>
            known to the Trojans wrapt Pergama in flames by its night- <lb/>
            issuing brood of sons of the Greeks; so that you may clearly <lb/>
            perceive that all actions from first to last exist not by themselves <lb/>
            and are not by themselves in the way that body is, nor are terms <lb/>
            of the same kind as void is, but are rather of such a kind that <lb/>
            you may fairly call them accidents of body and of the room in <lb/>
            which they severally go on.</p>
          <p>Bodies again are partly first-beginnings of things, partly those <lb/>
            which are formed of a union of first-beginnings. But those which <lb/>
            are first-beginnings of things no force can quench : they are sure <lb/>
            to have the better by their solid body. Although it seems dif­ <lb/>
            ficult to believe that aught can be found among things with a <lb/>
            solid body. For the lightning of heaven passes through the walls <lb/>
            of houses, as well as noise and voices; iron grows red-hot in the <lb/>
            fire and stones burn with fierce heat and burst asunder; the hard­ <lb/>
            ness of gold is broken up and dissolved by heat; the ice of brass <lb/>
            melts vanquished by the flame; warmth and piercing cold ooze <lb/>
            through silver, since we have felt both, as we held cups with the <lb/>
            hand in due fashion and the water was poured down into them. <lb/>
            So universally there is found to be nothing solid in things. But <lb/>
            yet because true reason and the nature of things constrains, <lb/>
            attend until we make clear in a few verses that there are such <lb/>
            things as consist of solid and everlasting body, which we teach are <lb/>
            seeds of things and first-beginnings, out of which the whole sum <lb/>
            of things which now exists has been produced.</p>
          <p>First of all then since there has been found to exist a two-fold <lb/>
            and widely dissimilar nature of two things, that is to say of body <lb/>
            and of place in which things severally go on, each of the two must <lb/>
            exist for. and by itself and quite unmixed. For wherever there <lb/>
            is empty space which we call void, there body is not; wherever <lb/>
            again body maintains itself, there empty void no wise exists. <pb n="13"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="510−555"/> <lb/>
            First bodies therefore arc solid and without void. Again since <lb/>
            there is void in things begotten, solid matter must exist about <lb/>
            this void, and no thing can be proved by true reason to conceal <lb/>
            in its body and have within it void, unless you choose to allow <lb/>
            that that which holds it in is solid. Again that can be nothing <lb/>
            but a union of matter which can keep in the void of things. <lb/>
            Matter therefore, which consists of a solid body, may be ever­ <lb/>
            lasting, though all things else are dissolved. Moreover if there <lb/>
            were no empty void, the universe would be solid; unless on the <lb/>
            other hand there were certain bodies to fill up whatever places <lb/>
            they occupied, the existing universe would be empty and void <lb/>
            space. Therefore sure enough body and void are marked off <lb/>
            in alternate layers, since the universe is neither of a perfect <lb/>
            fulness nor a perfect void. There are therefore certain bodies <lb/>
            which can vary void space with full. These can neither be <lb/>
            broken in pieces by the stroke of blows from without nor have <lb/>
            their texture undone by aught piercing to their core nor give way <lb/>
            before any other kind of assault; as we have proved to you a <lb/>
            little before. For without void nothing seems to admit of being <lb/>
            crushed in or broken up or split in two by cutting, or of taking in <lb/>
            wet or permeating cold or penetrating fire, by which all things are <lb/>
            destroyed. And the more anything contains within it of void, the <lb/>
            more thoroughly it gives way to the assault of these things. <lb/>
            Therefore if first bodies are as I have shewn solid and without <lb/>
            void, they must be everlasting. Again unless matter had been <lb/>
            eternal, all things before this would have utterly returned to <lb/>
            nothing and whatever things we see would have been born anew <lb/>
            from nothing. But since I have proved above that nothing can <lb/>
            be produced from nothing, and that what is begotten cannot be <lb/>
            recalled to nothing, first-beginnings must be of an imperishable <lb/>
            body, into which all things can be dissolved at their last hour,. <lb/>
            that there may be a supply of matter for the reproduction of <lb/>
            things. Therefore first-beginnings are of solid singleness, and in <lb/>
            no other way can they have been preserved through ages during <lb/>
            infinite time past in order to reproduce things.</p>
          <p>Again if nature had set no limit to the breaking of things, <lb/>
            by this time the bodies of matter would have been so far reduced <lb/>
            by the breaking of past ages that nothing could within a fixed <lb/>
            time be conceived out of them and reach its utmost growth of <pb n="14"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="556−601"/> <lb/>
            being. For we see that anything is more quickly destroyed than <lb/>
            again renewed ; and therefore that which the long, the infinite <lb/>
            duration of all bygone time had broken up demolished and de­ <lb/>
            stroyed, could never be reproduced in all remaining time. But <lb/>
            now sure enough a fixed limit to their breaking has been set, <lb/>
            since we see each thing renewed, and at the same time definite <lb/>
            periods fixed for things each after its kind to reach the flower of <lb/>
            their age. Moreover while the bodies of matter are most solid, <lb/>
            it may yet be explained in what way all things which are formed <lb/>
            soft, as air- water earth fires, are so formed and by what force <lb/>
            they severally go on, since once for all there is void mixed up <lb/>
            in things. But on the other hand if the first-beginnings of things <lb/>
            be soft, it cannot be explained out of what enduring basalt and <lb/>
            iron can be produced; for their whole nature will utterly lack <lb/>
            a first foundation to begin with. First-beginnings therefore are <lb/>
            strong in solid singleness, and by a denser combination of these <lb/>
            all things can be closely packed and exhibit enduring strength.</p>
          <p>Again if no limit has been set to the breaking of bodies, never­ <lb/>
            theless the several bodies which go to things must survive from <lb/>
            eternity up to the present time, not yet assailed by any danger. <lb/>
            But since they are possessed of a frail nature, it is not consistent <lb/>
            with this that they could have continued through eternity ha­ <lb/>
            rassed through ages by countless blows. Again too since a limit of <lb/>
            growing and sustaining life has been assigned to things each after <lb/>
            its kind, and since by the laws of nature it stands decreed what <lb/>
            they can each do and what they cannot do, and since nothing is <lb/>
            changed, but all things are so constant that the different birds <lb/>
            all in succession exhibit in their body the distinctive marks of <lb/>
            their kind, they must sure enough have a body of unchangeable <lb/>
            matter also. For if the first-beginnings of things could in any <lb/>
            way be vanquished and changed, it would then be uncertain too <lb/>
            what could and what could not rise into being, in short on what <lb/>
            principle each thing has its powers defined, its deep-set boundary <lb/>
            mark; nor could the generations reproduce so often each after its <lb/>
            kind the nature habits, way of life and motions of the parents.</p>
          <p>Then again since there is ever a bounding point [to bodies, <lb/>
            which appears to us to be a least, there ought in the same way to <lb/>
            be a bounding point the least conceivable] to that first body which <lb/>
            already is beyond what our senses can perceive : that point sure <pb n="15"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="601−646"/> <lb/>
            enough is without parts and consists of a least nature and never <lb/>
            has existed apart by itself and will not be able in future so to <lb/>
            exist, since it is in itself a part of that other; and so a first and <lb/>
            single part and then other and other similar parts in succession fill up <lb/>
            in close serried mass the nature of the first body; and since these <lb/>
            cannot exist by themselves, they must cleave to that from which <lb/>
            they cannot in any way be torn. First-beginnings therefore are of <lb/>
            solid singleness, massed together and cohering closely by means of <lb/>
            least parts, not compounded out of a union of those parts, but, <lb/>
            rather, strong in everlasting singleness. From them nature allows <lb/>
            nothing to be torn, nothing further to be worn away, reserving <lb/>
            them as seeds for things. Again unless there shall be a least, the <lb/>
            very smallest bodies will consist of infinite parts, inasmuch as the <lb/>
            half of the half will always have a half and nothing will set bounds <lb/>
            to the division. Therefore between the sum of things and the <lb/>
            least of things what difference will there be ? There will be no <lb/>
            distinction at all; for how absolutely infinite soever the whole sum <lb/>
            is, yet the things which are smallest will equally consist of infinite <lb/>
            parts. Now since on this head true reason protests and denies <lb/>
            that the mind can believe it, you must yield and admit that there <lb/>
            exist such things as are possessed of no parts and are of a least <lb/>
            nature. And since these exist, those first bodies also you must <lb/>
            admit to be solid and everlasting. Once more, if nature creatress <lb/>
            of things had been wont to compel all things to be broken up into <lb/>
            least parts, then too she would be unable to reproduce anything <lb/>
            out of those parts, because those things which are enriched with <lb/>
            no parts cannot have the properties which begetting matter ought <lb/>
            to have, I mean the various entanglements weights blows clashings <lb/>
            motions, by means of which things severally go on.</p>
          <p>For which reasons they who have held fire to be the matter of <lb/>
            things and the sum to be formed out of fire alone, are seen to have <lb/>
            strayed most widely from true reason. At the head of whom <lb/>
            enters Heraclitus to do battle, famous for obscurity more among <lb/>
            the frivolous than the earnest Greeks who seek the truth. For <lb/>
            fools admire and like all things the more which they perceive to <lb/>
            be concealed under involved language, and determine things to be <lb/>
            true which can prettily tickle the ears and are varnished over <lb/>
            with finely sounding phrase.</p>
          <p>For I want to know how things can be so various, if they are <pb n="16"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="646−689"/> <lb/>
            formed out of fire one and unmixed: it would avail nothing for <lb/>
            hot fire to be condensed or rarefied, if the same nature which the <lb/>
            whole fire has, belonged to the parts of fire as well. The heat <lb/>
            would be more intense by compression of parts, more faint by <lb/>
            their severance and dispersion. More than this you cannot think <lb/>
            it in the power of such causes to effect, far less could so great a <lb/>
            diversity of things come from mere density and rarity of fires. <lb/>
            Observe also, if they suppose void to be mixed up in things, fire <lb/>
            may then be condensed and left rare; but because they see many <lb/>
            things rise tip in contradiction to them and shrink from leaving <lb/>
            unmixed void in things, fearing the steep, they lose the true road, <lb/>
            and do not perceive on the other hand that if void is taken from <lb/>
            things, all things are condensed and out of all things is formed <lb/>
            one single body, which cannot briskly radiate anything from it, in <lb/>
            the way heat-giving fire emits light and warmth, letting you see <lb/>
            that it is not of closely compressed parts. But if they haply <lb/>
            think that in some other way fires may be quenched in the union <lb/>
            and change their body, you are to know that if they shall scruple <lb/>
            on no side to do this, all heat sure enough will be utterly brought <lb/>
            to nothing, and all things that are produced will be formed out <lb/>
            of nothing. For whenever a thing changes and quits its proper <lb/>
            limits, at once this change of state is the death of that which was <lb/>
            before. Therefore something or other must needs be left to those <lb/>
            fires of theirs undestroyed, that you may not have all things abso­ <lb/>
            lutely returning to nothing, and the whole store of things born <lb/>
            anew and flourishing out of nothing. Since then in fact there are <lb/>
            some most unquestionable bodies which always preserve the same <lb/>
            nature, on whose going or coming and change of order things <lb/>
            change their nature and bodies are transformed, you are to know <lb/>
            that these first bodies of things are not of fire. For it would <lb/>
            matter nothing that some should withdraw and go away and <lb/>
            others should be added on and some should have their order <lb/>
            changed, if one and all they yet retained the nature of heat; for <lb/>
            whatever they produced would be altogether fire. But thus me­ <lb/>
            thinks it is: there are certain bodies whose clashings motions order <lb/>
            position and shapes produce fires, and which by a change of order <lb/>
            change the nature of the things and do not resemble fire nor any­ <lb/>
            thing else which has the power of sending bodies to our senses <lb/>
            and touching by its contact our sense of touch.</p><pb n="17"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="690−733"/><lb/>
            Again to say that all things are fire and that no real thing <lb/>
            except fire exists in the number of things, as this same man does, <lb/>
            appears to be sheer dotage. For he himself takes his stand on <lb/>
            the side of the senses to fight against the senses and shakes their <lb/>
            authority, on which rests all our belief, ay from which this fire as <lb/>
            he calls it is known to himself; for he believes that the senses <lb/>
            can truly perceive fire, he does not believe they can perceive all <lb/>
            other things which are not a whit less clear. Now this appears <lb/>
            to me to be as false as it is foolish : for to what shall we appeal ? <lb/>
            what surer test can we have than the senses, whereby to note <lb/>
            truth and falsehood ? Again why should any one rather abolish <lb/>
            all things and choose to leave the single nature of heat, than <lb/>
            deny that fires exist, while he allows any thing else to be ? it <lb/>
            seems to be equal madness to affirm either this or that.</p>
          <p>For these reasons they who have held that fire is the matter of <lb/>
            things and that the sum can be formed out of fire, and they who <lb/>
            have determined air to be the first-beginning in begetting things, <lb/>
            and all who have held that water by itself alone forms things, or <lb/>
            that earth produces all things and changes into all the different <lb/>
            natures of things, appear to have strayed exceedingly wide of the <lb/>
            truth: as well as they who make the first-beginnings of things <lb/>
            twofold coupling air with fire and earth with water, and they who <lb/>
            believe that all things grow out of four things, fire earth and air <lb/>
            and water. Chief of whom is Agrigentine Empedocles : him within <lb/>
            the three-cornered shores of its lands that island bore, about which <lb/>
            the Ionian sea flows in large cranklings, and splashes up brine <lb/>
            from its green waves. Here the sea racing in its straitened frith <lb/>
            divides by its waters the shores of Italians lands from the other's <lb/>
            coasts; here is wasteful Charybdis and here the rumblings of <lb/>
            Aetna threaten anew to gather up such fury of flames, as again <lb/>
            with force to belch forth the fires bursting from its throat and <lb/>
            carry up to heaven once more the lightnings of flame. Now <lb/>
            though this great country is seen to deserve in many ways the <lb/>
            wonder of mankind and is held to be well worth visiting, rich in <lb/>
            all good things, guarded by large force of men, yet seems it to <lb/>
            have held within it nothing more glorious than this man, nothing <lb/>
            more holy marvellous and dear. The verses too of his godlike <lb/>
            genius cry with a loud voice and set forth in such wise his glorious <lb/>
            discoveries that he hardly seems born of a mortal stock. <note type="footnote"> AT. III. </note> <note type="footnote"> B </note> <pb n="18"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="734−778"/>Yet he and those whom we have mentioned above immea­ <lb/>
            surably inferior and far beneath him, although, the authors of <lb/>
            many excellent and godlike discoveries, they have given responses <lb/>
            from so to say their hearts' holy of holies with more sanctity and <lb/>
            on much more unerring grounds than the Pythia who speaks out <lb/>
            from the tripod and laurel of Phoebus, have yet gone to ruin in <lb/>
            the first-beginnings of things: it is there they have fallen, and, <lb/>
            great themselves, great and heavy has been that fall; first because <lb/>
            they have banished void from things and yet assign to them mo­ <lb/>
            tions, and allow things soft and rare, air sun fire earth, living <lb/>
            things and corn, and yet mix not up void in their body; next be­ <lb/>
            cause they suppose that there is no limit to the division of bodies <lb/>
            and no stop set to their breaking and that there exists no least <lb/>
            at all in things; though we see that that is the bounding point <lb/>
            of any thing which seems to be least to our senses, so that from <lb/>
            this you may infer that because the things which you do not see <lb/>
            have a bounding point, there is a least in them. Moreover since <lb/>
            they assign soft first-beginnings of things, which we see to have <lb/>
            birth and to be of a body altogether mortal, the sum of things <lb/>
            must in that case revert to nothing and the store of things be <lb/>
            born anew and flourish out of nothing: how wide now of the truth <lb/>
            both these doctrines are you will already comprehend. In the <lb/>
            next place these bodies are in many ways mutually hostile and <lb/>
            poisonous; and therefore they will either perish when they have <lb/>
            met, or will fly asunder just as we see, when a storm has gathered, <lb/>
            lightnings and rains and winds fly asunder.</p>
          <p>Again if all things are produced from four things and all again <lb/>
            broken up into those things, how can they be called first-begin­ <lb/>
            nings of things any more than things be called their first-begin­ <lb/>
            nings, the supposition being reversed ? For they are begotten <lb/>
            time about and interchange colour and their whole nature without <lb/>
            ceasing. But if haply you suppose that the body of fire and of <lb/>
            earth and air and the moisture of water meet in such a way that <lb/>
            none of them in the union changes its nature, no thing I tell you <lb/>
            can be then produced out of them, neither living thing nor thing <lb/>
            with inanimate body, as a tree; in fact each thing amid the med­ <lb/>
            ley of this discordant mass will display its own nature and air will <lb/>
            be seen to be mixed up with earth and heat to remain in union <lb/>
            with moisture. But first-beginnings ought in begetting things to <pb n="19"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="779−822"/> <lb/>
            bring with them a latent and unseen nature in order that no <lb/>
            thing stand out, to be in the way and prevent whatever is pro­ <lb/>
            duced from having its own proper being.</p>
          <p>Moreover they go back to heaven and its fires for a beginning, <lb/>
            and first suppose that fire changes into air, next that from air <lb/>
            water is begotten and earth is produced out of water, and that all <lb/>
            in reverse order come back from earth, water first, next air, then <lb/>
            heat, and that these cease not to interchange, to pass from heaven <lb/>
            to earth, from earth to the stars of ether. All which first-begin­ <lb/>
            nings must on no account do; since something unchangeable must <lb/>
            needs remain over, that things may not utterly be brought back to <lb/>
            nothing. For whenever a thing changes and quits its proper <lb/>
            limits, at once this change of state is the death of that which was <lb/>
            before. Wherefore since those things which we have mentioned a <lb/>
            little before pass into a state of change, they must be formed out <lb/>
            of others which cannot in any case be transformed, that you may not <lb/>
            have things returning altogether to nothing. Why not rather hold <lb/>
            that there are certain bodies possessed of such a nature, that, if <lb/>
            they have haply produced fire, the same may, after a few have <lb/>
            been taken away and a few added on and the order and motion <lb/>
            changed, produce air; and that all other things may in the same <lb/>
            way interchange with one another ?</p>
          <p>' But plain matter of fact clearly proves' you say 'that all things <lb/>
            grow up into the air and are fed out of the earth; and unless the <lb/>
            season at the propitious period send such abundant showers that <lb/>
            the trees reel beneath the soaking storms of rain, and unless the <lb/>
            sun on its part foster them and supply heat, corn trees and living <lb/>
            things could not grow'. Quite true, and unless solid food and soft <lb/>
            water should recruit us, our substance would waste away and life <lb/>
            break wholly up out of all the sinews and bones; for we beyond <lb/>
            doubt are recruited and fed by certain things, this and that other <lb/>
            thing by certain other things. Because many first-beginnings <lb/>
            common to many things in many ways are mixed up in things, <lb/>
            therefore sure enough different things are fed by different <lb/>
            things. And it often makes a great difference with what <lb/>
            things and in what position the same first-beginnings are <lb/>
            held in union and what motions they mutually impart and <lb/>
            receive; for the same make up heaven sea lands rivers sun, the <lb/>
            same make up corn trees and living things; but they are mixed <note type="footnote"> B 2 </note> <lb/>
            <pb n="20"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="822−864"/><lb/>
            up with different things and in different ways as they move. Nay <lb/>
            you see throughout even in these verses of ours many elements <lb/>
            common to many words, though you must needs admit that the <lb/>
            lines and words differ one from the other both in meaning and in <lb/>
            the sound wherewith they sound. So much can elements effect <lb/>
            by a mere change of order; but those elements which are the first- <lb/>
            beginnings of things can bring with them more combinations out <lb/>
            of which different things can severally be produced.</p>
          <p>Let us now also examine the homoeomeria of Anaxagoras as the <lb/>
            Greeks term- it, which the poverty of our native speech does not <lb/>
            allow us to name in our own tongue; though it is easy enough to <lb/>
            set forth in words the thing itself. First of all then, when he <lb/>
            speaks of the homoeomeria of things, you must know he supposes <lb/>
            bones to be formed out of very small and minute bones and flesh <lb/>
            of very small and minute fleshes and blood by the coming together <lb/>
            of many drops of blood, and gold he thinks can be composed of <lb/>
            grains of gold and earth be a concretion of small earths, and fires <lb/>
            can come from fires and water from waters, and everything else he <lb/>
            fancies and supposes to be produced on a like principle. And yet <lb/>
            at the same time he does not allow that void exists anywhere in <lb/>
            things, or that there is a limit to the division of things. Where­ <lb/>
            fore he appears to me on both these grounds to be as much mis­ <lb/>
            taken as those whom we have already spoken of above. Moreover <lb/>
            the first-beginnings which he supposes are too frail; if first-begin­ <lb/>
            nings they be which are possessed of a nature like to the things <lb/>
            themselves and are just as liable to suffering and death, and which <lb/>
            nothing reins back from destruction. For which of them will hold <lb/>
            out, so as to escape death, beneath so strong a pressure within the <lb/>
            very jaws of destruction ? fire or water or air ? which of these ? <lb/>
            blood or bones ? Not one methinks, where everything will be just <lb/>
            as essentially mortal as those things which we see with the senses <lb/>
            perish before our eyes vanquished by some force. But I appeal to <lb/>
            facts demonstrated above for proof that things cannot fall away to <lb/>
            nothing nor on the other hand grow from nothing. Again since <lb/>
            food gives increase and nourishment to the body, you are to know <lb/>
            that our veins and blood and bones [and the like are formed of <lb/>
            things foreign to them in kind]; or if they shall say that all foods <lb/>
            are of a mixed body and contain in them small bodies of sinews <lb/>
            and bones and veins as well and particles of blood, it will follow <pb n="21"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="864−903"/> <lb/>
            that all food, solid as well as liquid, must be held to be composed <lb/>
            of things foreign to them in kind, of bones that is and sinews and <lb/>
            matter and blood mixed up. Again if all the bodies which grow <lb/>
            out of the earth, are in the earths, the earth must be composed of <lb/>
            things foreign to it in kind which grow out of these earths. Apply <lb/>
            again this reasoning to other things, and you may use just the <lb/>
            same words. If flame and smoke and ash are latent in woods, <lb/>
            woods must necessarily be composed of things foreign to them in <lb/>
            kind. Again all those bodies, to which the earth gives food, it <lb/>
            increases [out of things foreign to them in kind which rise out of <lb/>
            the earth : thus too the bodies of flame which issue from the woods, <lb/>
            are fed] out of things foreign to them in kind which rise out of <lb/>
            these woods.</p>
          <p>Here some slight opening is left for evasion, which Anaxagoras <lb/>
            avails himself of, choosing to suppose that all things though latent <lb/>
            are mixed up in things, and that is alone visible of which there <lb/>
            are the largest number of bodies in the mixture and these more <lb/>
            ready to hand and stationed in the first rank. This however is far <lb/>
            banished from true reason. For then it were natural that corn too <lb/>
            should often, when crushed by the formidable force of the stone, <lb/>
            shew some mark of blood or some other of the things which have <lb/>
            their nourishment in our body. For like reasons it were fitting <lb/>
            that from grasses too, when we rub them between two stones, blood <lb/>
            should ooze out; that waters should yield sweet drops, in flavour <lb/>
            like to the udder of milk in sheep; yes and that often, when clods <lb/>
            of earth have been crumbled, kinds of grasses and corn and leaves <lb/>
            should be found to lurk distributed among the earth in minute <lb/>
            quantities; and lastly that ash and smoke and minute fires should <lb/>
            be found latent in woods, when they were broken off. Now since <lb/>
            plain matter of fact teaches that none of these results follows, you <lb/>
            are to know that things are not so mixed up in things; but rather <lb/>
            seeds common to many things must in many ways be mixed up <lb/>
            and latent in things.</p>
          <p>' But it often comes to pass on high mountains' you say ' that <lb/>
            contiguous tops of tall trees rub together, the strong south winds <lb/>
            constraining them so to do, until the flower of flame has broken <lb/>
            out and they have burst into a blaze '. Quite true and yet fire is <lb/>
            not innate in woods; but there are many seeds of heat, and when <lb/>
            they by rubbing have streamed together, they produce conflagra­ <lb/>
            <pb n="22"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="903−947"/><lb/>
            tions in the forests. But if the flame was stored up ready made <lb/>
            in the forests, the fire could not be concealed for any length of <lb/>
            time, but would destroy forests, burn up trees indiscriminately. <lb/>
            Do you now see, as we said a little before, that it often makes a <lb/>
            very great difference with what things and in what position the <lb/>
            same first-beginnings are held in union and what motions they <lb/>
            mutually impart and receive, and that the same may when a little <lb/>
            changed in arrangement produce say fires and a fir ? just as the <lb/>
            words too consist of elements only a little changed in arrangement, <lb/>
            though we denote firs and fires with two quite distinct names. <lb/>
            Once again, if you suppose that whatever you perceive among <lb/>
            visible things cannot be produced without imagining bodies of <lb/>
            matter possessed of a like nature, in this way, you will find, the <lb/>
            first-beginnings of things are destroyed: it will come to this that <lb/>
            they will be shaken by loud fits of convulsive laughter and will <lb/>
            bedew with salt tears face and cheeks.</p>
          <p>Now mark and learn what remains to be known and hear it <lb/>
            more distinctly. Nor does my mind fail to perceive how dark the <lb/>
            things are; but the great hope of praise has smitten my heart with <lb/>
            sharp thyrsus, and at the same time has struck into my breast <lb/>
            sweet love of the muses, with which now inspired I traverse in <lb/>
            blooming thought the pathless haunts of the Pierides never yet <lb/>
            trodden by sole of man. I love to approach the untasted springs <lb/>
            and to quaff, I love to cull fresh flowers and gather for my head a <lb/>
            distinguished crown from spots whence the muses have yet veiled --. <lb/>
            the brows of none; first because I teach of great things and essay <lb/>
            to release the mind from the fast bonds of religious scruples, and <lb/>
            next because on a dark subject I pen such lucid verses o'erlaying <lb/>
            all with the muses' charm. For that too would seem to be not with­ <lb/>
            out good grounds : just as physicians when they purpose to give <lb/>
            nauseous wormwood to children, first smear the rim round the <lb/>
            bowl with the sweet yellow juice of honey. that the unthinking <lb/>
            age of children may be fooled as far as the lips, and meanwhile <lb/>
            drink up the bitter draught of wormwood and though beguiled yet <lb/>
            not be betrayed, but rather by such means recover health and <lb/>
            strength ; so I now, since this doctrine seems generally somewhat <lb/>
            bitter to those by whom it has not been handled, and the multitude <lb/>
            shrinks back from it in dismay, have resolved to set forth to you <lb/>
            our doctrine in sweet-toned Pierian verse and o'erlay it as it were <lb/>
            <pb n="23"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="947−987"/><lb/>
            with the pleasant honey of the muses, if haply by such means I <lb/>
            might engage your mind on my verses, till you clearly perceive <lb/>
            the whole nature of things, its shape and frame.</p>
          <p>But since I have taught that most solid bodies of matter fly <lb/>
            about for ever unvanquished through all time, mark now, let us <lb/>
            unfold whether there is or is not any limit to their sum ; likewise <lb/>
            let us clearly see whether that which has been found to be void, or <lb/>
            room and space, in which things severally go on, is all of it altoge­ <lb/>
            ther finite or stretches without limits and to an unfathomable depth.</p>
          <p>Well then the existing universe is bounded in none of its <lb/>
            dimensions; for then it must have had an outside. Again it is <lb/>
            seen that there can be an outside of nothing, unless there be <lb/>
            something beyond to bound it, so that that is seen, farther than <lb/>
            which the nature of this our sense does not follow the thing. <lb/>
            Now since we must admit that there is nothing outside the sum, <lb/>
            it has no outside, and therefore is without end and limit. And it <lb/>
            matters not in which of its regions you take your stand; so invari­ <lb/>
            ably, whatever position any one has taken up, he leaves the uni­ <lb/>
            verse just as infinite as before in all directions. I Again if for the <lb/>
            moment all existing space be held to be bounded, supposing a <lb/>
            man runs forward to its outside borders and stands on the utmost <lb/>
            verge and then throws a winged javelin, do you choose that when <lb/>
            hurled with vigorous force it shall advance to the point to which <lb/>
            it has been sent and fly to a distance, or do you decide that some­ <lb/>
            thing can get in its way and stop it ? for you must admit and adopt <lb/>
            one of the two suppositions; either of which shuts you out from <lb/>
            all escape and compels you to grant that the universe stretches <lb/>
            without end For whether there is something to get in its way <lb/>
            and prevent its coming whither it was sent and placing itself in <lb/>
            the point intended, or whether it is carried forward, in either case <lb/>
            it has not started from the end. In this way I will go on and, <lb/>
            wherever you have placed the outside borders, I will ask what <lb/>
            then becomes of the javelin. The result will be that an end can <lb/>
            no where be fixed, and that the room given for flight will still <lb/>
            prolong the power of flight. Lastly one thing is seen by the eyes <lb/>
            to end another thing; air bounds off hills, and mountains air, earth <lb/>
            limits sea and sea again all lands; the universe however there is <lb/>
            nothing outside to end.</p><pb n="24"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="988−1027"/><lb/>
            Again if all the space of the whole sum were enclosed within <lb/>
            fixed borders and were bounded, in that case the store of matter <lb/>
            by its solid weights would have streamed together from all sides <lb/>
            to the lowest point nor could anything have gone on under the <lb/>
            canopy of heaven, no nor would there have been a heaven nor sun­ <lb/>
            light at all, inasmuch as all matter, settling down through infinite <lb/>
            time past, would lie together in a heap. But as it is, sure enough <lb/>
            no rest is given to the bodies of the first-beginnings, because there <lb/>
            is no lowest point at all, to which they might stream together as <lb/>
            it were, and where they might take up their positions. All things <lb/>
            are ever going on in ceaseless motion onall sides and bodies of <lb/>
            matter stirred to action are supplied from beneath out of infinite <lb/>
            space. Therefore the nature of room and the space of the un­ <lb/>
            fathomable void are such as bright thunderbolts cannot race through <lb/>
            in their course though gliding on through endless tract of time, <lb/>
            no nor lessen one jot the journey that remains to go by all their <lb/>
            travel: so huge a room is spread out on all sides for things with­ <lb/>
            out any bounds in all directions round.</p>
          <p>Again nature keeps the sum of things from setting any limit to <lb/>
            itself, since she compels body to be ended by void and void in turn <lb/>
            by body, so that either she thus renders the universe infinite by <lb/>
            this alternation of the two, or else the one of the two, in case the <lb/>
            other does not bound it, with its single nature stretches neverthe­ <lb/>
            less immeasurably. [But void I have already proved to be infi­ <lb/>
            nite ; therefore matter must be infinite : for if void were infinite, <lb/>
            and matter finite] neither sea nor earth nor the glittering quarters <lb/>
            of heaven nor mortal kind nor the holy bodies of the gods could <lb/>
            hold their ground one brief passing hour; since forced asunder <lb/>
            from its union the store of matter would be dissolved and borne <lb/>
            along the mighty void, or rather I should say would never have <lb/>
            combined to produce any thing, since scattered abroad it could <lb/>
            never have been brought together. For verily not by design did <lb/>
            the first-beginnings of things station themselves each in its right <lb/>
            place guided by keen intelligence, nor did they bargain sooth to <lb/>
            say what motions each should assume, but because many in num­ <lb/>
            ber and shifting about in many ways throughout the universe they <lb/>
            are driven and tormented by blows during infinite time past, after <lb/>
            trying motions and unions of every kind at length they fall into <lb/>
            * <pb n="25"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="1027−1068"/> <lb/>
            arrangements such as those out of which this our sum of things <lb/>
            has been formed, and by which too it is preserved through many <lb/>
            great years when once it has been thrown into the appropriate <lb/>
            motions, and causes the streams to replenish the greedy sea with <lb/>
            copious river waters and the earth, fostered by the heat of the sun, <lb/>
            to renew its produce, and the race of living things to come up and <lb/>
            flourish, and the gliding fires of ether to live: all which these <lb/>
            several things could in no wise bring to pass, unless a store of <lb/>
            matter could rise up from infinite space, out of which store they <lb/>
            are wont to make up in due season whatever has been lost:-'- <lb/>
            For as the nature of living things when robbed of food loses, its <lb/>
            substance and wastes away, thus all things must be broken up, as <lb/>
            soon as matter has ceased to be supplied, diverted in any way <lb/>
            from its proper course. Nor can blows from without hold together <lb/>
            all the sum which has been brought into union. They can it is <lb/>
            true frequently strike upon and stay a part, until others come and <lb/>
            the sum can be completed. At times however they are compelled <lb/>
            to rebound and in so doing grant to the first-beginnings of things <lb/>
            room and time for flight, to enable them to get clear away from <lb/>
            the mass in union. Wherefore again and again I repeat many <lb/>
            bodies must rise up; nay for the blows themselves not to fail, <lb/>
            there is need of an infinite supply of matter on all sides.</p>
          <p>And herein, Memmius, be far from believing this, that all <lb/>
            things as they say press to the centre of the sum, and that for <lb/>
            this reason the nature of the world stands fast without any strokes <lb/>
            from the outside and the uppermost and lowest parts cannot part <lb/>
            asunder in any direction, because all things have been always <lb/>
            pressing towards the centre (if you can believe that anything can <lb/>
            rest upon itself); or that the heavy bodies which are beneath the <lb/>
            earth all press upwards and are at rest on the earth, turned topsy­ <lb/>
            turvy, just like the images of things we see before us in the waters. <lb/>
            In the same way they maintain that living things walk head <lb/>
            downwards and cannot tumble out of earth into the parts of <lb/>
            heaven lying below them any more than our bodies can spon­ <lb/>
            taneously fly into the quarters of heaven; that when those see <lb/>
            the sun, we behold the stars of night; and that they share with us <lb/>
            time about the seasons of heaven and pass nights equal in length <lb/>
            to our days. But groundless [error has devised such dreams] <pb n="26"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="1068−1112"/> <lb/>
            for fools, because they have embraced [false principles of reason.] <lb/>
            For there can be no centre [where the universe is] infinite; <lb/>
            no nor, even if there were a centre, could anything take up a <lb/>
            position there [any more on that account] than for some quite <lb/>
            different reason [be driven away.] For all room and space, which <lb/>
            we term void, must through centre, through no-centre alike give <lb/>
            place to heavy bodies, in whatever directions their motions tend. <lb/>
            Nor is there any spot of such a sort that when bodies have reached <lb/>
            it, they can lose their force of gravity and stand upon void ; and <lb/>
            that again which is void must not serve to support anything, but <lb/>
            must, as its nature craves, continually give place. Things cannot <lb/>
            therefore in such a way be held in union, o'er-mastered by love of <lb/>
            a centre.</p>
          <p>Again since they do not suppose that all bodies press to the <lb/>
            centre, but only those of earth, and those of water, [both such as <lb/>
            descend to the earth in rain] and those which are held in by the <lb/>
            earth's body, so to say, the fluid of the sea and great waters from <lb/>
            the mountains; while on the other hand they teach that the <lb/>
            subtle element of air and hot fires at the same time are carried <lb/>
            away from the centre and that for this reason the whole ether <lb/>
            round bickers with signs and the sun's flame is fed throughout <lb/>
            the blue of heaven, because heat flying from the centre all gathers <lb/>
            together there, and that the topmost boughs of trees could not <lb/>
            put forth leaves at all, unless from time to time [nature supplied] <lb/>
            food from the earth to each [throughout both stem and boughs, <lb/>
            their reasons are not only false, but they contradict each other. <lb/>
            Space I have already proved to be infinite; and pace being <lb/>
            infinite matter as I have said must also be infinite] lest after the <lb/>
            winged fashion of flames the walls of the world should suddenly <lb/>
            break up and fly abroad along the mighty void, and all other <lb/>
            things follow for like reasons and the innermost quarters of heaven <lb/>
            tumble in from above and the earth in an instant withdraw from <lb/>
            beneath our feet and amid the commingled ruins of things in it <lb/>
            and of heaven, ruins unloosing the first bodies, should wholly pass <lb/>
            away along the unfathomable void, so that in a moment of time <lb/>
            not a wrack should be left behind, nothing save untenanted space <lb/>
            and viewless first-beginnings. For on whatever side you shall <lb/>
            first determine first bodies to be wanting, this side will be the <pb n="27"/>

            gate of death for things, through this the whole crowd of matter <lb/>
            will fling itself abroad.</p>
          <p>If you will throughly con these things, then carried to the end <lb/>
            with slight trouble [you will be able by yourself to understand <lb/>
            all the rest.] For one thing after another will grow clear and <lb/>

            among them of intellect, the rivalry of birth, the striving night <lb/>
            and day with surpassing effort to struggle up to the summit of <lb/>
            power and be masters of the world. 0 miserable minds of men ! <lb/>
            o blinded breasts ! in what darkness of life and in how great <lb/>
            dangers is passed this term of life whatever its duration! not <lb/>
            choose to see that nature craves for herself no more than this, <lb/>
            that pain hold aloof from the body, and she in mind enjoy a <lb/>
            feeling of pleasure exempt from care and fear ? Therefore we see <lb/>
            that for the body's nature few things are needed at all, such and <lb/>
            such only as take away pain. Nay, though more gratefully at <lb/>
            times they can minister to us many choice delights, nature for her <lb/>
            part wants them not, when there are no golden images of youths <lb/>
            through the house holding in their right hands flaming lamps for <lb/>
            supply of light to the nightly banquet, when the house shines not <lb/>
            with silver nor glitters with gold nor do the pannelled and gilded <lb/>
            roofs reecho to the harp, what time, though these things be want­ <pb n="29"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="29−72"/> <lb/>
            ing, they spread themselves in groups on the soft grass beside <lb/>
            a stream of water under the boughs of a high tree and at no great <lb/>
            cost pleasantly refresh their bodies, above all when the weather <lb/>
            smiles and the seasons of the year besprinkle the green grass with <lb/>
            flowers. Nor do hot fevers sooner quit the body, if you toss about <lb/>
            on pictured tapestry and blushing purple, than if you must lie <lb/>
            under a poor man's blanket. Wherefore since treasures avail <lb/>
            nothing in respect of our body nor birth nor the glory of kingly <lb/>
            power, advancing farther you must hold that they are of no service <lb/>
            to the mind as well; unless may be when you see your legions <lb/>
            swarm over the ground of the campus waging the mimicry of war, <lb/>
            strengthened flank and rear by powerful reserves and great force <lb/>
            of cavalry, and you marshall them equipped in arms and animated <lb/>
            with one spirit, thereupon you find that religious scruples scared <lb/>
            by these things fly panic-stricken from the mind; and that then <lb/>
            fears of death leave the breast unembarrassed and free from care, <lb/>
            when you see your fleet swarm forth and spread itself far and <lb/>
            wide. But if we see that these things are food for laughter and <lb/>
            mere mockeries, and in good truth the fears of men and dogging <lb/>
            cares dread not the clash of arms and cruel weapons, if unabashed <lb/>
            they mix among kings and kesars and stand not in awe of the <lb/>
            glitter from gold nor the brilliant sheen of the purple robe, how <lb/>
            can you doubt that this is wholly the prerogative of reason, when <lb/>
            the whole of life withal is a struggle in the dark? For even <lb/>
            as children are flurried and dread all things in the thick darkness, <lb/>
            thus we in the daylight fear at times things not a whit more <lb/>
            to be dreaded than those which children shudder at in the dark <lb/>
            and fancy sure to be. This terror therefore and darkness of mind <lb/>
            must be dispelled not by the rays of the sun and glittering shafts <lb/>
            of day, but by the aspect and law of nature.</p>
          <p>Now mark and I will explain by what motion the begetting <lb/>
            bodies of matter do beget different things and after they are begot­ <lb/>
            ten again break them up, and by what force they are compelled <lb/>
            so to do and what velocity is given to them for travelling through <lb/>
            the great void: do you mind to give heed to my words. For verily <lb/>
            matter does not cohere inseparably massed together, since we see <lb/>
            that everything wanes and perceive that all things ebb as it were <lb/>
            by length of time and that age withdraws them from our sight, <lb/>
            though yet the sum is seen to remain unimpaired by reason that <pb n="30"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="72−114"/> <lb/>
            the bodies which quit each thing, lessen the things from which <lb/>
            they go, gift with increase those to which they have come, compel <lb/>
            the former to grow old, the latter to come to their prime, and yet <lb/>
            abide not with these. Thus the sum of things is ever renewed and <lb/>
            mortals live by a reciprocal dependency. Some nations wax, others <lb/>
            wane, and in a brief space the races of living things are changed <lb/>
            and like runners hand over the lamp of life.</p>
          <p>If you think that first-beginnings of things can lag and by <lb/>
            lagging give birth to new motions of things, you wander far astray <lb/>
            from the path of true reason : since they travel about through <lb/>
            void, the first-beginnings of things must all move on either by <lb/>
            their own weight or haply by the stroke of another. For when <lb/>
            during motion they have, as often happens, met and clashed, the <lb/>
            result is a sudden rebounding in an opposite direction; and no <lb/>
            wonder, since they are most hard and of weight proportioned <lb/>
            to their solidity and nothing behind gets in their way. And that <lb/>
            you may more clearly see that all bodies of matter are in restless <lb/>
            movement, remember that there is no lowest point in the sum of <lb/>
            the universe, and that first bodies have not where to take their <lb/>
            stand, since space is without end and limit and extends immea­ <lb/>
            surably in all directions round, as I have shewn in many words <lb/>
            and as has been proved by sure reason. Since this then is a <lb/>
            certain truth, sure enough no rest is given to first bodies through­ <lb/>
            out the unfathomable void, but driven on rather in ceaseless and <lb/>
            varied motion they partly, after they have pressed together, <lb/>
            rebound leaving great spaces between, while in part they are so <lb/>
            dashed away after the stroke as to leave but small spaces between. <lb/>
            And all that form a denser aggregation when brought together <lb/>
            and rebound leaving trifling spaces between, held fast by their <lb/>
            own close-tangled shapes, these form enduring bases of stone and <lb/>
            unyielding bodies of iron and the rest of their class, few in num­ <lb/>
            ber, which travel onward along the great void. All the others <lb/>
            spring far off and rebound far leaving great spaces between : these <lb/>
            furnish us with thin air and bright sunlight. And many more <lb/>
            travel along the great void, which have been thrown off from the <lb/>
            unions of things or though admitted have yet in no case been able <lb/>
            likewise to assimilate their motions. Of this truth, which I am <lb/>
            telling, we have a representation and picture always going on <lb/>
            before our eyes and present to us: observe whenever the rays are <pb n="31"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="115−157"/> <lb/>
            let in and pour the sunlight through the dark chambers of houses: <lb/>
            you will see many minute bodies in many ways through the apparent <lb/>
            void mingle in the midst of the light of the rays, and as in never- <lb/>
            ending conflict skirmish and give battle combating in troops and <lb/>
            never halting, driven about in frequent meetings and partings; so <lb/>
            that you may guess from this, what it is for first-beginnings of <lb/>
            things to be ever tossing about in the great void. So far as it <lb/>
            goes, a small thing may give an illustration of great things and <lb/>
            put you on the track of knowledge. And for this reason too it is <lb/>
            meet that you should give greater heed to these bodies which are <lb/>
            seen to tumble about in the sun's rays, because such tumblings <lb/>
            imply that motions also of matter latent and unseen are at the <lb/>
            bottom. For you will observe many things there impelled by un­ <lb/>
            seen blows to change their course and driven back to return the <lb/>
            way they came now this way now that way in all directions round. <lb/>
            All you are to know derive this restlessness from the first-begin­ <lb/>
            nings. For the first-beginnings of things move first of themselves; <lb/>
            next those bodies which form a small aggregate and come nearest <lb/>
            so to say to the powers of the first-beginnings, are impelled and <lb/>
            set in movement by the unseen strokes of those first bodies, and <lb/>
            they next in turn stir up bodies which are a little larger. Thus <lb/>
            motion mounts up from the first-beginnings and step by step issues <lb/>
            forth to our senses, so that those bodies also move, which we can <lb/>
            discern in the sunlight, though it is not clearly seen by what blows <lb/>
            they so act.</p>
          <p>Now what velocity is given to bodies of matter, you may <lb/>
            apprehend, Memmius, in few words from this: when morning first <lb/>
            sprinkles the earth with fresh light and the different birds flitting <lb/>
            about the pathless woods through the buxom air fill all places with <lb/>
            their clear notes, we see it to be plain and evident to all how <lb/>
            suddenly the sun after rising is wont at such a time to overspread <lb/>
            all things and clothe them with his light. But that heat which <lb/>
            the sun emits and that bright light pass not through empty void ; <lb/>
            and therefore they are forced to travel more slowly, until they <lb/>
            cleave through the waves so to speak of air. Nor do the several <lb/>
            minute bodies of heat pass on one by one, but closely entangled <lb/>
            and massed together; whereby at one and the same time they are <lb/>
            pulled back by one another and are impeded from without, so that <lb/>
            they are forced to travel more slowly. But the first-beginnings <pb n="32"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="157−198"/> <lb/>
            which arc of solid singleness, when they pass through empty void <lb/>
            and nothing delays them from without and they themselves, single <lb/>
            from the nature of their parts, are borne with headlong endeavour <lb/>
            towards the one single spot to which their efforts tend, must sure <lb/>
            enough surpass in velocity and be carried along much more swiftly <lb/>
            than the light of the sun, and race through many times the extent <lb/>
            of space in the same time in which the beams of the sun fill the <lb/>
            heaven throughout. * nor follow up the several first-beginnings to <lb/>
            see by what law each thing goes on.</p>
          <p>But some in opposition to this, ignorant of matter, believe that <lb/>
            nature cannot without the providence of the gods in such nice <lb/>
            conformity to the ways of men vary the seasons of the year and <lb/>
            bring forth crops, ay and all the other things, which divine <lb/>
            pleasure the guide of life prompts men to approach, escorting them <lb/>
            in person and enticing them by her fondlings to continue their <lb/>
            races through the arts of Venus, that mankind may not come to an <lb/>
            end. Now when they suppose that the gods designed all things <lb/>
            for the sake of men, they seem to me in all respects to have <lb/>
            strayed most widely from true reason. For even if I did not know <lb/>
            what first-beginnings are, yet this, judging by the very arrange­ <lb/>
            ments of heaven, I would venture to affirm, and led by many other <lb/>
            circumstances to maintain, that the nature of the world has by no <lb/>
            means been made for us by divine power: so great are the defects <lb/>
            with which it stands encumbered. All which, Memmius, we will <lb/>
            hereafter make clear to you: we will now go on to explain what <lb/>
            remains to be told of motions.</p>
          <p>Now methinks is the place, herein to prove this point also that <lb/>
            no bodily thing can by its own power be borne upwards and travel <lb/>
            upwards; that the bodies of flames may not in this manner lead <lb/>
            you into error. For they are begotten with an upward tendency, <lb/>
            and in the same direction receive increase, and goodly crops and <lb/>
            trees grow upwards, though their weights, so far as in them is, all <lb/>
            tend downwards. And when fires leap to the roofs of houses and <lb/>
            with swift flame lick up rafters and beams, we are not to suppose <lb/>
            that they do so spontaneously without a force pushing them up. <lb/>
            Even thus blood discharged from our body spirts out and springs <lb/>
            up on high and scatters gore about. See you not too with what <lb/>
            force the liquid of water spits out logs and beams ? the more <lb/>
            deeply we have pushed them sheer down and have pressed them <pb n="33"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="198−241"/> <lb/>
            in, many of us together, with all our might and much painful <lb/>
            effort, with the greater avidity it vomits them up and casts them <lb/>
            forth, so that they rise and start out more than half their length. <lb/>
            And yet methinks we doubt not that these, so far as in them is, <lb/>
            are all borne downwards through the empty void. In the same <lb/>
            way flames also ought to be able, when squeezed out, to mount <lb/>
            upward through the air, although their weights, so far as in them <lb/>
            is, strive to draw them down. See you not too that the nightly <lb/>
            meteors of heaven as they fly aloft draw after them long trails of <lb/>
            flames in whatever direction nature has given them a passage ? <lb/>
            Do you not perceive stars and constellations fall to the earth ? <lb/>
            The sun also from the height of heaven sheds its heat on all <lb/>
            sides and sows the fields with light; to the earth therefore as <lb/>
            well the sun's heat tends. Lightnings also you see fly athwart <lb/>
            the rains : now from this side now from that fires burst from <lb/>
            the clouds and rush about; the force of flame falls to the earth <lb/>
            all round.</p>
          <p>This point too herein we wish you to apprehend: when bodies <lb/>
            are borne downwards sheer through void by their own weights, at <lb/>
            quite uncertain times and uncertain spots they push themselves a <lb/>
            little from their course : you just and only just can call it a change <lb/>
            of inclination. If they were not used to swerve, they would all <lb/>
            fall down, like drops of rain, through the deep void, and no clashing <lb/>
            would have been begotten nor blow produced among the first- <lb/>
            beginnings: thus nature never would have produced aught.</p>
          <p>But if haply any one believes that heavier bodies, as they are <lb/>
            carried more quickly sheer through space, can fall from above on <lb/>
            the lighter and so beget blows able to produce begetting motions, <lb/>
            he goes most widely astray from true reason. For whenever bodies <lb/>
            fall through water and thin air, they must quicken their descents <lb/>
            in proportion to their weights, because the body of water and <lb/>
            subtle nature of air cannot retard everything in equal degree, but <lb/>
            more readily give way, overpowered by the heavier: on the other <lb/>
            hand empty void cannot offer resistance to anything in any direc­ <lb/>
            tion at any time, but must, as its nature craves, continually give <lb/>
            way; and for this reason all things must be moved and borne <lb/>
            along with equal velocity though of unequal weights through the <lb/>
            unresisting void. Therefore heavier things will never be able to <lb/>
            fall from above on lighter nor of themselves to beget blows <note type="footnote"> M. III. </note> <note type="footnote"> c </note> <pb n="34"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="242−283"/> <lb/>
            sufficient to produce the varied motions by which nature carries on <lb/>
            things. Wherefore again and again I say bodies must swerve a <lb/>
            little; and yet not more than the least possible ; lest we be found <lb/>
            to be imagining oblique motions and this the reality should refute. <lb/>
            For this we see to be plain and evident, that weights, so far as in <lb/>
            them is, cannot travel obliquely, when they fall from above, at <lb/>
            least so far as you can perceive ; but that nothing swerves in any <lb/>
            case from the straight course, who is there that can perceive ?</p>
          <p>Again if all motion is ever linked together and a new motion <lb/>
            ever springs from another in a fixed order and first-beginnings do <lb/>
            not by swerving make some commencement of motion to break <lb/>
            through the decrees of fate, that cause follow not cause from ever­ <lb/>
            lasting, whence have all living creatures here on earth, whence, I <lb/>
            ask, has been wrested from the fates the power by which we go <lb/>
            forward whither the will leads each, by which likewise we change <lb/>
            the direction of our motions neither at a fixed time nor fixed place, <lb/>
            but when and where the mind itself has prompted ? For beyond <lb/>
            a doubt in these things his own will makes for each a beginning <lb/>
            and from this beginning motions are welled through the limbs. <lb/>
            See you not too, when the barriers are thrown open at a given <lb/>
            moment, that yet the eager powers of the horses cannot start <lb/>
            forward so instantaneously as the mind itself desires ? the whole <lb/>
            store of matter through the whole body must be sought out, in <lb/>
            order that stirred up through all the frame it may follow with <lb/>
            undivided effort the bent of the mind; so that you see the begin­ <lb/>
            ning of motion is born from the heart, and the action first com­ <lb/>
            mences in the will of the mind and next is transmitted through <lb/>
            the whole body and frame. Quite different is the case when we <lb/>
            move on propelled by a stroke inflicted by the strong might and <lb/>
            strong compulsion of another; for then it is quite clear that all the <lb/>
            matter of the whole body moves and is hurried on against our <lb/>
            inclination, until the will has reined it in throughout the limbs. <lb/>
            Do you see then in this case that, though an outward force often <lb/>
            pushes men on and compels them frequently to advance against <lb/>
            their will and to be hurried headlong on, there yet is something in <lb/>
            our breast sufficient to struggle against and resist it ? And when <lb/>
            too this something chooses, the store of matter is compelled some­ <lb/>
            times to change its course through the limbs and-frame, and <lb/>
            after it has been forced forward, is reined in and settles back into <pb n="35"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="283−326"/> <lb/>
            its place. Wherefore in seeds too you must admit the same, <lb/>
            admit that besides blows and weights there is another cause of <lb/>
            motions, from which this power of free action has been begotten <lb/>
            in us, since we see that nothing can come from nothing. For <lb/>
            weight forbids that all things be done by blows through as it <lb/>
            were an outward force; but that the mind itself does not feel <lb/>
            an internal necessity in all its actions and is not as it were over­ <lb/>
            mastered and compelled to bear and put up with this, is caused <lb/>
            by a minute swerving of first-beginnings at no fixed part of space <lb/>
            and no fixed time.</p>
          <p>Nor was the store of matter ever more closely massed nor held <lb/>
            apart by larger spaces between; for nothing is either added to <lb/>
            its bulk or lost to it. Wherefore the bodies of the first-begin­ <lb/>
            nings in time gone by moved in the same way in which now <lb/>
            they move, and will ever hereafter be borne along in like manner, <lb/>
            and the things which have been wont to be begotten will be be­ <lb/>
            gotten after the same law and will be and will grow and will wax <lb/>
            in strength so far as is given to each by the decrees of nature. <lb/>
            And no force can change the sum of things ; for there is nothing <lb/>
            outside, either into which any kind of matter can escape out of <lb/>
            the universe or out of which a new supply can arise and burst <lb/>
            into the universe and change all the nature of things and alter <lb/>
            their motions.</p>
          <p>And herein you need not wonder at this, that though the <lb/>
            first-beginnings of things are all in motion, yet the sum is seen <lb/>
            to rest in supreme repose, unless where a thing exhibits motions <lb/>
            with its individual body. For all the nature of first things lies <lb/>
            far away from our senses beneath their ken; and therefore since <lb/>
            they are themselves beyond what you can see, they must withdraw <lb/>
            from sight their motion as well; and the more so that the things <lb/>
            which we can see, do yet often conceal their motions when a great <lb/>
            distance off. Thus often the woolly flocks as they crop the glad <lb/>
            pastures on a hill, creep on whither the grass jewelled with fresh <lb/>
            dew summons and invites each, and the lambs fed to the full <lb/>
            gambol and playfully butt; all which objects appear to us from <lb/>
            a distance to be blended together and to rest like a white spot <lb/>
            on a green, hill. Again when mighty legions fill with their move­ <lb/>
            ments all parts of the plains waging the mimicry of war, the <lb/>
            glitter then lifts itself up to the sky and the whole earth round <note type="footnote"> c 2 </note> <pb n="36"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="326−367"/> <lb/>
            gleams with brass and beneath a noise is raised by the mighty <lb/>
            trampling of men and the mountains stricken by the shouting <lb/>
            reecho the voices to the stars of heaven, and horsemen fly about <lb/>
            and suddenly wheeling scour across the middle of the plains, <lb/>
            shaking them with the vehemence of their charge. And yet <lb/>
            there is some spot on the high hills, seen from which they appear <lb/>
            to stand still and to rest on the plains as a bright spot.</p>
          <p>Now mark and next in order apprehend of what kind and <lb/>
            how widely differing in their forms are the beginnings of all <lb/>
            things, how varied by manifold diversities of shape; not that a <lb/>
            scanty number are possessed of a like form, but because as a rule <lb/>
            they do not all resemble one the other. And no wonder; for <lb/>
            since there is so great a store of them that, as I have shewn, there <lb/>
            is no end or sum, they must sure enough not one and all be <lb/>
            marked by an equal bulk and like shape, one with another. Let <lb/>
            the race of man pass before you in review, and the mute swim­ <lb/>
            ming shoals of the scaly tribes and the blithe herds and wild <lb/>
            beasts and the different birds which haunt the gladdening <lb/>
            watering spots about river-banks and springs and pools, and <lb/>
            those which flit about and throng the pathless woods: then go <lb/>
            and take any one you like in any one kind, and you will yet <lb/>
            find that they differ in their shapes, every one from every other. <lb/>
            And in no other way could child recognise mother or mother <lb/>
            child; and this we see that they all can do, and that they are <lb/>
            just as well known to one another as human beings are. Thus <lb/>
            often in front of the beauteous shrines of the- gods a calf falls <lb/>
            sacrificed beside the incense-burning altars, and spirts from its <lb/>
            breast a warm stream of blood ; but the bereaved mother as she <lb/>
            ranges over the green lawns knows the footprints stamped on the <lb/>
            ground by the cloven hoofs, scanning with her eyes every spot <lb/>
            to see if she can anywhere behold her lost youngling: then she <lb/>
            fills with her meanings the leafy wood each time she desists from <lb/>
            her search and again and again goes back to the stall pierced to <lb/>
            the heart by the loss of her calf; nor can the soft willows and <lb/>
            grass quickened with dew and yon rivers gliding level with their <lb/>
            banks comfort her mind and put away the care that has entered <lb/>
            into her, nor can other forms of calves throughout the glad pas­ <lb/>
            tures divert her mind and ease it of its care: so persistently she <lb/>
            seeks something special and known. Again the tender kids with <pb n="37"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="367−408"/> <lb/>
            their shaking voices know their horned dams and the butting <lb/>
            lambs the flocks of bleating sheep: thus they run, as nature <lb/>
            craves, each without fail to its own udder of milk. Lastly in the <lb/>
            case of any kind of corn you like you will yet find that any one <lb/>
            grain is not so similar to any other in the same kind, but that <lb/>
            there runs through them some difference to distinguish the forms. <lb/>
            On a like principle of difference we see the class of shells paint <lb/>
            the lap of earth, where the sea with gentle waves beats on the <lb/>
            thirsty sand of the winding shore. Therefore again and again <lb/>
            I say it is necessary for like reasons that first-beginnings of things, <lb/>
            since they exist by nature and are not made by hand after the <lb/>
            exact model of one, should fly about with shapes in some cases <lb/>
            differing one from the other.</p>
          <p>It is right easy for us on such a principle to explain why the <lb/>
            fire of lightning has much more power to pierce than ours which <lb/>
            is born of earthly pinewood: you may say that the heavenly fire <lb/>
            of lightning subtle as it is is formed of smaller shapes and therefore <lb/>
            passes through openings which this our fire cannot pass born as <lb/>
            it is of woods and sprung from pine. Again light passes through <lb/>
            horn, but rain is thrown off. Why? but that those first bodies <lb/>
            of light are smaller than those of which the nurturing liquid of <lb/>
            water is made. And quickly as we see wines flow through a <lb/>
            strainer, sluggish oil on the other hand is slow to do so, because <lb/>
            sure enough it consists of elements either larger in size or more <lb/>
            hooked and tangled in one another, and therefore it is that the <lb/>
            first-beginnings of things cannot so readily be separated from each <lb/>
            other and severally stream through the several openings of any <lb/>
            thing.</p>
          <p>Moreover the liquids honey and milk excite a pleasant sen­ <lb/>
            sation of tongue when held in the mouth; but on the other hand <lb/>
            the nauseous nature of wormwood and of harsh centaury writhes <lb/>
            the mouth with a noisome flavour; so that you may easily see <lb/>
            that the things which are able to affect the senses pleasantly, <lb/>
            consist of smooth and round elements; while all those on the <lb/>
            other hand which are found to be bitter and harsh, are held in <lb/>
            connexion by particles that are more hooked and for this reason <lb/>
            are wont to tear open passages into our senses and in entering in <lb/>
            to break through the body.</p>
          <p>All things in short which are agreeable to the senses and all <pb n="38"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="408−452"/> <lb/>
            which are unpleasant to the feeling are mutually repugnant, <lb/>
            formed as they are out of an unlike first shape; lest haply you <lb/>
            suppose that the harsh grating of the creaking saw consists of <lb/>
            elements as smooth as those of tuneful melodies which musicians <lb/>
            wake into life with nimble fingers and give shape to on strings; <lb/>
            or suppose that the first-beginnings are of like shape which pass <lb/>
            into the nostrils of men, when noisome carcases are burning, <lb/>
            and when the stage is fresh sprinkled with Cilician saffron, while <lb/>
            the altar close, by exhales Panchaean odours; or decide that the <lb/>
            pleasant colours of things which are able to feast the eyes are <lb/>
            formed of a seed like to the seed of those which make the pupil <lb/>
            smart and force it to shed tears or from their disgusting aspect <lb/>
            look hideous and foul. For every shape which gratifies the senses <lb/>
            has been formed not without a smoothness in its elements; but on <lb/>
            the other hand whatever is painful and harsh, has been produced <lb/>
            not without some roughness of matter. There are too some <lb/>
            elements which are with justice thought to be neither smooth nor <lb/>
            altogether hooked with barbed points, but rather to have minute <lb/>
            angles slightly projecting, so that they can tickle rather than <lb/>
            hurt the senses; of which class tartar of wine is formed and the <lb/>
            flavours of elecampane. Again that hot fires and cold frost have <lb/>
            fangs of a dissimilar kind wherewith to pierce the senses, is <lb/>
            proved to us by the touch of each. For touch, touch, ye holy <lb/>
            divinities of the gods, the body's feeling is, either when an <lb/>
            extraneous thing makes its way in, or when a thing which is born <lb/>
            In. the body hurts it, or gives pleasure as it issues forth by the <lb/>
            birth-bestowing ways of Venus, or when from some collision the <lb/>
            seeds are disordered within the body and distract the feeling by <lb/>
            their mutual disturbance ; as if haply you were yourself to strike <lb/>
            with the hand any part of the body you please and so make trial. <lb/>
            Wherefore the shapes of the first-beginnings must differ widely, <lb/>
            since they are able to give birth to different feelings.</p>
          <p>Again things which look to us hard and dense must consist of <lb/>
            particles more hooked together, and be held in union because <lb/>
            welded all through with branch-like elements. In this class first <lb/>
            of all diamond stones stand in foremost line inured to despise <lb/>
            blows, and stout blocks of basalt and the strength of hard iron <lb/>
            and brass bolts which scream out as they hold fast to their <lb/>
            staples. Those things which are liquid and of fluid body ought <pb n="39"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="451−493"/> <lb/>
            to consist more of smooth and round elements; for the several <lb/>
            drops have no mutual cohesion and their onward course too has <lb/>
            a ready flow downwards. All things lastly which you see disperse <lb/>
            themselves in an instant, as smoke mists and flames, if they do <lb/>
            not consist entirely of smooth and round, must yet not be held <lb/>
            fast by closely tangled elements, so that they may be able to <lb/>
            pierce the body and enter it with biting power, yet not stick <lb/>
            together: thus you may easily know, that whatever we see the <lb/>
            senses have been able to allay, consists not of tangled but of <lb/>
            pointed elements. Do not however hold it to be wonderful that <lb/>
            some things which are fluid you see to be likewise bitter, for <lb/>
            instance the sea's moisture: because it is fluid, it consists of <lb/>
            smooth and round particles, and many rough bodies mixed up <lb/>
            with these produce pains; and yet they must not be hooked so <lb/>
            as to hold together: you are to know that though rough, they <lb/>
            are yet spherical, so that while they roll freely on, they may at <lb/>
            the same time hurt the senses. And that you may more readily <lb/>
            believe that with smooth are mixed rough first-beginnings from <lb/>
            which Neptune's body is made bitter, there is a way of separating <lb/>
            these, and of seeing how the fresh water, when it is often filtered <lb/>
            through the earth, flows by itself into a trench and sweetens; for <lb/>
            it leaves above the first-beginnings of the nauseous saltness, inas­ <lb/>
            much as the rough particles can more readily stay behind in the <lb/>
            earth.</p>
          <p>And now that I have shewn this, I will go on to link to it a <lb/>
            truth which depends on this and from this draws its proof: the <lb/>
            first-beginnings of things have different shapes, but the number of <lb/>
            shapes is finite. If this were not so, then once more it would <lb/>
            follow that some seeds must be of infinite bulk of body. For in the <lb/>
            same seed, in the single small size of any first body you like the <lb/>
            shapes cannot vary much from one another: say for instance that <lb/>
            first bodies consist of three least parts, or augment them by a few <lb/>
            more; when to wit in all possible ways, by placing each in turn at <lb/>
            the top and at the bottom, by making the right change places <lb/>
            with the left, you shall have tried all those parts of one first body <lb/>
            and found what manner of shape each different arrangement gives <lb/>
            to the whole of that body, if after all this haply you shall wish <lb/>
            still to vary the shapes, you will have to add other parts; it will <lb/>
            next follow that for like reasons the arrangement will require <pb n="40"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="493−535"/> <lb/>
            other parts, if haply you shall wish still again to vary the shapes. <lb/>
            From all this it results that increase of bulk in the body follows <lb/>
            upon newness of the shapes. Wherefore you cannot possibly <lb/>
            believe that seeds have an infinite variety of forms, lest you force <lb/>
            some to be of a monstrous hugeness, which as I have above shewn <lb/>
            cannot be proved. Moreover I tell you barbaric robes and radiant <lb/>
            Meliboean purple dipped in Thessalian dye of shells [and the hues <lb/>
            which are displayed] by the golden brood of peacocks steeped in <lb/>
            laughing beauty would all be thrown aside surpassed by some new <lb/>
            colour of things; the smell of myrrh would be despised and the <lb/>
            flavours of honey, and the melodies of the swan and Phoebcan <lb/>
            tunes set off by the varied play of strings would in like sort be <lb/>
            suppressed and silenced; for something ever would arise more <lb/>
            surpassing than the rest. All things likewise might fall back into <lb/>
            worse states, even as we have said they might advance to better; <lb/>
            for reversely too one thing would be more noisome than all other <lb/>
            things to nostril ear and eye and taste. Now since these things <lb/>
            are not so, but a fixed limit has been assigned to things which <lb/>
            bounds their sum on each side, you must admit that matter also <lb/>
            has a finite number of different shapes. Once more from summer <lb/>
            fires to chill frosts a definite path is traced out and in like manner <lb/>
            is again travelled back; for every degree of cold and heat and <lb/>
            intermediate warmths lie between those extremes, filling up in <lb/>
            succession the sum. Therefore the things produced differ by finite <lb/>
            degrees, since at both ends they are marked off by points, one at <lb/>
            one, another at the other end, molested on the one hand by <lb/>
            flames, on the other by stiffening frosts.</p>
          <p>And now that I have shewn this, I will go on to link to it a <lb/>
            truth which depends on this and from this draws its proof: the <lb/>
            first-beginnings of things which have a like shape one with the <lb/>
            other, are infinite in number. For since the difference of forms is <lb/>
            finite, those which are like must be infinite or the sum of matter <lb/>
            will be finite, which I proved not to be the case, when I shewed in <lb/>
            my verses that the minute bodies of matter from everlasting <lb/>
            continually uphold the sum of things through an uninterrupted <lb/>
            succession of blows on all sides. For though you see that some <lb/>
            animals are rarer than others and discern a less fruitful nature in <lb/>
            them, yet in another quarter and spot and in distant lands there <lb/>
            may be many of that kind and the full tale may be made up; just <pb n="41"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="536−577"/> <lb/>
            as we see that in the class of four-footed beasts snake-handed ele­ <lb/>
            phants are elsewhere especially numerous; for India is so fenced <lb/>
            about with an ivory rampart made out of many thousands of these, <lb/>
            that its inner parts cannot be reached, so great is the quantity of <lb/>
            brutes, of which we see but very few samples. But yet though I <lb/>
            should grant this point too: be there even as you will some one <lb/>
            thing sole in its kind existing alone with a body that had birth, <lb/>
            and let no other thing resemble it in the whole world; yet unless <lb/>
            there shall be an infinite supply of matter out of which it may be <lb/>
            conceived and brought into being, it cannot be produced, and, <lb/>
            more than this, it cannot have growth and food. For though I <lb/>
            should assume this point also that birth-giving bodies of some one <lb/>
            thing are tossed about in finite quantity throughout the universe, <lb/>
            whence, where, by what force and in what way shall they meet <lb/>
            together and combine in so vast a sea, such an alien medley of <lb/>
            matter? They have methinks no way of uniting; but even as <lb/>
            when great and numerous shipwrecks have occurred, the great sea <lb/>
            is wont to tumble about banks rudders yards prow masts and <lb/>
            swimming oars, so that poop-fittings are seen floating about along <lb/>
            every shore and utter to mortals a warning to try to shun the <lb/>
            snares and violence and guile of the faithless sea, and never at any <lb/>
            time to trust to it, when the winning face of calm ocean laughs <lb/>
            treacherously; thus too if you shall once decide that certain first- <lb/>
            beginnings are finite, different currents of matter must scatter and <lb/>
            tumble them about through all time, so that they can never be <lb/>
            brought into union and combine, nor abide in any union nor grow <lb/>
            up and increase. But plain matter of fact shews that each of <lb/>
            these results manifestly does take place, that things can be brought <lb/>
            into being and when begotten advance in growth. It is clear then <lb/>
            that in any class you like the first-beginnings of things are infinite, <lb/>
            out of which all supplies are furnished.</p>
          <p>Thus neither can death-dealing motions keep the mastery <lb/>
            always nor entomb existence for evermore, nor on the other hand <lb/>
            can the birth and increase giving motions of things preserve them <lb/>
            always after they are born. Thus the war of first-beginnings <lb/>
            waged from eternity is carried on with dubious issue: now here <lb/>
            now there the life-bringing elements of things get the mastery <lb/>
            and are o'ermastered in turn: with the funeral wail blends the <lb/>
            cry which babies raise when they enter the borders of light; and <pb n="42"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="578−619"/> <lb/>
            no night ever followed day nor morning night that heard not <lb/>
            mingling with the sickly infant's cries wailings the attendants on <lb/>
            death and black funeral.</p>
          <p>And herein it is proper you should keep under seal, and guard, <lb/>
            there consigned, in faithful memory this truth, that there is nothing <lb/>
            whose nature is apparent to sense, which consists of one kind of <lb/>
            first-beginnings; nothing which is not formed by a mixing of seed. <lb/>
            And whenever a thing possesses in itself in larger measure many <lb/>
            powers and properties, in that measure it shews that there are in <lb/>
            it the greatest number of different kinds and varied shapes of <lb/>
            first-beginnings. First of all the earth has in her first bodies out <lb/>
            of which springs rolling coolness along replenish without fail the <lb/>
            boundless sea, she has bodies out of which fires rise up; for in <lb/>
            many spots the earth's crust is on fire and burns, though head­ <lb/>
            strong Aetna rages with fire of surpassing force. Then too she <lb/>
            has bodies out of which she can raise for mankind goodly crops <lb/>
            and joyous trees, out of which too she can supply to the moun­ <lb/>
            tain-ranging race of wild beasts rivers leaves and glad pastures. <lb/>
            Wherefore she has alone been named great mother of gods and <lb/>
            mother of beasts and parent of our body.</p>
          <p>Of her the old and learned poets of the Greeks have sung, that <lb/>
            [borne aloft on high-raised] seat in a chariot she drives a pair of <lb/>
            lions, teaching that the great earth hangs in the expanse of air <lb/>
            and that earth cannot rest on earth. To her chariot they have <lb/>
            yoked wild beasts, because a brood however savage ought to be <lb/>
            tamed and softened by the kind offices of parents. They have en­ <lb/>
            circled the top of her head with a mural crown, because fortified <lb/>
            in choice positions she sustains towns; adorned with which em­ <lb/>
            blem the image of the divine mother is carried now-a-days through <lb/>
            wide lands in awe-inspiring state. Her different nations after <lb/>
            old-established ritual term Idacan mother, and give for escort <lb/>
            Phrygian bands, because they tell that from those lands corn first <lb/>
            began to be produced throughout the world. They assign her <lb/>
            galli, because they would shew by this type that they who have <lb/>
            done violence to the divinity of the mother and have proved un­ <lb/>
            grateful to their parents, are to be deemed unworthy to bring a <lb/>
            living offspring into the borders of light. Tight-stretched tambour­ <lb/>
            ines and hollow cymbals resound all round to the stroke of their <lb/>
            open hands, and horns menace with hoarse-sounding music, and <pb n="43"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="620−664"/> <lb/>
            the hollow pipe stirs their minds in Phrygian mood. They carry <lb/>
            weapons before them, emblems of furious rage, meet to fill the <lb/>
            thankless souls and godless breasts of the rabble with terror for <lb/>
            the divinity of the goddess. Therefore when first borne in pro­ <lb/>
            cession through great cities she mutely enriches mortals with a <lb/>
            blessing not expressed in words, they straw all her path with brass <lb/>
            and silver presenting her with bounteous alms, and scatter over <lb/>
            her a snow-shower of roses, o'ershadowing the mother and her <lb/>
            troops of attendants. Here an armed band to which the Greeks <lb/>
            give the name of Phrygian Curetes, in that it haply joins in the <lb/>
            game of arms and springs up in measure all dripping with blood, <lb/>
            shaking with its nodding the frightful crests upon the head, re­ <lb/>
            presents the Dictaean Curetes who, as the story is, erst drowned in <lb/>
            Crete that infant cry of Jove, when the young band about the <lb/>
            young babe in rapid dance arms in hand to measured tread beat <lb/>
            brass on brass, that Saturn might not get him to consign to his <lb/>
            devouring jaws and stab the mother to the heart with a never- <lb/>
            healing wound. For these reasons they escort in arms the great <lb/>
            mother, or else because they mean by this sign that the goddess <lb/>
            preaches to men to be willing with arms and valour to defend <lb/>
            their country and be ready to be a safeguard and an ornament to <lb/>
            their parents. All which, well and beautifully as it is set forth <lb/>
            and told, is yet widely removed from true reason. For the nature <lb/>
            of gods must ever in itself of necessity enjoy immortality together <lb/>
            with supreme repose, far removed and withdrawn from our con­ <lb/>
            cerns ; since exempt from every pain, exempt from all dangers, <lb/>
            strong in its own resources, not wanting aught of us, it is neither <lb/>
            gained by favours nor moved by anger. And here if any one <lb/>
            thinks proper to call the sea Neptune and corn Ceres and chooses <lb/>
            rather to misuse the name of Bacchus than to utter the term that <lb/>
            belongs to that liquor, let us allow him to declare that the earth <lb/>
            is mother of the gods, if he only forbear in earnest to stain his <lb/>
            mind with foul religion. The earth however is at all time without <lb/>
            feeling, and because it receives into it the first-beginnings of <lb/>
            many things, it brings them forth in many ways into the light of <lb/>
            the sun.</p>
          <p>And so the woolly flocks and the martial breed of horses and <lb/>
            homed herds, though often cropping the grass from one field be­ <lb/>
            neath the same canopy of heaven and slaking their thirst from <pb n="44"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="664−705"/> <lb/>
            one stream of water, yet have all their life a dissimilar appearance <lb/>
            and retain the nature of their parents and severally imitate their <lb/>
            ways each after its kind: so great is the diversity of matter in <lb/>
            any kind of herbage, so great in every river. And hence too any <lb/>
            one you please out of the whole number of living creatures is <lb/>
            made up of bones blood veins heat moisture flesh sinews; and <lb/>
            these things again differ widely from one another and are com­ <lb/>
            posed of first-beginnings of unlike shape. Furthermore whatever <lb/>
            things are set on fire and burned, store up in their body, if nothing <lb/>
            else, at least those particles, out of which they may radiate fire <lb/>
            and send out light and make sparks By and scatter embers all <lb/>
            about. If you will go over all other things by a like process of <lb/>
            reasoning, you will thus find that they conceal in their body the <lb/>
            seeds of many things and contain elements of various shapes. <lb/>
            Again you see many things to which are given at once both colour <lb/>
            and taste together with smell; especially those many offerings <lb/>
            [which are burned on the altars]. These must therefore be made <lb/>
            up of elements of different shapes ; for smell enters in where colour <lb/>
            passes not into the frame, colour too in one way, taste in another <lb/>
            makes its entrance into the senses; so that you know they differ <lb/>
            in the shapes of their first elements. Therefore unlike forms <lb/>
            unite into one mass and things are made up of a mixture of seed. <lb/>
            Throughout moreover these very verses of ours you see many ele­ <lb/>
            ments common to many words, though yet you must admit that <lb/>
            the verses and words one with another are different and composed <lb/>
            of different elements; not that but few letters which are in coin­ <lb/>
            mon run through them or that no two words or verses one with <lb/>
            another are made up entirely of the same, but because as a rule <lb/>
            they do not all resemble one the other. Thus also though in other <lb/>
            things there are many first-beginnings common to many things, <lb/>
            yet they can make up one with the other a quite dissimilar <lb/>
            whole; so that men and corn and joyous trees may fairly be said <lb/>
            to consist of different elements.</p>
          <p>And yet we are not to suppose that all things can be joined <lb/>
            together in all ways; for then you would see prodigies produced <lb/>
            on all hands, forms springing up half man half beast and some­ <lb/>
            times tall boughs sprouting from the living body, and many <lb/>
            limbs of land-creatures joined with those of sea-animals, nature <lb/>
            too throughout the all-bearing lands feeding chimeras which <pb n="45"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="705−748"/> <lb/>
            breathed flames from noisome mouth. It is plain however that <lb/>
            nothing of the sort is done, since we see that all things pro­ <lb/>
            duced from fixed seeds and a fixed mother can in growing pre­ <lb/>
            serve the marks of their kind. This you are to know must take <lb/>
            place after a fixed law. For the particles suitable for each thing <lb/>
            from all kinds of food when inside the body pass into the frame <lb/>
            and joining on produce the appropriate motions; but on the <lb/>
            other hand we see nature throw out on the earth those that <lb/>
            are alien, and many things with their unseen bodies fly out of <lb/>
            the body impelled by blows : those I mean which have not been <lb/>
            able to join on to any part nor when inside to feel in unison <lb/>
            with and adopt the vital motions. But lest you haply suppose <lb/>
            that living things alone are bound by these conditions, such a <lb/>
            law keeps all things within their limits. For even as things <lb/>
            begotten are in their whole nature all unlike one the other, thus <lb/>
            each must consist of first-beginnings of unlike shape; not that <lb/>
            a scanty number are possessed of a like form, but because as a <lb/>
            rule they do not all resemble one the other. Again since the <lb/>
            seeds diner, there must be a difference in the spaces between, <lb/>
            the passages, the connexions, the weights, the blows, the clash­ <lb/>
            ings, the motions; all which not only disjoin living bodies, but <lb/>
            hold apart the lands and the whole sea, and keep all heaven <lb/>
            away from the earth.</p>
          <p>Now mark, and apprehend precepts amassed by my welcome <lb/>
            toil, lest haply you deem that those things which you see with <lb/>
            your eyes to be bright, because white are formed of white <lb/>
            principles, or that the things which are black are born from black <lb/>
            seed ; or that things which are steeped in any other colour, bear <lb/>
            that colour because the bodies of matter are dyed with a colour <lb/>
            like to it. For the bodies of matter have no colour at all either <lb/>
            like to the things or unlike. But if haply it seems to you that <lb/>
            no impression of the mind can throw itself into these bodies, you <lb/>
            wander far astray. For since men born blind who have never <lb/>
            beheld the light of the sun, yet recognise bodies by touch, though <lb/>
            linked with no colour for them from their first birth, you are to <lb/>
            know that bodies can fall under the ken of our mind too, though <lb/>
            stained with no colour. Again whatever things we ourselves <lb/>
            touch in the thick darkness, we do not perceive to be dyed with <lb/>
            any colour. And since I prove that this is the case, I will now <pb n="46"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="748−788"/> <lb/>
            shew that there are things [which are possessed of no colour]. <lb/>
            Well any colour without any exception changes into any other; <lb/>
            and this first-beginnings ought in no wise to do: something <lb/>
            unchangeable must remain over, that all things be not utterly <lb/>
            reduced to nothing. For whenever a thing changes and quits <lb/>
            its proper limits, at once this change of state is the death of that <lb/>
            which was before. Therefore mind not to dye with colour the <lb/>
            seeds of things, that you may not have all things altogether <lb/>
            returning to nothing.</p>
          <p>Moreover if no quality of colour is assigned to first-beginnings <lb/>
            and they are yet possessed of varied shapes out of which they <lb/>
            beget colours of every kind and change them about by reason <lb/>
            that it makes a great difference with what other seeds and in <lb/>
            what position the seeds are severally held in union and what <lb/>
            motions they mutually impart and receive, you can explain at <lb/>
            once with the greatest ease why those things which just before <lb/>
            were of a black colour, may become all at once of marble white­ <lb/>
            ness; as the sea, when mighty winds have stirred up its waters, <lb/>
            is changed into white waves of the brightness of marble: you <lb/>
            may say that when the matter of that which we often see to <lb/>
            be black, has been mixed up anew and the arrangement of its <lb/>
            first-beginnings has been changed and some have been added <lb/>
            and some been taken away, the immediate result is that it <lb/>
            appears bright and white. But if the waters of the sea con­ <lb/>
            sisted of azure seeds, they could in no wise become white; for <lb/>
            however much you jumble together seeds which are azure, they <lb/>
            can never pass into a marble colour. But if the seeds which <lb/>
            make up the one unmixed brightness of the sea are dyed some <lb/>
            with one, some with other colours, just as often out of different <lb/>
            forms and varied shapes something square and of a uniform <lb/>
            figure is made up, in that case it were natural that as we see <lb/>
            unlike forms contained in the square, so we should see in the <lb/>
            water of the sea or in any other one and unmixed brightness <lb/>
            colours widely unlike and different to one another. Moreover <lb/>
            the unlike figures do not in the least hinder or prevent the whole <lb/>
            figure from being a square on the outside; but the various colours <lb/>
            of things are a let and hindrance to the whole things being of a <lb/>
            uniform brightness.</p>
          <p>Then too the reason which leads and draws us on sometimes <pb n="47"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="788−831"/> <lb/>
            to assign colours to the first-beginnings of things, falls to the <lb/>
            ground, since white things are not produced from white, nor <lb/>
            those which are black from black, but out of things of various <lb/>
            colours. For white things will much more readily rise up and be <lb/>
            born from no colour than from a black or any other colour which <lb/>
            thwarts and opposes it.</p>
          <p>Moreover since colours cannot exist without light and first- <lb/>
            beginnings of things do not come out into the light, you may <lb/>
            be sure they are clothed with no colour. For what colour can <lb/>
            there be in total darkness ? nay it changes in the light itself <lb/>
            according as its brightness comes from a straight or slanting <lb/>
            stroke of light! After this fashion the down which encircles and <lb/>
            crowns the nape and throat of doves shews itself in the sun: at <lb/>
            one time it is ruddy with the hue of bright pyropus ; at another <lb/>
            it appears by a certain way of looking at it to blend with coral­ <lb/>
            red green emeralds. The tail of the peacock when it is saturated <lb/>
            with abundant light, changes in like fashion its colours as it <lb/>
            turns about. And since these colours are begotten by a certain <lb/>
            stroke of light, sure enough you must believe that they cannot <lb/>
            be produced without it. And since the pupil receives into it <lb/>
            a kind of blow, when it is said to perceive a white colour, and <lb/>
            then another, when it perceives black or any other colour, and <lb/>
            since it is of no moment with what colour the things which you <lb/>
            touch are provided, but rather with what sort of shape they are <lb/>
            furnished, you are to know that first-beginnings have no need of <lb/>
            colours, but give forth sensations of touch varying according to <lb/>
            their various shapes.</p>
          <p>Moreover since no particular kind of colour is assigned to par­ <lb/>
            ticular shapes and every configuration of first-beginnings can exist <lb/>
            in any colour, why on a like principle are not the things which <lb/>
            are formed out of them in every kind o'erlaid with colours of <lb/>
            every kind ? For then it were natural that crows too in flying <lb/>
            should often display a white colour from white wings and that <lb/>
            swans should come to be black from a black seed, or of any other <lb/>
            different colour you please.</p>
          <p>Again the more minute the parts are into which anything is <lb/>
            rent, the more you may perceive the colour fade away by little <lb/>
            and little and become extinct; as for instance if a piece of purple <lb/>
            is torn into small shreds: when it has been plucked into separate <pb n="48"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="830−869"/> <lb/>
            threads, the purple, and the scarlet far the most brilliant of <lb/>
            colours, are quite effaced ; from which you may infer that the <lb/>
            shreds part with all their colour before they come back to the <lb/>
            seeds of things.</p>
          <p>Lastly since you admit that all bodies do not utter a voice <lb/>
            nor emit a smell, for this reason you do not assign to all sounds <lb/>
            and smells. So also since we cannot perceive all things with <lb/>
            the eyes, you are to know that some things are as much denuded <lb/>
            of colour as others are without smell and devoid of sound, and <lb/>
            that the keen-discerning mind can just as well apprehend these <lb/>
            things as it can take note of things which are destitute of other <lb/>
            qualities.</p>
          <p>But lest haply you suppose that first bodies remain stripped <lb/>
            of colour alone, they are also wholly devoid of warmth and cold <lb/>
            and violent heat, and are judged to be barren of sound and drained <lb/>
            of moisture, and emit from their body no scent of their own. Just <lb/>
            as when you set about preparing the balmy liquid of sweet mar­ <lb/>
            joram and myrrh and the flower of spikenard which gives forth <lb/>
            to the nostrils a scent like nectar, before all you should seek, <lb/>
            so far as you may and can find it, the substance of scentless oil, <lb/>
            such as gives out no perfume to the nostrils, that it may as little <lb/>
            as possible meddle with and destroy by its own pungency the <lb/>
            odours mixed in its body and boiled up with it; for the same <lb/>
            reason the first-beginnings of things must not bring to the be­ <lb/>
            getting of things a smell or sound of their own, since they cannot <lb/>
            discharge anything from themselves, and for the same reason <lb/>
            no taste either nor cold nor any heat moderate or violent, and <lb/>
            the like. For as these things, be they what they may, are still <lb/>
            such as to be liable to death, whether pliant with a soft, brittle <lb/>
            with a crumbling, or hollow with a porous body, they must all <lb/>
            be withdrawn from the first beginnings, if we wish to assign to <lb/>
            things imperishable foundations for the whole sum of existence <lb/>
            to rest upon : that you may not have things returning altogether <lb/>
            to nothing.</p>
          <p>To come to another point, whatever things we perceive to <lb/>
            have sense, you must yet admit to be all composed of senseless <lb/>
            first-beginnings: manifest tokens which are open to all to ap­ <lb/>
            prehend, so far from refuting or contradicting this, do rather <lb/>
            themselves take us by the hand and constrain us to believe <pb n="49"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="870−909"/> <lb/>
            that, as I say, living things are begotten from senseless things. <lb/>
            We may see in fact living worms spring out of stinking dung, <lb/>
            when the soaked earth has gotten putridity after excessive rains; <lb/>
            and all things besides change in the same way: rivers leaves <lb/>
            and glad pastures change into cattle, cattle change their sub­ <lb/>
            stance into our bodies, and often out of these the powers of wild <lb/>
            beasts and the bodies of the strong of wing are increased. <lb/>
            Therefore nature changes all foods into living bodies and engen­ <lb/>
            ders out of them all the senses of living creatures, much in the <lb/>
            same way as she dissolves dry woods into flames and converts <lb/>
            all things into fires. Now do you see that it is of great moment <lb/>
            in what sort of arrangement the first-beginnings of things are <lb/>
            severally placed and with what others they are mixed up, when <lb/>
            they impart and receive motions ?</p>
          <p>Then again what is that which strikes your mind, affects <lb/>
            that mind and constrains it to give utterance to many dif­ <lb/>
            ferent thoughts, to save you from believing that the sensible <lb/>
            is begotten out of senseless things? Sure enough it is because <lb/>
            stones and wood and earth however mixed together are yet <lb/>
            unable to produce vital sense. This therefore it will be well to <lb/>
            remember herein, that I do not assert that the sensible and <lb/>
            sensations are forthwith begotten out of all elements without <lb/>
            exception which produce things ; but that it is of great moment <lb/>
            first how minute the particles are which make up the sensible <lb/>
            thing and then what shape they possess and what in short they <lb/>
            are in their motions arrangements and positions. None of which <lb/>
            conditions we find in woods and clods; and yet even these <lb/>
            when they have so to speak become rotten through the rains, <lb/>
            bring forth worms, because bodies of matter driven from their <lb/>
            ancient arrangements by a new condition are combined in the <lb/>
            manner needed for the begetting of living creatures. Next <lb/>
            they who hold that the sensible can be produced out of sen­ <lb/>
            sible elements, accustomed thus to derive their own sense from <lb/>
            elements [which are sensible] in their turn, [do thus render their <lb/>
            own seeds mortal,] when they make them soft; for all sense is bound <lb/>
            up with flesh sinews and veins; which in everything we see to <lb/>
            be soft and formed of a mortal body. But even suppose that these <lb/>
            things can remain eternal: they must yet I presume either have <lb/>
            the sense of some part or else be deemed to possess a sense <note type="footnote"> M. Ill. </note> <note type="footnote"> D </note> <lb/>
            <pb n="50"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="909−949"/><lb/>
            similar to the entire living creatures. But the parts cannot <lb/>
            possibly have sense by themselves alone; for all sense of the <lb/>
            different members has reference to something else; nor can the <lb/>
            hand when severed from us nor any other part of the body <lb/>
            whatever by itself maintain sensation. It remains to assume <lb/>
            that they resemble the entire living creatures. In this case it <lb/>
            is necessary that they should feel the things which we feel in <lb/>
            the same way as we do, in order that they may be able in all <lb/>
            points to work in concert with the vital sense. How then can <lb/>
            they be called first-beginnings of things and shun the paths of <lb/>
            death, seeing that they are living things, and that living things <lb/>
            are one and the same with mortal things ? Nay granting they <lb/>
            could do this, yet' by thein meeting and union they will make <lb/>
            nothing but a jumble and medley of living things; just you are <lb/>
            to know as men cattle and wild beasts would be unable to beget <lb/>
            any other thing by all their mixing with one another. But if <lb/>
            haply they lose from their body their own sense and adopt an­ <lb/>
            other, what use was it to assign what is again withdrawn ? more­ <lb/>
            over, the instance to which we had before recourse, inasmuch as <lb/>
            we see the eggs of fowls change into living chicks and worms <lb/>
            burst forth, when putridity has seized on the earth after exces­ <lb/>
            sive rains, you are to know that sensations can be begotten out <lb/>
            of no-sensations.</p>
          <p>But if haply any one shall say that sense so far may arise <lb/>
            from no-sensation by a process of change, or because it is brought <lb/>
            forth by a kind of birth, it will be enough to make plain and <lb/>
            to prove to him that no birth takes place until a union of ele­ <lb/>
            ments has first been effected, and that nothing changes without <lb/>
            their having been united. Above all senses cannot exist in any <lb/>
            body before the nature itself of the living thing has been <lb/>
            begotten, because sure enough the matter remains scattered <lb/>
            about in air rivers earth and things produced from earth, and <lb/>
            has not met together and combined in appropriate fashion the <lb/>
            vital motions by which the all-discerning senses are kindled into <lb/>
            action in each living thing.</p>
          <p>Again a blow more severe than its nature can endure, pro­ <lb/>
            strates at once any living thing and goes on to stun all the senses <lb/>
            of body and mind. For the positions of the first-beginnings are <lb/>
            broken up and the vital motions entirely stopped, until the <pb n="51"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="949−989"/> <lb/>
            matter, disordered by the shock through the whole frame, unties <lb/>
            from the body the vital fastenings of the soul and scatters it <lb/>
            abroad and forces it out through all the pores. For what more <lb/>
            can we suppose the infliction of a blow can do, than shake from <lb/>
            their place and break up the union of the several elements ? <lb/>
            Often too when the blow is inflicted with less violence, the re­ <lb/>
            maining vital motions are wont to prevail, ay, prevail and still <lb/>
            the huge disorders caused by the blow and recall each part <lb/>
            into its proper channels and shake off the motion of death now <lb/>
            reigning as it were paramount in the body and kindle afresh the <lb/>
            almost lost senses. For in what other way should the thing be <lb/>
            able to gather together its powers of mind and come back to <lb/>
            life from the very threshold of death, rather than pass on to the <lb/>
            goal to which it had almost run and so pass away ?</p>
          <p>Again since there is pain when the bodies of matter are <lb/>
            disordered by any force throughout the living flesh and frame <lb/>
            and quake in their seats within, and as when they travel back <lb/>
            into their place, a soothing pleasure ensues, you are to know <lb/>
            that first-beginnings can be assailed by no pain and can derive <lb/>
            no pleasure from themselves; since they are not formed of any <lb/>
            bodies of first-beginnings, so as to be distressed by any novelty <lb/>
            in their motion or derive from it any fruit of fostering delight; <lb/>
            and therefore they must not be possessed of any sense.</p>
          <p>Again if in order that living creatures may severally have <lb/>
            sense, sense is to be assigned to their first-beginnings as well, <lb/>
            what are we to say of those of which mankind is specifically <lb/>
            made ? sure enough they burst into fits of shaking laughter <lb/>
            and sprinkle with dewy tears face and cheeks and have the cun­ <lb/>
            ning to say much about the composition of things and to enquire <lb/>
            next what their own first-beginnings are; since like in their <lb/>
            natures to the entire mortals they must in their turn be formed <lb/>
            out of other elements, then those others out of others, so that <lb/>
            you can venture nowhere to come to a stop: yes, whatever you <lb/>
            shall say speaks and laughs and thinks, I will press you with <lb/>
            the argument that it is formed of other things performing these <lb/>
            same acts. But if we see these notions to be sheer folly and <lb/>
            madness, and a man may laugh though not made of laughing <lb/>
            things, and think and reason in learned language though not <lb/>
            formed of thoughtful and eloquent seeds, why cannot the things <note type="footnote"> D 2 </note> <lb/>
            <pb n="52"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="989−1032"/><lb/>
            which we see to have sense, just as well be made up of a mixture <lb/>
            of things altogether devoid of sense ?</p>
          <p>Again we are all sprung from a heavenly seed, all have that <lb/>
            same father, by whom mother earth the giver of increase, when <lb/>
            she has taken in from him liquid drops of moisture, conceives <lb/>
            and bears goodly crops and joyous trees and the race of man, <lb/>
            bears all kinds of brute beasts, in that she supplies food with <lb/>
            which all feed their bodies and lead a pleasant life and continue <lb/>
            their race; wherefore with good cause she has gotten the name <lb/>
            of mother. That also which before was from the earth, passes <lb/>
            back into the earth, and that which was sent from the borders <lb/>
            of ether, is carried back and taken in again by the quarters of <lb/>
            heaven. Death does not extinguish things in such a way as to <lb/>
            destroy the bodies of matter, but only breaks up the union <lb/>
            amongst them, and then joins anew the different elements with <lb/>
            others; and thus it comes to pass that all things change their <lb/>
            shapes and alter their colours and receive sensations and in a <lb/>
            moment yield them up ; so that from all this you may know it <lb/>
            matters much with what others and in what position the same <lb/>
            first-beginnings of things are held in union and what motions <lb/>
            they do mutually impart and receive, and you must not sup­ <lb/>
            pose that that which we see floating about on the surface of <lb/>
            things and now born, then at once perishing, can be a property <lb/>
            inherent in everlasting first bodies. Xay in our verses them­ <lb/>
            selves it matters much with what other elements and in what <lb/>
            kind of order the several elements are placed. If not all, yet <lb/>
            by far the greatest number are alike; but the totals composed <lb/>
            of them are made to differ by the position of these elements. <lb/>
            Thus in actual things as well when the clashings motions ar­ <lb/>
            rangement position and shapes of matter change about, the things <lb/>
            must also change.</p>
          <p>Apply now, we entreat, your mind to true reason. For a <lb/>
            new question struggles earnestly to gain your ears, a new aspect <lb/>
            of things to display itself. But there is nothing so easy as <lb/>
            not to be at first more difficult to believe than afterwards; <lb/>
            and nothing too so great, so marvellous, that all do not gradu­ <lb/>
            ally abate their admiration of it. Look up at the bright and <lb/>
            unsullied hue of heaven and the stars which it holds within <lb/>
            it, wandering all about, and the moon and the suns light of <pb n="53"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="1032−1071"/> <lb/>
            dazzling brilliancy: if all these things were now for the first time, <lb/>
            if I say they were now suddenly presented to mortals beyond all <lb/>
            expectation, what could have been named that would be more <lb/>
            marvellous than these things, or that nations beforehand would <lb/>
            less venture to believe could be ? nothing, methinks : so wondrous <lb/>
            strange had been this sight. Yet how little, you know, wearied <lb/>
            as all are to satiety with seeing, any one now cares to look up into <lb/>
            heaven's glittering quarters! Cease therefore to be dismayed by <lb/>
            the mere novelty and so to reject reason from your mind with <lb/>
            loathing: weigh the questions rather with keen judgment and if <lb/>
            they seem to you to be true, surrender, or if they are a falsehood, <lb/>
            gird yourself to the encounter. For since the sum of space is un­ <lb/>
            limited outside beyond these walls of the world, the mind seeks <lb/>
            to apprehend what there is yonder there, to which the spirit ever <lb/>
            yearns to look forward, and to which the mind's immission reaches <lb/>
            in free and unembarrassed flight.</p>
          <p>In the first place we see that round in all directions, about <lb/>
            above and underneath, throughout the universe there is no bound, <lb/>
            as I have shewn and as the thing of itself proclaims with <lb/>
            loud voice and as clearly shines out in the nature of bottomless <lb/>
            space. In no wise then can it be deemed probable, when space <lb/>
            yawns illimitable towards all points and seeds in number num­ <lb/>
            berless and sum unfathomable fly about in manifold ways driven <lb/>
            on in ceaseless motion, that this single earth and heaven have <lb/>
            been brought into being, that those bodies of matter so many in <lb/>
            number do nothing outside them; the more so that this world <lb/>
            has been made by nature, just as the seeds of things have <lb/>
            chanced spontaneously to clash, after being brought together in <lb/>
            manifold wise without purpose, without foresight, without result, <lb/>
            and at last have filtered through such seeds as, suddenly thrown <lb/>
            together, were fitted to become on each occasion the rudiments <lb/>
            of great things, of earth sea and heaven and the race of living <lb/>
            things. Wherefore again and again I say you must admit that <lb/>
            there are elsewhere other combinations of matter like to this <lb/>
            which ether holds in its greedy grasp.</p>
          <p>Again when much matter is at hand, when room is there <lb/>
            and there is no thing, no cause to hinder, things sure enough <lb/>
            must go on and be completed. Well then if on the one hand <lb/>
            there is so great a store of seeds as the whole life of living <pb n="54"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="1071−1110"/> <lb/>
            creatures cannot reckon up, and if the same force and nature <lb/>
            abide in them and have the power to throw the seeds of things <lb/>
            together into their several places in the same way as they are <lb/>
            thrown together into our world, you must admit that in other <lb/>
            parts of space there are other earths and various races of men <lb/>
            and kinds of wild beasts.</p>
          <p>Moreover in the sum of all there is no one thing which is <lb/>
            begotten single in its kind and grows up single and sole of its <lb/>
            kind; but a thing always belongs to some class and there are <lb/>
            many other things in the same kind. First in the case of living <lb/>
            things, most noble Memmius, ou will find that in this sort has <lb/>
            y <lb/>
            been begotten the mountain-ranging race of wild beasts, in this <lb/>
            sort the breed of men, in this sort too the mute shoals of scaly <lb/>
            creatures and all bodies of fowls. Wherefore on a like principle <lb/>
            vou must admit that earth and sun moon sea and all things else <lb/>
            that are, are not single in their kind, but rather in number past <lb/>
            numbering; since the deep-set boundary-mark of life just as <lb/>
            much awaits these and they are just as much of a body that <lb/>
            had birth, as any class of things which here on earth abounds in <lb/>
            samples of its kind.</p>
          <p>If you well apprehend and keep in mind these things, nature <lb/>
            free at once and rid of her haughty lords is seen to do all things <lb/>
            spontaneously of herself without the meddling of the gods. For <lb/>
            I appeal to the holy breasts of the gods who in tranquil peace <lb/>
            pass a calm time and an unruffled existence, who can rule the <lb/>
            sum, who hold in his hand with controlling force the strong <lb/>
            reins, of the immeasurable deep ? who can at once make all the <lb/>
            different heavens to roll and warm with ethereal fires all the <lb/>
            fruitful earths, or be present in all places at all times, to bring <lb/>
            darkness with clouds and shake with noise the heaven's serene <lb/>
            expanse, to hurl lightnings and often throw down his own tem­ <lb/>
            ples, and withdrawing into the deserts there to spend his rage <lb/>
            in practising his bolt which often passes the guilty by and <lb/>
            strikes dead the innocent and unoffending ?</p>
          <p>And since the birth-time of the world and first day of being <lb/>
            to sea and earth and the formation of the sun many bodies have <lb/>
            been added from without, many seeds added all round, which the <lb/>
            great universe in tossing to and fro has contributed; that from <lb/>
            them the sea and lands might increase and from them heaven's <pb n="55"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="1110−1151"/> <lb/>
            mansion might enlarge its expanse and raise its high vaults far <lb/>
            above earth, and that air might rise up around. For all bodies <lb/>
            from all quarters are assigned by blows each to its appropriate <lb/>
            thing and all withdraw to their proper classes; moisture passes <lb/>
            to moisture, from an earthy body earth increases and fires forge <lb/>
            fires and ether ether, until nature parent of things with finish­ <lb/>
            ing hand has brought all things on to their utmost limit of <lb/>
            growth. And this comes to pass when that which is infused <lb/>
            into the life-arteries is no more than that which ebbs from <lb/>
            them and withdraws: at this point the life-growth in all things <lb/>
            must stop, at this point nature by her powers checks further <lb/>
            increase. For whatever things you see grow in size with joyous <lb/>
            increase and mount by successive steps to mature age, take to <lb/>
            themselves more bodies than they discharge from themselves, <lb/>
            while food is readily infused into all the arteries and the things <lb/>
            are not so widely spread out as to throw off many particles and <lb/>
            occasion more waste than their age can take in as nourishment. <lb/>
            For no doubt it must be conceded that many bodies ebb away <lb/>
            and withdraw from things; but still more must join them, until <lb/>
            they have touched the utmost point of growth. Then piece by <lb/>
            piece age breaks their powers and matured strength and wastes <lb/>
            away on the side of decay. For the larger a thing is and the <lb/>
            widei, as soon as its growth is stopped, at once it sheds abroad <lb/>
            and discharges from it more bodies in all directions round; and <lb/>
            its food is not readily transmitted into all its arteries and is not <lb/>
            enough, in proportion to the copious exhalations which the thing <lb/>
            throws off, to enable a like amount to rise up and be supplied. <lb/>
            For food must keep all things entire by renewing them, food must <lb/>
            uphold, food sustain all things: all in vain, since the arteries <lb/>
            refuse to hold what is sufficient, and nature does not furnish the <lb/>
            needful amount. With good reason therefore all things perish, <lb/>
            when they have been rarefied by the ebb of particles and suc­ <lb/>
            cumb to blows from without, since food sooner or later fails <lb/>
            advanced age, and bodies never cease to destroy a thing by <lb/>
            thumping it from without and to overpower it by aggressive <lb/>
            blows. In this way then the walls too of the great world around <lb/>
            shall be stormed and fall to decay and crumbling ruin. Yes and <lb/>
            even now the age is enfeebled and the earth exhausted by bear­ <lb/>
            ing scarce produces little living creatures, she who produced all <pb n="56"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="1152−1174"/> <lb/>
            races and gave birth to the huge bodies of wild beasts. For <lb/>
            methinks no golden chain let down to earth from heaven above <lb/>
            the races of mortal beings, nor did the sea and waves which lash <lb/>
            the rocks produce them, but the same earth bare them which <lb/>
            now feeds them out of herself. Moreover she first spontaneously <lb/>
            of herself produced for mortals goodly corn-crops and joyous <lb/>
            vineyards; of herself gave sweet fruits and glad pastures; which <lb/>
            now-a-days scarce attain any size when furthered by our labour: <lb/>
            we exhaust the oxen and the strength of the husbandmen; we <lb/>
            wear out our iron, scarcely fed after all by the tilled fields; so <lb/>
            niggardly are they of their produce and after so much labour <lb/>
            do they let it grow. And now the aged ploughman shakes his <lb/>

            his hands have come to nothing; and when he compares pre­ <lb/>
            sent times with times past, he often praises the fortunes of his <lb/>
            sire and harps on the theme, how the men of old rich in piety <lb/>
            comfortably supported life on a scanty plot of ground, since the <lb/>
            allotment of land to each man was far less of yore than now. <lb/>
            The sorrowful planter too of the exhausted and shrivelled vine <lb/>
            impeaches the march of time and wearies heaven, and compre­ <lb/>

            to the grave, quite forspent by age and length of days.</p><pb n="57"/>

          </head>
          <p>Thee, who first wast able amid such thick darkness to raise on <lb/>
            high so bright a beacon and shed a light on the true interests of <lb/>
            life, thee I follow, glory of the Greek race, and plant now my <lb/>
            footsteps firmly fixed in thy imprinted marks, not so much from <lb/>
            a desire to rival thee as that from the love I bear thee I yearn to <lb/>
            imitate thee; for why need the swallow contend with swans, or <lb/>
            what likeness is there between the feats of racing performed by <lb/>
            kids with tottering limbs and by the powerful strength of the <lb/>
            horse ? Thou, father, art discoverer of things, thou furnishest us <lb/>
            with fatherly precepts, and like as bees sip of all things in the <lb/>
            flowery lawns, we, o glorious being, in like manner feed from out <lb/>
            thy pages upon all the golden maxims, golden I say, most worthy <lb/>
            ever of endless life. For soon as thy philosophy issuing from a <lb/>
            godlike intellect has begun with loud voice to proclaim the nature <lb/>
            of things, the terrors of the mind are dispelled, the walls of the <lb/>
            world part asunder, I see things in operation throughout the <lb/>
            whole void : the divinity of the gods is revealed and their tran­ <lb/>
            quil abodes which neither winds do shake nor clouds drench <lb/>
            with rains nor snow congealed by sharp frosts harms with hoary <lb/>
            fall: an ever cloudless ether o'ercanopies them, and they laugh <lb/>
            with light shed largely round. Nature too supplies all their <lb/>
            wants and nothing ever impairs their peace of mind. But on <lb/>
            the other hand the Acherusian quarters are nowhere to be seen, <lb/>
            though earth is no bar to all things being descried, which are <lb/>
            in operation underneath our feet throughout the void. At all <lb/>
            this a kind of. godlike delight mixed with shuddering awe comes <pb n="58"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="29−74"/> <lb/>
            over me to think that nature by thy power is laid thus visibly <lb/>
            open, is thus unveiled on every side.</p>
          <p>And now since I have shewn what-like the beginnings of all <lb/>
            things arc and how diverse with varied shapes as they fly sponta­ <lb/>
            neously driven on in everlasting motion, and how all things can be <lb/>
            severally produced out of these, next after these questions the nature <lb/>
            of the mind and soul should methinks be cleared up by my verses <lb/>
            and that dread of Acheron be driven headlong forth, troubling as <lb/>
            it does the life of man from its inmost depths and overspreading <lb/>
            all things with the blackness of death, allowing no pleasure to be <lb/>
            pure and unalloyed. For as to what men often give out that <lb/>
            diseases and a life of shame are more to be feared than Tartarus <lb/>
            place of death, and that they know the soul to be of blood or <lb/>
            it may be of wind, if haply their choice so direct, and that they <lb/>
            have no need at all of our philosophy, you may perceive for the <lb/>
            following reasons that all these boasts are thrown out more for <lb/>
            glory's sake than because the thing is really believed. These <lb/>
            very men, exiles from their country and banished far from the <lb/>
            sight of men, live degraded by foul charge of guilt, sunk in a <lb/>
            word in every kind of misery, and whithersoever the poor wretches <lb/>
            are come, they yet do offer sacrifices to the dead and slaughter <lb/>
            black sheep and make libations to the gods manes and in times <lb/>
            of distress turn their thoughts to religion much more earnestly. <lb/>
            Wherefore you can better test the man in doubts and dangers and <lb/>
            mid adversity learn who he is ; for then and not till then the <lb/>
            words of truth are forced out from the bottom of his heart: the <lb/>
            mask is torn off, the reality is left. Avarice again and blind lust <lb/>
            of honours which constrain unhappy men to overstep the bounds <lb/>
            of right and sometimes as partners and agents of crimes to strive <lb/>
            night and day with surpassing effort to struggle up to the summit <lb/>
            of power,-these sores of life are in no small measure fostered by <lb/>
            the dread of death. For foul scorn and pinching want in every <lb/>
            case are seen to be far removed from a life of pleasure and se­ <lb/>
            curity and to be a loitering so to say before the gates of death. <lb/>
            And while men driven on by an unreal dread wish to escape far <lb/>
            away from these and keep them far from them, they amass wealth <lb/>
            by civil bloodshed and greedily double their riches piling up <lb/>
            murder on murder; cruelly triumph in the sad death of a <lb/>
            brother and hate and fear the tables of kinsfolk. Often like­ <pb n="59"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="74−114"/> <lb/>
            wise from the same fear envy causes them to pine: they make <lb/>
            moan that before their very eyes he is powerful, he attracts <lb/>
            attention, who walks arrayed in gorgeous dignity, while they <lb/>
            are wallowing in darkness and dirt. Some wear themselves to <lb/>
            death for the sake of statues and a name. And often to such <lb/>
            a degree through dread of death does hate of life and of the <lb/>
            sight of daylight seize upon mortals, that they commit self­ <lb/>
            murder with a sorrowing heart, quite forgetting that this fear <lb/>
            is the source of their cares, [this fear which urges men to every <lb/>
            sin], prompts this one to put all shame to rout, another to burst <lb/>
            asunder the bonds of friendship, and in fine to overturn duty <lb/>
            from its very base; since often ere now men have betrayed <lb/>
            country and dear parents in seeking to shun the Acherusian <lb/>
            quarters. For even as children are flurried and dread all things <lb/>
            in the thick darkness, thus we in the daylight fear at times <lb/>
            things not a whit more to be dreaded than what children shud­ <lb/>
            der at in the dark and fancy sure to be. This terror therefore <lb/>
            and darkness of mind must be dispelled not by the rays of the <lb/>
            sun and glittering shafts of day, but by the aspect and law of <lb/>
            nature.</p>
          <p>First then I say that the mind which we often call the un­ <lb/>
            derstanding, In which dwells the directing and governing prin­ <lb/>
            ciple of life, is no less part of the man, than hand and foot and <lb/>
            eyes are parts of the whole living creature. [Some however <lb/>
            affirm] that the sense of the mind does not dwell in a distinct <lb/>
            part, but is a certain vital state of the body, which the Greeks <lb/>
            call harmonia, because by it, they say, we live with sense, though <lb/>
            the understanding is in no one part; just as when good health <lb/>
            is said to belong to the body, though yet it is not any one part <lb/>
            of the man in health. In this way they do not assign a distinct <lb/>
            part to the sense of the mind ; in all which they appear to me <lb/>
            to be grievously at fault in more ways than one. Oftentimes the <lb/>
            body which is visible to sight, is sick, while yet we have pleasure <lb/>
            in another hidden part; and oftentimes the case is the very re­ <lb/>
            verse, the man who is unhappy in mind feeling pleasure in his <lb/>
            whole body; just as if, while a sick man's foot is pained, the head <lb/>
            meanwhile should be in no pain at all. Moreover when the limbs <lb/>
            are consigned to soft sleep and the burdened body lies diffused <lb/>
            without sense, there is yet a something else in us which during <pb n="60"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="114−156"/> <lb/>
            that time is moved in many ways and admits into it all the mo­ <lb/>
            tions of joy and unreal cares of the heart. Now that you may <lb/>
            know that the soul as well is in the limbs and that the body is <lb/>
            not wont to have sense by any harmony, this is a main proof: <lb/>
            when much of the body has been taken away, still life often stays <lb/>
            in the limbs; and yet the same life, when a few bodies of heat <lb/>
            have been dispersed abroad and some air has been forced out <lb/>
            through the mouth, abandons at once the veins and quits the <lb/>
            bones : by this you may perceive that all bodies have not func­ <lb/>
            tions of like importance nor alike uphold existence, but rather <lb/>
            that those seeds which constitute wind and heat, cause life to <lb/>
            stay in the limbs. Therefore vital heat and wind are within the <lb/>
            body and abandon our frame at death. Since then the nature <lb/>
            of the mind and that of the soul have been proved to be a part <lb/>
            as it were of the man, surrender the name of harmony, whether <lb/>
            brought down to musicians from high Helicon, or whether rather <lb/>
            they have themselves taken it from something else and transferred <lb/>
            it to that thing which then was in need of a distinctive name ; <lb/>
            whatever it be, let them keep it: do you take in the rest of my <lb/>
            precepts.</p>
          <p>Now I assert that the mind and the soul are kept together <lb/>
            in close union and make up a single nature, but that the direct­ <lb/>
            ing principle which we call mind and understanding, is the head <lb/>
            so to speak and reigns paramount in the whole body. It has a <lb/>
            fixed seat in the middle region of the breast: here throb fear and <lb/>
            apprehension, about these spots dwell soothing joys; therefore <lb/>
            here is the understanding or mind. All the rest of the soul dis­ <lb/>
            seminated through the whole body obeys and moves at the will <lb/>
            and inclination of the mind. It by itself alone knows for itself, <lb/>
            rejoices for itself, at times when the impression does not move <lb/>
            either soul or body together with it. And as when some part <lb/>
            of us, the head or the eye, suffers from an attack of pain, we do <lb/>
            not feel the anguish at the same time over the whole body, thus <lb/>
            the mind sometimes suffers pain by itself or is inspirited with joy, <lb/>
            when all the rest of the soul throughout the limbs and frame is <lb/>
            stirred by no novel sensation. But when the mind is excited by <lb/>
            some more vehement apprehension, we see the whole soul feel <lb/>
            in unison through all the limbs, sweats and paleness spread over <lb/>
            the whole body, the tongue falter, the voice die away, a mist <pb n="61"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="156−198"/> <lb/>
            cover the eyes, the ears ring, the limbs sink under one; in short <lb/>
            we often see men drop down from terror of mind; so that any­ <lb/>
            body may easily perceive from this that the soul is closely united <lb/>
            with the mind, and, when it has been smitten by the influence of <lb/>
            the mind, forthwith pushes and strikes the body.</p>
          <p>This same principle teaches that the nature of the mind and <lb/>
            soul is bodily; for when it is seen to push the limbs, rouse the <lb/>
            body from sleep, and alter the countenance and guide and turn <lb/>
            about the whole man, and when we see that none of these effects <lb/>
            can take place without touch nor touch without body, must we <lb/>
            not admit that the mind and the soul are of a bodily nature ? <lb/>
            Again you perceive that our mind in our body suffers together <lb/>
            with the body and feels in unison with it. When a weapon with <lb/>
            a shudder-causing force has been driven in and has laid bare bones <lb/>
            and sinews within the body, if it does not take life, yet there <lb/>
            ensues a faintness and a lazy sinking to the ground and on the <lb/>
            ground the turmoil of mind which arises, and sometimes a kind <lb/>
            of undecided inclination to get up. Therefore the nature of the <lb/>
            mind must be bodily, since it suffers from bodily weapons and <lb/>
            blows.</p>
          <p>I will now go on to explain in my verses of what kind of body <lb/>
            the mind consists and out of what it is formed. First of all I say <lb/>
            that it is extremely fine and formed of exceedingly minute bodies. <lb/>
            That this is so you may, if you please to attend, clearly perceive <lb/>
            from what follows: nothing that is seen takes place with a ve­ <lb/>
            locity equal to that of the mind when it starts some suggestion <lb/>
            and actually sets it agoing; the mind therefore is stirred with <lb/>
            greater rapidity than any of the things whose nature stands out <lb/>
            visible to sight. But that which is so passing nimble, must con­ <lb/>
            . sist of seeds exceedingly round and exceedingly minute, in order <lb/>
            to be stirred and set in motion by a small moving power. Thus <lb/>
            water is moved and heaves by ever so small a force, formed as it <lb/>
            is of small particles apt to roll. But on the other hand the nature <lb/>
            of honey is more sticky, its liquid more sluggish and its movement <lb/>
            more dilatory; for the whole mass of matter coheres more closely, <lb/>
            because sure enough it is made of bodies not so smooth fine and <lb/>
            round. A breeze however gentle and light can force, as you may <lb/>
            see, a high heap of poppy seed to be blown away from the top <lb/>
            downwards; but on the other hand eurus itself cannot move a <pb n="62"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="198−242"/> <lb/>
            heap of stones. Therefore bodies possess a power of moving in <lb/>
            proportion to theiv smallness and smoothness; and on the other <lb/>
            hand the greater weight and roughness bodies prove to have, the <lb/>
            more stable they are. Since then the nature of the mind has <lb/>
            been found to be eminently easy to. move, it must consist of <lb/>
            bodies exceedingly small smooth and round. The knowledge of <lb/>
            which fact, my good friend, will on many accounts prove useful <lb/>
            and be serviceable to you. The following fact too likewise demon­ <lb/>
            strates how fine the texture is of which its nature is composed, <lb/>
            and how small the room is in which it can be contained, could it <lb/>
            only be collected into one mass: soon as the untroubled sleep of <lb/>
            death has ootten hold of a man and the nature of the mind and <lb/>
            soul has withdrawn, you can perceive then no diminution of the <lb/>
            entire body either in appearance or weight: death makes all good <lb/>
            save the vital sense and heat. Therefore the whole soul must <lb/>
            consist of very small seeds and be inwoven through veins and <lb/>
            flesh and sinews ; inasmuch as, after it has all withdrawn from <lb/>
            the whole body, the exterior contour of the limbs preserves itself <lb/>
            entire and not a tittle of the weight is lost. Just in the same <lb/>
            way when the flavour of wine is gone or when the delicious aroma <lb/>
            of a perfume has been dispersed into the air or when the savour <lb/>
            has left some body, yet the thing itself does not therefore look <lb/>
            smaller to the eye, nor does aught seem to have been taken from <lb/>
            the weight, because sure enough many minute seeds make up <lb/>
            the savours and the odour in the whole body of the several <lb/>
            things. Therefore, again and again I say, you are to know that <lb/>
            the nature of the mind and the soul has been formed of exceed­ <lb/>
            ingly minute seeds, since at its departure it takes away none of <lb/>
            the weight.</p>
          <p>We are not however to suppose that this nature is single. <lb/>
            For a certain subtle spirit mixed with heat quits men at death, <lb/>
            and then the heat draws air along with it; there being no heat <lb/>
            which has not air too mixed with it: for since its nature is rare, <lb/>
            many first-beginnings of air must move about through it. Thus <lb/>
            the nature of the mind is proved to be threefold; and yet these <lb/>
            things all together are not sufficient to produce sense; since the <lb/>
            fact of the case does not admit that any of these can produce <lb/>
            sense-giving motions and the thoughts which a man turns over <lb/>
            in mind. Thus some fourth nature too must be added to these: <pb n="63"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="242−283"/> <lb/>
            it is altogether without name; than it nothing exists more nimble <lb/>
            or more fine, or of smaller or smoother elements: it first trans­ <lb/>
            mits the sense-giving motions through the frame; for it is first <lb/>
            stirred, made up as it is of small particles ; next the heat and <lb/>
            the unseen force of the spirit receive the motions, then the air; <lb/>
            then all things are set in action, the blood is stirred, every part <lb/>
            of the flesh is filled with sensation; last of all the feeling is trans­ <lb/>
            mitted to the bones and marrow, whether it be one of pleasure <lb/>
            or an opposite excitement. No pain however can lightly pierce <lb/>
            thus far nor any sharp malady make its way in, without all things <lb/>
            being so thoroughly disordered that no room is left for life and <lb/>
            the parts of the soul fly abroad through all the pores of the body. <lb/>
            But commonly a stop is put to these motions on the surface as it <lb/>
            were of the body : for this reason we are able to retain life.</p>
          <p>Now though I would fain explain in what way these are mixed <lb/>
            up together, by what means united, when they exert their powers, <lb/>
            the poverty of my native speech deters me sorely against my will: <lb/>
            yet will I touch upon them and in summary fashion to the best of <lb/>
            my ability: the first-beginnings by their mutual motions are inter­ <lb/>
            laced in such a way that none of them can be separated by itself, <lb/>
            nor can the function of any go on divided from the rest by any <lb/>
            interval; but they are so to say the several powers of one body. <lb/>
            Even so in any flesh of living creature you please without excep­ <lb/>
            tion there is smell and some colour and a savour, and yet out of all <lb/>
            these is made up one single bulk of body. Thus the heat and <lb/>
            the air and the unseen power of the spirit mixed together produce <lb/>
            a single nature, together with that nimble force which trans­ <lb/>
            mits to them from itself the origin of motion; by which means <lb/>
            sense-giving motion first takes its rise through the fleshly frame. <lb/>
            For this nature lurks secreted in its inmost depths, and nothing <lb/>
            in our body is farther beneath all ken than it, and more than this <lb/>
            it is the very soul of the whole soul. Just in the same way as the <lb/>
            power of the mind and the function of the soul are latent in our <lb/>
            limbs and throughout our body, because they are each formed of <lb/>
            small and few bodies: even so, you are to know, this nameless <lb/>
            power made of minute bodies is concealed and is moreover the <lb/>
            very soul so to say of the whole soul, and reigns supreme in the <lb/>
            whole body. On a like principle the spirit and air and heat must, <lb/>
            as they exert their powers, be mixed up together through the <pb n="64"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="284−325"/> <lb/>
            frame, and one must ever be more out of view or more prominent <lb/>
            than another, that a single substance may be seen to be formed <lb/>
            from the union of all, lest the heat and spirit apart by themselves <lb/>
            and the power of the air apart by itself should destroy sense and <lb/>
            dissipate it by their disunion. Thus the mind possesses that heat <lb/>
            which it displays when it boils up in anger and fire flashes from <lb/>
            the keen eyes; there is too much cold spirit comrade of fear, <lb/>
            which spreads a shivering over the limbs and stirs the whole <lb/>
            frame; yes and there is also that condition of still air which has <lb/>
            place when the breast is calm and the looks cheerful. But they <lb/>
            have more of the hot whose keen heart and passionate mind lightly <lb/>
            boil up in anger. Foremost in this class comes the fierce vio­ <lb/>
            lence of lions who often as they chafe break their hearts with their <lb/>
            roaring and cannot contain within their breast the billows of their <lb/>
            rage. Then the chilly mind of stags is fuller of the spirit and <lb/>
            more quickly rouses through all the flesh its icy currents which <lb/>
            cause a shivering motion to pass over the limbs. But the nature <lb/>
            of oxen has its life rather from the still air, and never does the <lb/>
            smoky torch of anger applied to it stimulate it too much, shedding <lb/>
            over it the shadow of murky gloom, nor is it transfixed and stif­ <lb/>
            fened by the icy shafts of fear: it lies between the other two, stags <lb/>
            and cruel lions. And thus it is with mankind: however much <lb/>
            teaching renders some equally refined, it yet leaves behind those <lb/>
            earliest traces of the nature of each mind ; and we are not to sup­ <lb/>
            pose that evil habits can be so thoroughly plucked up by the roots, <lb/>
            that one man shall not be more prone than another to keen anger, <lb/>
            a second shall not be somewhat more quickly assailed by fear, <lb/>
            a third shall not take some things more meekly than is right. In <lb/>
            many other points there must be differences between the varied <lb/>
            natures of men and the tempers which follow upon these; though <lb/>
            at present I am unable to set forth the hidden causes of these <lb/>
            or to find names enough for the different shapes which belong <lb/>
            to the first-beginnings, from which shapes arises this diversity of <lb/>
            things. What herein I think I may affirm is this : traces of the <lb/>
            different natures left behind, which reason is unable to expel from <lb/>
            us, are so exceedingly slight that there is nothing to hinder us <lb/>
            from living a life worthy of gods.</p>
          <p>Well this nature is contained by the whole body and is in turn <lb/>
            the body's guardian and the cause of its existence; for the two <pb n="65"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="325−365"/> <lb/>
            adhere together with common roots and cannot it is plain be riven <lb/>
            asunder without destruction. Even as it is not easy to pluck the <lb/>
            perfume out of lumps of frankincense without quite destroying its <lb/>
            nature as well; so it is not easy to withdraw from the whole body <lb/>
            the nature of the mind and soul without dissolving all alike. <lb/>
            With first-beginnings so interlaced from their earliest birth are <lb/>
            they formed and gifted with a life of joint partnership, and it is <lb/>
            plain that the faculty of the body and of the mind cannot feel <lb/>
            separately, each alone without the other's power, but sense is <lb/>
            kindled throughout our flesh and blown into flame between the <lb/>
            two by the joint motions on the part of both. Moreover the body <lb/>
            by itself is never either begotten or grows or, it is plain, continues <lb/>
            to exist after death. For not in the way that the liquid of water <lb/>
            often loses the heat which has been given to it, yet is not for <lb/>
            that reason itself riven in pieces, but remains unimpaired,-not <lb/>
            in this way, I say, can the abandoned frame endure the separation <lb/>
            of the soul, but riven in pieces it utterly perishes and rots away. <lb/>
            Thus the mutual connexions of body and soul from the first <lb/>
            moment of their existence learn the vital motions even while hid <lb/>
            in the body and womb of the mother, so that no separation can <lb/>
            take place without mischief and ruin. Thus you may see that, <lb/>
            since the cause of existence lies in their joint action, their nature <lb/>
            too must be a joint nature.</p>
          <p>Furthermore if any one tries to disprove that the body feels <lb/>
            and believes that the soul mixed through the whole body takes <lb/>
            upon it this motion which we name sense, he combats even mani­ <lb/>
            fest and undoubted facts. For who will ever bring forward any <lb/>
            explanation of what the body's feeling is, except that which the <lb/>
            plain fact of the case has itself given and taught to us ? But when <lb/>
            the soul it is said has departed, the body throughout is without <lb/>
            sense; yes, for it loses what was not its own peculiar property <lb/>
            in life; ay and much else it loses, before that soul is driven <lb/>
            out of it.</p>
          <p>Again to say that the eyes can see no object, but that the <lb/>
            soul discerns through them as through an open door, is far from <lb/>
            easy, since their sense contradicts this; for this sense e'en draws it <lb/>
            and forces it out to the pupil: nay often we are unable to perceive <lb/>
            shining things, because our eyes are embarrassed by the lights. <lb/>
            But this is not the case with doors; for, because we ourselves see, <note type="footnote"> M. III. </note> <note type="footnote"> E </note> <lb/>
            <pb n="66"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="366−404"/><lb/>
            the open doors do not therefore undergo any fatigue. Again if <lb/>
            our eyes are in the place of doors, in that case when the eyes <lb/>
            are removed the mind ought it would seem to have more power of <lb/>
            seeing things, after doors, jambs and all, have been taken out of <lb/>
            the way.</p>
          <p>And herein you must by no means adopt the opinion which <lb/>
            the revered judgment of the worthy man Democritus lays down, <lb/>
            that the first-beginnings of body and mind placed together in <lb/>
            successive layers come in alternate order and so weave the tissue <lb/>
            of our limbs. For not only are the elements of the soul much <lb/>
            smaller than those of which our body and flesh are formed, but <lb/>
            they are also much fewer in number and are disseminated merely <lb/>
            in scanty number through the frame, so that you can warrant no <lb/>
            more than this: the first-beginnings of the soul keep spaces be­ <lb/>
            tween them at least as great as are the smallest bodies which, if <lb/>
            thrown upon it, are first able to excite in our body the sense- <lb/>
            giving motions. Thus at times we do not feel the adhesion of dust <lb/>
            when it settles on our body, nor the impact of chalk when it <lb/>
            rests on our limbs, nor do we feel a mist at night nor a spider's <lb/>
            slender threads as they come against us, when we are caught in <lb/>
            its meshes in moving along, nor the same insect's flimsy web when <lb/>
            it has fallen on our head, nor the feathers of birds and down <lb/>
            of plants as it flies about, which commonly from exceeding <lb/>
            lightness does not lightly fall, nor do we feel the tread of every <lb/>
            creeping creature whatsoever nor each particular foot-print which <lb/>
            gnats and the like stamp on our body. So very many first- <lb/>
            beginnings must be stirred in us, before the seeds of the soul <lb/>
            mixed up in our bodies feel that these have been disturbed, and <lb/>
            by thumping with such spaces between can clash unite and in <lb/>
            turn recoil.</p>
          <p>The mind has more to do with holding the fastnesses of life <lb/>
            and has more sovereign sway over it than the power of the soul. <lb/>
            For without the understanding and the mind no part of the soul <lb/>
            can maintain itself in the frame the smallest fraction of time, but <lb/>
            follows at once in the other's train and passes away into the air <lb/>
            and leaves the cold limbs in the chill of death. But he abides in <lb/>
            life whose mind and understanding continue to stay with him: <lb/>
            though the trunk is mangled with its limbs shorn all round about <lb/>
            it, after the soul has been taken away on all sides and been <pb n="67"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="404−445"/> <lb/>
            severed from the limbs the trunk yet lives and inhales the <lb/>
            ethereal airs of life. When robbed, if not of the whole, yet of a <lb/>
            large portion of the soul, it still lingers in and cleaves to life; just <lb/>
            as, after the eye has been lacerated all round if the pupil has <lb/>
            continued uninjured, the living power of sight remains, provided <lb/>
            always you do not destroy the whole ball of the eye and pare close <lb/>
            round the pupil and leave only it; for that will not be done even <lb/>
            to the ball without the entire destruction of the eye. But if that <lb/>
            middle portion of the eye, small as it is, is eaten into, the sight is <lb/>
            gone at once and darkness ensues, though a man have the bright <lb/>
            ball quite unimpaired. On such terms of union soul and mind are <lb/>
            ever bound to each other.</p>
          <p>Now mark me: that you may know that the minds and <lb/>
            light souls of living creatures have birth and are mortal, I will <lb/>
            go on to set forth verses worthy of your attention, got together <lb/>
            by long study and invented with welcome effort. Do you mind <lb/>
            to link to one name both of them alike, and when for instance <lb/>
            I shall choose to speak of the soul, shewing it to be mortal, <lb/>
            believe that I speak of the mind as well, inasmuch as both <lb/>
            make up one thing and are one united substance. First of all <lb/>
            then since I have shewn the soul to be fine and to be formed of <lb/>
            minute bodies and made up of much smaller first-beginnings <lb/>
            than is the liquid of water or mist or smoke :-for it far sur­ <lb/>
            passes these in nimbleness and is moved, when struck by a far <lb/>
            slenderer cause; inasmuch as it is moved by images of smoke <lb/>
            and mist; as when for instance sunk in sleep we see altars steam <lb/>
            forth their heat and send up their smoke on high; for beyond <lb/>
            a doubt images are begotten for us from these things :-well <lb/>
            then since you see on the vessels being shattered the water flow <lb/>
            away on all sides, and since mist and smoke pass away into air, <lb/>
            believe that the soul too is shed abroad and perishes much more <lb/>
            quickly and dissolves sooner into its first bodies, when once it <lb/>
            has been taken out of the limbs of a man and has withdrawn. <lb/>
            For, when the body that serves for its vessel cannot hold it, <lb/>
            if shattered from any cause and rarefied by the withdrawal of <lb/>
            blood from the veins, how can you believe that this soul can <lb/>
            be held by any air? how can that air which is rarer than our <lb/>
            body hold it in ?</p>
          <p>Again we perceive that the mind is begotten along with <note type="footnote"> E 2 </note> <lb/>
            <pb n="68"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="445−487"/><lb/>
            the body and grows up together with it and becomes old along <lb/>
            with it. For even as children go about with a tottering and <lb/>
            weakly body, so slender sagacity of mind follows along with it; <lb/>
            then when their life has reached the maturity of confirmed <lb/>
            strength, the judgment too is greater and the power of the mind <lb/>
            more developed. Afterwards when the body has been shattered <lb/>
            by the mastering might of time and the frame has drooped <lb/>
            with its forces dulled, then the intellect halts, the tongue dotes, <lb/>
            the mind gives way, all faculties fail and are found wanting at <lb/>
            the same time. It naturally follows then that the whole nature <lb/>
            of the soul is dissolved, like smoke, into the high air; since we <lb/>
            see it is begotten along with the body and grows up along with <lb/>
            it and, as I have shewn, breaks down at the same time worn <lb/>
            out with age.</p>
          <p>Moreover we see that even as the body is liable to violent <lb/>
            diseases and severe pain, so is the mind to sharp cares and grief <lb/>
            and fear; it naturally follows therefore that it is its partner in <lb/>
            death as well. Again in diseases of the body the mind often <lb/>
            wanders and goes astray; for it loses its reason and drivels in <lb/>
            its speech and often in a profound lethargy is carried into deep <lb/>
            and never-ending sleep with drooping eyes and head; out of <lb/>
            which it neither hears the voices nor can recognise the faces of <lb/>
            those who stand round calling it back to life and bedewing with <lb/>
            tears face and cheeks. Therefore you must admit that the <lb/>
            mind too dissolves, since the infection of disease reaches to it; <lb/>
            for pain and disease are both forgers of death: a truth we have <lb/>
            fully learned ere now by the death of many. Again, when the <lb/>
            pungent strength of wine has entered into a man and its spirit <lb/>
            has been infused into and transmitted through his veins, why <lb/>
            is it that a heaviness of the limbs follows along with this, his <lb/>
            legs are hampered as he reels about, his tongue falters, his <lb/>
            mind is besotted, his eyes swim, shouting hiccuping wranglings <lb/>
            are rife, together with all the other usual concomitants, why is <lb/>
            all this, if not because the overpowering violence of the wine <lb/>
            is wont to disorder the soul within the body ? But whenever <lb/>
            things can be disordered and hampered, they give token that if <lb/>
            a somewhat more potent cause gained an entrance, they would <lb/>
            perish and be robbed of all further existence. Moreover it often <lb/>
            happens that some one constrained by the violence of disease <pb n="69"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="488−528"/> <lb/>
            suddenly drops down before our eyes, as by a stroke of light­ <lb/>
            ning, and foams at the mouth, moans and shivers through his <lb/>
            frame, loses his reason, stiffens his muscles, is racked, gasps for <lb/>
            breath fitfully, and wearies his limbs with tossing. Sure enough, <lb/>
            because the violence of the disease spreads itself through his <lb/>
            frame and disorders him, he foams as he tries to eject his soul, <lb/>
            just as in the salt sea the waters boil with the mastering might <lb/>
            of the winds. A moan too is forced out, because the limbs are <lb/>
            seized with pain, and mainly because seeds of voice are driven <lb/>
            forth and are carried in a close mass out by the mouth, the road <lb/>
            which they are accustomed to take and where they have a well­ <lb/>
            paved way. Loss of reason follows, because the powers of the <lb/>
            mind and soul are disordered and, as I have shewn, are riven and <lb/>
            forced asunder, torn to pieces by the same baneful malady. Then <lb/>
            after the cause of the disease has bent its course back and the <lb/>
            acrid humours of the distempered body return to their hiding- <lb/>
            places, then he first gets up like one reeling, and by little and <lb/>
            little comes back into full possession of his senses and regains <lb/>
            his soul. Since therefore even within the body mind and soul <lb/>
            are harassed by such violent distempers and so miserably racked <lb/>
            by sufferings, why believe that they without the body in the open <lb/>
            air can continue existence battling with fierce winds ? And since <lb/>
            we perceive that the mind is healed like the sick body, and <lb/>
            we see that it can be altered by medicine, this too gives warn­ <lb/>
            ing that the mind has a mortal existence. For it is natural that <lb/>
            whosoever essays and attempts to change the mind or seeks to <lb/>
            alter any other nature you like, should add new parts or change <lb/>
            the arrangement of the present, or withdraw In short some tittle <lb/>
            from the sum. But that which is immortal wills not to have <lb/>
            its parts transposed nor any addition to be made nor one tittle <lb/>
            to ebb away; for whenever a thing changes and quits its proper <lb/>
            limits, this change is at once the death of that which was be­ <lb/>
            fore. Therefore the mind, whether it is sick or whether it is <lb/>
            altered by medicine, alike, as I have shewn, gives forth mortal <lb/>
            symptoms. So invariably is truth found to make head against <lb/>
            false reason and to cut off all retreat from the assailant and by <lb/>
            a two-fold refutation to put falsehood to rout.</p>
          <p>Again we often see a man pass gradually away and limb by <lb/>
            limb lose vital sense; first the toes of his feet and the nails <pb n="70"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="528−568"/> <lb/>
            turn livid, then the feet and shanks die, then next the steps of <lb/>
            chilly death creep with, slow pace over the other members. There­ <lb/>
            fore since the nature of the soul is rent and passes away and <lb/>
            does not at one time stand forth in its entireness, it must <lb/>
            be reckoned mortal. But if haply you suppose that it can <lb/>
            draw itself in through the whole frame and mass its parts to­ <lb/>
            gether and in this way withdraw sense from all the limbs, yet <lb/>
            then that spot into which so great a store of soul is gathered, <lb/>
            ought to shew itself in possession of a greater amount of sense. <lb/>
            But as this is nowhere found, sure enough as we said before, it <lb/>
            is torn in pieces and scattered abroad, and therefore dies. More­ <lb/>
            over if I were pleased for the moment to grant what is false <lb/>
            and admit that the soul might be collected in one mass in the <lb/>
            body of those who leave the light dying piecemeal, even then <lb/>
            you must admit the soul to be mortal; and it makes no differ­ <lb/>
            ence whether it perish dispersed in air, or gathered into one <lb/>
            lump out of all its parts lose all feeling, since sense ever more <lb/>
            and more fails the whole man throughout and less and less of <lb/>
            life remains throughout.</p>
          <p>And since the mind is one part of a man which remains <lb/>
            fixed in a particular spot, just as are the ears and eyes and the <lb/>
            other senses which guide and direct life; and just as the hand <lb/>
            or eye or nose when separated from us cannot feel and exist <lb/>
            apart, but in however short a time wastes away in putrefaction, <lb/>
            thus the mind cannot exist by itself without the body and the <lb/>
            man's self which as you see serves for the mind's vessel or any <lb/>
            thing else you choose to imagine which implies a yet closer <lb/>
            union with it, since the body is attached to it by the nearest <lb/>
            ties.</p>
          <p>Again the quickened powers of body and mind by their <lb/>
            joint partnership enjoy health and life; for the nature of the <lb/>
            mind cannot by itself alone without the body give forth vital <lb/>
            motions nor can the body again bereft of the soul continue to <lb/>
            exist and make use of its senses: just, you are to know, as the <lb/>
            eye itself torn away from its roots cannot see anything when <lb/>
            apart from the whole body, thus the soul and mind cannot it is <lb/>
            plain do anything by themselves. Sure enough, because mixed <lb/>
            up through veins and flesh, sinews and bones, their first-begin­ <lb/>
            nings are confined by all the body and are not free to bound <pb n="71"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="568−608"/> <lb/>
            away leaving great spaces between, therefore thus shut in they <lb/>
            make those sense-giving motions which they cannot make after <lb/>
            death when forced out of the body into the air by reason that <lb/>
            they are not then confined in a like manner; for the air will be <lb/>
            a body and a living thing, if the soul shall be able to keep <lb/>
            itself together and to enclose in it those motions which it used <lb/>
            before to perform in the sinews and within the body. Moreover <lb/>
            even while it yet moves within the confines of life, often the <lb/>
            soul shaken from some cause or other is seen to wish to pass <lb/>
            out and be loosed from the whole body, the features are seen <lb/>
            to droop as at the last hour and all the limbs to sink flaccid <lb/>
            over the bloodless trunk: just as happens, when the phrase is <lb/>
            used, the mind is in a bad way, or the soul is quite gone; <lb/>
            when all is hurry and every one is anxious to keep from parting <lb/>
            the last tie of life; for then the mind and the power of the soul <lb/>
            are shaken throughout and both are quite loosened together <lb/>
            with the body; so that a cause somewhat more powerful can <lb/>
            quite break them up. Why doubt I would ask that the soul <lb/>
            when driven forth out of the body, when in the open air, feeble <lb/>
            as it is, stript of its covering, not only cannot continue through <lb/>
            eternity, but is unable to hold together the smallest fraction of <lb/>
            time ? Therefore, again and again I say, when the enveloping <lb/>
            body has been all broken up and the vital airs have been forced <lb/>
            out, you must admit that the senses of the mind and the soul are <lb/>
            dissolved, since the cause of destruction is one and inseparable for <lb/>
            both body and soul.</p>
          <p>Again since the body is unable to bear the separation of the <lb/>
            soul without rotting away in a noisome stench, why doubt that <lb/>
            the power of the soul gathering itself up from the inmost depths <lb/>
            of body has oozed out and dispersed like smoke, and that the <lb/>
            crumbling body has changed and tumbled in with so total a <lb/>
            ruin for this reason because its foundations throughout are stirred <lb/>
            from their places, the soul oozing out abroad through the frame, <lb/>
            through all the winding passages which are in the body, and all <lb/>
            openings ? so that in ways manifold you may learn that the <lb/>
            nature of the soul has been divided piecemeal and gone forth <lb/>
            throughout the frame, and that it has been torn to shreds within <lb/>
            the body, ere it glided forth and swam out into the air. For no <lb/>
            one when dying appears to feel the soul go forth entire from his <pb n="72"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="608−649"/> <lb/>
            whole body or first mount up to the throat and gullet, but all <lb/>
            feel it fail in that part which lies in a. particular quarter; just <lb/>
            as they know that the senses as well suffer dissolution each in its <lb/>
            own place. But if our mind were immortal, it would not when <lb/>
            dying complain so much of its dissolution, as of passing abroad <lb/>
            and quitting its vesture, like a snake.</p>
          <p>Again why are the mind's understanding and judgment never <lb/>
            begotten in the head or feet or hands, but cling in all alike to one <lb/>
            spot and fixed quarter, if it be not that particular places arc <lb/>
            assigned for the birth of everything, and [nature has determined] <lb/>
            where each is to continue to exist after it is born? [Our body <lb/>
            then must follow the same law] and have such a manifold organi­ <lb/>
            sation of parts, that no perverted arrangement of its members <lb/>
            shall ever shew itself: so invariably effect follows cause, nor is <lb/>
            flame wont to be born in rivers nor cold in fire.</p>
          <p>Again if the nature of the soul is immortal and can feel when <lb/>
            separated from our body, methinks we must suppose it to be pro­ <lb/>
            vided with five senses; and in no other way can we picture to <lb/>
            ourselves souls below flitting about Acheron. Painters therefore <lb/>
            and former generations of writers have thus represented souls <lb/>
            provided with senses. But neither eyes nor nose nor hand can <lb/>
            exist for the soul apart from the body nor can tongue, nor can <lb/>
            ears perceive by the sense of hearing or exist for the soul by <lb/>
            themselves apart from the body.</p>
          <p>And since we perceive that vital sense is in the whole body <lb/>
            and we see that it is all endowed with life, if on a sudden any <lb/>
            force with swift blow shall have cut it in twain so as quite to <lb/>
            dissever the two halves, the power of the soul will without doubt <lb/>
            at the same time be cleft and cut asunder and dashed in twain <lb/>
            together with the body. But that which is cut and divides into <lb/>
            any parts, you are to know disclaims for itself an everlasting <lb/>
            nature. Stories are told how scythed chariots reeking with in­ <lb/>
            discriminate slaughter often lop off limbs so instantaneously that <lb/>
            that which has fallen down lopped off from the frame is seen to <lb/>
            quiver on the ground, while yet the mind and faculty of the man <lb/>
            from the suddenness of the mischief cannot feel the pain; and <lb/>
            because his mind once for all is wholly given to the business of <lb/>
            fighting, with what remains of his body he mingles in the fray <lb/>
            and carnage, and often perceives not that the wheels and de­ <pb n="73"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="649−691"/> <lb/>
            vouring scythes have carried off among the horses' feet his left <lb/>
            arm shield and all; another sees not that his right arm has <lb/>
            dropped from him, while he mounts and presses forward. An­ <lb/>
            other tries to get up after he has lost his leg, while the dying foot <lb/>
            quivers with its toes on the ground close by. The head too when <lb/>
            cut off from the warm and living trunk retains on the ground the <lb/>
            expression of life and open eyes, until it has yielded up all the <lb/>
            remnants of soul. To take another case, if, as a serpent's tongue <lb/>
            is quivering, as its tail is darting out from its long body, you <lb/>
            choose to chop with an axe into many pieces both [tail and body], <lb/>
            you will see all the separate portions thus cut off writhing under <lb/>
            the fresh wound and bespattering the earth with gore, the fore <lb/>
            part with the mouth making for its own hinder part, to allay with <lb/>
            burning bite the pain of the wound with which it has been smit­ <lb/>
            ten. Shall we say then that there are entire souls in all those <lb/>
            pieces ? why from that argument it will follow that one living <lb/>
            creature had many souls in its body; and this being absurd, <lb/>
            therefore the soul which was one has been divided together with <lb/>
            the body; therefore each alike must be reckoned mortal, since <lb/>
            each is alike chopped up into many pieces.</p>
          <p>Again if the nature of the soul is immortal and makes its <lb/>
            way into our body at the time of birth, why are we unable to <lb/>
            remember besides the time already gone, and why do we retain <lb/>
            no traces of past actions ? If the power of the mind has been so <lb/>
            completely changed, that all remembrance of past things is lost, <lb/>
            that methinks differs not widely from death; therefore you must <lb/>
            admit that the soul which was before has perished and that which <lb/>
            now is has now been formed.</p>
          <p>Again if the quickened power of the mind is wont to be put <lb/>
            into us after our body is fully formed, at the instant of our birth <lb/>
            and our crossing the threshold of life, it ought agreeably to this <lb/>
            to live not in such a way as to seem to have grown with the body <lb/>
            and together with its members within the blood, but as in a den <lb/>
            apart by and to itself: the very contrary to what undoubted fact <lb/>
            teaches; for it is so closely united with the body throughout the <lb/>
            veins flesh sinews and bones, that the very teeth have a share of <lb/>
            sense; as their aching proves and the sharp twinge of cold water <lb/>
            and the crunching of a rough stone, when it has got into them <lb/>
            out of bread. Wherefore, again and again I say, we must believe <pb n="74"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="691−733"/> <lb/>
            souls to be neither without a birth nor exempted from the law of <lb/>
            death; for we must not believe that they could have been so <lb/>
            completely united with our bodies, if they found their way into <lb/>
            them from without, nor, since they are so closely inwoven with <lb/>
            them, does it appear that they can get out unharmed and unloose <lb/>
            themselves unscathed from all the sinews and bones and joints. <lb/>
            But if haply you believe that the soul finds its way in from <lb/>
            without and is wont to ooze through all our limbs, so much the <lb/>
            more it will perish thus blended with the body; for what oozes <lb/>
            through another is dissolved, and therefore dies. As food dis­ <lb/>
            tributed through all the cavities of the body, while it is trans­ <lb/>
            mitted into the limbs and the whole frame, is destroyed and <lb/>
            furnishes out of itself the matter of another nature, thus the soul <lb/>
            and mind, though they pass entire into a fresh body, yet in oozing <lb/>
            through it are dissolved, whilst there are transmitted so to say <lb/>
            into the frame through all the cavities those particles of which <lb/>
            this nature of mind is formed, which now is sovereign in our body, <lb/>
            being born out of that soul which then perished when dispersed <lb/>
            through the frame. Wherefore the nature of the soul is seen to <lb/>
            be neither without a birthday nor exempt from death.</p>
          <p>Again are seeds of the soul left in the dead body or not ? If <lb/>
            they are left and remain in it, the soul cannot fairly be deemed <lb/>
            immortal, since it has withdrawn lessened by the loss of some <lb/>
            parts ; but if when taken away from the yet untainted limbs it <lb/>
            has fled so entirely away as to leave in the body no parts of <lb/>
            itself, whence do carcases exude worms from the now rank flesh <lb/>
            and whence does such a swarm of living things, boneless and <lb/>
            bloodless, surge through the heaving frame ? But if haply you <lb/>
            believe that souls find their way into worms from without and <lb/>
            can severally pass each into a body and you make no account <lb/>
            of why many thousands of souls meet together in a place from <lb/>
            which one has withdrawn, this question at least must, it seems, be <lb/>
            raised and brought to a decisive test, whether souls hunt out <lb/>
            the several seeds of worms and build for themselves a place to <lb/>
            dwell in, or find their way into bodies fully formed so to say. <lb/>
            But why they should on their part make a body or take such <lb/>
            trouble, cannot be explained; since being without a body they <lb/>
            are not plagued as they flit about with diseases and cold and <lb/>
            hunger, the body being more akin to, more troubled by such <pb n="75"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="733−774"/> <lb/>
            infirmities, and by its contact with it the mind suffering many <lb/>
            ills. Nevertheless be it ever so expedient for them to make <lb/>
            a body, when they are going to enter, yet clearly there is no <lb/>
            way by which they can do so. Therefore souls do not make for <lb/>
            themselves bodies and limbs; no nor can they by any method <lb/>
            find their way into bodies after they are fully formed; for they <lb/>
            will neither be able to unite themselves with a nice precision <lb/>
            nor will any connexion of mutual sensation be formed between <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>Again why does untamed fierceness go along with the sullen <lb/>
            brood of lions, cunning with foxes and proneness to flight with <lb/>
            stags ? and to take any other instance of the kind, why are all <lb/>
            qualities engendered in the limbs and temper from the very com­ <lb/>
            mencement of life, if not because a fixed power of mind derived <lb/>
            from its proper seed and breed grows up together with the whole <lb/>
            body? If it were immortal and wont to pass into different bodies, <lb/>
            living creatures would be of interchangeable dispositions ; a dog <lb/>
            of Hyrcanian breed would often fly before the attack of an antlered <lb/>
            stag, a hawk would cower in mid air as it fled at the approach of <lb/>
            a dove, men would be without reason, the savage races of wild <lb/>
            beasts would have reason. For the assertion that an immortal <lb/>
            soul is altered by a change of body is advanced on a false prin­ <lb/>
            ciple. What is changed is dissolved, and therefore dies: the <lb/>
            parts are transposed and quit their former order; therefore <lb/>
            they must admit of being dissolved too throughout the frame, in <lb/>
            order at last to die one and all together with the body. But <lb/>
            if they shall say that souls of men always go into human bodies, <lb/>
            I yet will ask how it is a soul can change from wise to foolish, <lb/>
            and no child has discretion, and why the mare's foal is not so <lb/>
            well trained as the powerful strength of the horse. You may <lb/>
            be sure they will fly to the subterfuge that the mind grows <lb/>
            weakly in a weakly body. But granting this is so, you must <lb/>
            admit the soul to be mortal, since changed so completely through­ <lb/>
            out the frame it loses its former life and sense. Then too in <lb/>
            what way will it be able to grow in strength uniformly with its <lb/>
            allotted body and reach the coveted flower of age, unless it shall <lb/>
            be its partner at its first beginning ? or what means it by passing <lb/>
            out from the limbs when decayed with age ? does it fear to re­ <lb/>
            main shut up in a crumbling body, fear that its tenement, worn <pb n="76"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="774−826"/> <lb/>
            out by protracted length of days, bury it in its ruins? Why an <lb/>
            immortal being incurs no risks.</p>
          <p>Again for souls to stand by at the unions of Venus and the <lb/>
            birth-throes of beasts seems to be passing absurd, for them the <lb/>
            immortals to wait for mortal limbs in number numberless and <lb/>
            struggle with one another in forward rivalry, which shall first and <lb/>
            by preference have entrance in; unless haply bargains are struck <lb/>
            among the souls on these terms, that whichever in its flight shall <lb/>
            first come up, shall first have right of entry, and that they shall <lb/>
            make no trial at all of each other's strength.</p>
          <p>Again a tree cannot exist in the ether, nor clouds in the deep <lb/>
            sea nor can fishes live in the fields nor blood exist in woods nor <lb/>
            sap in stones. Where each thing can grow and abide is fixed and <lb/>
            ordained. Thus the nature of the mind cannot come into being <lb/>
            alone without the body nor exist far away from the sinews and <lb/>
            blood. But if (for this would be much more likely to happen than <lb/>
            that) the force itself of the mind might be in the head or shoul­ <lb/>
            ders or heels or might be born in any other part of the body, it <lb/>
            would after all be wont to abide in one and the same man or <lb/>
            vessel. But since in our body even it is fixed and seen to be <lb/>
            ordained where the soul and the mind can severally be and grow, <lb/>
            it must still more strenuously be denied that it can abide and be <lb/>
            born out of the body altogether. Therefore when the body has <lb/>
            died, we must admit that the soul has perished, wrenched away <lb/>
            throughout the body. To link forsooth a mortal thing with an <lb/>
            everlasting and suppose that they can have sense in common and <lb/>
            can be reciprocally acted upon, is sheer folly; for what can be <lb/>
            conceived more incongruous, more discordant and inconsistent <lb/>
            with itself, than a thing which is mortal, linked with an immortal <lb/>
            and everlasting thing, trying in such union to weather furious <lb/>
            storms ? But if haply the soul is to be accounted immortal for <lb/>
            this reason rather, because it is kept sheltered from death-bring­ <lb/>
            ing things, either because things hostile to its existence do not <lb/>
            approach at all, or because those which do approach, in some <lb/>
            way or other retreat discomfited before we can feel the harm <lb/>
            they do, [manifest experience proves that this can not be true]. <lb/>
            For besides that it sickens in sympathy with the maladies of the <lb/>
            body, it is often attacked by that which frets it on the score <lb/>
            of the future and keeps it on the rack of suspense and wears <lb/>
            <pb n="77"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="826−866"/><lb/>
            it out with cares; and when ill deeds are in the past, remorse for <lb/>
            sins yet gnaws: then there is madness peculiar to the mind and <lb/>
            forgetfulness of all things; then too it often sinks into the black <lb/>
            waters of lethargy.</p>
          <p>Death therefore to us is nothing, concerns us not a jot, since <lb/>
            the nature of the mind is proved to be mortal; and as in time <lb/>
            gone by we felt no distress, when the Poeni from all sides came <lb/>
            together to do battle, and all things shaken by war's troublous <lb/>
            uproar shuddered and quaked beneath high heaven, and mortal <lb/>
            men were in doubt which of the two peoples it should be to <lb/>
            whose empire all must fall by sea and land alike, thus when we <lb/>
            shall be no more, when there shall have been a separation of <lb/>
            body and soul, out of both of which we are each formed into a <lb/>
            single being, to us, you may be sure, who then shall be no <lb/>
            more, nothing whatever can happen to excite sensation, not if <lb/>
            earth shall be mingled with sea and sea with heaven. And <lb/>
            even supposing the nature of the mind and power of the soul do <lb/>
            feel, after they have been severed from our body, yet that is <lb/>
            nothing to us who by the binding tie of marriage between body <lb/>
            and soul are formed each into one single being. And if time <lb/>
            should gather up our matter after our death and put it once <lb/>
            more into the position in which it now is, and the light of life <lb/>
            be given to us again, this result even would concern us not <lb/>
            at all, when the chain of our self-consciousness has once been <lb/>
            snapped asunder. So now we give ourselves no concern about any <lb/>
            self which we have been before, nor do we feel any distress on <lb/>
            the score of that self. For when you look back on the whole <lb/>
            past course of immeasurable time and think how manifold are <lb/>
            the shapes which the motions of matter take, you may easily <lb/>
            credit this too, that these very same seeds of which we now are <lb/>
            formed, have often before been placed in the same order in <lb/>
            which they now are; and yet we cannot recover this in memory: <lb/>
            a break in our existence has been interposed, and all the motions <lb/>
            have wandered to and fro far astray from the sensations they <lb/>
            produced. For he whom evil is to befal, must in his own person <lb/>
            exist at the very time it comes, if the misery and suffering are <lb/>
            haply to have any place at all; but since death precludes this, <lb/>
            and forbids him to be, upon whom the ills can be brought, you <lb/>
            may be sure that we have nothing to fear after death, and <lb/>
            <pb n="78"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="867−903"/><lb/>
            that he who exists not, cannot become miserable, and that it <lb/>
            matters not a whit whether he has been born into life at any <lb/>
            other time, when immortal death has taken away his mortal life.</p>
          <p>Therefore when yon see a man bemoaning his hard case, <lb/>
            that after death he shall either rot with his body laid in the <lb/>
            grave or be devoured by flames or the jaws of wild beasts, yon <lb/>
            may be sure that his ring betrays a flaw and that there lurks in <lb/>
            his heart a secret goad, though he himself declare that he does <lb/>
            not believe that any sense will remain to him after death. He <lb/>
            does not methinks really grant the conclusion which he pro­ <lb/>
            fesses to grant nor the principle on which he so professes, nor <lb/>
            does he take and force himself root and branch out of life, but <lb/>
            all unconsciously imagines something of self to survive. For <lb/>
            when any one in life suggests to himself that birds and beasts <lb/>
            will rend his body after death, he makes moan for himself: he <lb/>
            does not separate himself from that self, nor withdraw himself <lb/>
            fully from the body so thrown out, and fancies himself that <lb/>
            other self and stands by and impregnates it with his own sense. <lb/>
            Hence he makes much moan that he has been born mortal, and <lb/>
            sees not that after real death there will be no other self to re­ <lb/>
            main in life and lament to self that his own self has met death, <lb/>
            and there to stand and grieve that his own self there lying is <lb/>
            mangled or burnt. For if it is an evil after death to be pulled <lb/>
            about by the devouring jaws of wild beasts, I cannot see why <lb/>
            it should not be a cruel pain to be laid on fires and burn in <lb/>
            hot flames, or to be placed in honey and stifled, or to stiffen <lb/>
            with cold, stretched on the smooth surface of an icy slab of <lb/>
            stone, or to be pressed down and crushed by a load of earth <lb/>
            above.</p>
          <p>'Now no more shall thy house admit thee with glad wel­ <lb/>
            come, nor a most virtuous wife and sweet children run to be <lb/>
            the first to snatch kisses and touch thy heart with a silent joy. <lb/>
            No more mayst thou be prosperous in thy doings, a safeguard <lb/>
            to thine own. One disastrous day has taken from thee luckless <lb/>
            man in luckless wise all the many prizes of life'. This do men <lb/>
            say; but add not thereto ' and now no longer does any craving <lb/>
            for these things beset thee withal'. For if they could rightly <lb/>
            perceive this in thought and follow up the thought in words, <lb/>
            they would release themselves from great distress and appre­ <pb n="79"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="903−942"/> <lb/>
            hension of mind. 'Thou, even as now thou art, sunk in the <lb/>
            sleep of death, shalt continue so to be all time to come, freed <lb/>
            from all distressful pains; but we with a sorrow that would not <lb/>
            be sated wept for thee, when close by thou didst turn to an <lb/>
            ashen hue on thy appalling funeral pile, and no length of days <lb/>
            shall pluck from our hearts our ever-during grief. This question <lb/>
            therefore should be asked of this speaker, what there is in it so <lb/>
            passing bitter, if it come in the end to sleep and rest, that any <lb/>
            one should pine in never-ending sorrow.</p>
          <p>This too men often, when they have reclined at table cup <lb/>
            in hand and shade their brows with crowns, love to say from <lb/>
            the heart, ' short is this enjoyment for poor weak men; pre­ <lb/>
            sently it will have been and never after may it be called back'. <lb/>
            As if after their death it is to be one of their chiefest afflictions <lb/>
            that thirst and parching drought is to burn them up hapless <lb/>
            wretches, or a craving for any thing else is to beset them. <lb/>
            What folly! no one feels the want of himself and life at the <lb/>
            time when mind and body are together sunk in sleep; for all <lb/>
            we care this sleep might be everlasting, no craving whatever <lb/>
            for ourselves then moves us. And yet by no means do those <lb/>
            first-beginnings throughout our frame wander at that time far <lb/>
            away from their sense-producing motions, at the moment when <lb/>
            a man starts up from sleep and collects himself. Death therefore <lb/>
            must be thought to concern us much less, if less there can be <lb/>
            than what we see to be nothing; for a greater dispersion of the <lb/>
            mass of matter follows after death, and no one wakes up, upon <lb/>
            whom the chill cessation of life has once come.</p>
          <p>Once more, if the nature of things could suddenly utter a <lb/>
            voice and in person could rally any of us in such words as these <lb/>
            ' what hast thou, 0 mortal, so much at heart, that thou goest <lb/>
            such lengths in sickly sorrows ? why bemoan and bewail death ? <lb/>
            for say thy life past and gone has been welcome to thee and thy <lb/>
            blessings have not all, as if they were poured into a perforated <lb/>
            vessel, run through and been lost without avail: why not then <lb/>
            take thy departure like a guest filled with life, and with resig­ <lb/>
            nation, thou fool, enter upon untroubled rest ? but if all that <lb/>
            thou hast enjoyed, has been squandered and lost, and life is a <lb/>
            grievance, why seek to make any addition, to be wasted per­ <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="943−980"/> <lb/>
            rather make an end of life and travail ? for there is nothing <lb/>
            more which I can contrive and discover for thee to give plea­ <lb/>
            sure : all things are ever the same. Though thy body is not <lb/>
            yet decayed with years nor thy frame worn out and exhausted, <lb/>
            yet all things remain the same, ay though in length of life thou <lb/>
            shouldst outlast all races of things now living, nay even more <lb/>
            if thou shouldst never die', what answer have we to make save <lb/>
            this, that nature sets up against us a well-founded claim and <lb/>
            puts forth in her pleading a true indictment ? If however one of <lb/>
            greater age and more advanced in years should complain and <lb/>
            lament poor wretch his death more than is right, would she <lb/>
            not with greater cause raise her voice and rally him in sharp <lb/>
            accents, ' away from this time forth with thy tears, rascal; a <lb/>
            truce to thy complainings: thou decayest after full enjoyment. <lb/>
            of all the prizes of life. But because thou ever yearnest for <lb/>
            what is not present, and despisest what is, life has slipped from <lb/>
            thy grasp unfinished and unsatisfying, and or ever thou thought­ <lb/>
            est, death has taken his stand at thy pillow, before thou canst <lb/>
            take thy departure sated and filled with good things. Now how­ <lb/>
            ever resign all things unsuited to thy age, and with a good <lb/>
            grace up and greatly go: thou must'. With good reason me­ <lb/>
            thinks she would bring her charge, with reason rally and re­ <lb/>
            proach ; for old things give way and are supplanted by new <lb/>
            without fail, and one thing must ever be replenished out of other <lb/>
            things; and no one is delivered over to the pit and black Tar­ <lb/>
            tarus : matter is needed for after generations to grow; all of <lb/>
            which though will follow thee when they have finished their term <lb/>
            of life; and thus it is that all these no less than thou have before <lb/>
            this come to an end and hereafter will come to an end. Thus one <lb/>
            thing will never cease to rise out of another, and life is granted to <lb/>
            none in fee-simple, to all in usufruct. Think too how the bygone <lb/>
            antiquity of everlasting time before our birth was nothing to us. <lb/>
            Nature therefore holds this up to us as a mirror of the time yet to <lb/>
            come after our death. Is there aught in this that looks appalling, <lb/>
            aught that wears an aspect of gloom ? is it not more untroubled <lb/>
            than any sleep ?</p>
          <p>And those things sure enough, which are fabled to be in the <lb/>
            deep of Acheron, do all exist for us in this life. No Tan­ <lb/>
            talus, numbed by groundless terror, as the story is, fears poor <pb n="81"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="980−1023"/><lb/>
            wretch a huge stone hanging in air; but in life rather a base­ <lb/>
            less dread of the gods vexes mortals: the fall they fear is such <lb/>
            fall of luck as chance brings to each. Nor do birds eat a way <lb/>
            into Tityos laid in Acheron, nor can they sooth to say find <lb/>
            during eternity food to peck under his large breast. However <lb/>
            huge the bulk of body he extends, though such as to take up <lb/>
            with outspread limbs not nine acres merely, but the whole <lb/>
            earth, yet will he not be able to endure everlasting pain and <lb/>
            supply food from his own body for ever. But he is for us a <lb/>
            Tityos, whom as he grovels in love vultures rend and bitter <lb/>
            bitter anguish eats up or troubled thoughts from any other pas­ <lb/>
            sion do rive. In life too we have a Sisyphus before our eyes <lb/>
            who is bent on asking from the people the rods and cruel axes, <lb/>
            and always retires defeated and disappointed. For to ask for <lb/>
            power, which empty as it is is never given, and always in the <lb/>
            chase of it to undergo severe toil, this is forcing up-hill with <lb/>
            much effort a stone which after all rolls back again from the <lb/>
            summit and seeks in headlong haste the levels of the plain. <lb/>
            Then to be ever feeding the thankless nature of the mind, and <lb/>
            never to fill it full and sate it with good things, as the seasons <lb/>
            of the year do for us, when they come round and bring their <lb/>
            fruits and varied delights, though after all we are never filled <lb/>
            with the enjoyments of life, this methinks is to do what is told <lb/>
            of the maidens in the flower of their age, to keep pouring water <lb/>
            into a perforated vessel which in spite of all can never be filled <lb/>
            full. Moreover Cerberus and the furies and yon privation of <lb/>
            light [are idle tales, as well as all the rest, Ixion's wheel and <lb/>
            black] Tartarus belching forth hideous fires from his throat: <lb/>
            things which nowhere are nor sooth to say can be. But there <lb/>
            is in life a dread of punishment for evil deeds, signal as the <lb/>
            deeds are signal, and for atonement of guilt, the prison and the <lb/>
            frightful hurling down from the rock, scourgings, executioners, <lb/>
            the dungeon of the doomed, the pitch, the metal plate, torches; <lb/>
            and even though these are wanting, yet the conscience-stricken <lb/>
            mind through boding fears applies to itself goads and frightens <lb/>
            itself with whips, and sees not meanwhile what end there can <lb/>
            be of ills or what limit at last is to be set to punishments, and <lb/>
            fears lest these very evils be enhanced after death. The life of <lb/>
            fools at length becomes a hell here on earth. <note type="footnote"> M. III. </note> <note type="footnote"> F </note> <pb n="82"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="1024−1063"/>This too you may sometimes say to yourself, 'even worthy <lb/>
            Ancus has quitted the light with his eyes, who was far far better <lb/>
            than thou, unconscionable man. And since then many other <lb/>
            kings and kesars have been laid low, who lorded it over mighty <lb/>
            nations. He too, even he who erst paved a way over the great <lb/>
            sea and made a path for his legions to march over the deep and <lb/>
            taught them to pass on 'foot over the salt pools and set at <lb/>
            naught the roarings of the sea, trampling on them with his <lb/>
            horses, had the light taken from him and shed forth his soul <lb/>
            from his dying body. The son of the Scipios, thunderbolt of <lb/>
            war, terror of Carthage, yielded his bones to earth just as if he <lb/>
            were the lowest menial. Think too of the inventors of all <lb/>
            sciences and graceful arts, think of the companions of the Heli­ <lb/>
            conian maids; among whom Homer bore the sceptre without a <lb/>
            peer, and he now sleeps the same sleep as others. Then there <lb/>
            is Democritus who, when a ripe old age had warned him that <lb/>
            the memory-waking motions of his mind were waning, by his <lb/>
            own spontaneous act offered up his head to death. Even Epicurus <lb/>
            passed away, when his light of life had run its course, he who <lb/>
            surpassed in intellect the race of man and quenched the light of <lb/>
            all, as the ethereal sun arisen quenches the stars. Wilt thou <lb/>
            then hesitate and think it a hardship to die ? thou for whom life <lb/>
            is well nigh dead whilst yet thou livest and seest the light, who <lb/>
            spendest the greater part of thy time in sleep and snorest wide <lb/>
            awake and ceasest not to see visions and hast a mind troubled <lb/>
            with groundless terror and canst not discover often what it is <lb/>
            that ails thee, when besotted man thou art sore pressed on all <lb/>
            sides with full many cares and goest astray tumbling about in <lb/>
            the wayward wanderings of thy mind.</p>
          <p>If, just as they are seen to feel that a load is on their mind <lb/>
            which wears them out with its pressure, men might apprehend <lb/>
            from what causes too it is produced and whence such a pile, if I <lb/>
            may say so, of ill lies on their breast, they would not spend their <lb/>
            life as we see them now for the most part do, not knowing any <lb/>
            one of them what he means and wanting ever change of place <lb/>
            as though he might lay his burden down. The man who is sick <lb/>
            of home often issues forth from his large mansion, and as sud­ <lb/>
            denly comes back to it, finding as he does that he is no better <lb/>
            off abroad. He races to his country-house, driving his jennets <pb n="83"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="1063−1094"/> <lb/>
            in headlong haste, as if hurrying to bring help to a house on <lb/>
            fire: he yawns the moment he has reached the door of his <lb/>
            house, or sinks heavily into sleep and seeks forgetfulness, or <lb/>
            even in haste goes back again to town. In this way each man <lb/>
            flies from himself, (but self from whom, as you may be sure is <lb/>
            commonly the case, he cannot escape, clings to him in his own <lb/>
            despit-e) hates too himself, because he is sick and knows not the <lb/>
            cause of the malady; for if he could rightly see into this, relin­ <lb/>
            quishing all else each man would study to learn the nature of <lb/>
            things, since the point at stake is the condition for eternity, not <lb/>
            for one hour, in which mortals have to pass all the time which <lb/>
            remains for them to expect after death.</p>
          <p>Once more what evil lust of life is this which constrains us <lb/>
            with such force to be so mightily troubled in doubts and dangers ? <lb/>
            a sure term of life is fixed for mortals, and death cannot be <lb/>
            shunned, but meet it we must. Moreover we are ever engaged, <lb/>
            ever involved in the same pursuits, and no new pleasure is <lb/>
            struck out by living on; but whilst what we crave is wanting, <lb/>
            it seems to transcend all the rest; then, when it has been got­ <lb/>
            ten, we crave something else, and ever does the same thirst of <lb/>
            life possess us, as we gape for it open-mouthed. Quite doubtful <lb/>
            it is what fortune the future will carry with it or what chance <lb/>
            will bring us or what end is at hand. Nor by prolonging life <lb/>
            do we take one tittle from the time past in death nor can we <lb/>
            fret anything away, whereby we may haply be a less long time <lb/>
            in'the condition of the dead. Therefore you may complete as <lb/>
            many generations as you please during your life; none the less <lb/>
            however will that everlasting death await you; and for no less <lb/>
            long a time will he be no more in being, who beginning with to­ <lb/>
            day has ended his life, than the mail who has died many months <lb/>
            and years ago. <note type="footnote"> F 2 </note> <pb n="84"/>

          <p>I traverse the pathless haunts of the Pierides never yet trodden <lb/>
            by sole of man. I love to approach the untasted springs and <lb/>
            to quaff, I love to cull fresh flowers and gather for my head <lb/>
            a distinguished crown from spots whence the muses have yet <lb/>
            veiled the brows of none; first because I teach of great things <lb/>
            and essay to release the mind from the fast bonds of religious <lb/>
            scruples, and next because on a dark subject I pen such lucid <lb/>
            verses overlaying all with the muses' charm. For that too would <lb/>
            seem to be not without good grounds: even as physicians when <lb/>
            they propose to give nauseous wormwood to children, first smear <lb/>
            the rim round the bowl with the sweet yellow juice of honey, <lb/>
            that the unthinking age of children may be fooled as far as <lb/>
            the lips, and meanwhile drink up the bitter draught of worm­ <lb/>
            wood and though beguiled yet not be betrayed, but rather by <lb/>
            such means recover health and strength: so I now, since this <lb/>
            doctrine seems generally somewhat bitter to those by whom it <lb/>
            has not been handled, and the multitude shrinks back from it <lb/>
            in dismay, have resolved to set forth to you our doctrine in <lb/>
            sweet-toned Pierian verse and o'erlay it as it were with the <lb/>
            pleasant honey of the muses, if haply by such means I might <lb/>
            engage your mind on my verses, till such time as you apprehend <lb/>
            all the nature of things and thoroughly feel what use it has.</p>
          <p>And now that I have taught what the nature of the mind is <lb/>
            and out of what things it is formed into one quickened being <lb/>
            with the body, and how it is dissevered and returns into its first- <lb/>
            beginnings, I will attempt to lay before you a truth which most <pb n="85"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="29−77"/> <lb/>
            nearly concerns these questions, the existence of things which <lb/>
            we call idols of things: these, like films peeled off from the <lb/>
            surface of things, fly to and fro through the air, and do likewise <lb/>
            frighten our minds when they present themselves to us awake <lb/>
            as well as in sleep, what time we behold strange shapes and <lb/>
            idols of the light-bereaved, which have often startled us in ap­ <lb/>
            palling wise as we lay relaxed in sleep: this I will essay, that <lb/>
            we may not haply believe that souls break loose from Acheron <lb/>
            or that shades fly about among the living or that something of us <lb/>
            is left behind after death, when the body and the nature of the <lb/>
            mind destroyed together have taken their departure into their <lb/>
            several first-beginnings.</p>
          <p>I say then that pictures of things and thin shapes are emitted <lb/>
            from things off their surface, to which an image serves as a kind <lb/>
            of film, or name it if you like a rind, because such image bears <lb/>
            an appearance and form like to the thing whatever it is from <lb/>
            whose body it is shed and wanders forth. This you may learn <lb/>
            however dull of apprehension from what follows. First of all <lb/>
            since among things open to sight many emit bodies, some in a <lb/>
            state of loose diffusion, like smoke which logs of oak, heat which <lb/>
            fires emit; some of a closer and denser texture, like the gossamer <lb/>
            coats which at times cicades doff in summer, and the films which <lb/>
            calves at their birth cast from the surface of their body, as well as <lb/>
            the vesture which the slippery serpent puts off among the thorns; <lb/>
            for often we see the brambles enriched with their flying spoils : <lb/>
            since these cases occur, a thin image likewise must be emitted <lb/>
            from things off their surface. For why those films should drop <lb/>
            off and withdraw from things rather than films which are really <lb/>
            thin, not one tittle of proof can be given; especially since there <lb/>
            are on the surface of things many minute bodies which may be <lb/>
            discharged in the same order they had before and preserve the <lb/>
            outline of the shape, and be discharged with far more velocity, <lb/>
            inasmuch as they are less liable to get hampered being few in <lb/>
            number and stationed in the front rank. For without doubt we <lb/>
            see many things discharge and freely give not only from the core <lb/>
            and centre, as we said before, but from their surfaces, besides <lb/>
            other things colour itself. And this is commonly done by yellow <lb/>
            and red and dark-blue awnings, when they are spread over large <lb/>
            theatres and flutter and wave as they stretch across their poles <pb n="86"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="77−121"/><lb/>
            and crossbeams; for then they dye the seated assemblage below <lb/>
            and all the show of the stage and the richly attired company of <lb/>
            the fathers, and compel them to dance about in their colour. <lb/>
            And the more these objects are shut in all round by the walls <lb/>
            of the theatre, the more do all of them within laugh on all hands, <lb/>
            o'erlaid with graceful hues, the light of day being narrowed. <lb/>
            Therefore since sheets of canvass emit colour from their surface, <lb/>
            all things will naturally emit thin pictures too, since in each case <lb/>
            alike they discharge from the surface. There are therefore as now <lb/>
            shewn sure outlines of shapes, which fly all about possessed of an <lb/>
            exquisitely small thickness and cannot when separate be seen one <lb/>
            at a time. - Again all smell smoke heat and other such-like things <lb/>
            O <lb/>
            stream off things in a state of diffusion, because while they are <lb/>
            coming from the depths of the body having arisen within it, they <lb/>
            are torn in their winding passage, and there are no straight ori­ <lb/>
            fices to the paths, for them to make their way out by in a mass. <lb/>
            But on the other hand when a thin film of surface colour is <lb/>
            discharged, there is nothing to rend it, since it is ready to hand <lb/>
            stationed in front rank. Lastly in the case of all idols which <lb/>
            shew themselves to us in mirrors, in water or any other shining <lb/>
            object, since their outsides are possessed of an appearance like <lb/>
            to the things they represent, they must be formed of emitted <lb/>
            images of things. There are therefore thin shapes and pictures <lb/>
            like to the things, which, though no one can see them one at <lb/>
            a time, yet when thrown off by constant and repeated reflexion <lb/>
            give back a visible image from the surface of mirrors; and in no <lb/>
            other way it would seem can they be kept so entire that shapes <lb/>
            are given back so exceedingly like each object.</p>
          <p>Now mark, and learn how thin the nature of an image is. <lb/>
            And first of all, since the first-beginnings are so far below the <lb/>
            ken of our senses and much smaller than the things which our <lb/>
            eyes first begin to be unable to see, to strengthen yet more the <lb/>
            proof of this also, learn in a few words how minutely fine are <lb/>
            the beginnings of all things. First, living things are in some <lb/>
            cases so very little, that their third part cannot be seen at all. <lb/>
            Of what size are we to suppose any gut of such creatures to be ? <lb/>
            or the ball of the heart or the eyes ? the limbs ? or any part <lb/>
            of the frame ? how small they must be! And then further the <lb/>
            several first-beginnings of which their soul and the nature of <pb n="87"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="121−161"/> <lb/>
            their mind must be formed ? do you not perceive how fine, how <lb/>
            minute they are ? Again in the case of all things which exhale <lb/>
            from their body a pungent smell, all-heal, nauseous wormwood, <lb/>
            strong-scented southernwood and the bitter centauries, any one of <lb/>
            which, if you happen to [feel it] lightly between two [fingers, will <lb/>
            impregnate them with a strong smell] * * but rather you are to <lb/>
            know that idols of things wander about many in number in many <lb/>
            ways, of no force, powerless to excite sense.</p>
          <p>But lest haply you suppose that only those idols of things <lb/>
            which go off from things and no others wander about, there are <lb/>
            likewise those which are spontaneously begotten and are formed <lb/>
            by themselves in this lower heaven which is called air: these <lb/>
            fashioned in many ways are borne along on high and being in a <lb/>
            fluid state cease not to alter their appearance and change it into <lb/>
            the outline of shapes of every possible kind ; as we see clouds <lb/>
            sometimes gather into masses on high and blot the calm clear <lb/>
            face of heaven, fanning the air with their motion. Thus often the <lb/>
            faces of giants are seen to fly along and draw after them a far­ <lb/>
            spreading shadow; sometimes great mountains and rocks torn <lb/>
            from the mountains are seen to go in advance and pass across the <lb/>
            sun; and then some huge beast is observed to draw with it and <lb/>
            bring on the other storm-clouds.</p>
          <p>Now [I will proceed to shew] with what ease and celerity they <lb/>
            are begotten and how incessantly they flow and fall away from <lb/>
            things. The outermost surface is ever streaming off from things <lb/>
            and admits of being discharged: when this reaches some things, <lb/>
            it passes through them, glass especially. But when it reaches <lb/>
            rough stones or the matter of wood, it is then so torn that it <lb/>
            cannot give back any idol. But when objects at once shining and <lb/>
            dense have been put in its way, a mirror especially, none of these <lb/>
            results has place: it can neither pass through it, like glass, nor <lb/>
            can it be torn either; such perfect safety the polished surface <lb/>
            minds to ensure. In consequence of this idols stream back to us <lb/>
            from such objects; and however suddenly at any moment you <lb/>
            place any thing opposite a mirror, an image shews itself: hence <lb/>
            you may be sure that thin textures and thin shapes of things in­ <lb/>
            cessantly stream from their surface. Therefore many idols are <lb/>
            begotten in a short time, so that the birth of such things is with <lb/>
            good reason named a rapid one. And as the sun must send forth <pb n="88"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="161−200"/> <lb/>
            many rays of light in a short time in order that all things may be <lb/>
            continually filled with it, so also for a like reason there must be <lb/>
            carried away from things in a moment of time idols of things <lb/>
            many in number in many ways in all directions round; since to <lb/>
            whatever part of them we present a mirror before their surfaces, <lb/>
            other things correspond to these in the mirror of a like shape and <lb/>
            like colour. Moreover though the state of heaven has just before <lb/>
            been of unsullied purity, with exceeding suddenness it becomes so <lb/>
            hideously overcast, that you might imagine all its darkness had <lb/>
            abandoned Acheron throughout and filled up the great vaults of <lb/>
            heaven: in such numbers do faces of black horror rise up from <lb/>
            amid the frightful night of storm clouds and hang over us on high. <lb/>
            Now there is no one who can tell how small a fraction of these an <lb/>
            image is, or express that sum in language.</p>
          <p>Now mark: how swift the motion is with which idols are <lb/>
            borne along, and what velocity is assigned to them as they glide <lb/>
            through the air, so that but a short hour is spent on a journey <lb/>
            through long space, whatever the spot towards which they go <lb/>
            with a movement of varied tendency, all this I will tell in <lb/>
            sweetly worded rather than in many verses; as the short song <lb/>
            of the swan is better than the loud noise of cranes scattered <lb/>
            abroad amid the ethereal clouds of the south. First of all we <lb/>
            may very often observe that things which are light and made of <lb/>
            minute bodies are swift. Of this kind are the light of the <lb/>
            sun and its heat, because they are made of minute first things <lb/>
            which are knocked forward so to speak and do not hesitate to <lb/>
            pass through the space of air between, ever driven on by a <lb/>
            blow following behind; for light on the instant is supplied by <lb/>
            fresh light and brightness goaded to shew its brightness in what <lb/>
            you might call an ever on-moving team. Therefore in like <lb/>
            manner idols must be able to scour in a moment of time through <lb/>
            space unspeakable, first because they are exceeding small and <lb/>
            there is a cause at their back to carry and impel them far for­ <lb/>
            ward ; where moreover they move on with such winged light­ <lb/>
            ness; next because when emitted they are possessed of so rare <lb/>
            a texture, that they can readily pass through any things and <lb/>
            stream as it were through the space of air between. Again if <lb/>
            those minute bodies of things which are given out from the <lb/>
            inmost depths of these things, as the light and heat of the sun, <pb n="89"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="201−242"/> <lb/>
            are seen in a moment of time to glide and spread themselves <lb/>
            through the length and breadth of heaven, fly over sea and <lb/>
            lands and flood the heaven, what then of those which stand <lb/>
            ready posted in front rank, when they are discharged and <lb/>
            nothing obstructs their egress ? how much faster, you see, and <lb/>
            farther must they travel, scouring through many times the <lb/>
            same amount of space in the same time that the sunlight takes <lb/>
            to spread over heaven! This too appears to be an eminently <lb/>
            true proof of the velocity with which idols of things are borne <lb/>
            along: as soon as ever the brightness of water is set down <lb/>
            in the open air, if the heaven is starry, in a moment the clear <lb/>
            radiant constellations of ether imaged in the water correspond <lb/>
            to those in the heaven. Now do you see in what a moment of <lb/>
            time an image drops down from the borders of heaven to the <lb/>
            borders of earth ? Therefore again and again I repeat you <lb/>
            must admit that bodies capable of striking the eyes and of pro­ <lb/>
            yoking vision [constantly travel]. with a marvellous [velocity]. <lb/>
            Smells too incessantly stream from certain things; as does cold <lb/>
            from rivers, heat from the sun, spray from the waves of the sea, <lb/>
            that eater into walls near the shore. Various sounds also cease <lb/>
            not to fly through the air. Then too a moist salt flavour often <lb/>
            comes into the mouth, when we are moving about beside the <lb/>
            sea; and when we look on at the mixing of a decoction of <lb/>
            wormwood, its bitterness affects us. In such a constant stream <lb/>
            from all things the several qualities are carried and are trans­ <lb/>
            mitted in all directions round, and no delay, no respite in the <lb/>
            flow is ever granted, since we constantly have feeling, and may at <lb/>
            any time see smell and hear the sound of anything.</p>
          <p>Again since a particular figure felt by the hands in the dark <lb/>
            is known to be the same which is seen in the bright light of <lb/>
            day, touch and sight must be excited by a quite similar cause. <lb/>
            Well then if we handle a square thing and it excites our atten­ <lb/>
            tion in the dark, in the daylight what square thing will be <lb/>
            able to fall on our sight, except the image of that thing ? <lb/>
            Therefore the cause of seeing it is plain lies in images and <lb/>
            no thing can be perceived without them. Well the idols of <lb/>
            things I speak of are borne along all round and are discharged <lb/>
            and transmitted in all directions; but because we can see with <lb/>
            the eyes alone, the consequence is that, to whatever point <pb n="90"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="242−284"/> <lb/>
            we turn our sight, there all the several things meet and strike <lb/>
            it with their shape and colour. And the image gives the power <lb/>
            to see and the means to distinguish how far each thing is <lb/>
            distant from us; for as soon as ever it is discharged, it pushes <lb/>
            before it and impels all the air which lies between it and the <lb/>
            eyes; and thus that air all streams through our eyes and <lb/>
            brushes so to say the pupils and so passes through. The con­ <lb/>
            sequence is that we see how far distant each thing is. And the <lb/>
            greater the quantity of air which is driven on before it and the <lb/>
            larger the current which brushes our eyes, the more distant <lb/>
            each different thing is seen to be. You must know these pro­ <lb/>
            cesses go on with extreme rapidity, so that at one and the same <lb/>
            moment we see what like a thing is and how far distant it is. <lb/>
            And this must by no means be deemed strange herein that, <lb/>
            while the idols which strike the eyes cannot be seen one at <lb/>
            a time, the things themselves are seen. For thus when the <lb/>
            wind too beats us with successive strokes and when piercing <lb/>
            cold streams, we are not wont to feel each single particle of that <lb/>
            wind and cold, but rather the whole result; and then we per­ <lb/>
            ceive blows take effect on our body just as if something or <lb/>
            other were beating it and giving us a sensation of its body out­ <lb/>
            side. Again when we thump a stone with a finger, we touch <lb/>
            merely the outermost colour on the surface of the stone, and <lb/>
            yet we do not feel that colour by our touch, but rather we feel <lb/>
            the very hardness of the stone seated in its inmost depths.</p>
          <p>Now mark, and learn why the image is seen beyond the <lb/>
            mirror; for without doubt it is seen withdrawn far within. The <lb/>
            case is just the same as with things which are viewed in their <lb/>
            reality beyond a door, when it offers through it an unobstructed <lb/>
            prospect and lets many things outside be seen from a house. <lb/>
            That vision too is effected by two separate airs: first there is <lb/>
            an air seen in such a case inside the doorway; next come the <lb/>
            leaves of the door right and left; next a light outside brushes <lb/>
            the eyes, then a second air, then those things outside which are <lb/>
            viewed in their reality. Thus when the image of the mirror has <lb/>
            first discharged itself, in coming to our sight it pushes forward <lb/>
            and impels all the air which lies between it and the eyes, and <lb/>
            enables us to see the whole of it before the mirror. But when we <lb/>
            have perceived the mirror as well, at once the image which is <pb n="91"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="284−324"/> <lb/>
            conveyed from us reaches the mirror and then is reflected and <lb/>
            comes back to our eyes, and drives on and rolls in front of it a <lb/>
            second air and lets us see this before itself, and for this reason it <lb/>
            looks so far withdrawn from the mirror. Wherefore again and <lb/>
            again I repeat there is no cause at all to wonder why the images <lb/>
            give back the reflexion from the surface of mirrors in the spot <lb/>
            they do, since in both the given cases the result is produced by <lb/>
            two airs. To proceed, the right side of our body is seen in <lb/>
            mirrors to be on the left, because when the image comes and <lb/>
            strikes on the plane of the mirror, it is not turned back unaltered, <lb/>
            but is beaten out in a right line backwards, just as if you were <lb/>
            to take a plaster mask before it is dry and dash it on a pillar or <lb/>
            beam, and it forthwith were to preserve the lines of its features <lb/>
            undistorted in front and were to strike out an exact copy of itself <lb/>
            straight backwards. The result will be that the eye which was <lb/>
            right will now be left; and conversely the left become the right. <lb/>
            An image may also be so transmitted from one mirror to another <lb/>
            that five or six idols are often produced. And thus all the things <lb/>
            which lurk in the inmost corners of a house, however far they <lb/>
            are withdrawn into tortuous recesses, may yet be all brought out <lb/>
            through winding passages by the aid of a number of mirrors <lb/>
            and be seen to be in the house. So unfailingly does the image <lb/>
            reflect itself from mirror to mirror; and when the left side is pre­ <lb/>
            sented, it becomes the right in the new image; then it is changed <lb/>
            back again and turns round to what it was. Moreover all little <lb/>
            sides of mirrors which possess a curvature resembling our side, <lb/>
            send back to us idols with their right corresponding to our right <lb/>
            either for this reason, because the image is transmitted from one <lb/>
            mirror to another, and then after it has been twice struck out <lb/>
            flies to us, or else because the image, when it has come to the <lb/>
            mirror, wheels about, because the curved shape of the mirror <lb/>
            teaches it to turn round and face us. Again you would think <lb/>
            that idols step out and put down their foot at the same time with <lb/>
            us and mimic our action, because from before whatever part of a <lb/>
            mirror you move away, from that part forthwith no idols can <lb/>
            be reflected; since nature constrains all things, when they are <lb/>
            carried back and recoil from things, to be given back at angles <lb/>
            equal to those at which they impinged.</p>
          <p>Bright things again the eyes eschew and shun to look upon: <pb n="92"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="325−371"/> <lb/>
            the sun even blinds them, if you persist in turning them towards <lb/>
            it, because its power is great and idols are borne through the clear <lb/>
            air with great downward force from on high, and strike the eyes <lb/>
            and disorder their fastenings. Moreover any vivid brightness often <lb/>
            burns the eyes, because it contains many seeds of fire which make <lb/>
            a way in and beget pain in the eyes. Again whatever the jaun­ <lb/>
            diced look at, becomes a greenish-yellow, because many seeds of <lb/>
            greenish-yellow stream from their body and meet the idols of <lb/>
            things, and many too are mixed up in their eyes, and these by <lb/>
            their infection tinge all things with sallow hues. Again we see <lb/>
            out of the dark things which are in the light for this reason: when <lb/>
            the black air of darkness being the nearer has first entered and <lb/>
            taken possession of the open eyes, the bright white air follows <lb/>
            straightway after and cleanses them so to say and dispels the <lb/>
            black shadows of the other air; for this is a great deal more nim­ <lb/>
            ble, a great deal more subtle and more efficacious. As soon as <lb/>
            it has filled with light and opened up the passages of the eyes <lb/>
            which the black air had before blocked up, forthwith the idols <lb/>
            of things which are situated in the light follow and excite them <lb/>
            so that we see. This we cannot do conversely in the dark out of <lb/>
            the light, because the grosser air of darkness follows behind and <lb/>
            quite fills all the openings and blocks up the passages of the eyes, <lb/>
            not letting the idols of any things at all be thrown into the eyes <lb/>
            to move them. Again when we descry far off the square towers <lb/>
            of a town, they often appear to be round for this reason: all the <lb/>
            angles are seen from a distance to look obtuse, or rather are not <lb/>
            seen at all, and their blow is lost and their stroke never makes its <lb/>
            way to our sight, because while the idols are borne on through <lb/>
            much air, the air by repeated collisions blunts the stroke perforce. <lb/>
            When in this way all the angles have together eluded the sense, <lb/>
            the stone structures are rounded off as if by the lathe; yet they <lb/>
            do not look like the things which are close before us and really <lb/>
            round, but somewhat resembling them as in shadowy outline. <lb/>
            Our shadow likewise seems to move in the sunshine and to fol­ <lb/>
            low our steps and mimic our action; if you think forsooth that <lb/>
            air deprived of life can step, imitating the motions and the actions <lb/>
            of men; for that which we are wont to term shadow can be no­ <lb/>
            thing but air devoid of light. Sure enough because the earth in <lb/>
            certain spots successively is deprived of light wherever we inter­ <pb n="93"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="372−413"/> <lb/>
            cept it in moving about, while that part of it which we have quit­ <lb/>
            ted is filled with light, therefore that which was the shadow of <lb/>
            our body, seems to have always followed us unchanged in a direct <lb/>
            line with us. For new rays of light ever pour in and the old are <lb/>
            lost, just as if wool were drawn into the fire. Therefore the earth <lb/>
            is readily stripped of light, and again filled, and cleanses itself from <lb/>
            black shadows.</p>
          <p>And yet in all this we do not admit that the eyes are cheated <lb/>
            one whit. For it is their province to observe in what spot soever <lb/>
            light and shade are; but whether the lights are still the same or <lb/>
            not, and whether it is the same shadow which was in this spot <lb/>
            that is now passing to that, or whether what we said a little <lb/>
            before is not rather the fact, this the reason of the mind, and <lb/>
            only it, has to determine; nor can the eyes know the nature of <lb/>
            things. Do not then fasten upon the eyes this frailty of the <lb/>
            mind. The ship in which we are sailing, moves on while seeming <lb/>
            to stand still; that one which remains at its moorings, is believed <lb/>
            to be passing by. The hills and fields seem to be dropping astern, <lb/>
            past which we are driving our ship and flying under sail. The <lb/>
            stars all seem to be at rest fast fixed to the ethereal vaults, and yet <lb/>
            are all in constant motion, since they rise and then go back to their <lb/>
            far-off places of setting, after they have traversed the length of <lb/>
            heaven with their bright bodies. In like manner sun and moon <lb/>
            seem to stay in one place, bodies which simple fact proves are <lb/>
            carried on. And though between mountains rising up afar off <lb/>
            from amid the waters there opens out for fleets a free passage of <lb/>
            wide extent, yet a single island seems to be formed out of them <lb/>
            united into one. When children have stopped turning round <lb/>
            themselves, the halls appear to them to whirl about and the <lb/>
            pillars to course round to such a degree, that they can scarce <lb/>
            believe that the whole roof is not threatening to tumble down <lb/>
            upon them. Again when nature begins to raise on high the <lb/>
            sun's beam ruddy with bickering fires and to lift it up above the <lb/>
            mountains, those hills above which the sun then seems to you <lb/>
            to be, as blazing close at hand he dyes them with his own fire, <lb/>
            are distant from us scarce two thousand arrow-flights, yea often <lb/>
            scarce five hundred casts of a javelin; and yet between them and <lb/>
            the sun lie immense levels of sea, spread out below the huge <lb/>
            borders of ether, and many thousands of lands are between, held <pb n="94"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="413−454"/> <lb/>
            by divers peoples and races of wild beasts. Then a puddle of <lb/>
            water not more than a finger-breadth deep, which stands between <lb/>
            the stones in the streets, offers a prospect beneath the earth of a <lb/>
            reach as vast, as that with which the high yawning maw of heaven <lb/>
            opens out above the earth; so that you seem to discern clouds and <lb/>
            see the bodies of birds far withdrawn into that wondrous sky <lb/>
            beneath the earth. Again when our stout horse has stuck in the <lb/>
            middle of a river and we have looked down on the swift waters of <lb/>
            the stream, some force seems to carry athwart the current the <lb/>
            body of the horse which is standing still and to force it rapidly <lb/>
            up the stream; and to whatever point we cast our eyes about, all <lb/>
            things seem-to be carried on and to be flowing in the same way as <lb/>
            we are. Again although a portico runs in parallel lines from one <lb/>
            end to the other and stands supported by equal columns along its <lb/>
            whole extent, yet when from the top of it it is seen in its entire <lb/>
            length, it gradually forms the contracted top of a narrowing cone, <lb/>
            until uniting roof with floor and all the right side with the left it <lb/>
            has brought them together into the vanishing point of a cone. <lb/>
            To sailors on the sea the sun appears to rise out of the waters and <lb/>
            in the waters to set and bury his light; just because they behold <lb/>
            nothing but water and sky; that you may not lightly suppose the <lb/>
            credit of the senses to be shaken on all hands. Then to people <lb/>
            unacquainted with the sea ships in harbour seem to be all askew <lb/>
            and with poop-fittings broken to be pressing up against the water. <lb/>
            For whatever part of the oars is raised above the salt water, <lb/>
            is straight, and the rudders in their upper half are straight: the <lb/>
            parts which are sunk below the water-level, appear to be broken <lb/>
            and bent round and to slope up and turn back towards the sur­ <lb/>
            face and to be so much twisted back as wellnigh to float on the <lb/>
            top of the water. And when the winds carry the thinly scattered <lb/>
            clouds across heaven in the night-time, then do the glittering <lb/>
            signs appear to glide athwart the rack and to be travelling on high <lb/>
            in a direction quite different to their real course. Then if our <lb/>
            hand chance to be placed beneath one eye and press it below, <lb/>
            through a certain sensation all things which we look at appear <lb/>
            then to become double as we look; the light of lamps brilliant <lb/>
            with flames to be double, double too the furniture through the <lb/>
            whole house, double men's faces and men's bodies. Again when <lb/>
            sleep has chained down our limbs in sweet slumber and the whole <pb n="95"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="454−495"/> <lb/>
            body is sunk in profound repose, yet then we seem to ourselves to <lb/>
            be awake and to be moving our limbs, and mid the thick dark­ <lb/>
            ness of night we think we see the sun and the daylight; and <lb/>
            though in a confined room, we seem to be passing to new climates <lb/>
            seas rivers and mountains and to be crossing plains on foot and to <lb/>
            hear noises, though the austere silence of night prevails all round, <lb/>
            and to be uttering speech though quite silent. Many are the <lb/>
            other marvels of this sort we see, which all seek to shake as it <lb/>
            were the credit of the senses: quite in vain, since the greatest <lb/>
            part of these cases cheats us on account of the mental suppositions <lb/>
            which we add of ourselves, taking those things as seen which have <lb/>
            not been seen by the senses. For nothing is harder than to sepa­ <lb/>
            rate manifest - facts from doubtful which straightway the mind <lb/>
            adds on of itself.</p>
          <p>Again if a man believe that nothing is known, he knows <lb/>
            not whether this even can be known, since he admits he knows <lb/>
            nothing. I will therefore decline to argue the case against him <lb/>
            who places himself with head where his feet should be. And <lb/>
            yet granting that he knows this, I would still put this question, <lb/>
            since he has never yet seen any truth in things, whence he knows <lb/>
            what knowing and not knowing severally are, and what it is <lb/>
            that has produced the knowledge of the true and the false and <lb/>
            what has proved the doubtful to differ from the certain. You <lb/>
            will find that from the senses first has proceeded the knowledge <lb/>
            of the true and that the senses cannot be refuted. For that <lb/>
            which is of itself to be able to refute things false by true things <lb/>
            must from the nature of the case be proved to have the higher <lb/>
            certainty. Well then what must fairly be accounted of higher <lb/>
            certainty than sense ? Shall reason founded on false sense be <lb/>
            able to contradict them, wholly founded as it is on the senses ? <lb/>
            and if they are not true, then all reason as well is rendered false. <lb/>
            Or shall the ears be able to take the eyes to task, or the touch the <lb/>
            ears ? Again shall the taste call in question this touch, or the <lb/>
            nostrils refute or the eyes controvert it ? Not so, I guess; for <lb/>
            each apart has its own distinct office, each its own power; and <lb/>
            therefore we must perceive what is soft and cold or hot by one <lb/>
            distinct faculty, by another perceive the different colours of things <lb/>
            and thus see all objects which are conjoined with colour. Taste <lb/>
            too has its faculty apart; smells spring from one source, sounds <pb n="96"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="495−536"/> <lb/>
            from another. It must follow therefore that any one sense cannot <lb/>
            confute any other. No nor can any sense take itself to task, <lb/>
            since equal credit must be assigned to it at all times. What <lb/>
            therefore has at any time appeared true to each sense, is true. <lb/>
            And if reason shall be unable to explain away the cause why <lb/>
            things which close at hand were square, at a distance looked <lb/>
            round, it yet is better, if you are at a loss for the reason, to state <lb/>
            erroneously the causes of each shape, than to let slip from your <lb/>
            grasp on any side things manifest and ruin the groundwork of <lb/>
            belief and wrench up all the foundations on which rest life and <lb/>
            existence. For not only would all reason give way, life itself <lb/>
            would at once fall to the ground, unless you choose to trust the <lb/>
            senses and shun precipices and all things else of this sort that are <lb/>
            to be avoided, and to pursue the opposite things. All that host <lb/>
            of words then be sure is quite unmeaning, which has been drawn <lb/>
            out in array against the senses. Once more, as in a building, if <lb/>
            the rule first applied is wry, and the square is untrue and swerves <lb/>
            from its straight lines, and if there is the slightest hitch in any <lb/>
            part of the level, all the construction must be faulty, all must be <lb/>
            wry crooked sloping, leaning forwards, leaning backwards, without <lb/>
            symmetry, so that some parts seem ready to fall, others do fall, <lb/>
            ruined all by the first erroneous measurements; so too all reason <lb/>
            of things must needs prove to you distorted and false, which is <lb/>
            founded on false senses.</p>
          <p>And now to explain in what way the other senses do each <lb/>
            perceive their several objects, is the nowise arduous task which <lb/>
            is still left.</p>
          <p>In the first place all sound and voice is heard when they have <lb/>
            made their way into the ears and have struck with their body <lb/>
            the sense of hearing. For voice too and sound you must admit to <lb/>
            be bodily, since they are able to act upon the senses. Again voice <lb/>
            often abrades the throat, and shouting in passing forth makes the <lb/>
            windpipe more rough: when to wit the first-beginnings of voices <lb/>
            have risen up in larger mass and commenced to pass abroad <lb/>
            through their strait passage, you are to know the door of the <lb/>
            mouth now crammed itself is abraded. There is no doubt then <lb/>
            that voices and words consist of bodily first-beginnings, with the <lb/>
            power to hurt; nor can you fail to know how much of body is <lb/>
            taken away and how much is withdrawn from men's very sinews <pb n="97"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="536−577"/> <lb/>
            and strength by a speech continued without interruption from <lb/>
            the dawning brightness of morning to the shadow of black <lb/>
            night, above all if it has been poured forth with much loud <lb/>
            shouting. Voice therefore must be bodily, since a man by much <lb/>
            speaking loses a portion from his body. Next roughness of <lb/>
            voice comes from roughness of first-beginnings, as smoothness <lb/>
            is produced from smoothness. Nor are the first-beginnings of <lb/>
            like shape which pierce the ears in these two cases : when the <lb/>
            trumpet brays dully in deep low tones, the barbarian country <lb/>
            roused echoing back the hoarse hollow sound, and when swans <lb/>
            from the headstrong torrents of Helicon raise their clear-toned <lb/>
            dirge with plaintive voice.</p>
          <p>When therefore we force these voices forth from the depths <lb/>
            of our body and discharge them straight out at the mouth, the <lb/>
            pliant tongue deft fashioner of words gives them articulate utter­ <lb/>
            ance and the structure of the lips does its part in shaping them. <lb/>
            Therefore when the distance is not long between the point from <lb/>
            which each several voice has started and that at which it arrives, <lb/>
            the very words too must be plainly heard and distinguished syl­ <lb/>
            lable by syllable; for each voice retains its structure and retains <lb/>
            its shape. But if the space between be more than is suitable, <lb/>
            the words must be huddled together in passing through much <lb/>
            air and the voice be disorganised in its flight through the same. <lb/>
            Therefore it is that you can hear a sound, yet cannot distinguish <lb/>
            what the meaning of the words is : so huddled and hampered is the <lb/>
            voice when it comes. Again a single word often stirs the ears <lb/>
            of a whole assembly of people, when uttered by the crier's mouth. <lb/>
            One voice therefore in a moment starts asunder into many voices, <lb/>
            since it distributes itself separately into all the ears, stamping <lb/>
            upon them the form and distinct sound of the word. But such <lb/>
            of the voices as do not fall directly on the ears, are carried past <lb/>
            and lost, fruitlessly dispersed in air: some striking upon solid <lb/>
            spots are thrown back and give back a sound and sometimes <lb/>
            mock by an echo of the word. When you fully perceive all this, <lb/>
            you may explain to yourself and others how it is that in lonely <lb/>
            spots rocks give back in regular succession forms of words like to <lb/>
            those sent forth, as we seek our comrades straying about among <lb/>
            the darkened hills and with loud voice call upon them scattered <lb/>
            abroad. I have seen places give back as many as six or seven <note type="footnote"> M. III. </note> <note type="footnote"> G </note> <lb/>
            <pb n="98"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="577−617"/><lb/>
            voices, when you sent forth one: in such wise did the very hill,, <lb/>
            dash back on hills and repeat the words thus trained to come <lb/>
            back. These spots the people round fancy that the goat-footed <lb/>
            satyrs and nymphs inhabit, and tell that they are the fauns by <lb/>
            whose night-pervading noise and sportive play as they declare the <lb/>
            still silence is broken and sounds produced of stringed instru­ <lb/>
            ments and sweet plaintive melodies, such as the pipe pours forth <lb/>
            when beaten by the fingers of the players; the country-people <lb/>
            hearing far and wide, what time Pan nodding the piny covering of <lb/>
            his head half a beast's oft runs over the gaping reeds with curved <lb/>
            lip, making the pipe without ceasing to pour forth its wood­ <lb/>
            land song. Other such like prodigies and marvels they tell of, <lb/>
            that they may not haply be thought to inhabit lonely places, <lb/>
            abandoned even by the gods. On this account they vaunt such <lb/>
            wonders in their stories or are led on by some other reason; <lb/>
            inasmuch as the whole race of man is all too greedy after listen­ <lb/>
            ing ears.</p>
          <p>To proceed, you need not wonder how it is that through <lb/>
            places, through which the eyes cannot see plain things, voices <lb/>
            come and strike the ears. We often see a conversation go on <lb/>
            even through closed doors, sure enough because the voice can <lb/>
            pass uninjured through the winding openings of things, while idols <lb/>
            refuse to pass: they are torn to shreds, if the openings through <lb/>
            which they glide are not straight, like those of glass, through <lb/>
            which every image passes. Again a voice distributes itself in <lb/>
            all directions, since voices are begotten one out of another, when <lb/>
            a single voice has once gone forth and sprung into many, as a <lb/>
            spark of fire is often wont to distribute itself into its constituent <lb/>
            fires. Therefore places are filled with voices, which though far <lb/>
            withdrawn out of view yet are all in commotion and stirred by <lb/>
            sound. But idols all proceed in straight courses as soon as they <lb/>
            have been discharged; and therefore you can never see beyond a <lb/>
            wall, but you may hear voices outside it. And yet this very voice <lb/>
            even in passing through the walls of houses is blunted and enters <lb/>
            the ears in a huddled state, and we seem to hear the sound rather <lb/>
            than the actual words.</p>
          <p>The tongue and palate whereby we perceive flavour, have not <lb/>
            in them anything that calls for longer explanation or offers more <lb/>
            difficulty. In the first place we perceive flavour in the mouth <pb n="99"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="617−657"/> <lb/>
            when we press it out in chewing our food, in the same way as <lb/>
            when one haply begins to squeeze with his hand and dry a sponge <lb/>
            full of water. Next the whole of what we press out distributes <lb/>
            itself through the cavities of the palate and the intricate openings <lb/>
            of the porous tongue. Therefore when the bodies of oozing fla­ <lb/>
            vour are smooth, they pleasantly touch and pleasantly feel all <lb/>
            the parts about the moist exuding quarters of the palate. But <lb/>
            on the other hand when they rise in a mass they puncture and <lb/>
            tear the sense according to the degree in which they are pervaded <lb/>
            by roughness. Next the pleasure from the flavour reaches as far <lb/>
            as the palate; when however it has passed down through the <lb/>
            throat, there is no pleasure while it is all distributing itself into <lb/>
            the frame. And it makes no matter what the food is with which <lb/>
            the body is nurtured, provided you can digest what you take and <lb/>
            transmit it into the frame and keep the stomach in an equable <lb/>
            condition of moistness.</p>
          <p>I will now explain how it is that different food is pleasant and <lb/>
            nutritious for different creatures; also why that which to some is <lb/>
            nauseous and bitter, may yet to others seem passing sweet; and <lb/>
            why in these matters the difference and discrepancy is so great <lb/>
            that what to one man is food, to another is rank poison; and <lb/>
            there is actually a serpent which on being touched by a man's <lb/>
            spittle wastes away and destroys itself by gnawing its body. <lb/>
            Again hellebore for us is rank poison, but helps to fatten goats <lb/>
            and quails. That you may know how this comes to pass, first of <lb/>
            all you must remember what we have said before, that the seeds <lb/>
            which are contained in things are mixed up in manifold ways. <lb/>
            Again all living creatures soever which take food, even as they <lb/>
            are unlike on the outside, and, differing in each after its kind, an <lb/>
            exterior contour of limbs bounds them, so likewise are they formed <lb/>
            of seeds of varying shape. Again since the seeds differ, there <lb/>
            must be a discrepancy in the spaces between and the passages, <lb/>
            which we name openings, in all the limbs and mouth and palate <lb/>
            as well. Some openings therefore must be smaller, some larger; <lb/>
            some things must have them three-cornered, others square; many <lb/>
            must be round, some many-angled after many fashions. For as <lb/>
            the relation between the shapes of seeds and their motions re­ <lb/>
            quire, the openings also must differ accordingly in their shapes; <lb/>
            and the passages must vary, as varies the texture formed by the <note type="footnote"> G 2 </note> <lb/>
            <pb n="100"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="657−695"/><lb/>
            seeds which bound them. For this reason when that which is <lb/>
            sweet to some becomes bitter to others, for that creature to whom <lb/>
            it is sweet the smoothest bodies must enter the cavities of the <lb/>
            palate with power to feel them all over; but on the other hand In <lb/>
            the case of those to whom the same thing is bitter within, rough <lb/>
            and barbed seeds sure enough pass down the throat. It is easy <lb/>
            now from these principles to understand all particular cases: thus <lb/>
            when a fever has attacked any one from too great a flow of bile, or <lb/>
            a violent disease has been excited in any other way, thereupon the <lb/>
            whole body is disordered and all the arrangements of particles <lb/>
            then and there changed; the consequence of which is that the <lb/>
            bodies which before were suited to excite sensation, suit no more; <lb/>
            and those fit it better, which are able to make their way in and <lb/>
            beget a bitter sense. Both kinds for instance are mixed up in the <lb/>
            flavour of honey: a point we have often proved before.</p>
          <p>Now mark me, and I will discuss the way in which the coil­ <lb/>
            tact of smell affects the nostrils: and first there must be many <lb/>
            things from which a varied flow of smells streams and rolls on; <lb/>
            and we must suppose that they thus stream and discharge and <lb/>
            disperse themselves among all things alike; but one smell fits <lb/>
            itself better to one creature, another to another on account of <lb/>
            their unlike shapes; and therefore bees are drawn on by the <lb/>
            smell of honey through the air to a very great distance, and <lb/>
            so are vultures by carcases. Also the onward-reaching power <lb/>
            of scent in dogs leads them whithersoever the cloven hoof of <lb/>
            wild beasts has carried them in their course; and the smell of <lb/>
            man is felt far away by the saviour of the Romans' citadel, the <lb/>
            bright white goose. Thus different scents assigned to different <lb/>
            creatures led each to its appropriate food and constrain them <lb/>
            to recoil from nauseous poison, and in this way the races of beasts <lb/>
            are preserved.</p>
          <p>Of all these different smells then which strike the nostrils <lb/>
            one may reach to a much greater distance than another; though <lb/>
            none of them is carried so far as sound, as voice, to say nothing <lb/>
            of things which strike the eyesight and provoke vision. For in <lb/>
            its mazy course each comes slowly on and is sooner lost, being <lb/>
            gradually dispersed into the readily receiving expanse of air; <lb/>
            first because coming out of its depths it with difficulty discharges <lb/>
            itself from the thing: for the fact that all things are found to <lb/>
            <pb n="101"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="695−738"/><lb/>
            have a stronger smell when crushed, when pounded, when broken <lb/>
            up by fire, shews that odours stream and withdraw from the inner <lb/>
            parts of things: next you may see that smell is formed of larger <lb/>
            first-beginnings than voice, since it does not pass through stone <lb/>
            walls, through which voice and sound are borne without fail. For <lb/>
            this reason also you will find that it is not so easy to trace out in <lb/>
            what quarter a thing which smells is situated; for the blow cools <lb/>
            down as it loiters through the air, and the courier particles of <lb/>
            things are no longer hot when they finish their race to sense; for <lb/>
            which reason dogs are often at fault and lose the scent.</p>
          <p>But what I have said is not found in smells and in the class <lb/>
            of flavours only, but also the forms and colours of things are not <lb/>
            all so well suited to the senses of all, but that some will be more <lb/>
            distressing to the sight than others. Moreover ravenous lions <lb/>
            cannot face and bear to gaze upon a cock with flapping wings <lb/>
            putting night to rout and wont to summon morning with shrill <lb/>
            voice: in such wise they at once bethink themselves of flight, <lb/>
            because sure enough in the body of cocks are certain seeds, and <lb/>
            these, when they have been discharged into the eyes of lions, bore <lb/>
            into the pupils and cause such sharp pain that courageous though <lb/>
            they be, they cannot continue to face them ; while at the same <lb/>
            time these things cannot hurt at all our sight, either because <lb/>
            they do not enter in or because the moment they enter a free <lb/>
            passage out of the eyes is granted them, so that they cannot by <lb/>
            staying behind hurt the eyes in any part.</p>
          <p>Now mark, and hear what things move the mind, and learn <lb/>
            in a few words whence the things which come into it do come. <lb/>
            I say first of all that idols of things wander about many in num­ <lb/>
            ber in many ways in all directions round, extremely thin; and <lb/>
            these when they meet, readily unite, like a cobweb or piece of <lb/>
            gold-leaf. For these idols are far thinner in texture than those <lb/>
            which take possession of the eyes and provoke vision; since these <lb/>
            enter in through the porous parts of the body and stir the fine <lb/>
            nature of the mind within and provoke sensation. Therefore we <lb/>
            see Centaurs and limbs of Scyllas and Cerberus-like faces of dogs <lb/>
            and idols of those who are dead, whose bones earth holds in its <lb/>
            embrace; since idols of every kind are everywhere borne about, <lb/>
            partly those which are spontaneously produced within the air, <lb/>
            partly all those which withdraw from various things and those <pb n="102"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="738−778"/> <lb/>
            which are formed by compounding the shapes of these. For as­ <lb/>
            suredly no image of Centaur is formed out of a live one, since <lb/>
            no such nature of living creature ever existed ; but when images <lb/>
            of a horse and a man have by chance come together, they readily <lb/>
            adhere at once, as we said before, on account of their fine nature <lb/>
            and thin texture. All other things of the kind are produced in <lb/>
            like fashion. And when these from extreme lightness are borne <lb/>
            on with velocity, as I shewed before, any one subtle composite <lb/>
            image you like readily moves the mind by a single stroke; for the <lb/>
            mind is fine and is itself wondrously nimble.</p>
          <p>That all this is done as I relate you may easily learn from <lb/>
            what follows. So far as the one is like the other, seeing with <lb/>
            the mind and seeing with the eyes must be produced in a like <lb/>
            way. Well then since I have shewn that I perceive for instance <lb/>
            a lion by means of idols which provoke the eyes, you may be sure <lb/>
            that the mind is moved in a like way, which by means of idols <lb/>
            sees a lion or anything else just as well as the eyes, with this <lb/>
            difference that it perceives much thinner idols. And when sleep <lb/>
            has prostrated the body, for no other reason does the mind's in­ <lb/>
            telligence wake, except because the very same idols provoke our <lb/>
            minds which provoke them when we are awake, and to such a <lb/>
            degree that we seem without a doubt to perceive him whom life <lb/>
            has left and death and earth gotten hold of. This nature con­ <lb/>
            strains to come to pass because all the senses of the body are then <lb/>
            hampered and at rest throughout the limbs and cannot refute the <lb/>
            unreal by real things. Moreover memory is prostrate and relaxed <lb/>
            in sleep and protests not that he has long been in the grasp of <lb/>
            death and destruction whom the mind believes it sees alive. Fur­ <lb/>
            thermore it is not strange that idols move and throw about their <lb/>
            arms and other limbs in regular measure: for sometimes in sleep <lb/>
            an image is seen to do this: when the first to wit has gone and <lb/>
            a second then been born in another posture, that former one <lb/>
            seems to have altered its attitude. This remember you must <lb/>
            assume to take place with exceeding celerity: so great is the velo­ <lb/>
            city, so great the store of things; so great in any one unit of time <lb/>
            that sense can seize is the store of particles, out of which the <lb/>
            supply may go on.</p>
          <p>And here many questions present themselves and many points <lb/>
            must be cleared up by us, if we desire to give a plain exposition <pb n="103"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="778−823"/> <lb/>
            of things. The first question is why, when the wish has occurred <lb/>
            to any one to think of a thing, his mind on the instant thinks <lb/>
            of that very thing. Do idols observe our will, and so soon as we <lb/>
            will does an image present itself to us, if sea, if earth, ay or heaven <lb/>
            is what we wish ? Assemblies of men, a procession, feasts, battles, <lb/>
            everything in short does nature at command produce and pro­ <lb/>
            vide ? and though to increase the marvel the mind of others in <lb/>
            the same spot and room is thinking of things all quite different. <lb/>
            What again are we to say, when we see in sleep idols advance <lb/>
            in measured tread and move their pliant limbs, when in nimble <lb/>
            wise they put out each pliant arm in turn and represent to the <lb/>
            eyes over and over again an action with foot that moves in time ? <lb/>
            Idols to wit are imbued with art and move about well-trained, <lb/>
            to be able in the night-time to exhibit such plays. Or will this <lb/>
            rather be the truth ? because in one unit of time, when we can <lb/>
            perceive it by sense and while one single word is uttered, many <lb/>
            latent times are contained which reason finds to exist, therefore <lb/>
            in any time you please all the several idols are at hand ready <lb/>
            prepared in each several place. And because they are so thin, <lb/>
            the mind can see distinctly only those which it strains itself to <lb/>
            see; therefore all that there are besides are lost, save only those <lb/>
            for which it has made itself ready. Moreover it makes itself <lb/>
            ready and hopes to see that which follows upon each thing; there­ <lb/>
            fore the result does follow. Do you not see that the eyes also, <lb/>
            when they essay to discern things which are thin and fine, strain <lb/>
            themselves and make themselves ready, and without that we can­ <lb/>
            not see distinctly ? And yet you may observe even in things <lb/>
            which are plain before us, that if you do not attend, it is just as if <lb/>
            the thing were all the time away and far distant. What wonder <lb/>
            then, if the mind loses all other things save those with which it is <lb/>
            itself earnestly occupied ? Then too from small indications we <lb/>
            draw the widest inferences and by our own fault entangle our­ <lb/>
            selves in the meshes of self-delusion.</p>
          <p>Sometimes it happens too that an image of the same kind is <lb/>
            not supplied, but what before was a woman, turns out in our <lb/>
            hands to have changed into a man; or a different face and age <lb/>
            succeed to the first. But sleep and forgetfulness prevent us from <lb/>
            feeling surprise at this.</p>
          <p>And herein you should desire with all your might to shun <pb n="104"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="823−865"/> <lb/>
            the weakness, with a lively apprehension to avoid the mistake <lb/>
            of supposing that the bright lights of the eyes were made in order <lb/>
            that we might see ; and that the tapering ends of the shanks and <lb/>
            hams are attached to the feet as a base In order to enable us to <lb/>
            step out with long strides; or again that the forearms were slung <lb/>
            to the stout upper arms and ministering hands given us on each <lb/>
            side, that we might be able to discharge the needful duties of <lb/>
            life. Other explanations of like sort which men give, one and all <lb/>
            put effect for cause through wrongheaded reasoning; since nothing <lb/>
            was born in the body that we might use it, but that which is born <lb/>
            begets for itself a use: thus seeing did not exist before the eyes <lb/>
            were born, nor the employment of speech ere the tongue was <lb/>
            made; but rather the birth of the tongue was long anterior to <lb/>
            language and the ears were made long before sound was heard, <lb/>
            and all the limbs, I trow, existed before there was any employ­ <lb/>
            ment for them: they could not therefore have grown for the pur­ <lb/>
            pose of being used. But on the other hand engaging in the strife <lb/>
            of battle and mangling the body and staining the limbs with gore <lb/>
            were in vogue long before glittering darts ever flew; and nature <lb/>
            prompted to shun a wound or ever the left arm by the help of <lb/>
            art held up before the person the defence of a shield. Yes and <lb/>
            consigning the tired body to rest is much older than a soft­ <lb/>
            cushioned bed, and the slaking of thirst had birth before cups. <lb/>
            These things therefore which have been invented in accordance <lb/>
            with the uses and wants of life, may well be believed to have <lb/>
            been discovered for the purpose of being used. Far otherwise is <lb/>
            it with all those things which first were born, then afterwards <lb/>
            made known the purposes to which they might be put; at the <lb/>
            head of which class we see the senses and the limbs. Wherefore <lb/>
            again and again I repeat, it is quite impossible to believe that <lb/>
            they could have been made for the duties which they discharge.</p>
          <p>It ought likewise to cause no wonder that the nature of the <lb/>
            body of each living creature absolutely requires food. I have <lb/>
            shewn that bodies ebb away and withdraw from things, many in <lb/>
            number in many ways; but most numerous must be those which <lb/>
            withdraw from living things; for because these are tried by active <lb/>
            motion, and many particles are pressed out from the depths of <lb/>
            the frame and carried off by sweating, many breathed out through <lb/>
            the mouth, when they pant from exhaustion, from such causes <pb n="105"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="865−906"/> <lb/>
            the body becomes rarefied and the whole nature undermined; and <lb/>
            this state is attended by pain. Food therefore is taken in order <lb/>
            to give support to the frame and recruit the strength by its <lb/>
            infusion, and to close up the open-mouthed craving for meat <lb/>
            throughout limbs and veins. The moisture too passes into all the <lb/>
            parts which call for moisture; and many accumulated bodies of <lb/>
            heat which cause a burning in our stomach, the approach of liquid <lb/>
            scatters and quenches as if they were fire, so that dry heat can <lb/>
            no longer parch the frame. In this way then you see gasping <lb/>
            thirst is drenched out of our body, in this way the hungry craving <lb/>
            is satisfied.</p>
          <p>Now how it comes to pass that we are able to step out when <lb/>
            we please, and how it is given us to move about our limbs, and <lb/>
            what cause is wont to push forward the great load of this our <lb/>
            body I will tell: do you take in my words. I say that idols of <lb/>
            walking first present themselves to our mind and strike on the <lb/>
            mind, as we said before: then the will arises; for no one begins <lb/>
            to do anything, until his mind has first determined what it wills. <lb/>
            From the very fact that it determines such thing, there is an <lb/>
            image of that thing. When therefore the mind bestirs itself in <lb/>
            such a way as to will to walk and step out, it strikes at the same <lb/>
            moment the force of the soul which is spread over the whole <lb/>
            body throughout the limbs and frame; and this is easily done, <lb/>
            since the whole is held in close union with the mind. Next the <lb/>
            soul in its turn strikes the body, and thus the whole mass by <lb/>
            degrees is pushed on and set in motion. Then again the body <lb/>
            becomes also rarefied, and the air, as you see its nature is, being <lb/>
            always so nimble in moving, comes and passes in great quantity <lb/>
            through the opened pores and is thus distributed into the most <lb/>
            minute parts of the body. In this way then by these two causes <lb/>
            acting in two ways the body like a ship is carried on by sails and <lb/>
            wind. And herein it need not excite any surprise that such very <lb/>
            minute bodies can steer so great a body and turn about the <lb/>
            whole of this our load; for wind though fine with subtle body <lb/>
            drives and pushes on a large ship of large moving mass and one <lb/>
            hand directs it however great the speed at which it is going and <lb/>
            one rudder steers it to any point you like; and by means of <lb/>
            blocks of pulleys and tread-wheels a machine stirs many things of <lb/>
            great weight and raises them up with slight effort.</p><pb n="106"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="907−948"/> Now by what means yon sleep lets a stream of repose over <lb/>
            the limbs and dispels from the breast the cares of the mind, I <lb/>
            will tell in sweetly worded rather than in many verses; as the <lb/>
            short song of the swan is better than the loud noise of cranes <lb/>
            scattered abroad amid the ethereal clouds of the south. Do you <lb/>
            lend me a nice ear and a keen mind, that you may not deny <lb/>
            what I say to be possible and secede with breast disdainfully <lb/>
            rejecting the words of truth, you yourself being in fault the while <lb/>
            and unable to discern. Sleep mainly takes place when the force <lb/>
            of the soul has been scattered about through the frame, and In <lb/>
            part has been forced abroad and taken its departure, and in part <lb/>
            has been thrust back and has withdrawn into the depths of the <lb/>
            body: after that the limbs arc relaxed and droop. For there is <lb/>
            no doubt that this sense exists in us by the agency of the soul; <lb/>
            and when sleep obstructs the action of this sense, then we must <lb/>
            assume that our soul has been disordered and forced abroad; not <lb/>
            indeed all; for then the body would lie steeped in the everlasting <lb/>
            chill of death. Where no part of the soul remained behind con­ <lb/>
            cealed in the limbs, as fire remains concealed when buried under <lb/>
            much ash, whence could sense be suddenly rekindled through the <lb/>
            limbs, as flame can spring up from hidden fire ?</p>
          <p>But by what means this change of condition is accomplished <lb/>
            and from what the soul can be disordered and the body grow <lb/>
            faint, I will explain: do you mind that I waste not my words <lb/>
            on the wind. In the first place the body in its outer side, since <lb/>
            it is next to and is touched by the air, must be thumped and <lb/>
            beaten by its repeated blows; and for this reason all things as <lb/>
            a rule are covered either by a hide or else by shells or by a <lb/>
            callous skin or by bark. When creatures breathe, this air at the <lb/>
            same time buffets the inner side also, as it is inhaled and exhaled. <lb/>
            Therefore since the body is beaten on both sides alike and blows <lb/>
            arrive by means of the small apertures at the primal parts and <lb/>
            primal elements of our body, there gradually ensues a sort of <lb/>
            breaking up throughout our limbs, the arrangements of the first- <lb/>
            beginnings of body and mind getting disordered. Then next a <lb/>
            part of the soul is forced out and a part withdraws into the inner <lb/>
            recesses; a part too scattered about through the frame cannot get <lb/>
            united together and so act and be acted upon by motion; for <lb/>
            nature intercepts all communication and blocks up all the pas­ <pb n="107"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="949−989"/> <lb/>
            sages; and therefore sense retires deep into the frame as the <lb/>
            motions are all altered. And since there is nothing as it were <lb/>
            to lend support to the frame, the body becomes weak and all the <lb/>
            limbs are faint, the arms and eyelids droop and the hams even in <lb/>
            bed often give way under you and relax their powers. Then <lb/>
            sleep follows on food, because food produces just the same effects <lb/>
            as air, while it is distributed into all the veins; and that sleep is <lb/>
            much the heaviest which you take when full or tired, because <lb/>
            then the greatest number of bodies fall into disorder, bruised by <lb/>
            much exertion. On the same principle the soul comes in part to <lb/>
            be forced more deeply into the frame, and there is also a more <lb/>
            copious emission of it abroad, and at the same time it is more <lb/>
            divided and scattered in itself within you.</p>
          <p>And generally to whatever pursuit a man is closely tied down <lb/>
            and strongly attached, on whatever subject we have previously <lb/>
            much dwelt, the mind having been put to a more than usual <lb/>
            strain in it, during sleep we for the most part fancy that we are <lb/>
            engaged in the same; lawyers think they plead causes and draw <lb/>
            up covenants of sale, generals that they fight and engage in battle, <lb/>
            sailors that they wage and carry on war with the winds, we think <lb/>
            we pursue our task and investigate the nature of things con­ <lb/>
            stantly and consign it when discovered to writings in our native <lb/>
            tongue. So all other pursuits and arts are seen for the most <lb/>
            part during sleep to occupy and mock the minds of men. And <lb/>
            whenever men have given during many days in succession undi­ <lb/>
            vided attention to games, we generally see that after they have <lb/>
            ceased to perceive these with their senses, there yet remain pas­ <lb/>
            sages open in the mind through which the same idols of things <lb/>
            may enter. Thus for many days those same objects present them­ <lb/>
            selves to the eyes, so that even when awake they see dancers <lb/>
            as they think moving their pliant limbs, and receive into the ears <lb/>
            the clear music of the harp and speaking strings, and behold the <lb/>
            same spectators and at the same time the varied decorations of <lb/>
            the stage in all their brilliancy. So great is the influence of zeal <lb/>
            and inclination, so great is the influence of the things in which <lb/>
            men have been habitually engaged, and not men only but all <lb/>
            living creatures. Thus you will see stout horses, even when their <lb/>
            bodies are lying down, yet in their sleep sweat and pant without <lb/>
            ceasing and strain their powers to the utmost as if for the prize, <lb/>
            <pb n="108"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="990−1040"/><lb/>
            or as if the barriers were thrown open * . And often during <lb/>
            soft repose the dogs of hunters do yet all at once throw about <lb/>
            their legs and suddenly utter cries and repeatedly snuff the air <lb/>
            with their nostrils, as though they had found and were on the <lb/>
            tracks of wild beasts; and after they are awake often chase the <lb/>
            shadowy idols of stags, as though they saw them in full flight, <lb/>
            until they have shaken off their delusions and come to them­ <lb/>
            selves again. And the fawning brood of dogs brought up tame in <lb/>
            the house haste to shake their body and raise it up from the <lb/>
            ground, as if they beheld unknown faces and features. And the <lb/>
            fiercer the different breeds are, the greater rage they must dis­ <lb/>
            play in sleep. But the various kinds of birds flee and suddenly <lb/>
            in the night- time trouble with their wings the groves of the gods, <lb/>
            when in gentle sleep hawks and pursuing birds have appeared to <lb/>
            shew fight and offer battle. Again the minds of men which pur­ <lb/>
            sue great aims under great emotions, often during sleep pursue <lb/>
            and carry on the same in like manner; kings take by storm, are <lb/>
            taken, join battle, raise a loud cry as if stabbed on the spot. <lb/>
            Many struggle hard and utter groans in pain, and as if gnawed <lb/>
            by the bite of panther or cruel lion fill all the place with loud <lb/>
            cries. Many during sleep speak of important affairs and have <lb/>
            often and often disclosed their own guilt. Many meet death; <lb/>
            many as if tumbling down from high precipices to the ground <lb/>
            with their whole body, are scared with terror and after sleep as <lb/>
            if out of their judgment scarce come to themselves again, quite <lb/>
            disordered by their body's turmoil. Again a thirsty man sits <lb/>
            down beside a river or a pleasant spring and gulps down well­ <lb/>
            nigh all the stream. Cleanly people often, when sound asleep, <lb/>
            believing that they are lifting their dress beside a urinal or the <lb/>
            public vessels, pour forth the filtered liquid of their whole body, <lb/>
            and the Babylonian coverlets of surpassing brilliancy are drenched. <lb/>
            Then too those, into the boiling currents of whose age seed is for <lb/>
            the first time passing, when the ripe fulness of days has produced <lb/>
            it in their limbs, idols encounter from without from what body <lb/>
            soever, harbingers of a glorious face and a beautiful bloom, which <lb/>
            stir and excite the frame.</p>
          <p>That seed we have spoken of before is stirred up in us, as soon <lb/>
            as ripe age fortifies the frame. For as different causes set in <lb/>
            motion and excite different things, so from man the sole influence <lb/>
            <pb n="109"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="1040−1082"/><lb/>
            of man draws forth human seed. As soon then as it has been <lb/>
            forced out from and quits its proper seats throughout the limbs <lb/>
            and frame, it withdraws itself from the whole body and meets <lb/>
            together in appropriate places and rouses forthwith the appropriate <lb/>
            parts of the body. The places are excited and swell with seed, and <lb/>
            the inclination arises to emit the seed towards that to which the <lb/>
            fell desire all tends, and the body seeks that object from which <lb/>
            the mind is wounded by love; for all as a rule fall towards their <lb/>
            wound and the blood spirts out in that direction whence comes the <lb/>
            stroke by which we are struck; and if he is at close quarters, the <lb/>
            red stream covers the foe. Thus then he who gets a hurt from <lb/>
            the weapons of Venus, whatever be the object that hits him, in­ <lb/>
            clines to the quarter whence he is wounded, and yearns to unite <lb/>
            with it and join body with body; for a mute desire gives a presage <lb/>
            of the pleasure.</p>
          <p>This pleasure is for us Venus; from that desire is the Latin <lb/>
            name of love, from that desire has first trickled into the heart yon <lb/>
            drop of Venus' honeyed joy, succeeded soon by chilly care; for <lb/>
            though that which you love is away, yet idols of it are at hand and <lb/>
            its sweet name is present to the ears. But it is meet to fly idols <lb/>
            and scare away all that feeds love and turn your mind on another <lb/>
            object, distract your passion elsewhere and not keep it, with your <lb/>
            thoughts once set on one object by love of it, and so lay up for <lb/>
            yourself care and unfailing pain. For the sore gathers strength <lb/>
            and becomes inveterate by feeding, and every day the madness <lb/>
            grows in violence and the misery becomes aggravated, unless you <lb/>
            erase the first wounds by new blows and first heal them when yet <lb/>
            fresh, roaming abroad after Venus the pandemian, or transfer to <lb/>
            something else the emotions of your mind.</p>
          <p>Nor is he who shuns love without the fruits of Venus, but <lb/>
            rather enjoys those blessings which are without any pain: doubt­ <lb/>
            less the pleasure from such things is more unalloyed for the <lb/>
            healthy-minded than for the love-sick; for in the very moment of <lb/>
            enjoying the burning desire of lovers wavers and wanders unde­ <lb/>
            cided, and they cannot tell what first to enjoy with eyes and hands. <lb/>
            What they have sought, they tightly squeeze and cause pain of <lb/>
            body and often imprint their teeth on the lips and clash mouth to <lb/>
            mouth in kissing, because the pleasure is not pure and there are <pb n="110"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="1082−1123"/> <lb/>
            hidden stings which stimulate to hurt even that whatever it is <lb/>
            from which spring those germs of frenzy. But Venus with light <lb/>
            hand breaks the force of these pains during love, and the fond <lb/>
            pleasure mingled therein reins in the bites. For in this there is <lb/>
            hope, that from the same body whence springs their burning <lb/>
            desire, their flame may likewise be quenched; though nature <lb/>
            protests that the very opposite is the truth ; and this is the one <lb/>
            thing of all, in which, when we have most of it, then all the more <lb/>
            the breast burns with fell desire. Meat and drink arc taken into <lb/>
            the body; and as they can fill up certain fixed parts, in this way <lb/>
            the craving for drink and bread is easily satisfied; but from the <lb/>
            face and beautiful bloom of man nothing is given into the body <lb/>
            to enjoy save flimsy idols; a sorry hope which is often snatched <lb/>
            off by the wind. As when in sleep a thirsty man seeks to drink <lb/>
            and water is not given to quench the burning in his frame, but he <lb/>
            seeks the idols of waters and toils in vain and thirsts as he drinks <lb/>
            in the midst of the torrent stream, thus in love Venus mocks lovers <lb/>
            with idols, nor can bodies satisfy them by all their gazing upon <lb/>
            them nor can they with their hands rub aught off the soft limbs, <lb/>
            wandering undecided over the whole body. At last when they <lb/>
            have united and enjoy the flower of age, when the body now has a <lb/>
            presage of delights and Venus is in the mood to sow the fields of <lb/>
            woman, they greedily clasp each other's body and suck each other's <lb/>
            lips and breathe in, pressing meanwhile teeth on each other's mouth; <lb/>
            all in vain, since they can rub nothing off nor enter and pass each <lb/>
            with his whole body into the other's body; for so sometimes they <lb/>
            seem to will and strive to do: so greedily are they held in the <lb/>
            chains of Venus, while their limbs melt overpowered by the might <lb/>
            of the pleasure. At length when the gathered desire has gone <lb/>
            forth, there ensues for a brief while a short pause in the burning <lb/>
            passion; and then returns the same frenzy, then comes back the <lb/>
            old madness, when they are at a loss to know what they really <lb/>
            desire to get, and cannot find what device is to conquer that <lb/>
            mischief; in such utter uncertainty they pine away by a hidden <lb/>
            wound.</p>
          <p>Then too they waste their strength and ruin themselves by <lb/>
            the labour, then too their life is passed at the beck of another. <lb/>
            Meanwhile their estate runs away and is turned into Babylonian <pb n="111"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="1123−1163"/> <lb/>
            coverlets; duties are neglected and their good name staggers and <lb/>
            sickens. On her feet laugh elastic and beautiful Sieyonian shoes, <lb/>
            yes, and large emeralds with green light are set in gold and the <lb/>
            sea-coloured dress is worn constantly and much used drinks in the <lb/>
            sweat. The noble earnings of their fathers are turned into hair­ <lb/>
            bands, head-dresses; sometimes are changed into a sweeping robe <lb/>
            and Alidensian and Cean dresses. Feasts set out with rich cover­ <lb/>
            lets and viands, games, numerous cups, perfumes crowns and gar­ <lb/>
            lands are prepared; all in vain, since out of the very well-spring <lb/>
            of delights rises up something of bitter, to pain amid the very <lb/>
            flowers; either when the conscience-stricken mind Imply gnaws <lb/>
            itself with remorse to think that it is passing a life of sloth and <lb/>
            ruining itself in brothels, or because she has launched forth some <lb/>
            word and left its meaning in doubt and it cleaves to the love-sick <lb/>
            heart and burns like living fire, or because it fancies she casts her <lb/>
            eyes too freely about or looks on another, and it sees in her face <lb/>
            traces of a smile.</p>
          <p>And these evils are found in love that is lasting and highly <lb/>
            prosperous; but in crossed and hopeless love are ills such as you <lb/>
            may seize with closed eyes, past numbering; so that it is better to <lb/>
            watch beforehand in the manner I have prescribed, and be on your <lb/>
            guard not to be drawn in. For to avoid falling into the toils of <lb/>
            love is not so hard as, after you are caught, to get out of the nets <lb/>
            you are in and to break through the strong meshes of Venus. <lb/>
            And yet even when you are entangled and held fast you may <lb/>
            escape the mischief, unless you stand in your own way and begin <lb/>
            by overlooking all the defects of her mind or those of her body, <lb/>
            whoever it is whom you court and woo. For this men usually do, <lb/>
            blinded by passion, and attribute to the beloved those advantages <lb/>
            which are not really theirs. We therefore see women in ways <lb/>
            manifold deformed and ugly to be objects of endearment and held <lb/>
            in the highest admiration. And one lover jeers at others and <lb/>
            advises them to propitiate Venus, since they are troubled by a <lb/>
            disgraceful passion, and often, poor wretch, gives no thought to his <lb/>
            own ills greatest of all. The black is a brune, the filthy and rank <lb/>
            has not the love of order; the cat-eyed is a miniature Pallas, the <lb/>
            stringy and wizened a gazelle; the dumpy and dwarfish is one of <lb/>
            the graces, from top to toe all grace; the big and overgrown is <lb/>
            <pb n="112"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="1163−1200"/><lb/>
            awe-inspiring and full of dignity. She is tongue-tied, cannot speak, <lb/>
            then she has a lisp; the dumb is bashful; then the fire-spit, the <lb/>
            teazing, the gossiping turns to a shining lamp. One becomes a <lb/>
            slim darling then when she cannot live from want of flesh ; and <lb/>
            she is only spare, who is half-dead with cough. Then the fat and <lb/>
            big-breasted is a Ceres' self big-breasted from Iacchus; the pug­ <lb/>
            nosed is a she Silenus and a satyress; the thick-lipped a very kiss. <lb/>
            It were tedious to attempt to report other things of the kind. Let <lb/>
            her however be of ever so great dignity of appearance; such that <lb/>
            the power of Venus goes forth from all her limbs; yet there are <lb/>
            others too; yet have we lived without her before; yet does she do, <lb/>
            and we know that she does, in all things the same as -the ugly <lb/>
            woman; and .fumigates herself, poor wretch, with nauseous per­ <lb/>
            fumes, her very maids running from her and giggling behind her <lb/>
            back. But the lover, when shut out, often in tears covers the <lb/>
            threshold with flowers and wreaths, and anoints the haughty door­ <lb/>
            posts with oil of marjoram and imprints kisses, poor wretch, on the <lb/>
            doors. When however he has been admitted, if on his approach <lb/>
            but one single breath should come in his way, he would seek <lb/>
            specious reasons for departing, and the long-conned deep-drawn <lb/>
            complaint would fall to the ground; and then he would blame his <lb/>
            folly, on seeing that he had attributed to her more than it is right <lb/>
            to concede to a mortal. Nor is this unknown to our Venuses; <lb/>
            wherefore all the more they themselves hide with the utmost pains <lb/>
            all that goes on behind the scenes of life from those whom they <lb/>
            wish to retain in the chains of love; but in vain, since you may <lb/>
            yet draw forth from her mind into the light all these things and <lb/>
            search into all her smiles; and if she is of a fair mind and not <lb/>
            troublesome, overlook them in your turn and make allowance for <lb/>
            human failings.</p>
          <p>Nor does the woman sigh always with feigned passion, when <lb/>
            she locks in her embrace and joins with her body the man's body <lb/>
            and holds it, sucking his lips into her lips and drinking in his <lb/>
            kisses. Often she does it from the heart, and seeking mutual joys <lb/>
            courts him to run the complete race of love. And in no other <lb/>
            way could birds cattle, wild beasts, sheep and mares submit to bear <lb/>
            the males, except because the very exuberance of nature in the <lb/>
            females is in heat and burns and joyously draws in the Venus of <lb/>
            <pb n="113"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="1200−1237"/><lb/>
            the covering males. See you not too how those whom mutual <lb/>
            pleasure has chained are often tortured in their common chains ? <lb/>
            How often in the highways do dogs, desiring to separate, eagerly <lb/>
            pull different ways with all their might, while all the time they <lb/>
            are held fast in the strong fetters of Venus! This they would <lb/>
            never do, unless they experienced mutual joys, strong enough to <lb/>
            force them into the snare and hold them in its meshes. Where­ <lb/>
            fore again and again I repeat there is a common pleasure.</p>
          <p>And when haply in mixing her seed with the man's the <lb/>
            woman by sudden force has overpowered and seized for herself <lb/>
            his force, then children are formed from the mothers' seed like <lb/>
            to the mothers, as from the fathers' seed like to the fathers. <lb/>
            But those whom you see with a share of both forms, blending <lb/>
            equally the features of the parents, grow from the union of the <lb/>
            father's body and the mother's blood, when the mutual ardour <lb/>
            of desire working in concert has brought and clashed together the <lb/>
            seeds roused throughout the frame by the goads of Venus; and <lb/>
            neither of the two has gotten the mastery nor has been mastered. <lb/>
            Sometimes too the children may spring up like their grandfathers <lb/>
            and often resemble the forms of their grandfathers' fathers, be­ <lb/>
            cause the parents often keep concealed in their bodies many first- <lb/>
            beginnings mixed in many ways, which first proceeding from the <lb/>
            original stock one father hands down to the next father; and then <lb/>
            from these Venus produces forms after a manifold chance and <lb/>
            repeats not only the features, but the voices and hair of their <lb/>
            forefathers. And the female sex equally springs from the father's <lb/>
            seed and males go forth equally formed from the mother's body; <lb/>
            since these distinctions no more proceed from the fixed seed of <lb/>
            one or other parent than our faces and bodies and limbs: the <lb/>
            birth is always formed out of the two seeds; and whichever <lb/>
            parent that which is produced more resembles, of that parent <lb/>
            it has more than an equal share; as you may equally observe, <lb/>
            whether it is a male child or a female birth.</p>
          <p>Nor do the divine powers debar anybody from the power of <lb/>
            begetting, forbidding him ever to receive the name of father <lb/>
            from sweet children and forcing him to pass his life in a barren <lb/>
            wedlock; as men commonly fancy when in sorrow they drench <lb/>
            the altars with much blood and pile the raised altars with offer- <note type="footnote"> M. III. </note> <note type="footnote"> it </note> <pb n="114"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="1238−1278"/> <lb/>
            ings, to make their wives pregnant with abundant seed. In vain <lb/>
            they weary the divinity of the gods and the sacred lots. They <lb/>
            are barren sometimes from the too great thickness of the seed, <lb/>
            sometimes from its undue fluidity and thinness: because the thin <lb/>
            is unable to get a firm hold on the right spots, it at once passes <lb/>
            away and is repelled and withdrawn abortively: since by others <lb/>
            again a too thick seed is discharged in a state more solid than is <lb/>
            suitable, it either does not fly forth with so prolonged a stroke <lb/>
            or cannot equally pass into the proper spots or when it has passed <lb/>
            in with difficulty mixes with the woman's seed. For well-as­ <lb/>
            sorted matches are found to be of great importance; and some <lb/>
            males impregnate some females more readily than others, and <lb/>
            other females conceive and become pregnant more readily from <lb/>
            other males. And many women have hitherto been barren during <lb/>
            several marriages and have yet in the end found mates from <lb/>
            whom they could conceive children and be enriched with a sweet <lb/>
            offspring. And often even for those, to whom hitherto wives <lb/>
            however fruitful had been unable in their house to bear, has been <lb/>
            found a compatible nature, enabling them to fortify their age <lb/>
            with sons. Of such great importance is it, in order that seeds <lb/>
            may agree and blend with seeds in a way to promote birth, <lb/>
            whether the thick comes into contact with the fluid and the fluid <lb/>
            with the thick. And on this point it matters much on what diet <lb/>
            life is supported; for by some foods seed is thickened in the <lb/>
            limbs, and by others again is thinned and wasted. And in what <lb/>
            modes the intercourse goes on, is likewise of very great moment; <lb/>
            for women are commonly thought to conceive more readily after <lb/>
            the manner of wild beasts and quadrupeds, because the seeds in <lb/>
            this way can find the proper spots in consequence of the position <lb/>
            of the body. Nor have wives the least use for effeminate motions: <lb/>
            a woman hinders and stands in the way of her own conceiving, <lb/>
            when thus she acts; for she drives the furrow out of the direct <lb/>
            course and path of the share and turns away from the proper <lb/>
            spots the stroke of the seed. And thus for their own ends <lb/>
            harlots are wont to move, in order not to conceive and lie in <lb/>
            child-bed frequently, and at the same time to render Venus more <lb/>
            attractive to men. This our wives have surely no need of.</p>
          <p>Sometimes too by no divine grace and arrows of Venus a <pb n="115"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="1279−1287"/> <lb/>
            sorry woman of inferior beauty comes to be loved; for the wife <lb/>
            sometimes by her own acts and accommodating manners and by <lb/>
            elegant neatness of person readily habituates you to pass your life <lb/>
            with her. Moreover custom renders love attractive; for that <lb/>
            which is struck by oft-repeated blows however lightly, yet after <lb/>
            long course of time is overpowered and gives way. See you not <lb/>

          <p>Who is able with powerful genius to frame a poem worthy of <lb/>
            the grandeur of the things and these discoveries ? or who is so <lb/>
            great a master of words as to be able to devise praises equal to <lb/>
            the deserts of him who left to us such prizes won and earned <lb/>
            by his own genius ? None methinks who is formed of mortal <lb/>
            body. For if we must speak as the acknowledged grandeur of <lb/>
            the things itself demands, a god he was, a god, most noble Mem­ <lb/>
            mius, who first found out that plan of life which is now termed <lb/>
            wisdom, and who by trained skill rescued life from such great <lb/>
            billows and such thick darkness and moored it in so perfect a <lb/>
            calm and in so brilliant a light. Compare the godlike discoveries <lb/>
            of others in old times: Ceres is famed to have pointed out to mor­ <lb/>
            tals corn, and Liber the vine-born juice of the grape; though life <lb/>
            might well have subsisted without these things, as we are told <lb/>
            some nations even now live without them. But a happy life was <lb/>
            not possible without a clean breast; wherefore with more reason <lb/>
            this man is deemed by us a god, from whom come those sweet <lb/>
            solaces of existence which even now are distributed over great <lb/>
            nations and gently soothe men's minds. Then if you shall sup­ <lb/>
            pose that the deeds of Hercules surpass his, you will be carried <lb/>
            still farther away from true reason. For what would yon great <lb/>
            gaping maw of Nemean lion now harm us and the bristled Arca­ <lb/>
            than boar ? ay or what could the bull of Crete do and the hydra <lb/>
            plague of Lerna, fenced round with its envenomed snakes ? or how <lb/>
            could the triple-breasted might of threefold Geryon, [how could <lb/>
            the birds with brazen arrowy feathers] that dwelt in the Stym­ <pb n="117"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="29−72"/> <lb/>
            phalian swamps do us such mighty injury, and the horses of <lb/>
            Thracian Diomede breathing fire from their nostrils along the <lb/>
            Bistonian borders and Ismara ? and the serpent which guards the <lb/>
            bright golden apples of the Hesperides, fierce, dangerous of aspect, <lb/>
            girding the tree's stem with his enormous body, what harm pray <lb/>
            could he do us beside the Atlantic shore and its sounding main, <lb/>
            which none of us goes near and no barbarian ventures to ap­ <lb/>
            proach ? And all other monsters of the kind which have been <lb/>
            destroyed, if they had not been vanquished, what harm could they <lb/>
            do, I ask, though now alive ? None methinks: the earth even <lb/>
            now so abounds to repletion in wild beasts and is filled with <lb/>
            troublous terror throughout woods and great mountains and deep <lb/>
            forests; places which we have it for the most part in our own <lb/>
            power to shun. But unless the breast is cleared, what battles and <lb/>
            dangers must then find their way into us in our own despite! <lb/>
            what poignant cares inspired by lust then rend the distressful <lb/>
            man, and then also what mighty fears! and pride, filthy lust and <lb/>
            wantonness ? what disasters they occasion! and luxury and all <lb/>
            sorts of sloth ? He therefore who shall have subdued all these <lb/>
            and banished them from the mind by words, not arms, shall he not <lb/>
            have a just title to be ranked among the gods ? and all the more <lb/>
            so that he was wont to deliver many precepts in beautiful and god­ <lb/>
            like phrase about the immortal gods themselves and to open up <lb/>
            by his teachings all the nature of things.</p>
          <p>While walking in his footsteps I follow out his reasonings and <lb/>
            teach by my verses, by what law all things are made, what neces­ <lb/>
            sity there is then for them to continue in that law, and how impo­ <lb/>
            tent they are to annul the binding statutes of time: foremost in <lb/>
            which class of things the nature of the mind has been proved to be <lb/>
            formed of a body that had birth and to be unable to endure <lb/>
            unscathed through great time, mere idols being wont to mock <lb/>
            the mind in sleep, when we seem to see him whom life has aban­ <lb/>
            doned : to continue, the order of my design has now brought me to <lb/>
            this point, where I must proceed to shew that the world is formed <lb/>
            of a mortal body and at the same time had birth; to shew too in <lb/>
            what way that union of matter founded earth heaven sea stars sun <lb/>
            and the ball of the moon; also what living creatures sprang out <lb/>
            of the earth, as well as those which never at any time were born; <lb/>
            in what way too mankind began to use with one another varied <pb n="118"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="72−112"/> <lb/>
            speech by the names conferred on things; and also in what ways <lb/>
            yon fear of the gods gained an entry into men's breasts, and now <lb/>
            throughout the world maintains as holy fanes lakes groves altars <lb/>
            and idols of the gods. Furthermore I shall make clear by what <lb/>
            force piloting nature guides the courses of the sun and the wander­ <lb/>
            ings of the moon; lest haply we imagine that these of their <lb/>
            own free will between heaven and earth traverse their everlasting <lb/>
            orbits, graciously furthering the increase of crops and living crea­ <lb/>
            tures, or we think they roll on by any forethought of the gods. <lb/>
            For they who have been rightly taught that the gods lead a life <lb/>
            without care, if nevertheless they wonder by what plan all things <lb/>
            can be carried on, above all in regard to those things which are <lb/>
            seen overhead in the ethereal borders, are borne back again into <lb/>
            their old religious scruples and take unto themselves hard task­ <lb/>
            masters, whom they poor wretches believe to be almighty, not <lb/>
            knowing what can, what cannot be, in short by what system each <lb/>
            thing has its powers defined, its deep-set boundary mark.</p>
          <p>Well then not to detain you any longer by mere promises, <lb/>
            look before all on seas and lands and heaven: their threefold <lb/>
            nature, their three bodies, Memmius, three forms so unlike, three <lb/>
            such wondrous textures a single day shall give over to destruction; <lb/>
            and the mass and fabric of the world upheld for many years <lb/>
            shall tumble to ruin. Nor can I fail to perceive with what a <lb/>
            novel and strange effect it falls upon the mind, this destruction of <lb/>
            heaven and earth that is to be, and how hard it is for me to pro­ <lb/>
            duce a full conviction of it by words; as is the case when you <lb/>
            bring to the ears a thing hitherto unexampled, and yet you cannot <lb/>
            submit it to the eyesight nor put it into the hands; through which <lb/>
            the straightest highway of belief leads into the human breast <lb/>
            and quarters of the mind. But yet I will speak out: it well may <lb/>
            be that the reality itself will bring credit to my words and that <lb/>
            you will see earthquakes arise and all things grievously shattered <lb/>
            to pieces in a short time. But this may pilot fortune guide far <lb/>
            away from us, and may reason rather than the reality convince <lb/>
            that all things may be overpowered and tumble in with a fright­ <lb/>
            ful crash.</p>
          <p>But before I shall begin on this question to pour forth decrees <lb/>
            of fate with more sanctity and much more certainty than the <lb/>
            Pythia who speaks out from the tripod and laurel of Phoebus, <pb n="119"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="113−157"/> <lb/>
            I will clearly set forth to yon many comforting topics in learned <lb/>
            language; lest held in the yoke of religion you haply suppose that <lb/>
            earth and sun and heaven, sea stars and moon must last for ever <lb/>
            with divine body; and therefore think it right that they after the <lb/>
            fashion of the giants should all suffer punishment for their mon­ <lb/>
            strous guilt, who by their reasoning displace the walls of the world <lb/>
            and seek to quench the glorious sun of heaven, branding immortal <lb/>
            things in mortal speech; though in truth these things are so far <lb/>
            from possessing divinity and are so unworthy of being reckoned in <lb/>
            the number of gods, that they may be thought to afford a notable <lb/>
            instance of what is quite without vital motion and sense. For it <lb/>
            is quite impossible to suppose that the nature and judgment <lb/>
            of the mind can exist with any body whatever; even as a tree <lb/>
            cannot exist- in the ether nor clouds in the salt sea, nor can fishes <lb/>
            live in the fields nor blood exist in woods nor sap in stones. Where <lb/>
            each thing can grow and abide is fixed and ordained. Thus the <lb/>
            nature of the mind cannot come into being alone without the <lb/>
            body nor exist far away from the sinews and blood. But if (for <lb/>
            this would be much more likely to happen than that) the force <lb/>
            itself of the mind might be in the head or shoulders or heels or <lb/>
            might be born in any other part of the body, it would after all <lb/>
            be wont to abide in one and the same man or vessel. But since <lb/>
            in our body even it is fixed and seen to be ordained where the <lb/>
            soul and the mind can severally be and grow, it must still more <lb/>
            strenuously be denied that it can abide out of the body and the <lb/>
            living form altogether in crumbling clods of earth or in the fire <lb/>
            of the sun or in water or in the high borders of ether. These <lb/>
            things therefore are not possessed of divine sense, since they can­ <lb/>
            not be quickened with the vital feeling.</p>
          <p>This too you may not possibly believe, that the holy seats <lb/>
            of the gods exist in any parts of the world : the fine nature of <lb/>
            the gods far withdrawn from our senses is hardly seen by the <lb/>
            thought of the mind; and since it has ever eluded the touch and <lb/>
            stroke of the hands, it must touch nothing which is tangible for us; <lb/>
            for that cannot touch which does not admit of being touched in <lb/>
            turn. And therefore their seats as well must be unlike our seats, <lb/>
            fine, even as their bodies are fine. All which I will prove to you <lb/>
            later in copious argument. To say again that for the sake of men <lb/>
            they have willed to set in order the glorious nature of the world <pb n="120"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="157−197"/> <lb/>
            and therefore it is meet to praise the work of the gods calling as it <lb/>
            does for all praise, and to believe that it will be eternal and <lb/>
            immortal, and that it is an unholy thing ever to shake by any <lb/>
            force from its fixed seats that which by the forethought of the <lb/>
            gods in ancient days has been established on everlasting founda­ <lb/>
            tions for mankind, or to assail it by speech and utterly overturn it <lb/>
            from top to bottom; and to invent and add other figments of <lb/>
            the kind, Memmius, is all sheer folly. For what advantage can <lb/>
            our gratitude bestow on immortal and blessed beings, that for our <lb/>
            sakes they should take in hand to administer aught ? And what <lb/>
            novel incident should have induced them hitherto at rest so long <lb/>
            after to desire to change their former life ? for it seems natural he <lb/>
            should rejoice in a new state of things, whom old things annoy; <lb/>
            but for him whom no ill has befallen in times gone by, when he <lb/>
            passed a pleasant existence, what could have kindled in such <lb/>
            a one a love of change ? Did life lie grovelling in darkness and <lb/>
            sorrow, until the first dawn of the birthtime of things ? or what <lb/>
            evil had it been for us never to have been born ? whoever has <lb/>
            been born must want to continue in life, so long as fond pleasure <lb/>
            shall keep him; but for him who has never tasted the love, never <lb/>
            been on the lists, of life, what harm not to have been born ? <lb/>
            Whence again was first implanted in the gods a pattern for beget­ <lb/>
            ting things in general as well as the preconception of what men <lb/>
            are, so that they knew and saw in mind what they wanted to <lb/>
            make ? and in what way was the power of first-beginnings ever <lb/>
            ascertained, and what they could effect by a change in their <lb/>
            mutual arrangements, unless nature herself gave the model for <lb/>
            making things ? For in suchwise the first-beginnings of things <lb/>
            many in number in many ways impelled by blows for infinite <lb/>
            ages back and kept in motion by their own weights have been <lb/>
            wont to be carried along and to unite in all manner of ways and <lb/>
            thoroughly test every kind of production possible by their mutual <lb/>
            combinations; that it is not strange if they have also fallen <lb/>
            into arrangements and have come into courses like to those <lb/>
            out of which this sum of things is now carried on by constant <lb/>
            renewing.</p>
          <p>But if I did not know what first-beginnings of things are, <lb/>
            yet this judging by the very arrangements of heaven I would <lb/>
            venture to affirm, and led by many other facts to maintain, that <pb n="121"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="198−240"/> <lb/>
            the nature of things has by no means been made for us by <lb/>
            divine power: so great are the defects with which it is encum­ <lb/>
            bered. In the first place of all the space which the vast reach <lb/>
            of heaven covers, a portion greedy mountains and forests of wild <lb/>
            beasts have occupied, rocks and wasteful pools take up and the <lb/>
            sea which holds wide apart the coasts of different lands. Next of <lb/>
            nearly two thirds burning heat and the constant fall of frost rob <lb/>
            mortals. What is left for tillage, even that nature by its power <lb/>
            would overrun with thorns, unless the force of man made head <lb/>
            against it, accustomed for the sake of a livelihood to groan be­ <lb/>
            neath the strong hoe and to cut through the earth by pressing <lb/>
            down the plough. Unless by turning up the fruitful clods with <lb/>
            the share and labouring the soil of the earth we stimulate things <lb/>
            to rise, they could not spontaneously come up into the clear air; <lb/>
            and even then sometimes when things earned with great toil now <lb/>
            put forth their leaves over the lands and are all in blossom, either <lb/>
            the ethereal sun burns them up with excessive heats or sudden <lb/>
            rains and cold frosts cut them off, and the blasts of the winds <lb/>
            waste them by a furious hurricane. Again why does nature give <lb/>
            food and increase to the frightful race of wild beasts dangerous <lb/>
            to mankind both by sea and land ? why do the seasons of the year <lb/>
            bring diseases in their train ? why stalks abroad untimely death ? <lb/>
            Then too the baby, like to a sailor cast away by the cruel waves, <lb/>
            lies naked on the ground, speechless, wanting every furtherance <lb/>
            of life, soon as nature by the throes of birth has shed him forth <lb/>
            from his mother's womb into the borders of light: he fills the <lb/>
            room with a rueful wauling, as well he may whose destiny it is <lb/>
            to go through in life so many ills. But the different flocks herds <lb/>
            and wild beasts grow up; they want no rattles; to none of them <lb/>
            need be addressed the fond broken accents of the fostering nurse; <lb/>
            they ask not different dresses according to the season; no nor <lb/>
            do they want arms or lofty walls, whereby to protect their own, <lb/>
            the earth itself and nature manifold in her works producing in <lb/>
            plenty all things for all.</p>
          <p>First of all, since the body of the earth and water and the <lb/>
            light breath of air and burning heats, out of which this sum of <lb/>
            things is seen to be formed, do all consist of a body that had a <lb/>
            birth and is mortal, the whole nature of the world must be <lb/>
            reckoned of a like body. For those things whose parts and mem­ <pb n="122"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="241−279"/> <lb/>
            bers we see to be of a body that had a birth and of forms that <lb/>
            are mortal, we perceive to be likewise without exception mortal, <lb/>
            and at the same time to have had a birth. Since therefore I <lb/>
            see that the chiefest members and parts of the world are destroy­ <lb/>
            ed and begotten anew, I may be sure that for heaven and earth <lb/>
            as well there has been a time of beginning and there will be a <lb/>
            time of destruction.</p>
          <p>And herein that you may not think I have unfairly seized <lb/>
            on this point for myself, because I have assumed that earth and <lb/>
            fire are mortal and have not doubted that water and air perish, <lb/>
            and have said that these are likewise begotten and grow afresh, <lb/>
            mark the proofs: first of all some portion of the earth, burnt up <lb/>
            by constant, suns, trampled by a multitude of feet, sends forth a <lb/>
            cloud and flying eddies of dust, which the strong winds disperse <lb/>
            over the whole air. Part too of the soil is put under water by <lb/>
            rains, and rivers graze against and eat into the banks. Again <lb/>
            whatever increases something else, is in its turn replenished; and <lb/>
            since beyond a doubt earth the universal mother is found at the <lb/>
            same time to be the general tomb of things, therefore you see she <lb/>
            is lessened and increases and grows again</p>
          <p>Furthermore, that sea rivers fountains always stream over <lb/>
            with new moisture and that waters well up without ceasing, it <lb/>
            needs no words to prove : the great flow of waters from all sides <lb/>
            clearly shews it. But then the water on the surface is always <lb/>
            taken off, and thus it is that on the whole there is no overflow, <lb/>
            partly because the seas are lessened by the strong winds sweep­ <lb/>
            ing over them and by the ethereal sun decomposing them with <lb/>
            his rays; partly, because the water is diffused below the surface <lb/>
            over all lands; for the salt is strained off and the matter of liquid <lb/>
            streams back again to the source and all meets together at the <lb/>
            river-heads, and then flows over the lands in a fresh current, <lb/>
            where a channel once scooped out has carried down the waters <lb/>
            with liquid foot.</p>
          <p>And next I will speak of the air which is changed over its <lb/>
            whole body every hour in countless ways. For whatever ebbs <lb/>
            from things, is all borne always into the great sea of air; and <lb/>
            unless it in return were to give back bodies to things and to re­ <lb/>
            cruit them as they ebb, all things ere now would have been dis­ <lb/>
            solved and changed into air. It therefore ceases not to be begotten <pb n="123"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="279−322"/> <lb/>
            from things and to go back again into things, since it is a fact <lb/>
            that all things constantly ebb.</p>
          <p>Likewise the abundant source of clear light, the ethereal sun, <lb/>
            constantly floods heaven with fresh brightness and supplies the <lb/>
            place of light on the instant by new light; for every previous emis­ <lb/>
            sion of brightness is quite lost to it, wherever it falls. This you <lb/>
            may know from the following examples: as soon as ever clouds <lb/>
            begin to pass below the sun and to break off so to say the rays of <lb/>
            light, forthwith their lower part is wholly lost, and the earth is <lb/>
            overshadowed wherever the clouds pass over; so that you may <lb/>
            know that things constantly require new irradiation and that all <lb/>
            the preceding emissions of light are lost, and in no other way can <lb/>
            things be seen in the sun, unless the fountain head of light itself <lb/>
            send a supply. Moreover, you see, nightly lights which belong to <lb/>
            earth, such as hanging lamps and torches bright with darting <lb/>
            flames, hasten in like fashion amid great darkness with minister­ <lb/>
            ing heat to supply new light; are eager to bicker with fires, ay <lb/>
            eager; nor is the light ever broken off nor does it quit the spots <lb/>
            illuminated: with such suddenness is its destruction concealed by <lb/>
            the swift birth of flame from all the fires at once. In the same <lb/>
            way then we must believe that sun moon and stars emit light <lb/>
            from fresh and ever fresh supplies rising up, and always lose every <lb/>
            previous discharge of flames; that you may not haply believe that <lb/>
            these flourish indestructible.</p>
          <p>Again see you not that even stones are conquered by time, <lb/>
            that high towers fall and rocks moulder away, that shrines and <lb/>
            idols of gods are worn out with decay, and that the holy divinity <lb/>
            cannot prolong the bounds of fate or struggle against the fixed <lb/>
            laws of nature ? Then see we not the monuments of men, fallen <lb/>
            to ruin, ask for themselves as well whether you'd believe that they <lb/>
            decay with years ? see we not basalt rocks tumble down riven <lb/>
            away from high mountains and unable to endure and suffer the <lb/>
            strong might of finite age ? surely they would never fall suddenly <lb/>
            thus riven away, if for infinite time past they had held out against <lb/>
            all the batteries of age without a crash.</p>
          <p>Again gaze on this, which about and above holds in its em­ <lb/>
            brace all the earth: if it begets all things out of itself, as some <lb/>
            say, and takes them back when they are destroyed, then the <lb/>
            whole of it has had a birth and is of a mortal body; for whatever <lb/>
            <pb n="124"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="322−363"/><lb/>
            gives increase and food out of itself to other things, must be les­ <lb/>
            sened ; and must be replenished, when it takes things back.</p>
          <p>Again if there was no birth-time of earth and heaven and <lb/>
            they have been from everlasting, why before the Theban war and <lb/>
            the destruction of Troy have not other poets as well sung other <lb/>
            themes ? whither have so many deeds of men so often passed <lb/>
            away, why live they nowhere embodied in lasting records of fame ? <lb/>
            The truth methinks is that the sum has but a recent date and <lb/>
            the nature of the world is new and has but lately had its com­ <lb/>
            mencement. Wherefore even now some arts are receiving their <lb/>
            last polish, some are even in course of growth : just now many <lb/>
            improvements have been made in ships; only yesterday musicians <lb/>
            have given birth to tuneful melodies; then too this nature or <lb/>
            system of things has been discovered lately, and I the very first <lb/>
            of all have only now been found able to transfer it into native <lb/>
            words. But if haply ybu believe that before this all things have <lb/>
            existed just the same, but that the generations of men have <lb/>
            perished by burning heat, or that cities have fallen by some great <lb/>
            concussion of the world, or that after constant rains devouring <lb/>
            rivers have gone forth over the earth and have whelmed towns, <lb/>
            so much the more you must yield and admit that there will be <lb/>
            entire destruction too of earth and heaven; for when things were <lb/>
            tried by so great distempers and so great dangers, at that time <lb/>
            had a more disastrous cause pressed upon them, they would far <lb/>
            and wide have gone to destruction and mighty ruin. And in no <lb/>
            other way are we proved to be mortals, except because we all alike <lb/>
            in turn fall sick of the same diseases which those had whom nature <lb/>
            has withdrawn from life.</p>
          <p>Again whatever things last for ever, must either, because <lb/>
            they are of solid body, repel strokes and not suffer aught to pass <lb/>
            into them, sufficient to disunite the closely massed parts within: <lb/>
            such are the bodies of matter whose nature we have shewn be­ <lb/>
            fore: or they must be able to endure through all time for this <lb/>
            reason, because they are exempt from blows, as void is which <lb/>
            remains untouched and suffers not a jot from any stroke; or else <lb/>
            because there is no extent of room around, into which things so <lb/>
            to say may depart and be broken up: in this way the sum of sums <lb/>
            is eternal and there is no place outside into which things may <lb/>
            spring asunder, nor are there any bodies which can fall upon <lb/>
            <pb n="125"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="363−404"/><lb/>
            them and dissolve them by a powerful blow. But the nature of <lb/>
            the world, as I have shewn, is neither of solid body, since void <lb/>
            is mixed up in things, nor is it again like void, no nor is there <lb/>
            lack of bodies that may haply rise up in mass out of the infinite <lb/>
            and overthrow this sum of things with furious tornado or bring <lb/>
            upon them some other perilous disaster; nor further is the nature <lb/>
            of room or the space of deep void wanting, into which the walls <lb/>
            of the world may be scattered abroad; or they may be assailed <lb/>
            and perish by some other force. Therefore the gate of death is <lb/>
            not closed against heaven or sun or earth or the deep waters of <lb/>
            the sea, but stands open and looks towards them with huge <lb/>
            wide-gaping maw. And therefore also you must admit that these <lb/>
            things likewise had a birth ; for things which are of mortal <lb/>
            body could not for an infinite time back up to the present have <lb/>
            been able to set at naught the puissant strength of immeasurable <lb/>
            age.</p>
          <p>Again since the chiefest members of the world fight so hotly <lb/>
            together, fiercely stirred by no hallowed civil warfare, see you not <lb/>
            that some limit may be set to their long struggle ? either when the <lb/>
            sun and all heat shall have drunk up all the waters and gotten the <lb/>
            mastery : this they are ever striving to do, but as yet are unable to <lb/>
            accomplish their endeavours : such abundant supplies the rivers <lb/>
            furnish, and threaten to turn aggressors and flood all things with a <lb/>
            deluge from the deep gulfs of ocean; all in vain, since the winds <lb/>
            sweeping over the seas and the ethereal sun decomposing them <lb/>
            with his rays do lessen them, and trust to be able to dry all things <lb/>
            up before water can attain the end of its endeavour. Such a war <lb/>
            do they breathe out with undecided issue, and strive with each <lb/>
            other to determine it for mighty ends; though once by the way <lb/>
            fire got the upper hand and once, as the story goes, water reigned <lb/>
            paramount in the fields. Fire gained the mastery and licked and <lb/>
            burnt up many things, when the headstrong might of the horses of <lb/>
            the sun dashed from the course and hurried Phaethon through the <lb/>
            whole sky and over all lands. But the almighty father, stirred <lb/>
            then to fierce wrath, with a sudden thunderstroke dashed Phae­ <lb/>
            thon down from his horses to earth, and the sun meeting him as <lb/>
            he fell caught from him the ever-burning lamp of the world and <lb/>
            got in hand the scattered steeds and yoked them shaking all over; <lb/>
            then guided them on their proper course and gave fresh life to all <pb n="126"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="404−447"/> <lb/>
            things. Thus to wit have the old poets of the Greeks sung; <lb/>
            though it is all too widely at variance with true reason. Fire may <lb/>
            gain the mastery when more bodies of matter than usual have <lb/>
            gathered themselves up out of the infinite; and then its powers <lb/>
            decay, vanquished in some way or other, or else things perish <lb/>
            burnt up by the torrid air. Water too of yore gathered itself and <lb/>
            began to get the mastery, as the story goes, when it whelmed <lb/>
            many cities of men; and then when all that force that had <lb/>
            gathered itself up out of the infinite, by some means or other was <lb/>
            turned aside and withdrew, the rains were stayed and the rivers <lb/>
            abated their fury.</p>
          <p>But in what ways yon concourse of matter founded earth and <lb/>
            heaven and the deeps of the sea, the courses of the sun and moon, <lb/>
            I will next in order describe. For verily not by design did the <lb/>
            first-beginnings of things station themselves each in its right place <lb/>
            by keen intelligence, nor did they bargain sooth to say what <lb/>
            motions each should assume, but because the first-beginnings of <lb/>
            things many in number in many ways impelled by blows for infi­ <lb/>
            nite ages back and kept in motion by their own weights have been <lb/>
            wont to be carried along and to unite in all manner of ways and <lb/>
            thoroughly to test every kind of production possible by their <lb/>
            mutual combinations, therefore it is that spread abroad through <lb/>
            great time after trying unions and motions of every kind they at <lb/>
            length meet together in those masses which suddenly brought <lb/>
            together become often the rudiments of great things, of earth sea <lb/>
            and heaven and the race of living things.</p>
          <p>At this time then neither could the sun's disk be discerned <lb/>
            flying aloft with its abundant light, nor the stars of great ether, <lb/>
            nor sea nor heaven, no nor earth nor air, nor could any thing be <lb/>
            seen like to our things, but only a strange stormy crisis and <lb/>
            medley, gathered together out of first-beginnings of every kind, <lb/>
            whose state of discord joining battle disordered their interspaces <lb/>
            passages connexions weights blows clashings and motions, because <lb/>
            by reason of their unlike forms and varied shapes they could not <lb/>
            all remain thus joined together nor fall into mutually harmonious <lb/>
            motions. Then next the several parts began to fly asunder and <lb/>
            things to be joined like with like and to mark off the world and <lb/>
            portion out its members and arrange its mighty parts, that is <lb/>
            to say, to separate high heaven from earth, and let the sea spread <pb n="127"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="447−491"/> <lb/>
            itself out apart with its unmixed water, and likewise let the fires <lb/>
            of ether spread apart pure and unmixed.</p>
          <p>For first the several bodies of earth, because they were heavy <lb/>
            and closely entangled, met together in the middle and took up all <lb/>
            of them the lowest positions; and the more they got entangled <lb/>
            and the closer their union, the more they squeezed out those par­ <lb/>
            ticles which were to make up sea stars sun and moon and the walls <lb/>
            of the great world. All these are of smooth and round seeds and <lb/>
            of much smaller elements than the earth. Therefore the fire- <lb/>
            laden ether first burst out from the different parts of the earth <lb/>
            through all the porous openings and lightly bore off with itself <lb/>
            many fires; much in the same way as we often see, so soon as the <lb/>
            morning light of the beaming sun blushes golden over the grass <lb/>
            jewelled with dew, and the pools and the ever-running rivers <lb/>
            exhale a mist, and even as the earth itself is sometimes seen to <lb/>
            smoke; and when all these are gathered together aloft, then do <lb/>
            clouds on high with a now cohering body weave a covering beneath <lb/>
            heaven. In this way therefore then the light and expansive ether <lb/>
            with its now cohering body swept round and arched itself on all <lb/>
            sides and expanding widely in all directions round in this way <lb/>
            fenced all other things in with its greedy grasp. After it followed <lb/>
            the rudiments of sun and moon, whose spheres turn round in air <lb/>
            midway between earth and ether: these neither earth has taken <lb/>
            unto itself nor greatest ether, because they were neither heavy <lb/>
            enough to sink and settle down nor light enough to glide along <lb/>
            the uppermost borders; they yet however are so placed between <lb/>
            the two as to wheel along their life-like bodies and still to be <lb/>
            parts of the whole world; just as in us some members may be at <lb/>
            rest, while others at the same time are in motion. These things <lb/>
            then being withdrawn, the earth in those parts where the vast <lb/>
            azure level of ocean now spreads, in a moment sank in and <lb/>
            drenched with salt flood the hollows. At every day the more the <lb/>
            heats of ether round and the rays of the sun on all sides compressed <lb/>
            the earth into a close mass by oft-repeated blows on all its outer <lb/>
            edges, so that thus buffeted it was condensed and drawn together <lb/>
            about its centre, ever the more did the salt sweat squeezed out <lb/>
            of its body increase by its oozings the sea and floating fields, and <lb/>
            ever the more did those many bodies of heat and air escape and <lb/>
            fly abroad and condense far away from earth the high glittering <pb n="128"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="491−533"/> <lb/>
            quarters of heaven. The plains sank down, the high hills grew in <lb/>
            elevation; for the rocks could not settle down nor all the parts <lb/>
            sink to one uniform level.</p>
          <p>Thus then the ponderous mass of earth was formed with close- <lb/>
            cohering body and all the slime of the world so to speak slid down <lb/>
            by its weight to the lowest point and settled at the bottom like <lb/>
            dregs. Then the sea, then the air, then the fire-laden ether itself, <lb/>
            all are left unmixed with their clear bodies; and some are lighter <lb/>
            than others, and clearest and lightest of all ether floats upon the <lb/>
            airy currents, and blends not its clear body with the troubled airs; <lb/>
            it suffers all these things below to be upset with furious hurri­ <lb/>
            canes, suffers them to be troubled by wayward storms; while it <lb/>
            carries along its own fires gliding with a changeless onward sweep. <lb/>
            For that ether may stream on gently and with one uniform effort <lb/>
            the Pontos shews, a sea which streams with a changeless current, <lb/>
            ever preserving one uniform gliding course.</p>
          <p>Let us now sing what causes the motions of the stars. In the <lb/>
            first place, if the great sphere of heaven revolves, we must say <lb/>
            that an air presses on the pole at each end and confines it on the <lb/>
            outside and closes it in at both ends; and then that a third air <lb/>
            streams above and moves in the same direction in which roll on <lb/>
            as they shine the stars of the eternal world ; or else that this third <lb/>
            air streams below in order to carry up the sphere in the contrary <lb/>
            direction; just as we see rivers turn wheels and water-scoops. It <lb/>
            is likewise quite possible too that all the heaven remains at rest, <lb/>
            while at the same time the glittering signs are carried on; either <lb/>
            because rapid heats of ether are shut in and whirl round while <lb/>
            seeking a way out and roll their fires in all directions through <lb/>
            heaven's Summanian quarters; or else an air streaming from some <lb/>
            part from another source outside drives and whirls the fires; or <lb/>
            else they may glide on of themselves going whithersoever the food <lb/>
            of each calls and invites them, feeding their flamy bodies every­ <lb/>
            where throughout heaven. For which of these causes is in opera­ <lb/>
            tion in this world, it is not easy to affirm for certain; but what <lb/>
            can be and is done throughout the universe in various worlds <lb/>
            formed on various plans, this I teach, and I go on to set forth <lb/>
            several causes which may exist throughout the universe for the <lb/>
            motions of stars; one of which however must in this world also be <lb/>
            the cause that imparts lively motion to the signs; but to dictate <pb n="129"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="533−571"/> <lb/>
            which of them it is, is by no means the duty of the man who <lb/>
            advances step by step.</p>
          <p>And in order that the earth may rest in the middle of the <lb/>
            world, it is proper that its weight should gradually pass away <lb/>
            and be lessened, and that it should have another nature under­ <lb/>
            neath it conjoined from the beginning of its existence and formed <lb/>
            into one being with the airy portions of the world in which it <lb/>
            is embodied and lives. For this reason it is no burden and does <lb/>
            not weigh down the air; just as his limbs are of no weight to <lb/>
            a man nor is his head a burden to his neck, nor do we feel that <lb/>
            the whole weight of the body rests on the feet; but whatever <lb/>
            weights come from without and are laid upon us, hurt us though <lb/>
            they are often very much smaller: of such great moment it is <lb/>
            what function each thing has to perform. Thus then the earth <lb/>
            is not an alien body suddenly brought in and forced from some <lb/>
            other quarter on air alien to it, but was conceived together with <lb/>
            it at the first birth of the world and is a fixed portion of that <lb/>
            world, just as our limbs are seen to be to us. Again the earth <lb/>
            when suddenly shaken by loud thunder shakes by its motion all <lb/>
            the things which are above it; and this it could in no wise do, <lb/>
            unless it had been fast bound with the airy portions of the world <lb/>
            and with heaven. For the earth and they cohere with one an­ <lb/>
            other by common roots, conjoined and formed into a single being <lb/>
            from the beginning of their existence. See you not too that <lb/>
            great as is the weight of our body, the force of the soul, though <lb/>
            of the extreniest fineness, supports it, because it is so closely <lb/>
            conjoined and formed into a single being with it ? Then too what <lb/>
            is able to lift the body with a nimble bound save the force of <lb/>
            the mind which guides the limbs ? Now do you see what power <lb/>
            a subtle nature may have, when it is conjoined with a heavy <lb/>
            body, as the air is conjoined with the earth and the force of the <lb/>
            mind with us ?</p>
          <p>Again the disk of the sun cannot be much larger nor its <lb/>
            body of heat much smaller, than they appear to be to our senses. <lb/>
            For from whatever distances fires can reach us with their light <lb/>
            and breathe on our limbs burning heat, those distances take away <lb/>
            nothing by such spaces between from the body of the flames, the <lb/>
            fire is not in the least narrowed in appearance. Therefore since <lb/>
            the heat of the sun and the light which it sheds reach our senses <note type="footnote"> M. III. </note> <note type="footnote"> I </note> <lb/>
            <pb n="130"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="571−613"/><lb/>
            and stroke the proper places, the form too and size of the sun <lb/>
            must be seen from this earth in their real dimensions, so that <lb/>
            you may not add anything whatever more or less. And whether <lb/>
            the moon as it is borne on illuminates places with a borrowed <lb/>
            light, or emits its own light from its own body, whatever that is, <lb/>
            the form with which it is thus borne on is not at all larger than <lb/>
            the one which it presents to our eyes seems to us to be. For all <lb/>
            things which we see at a great distance through much air, look <lb/>
            dimmed in appearance before their size is diminished. Therefore <lb/>
            since the moon presents a bright aspect and well-defined form, it <lb/>
            must be seen on high by us from this earth precisely such as it is <lb/>
            in the outline which defines it, and of the size it actually is. <lb/>
            Lastly in the case of all those fires of ether which you observe <lb/>
            from this earth,—since in the case of fires which we see here on <lb/>
            earth, so long as their flickering is distinct, so long as their heat <lb/>
            is perceived, their size is seen sometimes to change to a very <lb/>
            very small extent either way, according to the distance at which <lb/>
            they are,—you may infer that the fires of ether may be smaller <lb/>
            than they look in an extremely minute degree, or larger by a very <lb/>
            small and insignificant fraction.</p>
          <p>This likewise need not excite wonder, how it is that so small <lb/>
            a body as yon sun can emit so great a light, enough to flood <lb/>
            completely seas and all lands and heaven and to steep all things <lb/>
            in its burning heat. It well may be that a single spring for the <lb/>
            whole world may open up from this spot and gush out in plen­ <lb/>
            teous stream and shoot forth light, because elements of heat meet <lb/>
            together from all sides out of the whole world in such manner <lb/>
            and the mass of them thrown together streams to a point in such <lb/>
            manner, that this heat wells forth from a single source. See you <lb/>
            not too what a breadth of meadow-land a small spring of water <lb/>
            sometimes floods, streaming out over the fields ? It is likewise <lb/>
            possible that heat from the sun's flame though not at all great <lb/>
            may infect the whole air with fervent fires, if haply the air is <lb/>
            in a suitable and susceptible state, so that it can be kindled <lb/>
            when struck by small bodies of heat; thus we see sometimes <lb/>
            a general conflagration from a single spark catch fields of corn <lb/>
            and stubble. Perhaps too the sun as he shines aloft with rosy <lb/>
            lamp has round about him much fire with heats that are not <lb/>
            visible, and thus the fire may be marked by no radiance, so that <pb n="131"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="613−653"/> <lb/>
            fraught with heat it increases to such a degree the stroke of <lb/>
            the rays.</p>
          <p>Nor with regard to the sun is there one single explanation, <lb/>
            certain and manifest, of the way in which be passes from his <lb/>
            summer positions to the midwinter turning-point of capricorn <lb/>
            and then coming back from thence bends his course to the sol­ <lb/>
            stitial goal of cancer, and how the moon is seen once a month <lb/>
            to pass over that space, in traversing which the sun spends the <lb/>
            period of a year. No single plain cause, I say, has been assigned <lb/>
            for these things. It seems highly probable that that may be the <lb/>
            truth which the revered judgment of the worthy man Democritus <lb/>
            maintains: the nearer the different constellations are to the earth, <lb/>
            the less they can be carried along with the whirl of heaven; for <lb/>
            the velocity of its force, he says, passes away and the intensity <lb/>
            diminishes in the lower parts, and therefore the sun is gradually <lb/>
            left behind with the rearward signs, because he is much lower <lb/>
            than the burning signs. And the moon more than the sun: the <lb/>
            lower her path is and the more distant she is from heaven and <lb/>
            the nearer she approaches to earth, the less she can keep pace <lb/>
            with the signs. For the fainter the whirl is in which she is borne <lb/>
            „ along, being as she is lower than the sun, so much the more all <lb/>
            the signs around overtake and pass her. Therefore it is that she <lb/>
            appears to come back to every sign more quickly, because the <lb/>
            signs go more quickly back to her. It is quite possible too that <lb/>
            from quarters of the world crossing the sun's path two airs may <lb/>
            stream each in its turn at a fixed time; one of which may force <lb/>
            the sun away from the summer signs so far as his midwinter turn­ <lb/>
            ing-point and freezing cold, and the other may force him back <lb/>
            from the freezing shades of cold as far as the heat-laden quarters <lb/>
            and burning signs. And in like manner we must suppose that the <lb/>
            moon, and the stars which make revolutions of great years in <lb/>
            great orbits may pass by means of airs from opposite quarters in <lb/>
            turn. See you not too that clouds from contrary winds pass in <lb/>
            contrary directions, the upper in a contrary way to the lower ? <lb/>
            Why may not yon stars just as well be borne on through their <lb/>
            great orbits in ether by currents contrary one to the other ?</p>
          <p>But night buries the earth in thick darkness, either when the <lb/>
            sun after his long course has struck upon the utmost parts of <lb/>
            heaven and now exhausted has blown forth all his fires shaken <note type="footnote"> I 2 </note> <lb/>
            <pb n="132"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="653−694"/><lb/>
            by their journey and weakened by passing through much air: or <lb/>
            else because the same force which has carried on his orb above <lb/>
            the earth, compels him to change his course and pass below the <lb/>
            earth.</p>
          <p>At a fixed time too Matuta spreads rosy morning over the <lb/>
            borders of ether and opens up her light, either because the same <lb/>
            sun, coming back below the earth, seizes heaven before his time <lb/>
            trying to kindle it with his rays; or because fires meet together <lb/>
            and many seeds of heat are accustomed to stream together at a <lb/>
            fixed time, which cause new sunlight to be born every day. <lb/>
            Thus they tell that from the high mountains of Ida scattered <lb/>
            fires are seen at day-break, that these then unite as it were into <lb/>
            a single ball and make up an orb. And herein it ought to cause <lb/>
            no surprise that these seeds of fire stream together at a time so <lb/>
            surely fixed and reproduce the radiance of the sun. For we see <lb/>
            many occurrences which take place at a fixed time in all things. <lb/>
            At a fixed time trees blossom and at a fixed time shed their <lb/>
            blossoms; and at a time no less surely fixed age bids the teeth <lb/>
            be shed and the boy put on the soft dress of puberty and let a <lb/>
            soft beard fall down equally from each cheek. Lastly lightnings <lb/>
            snow rains clouds and winds take place at not very irregular sea­ <lb/>
            sons of year. For where causes from their very first beginnings <lb/>
            have been in this way and things have thus fallen out from the <lb/>
            first birth of the world, in due sequence too they now come round <lb/>
            after a fixed order.</p>
          <p>Likewise days may lengthen and nights wane, and days shorten <lb/>
            when the nights receive increase, either because the same sun <lb/>
            running his course below the earth and above in curves of unlike <lb/>
            length parts the borders of ether and divides his orbit into un­ <lb/>
            equal halves; and as he comes round adds on in the opposite half <lb/>
            just as much as he has subtracted from the other of the two <lb/>
            halves, until he has arrived at that sign of heaven, where the node <lb/>
            of the year makes the shades of night of the same length as the <lb/>
            daylight. For when the sun's course lies midway between the <lb/>
            blast of the north and of the south, heaven keeps his two goals <lb/>
            apart at distances now rendered exactly equal on account of the <lb/>
            position of the whole starry circle, in gliding through which the <lb/>
            sun takes up the period of a year, lighting with slanting rays <lb/>
            earth and heaven; as is clearly shewn by the plans of those who <lb/>
            <pb n="133"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="694−735"/><lb/>
            have mapped out all the quarters of heaven as they are set off <lb/>
            with their array of signs. Or else because the air is denser in <lb/>
            certain parts, therefore the quivering beam of fire is retarded <lb/>
            below the earth and cannot easily pass through and force its way <lb/>
            out to its place of rising: for this reason in winter-time nights <lb/>
            linger long, ere the beamy badge of day arrive. Or else, because <lb/>
            in the way just mentioned at alternate parts of the year fires <lb/>
            are accustomed to stream together more slowly and more quickly, <lb/>
            which cause the sun to rise in a certain point, therefore it is that <lb/>
            those appear to speak the truth [who suppose a fresh sun to be <lb/>
            born every day.]</p>
          <p>The moon may shine because struck by the sun's rays, and <lb/>
            turn that light every day more and more directly towards our <lb/>
            sight, in proportion as she recedes from the sun's orb, until just <lb/>
            opposite to him she has shone out with full light and at her <lb/>
            rising as she soars aloft has beheld his setting; and then by <lb/>
            slow steps reversing as it were her course she must in the same <lb/>
            way hide her light, the nearer and nearer she now glides to the <lb/>
            sun from a different quarter through the circle of the signs; <lb/>
            according to the theory of those who suppose the moon to be <lb/>
            like a ball and to hold on her course under the sun. She may <lb/>
            also very possibly revolve with her own light and display various <lb/>
            phases of brightness; for there may well be another body which <lb/>
            is carried on and glides in her company getting before her path <lb/>
            and obstructing her in all manner of ways and yet cannot be <lb/>
            seen, because it glides on without light. She may also revolve, <lb/>
            like it may be to a spherical ball steeped over one half in shining <lb/>
            light, and as she rolls round this sphere she may present changing <lb/>
            phases, until she has turned that half which is illuminated full <lb/>
            towards our sight and open eyes; then by slow steps she whirls <lb/>
            back and withdraws the light-fraught half of the spherical ball; <lb/>
            as the Babylonian science of the Chaldees refuting the system of <lb/>
            the astronomers essays to prove in opposition to them; just as <lb/>
            though that which each party fights for might not be equally true, <lb/>
            or there were any reason why you should venture to embrace the <lb/>
            one theory less than the other. Again, why a new moon should <lb/>
            not be born every day after a regular succession of forms and <lb/>
            regular phases, and each day the one which is born perish and <lb/>
            another be produced in its room and stead, it is not easy to teach <pb n="134"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="735−778"/> <lb/>
            by reasoning or prove by words, since so many things can be born <lb/>
            in such a regular succession. Spring and Venus go their way, <lb/>
            and the winged harbinger of Venus steps on before ; and close on <lb/>
            Zephyr's footprints mother Flora straws all the way before them <lb/>
            and covers it over with the choicest colours and odours. Next in <lb/>
            order follows parching heat, and in its company dusty Ceres and <lb/>
            the etesian blasts of the north winds. Next autumn advances and <lb/>
            Euhius Euan steps on together. Then other seasons and winds <lb/>
            follow, loud-roaring Volturnus and the southwind stored with <lb/>
            lightning. At last midwinter brings with it snows and gives back <lb/>
            benumbing cold; after it follows winter with teeth chattering with <lb/>
            cold. It is therefore the less strange that a moon is begotten at <lb/>
            a fixed time and at a fixed time is destroyed again, since many <lb/>
            things may take place at a time so surely fixed.</p>
          <p>The eclipses of the sun likewise and the obscurations of the <lb/>
            moon you may suppose to take place from many different causes. <lb/>
            For why should the moon be able to shut the earth out from the <lb/>
            sun's light and on the earthward side put in his way her high­ <lb/>
            exalted head, placing her dark orb before his burning rays; and <lb/>
            yet at the same time it be thought that another body gliding <lb/>
            on ever without light cannot do the same ? Why too should not <lb/>
            the sun be able, quite exhausted, to lose his fires at a fixed time, <lb/>
            and again reproduce his light when in his journey through the air <lb/>
            he has passed by spots fatal to his flames, which cause his fires to <lb/>
            be quenched and to perish ? And why should the earth be able <lb/>
            in turn to rob the moon of light and moreover herself to keep the <lb/>
            sun suppressed, while in her monthly course she glides through <lb/>
            the well-defined shadows of the cone; and yet at the same time <lb/>
            another body not be able to pass under the moon or glide above <lb/>
            the sun's orb, breaking off its rays and the light it sheds forth ? <lb/>
            Yes and if the moon shines with her own brightness, why should <lb/>
            she not be able to grow faint in a certain part of the world, while <lb/>
            she is passing through spots hostile to her own light ?</p>
          <p>And now further since I have explained in what way every <lb/>
            thing might take place throughout the blue of the great heaven; <lb/>
            how we might know what force and cause set in motion the <lb/>
            varied courses of the sun and wanderings of the moon; and in <lb/>
            what way their light might be intercepted and they be lost to <lb/>
            us and spread darkness over the earth little expecting it, when <pb n="135"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="778−818"/> <lb/>
            so to speak they close their eye of light and opening it again <lb/>
            survey all places shining in bright radiance, I now go back to <lb/>
            the infancy of the world and the tender age of the fields of earth <lb/>
            and shew what first in their early essays of production they re­ <lb/>
            solved to raise into the borders of light and give in charge to the <lb/>
            wayward winds.</p>
          <p>In the beginning the earth gave forth all kinds of herbage <lb/>
            and verdant sheen about the hills and over all the plains; the <lb/>
            flowery meadows glittered with the bright green hue, and next <lb/>
            in order to the different trees was given a strong and emulous <lb/>
            desire of growing up into the air with full unbridled powers. As <lb/>
            feathers and hairs and bristles are first born on the limbs of four­ <lb/>
            footed beasts and the body of the strong of wing, thus the new <lb/>
            earth then first put forth grass and bushes, and next gave birth <lb/>
            to the races of mortal creatures springing up many in number <lb/>
            in many ways after divers fashions. For no living creatures can <lb/>
            have dropped from heaven nor can those belonging to the land <lb/>
            have come out of the salt pools. It follows that with good reason <lb/>
            the earth has gotten the name of mother, since all things have <lb/>
            been produced out of the earth. And many living creatures even <lb/>
            now spring out of the earth taking form by rains and the heat <lb/>
            of the sun. It is therefore the less strange if at that time they <lb/>
            sprang up more in number and larger in size, having come to <lb/>
            maturity in the freshness of earth and ether. First of all the <lb/>
            race of fowls and the various birds would leave their eggs, hatched <lb/>
            in the springtime, just as now in summer the eicades leave spon­ <lb/>
            taneously their gossamer coats in quest of a living and life. Then <lb/>
            you must know did the earth first give forth races of mortal men. <lb/>
            For much heat and moisture would then abound in the fields; <lb/>
            and therefore wherever a suitable spot offered, wombs would grow <lb/>
            attached to the earth by roots; and when the warmth of the <lb/>
            infants, flying the wet and craving the air, had opened these in <lb/>
            the fulness of time, nature would turn to that spot the pores of <lb/>
            the earth and constrain it to yield from its opened veins a liquid <lb/>
            most like to milk, even as now-a-days every woman when she <lb/>
            has borne, is filled with sweet milk, because all that current of <lb/>
            nutriment streams towards the breasts. To the children the earth <lb/>
            would furnish food, the heat raiment, the grass a bed rich in <lb/>
            abundance of soft down. Then the fresh youth of the world <pb n="136"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="818−857"/> <lb/>
            would give forth neither severe colds nor excessive heats nor gales <lb/>
            of great violence; for all things grow and acquire strength in a <lb/>
            like proportion.</p>
          <p>Wherefore again and again I say the earth with good title <lb/>
            has gotten and keeps the name of mother, since she of herself <lb/>
            gave birth to mankind and at a time nearly fixed shed forth <lb/>
            every beast that ranges wildly over the great mountains, and at <lb/>
            the same time the fowls of the air with all their varied shapes. <lb/>
            But because she must have some limit set to her bearing, she <lb/>
            ceased like a woman worn out by length of days. For time <lb/>
            changes the nature of the whole world and all things must pass <lb/>
            on from one condition to another, and nothing continues like to <lb/>
            itself: all things quit their bounds, all things nature changes and <lb/>
            compels to alter. One thing crumbles away and is worn and en­ <lb/>
            feebled with age, then another comes unto honour and issues out <lb/>
            of its state of contempt. In this way then time changes the <lb/>
            nature of the whole world and the earth passes out of one con­ <lb/>
            dition into another: what once it could, it can bear no more, in <lb/>
            order to be able to bear what before it did not bear.</p>
          <p>And many monsters too the earth at that time essayed to <lb/>
            produce, things coming up with strange face and limbs, the man­ <lb/>
            woman, a thing between the two and neither the one sex nor <lb/>
            the other, widely differing from both ; some things deprived of <lb/>
            feet, others again destitute of hands, others too proving dumb <lb/>
            without mouth, or blind without eyes, and things bound fast by <lb/>
            the adhesion of their limbs over all the body, so that they could <lb/>
            not do anything nor go anywhere nor avoid the evil nor take what <lb/>
            their needs required. Every other monster and portent of this <lb/>
            kind she would produce, but all in vain, since nature set a ban <lb/>
            on their increase and they could not reach the coveted flower of <lb/>
            age nor find food nor be united in marriage. For we see that <lb/>
            many conditions must meet together in things in order that they <lb/>
            may beget and continue their kinds; first a supply of food, then <lb/>
            a way by which the birth-producing seeds throughout the frame <lb/>
            may stream from the relaxed limbs; also in order that the woman <lb/>
            may be united with the male, the possession of organs whereby <lb/>
            they may each interchange mutual joys.</p>
          <p>And many races of living things must then have died out and <lb/>
            been unable to beget and continue their breed. For in the case <pb n="137"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="857−896"/> <lb/>
            of all things which you see breathing the breath of life, either <lb/>
            craft or courage or else speed has from the beginning of its ex­ <lb/>
            istence protected and preserved each particular race. And there <lb/>
            are many things which, recommended to us by their useful ser­ <lb/>
            vices, continue to exist consigned to our protection. In the first <lb/>
            place the fierce breed of lions and the savage races their courage <lb/>
            has protected, foxes their craft and stags their proneness to flight. <lb/>
            But light-sleeping dogs with faithful heart in breast and every <lb/>
            kind which is born of the seed of beasts of burden and at the <lb/>
            same time the woolly flocks and the horned herds are all con­ <lb/>
            signed, Memmius, to the protection of man. For they have ever <lb/>
            fled with eagerness from wild beasts and have ensued peace and <lb/>
            plenty of food obtained without their own labour, as we give it <lb/>
            in requital of their useful services. But those to whom nature <lb/>
            has granted none of these qualities, so that they could neither live <lb/>
            by their own means nor perform for us any useful service in <lb/>
            return for which we should suffer their kind to feed and be <lb/>
            safe under our protection, those, you are to know, would lie <lb/>
            exposed as a prey and booty of others, hampered all in their own <lb/>
            death-bringing shackles, until nature brought that kind to utter <lb/>
            destruction.</p>
          <p>But Centaurs never have existed, and at no time can there <lb/>
            exist things of twofold nature and double body formed into one <lb/>
            frame out of limbs of alien kinds, such that the faculties and <lb/>
            powers of this and that portion cannot be sufficiently like. This <lb/>
            however dull of understanding you may learn from what follows. <lb/>
            To begin, a horse when three years have gone round is in the <lb/>
            prime of his vigour, far different the boy: often even at that age <lb/>
            he will call in his sleep for the milk of the breast. Afterwards <lb/>
            when in advanced age his lusty strength and limbs now faint with <lb/>
            ebbing life fail the horse, then and not till then youth in the <lb/>
            flower of age commences for that boy and clothes his cheeks in <lb/>
            soft down; that you may not haply believe that out of a man <lb/>
            and the burden-carrying seed of horses Centaurs can be formed <lb/>
            and have being; or that Scyllas with bodies half those of fishes <lb/>
            girdled round with raving dogs can exist, and all other things <lb/>
            of the kind, whose limbs we see cannot harmonize together; as <lb/>
            they neither come to their flower at the same time nor reach the <lb/>
            fulness of their bodily strength nor lose it in advanced old age, <pb n="138"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="897−939"/> <lb/>
            nor burn with similar passions nor have compatible manners, nor <lb/>
            feel the same things give pleasure throughout their frames. Thus <lb/>
            we may see bearded goats often fatten on hemlock which for man <lb/>
            is rank poison. Since flame moreover is wont to scorch and burn <lb/>
            the tawny bodies of lions just as much as any other kind of flesh <lb/>
            and blood existing on earth, how could it be that a single chimera <lb/>
            with triple body, in front a lion, behind a dragon, in the middle <lb/>
            the goat whose name it bears, could breathe out at the mouth <lb/>
            fierce flame from its body ? Wherefore also he who fables that in <lb/>
            the new time of the earth and the fresh youth of heaven such <lb/>
            living creatures could have been begotten, resting upon this one <lb/>
            futile term new, may babble out many things in like fashion, <lb/>
            may say that rivers then ran with gold over all parts of the <lb/>
            earth, and that trees were wont to blossom with precious stones, <lb/>
            or that man.was born with such giant force of frame that he could <lb/>
            wade on foot across deep seas and whirl the whole heaven about <lb/>
            him with his hands. For the fact that there were many seeds <lb/>
            of things in the earth what time it first shed forth living crea­ <lb/>
            tures, is yet no proof that there could have been produced beasts <lb/>
            of different kinds mixed together, and limbs of different living <lb/>
            things formed into a single frame, because the kinds of herbage <lb/>
            and corn and joyous trees which even now spring in plenty out <lb/>
            of the earth yet cannot be produced with the several sorts plaited <lb/>
            into one, but each thing goes on after its own fashion, and all <lb/>
            preserve their distinctive differences according to a fixed law of <lb/>
            nature.</p>
          <p>But the race of man then in the fields was much hardier, <lb/>
            as beseemed it to be, since the hard earth had produced it; and <lb/>
            built on a groundwork of larger and more solid bones within, <lb/>
            knit with powerful sinews throughout the frame of flesh; not <lb/>
            lightly to be disabled by heat or cold or strange kinds of food <lb/>
            or any malady of body. And during the revolution of many <lb/>
            lustres of the sun through heaven they led a life after the roving <lb/>
            fashion of wild beasts. No one then was a sturdy guider of <lb/>
            the bent plough or knew how to labour the fields with iron or <lb/>
            plant in the ground young saplings or lop with pruning-hooks old <lb/>
            boughs from the high trees. What the sun and rains had given, <lb/>
            what the earth had produced spontaneously, was guerdon suf­ <lb/>
            ficient to content their hearts. Among acorn-bearing oaks they <pb n="139"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="939−979"/> <lb/>
            would refresh their bodies for the most part; and the arbute- <lb/>
            berries which you now see in the winter-time ripen with a bright <lb/>
            scarlet hue, the earth would then bear in greatest plenty and <lb/>
            of a larger size; and many coarse kinds of food besides the <lb/>
            teeming freshness of the world then bare, more than enough <lb/>
            for poor wretched men. But rivers and springs invited to slake <lb/>
            thirst, even as now a rush of water down from the great hills <lb/>
            summons with clear plash far and wide the thirsty races of wild <lb/>
            beasts. Then too as they ranged about they would occupy the <lb/>
            well-known woodland haunts of the nymphs, out of which they <lb/>
            knew that smooth-gliding streams of water with a copious gush <lb/>
            bathed the dripping rocks, the dripping rocks, trickling down <lb/>
            over the green moss; and in parts welled and bubbled out over <lb/>
            the level plain. And as yet they knew not how to apply fire <lb/>
            to their purposes or to make use of skins and clothe their body in <lb/>
            the spoils of wild beasts, but they would dwell in woods and <lb/>
            mountain-caves and forests and shelter in the brushwood their <lb/>
            squalid limbs when driven to shun the buffeting of the winds <lb/>
            and the rains. And they were unable to look to the general <lb/>
            weal and knew not how to make a common use of any customs <lb/>
            or laws. Whatever prize fortune threw in his way, each man <lb/>
            would bear off, trained at his own discretion to think of himself <lb/>
            and live for himself alone. And Venus would join the bodies <lb/>
            of lovers in the woods; for each woman was gained over either <lb/>
            by mutual desire or the headstrong violence and vehement lust <lb/>
            of the man or a bribe of some acorns and arbute-berries or choice <lb/>
            pears. And trusting to the marvellous powers of their hands <lb/>
            and feet they would pursue the forest-haunting races of wild <lb/>
            beasts with showers of stones and club of ponderous weight; and <lb/>
            many they would conquer, a few they would avoid in hiding- <lb/>
            places; and like to bristly swine just as they were they would <lb/>
            throw their savage limbs all naked on the ground, when over­ <lb/>
            taken by night, covering themselves up with leaves and boughs. <lb/>
            Yet never with loud wailings would they call for the daylight <lb/>
            and the sun, wandering terror-stricken over the fields In the <lb/>
            shadows of night, but silent and buried in sleep they would wait, <lb/>
            till the sun with rosy torch carried light into heaven; for ac­ <lb/>
            customed as they had been from childhood always to see darkness <lb/>
            and light begotten time about, never could any wonder come <pb n="140"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="980−1020"/> <lb/>
            over them, nor any misgiving that never-ending night would cover <lb/>
            the earth and the light of the sun be withdrawn for evermore. <lb/>
            But what gave them trouble was rather the races of wild beasts <lb/>
            which would often render repose fatal to the poor wretches. And <lb/>
            driven from their home they would fly from their rocky shelters <lb/>
            on the approach of a foaming boar or a strong lion, and in the <lb/>
            dead of night they would surrender in terror to their savage guests <lb/>
            their sleeping-places strawn with leaves.</p>
          <p>Nor then much more than now would the races of mortal men <lb/>
            leave the sweet light of ebbing life. For then this one or that <lb/>
            other one of them would be more likely to be seized, and torn <lb/>
            open by their teeth would furnish to the wild beasts a living <lb/>
            food, and would fill with his moaning woods and mountains and <lb/>
            forests as he looked on his living flesh buried in a living grave. <lb/>
            But those whom flight had saved with body eaten into, holding <lb/>
            ever after their quivering palms over the noisome sores would <lb/>
            summon death with appalling cries, until cruel gripings had rid <lb/>
            them of life, forlorn of help, unwitting what wounds wanted. <lb/>
            But then a single day gave not over to death many thousands <lb/>
            of men marching with banners spread, nor did the stormy waters <lb/>
            of the sea dash on the rocks men and ships. At this time the sea <lb/>
            would often rise up and rage without aim, without purpose, <lb/>
            without result, and just as lightly put off its empty threats; nor <lb/>
            could the winning wiles of the calm sea treacherously entice any <lb/>
            one to his ruin with laughing waters, when the reckless craft of <lb/>
            the skipper had not yet risen into the light. Then too want of <lb/>
            food would consign to death their fainting frames, now on the <lb/>
            contrary 'tis plenty sinks into ruin. They unwittingly would <lb/>
            often pour out poison for themselves; now with nicer skill men <lb/>
            give it to their son's wife instead.</p>
          <p>Next after they had got themselves huts and skins and fire, <lb/>
            and the woman united with the man passed with him into one <lb/>
            [domicile and the duties of wedlock were] learnt [by the two], <lb/>
            and they saw an offspring born from them, then first mankind <lb/>
            began to soften. For fire made their chilled bodies less able now <lb/>
            to bear the frost beneath the canopy of heaven, and Venus im­ <lb/>
            paired their strength and children with their caresses soon broke <lb/>
            down the haughty temper of parents. Then too neighbours began <lb/>
            to join in a league of friendship mutually desiring neither to do <pb n="141"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="1020−1061"/> <lb/>
            nor suffer harm; and asked for indulgence to children and <lb/>
            womankind, when with cries and gestures they declared in stam­ <lb/>
            mering speech that meet it is for all to have mercy on the <lb/>
            weak. And though harmony could not be established without <lb/>
            exception, yet a very large portion observed their agreements <lb/>
            with good faith, or else the race of man would then have been <lb/>
            wholly cut off, nor could breeding have continued their genera­ <lb/>
            tions to this day.</p>
          <p>But nature impelled them to utter the various sounds of the <lb/>
            tongue and use struck out the names of things, much in the same <lb/>
            way as the inability to speak is seen in its turn to drive children <lb/>
            to the use of gestures, when it forces them to point with the <lb/>
            finger at the things which are before them. For every one feels <lb/>
            how far he can make use of his peculiar powers. Ere the horns <lb/>
            of a calf are formed and project from his forehead, he butts with <lb/>
            it when angry and pushes out in his rage. Then whelps of <lb/>
            panthers and cubs of lions fight with claws and feet and teeth <lb/>
            at a time when teeth and claws are hardly yet formed. Again <lb/>
            we see every kind of fowl trust to wings and seek from pinions a <lb/>
            fluttering succour. Therefore to suppose that some one man at <lb/>
            that time apportioned names to things and that men from him <lb/>
            learnt their first words, is sheer folly. For why should this parti­ <lb/>
            cular man be able to denote all things by words and to utter the <lb/>
            various sounds of the tongue, and yet at the same time others be <lb/>
            supposed not to have been able to do so ? Again if others as well <lb/>
            as he had not made use of words among themselves, whence was <lb/>
            implanted in this man the previous conception of its use and <lb/>
            whence was given to him the original faculty, to know and per­ <lb/>
            ceive in mind what he wanted to do ? Again one man could not <lb/>
            constrain and subdue and force many to choose to learn the <lb/>
            names of things. It is no easy thing in any way to teach and <lb/>
            convince the deaf of what is needful to be done; for they never <lb/>
            would suffer nor in any way endure sounds of voice hitherto <lb/>
            unheard to continue to be dinned fruitlessly into their ears. <lb/>
            Lastly what is there so passing strange in this circumstance, that <lb/>
            the race of men whose voice and tongue were in full force, should <lb/>
            denote things by different words as different feelings prompted ? <lb/>
            since dumb brutes, yes and the races of wild beasts are accus­ <lb/>
            tomed to give forth distinct and varied sounds, when they have <pb n="142"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="1061−1100"/> <lb/>
            fear or pain and when joys are rife. This yon may learn from <lb/>
            facts plain to sense : when the large spongy open lips of Molos­ <lb/>
            sian dogs begin to growl enraged and bare their hard teeth, thus <lb/>
            drawn back in rage they threaten in a tone far different from <lb/>
            that in which they bark outright and fill with sounds all the <lb/>
            places round. Again when they essay fondly to lick their whelps <lb/>
            with their tongue or when they toss them with their feet and <lb/>
            snapping at them make a feint with lightly closing teeth of <lb/>
            swallowing though with gentle forbearance, they caress them <lb/>
            with a yelping sound of a sort greatly differing from that which <lb/>
            they utter when left alone in a house they bay or when they <lb/>
            slink away howling from blows with a crouching body. Again is <lb/>
            not the neigh too seen to differ, when a young stallion in the <lb/>
            flower of age rages among the mares smitten by the goads of <lb/>
            winged love, and when with wide-stretched nostrils he snorts out <lb/>
            the signal to arms, and when as it chances on any other occasion <lb/>
            he neighs with limbs all shaking ? Lastly the race of fowls and <lb/>
            various birds, hawks and osprays and gulls seeking their living <lb/>
            in the salt water mid the waves of the sea, utter at a different <lb/>
            time noises widely different from those they make when they are <lb/>
            fighting for food and struggling with their prey. And some of <lb/>
            them change together with the weather their harsh croaking:-;, <lb/>
            as the long-lived races of crows and flocks of rooks when they <lb/>
            are said to be calling for water and rain and sometimes to be <lb/>
            summoning winds and gales. Therefore if different sensations <lb/>
            compel creatures, dumb though they be, to utter different sounds, <lb/>
            how much more natural it is that mortal men in those times should <lb/>
            have been able to denote dissimilar things by many different <lb/>
            words!</p>
          <p>And lest haply on this head you ask in silent thought this <lb/>
            question, it was lightning that brought fire down on earth for <lb/>
            mortals in the beginning; thence the whole heat of flames is <lb/>
            spread abroad. Thus we see many things shine dyed in heavenly <lb/>
            flames, when the stroke from heaven has stored them with its <lb/>
            heat. Ay and without this when a branching tree sways to and <lb/>
            fro and tosses about under the buffeting of the winds, pressing <lb/>
            against the boughs of another tree, fire is forced out by the power <lb/>
            of the violent friction, and sometimes the burning heat of flame <lb/>
            flashes out, the boughs and stems rubbing against each other. <lb/>
            <pb n="143"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="1101−1141"/><lb/>
            Now either of these accidents may have given fire to men. Next <lb/>
            the sun taught them to cook food and soften it with the heat of <lb/>
            flame, since they would see many things grow mellow, when sub­ <lb/>
            dued by the strokes of the rays and by heat throughout the land.</p>
          <p>And more and more every day men who excelled in intellect <lb/>
            and were of vigorous understanding, would kindly shew them how <lb/>
            to exchange their former way of living for new methods. Kings <lb/>
            began to build towns and lay out a citadel as a place of strength <lb/>
            and of refuge for themselves, and divided cattle and lands and <lb/>
            gave to each man in proportion to his personal beauty and strength <lb/>
            and intellect; for beauty and vigorous strength were much esteem­ <lb/>
            ed. Afterwards wealth was discovered and gold found out, which <lb/>
            soon robbed of their honours strong and beautiful alike; for men <lb/>
            however valiant and beautiful of person generally follow in the <lb/>
            train of the richer man. But were a man to order his life by the <lb/>
            rules of true reason, a frugal subsistence joined to a contented <lb/>
            mind is for him great riches; for never is there any lack of a <lb/>
            little. But men desired to be famous and powerful, in order that <lb/>
            their fortunes might rest on a firm foundation and they might be <lb/>
            able by their wealth to lead a tranquil life; but in vain, since in <lb/>
            their struggle to mount up to the highest dignities they rendered <lb/>
            their path one full of danger; and even if they reach it, yet envy <lb/>
            like a thunderbolt sometimes strikes and dashes men down from <lb/>
            the highest point with ignominy into noisome Tartarus; since the <lb/>
            highest summits and those elevated above the level of other things <lb/>
            I are mostly blasted by envy as by a thunderbolt; so that far better <lb/>
            it is to obey in peace and quiet than to wish to rule with power <lb/>
            supreme and be the master of kingdoms. Therefore let men wear <lb/>
            themselves out to no purpose and sweat drops of blood, as they <lb/>
            struggle on along the strait road of ambition, since they gather <lb/>
            their knowledge from the mouths of others and follow after things <lb/>
            from hearsay rather than the dictates of their own feelings; and <lb/>
            this prevails not now nor will prevail by and bye any more than it <lb/>
            has prevailed before.</p>
          <p>Kings therefore being slain the old majesty of thrones and <lb/>
            proud sceptres were overthrown and laid in the dust, and the <lb/>
            glorious badge of the sovereign head bloodstained beneath the feet <lb/>
            of the rabble mourned for its high prerogative; for that is greedily <lb/>
            trampled on which before was too much dreaded. It would come <lb/>
            <pb n="144"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="1141−1182"/><lb/>
            then in the end to the lees of uttermost disorder, each man seek­ <lb/>
            ing for himself empire and sovereignty. Next a portion of them <lb/>
            taught men to elect legal officers, and drew up codes, to induce <lb/>
            men to obey the laws. For mankind, tired out with a life of <lb/>
            brute force, lay exhausted from its feuds; and therefore the more <lb/>
            readily it submitted of its own freewill to laws and stringent <lb/>
            codes. For as each one moved by anger took measures to avenge <lb/>
            himself with more severity than is now permitted by equitably <lb/>
            laws, for this reason men grew sick of a life of brute force. Thence <lb/>
            fear of punishment mars the prizes of life; for violence and wrong <lb/>
            enclose all who commit them in their meshes and do mostly recoil <lb/>
            on him from whom they began ; and it is not easy for him who by <lb/>
            his deeds transgresses the terms of the public peace to pass a tran­ <lb/>
            quil and a peaceful existence. For though he eludes God and <lb/>
            man, yet he cannot but feel a misgiving that his secret can be <lb/>
            kept for ever; seeing that many by speaking in their dreams <lb/>
            or in the wanderings of disease have often we are told betrayed <lb/>
            themselves and have disclosed their hidden deeds of evil and <lb/>
            their sins.</p>
          <p>And now what cause has spread over great nations the wor­ <lb/>
            ship of the. divinities of the gods and filled towns with altars and <lb/>
            led to the performance of stated sacred rites, rites now in fashion <lb/>
            on solemn occasions and in solemn places, from which even now <lb/>
            is implanted in mortals a shuddering awe which raises new tem­ <lb/>
            ples of the gods over the whole earth and prompts men to crowd <lb/>
            them on festive days, all this it is not so difficult to explain in <lb/>
            words. Even then in sooth the races of mortal men would see <lb/>
            in waking mind glorious forms, would see them in sleep of yet <lb/>
            more marvellous size of body. To these then they would attribute <lb/>
            sense, because they seemed to move their limbs and to utter lofty <lb/>
            words suitable to their glorious aspect and surpassing powers. <lb/>
            And they would give them life everlasting, because their face <lb/>
            would ever appear before them and their form abide ; yes and yet <lb/>
            without all this, because they would not believe that beings pos­ <lb/>
            sessed of such powers could lightly be overcome by any force. <lb/>
            And they would believe them to be preeminent in bliss, because <lb/>
            none of them was ever troubled with the fear of death, and be­ <lb/>
            cause at the same time in sleep they would see them perform <lb/>
            many miracles, yet feel on their part no fatigue from the effort. <pb n="145"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="1183−1226"/> <lb/>
            Again they would see the system of heaven and the different <lb/>
            seasons of the years come round in regular succession, and could <lb/>
            not find out by what causes this was done; therefore they would <lb/>
            seek a refuge in handing over all things to the gods and supposing v <lb/>
            all things to be guided by their nod. And they placed in heaven <lb/>
            the abodes and realms of the gods, because night and moon are <lb/>
            seen to roll through heaven, moon day and night and night's <lb/>
            austere constellations and night-wandering meteors of the sky and <lb/>
            flying bodies of flame, clouds sun rains snow winds lightnings hail <lb/>
            and rapid rumblings and loud threatful thunderclaps.</p>
          <p>0 hapless race of men, when that they charged the gods with <lb/>
            such acts and coupled with them bitter wrath ! what groanings <lb/>
            did they then beget for themselves, what wounds for us, what <lb/>
            tears for our children's children ! No act is it of piety to be often <lb/>
            seen with veiled head to turn to a stone and approach every altar <lb/>
            and fall prostrate on the ground and spread out the palms before <lb/>
            the statues of the gods and sprinkle the altars with much blood of <lb/>
            beasts and link vow on to vow, but rather to be able to look on <lb/>
            all things with a mind at peace. For when we turn our gaze on <lb/>
            the heavenly quarters of the great upper world and ether fast <lb/>
            above the glittering stars, and direct our thoughts to the courses <lb/>
            of the sun and moon, then into our breasts burdened with other <lb/>
            ills that fear as well begins to exalt its reawakened head, the fear <lb/>
            that we may haply find the power of the gods to be unlimited, <lb/>
            able to wheel the bright stars in their varied motion ; for lack of <lb/>
            power to solve the question troubles the mind with doubts, whe­ <lb/>
            ther there was ever a birth-time of the world, and whether like­ <lb/>
            wise there is to be any end; how far the walls of the world can <lb/>
            endure this strain of restless motion; or whether gifted by the <lb/>
            grace of the gods with an everlasting existence they may glide on <lb/>
            through a never-ending tract of time and defy the strong powers <lb/>
            of immeasurable ages. Again who is there whose mind does not <lb/>
            shrink -into with fear of the gods, whose limbs do not cower <lb/>
            in terror, when the parched earth rocks with the appalling thun­ <lb/>
            derstroke and rattlings run through the great heaven ? Do not <lb/>
            peoples and nations quake, and proud monarchs shrink into them­ <lb/>
            selves smitten with fear of the gods, lest -for any foul trans­ <lb/>
            gression or overweening word the heavy time of reckoning has <lb/>
            arrived at its fulness ? When too the utmost fury of the head- <note type="footnote"> M. III. </note> <note type="footnote"> K </note> <lb/>

            strong wind passes over the sea and sweeps over its waters the <lb/>
            commander of a fleet together with his mighty legions and ele­ <lb/>
            phants, does he not draw near with vows to seek the mercy of <lb/>
            the gods and ask in prayer with fear and trembling a lull in the <lb/>
            winds and propitious gales ; but all in vain; since often caught up <lb/>
            in the furious hurricane he is borne none the less to the shoals of <lb/>
            death ? so constantly does some hidden power trample on human <lb/>
            grandeur and is seen to tread under its heel and make sport for <lb/>
            itself of the renowned rods and cruel axes- Again when the <lb/>
            whole earth rocks under their feet and towns tumble with the <lb/>
            shock or doubtfully threaten to fall, what wonder that mortal men <lb/>
            abase themselves and make over to the gods in things here on <lb/>
            earth high prerogatives and marvellous powers, sufficient to govern <lb/>
            all things ?</p>
          <p>To proceed, copper and gold and iron were discovered and at <lb/>
            the same time weighty silver and the substance of lead, when <lb/>
            fire with its heat had burnt up vast forests on the great hills, <lb/>
            either by a discharge of heaven's lightning, or else because men <lb/>
            waging with one another a forest-war had carried fire among the <lb/>
            enemy in order to strike terror, or because drawn on by the good­ <lb/>
            ness of the soil they would wish to clear rich fields and bring the <lb/>
            country into pasture, or else to destroy wild beasts and enrich <lb/>
            themselves with the booty; for hunting with the pitfall and with <lb/>
            fire came into use before the practice of enclosing the lawn with <lb/>
            toils and stirring it with dogs. Whatever the fact is, from what­ <lb/>
            ever cause the heat of flame had swallowed up the forests with a <lb/>
            frightful crackling from their very roots and had thoroughly baked <lb/>
            the earth with fire, there would run from the boiling veins and <lb/>
            collect into the hollows of the ground a stream of silver and gold, <lb/>
            as well as of copper and lead. And when they saw these after­ <lb/>
            wards cool into lumps and glitter on the earth with a brilliant <lb/>
            gleam, they would lift them up attracted by the bright and polish­ <lb/>
            ed lustre, and they would see them to be moulded in a shape the <lb/>
            same as the outline of the cavities in which each lay. Then it <lb/>
            would strike them that these might be melted by heat and cast <lb/>
            in any form or shape soever, and might by hammering out be <lb/>
            brought to tapering points of any degree of sharpness and fineness, <lb/>
            so as to furnish them with tools and enable them to cut the forests <lb/>
            and hew timber and plane smooth the planks, and also to drill and <pb n="147"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="1268−1309"/> <lb/>
            pierce and bore. And they would set about these works just <lb/>
            as much with silver and gold at first as with the overpowering <lb/>
            strength of stout copper, but in vain, since their force would <lb/>
            fail and give way and not be able like copper to stand the severe <lb/>
            strain. At that time copper was in higher esteem and gold would <lb/>
            lie neglected on account of its uselessness, with its dull blunted <lb/>
            edge: now copper lies neglected, gold has mounted up to the <lb/>
            highest place of honour. Thus time as it goes round changes the <lb/>
            seasons of things. That which was in esteem, falls at length into <lb/>
            utter disrepute; and then another thing mounts up and issues out <lb/>
            of its degraded state and every day is more and more coveted and <lb/>
            blossoms forth high in honour when discovered and is in mar­ <lb/>
            vellous repute with men.</p>
          <p>And now, Memmius, it is easy for you to find out by your­ <lb/>
            self in what way the nature of iron was discovered. Arms of <lb/>
            old were hands nails and teeth and stones and boughs broken <lb/>
            off from the forests, and flame and fire, as soon as they had be­ <lb/>
            come known. Afterwards the force of iron and copper was dis­ <lb/>
            covered; and the use of copper was known before that of iron, <lb/>
            as its nature is easier to work and it is found in greater quan­ <lb/>
            tity. With copper they would labour the soil of the earth, with <lb/>
            copper stir up the billows of war and deal about wide-gaping <lb/>
            wounds and seize cattle and lands; for every thing defenceless <lb/>
            and unarmed would readily yield to them with arms in hand. <lb/>
            Then by slow steps the sword of iron gained ground and the <lb/>
            make of the copper sickle became a byword ; and with iron they <lb/>
            began to plough through the earth's soil, and the struggles of <lb/>
            wavering war were rendered equal. And the custom of mounting <lb/>
            in arms on the back of a horse and guiding him with reins and <lb/>
            shewing prowess with the right hand is older than that of tempt­ <lb/>
            ing the risks of war in a two-horsed chariot; and yoking a pair <lb/>
            of horses is older than yoking four or mounting in arms scythed <lb/>
            chariots. Next the Poeni taught the lucan kine with towered <lb/>
            body, hideous of aspect, with snake-like hand, to endure the <lb/>
            wounds of war and to disorder the mighty ranks of Mars. Thus <lb/>
            sad discord begat one thing after another, to affright nations of <lb/>
            men under arms, and every day made some addition to the terrors <lb/>

            sayed to send savage boars against the enemy. And some sent <lb/>
            before them valorous lions with armed trainers and courageous <lb/>
            keepers to guide them and to hold them in chains ; but in vain, <lb/>
            since heated with promiscuous slaughter they would disorder in <lb/>
            their rage the troops without distinction, shaking all about the <lb/>
            frightful crests upon their heads ; and the horsemen were not able <lb/>
            to calm the breasts of the horses scared by the roaring and turn <lb/>
            them with the bridle upon the enemy. The lionesses with a <lb/>
            spring would throw their enraged bodies on all sides and would <lb/>
            attack in the face those who met them, and others off their guard <lb/>
            they would tear down from behind and twining round them would <lb/>
            bring them to the ground overpowered by the wound, fastening <lb/>
            on them with firm bite and with hooked claws. The bulls would <lb/>
            toss their own friends and trample them under foot, and gore with <lb/>
            their horns the flanks and bellies of the horses underneath and <lb/>
            turn up the earth with threatening front. The boars too would <lb/>
            rend their friends with powerful tusks, in their rage dying with <lb/>
            their blood the weapons broken in them, ay dying with their <lb/>
            blood the weapons broken in their own bodies; and would put to <lb/>
            promiscuous rout horse and foot; for the tame beasts would try <lb/>
            to avoid by shying to the side the cruel push of the tusk, or would <lb/>
            rear up and paw the winds, all in vain, since you might see them <lb/>
            tumble down with their tendons severed and straw the ground in <lb/>
            their heavy fall. Those whom they believed before to have been <lb/>
            sufficiently broken in at home,, they would see lash themselves <lb/>
            into fury in the heat of action from wounds and shouting, flight <lb/>
            panic and uproar; and they could not rally any portion of them; <lb/>
            for all the different kinds of wild beasts would fly all abroad; <lb/>
            just as now the lucan kine when cruelly mangled by the steel <lb/>
            fly often all abroad, after inflicting on their friends many cruel <lb/>
            sufferings. But men chose thus to act not so much in any hope <lb/>
            of victory, as from a wish to give the enemy something to rue at <lb/>
            the cost of their own lives, when they mistrusted their numbers <lb/>
            and were in want of arms.</p>
          <p>A garment tied on the body was in use before a dress of <lb/>
            woven stuff. Woven stuff comes after iron, because iron is needed <lb/>
            for weaving a web ; and in no other way can such finely polished <lb/>
            things be made, as heddles and spindles, shuttles and ringing <lb/>
            yarn-beams. And nature impelled men to work up the wool <pb n="149"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="1354−1399"/> <lb/>
            before womankind: for the male sex in general far excels the <lb/>
            other in skill and is much more ingenious : until the rugged coun­ <lb/>
            trymen so upbraided them with it, that they were glad to give it <lb/>
            over into the hands of the women and take their share in support­ <lb/>
            ing hard toil, and in such hard work hardened body and hands.</p>
          <p>But nature parent of things was herself the first model of <lb/>
            sowing and first gave rise to grafting, since berries and acorns <lb/>
            dropping from the trees would put forth in due season swarms <lb/>
            of young shoots underneath; and hence also came the fashion <lb/>
            of inserting grafts in their stocks and planting in the ground <lb/>
            young saplings over the fields. Next they would try another <lb/>
            and yet another kind of tillage for their loved piece of land and <lb/>
            would see the earth better the wild fruits through genial fos­ <lb/>
            tering and kindly cultivation. And they would force the forests <lb/>
            to recede every day higher and higher up the hill-side and <lb/>
            yield the ground below to tilth, in order to have on the up­ <lb/>
            lands and plains meadows tanks runnels cornfields and glad <lb/>
            vineyards, and allow a grey-green strip of olives to run between <lb/>
            and mark the divisions, spreading itself over hillocks and valleys <lb/>
            and plains; just as you now see richly dight with varied beauty all <lb/>
            the ground which they lay out and plant with rows of sweet fruit- <lb/>
            trees and enclose all round with plantations of other goodly trees.</p>
          <p>But imitating with the mouth the clear notes of birds was <lb/>
            in use long before men were able to sing in tune smooth-running <lb/>
            verses and give pleasure to the ear. And the whistlings of the <lb/>
            zephyr through the hollows of reeds first taught peasants to blow <lb/>
            into hollow stalks. Then step by step they learned sweet plain­ <lb/>
            tive ditties, which the pipe pours forth pressed by the fingers of <lb/>
            the players, heard through pathless woods and forests and lawns, <lb/>
            through the unfrequented haunts of shepherds and abodes of <lb/>
            unearthly calm. These things would soothe and gratify their <lb/>
            minds when sated with food; for then all things of this kind <lb/>
            are welcome. Often therefore stretched in groups on the soft <lb/>
            grass beside a stream of water under the boughs of a high tree <lb/>
            at no great cost they would pleasantly refresh their bodies, above <lb/>
            all when the weather smiled and the seasons of the year painted <lb/>
            the green grass with flowers. Then went round the jest, the <lb/>
            tale, the peals of merry laughter; for the peasant muse was <lb/>
            then in its glory; then frolick mirth would prompt to entwine <pb n="150"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="1399−1439"/> <lb/>
            head and shoulders with garlands plaited with flowers and leaves, <lb/>
            and to advance in the dance out of step and move the limbs <lb/>
            clumsily and with clumsy foot beat mother earth ; which would <lb/>
            occasion smiles and peals of merry laughter, because all these <lb/>
            things then from their greater novelty and strangeness were in <lb/>
            high repute. And the wakeful found a solace for want of sleep <lb/>
            in this, in drawing out a variety of notes and going through <lb/>
            tunes and running over the reeds with curving lip; whence <lb/>
            even at the present day watchmen observe these traditions and <lb/>
            have lately learned to keep the proper tune; and yet for all this <lb/>
            receive not a jot more of enjoyment, than erst the rugged race of <lb/>
            sons of earth received. For that which we have in our hands, if <lb/>
            we have known before nothing pleasanter, pleases above all and is <lb/>
            thought to be the best; and as a rule the later discovery of some­ <lb/>
            thing better spoils the taste for the former things and changes <lb/>
            the feelings in regard to all that has gone before. Thus began <lb/>
            distaste for the acorn, thus were abandoned those sleeping-places <lb/>
            strawn with grass and enriched with leaves. The dress too of <lb/>
            wild beasts' skin fell into neglect; though I can fancy that in <lb/>
            those days it was found to arouse such jealousy that he who first <lb/>
            wore it met his death by an ambuscade, and after all it was torn <lb/>
            in pieces among them and drenched in blood was utterly de­ <lb/>
            stroyed and could not be turned to any use. In those times there­ <lb/>
            fore skins, now gold and purple plague men's lives with cares <lb/>
            and wear them out with war. And in this methinks the greater <lb/>
            blame rests with us; for cold would torture the naked sons of <lb/>
            earth without their skins; but us it harms not in the least to do <lb/>
            without a robe of purple, spangled with gold and large figures, if <lb/>
            only we have a dress of the people to protect us. Mankind there­ <lb/>
            fore ever toils vainly and to no purpose and wastes life in ground­ <lb/>
            less cares, because sure enough they have not learnt what is the <lb/>
            true end of getting and up to what point genuine pleasure goes on <lb/>
            increasing: this by slow degrees has carried life out into the deep <lb/>
            sea and stirred up from their lowest depths the mighty billows <lb/>
            of war.</p>
          <p>But those watchful guardians sun and moon traversing with <lb/>
            their light all round the great revolving sphere of heaven taught <lb/>
            men that the seasons of the year came round and that the system <lb/>
            was carried on after a fixed plan and fixed order.</p><pb n="151"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="1440−1457"/> Already they would pass their life fenced about with strong <lb/>
            towers, and the land, portioned out and marked off by boundaries, <lb/>
            be tilled; the sea would be filled with ships scudding under sail; <lb/>
            towns have auxiliaries and allies as stipulated by treaty, when <lb/>
            poets began to consign the deeds of men to verse; and letters <lb/>
            had not been invented long before. For this reason our age can­ <lb/>
            not look back to what has gone before, save where reason points <lb/>
            out any traces.</p>
          <p>Ships and tillage, walls laws arms roads dress and all such <lb/>
            like things, all the prizes, all the elegancies too of life without <lb/>
            exception, poems pictures and the chiselling of fine-wrought <lb/>
            statues, all these things practice together with the acquired know­ <lb/>
            ledge of the untiring mind taught men by slow degrees as they <lb/>
            advanced on the way step by step. Thus time by degrees brings <lb/>
            each several thing forth before men's eyes and reason raises it up <lb/>
            into the borders of light; for things must be brought to light one <lb/>
            after the other and in due order in the different arts, until these <lb/>
            have reached their highest point of development.</p><pb n="152"/>

          </head>
          <p>In days of yore Athens of famous name first imparted corn-pro­ <lb/>
            ducing crops to suffering mankind, and modelled life anew and <lb/>
            passed laws; and first too bestowed sweet solaces of existence, <lb/>
            when she gave birth to a man who shewed himself gifted with <lb/>
            such a genius and poured forth all knowledge of old from his <lb/>
            truth-telling mouth ; whose glory, even now that he is dead, on <lb/>
            account of his godlike discoveries confirmed by length of time <lb/>
            is spread abroad among men and reaches high as heaven. For <lb/>
            when he saw that the things which their needs imperiously de­ <lb/>
            mand for subsistence, had all without exception been already pro­ <lb/>
            vided for men, and that life, so far as was possible, was placed on <lb/>
            a sure footing, that men were great in affluence of riches and <lb/>
            honours and glory and swelled with pride in the high reputation <lb/>
            of their children, and yet that none of them at home for all that <lb/>
            had a heart the less disquieted, and that this heart in despite of <lb/>
            the understanding plagued life without any respite and was con­ <lb/>
            strained to rave with distressful complainings, he then perceived <lb/>
            that the vessel itself did cause the corruption and that by its <lb/>
            corruption all the things that came into it and were gathered <lb/>
            from abroad, however salutary were spoilt within it; partly <lb/>
            because he saw it to be leaky and full of holes so that it could <lb/>
            never by any means be filled full; partly because he perceived <lb/>
            that it befouled so to say with a nauseous flavour everything <lb/>
            within it, which it had taken in. He therefore cleansed men's <lb/>
            breasts with truth-telling precepts and fixed a limit to lust and <lb/>
            fear and explained what was the chief good which we all strive to <lb/>
            reach, and pointed out the road along which by a short cross- <pb n="153"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="27−67"/> <lb/>
            track we might arrive at it in a straightforward course; he <lb/>
            shewed too what evils existed in mortal affairs throughout, rising <lb/>
            up and manifoldly flying about by a natural-call it chance or <lb/>
            force, because nature had so brought it about; and from what <lb/>
            gates you must sally out duly to encounter each; and he proved <lb/>
            that mankind mostly without cause arouse in their breast the <lb/>
            melancholy tumbling billows of cares. For even as children are <lb/>
            flurried and dread all things in the thick darkness, thus we in the <lb/>
            daylight fear at times things not a whit more to be dreaded than <lb/>
            what children shudder at in the dark and fancy sure to be. This <lb/>
            terror therefore and darkness of mind must be dispelled not by the <lb/>
            rays of the sun and glittering shafts of day, but by the aspect and <lb/>
            law of nature. Wherefore the more readily I will go on in my <lb/>
            verses to complete the web of my design.</p>
          <p>And since I have shewn that the quarters of ether are mortal <lb/>
            and that heaven is formed of a body that had a birth, and since of <lb/>
            all the things which go on and must go on in it, I have unravelled <lb/>
            most, hear further what remains to be told; since once for all [I <lb/>
            have willed] to mount the illustrious chariot [of the muses, and <lb/>
            ascending to heaven to explain the true law of winds and storms, <lb/>
            which men foolishly lay to the charge of the gods, telling how, <lb/>
            when they are angry, they raise fierce tempests; and, when there <lb/>
            is a lull in the fury] of the winds, how that anger is appeased, how <lb/>
            the omens which have been are again changed, when their fury <lb/>
            has thus been appeased: [I have willed at the same time] to <lb/>
            explain all the other things which mortals observe to go on upon <lb/>
            earth and in heaven, when often they are in anxious suspense of <lb/>
            mind, and which abase their souls with fear of the gods and weigh <lb/>
            and press them down to earth, because ignorance of the causes <lb/>
            constrains them to submit things to the empire of the gods and <lb/>
            to make over to them the kingdom. For they who have been <lb/>
            rightly taught that the gods lead a life without care, if never­ <lb/>
            theless they wonder on what plan all things can be carried on, <lb/>
            above all in regard to those things which are seen overhead in the <lb/>
            ethereal borders, are borne back again into their old religious <lb/>
            scruples and take unto themselves hard taskmasters, whom they <lb/>
            poor wretches believe to be almighty, not knowing what can, <lb/>
            what cannot be, in short on what principle each thing has its <lb/>
            powers defined, its deep-set boundary mark; and therefore they <pb n="154"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="67−108"/> <lb/>
            are led all the farther astray by blind reason. Now unless you <lb/>
            drive from your mind with loathing all these things, and banish <lb/>
            far from you all belief in things degrading to the gods and incon­ <lb/>
            sistent with their peace, then often will the holy deities of the <lb/>
            gods, having their majesty lessened by you, do you hurt; not <lb/>
            that the supreme power of the gods can be so outraged, that in <lb/>
            their wrath they shall resolve to exact sharp vengeance, but <lb/>
            because you will fancy to yourself that they, though they enjoy <lb/>
            quiet and calm peace, do roll great billows of wrath; nor will you <lb/>
            approach the sanctuaries of the gods with a calm breast nor will <lb/>
            you be able with tranquil peace of mind to take in those idols <lb/>
            which are carried from their holy body into the minds of men, as <lb/>
            heralds of their divine form. And what kind of life follows after <lb/>
            this, may be conceived. But in order that most veracious reason <lb/>
            may drive it far away from us, though much has already gone forth <lb/>
            from me, much however still remains and has to be embellished <lb/>
            in smooth-polished verses; the law and aspect of heaven have to <lb/>
            be grasped ; storms and bright lightnings, what they do and from <lb/>
            what cause they are borne along, all this has to be sung; that you <lb/>
            may not mark out the heaven into quarters and be startled and <lb/>
            distracted on seeing from which of them the volant fire has come <lb/>
            or to which of the two halves it has betaken itself, in what way it <lb/>
            has gained an entrance within walled places, and how after <lb/>
            lording it with tyrant sway, it has gotten itself out from these. <lb/>
            Do thou, deft muse Calliope, solace of men and joy of gods, point <lb/>
            out the course -before me as I race to the white boundary-line <lb/>
            of the final goal, that under thy guidance I may win the crown <lb/>
            with signal applause.</p>
          <p>In the first place the blue of heaven is shaken with thunder, <lb/>
            because the ethereal clouds clash together as they fly aloft when <lb/>
            the winds combat from opposite quarters. For no sound ever <lb/>
            comes from a cloudless part of heaven, but wheresoever the clouds <lb/>
            are gathered in a denser mass, from that part with greater fre­ <lb/>
            quency comes a clap with a loud growl. Again clouds cannot be <lb/>
            either of so dense a body as stones and timbers, nor again so fine <lb/>
            as mists and flying bodies of smoke; for then they must either <lb/>
            fall borne down by their dead weight like stones, or like smoke <lb/>
            they would be unable to keep together and hold within frozen <lb/>
            snows and hail-showers. They also give forth a sound over the <pb n="155"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="108−146"/> <lb/>
            levels of the wide-stretching upper world, just as at times a can­ <lb/>
            vas-awning stretched over large theatres makes a creaking noise, <lb/>
            when it tosses about among the poles and beams; sometimes too <lb/>
            rent by the boisterous gales it madly howls and closely imitates <lb/>
            the rasping noise of pieces of paper: for this kind of noise too <lb/>
            you may observe in thunder: you may observe again the sound <lb/>
            which is heard when the winds whirl about with their blows <lb/>
            and buffet through the air either a hanging cloth or flying bits <lb/>
            of paper. For sometimes the clouds cannot meet front to front <lb/>
            in direct collision, but must rather move from the flank and so <lb/>
            with contrary motions graze leisurely along each other's bodies; <lb/>
            whence comes that dry sound which brushes the ears and is long <lb/>
            drawn out, until they have made their way out of their confined <lb/>
            positions.</p>
          <p>In this way also all things appear to quake often from the <lb/>
            shock of heavy thunder, and the mighty walls of the farstretching <lb/>
            ether seem in an instant to have been riven and to have sprung <lb/>
            asunder; when a storm of violent wind has suddenly gathered and <lb/>
            worked itself into the clouds and, there shut in, with its whirling <lb/>
            eddy ever more and more on all sides forces the cloud to become <lb/>
            hollow with a thick surrounding crust of body; afterwards when <lb/>
            its force and impetuous onset have split it, then the cloud thus <lb/>
            rent gives forth a crash with a frightful hurtling noise. And no <lb/>
            wonder, when a small bladder filled with air often emits a hideous <lb/>
            sound if suddenly burst.</p>
          <p>It can also be explained how the winds, when they blow <lb/>
            through the clouds, make noises: we see branching and rough <lb/>
            clouds often borne along in many ways; thus, you are to know, <lb/>
            when the blasts of the northwest blow through a dense forest, the <lb/>
            leaves give forth a rustling and the boughs a crashing. Some­ <lb/>
            times too the force of the strong wind in rapid motion rends the <lb/>
            cloud, breaking through it by an assault right in front: what a <lb/>
            blast of wind can do there, is shewn by facts plain to sense, when <lb/>
            here on earth where it is gentler it yet twists out tall trees and <lb/>
            tears them up from their deepest roots. There are also waves <lb/>
            among the clouds and they give a kind of roar as they break <lb/>
            heavily; just as in deep rivers and on the great sea when the <lb/>
            surf breaks. Sometimes too when the burning force of thunder <lb/>
            has fallen out of one cloud into another, if haply the latter con­ <lb/>
            <pb n="156"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="146—185"/>tains much moisture when it has taken the fire into it, it drowns <lb/>
            it at once with a loud noise; just so iron glowing hot from the <lb/>
            fiery furnaces sometimes hisses, when we have plunged it quickly <lb/>
            into cold water. Again if the cloud which receives the fire is <lb/>
            drier, it is set on fire in an instant and burns with a loud noise ; <lb/>
            just as if a flame should range over the laurel-covered hills through <lb/>
            a whirlwind and burn them up with its impetuous assault; and <lb/>
            there is not anything that burns in the crackling flame with a <lb/>
            more startling sound than the Delphic laurel of Phoebus. Then <lb/>
            often too much crashing of ice and tumbling in of hail make a <lb/>
            noise in the great clouds on high; for when the wind packs them <lb/>
            together into a confined space, the mountains of storm-clouds <lb/>
            congealed and mixed with hail break up.</p>
          <p>It lightens too, when the clouds have struck out by their col­ <lb/>
            lision many seeds of fire; just as if a stone were to strike another <lb/>
            stone or a piece of iron; for then too light bursts out and fire <lb/>
            scatters about bright sparks. But we hear the thunder with <lb/>
            our ears after the eyes see the flash of lightning, because things <lb/>
            always travel more slowly to the ears than those which excite <lb/>
            vision travel to the eyes. This you may perceive from the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing instance as well: when you see a man at a distance <lb/>
            cutting with a double-edged axe a large tree, you perceive the <lb/>
            stroke before the blow carries the sound to the ear: thus we see <lb/>
            lightning too before we hear the thunder, which is discharged at <lb/>
            the same time as the fire from the same cause, being born indeed <lb/>
            from the same collision.</p>
          <p>Also in the following manner clouds dye places with winged <lb/>
            light and the storm flashes out with a rapid quivering movement. <lb/>
            When the wind has made its way into a cloud and whirling about <lb/>
            in it has, as I have shewn above, made the cloud hollow with a <lb/>
            dense crust, it becomes hot by its own velocity: thus you see <lb/>
            all things thoroughly heated and fired by motion; nay a leaden <lb/>
            ball in whirling through a long course even melts. When there­ <lb/>
            fore this wind now on fire has rent the black cloud, it scatters <lb/>
            abroad at once seeds of fire pressed out by force so to speak, and <lb/>
            these produce the throbbing flashes of flame; then follows a <lb/>
            sound which strikes on the ears more slowly than the things <lb/>
            which travel to our eyes strike on them. This you are to know <lb/>
            takes place when the clouds are dense and at the same time <lb/>
            <pb n="157"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="185—227"/>piled up oil high one above the other in marvellous accumu­ <lb/>
            lation ; that you be not led into error, because we see how great <lb/>
            their breadth is below, rather than to how great a height they <lb/>
            are piled up. Observe, at a time when the winds shall carry <lb/>
            clouds like to mountains with a slanting course through the air, <lb/>
            or when you shall see them piled on the sides of great moun­ <lb/>
            tains one on the top of the other and pressing down from above <lb/>
            perfectly at rest, the winds being buried on all sides: you will <lb/>
            then be able to observe their great masses and to see caverns as <lb/>
            it were built of hanging rocks; and when a storm has gathered <lb/>
            and the winds have filled these, they chafe with a loud roaring <lb/>
            shut up in the clouds, and bluster in their dens after the fashion <lb/>
            of wild beasts: now irom this point, now from that the winds <lb/>
            send their growlings through the clouds, and seeking a way out <lb/>
            whirl about and roll together seeds of fire out of the clouds and <lb/>
            then gather many into a mass and make flame rotate in the hol­ <lb/>
            low furnaces within, until they have burst the cloud and shone <lb/>
            forth in forked flashes.</p>
          <p>From this cause again yon golden colour of clear bright fire <lb/>
            flies down with velocity to the earth : the clouds must themselves <lb/>
            have very many seeds of fire; for when they are without any <lb/>
            moisture, they are mostly of a brilliant flame colour. Moreover <lb/>
            they must take in many from the sun's light, so that with good <lb/>
            cause they are ruddy and shed forth fires. When therefore the <lb/>
            wind has driven thrust squeezed together and collected into one <lb/>
            spot these clouds, they press out and shed forth seeds which cause <lb/>
            the colours of flame to flash out. It also lightens, when the clouds <lb/>
            of heaven are rarefied as well. For when the wind lightly unravels <lb/>
            them and breaks them up as they move, those seeds which produce <lb/>
            the lightning must fall perforce; and then it lightens without a <lb/>
            hideous startling noise and without any uproar.</p>
          <p>Well, to proceed, what kind of nature thunderbolts possess, is <lb/>
            shewn by their strokes and the traces of their heat which have <lb/>
            burnt themselves into things and the marks which exhale the <lb/>
            noxious vapours of sulphur: all these are signs of fire, not of wind <lb/>
            or rain. Again they often set on fire even the roofs of houses and <lb/>
            with swift flame rule resistless within the house. This fire subtle <lb/>
            above all fires nature, you are to know, forms of minute and lightly <lb/>
            moving bodies, and it is such as nothing whatever can withstand. <lb/>
            <pb n="158"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="228—270"/>The mighty thunderbolt passes through the walls of houses, like a <lb/>
            shout and voices, passes through stones, through brass, and in <lb/>
            a moment of time melts brass and gold; and causes wine too in an <lb/>
            instant to disappear, while the vessels are untouched, because sure <lb/>
            enough its heat on reaching it readily loosens and rarefies all the <lb/>
            earthen material of the vessel on every side and forcing a way <lb/>
            within lightly separates and disperses the first-beginnings of the <lb/>
            wine. This the sun's heat would be unable to accomplish in an <lb/>
            age, though beating on it incessantly with its quivering heat: so <lb/>
            much more nimble and overpowering is this other force.</p>
          <p>And now in what way these are begotten and are formed with <lb/>
            a force so resistless as to be able with their stroke to burst asunder <lb/>
            towers, throw down houses, wrench away beams and rafters, and <lb/>
            cast down and burn up the monuments of men, to strike men <lb/>
            dead, prostrate cattle far and near, by what force they can do all <lb/>
            this and the like, I will make clear and will not longer detain you <lb/>
            with mere professions.</p>
          <p>Thunderbolts we must suppose to be begotten out of dense <lb/>
            clouds piled up high ; for they are never sent forth at all when the <lb/>
            sky is clear or when the clouds are of a slight density. That this <lb/>
            is so beyond all question is proved by facts evident to sense: <lb/>
            clouds at such times form so dense a mass over the whole sky that <lb/>
            we might imagine all its darkness had abandoned Acheron through­ <lb/>
            out and filled up the great vaults of heaven: In such numbers, <lb/>
            gathering up out of the frightful night of storm-clouds, do faces of <lb/>
            black horror hang over us on high; what time the storm begins to <lb/>
            forge its thunderbolts. Very often again a black storm-cloud too <lb/>
            out at sea, like a stream of pitch sent down from heaven, falls in <lb/>
            such wise upon the waters heavily charged with darkness afar off <lb/>
            and draws down a black tempest big with lightnings and storms, <lb/>
            itself so fraught above all the rest with tires and winds, that even <lb/>
            on land men shudder and seek shelter. Thus then we must sup­ <lb/>
            pose that the storm above our head reaches high up; for the <lb/>
            clouds would never bury the earth in such thick darkness, unless <lb/>
            they were built up high heap upon heap, the sunlight totally dis­ <lb/>
            appearing ; nor could the clouds when they descend drown it with <lb/>
            so great a rain, as to make rivers overflow and put fields under <lb/>
            water, if they were not piled high up in the sky. In this case <lb/>
            then all things are filled with winds and fire; therefore thunder­ <pb n="159"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="270—311"/> <lb/>
            ings and lightnings go on all about. For I have shewn above that <lb/>
            hollow clouds have very many seeds of heat, and they must also <lb/>
            take many in from the sun's rays and their heat. On this account <lb/>
            when the same wind which happens to collect them into any one <lb/>
            place, has forced out many seeds of heat and has mixed itself up <lb/>
            with that fire, then the eddy of wind forces a way in and whirls <lb/>
            about in the straitened room and points the thunderbolt in the <lb/>
            fiery furnaces within; for it is kindled in two ways at once: it is <lb/>
            heated by its own velocity and from the contact of fire. After that <lb/>
            when the force of the wind has been thoroughly heated and the <lb/>
            impetuous power of the fire has entered in, then the thunderbolt <lb/>
            fully forged as it were suddenly rends the cloud, and the heat put <lb/>
            in motion is carried on traversing all places with flashing lights. <lb/>
            Close upon it falls so heavy a clap that it seems to crush down <lb/>
            from above the quarters of heaven which have all at once sprung <lb/>
            asunder. Then a trembling violently seizes the earth and rumb­ <lb/>
            lings run through high heaven; for the whole body of the storm <lb/>
            then without exception quakes with the shock and loud roarings <lb/>
            are aroused. After this shock follows so heavy and copious a rain <lb/>
            that the whole ether seems to be turning into rain and then to be <lb/>
            tumbling down and returning to a deluge: so great a flood of it is <lb/>
            discharged by the bursting of the cloud and the storm of wind, <lb/>
            when the sound flies forth from the burning stroke. At times too <lb/>
            the force of the wind set in motion from without falls on a cloud <lb/>
            hot with a fully forged thunderbolt; and when it has burst it, <lb/>
            forthwith there falls down yon fiery eddying whirl which in our <lb/>
            native speech we call a thunderbolt. The same takes place on <lb/>
            every other side towards which the force in question has borne <lb/>
            down. Sometimes too the power of the wind though discharged <lb/>
            without fire, yet catches fire in the course of its long travel, and <lb/>
            while it is passing on, it loses on the way some large bodies which <lb/>
            cannot like the rest get through the air; and gathers together out <lb/>
            of the air itself and carries along with it other bodies of very <lb/>
            small size which mix with it and produce fire by their flight; very <lb/>
            much in the same way as a leaden ball becomes hot during its <lb/>
            course, when it loses many bodies of cold and has taken up fire in <lb/>
            the air. Sometimes too the force of the blow itself strikes out fire, <lb/>
            when the force of wind discharged in a cold state without fire has <lb/>
            struck, because sure enough, when it has smitten with a powerful <pb n="160"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="311—349"/> <lb/>
            stroke, the elements of heat are able to stream together out of the <lb/>
            wind itself and at the same time out of the thing which then <lb/>
            encounters the stroke. Thus, when we strike a stone with iron, <lb/>
            fire flies out; and none the less, because the force of the iron <lb/>
            is cold, do its seeds of fiery brightness meet together upon the <lb/>
            stroke. Therefore in the same way too a thing ought to be set on <lb/>
            fire by the thunderbolt, if it has happened to be in a state suited <lb/>
            to receive and susceptible of the flames. At the same time the <lb/>
            might of the wind cannot lightly be thought to be absolutely and <lb/>
            decidedly cold, seeing that it is discharged with such force from <lb/>
            above; but if it is not already set on fire during its course, it yet <lb/>
            arrives in a warm state with heat mixed up in it.</p>
          <p>But the velocity of thunderbolts is great and their stroke <lb/>
            powerful, and they run through their course with a rapid descent, <lb/>
            because their force when set in motion first in all cases collects <lb/>
            itself in the clouds and gathers itself up for a great effort at start­ <lb/>
            ing ; then when the cloud is no longer able to hold the increased <lb/>
            moving power, their force is pressed out and therefore flies with a <lb/>
            marvellous moving power, like to that with which missiles are <lb/>
            carried when discharged from powerful engines. Then too the <lb/>
            thunderbolt consists of small and smooth elements, and such a <lb/>
            nature it is not easy for anything to withstand; for it flies between <lb/>
            and passes in through the porous passages; therefore it is not <lb/>
            checked and delayed by many collisions, and for this reason it <lb/>
            glides and flies on with a swift moving power. Next, all weights <lb/>
            without exception naturally pressing downward, when to this a <lb/>
            blow is added, the velocity is doubled and yon moving power <lb/>
            becomes so intense that the thunderbolt dashes aside more impe­ <lb/>
            tuously and swiftly whatever gets in its way and tries to hinder it, <lb/>
            and pursues its journey. Then too as it advances with a long­ <lb/>
            continued moving power, it must again and again receive new <lb/>
            velocity which ever increases as it goes on and augments its <lb/>
            powerful might and gives vigour to its stroke ; for it forces all the <lb/>
            seeds of the thunder to be borne right onward to one spot so to <lb/>
            speak, throwing them all together, as on they roll, into that single <lb/>
            line. Perhaps too as it goes on it attracts certain bodies out of <lb/>
            the air itself, and these by their blows kindle apace its velocity. <lb/>
            It passes too through things without injuring them, and leaves <lb/>
            many things quite whole after it has gone through, because the <pb n="161"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="349—390"/> <lb/>
            clear bright fire flies through by the pores. And it breaks to <lb/>
            pieces many things, when the first bodies of the thunderbolt have <lb/>
            fallen exactly on the first bodies of these things, at the points <lb/>
            where they are intertwined and held together. Again it easily <lb/>
            melts brass and fuses gold in an instant, because its force is formed <lb/>
            of bodies minutely small and of smooth elements, which easily <lb/>
            make their way in and when they are in, in a moment break up <lb/>
            all the knots and untie the bonds of union. And more especially <lb/>
            in autumn the mansion of heaven studded with glittering stars and <lb/>
            the whole earth are shaken on all sides, and also when the flowery <lb/>
            season of spring discloses itself. For during the cold fires are <lb/>
            wanting and winds fail during the heat, and the clouds then are <lb/>
            not of so dense a body. When therefore the seasons of heaven are <lb/>
            between the two extremes, the different causes of thunder and <lb/>
            lightning all combine; for the very cross-current of the year mixes <lb/>
            up cold and heat, both of which a cloud needs for forging thunder­ <lb/>
            bolts; so that there is great discord in things and the air raving <lb/>
            with fires and winds heaves in mighty disorder. The first part of <lb/>
            heat and the last of cold is the spring-time; therefore unlike things <lb/>
            must battle with one another and be turbulent when mixed toge­ <lb/>
            ther. And when the last heat mixed with the first cold rolls on its <lb/>
            course, a time which goes by the name of autumn, then too fierce <lb/>
            winters are in conflict with summers. Therefore these seasons are <lb/>
            to be called the cross-seas of the year; and it is not wonderful that <lb/>
            in that season thunderbolts are most frequent and troublous storms <lb/>
            are stirred up in heaven; since both sides then engage in the <lb/>
            troublous medley of dubious war, the one armed with flames, the <lb/>
            other with winds and water commingled.</p>
          <p>This is the way to see into the true nature of the thunderbolt <lb/>
            and to understand by what force it produces each effect, and not <lb/>
            the turning over the scrolls of Tyrrhene charms and vainly search­ <lb/>
            ing for tokens of the hidden will of the gods, in order to know <lb/>
            from what quarter the volant fire has come or to which of the two <lb/>
            halves it has betaken itself, in what way it has gained an entrance <lb/>
            within walled places, and how after lording it with tyrant sway it <lb/>
            has gotten itself out from these; also what harm the thunderstroke <lb/>
            from heaven can do. But if Jupiter and other gods shake with <lb/>
            an appalling crash the glittering quarters of heaven, and hurl <lb/>
            their fire whither each is so minded, why strike they not those <note type="footnote"> M. III. </note> <note type="footnote"> L </note> <lb/>

            whoever they be who have reeked not of committing some abomin­ <lb/>
            able sin and make them give forth the flames of lightning from <lb/>
            breast pierced through and through, a sharp lesson to men ? and <lb/>
            why rather is he whose conscience is burdened with no foul offence, <lb/>
            innocent though he be, wrapped and enveloped in the flames, in a <lb/>
            moment caught up by the whirlwind and fire of heaven ? Why <lb/>
            too aim they at solitary spots and spend their labour in vain ? or <lb/>
            are they then practising their arms and strengthening their <lb/>
            sinews ? and why do they suffer the father's bolt to be blunted on <lb/>
            the earth ? why does he allow it himself, and not spare it for his <lb/>
            enemies ? Why again, when heaven is unclouded on all sides, <lb/>
            does Jupiter never hurl a bolt on the earth or send abroad his <lb/>
            claps ? or does he, so soon as clouds have spread under, then go <lb/>
            down in person into them, that from them he may aim the strokes <lb/>
            of his bolt near at hand ? Ay and for what reason does he hurl <lb/>
            into the sea ? of what has he to impeach its waters and liquid <lb/>
            mass and floating fields ? Again if he wills us to avoid the thun­ <lb/>
            derstroke, why fears he to let us see it discharged ? or if he wills <lb/>
            to crush us off our guard with his fire, why thunders he from that <lb/>
            side, to enable us to shun it ? why stirs he up beforehand dark­ <lb/>
            ness and roarings and rumblings ? And how can you believe that <lb/>
            he hurls at many points at the same time ? or would you venture <lb/>
            to maintain that it never has happened that more than one stroke <lb/>
            was made at one time ? Nay often and often it has happened and <lb/>
            must happen that, even as it rains and showers fall in many differ­ <lb/>
            ent quarters, so many thunderings go on at one time. Once more <lb/>
            why does he dash down the holy sanctuaries of the gods and his <lb/>
            own gorgeous seats with the destroying thunderbolt, and break the <lb/>
            finewrought idols of the gods, and spoil his own images of their <lb/>
            glory by an overbearing wound ? and why does he mostly aim at <lb/>
            lofty spots, and why do we see most traces of his fire on the moun­ <lb/>
            tain tops ?</p>
          <p>To proceed, it is easy from these facts to understand in what <lb/>
            way those things, which the Greeks from their nature have named <lb/>
            presteres, come down from above into the sea. For sometimes a <lb/>
            pillar so to speak is let down from heaven and descends into the <lb/>
            sea, and round about it the surges boil, stirred up by heavy blasts <lb/>
            of winds; and all ships caught in that turmoil are dashed about <lb/>
            and brought into extreme danger. This takes place when at times <pb n="163"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="431—472"/> <lb/>
            the force of the wind put in motion cannot burst the cloud which <lb/>
            it essays to burst, but weighs it down, so that it is like a pillar let <lb/>
            down from heaven into the sea, yet gradually, just as if a thing <lb/>
            were thrust down from above and stretched out to the level of the <lb/>
            waters by the fist and push of the arm; and when the force of the <lb/>
            wind has rent this cloud, it bursts out from it into the sea and <lb/>
            occasions a marvellous boiling in the waters ; for the whirling eddy <lb/>
            descends and brings down together with it yon cloud of limber <lb/>
            body; and as soon as it has forced it down full-charged as it is to <lb/>
            the levels of the sea, the eddy in a moment plunges itself entire <lb/>
            into the water, and stirs up the whole sea with a prodigious noise <lb/>
            and forces it to boil. Sometimes too the eddy of wind wraps itself <lb/>
            up in clouds and gathers out of the air seeds of cloud and imitates <lb/>
            in a sort the prester let down from heaven. When this prester <lb/>
            has let itself down to the land and has burst, it belches forth a <lb/>
            whirlwind and storm of enormous violence; but as it seldom takes <lb/>
            place at all and as mountains cannot but obstruct it on land, it is <lb/>
            seen more frequently on the sea with its wide prospect and unob­ <lb/>
            structed horizon.</p>
          <p>Clouds are formed, when in this upper space of heaven many <lb/>
            bodies flying about have in some one instant met together, of a <lb/>
            rougher sort, such as are able, though they have got the very <lb/>
            slightest holds of each other, to catch together and be held in <lb/>
            union. These bodies first cause small clouds to form; and these <lb/>
            next catch together and collect into masses and increase by join­ <lb/>
            ing with each other and are carried on by the winds continually <lb/>
            until a fierce storm has gathered. The nearer too the tops of a <lb/>
            mountain in each case are to heaven, the more constantly at this <lb/>
            elevation they smoke with the thick darkness of a swarthy cloud, <lb/>
            because, as soon as clouds form, before the eyes can see them, thin <lb/>
            as they are, the winds carry and bring them together to the <lb/>
            highest summits of a mountain; and then at last when they have <lb/>
            gathered in a greater mass, being now dense they are able to <lb/>
            make themselves visible and at the same time they are seen to <lb/>
            rise up from the very top of the mountain into the ether: the very <lb/>
            fact of the case and our sensations, when we climb high moun­ <lb/>
            tains, prove that the regions which stretch up on high are windy. <lb/>
            Again clothes hung up on the shore, when they drink in the <lb/>
            clinging moisture, prove that nature takes up many bodies over <note type="footnote"> L 2 </note> <lb/>
            <pb n="164"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="470—514"/><lb/>
            the whole sea as well. This makes it still more plain that many <lb/>
            bodies may likewise rise up out of the salt heaving sea to add <lb/>
            to the bulk of clouds; for the two liquids are near akin in their <lb/>
            nature. Again we see mists and steam rise out of all rivers and <lb/>
            at the same time from the earth as well; and they forced out like <lb/>
            a breath from these parts are then carried upwards and overcast <lb/>
            heaven with their darkness and make up clouds on high' as they <lb/>
            gradually come together; for the heat of starry ether at the same <lb/>
            time presses down too on them and by condensing as it were <lb/>
            weaves a web of clouds below the blue. Sometimes there come <lb/>
            here into heaven from without those bodies which form clouds <lb/>
            and the flying storm-rack; for I have shewn that their number <lb/>
            passes numbering and that the sum of the deep is infinite; and I <lb/>
            have proved with what velocity bodies fly and how in a moment <lb/>
            of time they are wont to pass through space unspeakable. It is <lb/>
            not therefore strange that a tempest and darkness often in a short <lb/>
            time cover over with such great mountains of clouds seas and <lb/>
            lands, as they hang down upon them overhead, since on all sides <lb/>
            through all the cavities of ether and as it were through the vents <lb/>
            of the great world around the power of going out and coming in is <lb/>
            accorded to the elements.</p>
          <p>Now mark and I will explain in what way the rainy moisture <lb/>
            is formed in the clouds above and then is sent down and falls to <lb/>
            the earth in the shape of rain. And first I will prove that many <lb/>
            seeds of water rise up together with the clouds themselves out of <lb/>
            all things and that both the clouds and the water which is in the <lb/>
            clouds thus increase together; just as our body increases together <lb/>
            with the blood, as well as the sweat and all the moisture which is <lb/>
            in the frame. The clouds likewise imbibe much sea-water as well, <lb/>
            like hanging fleeces of wool, when the winds carry them over the <lb/>
            great sea. In like manner moisture is taken up out of all rivers <lb/>
            into the clouds; and when the seeds of waters full many in num­ <lb/>
            ber in many ways have met in them, augmented from all sides, <lb/>
            then the close-packed clouds endeavour to discharge their moisture <lb/>
            from two causes: the force of the wind drives them together, and <lb/>
            likewise the very abundance of the rain-clouds, when a greater <lb/>
            mass than usual has been brought together, pushes down, presses <lb/>
            from above and forces the rain to stream out. Again when the <lb/>
            clouds are also rarefied by the winds, or are dispersed, being smit­ <pb n="165"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="514—554"/> <lb/>
            ten at the same time by the heat of the sun, they discharge a <lb/>
            rainy moisture and trickle down, just as wax over a hot fire melts <lb/>
            away and turns fast into liquid. But a violent rain follows, when <lb/>
            the clouds are violently pressed upon by both causes, by their <lb/>
            own accumulated weight and by the impetuous assault of the <lb/>
            wind. And rains are wont to hold out and to last long, when <lb/>
            many seeds of waters are stirred to action, and clouds upon clouds <lb/>
            and rack upon rack welling forth from all quarters round about <lb/>
            are borne along, and when the reeking earth steams moisture <lb/>
            back again from its whole surface. When in such a case the sun <lb/>
            has shone with his rays amid the murky tempest right opposite <lb/>
            the dripping rain-clouds, then the colour of the rainbow shews <lb/>
            itself among the black clouds.</p>
          <p>As to the other things which grow by themselves and are <lb/>
            formed by themselves, as well as the things which are formed <lb/>
            within the clouds, all, without exception all, snow winds hail and <lb/>
            cold hoarfrosts and the great force of ice, the great congealing <lb/>
            power of waters, and the stop which everywhere curbs running <lb/>
            rivers, it is yet most easy to find out and apprehend in mind how <lb/>
            all these things take place and in what way they are formed, when <lb/>
            you have fully understood the properties assigned to elements.</p>
          <p>Now mark and learn what the law of earthquakes is. And <lb/>
            first of all take for granted that the earth below us as well as <lb/>
            above is filled in all parts with windy caverns and bears within <lb/>
            its bosom many lakes and many chasms, cliffs and craggy rocks; <lb/>
            and you must suppose that many rivers hidden beneath the crust <lb/>
            of the earth roll on with violence waves and submerged stones; <lb/>
            for the very nature of the case requires it to be throughout like <lb/>
            to itself. With such things then attached and placed below, the <lb/>
            earth quakes above from the shock of great falling masses, when <lb/>
            underneath time has undermined vast caverns; whole mountains <lb/>
            indeed fall in, and in an instant from the mighty shock trem­ <lb/>
            blings spread themselves far and wide from that centre. And <lb/>
            with good cause, since buildings beside a road tremble throughout <lb/>
            when shaken by a waggon of not such very great weight; and <lb/>
            they rock no less, where any sharp pebble on the road jolts up <lb/>
            the iron tires of the wheels on both sides. Sometimes too, when <lb/>
            an enormous mass of soil through age rolls down from the land <lb/>
            into great and extensive pools of water, the earth rocks and sways <lb/>
            <pb n="166"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="554—594"/><lb/>
            with the undulation of the water; just as a vessel at times cannot <lb/>
            rest, until the liquid within has ceased to sway about in unsteady <lb/>
            undulations.</p>
          <p>Again when the wind gathering itself together in the hollow <lb/>
            places underground bears down on one point and pushing on <lb/>
            presses with great violence the deep caverns, the earth leans over <lb/>
            on the side to which the headlong violence of the wind presses. <lb/>
            Then all buildings which arc above ground, and ever the more, <lb/>
            the more they tower up towards heaven, lean over and bulge out <lb/>
            yielding in the same direction, and the timbers wrenched from <lb/>
            their supports hang over ready to give way. And yet men shrink <lb/>
            from believing that a time of destruction and ruin awaits the <lb/>
            nature of the great world, though they see so great a mass of earth <lb/>
            hang ready to fall! And if the winds did not abate their blowing, <lb/>
            no force could rein things in or hold them up on their road to <lb/>
            destruction. As it is, because by turns they do abate and then <lb/>
            increase in violence, and so to speak rally and return to the charge, <lb/>
            and then are defeated and retire, for this reason the earth oftener <lb/>
            threatens to fall than really falls : it leans over and then sways <lb/>
            back again, and after tumbling forward recovers in equal poise its <lb/>
            fixed position. For this reason the whole house rocks, the top <lb/>
            more than the middle, the middle than the bottom, the bottom in <lb/>
            a very very slight degree.</p>
          <p>The same great quaking likewise arises from this cause, when <lb/>
            on a sudden the wind and some enormous force of air gathering <lb/>
            either from without or within the earth have flung themselves <lb/>
            into the hollows of the earth, and there chafe at first with much <lb/>
            uproar among the great caverns and are carried on with a whirling <lb/>
            motion, and when their force afterwards stirred and lashed into <lb/>
            fury bursts abroad and at the same moment cleaves the deep <lb/>
            earth and opens up a great yawning chasm. This fell out in <lb/>
            Syrian Sidon and took place at Aegium in the Peloponnese, two <lb/>
            towns which an outbreak of wind of this sort and the ensuing <lb/>
            earthquake threw down. And many walled places besides fell <lb/>
            down by great commotions on land and many towns sank down <lb/>
            engulphed in the sea together with their burghers. And if they <lb/>
            do not break out, still the impetuous fury of the air and the fierce <lb/>
            violence of the wind spread over the numerous passages of the <lb/>
            earth like a shivering-fit and-thereby cause a trembling; just as <lb/>
            <pb n="167"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="594—636"/><lb/>
            cold when it has pierced into our frames to the very marrow, sets <lb/>
            them a-shivering in spite of themselves, forcing them to shake <lb/>
            and move. Men are therefore disturbed by a twofold terror <lb/>
            throughout their cities: they fear the roofs above their heads, they <lb/>
            dread lest the nature of the earth in a moment break up her <lb/>
            caverns underneath, and rent asunder display her own wide-gaping <lb/>
            maw and wildly tumbled together seek to fill it up with her own <lb/>
            ruins. Let them then fancy as much as they please that heaven <lb/>
            and earth shall be incorruptible and consigned to an everlasting <lb/>
            exemption from decay; and yet sometimes the very present force <lb/>
            of danger applies on some side or other this goad of fear among <lb/>
            others, that the earth shall in an instant be withdrawn from <lb/>
            under their feet and carried down into the pit, and that the sum <lb/>
            of things shall utterly give way and follow after and a jumbled <lb/>
            wreck of world ensue.</p>
          <p>First of all they wonder that nature does not increase the <lb/>
            bulk of the sea, when there is so great a flow of water into it, <lb/>
            when all rivers from all quarters fall into it. Add to these <lb/>
            passing rains and flying storms, which bespatter every sea and <lb/>
            moisten every land ; add its own springs; yet all these compared <lb/>
            with the sum of the sea will be like an addition of bulk hardly <lb/>
            amounting to a single drop; it is therefore the less wonderful <lb/>
            that the great sea does not increase. Again the sun absorbs a <lb/>
            great deal with his heat: we see him with his burning rays <lb/>
            thoroughly dry clothes dripping with wet: but we know seas to <lb/>
            be many in number and to stretch over a wide surface. Therefore <lb/>
            however small the portion of moisture which the sun draws off the <lb/>
            surface from any one spot, it will yet in so vast an expanse take <lb/>
            largely from its waters. Then again the winds too may withdraw <lb/>
            a great deal of moisture as they sweep over the surface, since we <lb/>
            very often see the roads dried by the winds in a single night and <lb/>
            the soft mud form into hard crusts. Again I have shewn that the <lb/>
            clouds take off much moisture too imbibed from the great surface <lb/>
            of the sea and scatter it about over the whole earth, when it rains <lb/>
            on land and the winds carry on the clouds. Lastly since the earth <lb/>
            is of a porous body and is in contact with the sea, girding its <lb/>
            shores all round, just as water comes from the earth into the sea, <lb/>
            in the same way it must ooze into the land out of the salt sea; <lb/>
            for the salt is strained off and the matter of liquid streams back <lb/>
            <pb n="168"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="636—678"/><lb/>
            again to the source and all flows together to the river-heads, and <lb/>
            then passes anew over the lands in a fresh current, where a <lb/>
            channel once scooped out has carried down the waters with <lb/>
            liquid foot.</p>
          <p>And now I will explain why it is that fires breathe forth at <lb/>
            times through the gorges of mount Aetna with such hurricane­ <lb/>
            like fury; for with a destroying force of no ordinary kind the <lb/>
            flame-storm gathered itself up and lording it over the lands of <lb/>
            the Sicilians drew on itself the gaze of neighbouring nations, when <lb/>
            seeing all the quarters of heaven smoke and sparkle men were <lb/>
            filled in heart with awe-struck apprehension, not knowing what <lb/>
            strange change nature was travailing to work.</p>
          <p>In these matters you must look far and deep and make a <lb/>
            wide survey in all directions, In order to bear in mind that the <lb/>
            sum of things is unfathomable and to perceive how very small, <lb/>
            how inconceivably minute a fraction of the whole sum one hea­ <lb/>
            ven is, not so large a fraction of it as one man is of the whole <lb/>
            earth. If you should clearly comprehend, clearly see this point <lb/>
            well put, you would cease to wonder at many things. Does any <lb/>
            one among us wonder if he has gotten into his frame a fever <lb/>
            that has broken out with burning heat, or into his body the <lb/>
            pains of any other disease ? the foot suddenly swells, sharp pain <lb/>
            often seizes the teeth, or else attacks the eyes; the holy fire <lb/>
            breaks out and creeping over the body burns whatever part it <lb/>
            has seized upon, and spreads over the frame, because sure enough <lb/>
            there are seeds of many things, and this earth and heaven bring <lb/>
            to us evil enough to allow of a measureless amount of disease <lb/>
            springing up. In this way then we must suppose that all things <lb/>
            are supplied out of the infinite to the whole heaven and earth in <lb/>
            quantity sufficient to allow the earth in a moment to be shaken <lb/>
            and stirred, and a rapid hurricane to scour over sea and land, the <lb/>
            fire of Aetna to overflow, the heaven to be in flames; for that too <lb/>
            is seen and the heavenly quarters are on fire; and rain-storms <lb/>
            gather in a heavier mass, when the seeds of water have haply <lb/>
            come together for such an end. 'Ay but the stormy rage of the <lb/>
            conflagration is too too gigantic.' Yes and so any river you like <lb/>
            is greatest to him who has never before seen any greater, and thus <lb/>
            a tree and a man seem gigantic, and in the case of all things of all <lb/>
            kinds the greatest a man has seen he fancies to be gigantic, though <lb/>
            <pb n="169"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="678—716"/><lb/>
            yet all things with heaven and earth and sea included are nothing <lb/>
            to the whole sum of the universal sum.</p>
          <p>And now at last I will explain in what ways yon flame roused <lb/>
            to fury in a moment blazes forth from the huge furnaces of Aetna. <lb/>
            And first the nature of the whole mountain is hollow underneath, <lb/>
            underpropped throughout with caverns of basalt rocks. Further­ <lb/>
            more in all caves are wind and air; for wind is produced, when <lb/>
            the air has been stirred and put in motion. When this air has <lb/>
            been thoroughly heated and raging about has imparted its heat <lb/>
            to all the rocks round, wherever it comes in contact with them, <lb/>
            and to the earth, and has struck out from them fire burning with <lb/>
            swift flames, it rises up and then forces itself out on high straight <lb/>
            through the gorges; and so carries its heat far and scatters far its <lb/>
            ashes and rolls on smoke of a thick pitchy blackness and flings <lb/>
            out at the same time stones of prodigious weight; leaving no <lb/>
            doubt that this is the stormy force of air. Again the sea to a <lb/>
            great extent breaks its waves and sucks back its surf at the roots <lb/>
            of that mountain. Caverns reach from this sea as far as the deep <lb/>
            gorges of the mountain below. Through these you must admit <lb/>
            [that air mixed up with water passes ; and] the nature of the case <lb/>
            compels [this air to enter in from that] open sea and pass right <lb/>
            within and then go out in blasts and so lift up flame and throw <lb/>
            out stones and raise clouds of sand; for on the summit are craters, <lb/>
            as they name them in their own language; what we call gorges <lb/>
            and mouths.</p>
          <p>There are things too not a few for which it is not sufficient to <lb/>
            assign one cause; you must give several, one of which at the same <lb/>
            time is the real cause. For instance should you see the lifeless <lb/>
            body of a man lying at some distance, it would be natural to men­ <lb/>
            tion all the different causes of death, in order that the one real <lb/>
            cause of that man's death be mentioned among them. Thus you <lb/>
            may be able to prove that he has not died by steel or cold or from <lb/>
            disease or haply from poison; yet we know that it is something <lb/>
            of this kind which has befallen him; and so in many other cases <lb/>
            . we may make the same remark.</p>
          <p>The Nile rises every summer and overflows the plains, that <lb/>
            one sole river throughout the whole land of Egypt. It waters <lb/>
            Egypt often in the middle of the hot season, either because in <lb/>
            summer there are north winds opposite its mouths, which at that <pb n="170"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="716—755"/> <lb/>
            time of year go by the name of etesian winds. Blowing up the <lb/>
            river they retard it and driving the waters backwards fill its <lb/>
            channel full and force the river to stand still; for beyond a doubt <lb/>
            these blasts which start from the icy constellations of the pole are <lb/>
            carried right up the stream. That river comes from the south <lb/>
            out of the heat-fraught country, rising far up from the central <lb/>
            region of day among races of men black in their sun-baked com­ <lb/>
            plexion. It is quite possible too that the great accumulation of <lb/>
            sand may bar up the mouths against the opposing waves, when <lb/>
            the sea stirred up by the winds throws up the sand within the <lb/>
            channel; whereby the outlet of the river is rendered less free and <lb/>
            the current of the waters at the same time less rapid in its down­ <lb/>
            ward flow. It may be also that the rains are more frequent at <lb/>
            its source in that season, because the etesian blasts of the north <lb/>
            winds drive all the clouds together into those parts at that time. <lb/>
            And, you are to know, when they have been driven on to the <lb/>
            central region of day and have gathered together, then the clouds <lb/>
            jammed close against the high mountains are massed together and <lb/>
            violently compressed. Perhaps too it gets its increase high up <lb/>
            from the lofty mountains of the Ethiopians, when the all-surveying <lb/>
            sun with his thawing rays constrains the white snows to descend <lb/>
            into the plains.</p>
          <p>Now mark, and I will make clear to you what kind of nature <lb/>
            the several Avernian places and lakes possess. First of all, as to <lb/>
            the name Avernian by which they are called, it has been given to <lb/>
            them from their real nature, because they are noxious to all birds; <lb/>
            for when they have arrived in flight just opposite those spots, they <lb/>
            forget to row with their wings, they drop their sails and fall with <lb/>
            soft neck outstretched headlong to the earth, if so be that the na­ <lb/>
            ture of the ground admit of that, or into the water, if so be that a <lb/>
            lake of Avernus spreads below. There is such a spot at Cumae, <lb/>
            where the mountains are charged with acrid sulphur, and smoke <lb/>
            enriched with hot springs. Such a spot there also is within the <lb/>
            Athenian walls, on the very summit ‘of the citadel, beside the <lb/>
            temple of bountiful Tritonian Pallas; which croaking crows never . <lb/>
            come near on the wing; no not when the high altars smoke with <lb/>
            offerings: so constantly they fly, not before the sharp wrath of <lb/>
            Pallas for the sake of yon vigil kept, as the poets of the Greeks <lb/>
            have sung, but the nature of the place suffices by its own proper <pb n="171"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="755—795"/> <lb/>
            power. In Syria too as well a spot, we are told, is found to exist <lb/>
            of such a sort that as soon as ever even fourfooted beasts have <lb/>
            entered in, its mere natural power forces them to fall down heavily, <lb/>
            just as if they were felled in a moment as sacrifices to the manes <lb/>
            gods. Now all these things go on by a natural law, and it is <lb/>
            quite plain whence spring the causes from which they are pro­ <lb/>
            duced ; that the gate of Orcus be not haply believed to exist in <lb/>
            such spots; and next we imagine that the manes gods from be­ <lb/>
            neath do haply draw souls down from them to the borders of <lb/>
            Acheron; as wing-footed stags are supposed often by their scent <lb/>
            to draw out from their holes the savage serpent-tribes. How <lb/>
            widely opposed to true reason this is, now learn; for now I essay <lb/>
            to tell of the real fact.</p>
          <p>First of all I say, as I have often said before, that in the earth <lb/>
            are elements of things of every kind: many, which serve for food, <lb/>
            helpful to life; and many whose property it is to cause diseases <lb/>
            and hasten death. And we have shewn before that one thing is <lb/>
            more adapted to one, another thing to another living creature for <lb/>
            the purposes of life, because of their natures and their textures <lb/>
            and their primary elements being all unlike the one to the other. <lb/>
            Many which are noxious pass through the ears, many make their <lb/>
            way too through the nostrils, dangerous and harsh when they <lb/>
            come in contact; and not a few are to be shunned by the touch, <lb/>
            and not a few to be avoided by the sight, and others are nauseous <lb/>
            in taste.</p>
          <p>Again you may see how many things are for man of a viru­ <lb/>
            lently noxious sensation and are nauseous and oppressive; to cer­ <lb/>
            tain trees for instance has been given so very oppressive a shade <lb/>
            that they often cause headaches when a man has lain down under <lb/>
            them extended on the grass. There is a tree too on the great <lb/>
            hills of Helicon which has the property of killing a man by the <lb/>
            noisome scent of its flower. All these things you are to know <lb/>
            rise up out of the earth, because it contains many seeds of many <lb/>
            things in many ways mixed up together and gives them out in a <lb/>
            state of separation. Again when a newly extinguished night-light <lb/>
            encounters the nostrils with its acrid stench, it sends to sleep then <lb/>
            and there a man who from disease is subject to falling down and <lb/>
            foaming at the mouth. A woman is put to sleep by oppressive <lb/>
            castor and falls back in her seat, and her gay work drops out of <pb n="172"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="795—836"/> <lb/>
            her soft hands, if she has smelt it at the time when she has her <lb/>
            monthly discharges. And many things besides relax through all <lb/>
            the frame the fainting limbs and shake the soul in its seats within. <lb/>
            Then too if you linger long in the hot baths when yon arc some­ <lb/>
            what full and do bathe, how liable you are to tumble down in a fit <lb/>
            while seated in the midst of the hot water! Again how readily <lb/>
            do the oppressive power and fumes of charcoal make their way <lb/>
            into the brain, if we have not first taken water! But when burn­ <lb/>
            ing violently it has filled the chambers of a house, the fumes of <lb/>
            the virulent substance act on the nerves like a murderous blow. <lb/>
            See yon not too that even within the earth sulphur is generated <lb/>
            and asphalt forms incrustations of a noisome stench ? see you not, <lb/>
            when they are following up the veins of silver and gold and <lb/>
            searching with the pick quite into the bowels of the earth, what <lb/>
            stenches Scaptensula exhales from below ? Then what mischief <lb/>
            do gold mines exhale! to what state do they reduce men's faces <lb/>
            and what a complexion they produce! Know von nut by sight or <lb/>
            hearsay how they commonly perish in a short time and how all <lb/>
            vital power fails those whom the hard compulsion of necessity con­ <lb/>
            fines in such an employment? All such exhalations then the <lb/>
            earth steams forth and breathes out into the open air and light of <lb/>
            heaven.</p>
          <p>Thus too the Avernian spots must send up some power deadly <lb/>
            to birds, which rises up from the earth into the air so as to poison <lb/>
            a certain portion of the atmosphere; in such a way that a bird as <lb/>
            soon as ever it is borne on its wings into it, is then attacked by <lb/>
            the unseen poison and so palsied that it tumbles plump down on <lb/>
            the spot where this exhalation has its course. And when it falls <lb/>
            into it, then the same power of that exhalation robs all its limbs <lb/>
            of the remnants of life : first of all it causes a sort of dizziness; but <lb/>
            afterwards, when the birds have tumbled into the very springs of <lb/>
            the poison, then life too has to be vomited forth, because all round <lb/>
            rises up large store of mischievous matter.</p>
          <p>Sometimes too this power and exhalation of Avernus dispels <lb/>
            whatever air lies between the birds and earth, so that almost a <lb/>
            void is left there. And when the birds have arrived in their <lb/>
            flight just opposite this spot, at once the buoyant force of their <lb/>
            pinions is crippled and rendered vain and all the sustaining efforts <lb/>
            of their wings are lost on both sides. So when they are unable to <pb n="173"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="836—878"/> <lb/>
            buoy themselves up and lean upon their wings, nature, you know, <lb/>
            compels them by their weight to tumble down to earth, and lying <lb/>
            stark through what is now almost a void they disperse their soul <lb/>
            through all the openings of their body. * * Again during summer the <lb/>
            water in wells becomes colder, because the earth is rarefied by heat <lb/>
            and rapidly sends out into the air whatever seeds of heat it hap­ <lb/>
            pens to have. The more then the earth is drained of heat, the <lb/>
            colder becomes the water which is hidden in the earth. Again <lb/>
            when all the earth is compressed by cold and contracts and so to <lb/>
            say congeals, then, you are to know, while it contracts, it presses <lb/>
            out into the wells whatever heat it contains itself.</p>
          <p>At the fane of Hammon there is said to be a fountain which <lb/>
            is cold in the daylight and hot in the night-time. This fountain <lb/>
            men marvel at exceedingly and suppose that it suddenly becomes <lb/>
            hot by the influence of the fierce sun below the earth, when night <lb/>
            has covered the earth with awful darkness. But this is far far <lb/>
            removed from true reason. Why when the sun though in contact <lb/>
            with the uncovered body of the water has not been able to make it <lb/>
            hot on its upper side, though his light above possesses such great <lb/>
            heat, how can he below the earth which is of so dense a body boil <lb/>
            the water and glut it with heat? above all when he can scarcely <lb/>
            with his burning rays force his heat through the walls of houses. <lb/>
            What then is the cause ? this sure enough : the earth is more <lb/>
            porous and wanner round the fountain than the rest of the earth, <lb/>
            and there are many seeds of fire near the body of water. For this <lb/>
            reason when night has buried the earth in its dewy shadows, the <lb/>
            earth at once becomes quite cold and contracts: in this way just as <lb/>
            if it were squeezed by the hand it forces out into the fountain <lb/>
            whatever seeds of fire it has; and these make the water hot to the <lb/>
            touch and taste. Next when the sun has risen and with his rays <lb/>
            has loosened the earth and has rarefied it as his heat waxes <lb/>
            stronger, the first-beginnings of fire return back to their ancient <lb/>
            seats and all the heat of the water withdraws into the earth : for <lb/>
            this reason the fountain becomes cold in the daylight. Again the <lb/>
            liquid of water is played upon by the sun's rays and in the day­ <lb/>
            time is rarefied by his throbbing heat; and therefore it gives up <lb/>
            whatever seeds of fire it has; just as it often parts with the <lb/>
            frost which it holds in itself, and thaws the ice and loosens its <lb/>
            bonds.</p><pb n="174"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="879—919"/> There is also a cold fountain of such a nature that tow often <lb/>
            when held over it imbibes fire forthwith and emits flame; a pine <lb/>
            torch in like manner is lighted and shines among the waters, in <lb/>
            whatever direction it swims under the impulse of the winds. <lb/>
            Because sure enough there arc in the water very many seeds of <lb/>
            heat, and from the earth itself at the bottom must rise up bodies <lb/>
            of fire throughout- the whole fountain and at the same time pass <lb/>
            abroad in exhalations and go forth into the air, not in such numbers <lb/>
            however that the fountain can become hot, for these reasons a <lb/>
            force compels those seeds to burst out through the water and dis­ <lb/>
            perse abroad and to unite when they have mounted up. In <lb/>
            the sea at Aradus is a fountain of this kind, which wells up with <lb/>
            fresh water and keeps off the salt waters all round it; and in <lb/>
            many otlfer quarters the sea affords a seasonable help in need to <lb/>
            thirsting sailors, vomiting forth fresh waters amid the salt. In <lb/>
            this way then those seeds may burst forth through that fountain <lb/>
            and well out; and when they are met together in the tow or <lb/>
            cohere in the body of the pine-torch, they at once readily take <lb/>
            fire, because the tow and pinewood contain in them likewise <lb/>
            many seeds of latent fire. See you not too that, when you bring a <lb/>
            newly extinguished wick near night-lamps it catches light before <lb/>
            it has touched the flame; and the same with the pinewood ? And <lb/>
            many things beside catch fire at some distance touched merely by <lb/>
            the heat, before the fire in actual contact infects them. This <lb/>
            therefore you must suppose to take place in that fountain as <lb/>
            well.</p>
          <p>Next in order I will proceed to discuss by what law of nature <lb/>
            it comes to pass that iron can be attracted by that stone which <lb/>
            the Greeks call the Magnet from the name of its native place, <lb/>
            because it has its origin within the bounds of the country of the <lb/>
            Magnesians. This stone men wonder at; as it often produces a <lb/>
            chain of rings hanging down from it. Thus you may see some­ <lb/>
            times five and more suspended in succession and tossing about in <lb/>
            the light airs, one always hanging down from one and attached to <lb/>
            its lower side, and each in turn one from the other experiencing <lb/>
            the binding power of the stone: with such a continued current its <lb/>
            force flies through all.</p>
          <p>In things of this kind many points must be established before <lb/>
            you can assign the true law of the thing In question, and it must <pb n="175"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="919—962"/> <lb/>
            be approached by a very circuitous road ; wherefore all the more I <lb/>
            call for an attentive ear and mind.</p>
          <p>In the first place from all things whatsoever which we see <lb/>
            there must incessantly stream and be discharged and scattered <lb/>
            abroad such bodies as strike the eyes and provoke vision. Smells <lb/>
            too incessantly stream from certain things; as does cold from <lb/>
            rivers, heat from the sun, spray from the waves of the sea, that <lb/>
            eater into walls near the shore. Various sounds too cease not to <lb/>
            stream through the air. Then a moist salt flavour often comes <lb/>
            into the mouth, when we are moving about beside the sea; and <lb/>
            when we look on at the mixing of a decoction of wormwood, <lb/>
            its bitterness affects us. In such a constant stream from all things <lb/>
            the several qualities of things are carried and are transmitted in <lb/>
            all directions round, and no delay, no respite in the flow is ever <lb/>
            granted, since we constantly have feeling, and may at any time <lb/>
            see, smell and hear the sound of anything.</p>
          <p>And now I will state once again how rare a body all things <lb/>
            have: a question made clear in the first part of my poem also: <lb/>
            although the knowledge of this is of importance in regard to many <lb/>
            things, above all in regard to this very question which I am <lb/>
            coming to discuss, at the very outset it is necessary to establish <lb/>
            that nothing comes under sense save body mixed with void. For <lb/>
            instance in caves rocks overhead sweat with moisture and trickle <lb/>
            down in oozing drops. Sweat too oozes out from our whole <lb/>
            body; the beard grows, and hairs over all our limbs and frame. <lb/>
            Food is distributed through all the veins, gives increase and <lb/>
            nourishment to the very extremities and nails. We feel too cold <lb/>
            and heat pass through brass, we feel them pass through gold and <lb/>
            silver, when we hold full cups. Again voices fly through the stone <lb/>
            partitions of houses; smell passes through and cold, and the heat <lb/>
            of fire which is wont ay to pierce even the strength of iron, where <lb/>
            the Gaulish cuirass girds the body round. And when a storm has <lb/>
            gathered in earth and heaven, and when along with it the influ­ <lb/>
            ence of disease makes its way in from without, they both withdraw <lb/>
            respectively to heaven and earth and there work their wills, since <lb/>
            there is nothing at all that is not of a rare texture of body.</p>
          <p>Furthermore all bodies whatever which are discharged from <lb/>
            things are not qualified to excite the same sensations nor are <lb/>
            adapted for all things alike. The sun for instance bakes and dries <pb n="176"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="962—1007"/> <lb/>
            up the earth, but thaws ice, and forces the snows piled up high <lb/>
            on the high hills to melt away beneath his rays; wax again <lb/>
            turns to liquid when placed within reach of his heat. Fire also <lb/>
            melts brass and fuses gold, but shrivels up and draws together <lb/>
            hides and flesh. The liquid of water after tire hardens steel, but <lb/>
            softens hides and flesh hardened by heat. The wild olive delights <lb/>
            the bearded she-goats as much as if the flavour it yielded were of <lb/>
            ambrosia and steeped in nectar; but nothing that puts forth leaf <lb/>
            is more bitter to man than this food. Again a swine eschews <lb/>
            marjoram-oil and dreads all perfumes; for they are rank poison to <lb/>
            bristly swine, though they are found at times to give us as it were <lb/>
            fresh life. But on the other hand though mire is to us the nastiest <lb/>
            filth, it is found to be so welcome to swine that they wallow in it <lb/>
            all over with a craving not to be satisfied.</p>
          <p>There is still one point left which it seems proper to mention, <lb/>
            before I come to speak of the matter in hand. Since many pores <lb/>
            are assigned to various things, they must possess natures differing <lb/>
            the one from the other and must have each its own nature, its own <lb/>
            direction: thus there are in living creatures various senses, each of <lb/>
            which takes into it in its own peculiar way its own special object; <lb/>
            for we see that sounds pass into one thing, taste from different <lb/>
            flavours into another thing, smells into another. Again one thing <lb/>
            is seen to stream through stones and another thing to pass through <lb/>
            woods, another through gold, and another still to go out through <lb/>
            silver and brass; for form is seen to stream through this passage, <lb/>
            heat through that, and one thing is seen to pass through by <lb/>
            the same way more quickly than other things. The nature of the <lb/>
            passages, you are to know, compels it so to be, varying in manifold <lb/>
            wise, as we have shewn a little above, owing to the unlike nature <lb/>
            and textures of things.</p>
          <p>Therefore now that these points have all been established and <lb/>
            arranged for us as premisses ready to our hand, for what remains, <lb/>
            the law will easily be explained out of them, and the whole cause <lb/>
            be laid open which attracts the strength of iron. First of all <lb/>
            there must stream from this stone very many seeds or a current <lb/>
            if you will which dispels with blows all the air which lies between <lb/>
            the stone and iron. When this space is emptied and much room <lb/>
            left void between, forthwith the first-beginnings of iron fall head­ <lb/>
            long forward into the void in one mass, and in consequence the <pb n="177"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="1008—1050"/> <lb/>
            ring itself follows and then goes on with its whole body. And <lb/>
            nothing has its primal elements more intricately entangled or <lb/>
            coheres in closer connexion than the nature of stubborn iron and <lb/>
            its coldness that makes you shiver. Therefore what I say is the <lb/>
            less strange, that from among such elements as these bodies can­ <lb/>
            not gather in large numbers out of the iron and be carried into <lb/>
            the void without the whole ring following. This it does do, and <lb/>
            follows on until it has quite reached the stone and fastened on it <lb/>
            with unseen bonds of connexion. The same thing takes place in <lb/>
            all directions: on whatever side a void is formed, whether athwart <lb/>
            or from above the first bodies next it are at once carried on into <lb/>
            the void; for they are set in motion by blows from another <lb/>
            source and cannot by their own free act rise up into the air. <lb/>
            Moreover (to render it more feasible, this thing also is helped <lb/>
            on by external aid and motion) as soon as the air in front of the <lb/>
            ring has been made rarer and the space more empty and void, <lb/>
            it follows at once that all the air which lies behind, carries and <lb/>
            pushes it on as it were at its back. For the air which lies <lb/>
            around them always beats on things; but at such a time as <lb/>
            this it is able to push on the iron, because on one side a space <lb/>
            is void and receives the iron into it. This air of which I am <lb/>
            speaking to you makes its way with much subtlety through the <lb/>
            frequent pores of the iron to its minute parts and then thrusts <lb/>
            and pushes it on, as the wind a ship and its sails. Again all <lb/>
            things must have air in their body, since they are of a rare body <lb/>
            and air surrounds and is in contact with all things. This air <lb/>
            therefore which is in the inmost recesses of the iron, is ever <lb/>
            stirred in restless motion and therefore beats the ring without a <lb/>
            doubt and stirs it within, you know: the ring is carried in the <lb/>
            direction in which it has once plunged forward, and into the void <lb/>
            part towards which it has made its start.</p>
          <p>Sometimes too it happens that the nature of iron is repelled <lb/>
            from this stone, being in the habit of flying from and following <lb/>
            it in turns. I have seen Samothracian iron rings even jump up, <lb/>
            and at the same time filings of iron rave within brass basins, <lb/>
            when this Magnet stone had been placed under: such a strong <lb/>
            desire the iron seems to have to fly from the stone. So great a <lb/>
            disturbance is raised by the interposition of the brass, because <lb/>
            sure enough when the current of the brass has first seized on <note type="footnote"> M. III. </note> <note type="footnote"> M </note> <lb/>
            <pb n="178"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="1050—1089"/><lb/>
            and taken possession of the open passages of the iron, the cur­ <lb/>
            rent of the stone comes after and finds all things full in the iron <lb/>
            and has no opening to swim through as before. It is forced there­ <lb/>
            fore to dash against and beat with its wave the iron texture; by <lb/>
            which means it repels from it and sets in motion through the <lb/>
            brass that which without the brass it often draws to itself. And <lb/>
            forbear herein to wonder that the current from this stone is not <lb/>
            able to set in motion other things as well as iron: some of these <lb/>
            stand still by the power of their own weight; for instance gold; <lb/>
            and others, because they are of so rare a body that the current <lb/>
            flies through them uninterrupted, cannot in any case be set in <lb/>
            motion; to which class wood is found to belong. When therefore <lb/>
            the nature of iron lying between the two has received into it cer­ <lb/>
            tain first bodies of brass, then do the Magnet stones set it in <lb/>
            motion with their stream.</p>
          <p>And yet these cases are not so much at variance with other <lb/>
            things, that I have only a scanty store of similar instances to <lb/>
            relate of things mutually fitted one for the other and for nothing <lb/>
            else: stones for instance you see are cemented by mortar alone; <lb/>
            wood is united with wood so firmly by bulls' glue only, that the <lb/>
            veins of boards often gape in cracks before the binding power <lb/>
            of the glue can be brought to loosen its hold. Vine-born juices <lb/>
            venture to mix with streams of water, though heavy pitch and <lb/>
            light oil cannot. Again the purple dye of the shellfish so unites <lb/>
            with the body of wool alone, that it cannot in any case be severed, <lb/>
            not were you to take pains to undo what is done with Neptune's <lb/>
            wave, not if the whole sea were willed to wash it out with all its <lb/>
            waters. Then too is there not one thing only that fastens gold to <lb/>
            gold, and is not brass soldered to brass by tin ? and how many <lb/>
            other cases of the kind might one find! what then ? you have no <lb/>
            need whatever of such long circuitous roads, nor is it worth my <lb/>
            while to spend so much pains on this, but it is better briefly to <lb/>
            comprise many things in few words: things whose textures have <lb/>
            such a mutual correspondence, that cavities fit solids, the cavities <lb/>
            of the first the solids of the second, the cavities of the second <lb/>
            the solids of the first, form the closest union. Again some things <lb/>
            may be fastened together and held in union with hooks and eyes <lb/>
            as it were ; and this seems rather to be the case with this stone <lb/>
            and iron.</p><pb n="179"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="1090—1130"/> And now I will explain what the law of diseases is and from <lb/>
            what causes the force of disease may suddenly gather itself up <lb/>
            and bring death-dealing destruction on the race of man and the <lb/>
            troops of brute beasts. And first I have shewn above that there <lb/>
            are seeds of many things helpful to our life; and on the other <lb/>
            hand many must fly about conducing to disease and death. When <lb/>
            these by chance have happened to gather together and have dis­ <lb/>
            ordered the atmosphere, the air becomes distempered. And all <lb/>
            that force of disease and that pestilence come either from without <lb/>
            down through the atmosphere in the shape of clouds and mists, or <lb/>
            else do gather themselves up and rise out of the earth, when <lb/>
            soaked with wet it has contracted a taint, being beaten upon by <lb/>
            unseasonable rains and suns. See you not too that all who come <lb/>
            to a place far away from country and home are affected by the <lb/>
            strangeness of climate and water, because there are wide differ­ <lb/>
            ences in such things ? for what a difference may we suppose be­ <lb/>
            tween the climate of the Briton and that of Egypt where the pole <lb/>
            of heaven slants askew, and again between that in Pontus and <lb/>
            that of Gades and so on to the races of men black with sun- <lb/>
            baked complexion ? Now as we see these four climates under the <lb/>
            four opposite winds and quarters of heaven all differing from each <lb/>
            other, so also the complexions and faces of the men are seen to <lb/>
            differ widely and diseases varying in kind are found to seize upon <lb/>
            the different races. There is the elephant disease which is gene <lb/>
            rated beside the streams of Nile in the midst of Egypt and no­ <lb/>
            where else. In Attica the feet are attacked and the eyes in <lb/>
            Achaean lands. And so different places are hurtful to different <lb/>
            parts and members : the variations of air occasion that. Therefore <lb/>
            when an atmosphere which happens to put itself in motion un­ <lb/>
            suited to us and a hurtful air begin to advance, they creep slowly <lb/>
            on in the shape of mist and cloud and disorder everything in their <lb/>
            line of advance and compel all to change ; and when they have at <lb/>
            length reached our atmosphere, they corrupt it too and make it <lb/>
            like to themselves and unsuited to us. This new destroying power <lb/>
            and pestilence therefore all at once either fall upon the waters or <lb/>
            else sink deep into the corn-crops or other food of man and pro­ <lb/>
            vender of beast; or else their force remains suspended within the <lb/>
            atmosphere, and when we inhale from it mixed airs, we must <lb/>
            absorb at the same time into our body those things as well. In <pb n="180"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="1131—1173"/> <lb/>
            like manner pestilence often falls on kine also and a distemper <lb/>
            too on the silly sheep. And it makes no difference whether we <lb/>
            travel to places unfavourable to us and change the atmosphere <lb/>
            which wraps us round, or whether nature without our choice brings <lb/>
            to us a tainted atmosphere or something to the use of which we <lb/>
            have not been accustomed, and which is able to attack us on its <lb/>
            first arrival.</p>
          <p>Such a form of disease and a death-fraught miasm erst within <lb/>
            the borders of Cecrops defiled the whole land with dead, and dis­ <lb/>
            peopled the streets, drained the town of burghers. Rising first <lb/>
            and starting from the inmost corners of Egypt, after traversing <lb/>
            much air and many floating fields, the plague brooded at last over <lb/>
            the whole people of Pandion ; and then they were handed over in <lb/>
            troops to- disease and death. First of all they would have the <lb/>
            head seized with burning heat and both eyes blood-shot with a <lb/>
            glare diffused over; the livid throat within would exude blood and <lb/>
            the passage of the voice be clogged and choked with ulcers, and <lb/>
            the mind's interpreter the tongue drip with gore, quite enfeebled <lb/>
            with sufferings, heavy in movement, rough to touch. Next when <lb/>
            the force of disease passing down the throat had filled the breast <lb/>
            and had streamed together even into the sad heart of the suffer­ <lb/>
            ers, then would all the barriers of life give way. The breath <lb/>
            would pour out at the mouth a noisome stench, even as the stench <lb/>
            of rotting carcases thrown out unburied. And then the powers of <lb/>
            the entire mind, the whole body would sink utterly, now on the <lb/>
            very threshold of death. And a bitter bitter despondency was the <lb/>
            constant attendant on insufferable ills and complaining mingled <lb/>
            with moaning. An ever-recurring hiccup often the night and day <lb/>
            through, forcing on continual spasms in sinews and limbs, would <lb/>
            break men quite, forwearying those forspent before. And yet in <lb/>
            none could you perceive the skin on the surface of the body burn <lb/>
            with any great heat, but the body would rather offer to the hand <lb/>
            a lukewarm sensation and at the same time be red all over with <lb/>
            ulcers burnt into it so to speak, like unto the holy fire as it <lb/>
            spreads over the frame. The inward parts of the men however <lb/>
            would burn to the very bones, a flame would burn within the <lb/>
            stomach as within furnaces. Nothing was light and thin enough <lb/>
            to apply to the relief of the body of any one; ever wind and cold <lb/>
            alone. Many would plunge their limbs burning with disease into <lb/>
            <pb n="181"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="1173—1278"/><lb/>
            the cool rivers, throwing their body naked into the water. Many <lb/>
            tumbled headforemost deep down into the wells, meeting the <lb/>
            water straight with mouth wide-agape. Parching thirst with a <lb/>
            craving not to be appeased, drenching their bodies, would make <lb/>
            an abundant draught no better than the smallest drop. No res­ <lb/>
            pite was there of ill: their bodies would lie quite spent. The <lb/>
            healing art would mutter low in voiceless fear, as again and again <lb/>
            they rolled about their eye-balls wide open, burning with disease, <lb/>
            never visited by sleep. And many symptoms of death besides <lb/>
            would then be given, the mind disordered in sorrow and fear, the <lb/>
            clouded brow, the fierce delirious expression, the ears too troubled <lb/>
            and filled with ringings, the breathing quick or else strangely loud <lb/>
            and slow-recurring, and the sweat glistening wet over the neck, <lb/>
            the spittle in thin small flakes, tinged with a saffron-colour, salt, <lb/>
            scarce forced up the rough throat by coughing. The tendons of <lb/>
            the hands ceased not to contract, the limbs to shiver, a coldness <lb/>
            to mount with slow sure pace from the feet upwards. Then at <lb/>
            their very last moments they had nostrils pinched, the tip of the <lb/>
            nose sharp, eyes deep-sunk, temples hollow, the skin cold and <lb/>
            hard, on the grim mouth a grin, the brow tense and swollen; <lb/>
            and not long after their limbs would be stretched stiff in death: <lb/>
            about the eighth day of bright sunlight or else on the ninth re­ <lb/>
            turn of his lamp they would yield up life. And if any of them at <lb/>
            that time had shunned the doom of death, yet in after time con­ <lb/>
            sumption and death would await him from noisome ulcers and the <lb/>
            black discharge of the bowels, or else a quantity of purulent blood <lb/>
            accompanied by headache would often pass out by the gorged nos­ <lb/>
            trils: into these the whole strength and substance of the man <lb/>
            would stream. Then too if any one had escaped the acrid dis­ <lb/>
            charge of noisome blood, the disease would yet pass into his sinews <lb/>
            and joints and onward even into the sexual organs of the body; <lb/>
            and some from excessive dread of the gates of death would live <lb/>
            bereaved of these parts by the knife; and some though without <lb/>
            hands and feet would continue in life, and some would lose their <lb/>
            eyes: with such force had the fear of death come upon them. <lb/>
            And some were seized with such utter loss of memory that they <lb/>
            did not know themselves. And though bodies lay in heaps above <lb/>
            bodies unburied on the ground, yet would the race of birds and <lb/>
            beasts either scour far away, to escape the acrid stench, or where <lb/>
            <pb n="182"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="1278—1261"/><lb/>
            any one had tasted, it drooped in near-following death. Though <lb/>
            hardly at all in those days would any bird appear, or the sullen <lb/>
            breeds of wild beasts quit the forests. Many would droop with <lb/>
            disease and die: above all faithful dogs would lie stretched in all <lb/>
            the streets and yield up breath with a struggle; for the power of <lb/>
            disease would wrench life from their frame. Funerals lonely, un­ <lb/>
            attended, would be hurried on with emulous haste. And no sure <lb/>
            and general method of cure was found; for that which had given <lb/>
            to one man the power to inhale the vital air and to gaze on the <lb/>
            quarters of heaven, would be destruction to others and would <lb/>
            bring on death. But in such times this was what was deplorable <lb/>
            and above all eminently heart-rending: when a man saw himself <lb/>
            enmeshed by the disease, as though he were doomed to death, <lb/>
            losing all spirit he would lie with sorrow-stricken heart, and with <lb/>
            his thoughts turned on death would surrender his life then and <lb/>
            there. Ay for at no time did they cease to catch from one an­ <lb/>
            other the infection of the devouring plague, like to woolly flocks <lb/>
            and horned herds. And this above all heaped death on death : <lb/>
            whenever any refused to attend their own sick, killing neglect <lb/>
            soon after would punish them for their too great love of life and <lb/>
            fear of death by a foul and evil death, abandoned in turn, forlorn <lb/>
            of help. But they who had stayed by them, would perish by in­ <lb/>
            fection and the labour which shame would then compel them to <lb/>
            undergo and the sick man's accents of affection mingled with <lb/>
            those of complaining: this kind of death the most virtuous would <lb/>
            meet. * * and different bodies on different piles, struggling as <lb/>
            they did to bury the multitude of their dead: then spent with <lb/>
            tears and grief they would go home; and in great part they would <lb/>
            take to their bed from sorrow. And none could be found whom <lb/>
            at so fearful a time neither disease nor death nor mourning <lb/>
            assailed.</p>
          <p>Then too every shepherd and herdsman, ay and sturdy guider <lb/>
            of the bent plough sickened; and their bodies would lie huddled <lb/>
            together in the corners of a hut, delivered over to death by po­ <lb/>
            verty and disease. Sometimes you might see lifeless bodies of <lb/>
            parents above their lifeless children, and then the reverse of this, <lb/>
            children giving up life above their mothers and fathers. And in <lb/>
            no small measure that affliction streamed from the land into the <lb/>
            town, brought thither by the sickening crowd of peasants meeting <pb n="183"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="1261—1286"/> <lb/>
            plague-stricken from every side. They would fill all places and <lb/>
            buildings: wherefore all the more the heat would [destroy, them <lb/>
            and] thus close-packed death would pile them up in heaps. <lb/>
            Many bodies drawn forth by thirst and tumbled out along the <lb/>
            street would lie extended by the fountains of water, the breath <lb/>
            of life cut off from their too great delight in water; and over all <lb/>
            the open places of the people and the streets you might see many <lb/>
            limbs drooping with their half-lifeless body, foul with stench and <lb/>
            covered with rags, perish away from filth of body, with nothing <lb/>
            but skin on their bones, now nearly buried in noisome sores and <lb/>
            dirt. All the holy sanctuaries of the gods too death had filled <lb/>
            with lifeless bodies, and all the temples of the heavenly powers <lb/>
            in all parts stood burdened with carcases: all which places the <lb/>
            wardens had thronged with guests. For now no longer the wor­ <lb/>
            ship of the gods or their divinities were greatly regarded: so <lb/>
            overmastering was the present affliction. Nor did those rites of <lb/>
            sepulture continue in force in the city, with which that pious folk <lb/>
            had always been wont to be buried; for the whole of it was in dis­ <lb/>
            may and confusion, and each man would sorrowfully bury as the <lb/>
            present moment allowed. And the sudden pressure and poverty <lb/>
            prompted to many frightful acts; thus with a loud uproar they <lb/>
            would place their own kinsfolk upon the funeral piles of others, <lb/>
            and apply torches, quarrelling often with much bloodshed sooner <lb/>
            than abandon the bodies.</p>
