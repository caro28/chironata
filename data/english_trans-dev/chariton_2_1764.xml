            <lb/>
            IN what manner Callirrhoe, the love­ <lb/>
            lieft of women, was joined in wed­ <lb/>
            lock, under the aufpices of Venus, <lb/>
            to Chæreas the most handsome among men: <lb/>
            and how, being thought dead on occasion of <lb/>
            a violent blow given her by Chæreas, in a <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> B </note> <lb/>
            fit <lb/>
             <pb n="2"/>
            fit of jealoufy, she was magnificently inter­ <lb/>
            red : How afterwards recovering, pyrates <lb/>
            drew her, in the dead of night, out of the <lb/>
            sepulchre; and crossing the fea, fold her in <lb/>
            Ionia to Dionyfius : His paffion for Callir­ <lb/>
            rhoe; her fidelity to Chasreas ; and the necef­ <lb/>
            fity the was under, on account of her preg­ <lb/>
            nancy, to marry again : Theron's confeffion ; <lb/>
            with Chæreas's voyage, in order to feek his <lb/>
            wife : His captivity with Polycharmus; <lb/>
            and their being fold in Caria : How Mithri­ <lb/>
            dates knew Chæreas again, just as he was <lb/>
            going to suffer ; and the strong endeavours <lb/>
            used by the former, to- unite the fevered to­ <lb/>
            vers: In what manner Dionysius, having dif­ <lb/>
            covered thefe particulars, by means of let­ <lb/>
            ters, accufed Mithridates to Pharnaces ; and <lb/>
            how the latter informed against Mithridates <lb/>
            to the king. Lastly, how the monarch sum­ <lb/>
            moned both the parties to take their trial- <lb/>
            All <lb/>
             <pb n="3"/>
            All thefe incidents have been related ; and <lb/>
            we now proceed to the fequel of the story.— <lb/>
            Callirrhoe was not difpleafed with her voyage <lb/>
            till her arrival in Cilicia, as she had hitherto <lb/>
            heard the Greek language fpoke; and could <lb/>
            fee that part of the ocean which flows to­ <lb/>
            wards Syracpfe : but when the came to the <lb/>
            Euphrates, on the other fide whereof is a <lb/>
            continent subject to the king of Perfia, stretch­ <lb/>
            ing out a vaft length ; she then began to sigh <lb/>
            for her native country, and her relations ; and <lb/>
            despaired of ever returning again to them. <lb/>
            Hereupon, Handing on the banks of the <lb/>
            river, the ordered all her attendants to retire, <lb/>
            her faithful Plangon excepted, and then <lb/>
            poured forth thefe words; O envious <lb/>
            Fortune ! too obstinately bent to persecute <lb/>
            a haplefs, forlorn woman. Thou didst shut <lb/>
            me up in a sepulchre; and deliver me thence, <lb/>
            not out of pity, but to put me into the hands <note type="footnote"> B 2 </note> <lb/>
            of <lb/>
             <pb n="4"/>
            of pyrates. Theron, and the ocean, divid­ <lb/>
            ed my flight between them. I, though the <lb/>
            daughter of Hermocrates, was fold; and <lb/>
            what is still more grievous to me than bon­ <lb/>
            dage, have been beloved ; and, in Chæreas's <lb/>
            life-time, married to another man. Yet <lb/>
            thou now envieft me even thefe nuptials. <lb/>
            Thou doft not banish me to Ionia. I <lb/>
            there, indeed, was in a foreign land; but <lb/>
            then its inhabitants were Greeks; and I had <lb/>
            the fond consolation to dwell in the neigh­ <lb/>
            bourhood of the sea. Thou doll- now force <lb/>
            me from the accustomed air which I firft <lb/>
            breathed; and a whole world lies between <lb/>
            me and my native country. Thou doft drive <lb/>
            me from Miletus, as before from Syracuse. <lb/>
            I, born an islander, am dragged over the <lb/>
            Euphrates; and fhut up in the interior parts <lb/>
            of a barbarous country ; which no fea wa(hes. <lb/>
            What hopes have I, that a Sicilian ship will <lb/>
            ever <lb/>
             <pb n="5"/>
            ever fail this way ? 0 my Chæreas ! I am <lb/>
            even fevered from thy sepulchre. Excellent <lb/>
            Manes! Who will henceforward offer up fa­ <lb/>
            crifices to thee? Bactra and Sufa will, for <lb/>
            ever after, be my habitation and my grave. <lb/>
            O Euphrates! never shall I crofs thy flood <lb/>
            again. I do not fo much dread the length <lb/>
            of the journey, as the misfortune of my ap­ <lb/>
            pearing, there, beautiful in the eyes of tome <lb/>
            one.—— Having faid thefe words, the kissed <lb/>
            the earth ; and then going on board, crossed <lb/>
            the river. Dionyfius had a grand retinue, <lb/>
            and fplendor shone in every part of it; he <lb/>
            being refolved to exhibit, to his wife, the <lb/>
            utmoft magnificence on this occafion ; which <lb/>
            alfo might make him more acceptable to the <lb/>
            king. He met with universal courtesy in <lb/>
            his progrefs; the people of one province <lb/>
            conducting him to the next; and each go­ <lb/>
            vernor recommending him to the neighbour- <note type="footnote"> B 3 </note> <lb/>
            ing. <lb/>
             <pb n="6"/>
            ing one: for Callirrhoe's beauty fascinated <lb/>
            and enflaved every beholder. Thofe Barba­ <lb/>
            rians were likewise in hopes, that this wo­ <lb/>
            man would one day be very powerful. Hence <lb/>
            all were extremely defirous of entertaining <lb/>
            them in their houfes; and, by laying her <lb/>
            under obligations, they expected a return of <lb/>
            favour. Thus were matters circumstanced at <lb/>
            this juncture.</p>
          <p>II. But Mithridates was more expeditious <lb/>
            in his progrefs, which was through Armenia; <lb/>
            he being apprehensive that, should he go the <lb/>
            fame road with Callirrhoe, and immediately <lb/>
            after her, this would be represented, to the <lb/>
            king, as an argument of his guilt. He alfo <lb/>
            was very desirous of arriving first, in order <lb/>
            that he might have time to prepare every <lb/>
            thing necessary for, and of advantage to, his <lb/>
            trial. Being come to Babylon, where the <lb/>
            king <lb/>
             <pb n="7"/>
            king then resided ; Mithridates ftaid at home <lb/>
            all that day, and devoted it wholly to rest ; <lb/>
            each governor having his particular quarter <lb/>
            aligned him. On the morrow he went to <lb/>
            court, where he firft vifited thofe of his own <lb/>
            rank, who are called Homotimi. After hav­ <lb/>
            ing faluted the eunuch Artaxates, and pre­ <lb/>
            rented gifts to him; he being in a moft ex­ <lb/>
            alted station, and very powerful with the <lb/>
            king ;—O Artaxates! (faid he) fpeak thus <lb/>
            to my liege. Mithridates, thy Servant, is come <lb/>
            hither, in order to clear himfelf from the <lb/>
            accufation brought againft him by the Greek; <lb/>
            and to fall profirate before his fovereign.—— <lb/>
            Artaxates coming out a little after, brought <lb/>
            the following answer : That the king ad­ <lb/>
            vifed Mithridates not. to prevaricate; and, <lb/>
            with regard to the trial, that it would be <lb/>
            entered upon fo foon as Dionyfius should ar­ <lb/>
            rive.—Mithridates then paid his adoration, <note type="footnote"> B 4 </note> <lb/>
            and <lb/>
             <pb n="8"/>
            and went away. Being returned to his lodg­ <lb/>
            ings, and alone, he fent for Chæreas, and <lb/>
            spake thus :—I am persecuted, and charged <lb/>
            with a defign to reftore Callirrhoe to thee: <lb/>
            for Dionyfius declares, that the letter which <lb/>
            thou didft write to thy wife, was drawn up <lb/>
            by me ; and imagines, that he has got evi­ <lb/>
            dent proofs of an adulterous commerce. He <lb/>
            is firmly persuaded, that thou art dead; and <lb/>
            let him continue in that belief, till the day <lb/>
            of the trial; that thou mayeft then appear <lb/>
            on a fudden, and unexpectedly. One re­ <lb/>
            queft I have to make, in return for my great <lb/>
            kindness to thee, viz. that thou wouldeft <lb/>
            have so much patience as to lie concealed; <lb/>
            and to forbear feeing Callirrhoe, or even <lb/>
            making the leaft enquiry concerning her. <lb/>
            Chæreas obeyed, though with the utmoft <lb/>
            reluctance ; and fpite of his violent struggle, <lb/>
            to conceal the fecrets of his foul, yet tears <lb/>
            gushed <lb/>
             <pb n="9"/>
            gushed infenfibly from his eyes; whereupon <lb/>
            he thus replied: ——My Lord! Thy com­ <lb/>
            mands shall be obeyed.. Then retiring to <lb/>
            the apartment where he, and his friend Poly­ <lb/>
            charmus, lodged; Chæreas threw himself <lb/>
            on the floor, and tore his garments; after <lb/>
            which,</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">Distracted : with his hands be ashes scoop'd Of jetty hue ; then cast them o'er his head; And thus the beauty of his face deform'd.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Then weeping, said :O my Callirrhoe ! <lb/>
            We are near ; and yet muft not fee each <lb/>
            other. But this is no ways thy fault, as <lb/>
            thou knowest not that Chæreas is still alive. <lb/>
            But I am the moft wicked of men, who, <lb/>
            . being bid not to fee thee; am yet fo much <lb/>
            a coward, and fo fond of life, as tamely <lb/>
            to Submit to a tyrannical order: whereas, <lb/>
            had <lb/>
             <pb n="10"/>
            had fuch an injunction been laid on thee, thou <lb/>
            wouldeft have died.—Polycharmus employed <lb/>
            the most toothing wolds, in hopes of con­ <lb/>
            doling him ; about which time Dionyfius was <lb/>
            advanced pretty near to Babylon. Fame had <lb/>
            previoufly filled the city with the news of <lb/>
            the approach of the woman, whose beauty <lb/>
            was not human, but rather of the celestial <lb/>
            kind ; and fuch as Sol did not behold in his <lb/>
            mighty progress. As the Barbarians are, by <lb/>
            nature, distractedly fond of females, every <lb/>
            houfe, and every ftreet echoed with this re­ <lb/>
            port ; which reaching the king's ear, he <lb/>
            asked the eunuch Artaxates, whether the Mi­ <lb/>
            lesian woman was come. Dionysius had long <lb/>
            felt great uneasinefs, on account of his wife's <lb/>
            being fo universally talked of ; a circumstance <lb/>
            that prevented his enjoying, with Security, <lb/>
            the happinefs he really possest ; but when <lb/>
            he reflected that he was going to Babylon, <lb/>
            he <lb/>
             <pb n="11"/>
            he was not merely grieved, but all on fire; <lb/>
            whereupon, venting a deep figh, he groaned <lb/>
            thus within himself : Thou art not now <lb/>
            (0 Dionyfius !) in Miletus, thine own coun­ <lb/>
            try. Even there thou wert afraid of se- <lb/>
            ducers. How then couldest thou be fo rati, <lb/>
            fo thoughtless of futurity, as thy felf to <lb/>
            take Callirrhoe to Babylon, where are so <lb/>
            many Mithridates's ? In Sparta, that city so <lb/>
            renowned for the chastity of its morals, Me­ <lb/>
            nelaus could not keep Helen wholly to him­ <lb/>
            self ; but found a rival in a barbarous shep­ <lb/>
            herd. Many a Paris is met with in Persia. <lb/>
            Perceived thou not the dangers ? Seest thou <lb/>
            not the prelude to thefe things ? Entire cities <lb/>
            come forth to meet us, and governors lavish <lb/>
            their favours upon us. This has already <lb/>
            fwelled Callirrhoe's pride, though the king <lb/>
            has not yet seen her. The only way then left <lb/>
            for thee to keep thy wife, will be to conceal <lb/>
            her. <lb/>
             <pb n="12"/>
            her. If (he can but be hid, I shall Secure her <lb/>
            to my felf. Having thus reasoned in his <lb/>
            own mind, he mounted on horfeback, and <lb/>
            left Callirrhoe alone in the chariot, after <lb/>
            drawing the curtains round her. And had <lb/>
            it not been for an incident which happened, <lb/>
            his defires would very probably have been <lb/>
            accomplished.</p>
          <p>III. The wives of the greater Persian <lb/>
            Lords went to Statira, the king's contort <lb/>
            when one of them thus addressed her: <lb/>
            Royal lady I a contemptible, female Grecian, <lb/>
            our enemy, who has long been the subject of <lb/>
            univerfal admiration, is coming hither. We <lb/>
            are in danger (and that through our own <lb/>
            fault,) of lofing, in this age, the glory which <lb/>
            fo highly distinguishes the Persian fair. Let <lb/>
            us rouze then, and consider how we may pre­ <lb/>
            vent our beauty, and the reputation of it, <lb/>
            from <lb/>
             <pb n="13"/>
            from being obfcured by this female fo­ <lb/>
            reigner.—The queen fmiled at thefe words; <lb/>
            she giving little credit to the report, and <lb/>
            fpake thus :The Greeks are vain, and <lb/>
            pay no regard to truth ; they making the moft <lb/>
            trifling things the subject of admiration; <lb/>
            whence they loudly pronounce Callirrhoe <lb/>
            lovely, and Dionyfius rich. When therefore <lb/>
            she fhall be arrived in the city, let one of us <lb/>
            come forth, and eclipfe at once the imaginary <lb/>
            charms of that mean, Insignificant slave.— <lb/>
            All the ladies paid adoration to the queen; <lb/>
            and admiring her wifdom, they cried aloud, <lb/>
            as with one voice: Would (0 queen!) <lb/>
            that thou mighteft be feen in public. <lb/>
            They afterwards differed very much in opi­ <lb/>
            nion ; on which occasion many women, re- <lb/>
            Downed for their exquifite charms, being <lb/>
            named; they proceeded to the election, as <lb/>
            in a theatre ; when Rhodogune, daughter <lb/>
            to <lb/>
             <pb n="14"/>
            to Zopyrus, and wife to Megabyzus, was <lb/>
            chosen ; she being a model of perfect beauty, <lb/>
            and as renowned all over Alia, as Callirrhoe <lb/>
            was throughout Ionia. Hereupon the ladies <lb/>
            led forth the chofen fair, and began to deck <lb/>
            her ; each contributing fome trinket, or other <lb/>
            ornament, for that purpose. The queen <lb/>
            alfo presented her with bracelets and collars. <lb/>
            Being thus fplendidly arrayed, and prepared <lb/>
            for the congress ; she fet out, in high Spirits, <lb/>
            to meet Callirrhoe; which she likewise was <lb/>
            induced to do from a family motive; Rhodo­ <lb/>
            gune being sister to Pharnaces, he who had <lb/>
            writ to the king concerning Dionyfius. All <lb/>
            Babylon came forth to this fpeaacle; inso­ <lb/>
            much that the crouds stopt the passages at the <lb/>
            several gates. Rhodogune being conducted <lb/>
            out of the palace, and attended by a princely <lb/>
            train, stopt on an eminence very vifible on <lb/>
            every side ; when, assuming the moft affected <lb/>
             <note type="footnote">2</note> <lb/>
            airs, <lb/>
             <pb n="15"/>
            airs, she deemed to challenge the approaching <lb/>
            stranger. Instantly she attracted all eyes, <lb/>
            when one said to another :We are con­ <lb/>
            querors ! The Persian lady will eclipfe the <lb/>
            foreign woman. Let her vie with Rhodogune <lb/>
            if she can: Let the Greeks now learn, that <lb/>
            they are a compound of pride and vanity.- <lb/>
            While they were thus talking, Dionyfius ar­ <lb/>
            rived ; when being informed that the sister <lb/>
            of Pharnaces was present, he alighted im­ <lb/>
            mediately from his horfe ; and went up to <lb/>
            her, to pay his respects. Rhodogune, half <lb/>
            blufhing, faid: I muft falute my sister ; <lb/>
            and thereupon flew to the chariot. It was <lb/>
            now impossible to conceal Callirrhoe any <lb/>
            longer behind the curtains; so, that Dionysius <lb/>
            was forced, though with infinite reluctance ; <lb/>
            with fighs; and through fhame, to defire <lb/>
            his wife to alight. instantly the multitude <lb/>
            not only directed their glances, but fixed <lb/>
            their <lb/>
             <pb n="16"/>
            their very fouls, on Callirrhoe; infomuch that <lb/>
            they almost fell over one another; every one <lb/>
            longing to fee her firft ; and to get as near her <lb/>
            as possible. Her face then shone ; and its <lb/>
            lightning dazzled the eyes of every beholder; <lb/>
            like as when a ftrong effulgence bursts fud­ <lb/>
            denly from amid the gloom of night. The <lb/>
            Barbarians, now feized with astonishment, <lb/>
            worshipped her; and no one thought that <lb/>
            Rhodogune was present; who finding her <lb/>
            felf vanquished ; being unable to go forward, <lb/>
            and yet unwilling to flay behind, fhe stole <lb/>
            into the chariot to Callirrhoe ; and thus Sub­ <lb/>
            mitted to be carried off by her conqueror. <lb/>
            The chariot (whofe curtains were still drawn) <lb/>
            went forward: and the people, being now <lb/>
            deprived of the fight of Callirrhoe, blew <lb/>
            kisses after her. The king hearing of Dio­ <lb/>
            nyfius's arrival, commanded Artaxates the <lb/>
            eunuch to make the following declaration to <note type="footnote"> I </note> <lb/>
            him : <lb/>
             <pb n="17"/>
            him :— As thou haft brought a charge, <lb/>
            againft a man whom I entrusted with the go­ <lb/>
            vernment of a large province; thou shouldest <lb/>
            not have been to flow in thy journey. How­ <lb/>
            ever, I pardon thy fault, as thou didst travel <lb/>
            with thy wife. I now celebrate a festival, <lb/>
            and am chiefly employed in Sacrifices. Thirty <lb/>
            days hence I will hear thy fuit. Dionysius <lb/>
            paid his adoration, and withdrew.</p>
          <p>IV. Preparations for the trial began pre. <lb/>
            fently to be made, on both fides, as for a <lb/>
            mighty war. The Barbarians, in general, <lb/>
            were divided into two parties. All the go­ <lb/>
            vernors, and thofe who had any dependanoc <lb/>
            on them, were for Mithridates; he being <lb/>
            originally a Bactrian ; and lately come into <lb/>
            Caria. Dionyfius had the favour of the <lb/>
            common people; as fnares had been laid for <lb/>
            him, on occasion of his wife; and fuch a <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> c </note> <lb/>
            wife. <lb/>
             <pb n="18"/>
            wife as Callirrhoe: and especially as great <lb/>
            injury seemed to have been done him, con­ <lb/>
            trary to the laws. Neither were the Persian <lb/>
            women eafy on this occasion, they alb being <lb/>
            divided in opinion. Such of them as were <lb/>
            proud of their own charms, envied Callir­ <lb/>
            rhoe ; and wished, that the might be brought <lb/>
            to confusion at the trial. But moft of the <lb/>
            reft, being jealous of the beauties of their own <lb/>
            country, prayed that the foreigner might, <lb/>
            still maintain her shining reputation, and bear <lb/>
            away the palm. Both parties thought them- <lb/>
            (elves Cure of the victory. Dionyfius trusted <lb/>
            in the letters which Mithridates was fuppofed <lb/>
            to have writ to Callirrhoe, in Chareas's name, <lb/>
            whom he imagined to be dead : While, on <lb/>
            the other, hand, Mithridates could produce <lb/>
            Chæreas himself; and thence was firmly per­ <lb/>
            fuaded that no evil could befal him. He yet <lb/>
            pretended fear ; and engaged many advocates, <note type="footnote"> I </note> <lb/>
            in <lb/>
             <pb n="19"/>
            tn order that the unexpected issue might make <lb/>
            his defence the more glorious. During these <lb/>
            thirty days, the Perfians, both men and wo­ <lb/>
            men, talked of nothing but the trial; so <lb/>
            that, to fay the truth, all Babylon teemed as <lb/>
            one tribunal. The day appointed for the de­ <lb/>
            cifion appeared to have been too long de­ <lb/>
            layed ; not only to all the people, but even <lb/>
            to the king himfelf. What Olympic games, <lb/>
            what Eleufinian nights, were, at any time, <lb/>
            fo impatiently expected ? But now the day <lb/>
            of trial was come ; when the king took his <lb/>
            feat, in the apartment appointed Solely for <lb/>
            hearing causes; it being the most spacious, <lb/>
            and mod magnificent faloon, in the whole <lb/>
            palace. In the center of this falcon flood the <lb/>
            throne, with feats on each fide for the king's <lb/>
            friends; and for thofe who, either on ac­ <lb/>
            count of their rank, or of their virtues, pof­ <lb/>
            sessed the lirA employments in the govern­ <note type="footnote"> c 2 </note> <lb/>
            ment. <lb/>
             <pb n="20"/>
            merit. Round the throne flood the centu­ <lb/>
            rions, the Tribunes, and the most honourable <lb/>
            among the king's freedmen : whence it might <lb/>
            justly have been said, of this assembly, that,</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">The gods high-sented, round in perial Jove, Were met in council.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>The perfonages allowed seats, were introdu­ <lb/>
            ced with filence and respect. The morning <lb/>
            being come, Mithridates firft entered the court, <lb/>
            accompanied by his relations and friends j <lb/>
            not fplendidly drest, nor with an open, <lb/>
            chearful countenance; but, on the contrary, <lb/>
            discovering fuch a miferable aspect, as teemed <lb/>
            to pronounce him guilty. Dionyfius follow­ <lb/>
            ed in a Grecian habit, wearing a Milesian. <lb/>
            robe, and holding the letters in his hand. <lb/>
            Being introduced, they paid their adoration, <lb/>
            when the king commanded the fecretary to <lb/>
            read the letters; that of Pharnaces, and the <lb/>
            anfwer <lb/>
             <pb n="21"/>
            answer to it: in order that thofe who, with <lb/>
            himfelf, were to judge the caute, might be <lb/>
            made acquainted with the origin of the pro­ <lb/>
            cefs. The letters being read, the assembly <lb/>
            gave the higher testimonies of applaufe; all <lb/>
            admiring the moderation and justice of their <lb/>
            prince. Silence being proclaimed, Dionyfius <lb/>
            was to be heard firft, as the accuser ; when <lb/>
            all eyes were fixed upon him. Neverthelefs <lb/>
            Mithridates fpake thus :(O my Liege !) <lb/>
            I would not anticipate my defence, and know <lb/>
            well the order to be observed here ; but be­ <lb/>
            fore we proceed to the trial, it is necessary <lb/>
            that all the parties should be prefent. Where <lb/>
            then is the woman who gave occasion to this <lb/>
            contest? whofe pretence thou (Royal Sir!) <lb/>
            didft think necessary; whore appearance thou <lb/>
            did st command ; and who is come to this <lb/>
            city accordingly. Let not then Dionysius se­ <lb/>
            crete the perfon who is the chief, the first <note type="footnote"> C 3 </note> <lb/>
            cause, <lb/>
             <pb n="22"/>
            cause, of the prefect session.——Here Dio­ <lb/>
            nysius replied;——It is acting too like an <lb/>
            adulterer, to insist upon the bringing forth <lb/>
            another man's wife, before a gazing multi­ <lb/>
            tude, contrary to his will; she being neither <lb/>
            the accuser nor the person accufed. Had she <lb/>
            been feduced, she then ought to have been <lb/>
            present, as a culprit; but thou didft endea­ <lb/>
            vour to corrupt Callirrhoe, who was wholly <lb/>
            ignorant of thy machinations. But I do not <lb/>
            now want her, either as a witness or as an <lb/>
            advocate. What necessity then is there for <lb/>
            her forth coming, as she is wholly unconcern­ <lb/>
            ed in this process?——Thus argued Dio­ <lb/>
            nysius, as a man well verged in the civil law ; <lb/>
            but his fubtilty and Specious eloquence had <lb/>
            not the gift of perfuafion, because all longed <lb/>
            to fec Callirrhoe. As the king, though he <lb/>
            wifhed for the fame, yet did not think it be­ <lb/>
            coming his dignity to command her appear­ <lb/>
            ance ; <lb/>
             <pb n="23"/>
            ance ; his friends artfully referred to his let­ <lb/>
            ter, by which her prefence was declared ne­ <lb/>
            cessary.——Would it not be extremely abfurd <lb/>
            (cried one) should this woman, who is come <lb/>
            from Ionia, and now in Babylon, not make <lb/>
            her appearance at the trial ?——It being then <lb/>
            ;refolved that Callirrhoe fhould come forth; <lb/>
            Dionyfius, who had not told her a word con­ <lb/>
            cerning this affair, but even concealed the <lb/>
            true motive of their journey to Babylon j <lb/>
            fearing his wife's just anger, as she could not <lb/>
            but think herself impofed upon, fhould he <lb/>
            take her into court, without previously ac­ <lb/>
            quainting her with his reasons for this; he <lb/>
            therefore put off the trial, till next day, and <lb/>
            the court broke up.</p>
          <p>V. Dionyfius now returned home; and <lb/>
            being a wife man, and a scholar, he held <lb/>
            fuch difcourfes with his wife as suited the pre- <note type="footnote"> C 4 </note> <lb/>
            sent <lb/>
             <pb n="24"/>
            sent exigency. His arguments feemed plaufi­ <lb/>
            ble and perfuafive; he informing her, very <lb/>
            readily and with great composure of mind, <lb/>
            of each particular. Callirrhoe could not hear <lb/>
            him without tears; and, at the name of <lb/>
            Chæreas, the fighed and wept bitterly. And <lb/>
            now, shuddering at the thoughts of the trial, <lb/>
            there words burft from her: ——To complete <lb/>
            my wretchedness, the only thing wanting <lb/>
            was, for me to be dragged before the judge. <lb/>
            I have been laid in the sepulchre as dead, <lb/>
            and taken from thence by robbers: I have <lb/>
            been fold; have been in slavery: and now <lb/>
            (O Fortune!) I muft be forced to appear in <lb/>
            a court of judicature. It was not enough <lb/>
            that thou didft induce Chæreas to think me <lb/>
            guilty; but thou alfo muft expofe me to be <lb/>
            tried as an adulterer now I am married to <lb/>
            Dionyfius. By thy triumphant calumny, (O <lb/>
            Fortune!) I then was carried to the tomb; and <lb/>
            now <lb/>
             <pb n="25"/>
            now to the tribunal of a king. I am become <lb/>
            the jeft of Europe and of Alia. With what <lb/>
            eye shall I behold the judge ? What words <lb/>
            must I be contained to hear ? 0 treacherous <lb/>
            beauty! bestowed upon me by nature, only <lb/>
            that I might be loaded with flander. The <lb/>
            daughter of Hermocrates is Summoned to a <lb/>
            trial, where she has no father to plead her <lb/>
            caufe. Others, when they come before a <lb/>
            court, fupplicate its favour and good-will; <lb/>
            whereas, hapless I, am afraid of appearing too <lb/>
            agreeable in the eyes of my judge. ——Cal­ <lb/>

            ceived her nuptial day, and the whole city <lb/>
            crowned with chaplets; with. her parents <lb/>

             <lb/>
            leading her to the bridegroom's house. And <lb/>

            Numbers, and called to Plangon; for Dio­ <lb/>
            nysius had risen before, in order to meditate <lb/>
            upon the trial. Plangon after being told the <lb/>
            dream, fpake thus :Be comforted (my <lb/>
            good Lady!) This vision is aufpicious both <lb/>
            to thee, and to Chæreas. Let nothing trouble <lb/>
            thee. All that thou faweft in thy sleep, thou <lb/>
            wilt behold when awake. Go then to the <lb/>

            thy bridal charms.—Saying thefe words, the <lb/>
            dreft Callirrhoe very splendidly, who, from <lb/>
            a secret impulse, grew chearful on a sudden, <lb/>
            as an omen of her future felicity. In the <lb/>
            morning numberless multitudes flocked to the <lb/>
            palace, all the avenues to which were now <lb/>
            crowded. Every one seemed desirous of <lb/>
            hearing <lb/>
             <pb n="27"/>
            hearing the trial; but the real motive was to <lb/>
            get a fight of Callirrhoe; nor were they <lb/>
            deceived in their expectations; so far from <lb/>
            it, that she then as far surpassed herfelf in <lb/>

          <p>VI. Dionysius began his harangue in man­ <lb/>
            nor following. Most gracious Sovereign ! <lb/>
            I return thee all imaginable thanks for the <lb/>
            honour thou haft done me; and not only <lb/>
            me, but virtue also, and all married perfons <lb/>
            in general. For thou hast not contemned a <lb/>
            private man whom one of thy chief officers <lb/>
            has greatly injured; but, on the contrary, <lb/>
            hast fummoned him hither, to punish him for <lb/>
            his leudness, and his infolent conduit towards <lb/>
            me; and to prevent other men from attempt­ <lb/>
            ing the like actions for the future. But this <lb/>
            crime calls for a more fevere punishment, as <lb/>
            he who committed it is of high rank. Mi­ <lb/>
            thridates, who far from being my enemy, <lb/>
            was once my gueft and my friend, endea­ <lb/>
            voured to rob me, not of any part of my <lb/>
            elate, but of what I prize beyond body and <lb/>
            foul, even of my darling wife. This very <lb/>
            man ought to have aided me, had. any other <lb/>
            person <lb/>
             <pb n="29"/>
            person offered fuch an infult; if not for my <lb/>
            sake, at kail out of reverence to thee, (my <lb/>
            Liege!) Thou haft entrusted him with the <lb/>
            government of a mighty province; of which <lb/>
            he has proved himfelf unworthy ; and there­ <lb/>
            by betrays, and even reflects dishonour on <lb/>
            those who repofed fuch confidence in him. <lb/>
            I am not ignorant of the solicitations, the <lb/>
            power, and pomp, of which Mithridates <lb/>
            avails himfelf on occafion of the prefent <lb/>
            process. I know that I am not upon an equal <lb/>
            footing, with him, in thofe respects: I yet <lb/>
            rely, (0 mighty Prince !) on thy juftice ; on <lb/>
            the facred ties of marriage ; and on the laws <lb/>
            which thou doll adminifter impartially to all. <lb/>
            Sbouldeft thou difmifs Mithridates, it were <lb/>
            much better that he had never been fummon­ <lb/>
            ed hither; as otherwise all men would <lb/>
            have concluded, that injuries and infults <lb/>
            could never escape punishment, when brought <lb/>
            before <lb/>
             <pb n="30"/>
            before thy tribunal. But on the contrary, <lb/>
            should Mithridates, after being judged by <lb/>
            thee, be fuffered to depart with impunity; <lb/>
            thou wilt henceforward be contemned. My <lb/>
            caufe is clear and concife. I am hufband to <lb/>
            Callirrhoe, and the has made me a father. <lb/>
            I married her, not when a virgin, but the <lb/>
            widow of a certain Chæreas, who died fome <lb/>
            time since; and whore Mausolæum is now <lb/>
            standing in our country. Mithridates being <lb/>
            In Miletus, and my gueft; and having by <lb/>
            that means an opportunity of feeing, pursuant <lb/>
            to the laws of hospitality, my wife; he did <lb/>
            not behave afterwards as became a friend, a <lb/>
            modeft, or a worthy man; nor as thou re­ <lb/>
            quirest thole to do, to whom thou doll en­ <lb/>
            truft the government of thy cities: He, on <lb/>
            the contrary, acting with great infolence and <lb/>
            tyranny. Being afterwards fully convinced <lb/>
            of Callirrhoe's strict virtue, and her great <lb/>
            love <lb/>
             <pb n="31"/>
             <lb/>
            love for me, her hufband; and thence doubt­ <lb/>
            ing whether it would be possible for him to,. <lb/>
            win her, either by perfuafions or by rich <lb/>
            gifts; he (a moft crafty man !) had recourse <lb/>
            to wonderful artifices, as he imagined <lb/>
            them to be. Mithridates pretended that <lb/>
            Chæreas, her first husband, is still living; <lb/>
            and having forged a letter, to my wife, in his <lb/>
            name, he tent it to her by his fervants. Thy <lb/>
            fortune (mighty Monarch!) fuccoured me, <lb/>
            who, (I trust) am not unworthy of thy <lb/>
            countenance; and, by the providence of the <lb/>
            Gods, this letter was discovered: for Bias, <lb/>
            Prætor of Priene, fent it me, with the ser­ <lb/>
            vants who had it in charge. Having thus <lb/>
            detected Mithridates, I informed Phamaces,. <lb/>
            governor of Lydia and Ionia, of this matter: <lb/>
            when he acquainted thee (0 Prince!) with <lb/>
            the fame. I have here fet forth the whole <lb/>
            fact, of which thou art to judge. The <lb/>
            proofs <lb/>
             <pb n="32"/>
            proofs are inconteflible ; for either Chæreas <lb/>
            must be proved to be still living : or Mithri­ <lb/>
            dates mull: be convicted as an adulterer. He <lb/>
            cannot fay, that he is ignorant of Chæreas's <lb/>
            death; as we have raided a monument, to his <lb/>
            memory, in Miletus. Mithridates himfelf <lb/>
            was there, and accompanied the funeral pro­ <lb/>
            ceffion. But whenever he wants to seduce <lb/>
            another man's wife, he can easily raife the <lb/>
            dead. I will now only mention the letter <lb/>
            which he difpatched, by his fervants, from <lb/>
            Caria to Miletus. Do thou (secretary !) read <lb/>
            it ——I, Chæreas, am ftill living. Let Mi­ <lb/>
            thridates prove this, and then be let at li­ <lb/>
            berty. Reflect (O my Liege!) how audacious <lb/>
            that man must be, who dares to invent a fat­ <lb/>
            fity, even with regard to a person deceased.— <lb/>
            Thefe words, pronounced by Dionyfius, <lb/>
            firing the whole affembly, every voice was <lb/>
            instantly in his favour: when the king, in­ <lb/>
            flamed <lb/>
             <pb n="33"/>
            flamed with anger, darted a fierce and me­ <lb/>
            nacing look at Mithridates.</p>
          <p>VII. And now Mithridates, being no ways <lb/>
            difmayed, replied: ——I bereech thee (O my <lb/>
            king !) as thou art juft and merciful, not to <lb/>
            condemn me unheard: nor to permit calum­ <lb/>
            ny to triumph over truth; by thy giving cre­ <lb/>
            dit to the malicious fiction which a worthless <lb/>
            Greek has artfully invented concerning me. <lb/>
            I am fenfible, that the exquifite beauty of <lb/>
            Callirrhoe, may naturally raife a fufpicion of <lb/>
            me; as it does not feem unlikely, but that an <lb/>
            attempt may have been made to feduce her. <lb/>
            My past life has been chaste and temperate; <lb/>
            and I was never exposed, till now, to the <lb/>
            darts of slander. Besides, had I been of a <lb/>
            lafcivious and abandoned difpofition, your <lb/>
            entrusting me with the government of so <lb/>
            many cities, mull have reformed me. What <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> D </note> <lb/>
            man <lb/>
             <pb n="34"/>
            man could be fo void of fenfe, as to lose so <lb/>
            many precious advantages, merely for the sake­ <lb/>
            of indulging in one pleafure, and that of the <lb/>
            brutal kind ? Had I been conscious to my felf <lb/>
            of the leaft guilt, I might have lawfully ob­ <lb/>
            jected to the concerning my felf with this <lb/>
            trial. For Dionysius does not charge me <lb/>
            with endeavouring to feduce a woman whom <lb/>
            he bad lawfully married ; but one who had <lb/>
            been exposed to fate, and purchased by him. <lb/>
            Now slaves are not comprehended in the laws <lb/>
            relating to adultery. Let him first read to <lb/>
            thee the instrument of manumission, and <lb/>
            speak of the marriage afterwards. And dareft <lb/>
            thou to call this woman thy wife whom thou <lb/>
            didst buy for a talent, of Theron the pyrate, <lb/>
            after he had stole her from the sepulchre ? <lb/>
            But thou wilt fay thus: She was free <lb/>
            when I bought her. In that cafe thou <lb/>
            wouldest be a woman-stealer, rather than a <lb/>
            husband. <lb/>
             <pb n="35"/>
            hufband. Nevertheless, I will now prove <lb/>
            my innocence, as though thou wert really <lb/>
            one. Suppofe, for a moment, that the pur­ <lb/>
            chafe was as the marriage, and the price, (a <lb/>
            talent) as the dower; and let her, though <lb/>
            born in Syracufe, be confidered as a Mile­ <lb/>
            fian :I yet would have thee (my Liege!) to <lb/>
            know, that I have not injured Dionyfius, ei­ <lb/>
            ther as a husband or as a mafter. In the hirA <lb/>
            place, he accuses me of an adulterous act not <lb/>
            yet committed, but intended: and not being <lb/>
            able to prove the fact, he produces a vain <lb/>
            letter that proves nothing. Now the laws <lb/>
            punifh facts. ShouldeR: thou bring forth <lb/>
            the letter; I then could juftly affirm that it <lb/>
            did not come from me. Thou haft not my <lb/>
            hand-writing. Chæreas is in Search of Cal­ <lb/>
            lirrhoe. Charge him with adultery. Yes, <lb/>
            (fayeft thou) but Chæreas is dead ; and thou <lb/>
            wouldeft feduce my wife under his name.--- <note type="footnote"> D 2 </note> <lb/>
            O <lb/>
             <pb n="36"/>
            O Dionyfius : Thou haft made me a chal­ <lb/>
            lenge, which will no ways turn to thy advan­ <lb/>
            tage. I conjure thee, as thy friend and thy <lb/>
            gueft, to withdraw the charge. Befeech the <lb/>
            king to ftop all proceedings. Recant all thy <lb/>
            injurious expreffions; and fay thus: Mi­ <lb/>
            thridates is innocent, and I accused him with­ <lb/>
            out foundation. But fhouldeft thou perfift <lb/>
            in thy obftinacy, thou wilt repent it, and <lb/>
            pronounce fentence againft thyfelf. I foretell <lb/>
            thee, thou wilt lore Callirrhoe, and the <lb/>
            king will find thee, and not me, to be the <lb/>
            adulterer. Here Mithridates ftopt : when <lb/>
            the eyes of the whole affembly were turned <lb/>
            to Dionyfius ; they being anxious to know, <lb/>
            whether, as it was left to his option, he <lb/>
            would withdraw the accusation, or firongly <lb/>
            perM in it: for they were ftrangers to what <lb/>
            Mithridates had hinted at obfcurely ; but <lb/>
            imagined that Dionyfius underwood his mean­ <lb/>
            ing <lb/>
             <pb n="37"/>
            ing perfectly. Now the latter, who did not <lb/>
            know, nor could in the leaft fufpect, that <lb/>
            Chæreas was ftill living, cried thus:Say <lb/>
            what thou wilt; Thou fhalt not impofe upon <lb/>
            me, either by fophiftry or by fpecious threats ; <lb/>
            nor fhall it ever be proved, that Dionyfius <lb/>
            is a falfe accufer. Here Mithridates, raif­ <lb/>
            ing his voice, like as when the prieft, full of <lb/>
            the God, is going to offer up facrifice, uttered <lb/>
            there words : Ye regal, celeftial and in­ <lb/>
            fernal Deities! 0 ! fuccour a virtuous man, <lb/>
            who, with pure hands, has frequently ad­ <lb/>
            dreffed his vows to you; and offered up the <lb/>
            moft fplendid facrifices in your honour : Do <lb/>
            ye, as a reward for my piety, wipe off each <lb/>
            provoking, each flanderous afperfion. O ! <lb/>
            lend me Chæreas, at leaft for this trial. Ap­ <lb/>

            calls thee. Stand, ftand between Dionyfius <note type="footnote"> D 3 </note> <lb/>

            and me; abd tell the king, which of us two <lb/>
            is the adulterer!</p>
          <p>VIII. Mithridates had Scarce ended, when, <lb/>
            as had been concerted, Chæreas himself came <lb/>
            forth. Callirrhoe, at the fight of him, cried <lb/>
            out: And daft thou live, my Chæreas ?— <lb/>
            the was flying to him, when Dionyfius, rufh­ <lb/>
            ing in between, prevented their mutual em­ <lb/>
            braces: Now who could represent, in due <lb/>
            colours, the face of this affembly ? What <lb/>
            poet ever brought, upon the ftage, fo un­ <lb/>
            common, fo marvellous an incident? Thofe <lb/>
            present might imagine they beheld a theatre, <lb/>
            where a thoufand oppofite paffions, all the <lb/>
            impulfes of the foul, were viable ; fuch as joy, <lb/>
            grief, aftonifhment, pity, diftruft and defire. <lb/>
            They proclaimed Chæreas bleft; they con­ <lb/>
            gratulated Mithridates; they pitied Dionyfius; <lb/>
            but, <lb/>
             <pb n="39"/>
            but, with regard to Callirrhoe, they were <lb/>
            in doubt what to fay, or how to aft; be­ <lb/>
            caufe fhe, being all amazement and ftruck <lb/>
            dumb, fixed her ardent eyes on Chaereas <lb/>
            only. It is my opinion, that the king himfelf <lb/>
            would gladly have been Chæreas. Rivals are <lb/>
            ever ready to wrangle with one another ; and <lb/>
            the pretence of the inchanting prize heigh. <lb/>
            tened the interesting contention ; infomuch <lb/>
            that they would certainly have fought, had <lb/>
            not the reverence, for their fovereign, re­ <lb/>
            ftrained them. However, their quarrel went <lb/>
            no farther than words; when the following <lb/>
            dialogue enfued *: I am the firft huf­ <note type="footnote"> * Chæreas and Dionyfius are imagined to fpeak <lb/>

            never drove away my wife ; whereas thou <lb/>
            didft bury her. Shew me the inftrument <lb/>
            of divorce.——Seeft thou the Sepulchre ?— <lb/>
            Callirrhoe's father difpofed of her, to me, in <lb/>
            marriage.- But the gave herself to me.— <lb/>
            Thou art unworthy the daughter of Hermo­ <lb/>
            crates. ——Thou art Hill more fo, thou <lb/>
            fhackled Have of Mithridates! I am come <lb/>
            to demand Callirrhoe.—But I poffefs her.- <lb/>
            Thou withholdeft another man's wife.— <lb/>
            Thou didft kill thine, Thou adulterer !— <lb/>
            Thou murtherer!——Thus did they con­ <lb/>
            tend with, and reproach each other. In the <lb/>
            mean time Callirrhoe, with downcaft eyes, <lb/>
            fhed a flood of tears ; fhe loving Chæreas to <lb/>

            nyfius. <lb/>
             <pb n="41"/>
            nyfius. The king then having commanded <lb/>
            the contending parties to withdraw, he be­ <lb/>
            gan to deliberate with his friends, not on <lb/>
            Mithridates, who had made fo noble a de­ <lb/>
            fence ; but whether it would become him, <lb/>
            to pronounce definitively, which of the two <lb/>
            hufbands had a right to Callirrhoe. Some <lb/>
            were of opinion, that it would be beneath <lb/>
            the king to take cognizance of fuch a fuit.— <lb/>
            Thou haft heard very juftly (faid they) the <lb/>
            charge brought by Mithridates, he being a <lb/>
            governor; but the other two are private per­ <lb/>
            tons. ——Neverthelefs moft thought diffe­ <lb/>
            rently, both on account of Callirrhoe's fa­ <lb/>

            of fome fervice to the royal family: and be­ <lb/>
            caufe the king would not, on this occasion, <lb/>
            judge a new caufe ; but one, part of which <lb/>
            he <lb/>

            he bad already heard. However, none of <lb/>
            them cared to discover the true motive of the <lb/>
            advice they gave, which was, that they could <lb/>
            not bear to be deprived of the fight of Cal- <lb/>
            Jirrhoe. The king having font for thofe <lb/>
            whom he, a little before, had commanded to <lb/>
            leave the court, fpake thus: I now ac­ <lb/>
            quit Mithridatcs, who may fet out for his go­ <lb/>
            vernment to-morrow, after having received <lb/>
            the ufual prefents. As to Chæreas and Dio­ <lb/>
            nyfius, they may lay, before me, their re­ <lb/>
            fpective claims to the woman; for I ought to <lb/>
            protect the daughter of that Hermocrates <lb/>
            who, in a naval engagement, vanquifhed the <lb/>
            Athenians, the moft hateful, the moft trou­ <lb/>
            blefome enemies to me and to Perfia. <lb/>
            Artaxerxes having pronounced this fentence, <lb/>
            Mithridates paid his adoration; but the other <lb/>
            parties <lb/>
             <pb n="43"/>
            parties were greatly furprized and exafperat­ <lb/>
            ed, and knew not what to do; which the <lb/>
            king perceiving,—I fhall not (faid he) haften <lb/>
            ye ; but on the contrary, will allow ye five <lb/>
            days to prepare for the trial; and, when ye <lb/>
            are ready, return hither. In the mean time <lb/>
            Statira, my contort, fhall take care of Cal­ <lb/>
            lirrhoe : it not being juft that a woman, the <lb/>
            poffeffion of whom is contefted by two huf- . <lb/>
            bands, fhould be brought into court by either <lb/>
            of them. The aflembly then broke up, <lb/>
            with forrow and diffatisfaction in their coun­ <lb/>
            tenances, Mithridates excepted, who was all <lb/>
            joy; and who, after receiving the royal <lb/>
            gifts, flayed that night in Babylon, and next <lb/>
            morning fet out for Caria, with greater Splen­ <lb/>
            dor than before.</p>

          <p>IX. The eunuchs to whom Callirrhoe was <lb/>
            delivered, conduced her to the queen, with­ <lb/>
            out firft informing her of their coming ; the <lb/>
            king never fending previous notice, on any <lb/>
            occafion whatfover. Statira, at the fudden <lb/>
            appearance of Callirrhoe, Parted from her <lb/>
            bed ; imagining that fhe faw Venus; a god­ <lb/>
            defs to whom fhe paid peculiar worship. <lb/>
            Immediately Callirrhoe proftrated herfelf be­ <lb/>
            fore the queen, whofe error and furprize being <lb/>
            perceived by the eunuch :This (faid he) <lb/>
            is Callirrhoe. The king has rent her hither, <lb/>
            in order that fhe may be under thine eye, <lb/>
            till the day of trial.—Statira heard this with <lb/>
            pleafure; when fuppreffing all female envy, <lb/>
            fhe fhewed greater kindnefs to Callirrhoe, on <lb/>
            account of the honour which Artaxerxes had <lb/>
            done her, in giving fo exquisite a beauty to <lb/>
            her <lb/>
             <pb n="45"/>
            her in charge. The queen indeed was <lb/>
            charmed with Callirrhoe, when taking her by <lb/>
            the hand :My dear woman (faid fhe) be <lb/>
            comforted, and dry thy tears : Artaxerxes is <lb/>
            the moft benevolent, the moft gracious of <lb/>
            princes. Thou fhalt poffefs that hufband <lb/>
            who is nearer to thy heart; and, when the <lb/>
            trial is over, thy nuptials fhall be folemnizcd <lb/>
            with greater magnificence than before. Go <lb/>
            now and reft thyfelf; as I perceive that thou <lb/>
            art much fatigued, and thy mind vaftly un­ <lb/>
            eafy.—— Callirrhoe was glad to hear there <lb/>
            words, fhe wifhing much for repofe. When <lb/>
            fhe was put to bed, and every one retired, <lb/>
            laying her hands on her eyes:And have <lb/>
            ye really, (faid fhe,) beheld Chæreas ? Was <lb/>
            it my own Chæreas ? or was it an illufion ? <lb/>
            Perhaps Mithridates, in order to favour his <note type="footnote"> 7 </note> <lb/>
            Cult, <lb/>
             <pb n="46"/>
            fuit, called up this phantom at the trial; <lb/>
            for it is faid, that there are magicians in <lb/>
            Perfia. But then it fpake. It related every <lb/>
            particular, as though it. had been an intelli­ <lb/>
            gent Being. Yet how could he refrain from <lb/>
            embracing me? We even Separated without <lb/>
            a kits. While Callirrhoe was ruminating <lb/>
            on thefe things, fhe heard the found of feet, <lb/>
            and female voices; for all the women flocked <lb/>
            to the queen ; imagining that they might be <lb/>
            indulged the full liberty of gazing on Callir­ <lb/>
            rhoe. But Statira faid : —We mull: not <lb/>
            difturb her: the is not well: there will be <lb/>
            days enough for us to fee, to hear, and to <lb/>
            converfe with her. Yet all went away <lb/>
            greatly diffatisfied, but returned on the mor­ <lb/>
            row ; and crouded, in this manner, daily; <lb/>
            fo that the palace was much more frequented <lb/>
            than <lb/>
             <pb n="47"/>
            than before. The king himfelf came oftner <lb/>
            to the apartments of the women, upon pre­ <lb/>
            tence of vifiting Statira. Many rich gifts <lb/>
            were fent to Callirrhoe, but the conftantly <lb/>
            refufed them all ; fhe ftill appearing in the­ <lb/>
            garb of an unfortunate woman; being clad <lb/>
            in mourning; unadorned; and fitting on the <lb/>
            ground j notwithstanding which fhe appeared <lb/>
            Rill more beautiful. Being afked by the <lb/>
            king, which of her hufbands the would pre­ <lb/>
            fer; fhe made no anfwer, but burft into tears. <lb/>
            Such was Callirrhoe's fituation, while Diony­ <lb/>
            fius ftrove to bear his misfortunes like a man ; <lb/>
            he being endued with uncommon fortitude <lb/>
            of foul, and devoting himself to the fludy <lb/>
            of moral philofophy. But fo great, fo un­ <lb/>
            ufual, fo unexpected a woe, as that he la­ <lb/>
            boured under, might eafily have overpowered <note type="footnote"> * </note> <lb/>
            the <lb/>
             <pb n="48"/>
            the ftrongeft brain. His love was far more <lb/>
            violent, than when he lived in Miletus; as, <lb/>
            in the infancy of his paffion, beauty only had <lb/>
            attraaed him; but now he was inflamed <lb/>
            ftill more from many other causes; fuch as <lb/>
            familiarity and cohabitation with Callirrhoe : <lb/>
            Affection for the fond pledge fhe had brought <lb/>
            him; his fear left the fhould prove ungrate­ <lb/>
            ful, and forfake him for another: Jealoufy ; <lb/>
            and, above all, the extraordinary circum­ <lb/>
            dances with which this incident was attended.</p>
          <p>X. Dionyfius would often cry out on a fud­ <lb/>
            den: Who is this Protefilaus returned <lb/>
            again, at this time, to life ? What infernal <lb/>
            Deity can I have offended, that I thus find <lb/>
            a rival in one deceased, whofe fepulchre ftands <lb/>
            On my land ? Thou (0 Venus!) haft laid <lb/>
            fnares <lb/>
             <pb n="49"/>
            fdares for me, though I confecrated thee <lb/>
            In various parts of my eftate, and offered <lb/>
            up a multitude of Sacrifices in thine honour. <lb/>
            Wherefore didft thou fhew me Callirrhoe, <lb/>
            If our union. was not to be lafting ? Why <lb/>
            make him a father, who is not a hufband ?— <lb/>
            Then damping his fon, and fhedding a flood <lb/>
            of tears:— Ah! haplefs infant, (cried he,) <lb/>
            thy birth teemed aufpicious, but thou <lb/>
            now art a burthen to me; a fad inheri­ <lb/>
            tance left me by thy mother; a monument <lb/>
            of an ill-fated paffion. Thou, though a <lb/>
            child, yet art not altogether infenfible of thy <lb/>
            father's fufferings. We fet but, with an <lb/>
            evil omen, on our journey; and Should <lb/>
            not have left Miletus. Babylon has been <note type="footnote"> VOL. It. </note> <note type="footnote"> E </note> <lb/>
            our <lb/>
             <pb n="50"/>
            our ruin. I loft my caufe in the firft hear­ <lb/>
            ing, when Mithridates was my accuser ; and <lb/>
            my chief fear arifes from the fecond, for <lb/>
            there furely is not lefs danger in it; and I <lb/>
            entertain no hopes from the beginning of the <lb/>
            trial, My wife has been torne from me, <lb/>
            though I am yet un-fentenced ; and I now <lb/>
            contend, in great peril, with another man, <lb/>
            for the poffeffion of her ; and, what is ftill <lb/>
            more aggravating, I know not on which of <lb/>
            the two her choice may fall. But thou <lb/>
            (my darling child!) mayeft earn it from her, <lb/>
            as fhe is thy mother. Go then, and fuppli­ <lb/>
            cate her for thy father. Weep; kifs her; <lb/>
            and fay: Deareft mother! My father loves <lb/>
            thee. But take care that thou employ not <lb/>
            any <lb/>
             <pb n="51"/>
            any injurious or reproachful expreffions. <lb/>
            But (Pedagogue !) why do I talk thus wild­ <lb/>
            ly ? No one will permit us to enter the pa­ <lb/>
            lace. 0 barbarous tyranny! to fhut out a <lb/>
            fon who carries, from his father, a moft <lb/>
            tender meffage to his other parent. In <lb/>
            this manner did Dionyfius pafs his time, till <lb/>
            the day of trial; he acting as judge in this <lb/>
            center between love and reafon ; and re­ <lb/>
            folving to beftow the palm on the victor. <lb/>
            On the other hand, Choreas, oppreffed with <lb/>
            grief, was quite inconfolable: when feigning <lb/>
            himfelf lick, he ordered Polycharmus to <lb/>
            accompany Mithridates, their common be­ <lb/>
            nefactor, who was fetting out. Being now <lb/>
            left alone, he fixed a halter, when fpringing <lb/>
            forward, in order to perpetrate a horrid <note type="footnote"> E 2 </note> <lb/>
            deed, <lb/>
             <pb n="52"/>
            deed, he fpake thus: I Should have quit­ <lb/>
            ted life with lefs reluctance in Caria, when <lb/>
            being a Cave, I was there faftened to the <lb/>
            Crofs, on a falfe accusation: for then I <lb/>
            should have died in the fweet delufion that <lb/>
            Callirrhoe still loved me; whereas I now <lb/>
            ball not only lore my life, but alfo the con­ <lb/>
            folation I muft otherwife have found in death. <lb/>
            Callirrhoe faw me, and yet did not come <lb/>
            forward. She did not kits me; but shew­ <lb/>
            ed, in my pretence, a regard for another <lb/>
            man. However, she shall behave so no more, <lb/>
            I will anticipate the fentence, and not wait <lb/>
            for an inglorious end. Poor and inconfider­ <lb/>
            able as I am; a foreigner, and quite un­ <lb/>
            known, I muft necessarily be an unequal com­ <lb/>
            petitor with, Dionyfius. Yet mayest thou <lb/>
            live <lb/>
             <pb n="53"/>
            live happy (O my wife!) for wife I still call <lb/>
            thee, though thou lovest another man. I <lb/>
            shall now depart, for ever! and not inter­ <lb/>
            rupt thy conjugal felicity. May riches fur­ <lb/>
            round thee! Mayeft thou luxuriate in de­ <lb/>
            lights ! and long, long enjoy the splendors <lb/>
            of Ionia. Possess then the hufband who <lb/>
            is dear to thee. The last boon, which the <lb/>
            dying Chæreas has to request is, that thou, <lb/>
            when I shall be no more, mayeft approach <lb/>
            my corps ; and shed, if possible, a tear <lb/>
            over it. I shall prize this more than Im­ <lb/>
            mortality. Reclining on the pillar of my <lb/>
            sepulchre, pronounce, at least, the follow­ <lb/>
            ing words; even though thy hufband, even <lb/>
            though thy infant, should fee thee:- <lb/>
            Thou now, (O Chæreas!) art really gone; <lb/>
            thou now art dead. Hadft thou lived, and <note type="footnote"> E 3 </note> <lb/>

            made choice of thee for my hufband. I <lb/>
            shall hear thy voice (O wife!) and, per­ <lb/>
            haps, believe thee; and, by thy means, I <lb/>
            may acquire authority, and appear glorious <lb/>
            in the eyes of the infernal Deities :</p>

            AS the king was to pronounce the <lb/>
            day following, whether Chæreas or <lb/>
            Dionyfius should be the hufband of Callir­ <lb/>
            rhoe, all Babylon was in tuppence; every one <lb/>
            faying, both at home and in the streets <lb/>
            To- <lb/>
             <pb n="58"/>
            To morrow will be the nuptials of Callir­ <lb/>
            rhoe. Which of the two will, at laft, be. <lb/>
            the fortunate man ?Now the city was di­ <lb/>
            vided into two parties. Thofe who favour­ <lb/>
            ed Chæreas, faid :He is the firft huf­ <lb/>
            band : he married Callirrhoe, when a virgin; <lb/>
            loving her, and being beloved. He received <lb/>
            Callirrhoe from her father. She was buried <lb/>
            by her country. He did not forsake his <lb/>
            wife, nor she abandon him. Dionysius nei­ <lb/>
            ther bought nor efpoufed Callirrhoe. Rob­ <lb/>
            bers fold her; but it is not lawful to pur­ <lb/>
            chafe a free-born woman. On the other <lb/>
            hand, the advocates for Dionysius fpake <lb/>
            thus: He rescued Callirrhoe from py­ <lb/>
            rates, when expofed to their murthering dag­ <lb/>
            gers ; and gave a talent for her redemption. <lb/>
            He firft faved, and then took her to his bed. <lb/>
            Chæ- <lb/>
             <pb n="59"/>
            Chæreas, after marrying Callirrhoe, killed <lb/>
            her. She cannot have forgot her nuptials. <lb/>
            One ftrong argument that is apparent to all <lb/>
            men, and which must Secure the victory to <lb/>
            Dionyfius, is, her having borne him a son, <lb/>
            who is Hill living. Thus reafoned, among, <lb/>
            themfelves, the men. As to the women, they <lb/>
            not only addressed Callirrhoe with the most <lb/>
            animating exhortations; but albo gave her <lb/>
            advice, as though the had been present. <lb/>
            Do not quit (faid they) the hufband who <lb/>
            efpoufed thee, when a virgin. Take thy <lb/>
            first lover, thy fellow citizen. Thus mayest <lb/>
            thou again behold thy father: otherwise thou <lb/>
            wilt live, as an exile, in a foreign land. <lb/>
            Others faid: Prefer thy deliverer ; he <lb/>
            who faved, and did not assassinate thee. Should <lb/>
            Chæreas be fired anew with rage, thou then <lb/>

            Do not betray thy fon, but honour his fa­ <lb/>
            ther, Such, was the general difcourfe, <lb/>
            throughout Babylon, which appeared as one <lb/>
            court of Judicature. It was now the night <lb/>
            which preceded the day of trial, when the <lb/>
            king and queen revolved, as they lay in bed, <lb/>
            reflexions of a very different nature. The <lb/>
            queen wished earnestly for morning, in order <lb/>
            to get rid of Callirrhoe, who was now a <lb/>
            kind of burthen to her; as the exquisite <lb/>
            beauty of this Greek, gave rife to compari­ <lb/>
            sons no ways advantageous to the queen, <lb/>
            when both were feen together. Farther: <lb/>
            The frequent visits paid by the king, and <lb/>
            his great courtesy at unufual hours, raided the <lb/>
            queers fufpicion; as he, till then, had been <lb/>
            rarely feen in the apartment of the women: <lb/>
            but <lb/>
             <pb n="61"/>
            but evet fince Callirrhoe's residence in the <lb/>
            palace, he was running to them perpetually. <lb/>
            She alfo obferved, that while the king was <lb/>
            conversing familiarly with Callirrhoe, he <lb/>
            would frequently ogle her; and dart fecret <lb/>
            glances, which were directed to her from an <lb/>
            involuntary impulse. For thefe reafons, Sta­ <lb/>
            lira was overjoyed at the near approach of <lb/>
            the day of trial: while far different thoughts <lb/>
            employed the king; he not fleeping a wink <lb/>
            all that night, but</p>

          </ab>
          <p>Perplexed with a variety of thoughts, he was <lb/>
            continually laying to himself: The day <lb/>
            of trial is near; and I was too precipitate <lb/>
            in not fixing it later. What mull be done <lb/>
            tomorrow morning ? Callirrhoe will certain- <note type="footnote"> 6 </note> <lb/>
            ly <lb/>
             <pb n="62"/>
            ly return; either to Miletus or to Syracuse. <lb/>
            There now remains a very short fpace of <lb/>
            time; a span, for me to feast on an inchant­ <lb/>
            ing object; after which, my Servant will be <lb/>
            happier than I. Confider, (0 my foul!) <lb/>
            what is to be done. Be ever prefent and <lb/>
            prepared. No one fpreads fnares against <lb/>
            thee but thy felf. Cupid is now the beguiler <lb/>
            of love. Firft then anfwer thefe questions <lb/>
            to thine own heart: Who art thou ? <lb/>
            The lover of Callirrhoe, or her judge ? But <lb/>
            impofe not on thy felf. Thou art deeply <lb/>
            smitten, though thou knoweft it not. -Of this <lb/>
            thou wilt be fooner convinced, by not em­ <lb/>
            ploying force againft her. Why then thus <lb/>
            torment thyfelf ? Phoebus, from whom thou <lb/>
            art descended, chofe and allotted, for thee, <lb/>
            a creature the most lovely, the moft perfect, <lb/>
            his <lb/>
             <pb n="63"/>
            his eye ever beheld: and yet thou doft reject <lb/>
            the gift of this God. Thou art anxious for <lb/>
            thy mean slaves, Chæreas and Dionyfius; <lb/>
            at a Time that thou art to decide, which of <lb/>
            them fhall conquer in this trial, and be the <lb/>
            huiband of Callirrhoe. I, the mighty king, <lb/>
            am acting the part of an antiquated Pander. <lb/>
            But then I have undertaken to judge this <lb/>
            caufe, and the whole world, knows it. But <lb/>
            my greater uneafinefs, on this occasion, <lb/>
            arifes from Statira. Do thou therefore nei­ <lb/>
            ther divulge thy passion, nor put an end to, <lb/>
            the trial. It will be enough for thee to gaze <lb/>
            upon Callirrhoe. Postpone therefore the de­ <lb/>
            cision, fince a Plebeian judge might do this.</p>
          <p>II. As foon as it was day-light, the offi­ <lb/>
            cers prepared the royal hall, when vast mul- <note type="footnote"> I </note> <lb/>
            titudes <lb/>
             <pb n="64"/>
            titudes flocked to the palace. All Babylon <lb/>
            was in motion ; and, as in the Olympic games, <lb/>
            the champions went to the field of exercife, <lb/>
            followed, by a long train; our two rivals <lb/>
            were cfcorted in like manner. Dionysius was <lb/>
            accompanied by Persians of rank; while Chæ­ <lb/>
            reas was attended by the populace. Ten thou­ <lb/>
            fand voices and joyful acclamations were heard, <lb/>
            of thole who favoured the respective parties, <lb/>
            and wished them fuccefs; crying: -Justice <lb/>
            is on thy fide. It is thou wilt conquer.- <lb/>
            The prize, on this fignal occafion, was not <lb/>
            an olive leaf, nor apples, nor the branch of <lb/>
            a pine-tree ; but the firft beauty in the world, <lb/>
            for whom the gods themselves might justly <lb/>
            have contended. Now the king, having call­ <lb/>
            ed for-the eunuch Artaxates his chief favou­ <lb/>
            rite, fpake thus to him: - The celestial <lb/>
            Deities <lb/>
             <pb n="65"/>
            Deities having appeared to me on a sudden, <lb/>
            in a dream, and required victims ; I there­ <lb/>
            fore muft acquit myself of the duty which <lb/>
            piety, towards them, demands. Be then aH <lb/>
            Alia enjoined to celebrate a folemn festival, <lb/>
            during thirty days; and let every kind of <lb/>
            bufinefs, all law proceedings, be fufpended <lb/>
            during that time. Artaxates published the <lb/>
            royal ordinance ; when immediately the city <lb/>
            was crouded with multitudes, crowned with <lb/>
            chaplets, and offering up sacrifices. Nought <lb/>
            was heard but the warbling of flutes, and <lb/>
            the found of rural pipes, intermixed with <lb/>
            voices. Incenfe was burnt in the courts be­ <lb/>
            fore each houfe, and banquets were feen in <lb/>
            every ftreet.</p>

            The king prefented fplendid victims at the <lb/>
            altar. He then facrificed, for the firft time, <lb/>
            to the God of Love, among other Deities; . <lb/>
            and frequently addressed Venus, beseeching <lb/>
            that goddefs to interceed powerfully, with <lb/>
            her fon, in his favour. Amid this general <lb/>
            joy, three persons only were in the deeper <lb/>
            affliction; Callirrhoe, Dionyfius ; and, more <lb/>
            than either, Chæreas. Callirrhoe could not <lb/>
            show her grief, as The was in the palace; <lb/>
            but then the groaned bitterly in fecret, and <lb/>
            vented dreadful imprecations againft the fefti­ <lb/>
            val. But Dionysius called for curves upon <lb/>
            himseif, for his having left Miletus:—Wretch <lb/>
            that thou art, (cried he) fubmit patiently to <lb/>
            evils which thou haft brought upon thyself! <lb/>
            Thou mighteft have possessed Callirrhoe, even <lb/>
            though Chæreas had been living: Thou <lb/>
            waft <lb/>
             <pb n="67"/>
            wast the master in Miletus; and not a letter <lb/>
            could have been delivered, to Callirrhoe, with­ <lb/>
            out thy content. Who could have feen ; who <lb/>
            could have come near her ? Thou now haft <lb/>
            thrown thyfelf, spontaneously, into the midft <lb/>
            of thine enemies; and would it were thy <lb/>
            felf only, and not the object who is dearer to <lb/>
            thee than thy foul! Hence art thou furiously <lb/>
            attacked on every fide. What fayeft thou <lb/>
            (Madman!) Chæreas is thy adversary, and <lb/>
            thy fovereign is become thy rival. The king <lb/>
            now fees visions; and the gods demand of <lb/>
            him those victims which he sacrifices to them <lb/>
            daily. Shameful conduct! for a man, who <lb/>
            has the wife of another in his houfe, to pro­ <lb/>
            tract a trial, and yet fet up for a judge. <lb/>
            Thus did Dionyfius lament his wretched fate : <lb/>
            during which Chæreas, refufing the least <note type="footnote"> F 2 </note> <lb/>
            sustenance, <lb/>
             <pb n="68"/>
            sustenance, and being refolved to give up life ; <lb/>
            he thus addreffed his friend Polycharmus, <lb/>
            who would not permit him to die of hunger.- <lb/>
            Thou, under the femblance of a friend, art <lb/>
            my greater enemy ; because thou doft keep <lb/>
            me in torments, and art delighted with my <lb/>
            pains. Were thou my friend, thou would­ <lb/>
            eft not envy my attempt, to free myself <lb/>
            from the cruel tyranny under which, by <lb/>
            the malevolence of I know not what <lb/>
            Deity, I fo fhamefully groan. How often <lb/>
            might I have been blest, had it not been <lb/>
            for thee ? Thrice happy were my lot, had I <lb/>
            been buried in Syracufe with Callirrhoe ! But <lb/>
            when I wished earnestly to die, thou didft <lb/>
            withhold my hand; and thereby deprive me <lb/>
            of the sweetest companion to the shades be­ <lb/>
            low. Perhaps she would not have left the <lb/>
            fe­ <lb/>
             <pb n="69"/>
            sepulchre, nor have abandoned me, though <lb/>
            dead. And had she quitted me, I now should <lb/>
            be lying peaceably in the grave; and thereby <lb/>
            have avoided flavery ; the band of pyrates; <lb/>
            chains; and, what is still more grievous, to <lb/>
            me, than even crucifixion, the king. <lb/>
            Death would have been welcome to me, <lb/>
            for then I should not have heard of the <lb/>
            Second nuptials of Callirrhoe. And, since <lb/>
            the opening of the trial, Should I not <lb/>
            have left the world, hadst thou not pre­ <lb/>
            vented me ? I faw Callirrhoe, but could <lb/>
            not approach, nor kifs her. 0 unparelleled <lb/>
            and incredible incident! It is disputed in a <lb/>
            court of justice, whether Chæreas is, or is <lb/>
            not, the husband of Callirrhoe. But envious <lb/>
            fate will not permit this trial, whatever may <lb/>
            be the refult of it, ever to come to a period. <lb/>
            I am hated by the gods, both fleeping and <note type="footnote"> F 3 </note> <lb/>

            words, was going to rufh upon his sword, <lb/>
            when Polycharmus stopped his hand; and, <lb/>
            holding him fast, thereby prevented his de­ <lb/>
            ftroying himfelf.</p>
          <p>III. The king having font for his most <lb/>
            faithful eunuch, was at firft afhamed to fee <lb/>
            him : when Artaxates perceiving his confu­ <lb/>
            sion, and the difficulty with which he utter­ <lb/>
            ed his words, faid thus Why doll thou <lb/>
            (O my liege !) conceal any thing from thy <lb/>
            fervant, who wishes thee every felicity, and <lb/>
            can faithfully trcafure up a secret ? What <lb/>
            mighty evil can have befallen thee ? Much I <lb/>
            fear, that Shares are spread for thee :- <lb/>
            Very dangerous ones, (replied the Monarch) <lb/>
            are preparing ; yet not by a mortal, but by <note type="footnote"> 9 </note> <lb/>
            a <lb/>
             <pb n="71"/>
            a Deity. Who Cupid is, I had already learnt, <lb/>
            both from profe-writers, and from poets; <lb/>
            and that all the gods are fubject to his em­ <lb/>
            pire, and even Jupiter :-But then I doubted, <lb/>
            whether any of them was mightier than my­ <lb/>
            felf. But that God is now prefent ; and, <lb/>
            with the ftrongeft impetuofity, has taken <lb/>
            paffeffion of my whole heart. It is grievous <lb/>
            to confefs it; and yet I mufl be forced to <lb/>
            reveal the truth, which is, that I am the cap-. <lb/>
            tive of this god:—In uttering there words, <lb/>
            a violent flood of tears burft from him, <lb/>
            and flopped his tongue. And now Artaxates <lb/>
            discovered, by the king's fudden filence, who <lb/>
            it was that had wounded him ; for his tears <lb/>
            were not feigned, and the eunuch had before <lb/>
            obferved his riling paffion ; and indeed it was <lb/>
            obvious, and beyond all doubt, that Artax- <note type="footnote"> F 4 </note> <lb/>
            erxes, <lb/>
             <pb n="72"/>
            erxes, whenever Callirrhoe was prefent, <lb/>
            could not be enamoured of any other wo­ <lb/>
            man. Nevertheless the eunuch, pretending <lb/>
            ignorance on this occasion, faid: What <lb/>
            fair-one (O king !) how charming foever, can <lb/>
            have enflaved thee, whom all things beauti­ <lb/>
            ful obey? as gold, filver, rich veftments, <lb/>
            horres, cities, nations ; and many lovely wo­ <lb/>
            men; efpecially Statira, the moft charming <lb/>
            of her fex under the fun, and who is enjoy­ <lb/>
            ed by thee only. Thou indeed mayeft not <lb/>
            now covet her, as poffeffion is apt to take <lb/>
            away defire ; except that fome goddefs Should <lb/>
            be descended from the fkies, or another <lb/>
            Thetis rifen from the ocean : for it is my opi­ <lb/>
            nion that the Deities would wilh for thy con­ <lb/>
            verfe. — Perhaps (faid Artaxerxes) thou <lb/>
            haft now fpoke the truth, in fuppofing this <lb/>
            woman <lb/>
             <pb n="73"/>
            woman to be a divinity, for her beauty is <lb/>
            more than human. However, fhe will not <lb/>
            own this, but feigns herfelf a Greek of Syra­ <lb/>
            cufe. Now a circumftance which feems to <lb/>
            indicate deceit, is the precaution the has <lb/>
            taken, to prevent her being detected in a <lb/>
            falfity ; I mean her not mentioning a city <lb/>
            within our empire ; but fixing the fcene of her <lb/>
            ftory beyond Ionia, and crofs a wide-extended <lb/>
            ocean. She is come hither upon pretence <lb/>
            of a trial, but the whole is a fiction of her <lb/>
            own invention. I am amazed how thou canft <lb/>
            call Statira the moft beautiful among women, <lb/>
            when Callirrhoe is prefent. But I muft free <lb/>
            my felf from this anxiety. Do thou employ <lb/>
            all the powers of thy imagination ; and dif­ <lb/>
            cover, if poffible, a remedy for me.——My <lb/>
            Liege ! (replied Artaxates,) the remedy thou <lb/>
            feekeft <lb/>
             <pb n="74"/>
            feekeft is to be met with equally among the <lb/>
            Greeks and Barbarians. The only cure, for <lb/>
            thy paffion, is to poffefs the beloved object. <lb/>
            This doubtless is the meaning of the renown­ <lb/>
            ed oracle, viz. They who inflict a wound <lb/>
            can alfo heal it.-The king, afhamed at <lb/>
            what he heard, cried: Prefume not to <lb/>
            advife me to reduce another man's wife. I <lb/>
            well remember the laws which I myfelf fra­ <lb/>
            med, and the jufiice I cxercife on all occafions. <lb/>
            I cannot charge myfelf with intemperance of <lb/>
            any kind ; nor am I captivated to fo violent <lb/>
            a degree.Artaxates fearing that he had <lb/>
            fpoke too inadvertently, turned his difcourfe <lb/>
            to praife, by faying: ——My fovereign! ge­ <lb/>
            nerous, and worthy of thy felf is thy way of <lb/>
            thinking. Apply not that remedy to love, <lb/>
            which is employed by other men ; but a <lb/>
            more <lb/>
             <pb n="75"/>
            more efficacious, a princely remedy, I mean, <lb/>
            the combating thine own inclinations ; for <lb/>
            thou, Singly, mayefl vanquifh that Deity. <lb/>
            Devote thy felf to pleafures of every kind. <lb/>
            Hunting is thy favourite diverfion; I having <lb/>
            feen thee pafs whole days in that exercife (fo <lb/>
            great was thy fondness for it,) without eating <lb/>
            or drinking. It is better to purfue the chafe, <lb/>
            than to flay in the palace by the fire-fide.</p>
          <p>IV. This advice being approved, a royal chafe <lb/>
            was proclaimed. There then marched forth, <lb/>
            on horfeback, foldiers richly habited ; with <lb/>
            the chief nobles of Perfia, and the flower of <lb/>
            the army; the whole making a muft magnifi­ <lb/>
            cent fpectacle. But, above all alione the king, <lb/>
            he being mounted on a tall and moft beautiful <lb/>
            Nifean horfe ; whofe bridle, and the Several <lb/>
            trappings, <lb/>
             <pb n="76"/>
            trappings, were of gold. He was clad in a <lb/>
            robe of tyrian purple of Babylonifh work. <lb/>
            On his head was a yellow Tiara. A golden <lb/>
            fcymitar was girded on his thigh. He held <lb/>
            two darts in his hand. By his fide hung his <lb/>
            bow and quiver, the precious workmanship <lb/>
            of China. He fat his horfe with a fierce air. <lb/>
            Love is naturally fond of fplendor in drefs. <lb/>
            Artaxerxes was defirous of being beheld, in <lb/>
            the midft of his retinue, by Callirrhoe; and, <lb/>
            as he paffed through the city, he gazed on <lb/>
            every fide, to fee whether file did not furvey <lb/>
            the pompous proceffion from fome eminence. <lb/>
            Immediately the mountains echoed with the <lb/>
            fhouts of hunters; the barking of dogs ; the <lb/>
            neighing of hordes ; and the cries of rouzed <lb/>
            wild beafts. Such universal tumult might <lb/>
            have banifhed love from the breast of any <lb/>
            other <lb/>
            <pb n="77"/>
             <lb/>
            other man ; as this sport was very laborious; <lb/>
            joy being intermixed with fear, and pleafure <lb/>
            with danger. But as to the king, he did not <lb/>
            fec a fingle horfe, though fo many horfemen <lb/>
            ran before him: nor one wild beaU, though <lb/>
            fuch numbers were chafed: nor could he <lb/>
            hear the barking of dogs, though fuch mul­ <lb/>
            titudes were abroad; nor the cries of the <lb/>
            people, though fuch crouds were affembled. <lb/>
            He raw Callirrhoe only, though fhe was ab­ <lb/>
            rent, and heard no other voice, though the <lb/>
            fpake not. Cupid accompanied him in the <lb/>
            chafe: and as a Deity who is pleaded with <lb/>
            contention, feeing his adverfary armed againft <lb/>
            him, and in battle array; and acting very <lb/>
            wifely in his own conceit; the amorous god <lb/>
            turned the monarch's arts upon himfelf; and, <lb/>
            employing the fame remedies, thereby inflam­ <lb/>
             <lb/>
            3 <lb/>
            ed <lb/>
             <pb n="78"/>
            ed him the more: and having got poffef­ <lb/>
            lion of the inward recedes of the king's <lb/>
            heart, he whifpered it thus: How de­ <lb/>
            lightful would it be to fee Callirrhoe here, in <lb/>
            a fhort veft; her arms bare; with a ruddy <lb/>
            countenance : out of breath, and</p>

          </ab>
          <p>And thus imaging Callirrhoe to his mind, his <lb/>
            paffion increafed to a violent degree *. <lb/>
            ************ <lb/>
            Saying there words, Artaxates replied: <note type="footnote">* Many lines are wanting here, fuppofed to <lb/>
            be owing to the inadvertency of the Copift, <lb/>
            who, in the hurry of transcribing, omitted fame <lb/>
            periods. </note> <lb/>
            My <lb/>
             <pb n="79"/>
            My Liege! Thou haft forgot what is paft. <lb/>
            Callirrhoe has no hufband : and the law has <lb/>
            not yet determined to whom fhe fhall be de­ <lb/>
            livered : Reflect then that thou loveft a wi­ <lb/>
            dow. Fear not the laws, as there relate to <lb/>
            marriage ; nor be apprehensive of thy com­ <lb/>
            mitting adultery; fince, in that cafe, there <lb/>
            muft firft be a hufband who had been injured, <lb/>
            and then an adulterer who wronged him.— <lb/>
            There words were highly pleating to the mo­ <lb/>
            narch, they foothing his paffion ; when throw­ <lb/>
            ing his arms round the eunuch's neck, he <lb/>
            kiffed him, and faid: ——It is with juftice <lb/>
            that I efteem thee above all others, as thou <lb/>
            beared me the warmer affection, and art my <lb/>
            beft overfeer. Go therefore and bring Cal­ <lb/>
            lirrhoe to me, but in the manner I fhall corn­ <lb/>
            mand ; that is, privately, and without corn­ <lb/>
            pulfion ; <lb/>
             <pb n="80"/>
            pulfion ; for thou muft employ perfuafion and <lb/>
            artifice. Inftantly the king founded a re­ <lb/>
            treat, and departed full of joy, imagining <lb/>
            that he had made Callirrhoe his lovely prize. <lb/>
            Artaxates was not lets delighted, as thinking <lb/>
            he was going upon a noble commiffion : and. <lb/>
            that, for the future, he fhould govern the <lb/>
            court entirely ; not doubting but both the <lb/>
            king and Callirrhoe would be very willing to <lb/>
            promote him, in reward of this fervice. But <lb/>
            he relied chiefly on Callirrhoe. Artaxates <lb/>
            being a eunuch, a flave, and a Barbarian, <lb/>
            thought this an eafy tafk ; he not having any <lb/>
            idea of the generous fpirit of the Greeks ; ef­ <lb/>
            pecially of Callirrhoe's natural modefty, and <lb/>
            the extreme love the bore her hufband.</p>
          <p>V. The eunuch, watching a proper op­ <lb/>
            portunity, came to Callirrhoe, when taking <lb/>
            her <lb/>
             <pb n="81"/>
            her apart: — Woman, (faid he,) I offer thee <lb/>
            an invaluable treasure. Thou wilt not for­ <lb/>
            get the Signal Service I now do thee; I be­ <lb/>
            lieving thee to be of a grateful difpofition.— <lb/>
            Callirrhoe was in raptures at the opening of <lb/>
            this Speech; as we naturally expect what we <lb/>
            ardently wifh. Thus fhe did not doubt but <lb/>
            that Chæreas would be reftored to her in­ <lb/>
            ftantly. This fhe longed to hear; and there­ <lb/>
            fore promised to recom pence Artaxates, for <lb/>
            bringing fuch joyful news. Artaxates, after <lb/>
            much circumlocution, went on as follows.-... <lb/>
            Indulgent nature, (0 woman !) has bellowed <lb/>
            on thee divine beauty ; but this has not hi­ <lb/>
            therto been of any fignal, any mighty ad­ <lb/>
            vantage. That name, fo much renowned <lb/>
            throughout the world, has not yet found a <lb/>
            hufband or a lover worthy of it; on the <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> G </note> <lb/>
            con­ <lb/>
             <pb n="82"/>
            contrary, it fell to the lot of two men, the <lb/>
            one a pitiful Kinder, and the other a vaffal <lb/>
            of the king. Has any thing great or Splendid <lb/>
            accrued to thee by their means ? What fruit­ <lb/>
            ful lands, what rich, female ornaments have <lb/>
            they brought thee ? What cities doft thou <lb/>
            govern ? What Haves proftrate themselves at <lb/>
            thy feet ? The Babylonifh matrons keep fer­ <lb/>
            vants richer than thee. Yet art thou not to­ <lb/>
            tally neglected. Even the gods are mindful <lb/>
            of thee. For this they conducted thee hither, <lb/>
            upon pretence of the trial, in order that the <lb/>
            great king might behold thee: and the licit <lb/>
            joyful news I falute thee with, is, that he <lb/>
            fees thee with delight. I frequently call thee <lb/>
            to his remembrance, and am ever fpeaking <lb/>
            to him in thy praife.——Thefe laft words <lb/>
            Vere not true ; it being the cuftom for all <lb/>
            Haves, <lb/>
             <pb n="83"/>
            flaves, whenever they fpeak to their mafters <lb/>
            concerning any one, to commend themselves <lb/>
            at the fame time, imagining that this may <lb/>
            turn to their own advantage. Though there <lb/>
            words were as daggers to Callirrhoe's heart, <lb/>
            fhe yet pretended not to underhand them, <lb/>
            but faid: May the gods be ever propi­ <lb/>
            tious to the king, and the king to thee ; fince <lb/>
            thou art moved to companion for an unfortu­ <lb/>
            nate woman! I only implore Artaxerxes, to <lb/>
            free me as fOOD as poffible from my anxiety, <lb/>
            by fini(hing the trial ; that I may no longer <lb/>
            be an incumbrance to any one, and especially <lb/>
            to the queen. The eunuch thinking that <lb/>
            he had not fufficiently expreffed his meaning; <lb/>
            and that CalUrrhoe did not underhand him, <lb/>
            fpake more plainly, as follows: ——In one <lb/>
            circumftance thou, (0 woman!) art ex- <note type="footnote"> G a </note> <lb/>
            tremely <lb/>
             <pb n="84"/>
            tremely fortunate, which is, that neither <lb/>
            Haves nor mean persons are thy lovers; but <lb/>
            the great king, who can beftow on thee Mi­ <lb/>
            letus, and all Ionia ; together with Sicily, <lb/>
            and other more considerable nations. Sacri­ <lb/>
            fice then to the gods; pronounce thyfelf <lb/>
            bleft; do every thing in thy power, -to pleafe <lb/>
            the monarch more and more : and when thou <lb/>
            fhalt be wealthy, let not Artaxates be for­ <lb/>
            got.—— Callirrhoe would, at firft, have glad­ <lb/>
            ly tome out the reducer's eyes, had this been <lb/>
            poffible: but knowing mankind ; and being <lb/>
            able to, govern her temper ; recollecting im­ <lb/>
            mediately the place the was in ; who fhe her­ <lb/>
            felf was; and the person who fpake, her <lb/>
            rage foon changed into fcorn of this Barba­ <lb/>
            rian. 1 am not, (faid fhe) fo weak as to <lb/>
            fancy myfelf worthy of the great king; I <lb/>
            being <lb/>
             <pb n="85"/>
            being no ways fuperior to the naves of the <lb/>
            Perfian ladies : I therefore intreat thee, moft <lb/>
            earneftly, never to mention me again to thy <lb/>
            fovereign; for though he is not now difpleafed <lb/>
            with thee, he doubtlefs will afterwards be <lb/>
            exafperated, when he calls to mind, thy hav­ <lb/>
            ing fubjected, to the Have of Dionyfius, the <lb/>
            mafter of the world. I am furprized that <lb/>
            thou, being the wifeft of men, fhouldeft be <lb/>
            a ftranger to the king's humanity; he not <lb/>
            loving an unfortunate woman, but pitying <lb/>
            her. Let us then break off this difcourfe, <lb/>
            left fome one fhould calumniate us to the <lb/>
            queen. At thefe words the ran away <lb/>
            fwiftly, leaving the eunuch dumb and Spirit­ <lb/>
            lefs; for he, having been brought up under <lb/>

            pored that nothing was impoffible to the king, <lb/>
            nor even to himself.</p>
          <p>VI. Artaxates being now left alone, and <lb/>
            not thought worthy of an answer, went away, <lb/>
            tortured by a thousand different paffions. <lb/>
            He was angry at Callirrhoe; he was vexed <lb/>
            on his own account; and he dreaded his fo­ <lb/>
            vereign's difpleafure j concluding that Ar­ <lb/>
            taxerxes would not, perhaps, believe that he <lb/>
            had talked with Callirrhoe on this fubject, <lb/>
            though ineffectually; but, on the contrary, <lb/>
            muft certainly fuppofe, that he had betrayed <lb/>
            his truft, purely to oblige the queen. Laftly, <lb/>
            he was apprehenfive that Callirrhoe would <lb/>
            acquaint Static with their whole converfa­ <lb/>
            lion ; and that fhe, exasperated at this, would <lb/>
            me- <lb/>
             <pb n="87"/>
            meditate fome grievous vengeance againft him; <lb/>
            for his having been, not only the meffenger <lb/>
            in this amour, but albo the promoter of the <lb/>
            king's paffion. In the mean time the eunuch <lb/>
            revolved, in his own mind, how he might in­ <lb/>
            form the king of all that had paft, without <lb/>
            injuring himfelf. And now Callirrhoe, being <lb/>
            alone, reflected thus :Alas ! I prefaged <lb/>
            all that is come to pars. 0 Euphrates! Thou <lb/>
            art witness that I foretold I fhould never crofs <lb/>
            thy ftream again. Farewell father ! Fare­ <lb/>
            well mother! Farewell my native Syracufe ! <lb/>
            I never fhall behold ye more. Callirrhoe is <lb/>
            now really dead at laft. I efcaped indeed <lb/>
            from the fepulchre; but not even Theron the <lb/>
            pyrate could take me from hence. O infidi­ <lb/>
            ous Beauty! Thou art the caufe of all my <note type="footnote"> G 4 </note> <lb/>
            fuf­ <lb/>
             <pb n="88"/>
            fufferings. Through thee I was killed * ; <lb/>
            through thee was fold; through thee was <lb/>
            married to Dionyfius; through thee was <lb/>
            forced away to Babylon; and through thee <lb/>
            I appeared at the trial. To how many evils <lb/>
            haft thou expofed me? To robbers; to the <lb/>
            ocean ; to the fepulchre ; to flavery; to the <lb/>
            trial; and, far worfe than all thefe, to the <lb/>
            king's love. I will not here fpeak of his <lb/>
            anger, I dreading, fUll more, the queen's <lb/>
            jealousy: a paffion, which Chæreas himfelf, <lb/>
            though a Greek, could not conquer. What <lb/>
            then may not a woman, a barbarous miftrefs, <lb/>
            perpetrate? Come then (Callirrhoe!) refolve <lb/>
            on fome heroic act, worthy the daughter of <note type="footnote"> * We may fuppofe that diftraction (as has been <lb/>

            for that was merely a conference, and made <lb/>

            violence be ufed with regard to me; then <lb/>
            will be the time for me to prove my fidelity <lb/>
            to Chæreas, and that in his prefence —— <lb/>
            And now Artaxatcs going to the king, con­ <lb/>
            cealed from him all that had paft; alledging <lb/>
            bufinefs in excufe, and the ftrict eye which <lb/>
            the queen kept over Callirrhoe ; insomuch <lb/>
            that it was next to impoffible to get admit­ <lb/>
            tance to her. Thou, (faid he) my Liege ! <lb/>
            didft command me to keep this affair fecret; <lb/>
            and that with reafon and juftice, as thou haft <lb/>
            affumed the venerable character of a judge; <lb/>
            and doft ftudy to gain the affection of the <lb/>
            Perfians, for which the higheft applaufes are <lb/>
            bellowed on thee univerfally. The Greeks <lb/>
            wrangle <lb/>
             <pb n="90"/>
            wrangle for mere trifles, and are a loqua­ <lb/>
            cious people. Now fhouldeft thou make the <lb/>
            leaft attempt, they would immediately blazon <lb/>
            it to the world: Callirrhoe out of vanity, <lb/>
            for being beloved by a king; Dionyfius, and <lb/>
            Chæreas, out of jealoufy. Befides, it would <lb/>
            not be proper to difguft the queen, whore <lb/>
            beauty this trial has heightened. Thus, <lb/>
            out of deeming regard to his fovereign, he <lb/>
            threw many obftacles in his way; in order to <lb/>
            divert him, if poffible, from this paffion ; <lb/>
            and to free himfelf from fo very difficult a <lb/>
            commiffion.</p>
          <p>VII. The eunuch's perfuafion was effectual <lb/>
            at that junctare; but night being come, the <lb/>
            king found himfelf re-inflamed, when the <lb/>
            amorous god thus whimpered him: How <lb/>

            bewitching are Callirrhoe's eyes! How lovely <lb/>
            her lips ! -He then praifed her trefles, her <lb/>
            mien, her voice. Next, with what grace <lb/>
            fhe entered the court of juftice ! and with <lb/>
            what dignity fhe flood there ! how inchanting <lb/>
            her Speech ! How eloquent her filence ! Her <lb/>
            joy how fweet! Her tears how beautiful! <lb/>
            Thus did the king pafs almoft the whole <lb/>
            night without fleep ; except while he faw, <lb/>
            for a few moments, Callirrhoe in a dream. <lb/>
            And now, waking in the morning, he called <lb/>
            to him the eunuch, and faid :Go, and <lb/>
            be upon the watch the whole day, for thou <lb/>
            doubtlefs wilt find means to talk privately with <lb/>
            Callirrhoe, though but for a few minutes. <lb/>
            Was I inclined to fatiate my defires openly, <lb/>
            and to employ force, my Satellites would be <lb/>
            ready for that purpose. Artaxates having <lb/>
            paid <lb/>
             <pb n="92"/>
            paid his adoration, promifed to obey the royal <lb/>
            injunction ; no one being permitted to oppofe <lb/>
            the king's commands. However, knowing <lb/>
            that Callirrhoe would not give him an oppor­ <lb/>
            tunity of fpeaking to her ; but, on the con­ <lb/>
            trary, would always keep near the queen, <lb/>
            purpofely to prevent his talking with her: to <lb/>
            remedy this evil, Artaxates turned the fubject, <lb/>
            not to the woman who was watched, but to <lb/>
            her keeper.——If it pleafe thee, my Liege ! <lb/>
            (faid he) fend for Statira, as though thou <lb/>
            hadft fome fecret to communicate; by which <lb/>
            tneans her abfence will give me an opportu­ <lb/>
            nity of converging at leifure with Callirrhoe.— <lb/>
            Let this be done, (replied the king). <lb/>
            Artaxates then waiting on the queen, paid <lb/>
            his adoration, and faid :Princefs ! Thy <lb/>
            hufband requires thy prefence.- Statira prof­ <lb/>
            trated <lb/>
             <pb n="93"/>
            trated herfelf, on hearing the king's name; <lb/>
            and riling, flew to him. The eunuch, now <lb/>
            finding Callirrhoe apart from the queen, took <lb/>
            the former by the hand, as though he had <lb/>
            been a friend to the Greeks, and of a humane <lb/>
            difpofition; and drew her from among the <lb/>
            croud of waiting-women. Callirrhoe, though <lb/>
            fhe underwood his meaning; yet follow­ <lb/>
            ed him pale and fpeechlefs. They being <lb/>
            alone, he addreft her in thefe words: <lb/>
            Didft thou observe how the queen, the in­ <lb/>
            ftant the heard the name of Artaxerxes, fell <lb/>
            proftrate, and then ran to him ? Yet thou, <lb/>
            though a flave, canft not bear thine own fe­ <lb/>
            licity ; nor art fatisfied that he, who could <lb/>
            command thy pretence, is fo gracious; and <lb/>
            does thee fo fignal an honour, as to invite <lb/>
            and intreat thee. However, having a refpect <note type="footnote"> 2 </note> <lb/>
            for <lb/>
             <lb/>
             <pb n="94"/>
            for thee, I would not inform the king of thy <lb/>
            folly; but, on the contrary, have promifed <lb/>
            fomething in thy name. Two paths now lie <lb/>
            open before thee. Which of them wilt thou <lb/>
            ftrike into ? I will point out both. If tho.u <lb/>
            comply with the king's will, thou wilt re­ <lb/>
            ceive very precious gifts; and obtain the huf­ <lb/>
            band who is the object of thy wifhes ; for <lb/>
            Artaxerxes will not marry thee, but thou <lb/>
            wilt delight him for tome time. On the con­ <lb/>
            trary, fhouldeft thou disobey, hear what they <lb/>
            undergo who are enemies to the king ; fuch <lb/>
            only are not permitted to die, when they with <lb/>
            for death. Callirrhoe Smiling:This' <lb/>
            (faid fhe) is not the firft time I have fuffered <lb/>
            evils. I have been long acquainted with mi­ <lb/>
            fery. What punifhment could the king in. <lb/>
            flict, more grievous than that which now <lb/>

            tortures me ? I have been buried-alive; and <lb/>
            no prifon is fo contracted as the grave. I <lb/>

            deprived of the fight of my Chæreas. <lb/>
            There words betrayed her ; for the eunuch, <lb/>
            being fharp and fubtle, thereby found that <lb/>
            fhe entertained a paffion for fome one ; and <lb/>
            thereupon, faid Thou Purely mull: be <lb/>
            the moft foolifh of thy fex, to prefer the <lb/>
            flave of Mithridates to the king.—Callirrhoe, <lb/>
            exafperated to hear Chærcas mentioned thus <lb/>
            contemptuoufly, cried:Speak, (O man !) <lb/>
            more refpectfully : Chæreas is of noble birth, <lb/>
            and chief of that city which withftood the <lb/>
            arms of the Athenians, who yet overthrew <lb/>
            thy great king at Marathon and at Salamis.— <lb/>
            Having uttered there words, fhe burn into a <note type="footnote"> * </note> <lb/>
            flood <lb/>
             <pb n="96"/>
            flood of tears ; when Artaxates faid :—— <lb/>
            Thou art the caufe of the delay of this trial. <lb/>
            To obtain favour from thy judge, thou muft <lb/>
            yield to his defires, and thou thereby wilt <lb/>
            again poffefs the hufband who is dear to thee. <lb/>
            Chæreas may poffibly know nothing of this <lb/>
            affair; and, fhould he be informed of it, he <lb/>
            will not be jealous of one who is fo greatly <lb/>
            his fuperior; but, on the contrary, mutt <lb/>
            efteem thee ftill more for thy having pleafed <lb/>
            the king. The eunuch added thefe laft <lb/>
            words ; not to foothe Callirrhoe, but becaufe <lb/>
            they were his real fentiments : for all the Bar­ <lb/>
            barians behold their monarchs with awe and <lb/>
            aftonifhment ; and confider fuch as Deities <lb/>
            revealing themfelves to mortals. With regard <lb/>
            to Callirrhoe, fhe would not have accepted <lb/>
            of the nuptials of even Jove himfelf; nor <lb/>
            pre­ <lb/>

            preferred immortality to the paffing a fingle <lb/>
            day with Chæreas. Artaxates, finding he <lb/>
            could not work upon Callirrhoe : Wo­ <lb/>
            man ! (faid he) I will give thee leifure to de­ <lb/>
            liberate bn thefe things. In the mean time, <lb/>
            think ferioufly, not merely for thine own <lb/>
            fake, but alfo for that of Chæreas, who cer­ <lb/>
            tainly is in danger of fuffering a moft cruel <lb/>
            death; for the king will not bear to fee an­ <lb/>
            other preferred to himfelf in an affair of <lb/>
            love.——The eunuch then withdrew ; and <lb/>

            vice <lb/>
             <pb n="98"/>
            vice to Artaxerxes, that the Egyptians hav­ <lb/>
            ing raifed a mighty and moft formidable <lb/>
            army, were in open rebellion ; and after <lb/>
            murthering the governor fet over them by the <lb/>
            king, had elected a monarch from among <lb/>
            their countrymen ; who, having marched <lb/>
            through Pelufium, was making dreadful ha­ <lb/>
            vock in Syria and Phœnicia, which they <lb/>
            over-ran ; infomuch that the cities in general <lb/>
            were no more able to refift the fury of their <lb/>
            arms, than an impetuous flood or a raging <lb/>
            flame. At this news the king was <lb/>
            greatly alarmed. And the Perfians were <lb/>
            thunder-ftruck; all the Babylonians wore <lb/>
            forrowful countenances, and fear diftracted <lb/>
            their minds. Then the interpreters of dreams <lb/>
            and the foothfayers declared, that the king's <lb/>
            vifion had foretold what would come to <lb/>
            pafs t <lb/>
             <pb n="99"/>
            pafe : for as the gods, by demanding vic­ <lb/>
            tims, firewed that danger was at hand, it <lb/>
            denoted victory at the fame time. As ufual, <lb/>
            every thing was now faid, every thing done, <lb/>
            which a fudden, and unexpected war might <lb/>
            require; and all Alia was in confufion. <lb/>
            The king then fummoned the principal <lb/>
            Perfians; and as many governors of different <lb/>
            nations as were at court, whom he ufed to <lb/>
            confult on matters of high importance. The <lb/>
            council differed widely in opinion, when <lb/>
            debating on the present crifis. But it was <lb/>
            unanimoufly agreed, that expedition would <lb/>
            be neceffary ; and that not a fingle day, <lb/>
            ought to be loft, and this for two reasons: <lb/>
            Firft, to prevent the enemy from increafing ; <lb/>
            and fecondly, to animate their friends, by <note type="footnote"> H 2 </note> <lb/>
            fhewing <lb/>
             <pb n="100"/>
            fhewing them that fuccour was nigh. It was <lb/>
            added, that delay would produce the con­ <lb/>
            trary of this, fince their enemies would then <lb/>
            defpife them as cowards; and their friends <lb/>
            fubmit, finding themselves neglected. That <lb/>
            it was extremely fortunate for the king, that <lb/>
            this advice had been brought him, not in <lb/>
            Bactria nor in Ecbatana, but in Babylon, <lb/>
            near to Syria; because, had he croffed the <lb/>
            Euphrates, the rebels would have been im­ <lb/>
            mediately upon him. It was therefore judg­ <lb/>
            ed expedient, to order all the troops near <lb/>
            at hand to march forth ; and to iffue a pro­ <lb/>
            clamation, commanding all the forces, where- <lb/>
            foever difperfed, to alembic on the banks <lb/>
            of the Euphrates. The Perfians can, with <lb/>
            the greater eafe, raife an army; Cyrus, <lb/>
            their <note type="footnote"> * </note> <lb/>

            ordinance, fetling, which nations fhould fur­ <lb/>
            nifh the cavalry, and what number; which <lb/>
            people the infantry, and how many; which <lb/>
            the bow-men and their number; which Should <lb/>
            fend chariots armed with fcythes, or un­ <lb/>
            armed ; from what region the elephants were <lb/>
            to come, and how many : likewise the other <lb/>
            articles, each country, refpectively, was to <lb/>
            contribute. Now all thefe contingents could <lb/>
            be provided, by the various nations, in as <lb/>
            fhort a time as a fingle man can fit out <lb/>
            himfelf.</p>
          <p>IX. The fifth day after the arrival of the <lb/>
            news, the king marched from Babylon, fol­ <lb/>
            lowed by thofe who were of age to bear <note type="footnote"> H 3 </note> <lb/>
            arms; <lb/>
             <pb n="102"/>
            arms; all fuch being ordered to attend. <lb/>
            Among them came Dionyfius, who was aa <lb/>
            Ionian ; for no fubject or dependent was per­ <lb/>
            mitted to flay behind. Being clad in rich <lb/>
            and beautiful armour, and his attendants <lb/>
            forming a considerable band; he took poft <lb/>
            among the firft and moft illuftrious perfo­ <lb/>
            nages. Dionyfius feemed to meditate fome <lb/>
            great exploit, he being naturally ambitious : <lb/>
            and entertaining the higheft idea of valour, <lb/>
            he thought it one of the nobleft virtues. <lb/>
            He likewife had fome faint hopes, that could <lb/>
            he make himself of ufe in this war, he then <lb/>
            might escape the law-fuit; and receive Cal­ <lb/>
            lirrhoe from the king, as a recompence for <lb/>
            his bravery. The queen would not take <lb/>
            Callirrhoe with her, and therefore did <lb/>
            not <lb/>
             <pb n="103"/>
            not once mention her to the king; nor afk <lb/>
            him how the foreigner fhould be difpofed of. <lb/>
            Artaxates was alfo filent on this head ; he <lb/>
            not daring, as his Sovereign was in fo much <lb/>
            danger, to remind him of an amour. The <lb/>
            truth was, he would gladly have got rid of <lb/>
            Callirrhoe, as of a wild beaft ; and it is my <lb/>
            opinion, that he was pleafed with the war, <lb/>
            fince it might cure the king of a paffion <lb/>
            which indolence had begun and fomented. <lb/>
            But Artaxerxes did not forget Callirrhoe; <lb/>
            he, even amid the inexpreffible tumult and <lb/>
            confufion, recalling her beauty to his memory. <lb/>
            And yet he was not willing to fay what <lb/>
            Should be done with her, left he might betray <lb/>
            a childifh weakness ; by having mentioned a <lb/>
            beautiful woman, in the beginning of fo <lb/>
            mighty a war. However the king, urged'by <note type="footnote"> H 4 </note> <lb/>
            the <lb/>
             <pb n="104"/>
            violence of his flame, thought of the follow­ <lb/>
            ing artifice, but unknown either to Statira <lb/>
            or to the eunuch; though the latter knew <lb/>
            of his paffion. It is cuftomary for the king, <lb/>
            and the chief men among the Perfians, when <lb/>
            they go to war, to take with them their <lb/>
            wives and children; their gold, filver, and <lb/>
            apparel ; their eunuchs, concubines, and <lb/>
            tables; as likewise their precipus furniture, <lb/>
            and all their instruments of luxury. The <lb/>
            king then lent for the fuperintendant over <lb/>
            all there matters; and after much difcourfe <lb/>
            with bim, and giving orders with refpect to <lb/>
            every particular article; he at laft mentioned <lb/>
            Callirrhoe, when affuming an air of indif­ <lb/>
            ference, as though he had not the leaft re­ <lb/>
            gard for her: Let that poor, foreign <lb/>

            have undertaken to hear, follow the other <lb/>
            women. Thus did Callirrhoe leave Baby­ <lb/>
            lon, and very willingly, as fhe hoped that Chæ­ <lb/>
            reas would quit it alfo. She calling to mind, <lb/>

            ciffitudes are often of advantage to the un­ <lb/>
            happy; and that poffibly a period would be <lb/>

            had therefore thought of the following stra­ <lb/>
            tagem. At his fetting out for the war, he <lb/>
            left a perfon to inform Chæreas That <lb/>
            the king of Persia, being in want of allies, <lb/>
            had rent Dionysius to raife forces againft the <lb/>
            Egyptians; and, to induce him to ferve <lb/>
            with fidelity and difpatch, had restored to <lb/>
            him Callirrhoe.—Chæreas immediately gave <lb/>
            credit to what he heard, the unfortunate <lb/>
            being very eafily impofed upon. And now <lb/>
            tearing his cloaths and his hair, and touting <lb/>
            his breaft, he thus cried :- 0 faithless <lb/>
            Babylon! 0 abominable receptacle ! and quite <lb/>
            a defart with regard to me! Moft admirable <lb/>
            judge, thus a pander to another man's wife ! <lb/>
            Nuptials in the raidst of war I was medi­ <lb/>
            tating and preparing my caufe; and am fully <lb/>
            persuaded that I should have pleaded it with <lb/>
            truth <lb/>
             <pb n="110"/>
            truth and eloquence. But I now am con­ <lb/>
            demned though absent; and Dionyfius, who <lb/>
            has sled from the trial, is victor without having <lb/>
            uttered a fingle word. He yet shall not en­ <lb/>
            joy his conqueft ; for Callirrhoe will not bear <lb/>
            to live, thus fevered from her Chæreas, who <lb/>
            is Hill living, and here prefent. He deceived <lb/>
            Callirrhoe at firft, by making her believe that <lb/>
            I was dead. Why then do I not murther <lb/>
            myself before the palace; and pour forth <lb/>
            my blood at the gates of my judge ? Let <lb/>
            the Perfians and Medes know the injustice <lb/>
            of the king's decision. Polycharmus find­ <lb/>
            ing that no words, no arguments could <lb/>
            divert Chæreas from his fad resolution; and <lb/>
            that it would be impoffible to save him, spake <lb/>
            thus: There was a time (my deareft <lb/>
            friend !) when sost language from me, could, <lb/>
            give <lb/>
             <pb n="111"/>
            give thee consolation; and fach has often <lb/>
            prevented thy destroying tbyfelf: but I now <lb/>
            think thou doft determine most wifely; and, <lb/>
            so far from being an obstacle on this occafion, <lb/>
            I rather am prepared to die with thee. Let <lb/>
            us then confider which is the noblest kind of <lb/>
            death; for that mentioned by thee, though <lb/>
            it might cast an odium on the king, and dis­ <lb/>
            grace him with posterity; yet would it not <lb/>
            be a revenge adequate to the evils we have <lb/>
            suffered. I therefore am of opinion, that <lb/>
            the death, to which we muft one day submit, <lb/>
            ought to be employed in taking vengeance on <lb/>
            the tyrant. How glorious will it be, after <lb/>
            our having made a mighty daughter of the <lb/>
            troops of our foe; and done him every other <lb/>
            mifchief, to force him to repent ? How much <lb/>
            will it redound to our glory, when it shall <note type="footnote">9 </note> <lb/>
            be <lb/>

            be related in hiftory, that two Greeks, whd <lb/>
            had been wronged by an unjuft fentence of <lb/>
            the great king; afterwards revenged their <lb/>
            injuries, and died as became brave men ? <lb/>
            But how (refumed Chæreas,) will it be pof­ <lb/>
            fible for us, indigent and banifhed men, fing- <lb/>
            Jy to annoy a prince, master of so many and <lb/>
            fuch powerful nations; and commander over <lb/>
            fuch mighty armies, as we ourfelves saw; a <lb/>
            prince protected and furrounded by fo vast a <lb/>
            number of centinels and body-guards ? and <lb/>
            though we should happen, at last, to kill one <lb/>
            of thefe, or burn one of his palaces ; he yet <lb/>
            would not feel the loss.——Thy arguments, <lb/>
            (replied Polycharmus) were just, was not this <lb/>
            a time of war: But now advice is brought <lb/>
            that Egypt has taken up arms; that Phœ­ <lb/>
            nicia is conquered, and Syria is overrun : and <lb/>
            that <lb/>
             <pb n="113"/>
            that the king will be attacked even before he <lb/>
            crosses the Euphrates: We therefore are not <lb/>
            alone; but have, in our aid, as many com­ <lb/>
            panions ; as great a quantity of arms; as <lb/>
            numerous forces, and as many ships, as the <lb/>
            Egyptian now possesses, Let us then make <lb/>
            ufe of his troops to revenge our wrongs. <lb/>
            Polycharmus had not ended, when Chaereas <lb/>
            cried aloud Away to the army! I will <lb/>
            take justice on my judge in the field.</p>
          <p>If. They then fet out with amazing fpeed <lb/>
            after the king, as if it had been their inten­ <lb/>
            tion to join him; they hoping, upon that <lb/>
            pretence, to have an opportunity of fafely <lb/>
            crowing the Euphrates. They got up with <lb/>
            the army upon the banks of that river; when <lb/>
            mixing with thofe who had the care of the <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> I </note> <lb/>
            birds, <lb/>

            birds., they went forward; but on their <lb/>
            arrival in Syria, deferted to the Egyptian. <lb/>
            They then were Seized by the centinels, who <lb/>
            examined them strictly; for as they had not <lb/>
            the appearance of embassadors, they were <lb/>
            looked upon rather as fpies: and would cer­ <lb/>
            tainly have been expofed to imminent danger, <lb/>
            had not a Greek, who was there by accident, <lb/>
            underwood their language. They then de­ <lb/>
            fired to be conducted to the king, as having <lb/>
            Something to offer which would be of great <lb/>
            Service to him. Being introduced, Chæreas <lb/>
            faid :—We are Greeks, and Patricians of Sy­ <lb/>
            racufe. My friend here came to Babylon <lb/>

            haft ever heard of Hermocrates the Prætor, <lb/>
            who defeated the Athenians in a naval en­ <lb/>
            gagement. The Egyptian faid, that he <lb/>
            was not a Granger to this victory; and in­ <lb/>
            deed every nation had heard of the calamities, <lb/>
            which the Athenians suffered, during the Si­ <lb/>
            cilian war. Chæreas added: The tyrant <lb/>
            Artaxerxes has exercifed the greater cruelty <lb/>
            ever us: -Saying which, they related every <lb/>
            particular. We therefore (continued Chæ­ <lb/>

            would have left the world long fince; and I <lb/>

          <p>The Egyptian was delighted with there words, <lb/>
            when ftretching forth his hand: Thou <lb/>
            art come, 0 young man ! (faid he) at a happy <lb/>
            juncture both for thyfelf, and for me. He <lb/>
            then inftantly gave orders that each fhould <lb/>
            ' be provided with arms and a tent. Not long <lb/>
            after, he made Chæreas his gueft, and, at <lb/>
            laft his counfellor; as he perceived, in him, <lb/>
            great prudence, fortitude, and fidelity; for <lb/>
            Chæreas was naturally of a good difpofition, <lb/>
            and had been liberally educated. But above <lb/>
            all, his conteft with the king fired him, and <lb/>
            rendered him ftill more confpicuous; as like­ <lb/>
            wife his ardent defire to prove himfelf a man' <lb/>
            who <lb/>
             <pb n="117"/>
            who was not to be defpifed, nor ill treated <lb/>
            with impunity; but, on the contrary, de­ <lb/>
            served every honour. Accordingly Chaereas <lb/>
            Soon performed a mighty exploit. The Egyp­ <lb/>
            tians had hitherto Succeeded with little dif­ <lb/>
            ficulty on all occasions; they, after the in­ <lb/>
            curfion, having poffeffed themfelves of every <lb/>
            part of Syria; and Seized on all Phœnicia, <lb/>
            Tyre excepted. The Tyrians are naturally <lb/>
            valiant, and ambitious of acquiring glory 4 <lb/>
            In order not to appear unworthy of Hercules <lb/>
            who is held, by them, in peculiar veneration; <lb/>
            they having dedicated their city almoft to <lb/>
            him only. The Tyrians depended likewise <lb/>
            on the ftrength of the place, for their city <lb/>
            was built in the midft of the ocean ; and a <lb/>
            narrow neck of land joining it to the conti­ <lb/>
            nent, it was, by that'means, almoft an ifland. <note type="footnote">I 3 </note> <lb/>
            This <lb/>
             <pb n="118"/>
            This city lay in the form of a Chip, which <lb/>
            coming into the harbour puts out its ladder <lb/>
            on fhore. Thus the Tyrians could eafily <lb/>
            repulfe an enemy, from what quarter foever <lb/>
            he might come: They keeping out the land <lb/>
            army by means of the fea (the harbour being <lb/>
            fufficient for that purpofe;) and the walls fe­ <lb/>
            curing them from the attacks of the gallies <lb/>
            or fhips; Tyre being furrounded by vaftly <lb/>
            ftrong fortifications, and inclofed by ports as <lb/>
            a houfe.</p>
          <p>III. Thus the Tyrians, as was before ob­ <lb/>
            served, were the only people who contemned <lb/>
            the Egyptians; though thefe had made a con­ <lb/>
            queft of every other country. This exafpe­ <lb/>
            rating the Egyptian, he fummoned a coun­ <lb/>
            cil of war, to which Chæreas was called, for <lb/>
            the <lb/>
             <pb n="119"/>
            the firft time ; when the former fpake thus : <lb/>
            Ye fee, my fellow foldiers ! (for I cannot call <lb/>
            ye fervants,) the great ftraits we are reduced <lb/>
            to; we being like a fhip which, after long <lb/>
            enjoying a profperous courfe, is, on a fud­ <lb/>
            dcn, buffetted by contrary winds. The ob­ <lb/>
            ftinacy of Tyre checks our rapid progrefs ; <lb/>
            and we hear that the king is pufhing forward. <lb/>
            How then are we to act, as we cannot poffefs <lb/>
            ourfelves of Tyre, nor advance without tak­ <lb/>
            ing it; fince, ftanding as a mid-wall, it fhuts <lb/>
            us out of all Afia ? I therefore think it ad­ <lb/>
            vifeable, to retire from hence as fpeedily as <lb/>
            poffible, before the Persian army fhall have <lb/>
            joined the Tyrians; as we otherwife fhall <lb/>
            run the hazard, of being taken in an enemy's <lb/>
            country. Now Pelufium is a well fortified <lb/>
            city, where we need not fear either the Ty- <note type="footnote"> I 4 </note> <lb/>
            rians, <lb/>
             <pb n="120"/>
            nans, the Medes, or even the whole world : <lb/>
            as the fands Are impaffible, and the accefs <lb/>
            to it very narrow. But the fea is open to us, <lb/>
            and the Nile is a friend to the Egyptians.- <lb/>
            The king having ended his fpeech, thofe <lb/>
            round him flood confounded, filent, and with <lb/>
            forrowful countenances; when Chæreas only <lb/>
            dared to express his Sentiments thus <lb/>
            O king! (faid he) for thou art truly a king, <lb/>
            and not him of Perfia, who of all men is <lb/>
            the moft wicked; thou grieved me to hear <lb/>
            thee talk of running away in the midft of <lb/>
            triumphs. We fhall certainly conquer if the <lb/>
            gods are propitious ; and be in poffeffion, not <lb/>
            only of Tyre, but of Babylon alfo. Many <lb/>
            obftacles arife in war; yet thefe fsould not <lb/>
            fuddenly fink our fpirits: on the contrary, <lb/>
            fortified by hope, we ought to put our hands <lb/>
            vigo­ <lb/>
             <pb n="121"/>
            vigoroufly to the work. Thefe very Tyrians <lb/>
            who now deride us, will I drag along; and <lb/>
            lay them naked, and in- chains, at thy feet. <lb/>
            If thou doft not credit my words, firft fa­ <lb/>
            crifice me, and then depart; for while I have <lb/>
            life, never will I fhare in thy flight. If thou <lb/>
            art firmly determined to go, leave me, at <lb/>
            leaft, fome few men, who may abide of their <lb/>
            own accord. Polycharmus and I are ardent­ <lb/>
            ly defirous of fighting manfully; and came <lb/>
            hither under the aufpices of the gods. <lb/>
            All were afhamed not to content to Chæreas's <lb/>
            propofal; when the king admiring his noble <lb/>
            fpirit, permitted him to felect, out of the <lb/>
            whole army, as many men as he might think <lb/>
            proper. Chæreas did not fet about the choice <lb/>
            rafhly, but entering the feveral tents, he <lb/>
            ordered Polycharmus to do the like; and, <lb/>
            ia <lb/>
             <pb n="122"/>
            in this manner he went through the whole <lb/>
            army, to fee if there were any Greeks. On <lb/>
            this occasion he found many mercenaries, from <lb/>
            among whom he drew forth only the Spar­ <lb/>
            tans, the Corinthians, and the Peloponne­ <lb/>
            fians. Here he met alfo with about twenty <lb/>
            v <lb/>
            Sicilians. Chæreas having then affembled <lb/>
            a body of three hundred men, he fpake <lb/>
            thus: -O ye Greeks ! as the king has given. <lb/>
            me leave to chufe, out of his whole army, <lb/>
            the flower of it, I have felected ye: for I <lb/>
            myfelf am a Greek, a Syracufian, and ori­ <lb/>
            ginally from Doris. Ye therefore muff fur­ <lb/>
            pars the Barbarians, not only in fplendor of <lb/>
            birth, but likewife in valour. Let none of <lb/>
            ye then dread the attempt to which I call ye <lb/>
            forth; for it will not be found above human <lb/>
            ftrength, nor perplexed with difficulties; <note type="footnote">4 </note> <lb/>
            thefe <lb/>
             <pb n="123"/>
            there being greater in imagination, than in <lb/>
            execution. As fmall a number of Greeks <lb/>
            withflood Xerxes at Thermopylae Now the <lb/>
            Tyrians are not five millions. On the con­ <lb/>
            trary, they are few ; very vain ; defpifers of <lb/>
            their enemies; and ftrangers to greatness of <lb/>
            foul, or wifdom in council. Let them then <lb/>
            know, how vaftly fuperior the Greeks are to <lb/>
            the Tyrians. However, I am not ambitious <lb/>
            of being your general; but ready to follow <lb/>
            him, among ye, who will chufe to bead the <lb/>

            I feeking not my own glory, but that of my <lb/>
            country.-Immediately all cried aloud: — <lb/>
            Be thou our captain !- Whereupon Chæreas <lb/>
            faid :Ye have bellowed on me the fu­ <lb/>

            will all acquire more wealth, and greater ho­ <lb/>

            armour, and furnished them with weapons of <lb/>
            every kind, led them to the royal tent. The <lb/>
            king was all aftonifhment at the light; and <lb/>
            could <lb/>
             <pb n="125"/>
            could not believe them to be the fame men ; <lb/>
            when promifing them noble rewards: Of <lb/>
            this, (faid Chæreas) we have not the leaft <lb/>
            doubt. In the mean time do thou keep the <lb/>
            reft of the forces under arms ; and draw not <lb/>
            near Tyre, till we fhall have made ourfelves <lb/>
            mafters of it, and call out to ye, from the <lb/>
            walls.—May the Gods grant (faid the king) <lb/>
            that this come to pafs.-Chæreas now drew up <lb/>
            his men clofe together, in order that they <lb/>
            might appear much fewer in number; when</p>

          </ab>
          <p>He then marched them towards Tyre, unfeen <lb/>
            at firft by the enemy. Approaching ftill <lb/>
            nearer, and being at laft fpied by the centi­ <lb/>
            nels on the walls ; thefe gave notice to the. <lb/>
            town, that a body of men was advancing, <lb/>
            but <lb/>
             <pb n="126"/>
            but without the lean fufpicion of their being <lb/>
            foes. Who indeed could furmife, that fuch <lb/>
            a handful of men would have presumed to <lb/>
            advance againft a moft powerful city, which <lb/>
            the whole Egyptian army dared not to be­ <lb/>
            fiege ? Being by this time come near to the <lb/>
            walls, the Tyrians afked who they were, and <lb/>
            what they wanted ? -Chæreas replied <lb/>
            We are Grecian mercenaries, who, have not <lb/>
            only been refused our pay by the king of, <lb/>
            Egypt, but even run the hazard of being <lb/>
            deftroyed by his machinations : and we appear <lb/>
            here in order to take vengeance, in con­ <lb/>
            junction with you, of our common foe. <lb/>
            Thefe words being reported to the people <lb/>
            within the walls, the gates were opened; <lb/>
            when the governor coming forth with only <lb/>
            a few <lb/>
             <pb n="127"/>
            a few men ; Chæreas firft flew him, and then <lb/>
            ran to the reft, when</p>

          <p>They now killed one another, like as when <lb/>
            lions fall upon a herd of oxen, whofe keeper <lb/>
            is not with them. Inftantly the city echoed <lb/>
            with fhrieks and lamentations; for few could <lb/>
            be eye-witneffes to the prodigious havock <lb/>
            then making, and all were in the utmoft <lb/>

            through the gates, in order to fee what was <note type="footnote"> * Chæreas's character seems very unami­ <lb/>

            doing; and to this was principally owing the <lb/>
            lots of Tyre : for thofe in the city ftruggled <lb/>
            with all their might to get out; while fuch <lb/>
            as were out of it, being cut with fabres, and <lb/>
            pierced by fpears, made as violent efforts to <lb/>
            force in. Meeting thus, and running againft <lb/>
            one another, they fell an eafy prey to the de­ <lb/>
            ftructive fword; and fuch heaps of dead <lb/>
            bodies lay before the gates, that it was not <lb/>
            poffible to lhut them. In this inexpreffible <lb/>
            confufion, Chæreas only retained his pretence <lb/>
            of mind and judgment; when forcing his <lb/>
            way through all oppofition, he got within the <lb/>
            gates. And now himfelf and nine more <lb/>
            afcended the walls, whence he called to the <lb/>
            Egyptians, who immediately rufhing forward, <lb/>
            the city was taken. The Egyptians being <lb/>
            thus matters of Tyre, were all joy and fefti­ <lb/>

            facrifices nor put on a crown; he faying:- <lb/>
            To what purpofe fhould I appear with any <lb/>

            ing received advice that Tyre was taken, he <lb/>
            was afraid for Sidon and all Syria; as he <lb/>
            found that the enemy would oppofe him with <lb/>

            check him in his career. Hereupon felecting <lb/>
            the flower of his army, he left, in the place <lb/>

            with the treafures, the rich veftments and <lb/>

            With regard to the future, let us not lofe <lb/>
            the conquers which now offer themselves , and <lb/>

            racufians defeated the Athenians in a naval <lb/>
            engagement. Thou now mull fight againft the <lb/>

            Thou <lb/>

            Thou wilt command the Egyptian gallies, <lb/>
            which are larger, and more in number, than <lb/>
            thofe of Sicily. Do thou then imitate, in <lb/>
            this expedition, the glorious example fet thee <lb/>
            by Hermocrates thy father-in-law.-—Dangers <lb/>
            of every kind (faid Chæreas) will be pleating <lb/>
            to me. For thy fake I undertook to wage <lb/>
            war with the king of Perfia, whom I mor­ <lb/>

            more as thou mayeft want. This was <lb/>
            put in execution forthwith, as matters preyed <lb/>
            exceedingly. And now the Egyptian, head­ <lb/>

            enemy; and Chæreas was appointed admiraL <lb/>
            This firft ftep difheartened infinitely the <lb/>
            foldiers, as Chæreas, their favourite, was <lb/>
            not <lb/>
             <pb n="135"/>
            DOt to command them; for, led on by him, <lb/>
            they never doubted of victory. This was <lb/>
            in fome meafure like plucking out an eye <lb/>
            from a huge body. On the contrary, thofe <lb/>
            on board the fleet were infpired with frefh <lb/>
            hopes and greater courage; as they were to be <lb/>
            headed by fo brave, fo excellent a com­ <lb/>
            mander. And now all the fea-captains, the <lb/>
            pilots, the mariners, and the foldiers, fo far <lb/>
            from loitering, were inftantly rouzed and in <lb/>

            valour. The battles were fought, on one <lb/>

            On this occafion the Egyptian infantry long <lb/>
            refifted the Medes and Perfians. but being <note type="footnote"> K4 </note> <lb/>
            at <lb/>
             <pb n="136"/>
            at laft overpowered by numbers, they were <lb/>
            forced to yield. Artaxerxes purfued them <lb/>
            with his cavalry; when equal was the ftrug­ <lb/>
            gle : the king of Egypt endeavouring to get <lb/>
            into Pelufium, and the Perfian monarch to <lb/>
            intercept him in his flight. The Egyptian <lb/>
            would perhaps have efcaped, had not Dio­ <lb/>
            nyfius firft routed all who oppofed him ; he <lb/>
            fighting valiantly near the king, in order to <lb/>
            be feen by him; and he performed wonders <lb/>
            during the whole engagement. As the pur­ <lb/>
            fuit of the enemy was tedious, and continued <lb/>
            day and night; Dionyfius obferving that this <lb/>
            troubled the king, fpake thus: Do not <lb/>
            (my Liege!) perplex thyfelf, for I will pre­ <lb/>

            thou wilt lend me a body of chofen cavaf­ <lb/>
            ry. The king applauded his fpirit, and <lb/>
            gave him five thousand horfe. Dionyfius <lb/>
            then marched, in one day, the number -of <lb/>
            miles ufually rode in two: when falling un­ <lb/>
            expectedly on the enemy, in the night, he <lb/>
            took a great number of them alive; flew <lb/>
            many more; and routed their whole army. <lb/>
            The Egyptian being feized alive, laid violent <lb/>
            hands an himfelf; when Dionyfius carried <lb/>
            his head to the king, who, at the fight of it, <lb/>
            cried :Thou fhalt be recorded in the <lb/>
            royal annals, as a benefactor to myhoufe; <lb/>

            to the gods; being firmly perfuadcd, that <lb/>
            he fhould henceforward continue the huf­ <lb/>

          <p>VI. Such were the tranfactions on land: <lb/>
            but Chæreas won a complete victory at fea ; <lb/>
            his enemies not daring to come out, and <lb/>
            face him with equal numbers: They not <lb/>
            coding the attack of the Egyptian gallies, <lb/>
            nor once turning their prows towards them; <lb/>
            but part fled with all the fail they could <lb/>
            croud; and part, running afhore, the crews <lb/>
            fell <lb/>
             <pb n="139"/>
            tell into the hands of Chæreas; and tht <lb/>
            ocean was covered with the wrecks of the <lb/>
            Median veflels. Artaxerxes knew not that <lb/>
            his fleet was overcome; nor did Chæreas hear <lb/>
            that the Egyptian army had been defeated; <lb/>
            on the contrary, both thought themselves <lb/>
            victors by fea and land. The fame day that <lb/>
            the battle was fought, Chæreas coming off <lb/>
            Aradus with his fleet, ordered his ships to <lb/>
            furround the island; and to keep fo sharp <lb/>
            a look-out, as might enable them to give <lb/>
            a good account, to their commander, of all <lb/>
            that past. Accordingly, those who had re­ <lb/>
            ceived there orders, drove the eunuchs, the <lb/>
            women-Haves, and all the populace into a <lb/>
            spacious square or market-place; on which <lb/>
            oc­ <lb/>
             <pb n="140"/>
            occasion the multitude was To great, that part <lb/>
            were forced to pars the night under porticos, <lb/>
            and part in the open air. Thofe of fome <lb/>
            rank were led to the town-house, where the <lb/>
            Archontes, or chief magnates, ufed to af­ <lb/>
            femble, and transact the business of the state. <lb/>
            The women fat on the earth round the queen ; <lb/>
            they having neither lighted up fires, nor re­ <lb/>
            ceived any sustenance; being fully perfuaded <lb/>
            that the king was taken prifoner; that the <lb/>
            Persians were totally undone; and that the <lb/>
            Egyptian had conquered every where. This <lb/>
            was a night, in Aradus, of the greater joy <lb/>
            to fome, and of the deepeR: affliction to <lb/>
            others: The Egyptians, on the one hand, <lb/>
            being delighted that the war was at an end, <lb/>
            and themselves freed from Persian flavery: <lb/>
            vhile, <lb/>
             <pb n="141"/>
            while, on the other hand, the Persian cap­ <lb/>
            fives exposed nothing but chains, outrages, <lb/>
            Scourges, slaughter; or, as the mildest pu­ <lb/>
            nishment, flavery. Statira, laying her head <lb/>
            on Callirrhoe's knees, wept. The latter being <lb/>
            a Greek, having had a generous education, <lb/>
            and been long conversant with adverfity, <lb/>
            greatly comforted the queen. Now it <lb/>
            happened, at this juncture, that an Egyptian <lb/>
            foldier, who flood guard over fuch as were <lb/>
            confined in the town-house, knowing <lb/>
            that the queen was there; he, struck with <lb/>
            the awe which all the Barbarians naturally <lb/>
            feel, on hearing the royal name pronounced, <lb/>
            dared not to approach Statira; but standing <lb/>
            at the door, which was fhut, he fpake thus <lb/>
            to Callirrhoe:——0 Lady! be not dejected, <lb/>
            for <lb/>
             <pb n="142"/>
            for the admiral knows not that thou art dixit <lb/>
            up here with the other captives; but when <lb/>
            this shall be told him, he will treat thee with <lb/>
            the ut most humanity, and take all Imaginable <lb/>
            care of thee. He is not only brave, but na­ <lb/>
            turally a lover of thy sex, and will make thee <lb/>
            his wife.——Callirrhoe, at thefe words, vent­ <lb/>
            ed a deep figh; and tearing her hair, burst <lb/>
            into the following exclamation:—— I now <lb/>
            am a slave indeed 1 0 strike a poniard to my <lb/>
            heart, rather than bring me rach tidings! I <lb/>
            cannot hear of marriage, and only with for <lb/>
            death. Let them murther me, let them <lb/>
            conTume me to ashes, I will not flir from <lb/>
            hence. This fpot shall be my grave. If <lb/>
            thy chiestain, (as thon fayest) is of a benign <lb/>
            and generous temper, let him grant me one <lb/>
            boon ; <lb/>
             <pb n="143"/>
            beon ;I mean, put an end to my life here.— <lb/>
            The soldier renewed his in treaties, yet Cal­ <lb/>
            lirrhoe would not rife from the earth, but <lb/>
            lay with her head covered. Hereupon the <lb/>
            Egyptian began to confider how he should <lb/>
            act ; he not daring to employ force, nor was <lb/>
            he master of eloquence fufficient to win her. <lb/>
            He then returned with a dejected count.. <lb/>
            nance to Chæreas, who fpake thus: — <lb/>
            What can all this mean ? I am robbed of <lb/>
            the most precious part of my booty; but I <lb/>
            will take vengeance on thofe who have done <lb/>
            this.——The soldier replied :——My Lord ! <lb/>
            no iniquity has been practised on this occa­ <lb/>
            sion: but the woman whom I found extended <lb/>
            in the market place, refuses to let me bring <lb/>
            her to thee. On the contrary, she is still <lb/>
            lying prostrete, and calling out for a fword, <note type="footnote"> * </note> <lb/>
            wishes <lb/>
             <pb n="144"/>
            wishes to die. Chærcas fmiling, cried:— <lb/>
            0 thou most ignorant of mortals! knowest <lb/>
            thou not the arts by which a woman is won ? <lb/>
            by foothing, by flattery, by promises ; and <lb/>
            above all, by making her fancy that she is be­ <lb/>
            loved. Thou perhaps mayeft have ufed vio­ <lb/>
            lence or opprobrious language :——In no <lb/>
            manner, (answered the foldier:) On the <lb/>
            contrary, I have not only done all that thou <lb/>
            haft now mentioned, but even twice as much. <lb/>
            I have invented a falsity with regard to thee, <lb/>
            by laying that thou wouldeft marry her, at <lb/>
            which the deemed moPe offended.—I furely, <lb/>
            (faid Chæreas) mull be vastly handfome and <lb/>
            engaging, fince this captive declares an a- <lb/>
            verfion, though she never faw me. Be this <lb/>
            as it will, she feems of a generous spirit. <lb/>
            Let no one therefore presume to employ <lb/>
            force; <lb/>
             <pb n="145"/>
            force; but leave her to act as she may think <lb/>
            proper. It is incumbent on me to revere and <lb/>

          <p>I. <lb/>
            I <lb/>
            T has been related, in the preceeding <lb/>
            book, how Chæreas, fuspecting that <lb/>
            Callirrhoe had been decreed to Dionyfius, <lb/>
            was fired with revenge, and revolted to the <lb/>
            Egyptian; who appointing him admiral, he <note type="footnote"> L 2 </note> <lb/>
            won <lb/>
             <pb n="148"/>
            won the empire of the sea : and how Chæ­ <lb/>
            reas, thus victorious, seized upon Aradus, <lb/>
            where Artaxerxes had left his contort, his <lb/>
            retinue, and Callirrhoe. Fortune was now <lb/>
            preparing an incident which was Scarce cre­ <lb/>
            dible, and of a forrowful call:; viz. Chæ­ <lb/>
            reas, though possessed of Callirrhoe, yet <lb/>
            knew not that she was in his hands; and <lb/>
            having taken the wives of other men on <lb/>
            board, he was failing away with them ; while <lb/>
            he left his own in Aradus; not as Bacchus <lb/>
            abandoned his wife Ariadne when asleep ; <lb/>
            but as a prey to his enemies. Hereupon Ve­ <lb/>
            nus, difpleafed at fo unnatural an event, re­ <lb/>
            folved to unravel and clear up the whole. <lb/>
            For the now began to be reconciled to Chæ­ <lb/>
            reas, with whom she before had been offend­ <lb/>
            ed, on account of his violent jealoufy, and <lb/>
            his <lb/>
             <lb/>
             <pb n="149"/>
            his ingratitude to her; after the had beftow­ <lb/>
            ed, on him, a moft beautiful gift; a gift more <lb/>
            precious than that which Alexander, called <lb/>
            Paris, bore away. And now Chæreas, having <lb/>
            fettled all matters with Cupid, and made <lb/>
            full satisfaction to that God, by having been <lb/>
            long toft, from Weft to East, and exposed to <lb/>
            numberlefs disasters : Venus took pity on the <lb/>
            wanderer; and determined to reftore, at <lb/>
            last, to each other, a most exquifitely-beau­ <lb/>
            tiful pair, whom she firft joined; and who <lb/>
            had undergone a vaft variety of sufferings, <lb/>
            both by fea and land.—I am of opinion, <lb/>
            that this laft book will be highly entertaining <lb/>
            to my readers; and expiate, as it were, for <lb/>
            all the mournful incidents in the former ones. <lb/>
            Robbers, slavery, trials, contests, fixed re­ <lb/>
            folutions to die; war, and captivity, will be <note type="footnote"> L 3 </note> <lb/>
            told <lb/>
             <lb/>
             <pb n="150"/>
            told no more -. but chafte loves, and lawful <lb/>
            nuptials, be the subjects of the following book. <lb/>
            I shall now declare, in what manner Venus <lb/>
            threw light over this obscure' affair; and <lb/>
            how Chæreas and Callirrhoe, not knowing <lb/>
            each other, were, by means of that goddefs, <lb/>
            reciprocally restored.— It was evening, and <lb/>
            many slaves were yet to be put on board the <lb/>
            gallies. Chæreas, who was greatly fatigued, <lb/>
            now rote up, to order and prepare the de­ <lb/>
            parture of his fleet. As he was palling <lb/>
            through the market place, the Egyptian said <lb/>
            to him :——Here (my Lord !) is the woman, <lb/>
            who will not go on board, and obfiinately <lb/>
            refolves to starve herself. But thou wilt <lb/>
            (perhaps) be able to perfuade her to rife ; <lb/>
            for why leave behind thee the moll: lovely <lb/>
            part of thy fpoils ? Polycharmus Second­ <lb/>
            ed <lb/>
             <pb n="151"/>
            ed this hint, he being vastly defirous of en­ <lb/>
            gaging Chæreas, if poffible, in a new amour ; <lb/>
            to console him for the lots of Callirrhoe : <lb/>
            upon which Polycharmus faid :—Chæreas !— <lb/>
            Let us go in. Having paft the threshold, <lb/>
            and feeing the woman Wretched on the <lb/>
            ground, with her head covered ; Chæreas im­ <lb/>
            mediately, from her breathing and the form <lb/>
            of her body, found himself greatly agitated, <lb/>
            and in fufpence; and would certainly have <lb/>
            then known again Callirrhoe, had he not <lb/>
            been firmly perfuaded, that she was gone <lb/>
            away with Dionysius. Hereupon approaching <lb/>
            very foftly :Woman ! (faid he) whoever <lb/>
            thou art, be comforted, for no violence shall <lb/>
            be offered thee; and thou shalt possess the <lb/>
            husband whom thou coveted. At. there <lb/>
            words, Callirrhoe, hearing his well-known <note type="footnote"> L 4 </note> <lb/>
            voice, <lb/>
             <pb n="152"/>
            voice, threw off her veil, and both cried <lb/>
            aloud: CHÆREAS !—CALLIRRHOE !— <lb/>
            when fondly clafping each other, they faint­ <lb/>
            ed, and fell on the ground. Polycharmus, <lb/>
            at fo wonderful and unexpected an event, <lb/>
            was at first struck dumb; but fpake as fol­ <lb/>
            lows, a little after. Rife! rife ! Ye now <lb/>
            are mutually restored. The gods have in­ <lb/>
            dulged the ardent wishes of both. However, <lb/>
            confider that ye are not in your native isle, <lb/>
            but in an enemy's country: and that it will <lb/>
            be necessary ye Should now fettle every thing <lb/>
            upon fo folid a footing, as may prevent any <lb/>
            future separation—Polycharmus pronounced <lb/>
            there words aloud : but the transported pair <lb/>
            heard them imperfectly; as persons, at the <lb/>
            bottom of a well, would a voice coming from <lb/>
            above. It was with great difficulty they re­ <lb/>
            covered <lb/>
             <pb n="153"/>
            covered from their extafy ; when fondly gaz­ <lb/>
            ing on each other, they repeated their kisses, <lb/>
            and again swooned away. This they did a <lb/>
            fecond, and a third time, saying only :-Do I <lb/>
            certainly fold thee ? Art thou, indeed, Cal­ <lb/>
            lirrhoe ? -Art thou really Chæreas? <lb/>
            Intently fame published, that the admiral <lb/>
            had recovered his contort. And now, not a <lb/>
            foldier continued in his tent; not a mariner <lb/>
            on board his galley; nor a porter, or feryant, <lb/>
            at a door; but the people flocked from all <lb/>
            parts, crying aloud :Thrice happy fair ! <lb/>
            to have thus found again her exquisitely­ <lb/>
            beautiful husband.—— Yet the moment Cal­ <lb/>
            lirrhoe appeared, praifes were no longer be­ <lb/>
            stowed on Chæreas ; but every eye gazed at <lb/>
            her, as though file only had been present. <lb/>
            Callinhoe now walked, with an air of ma­ <lb/>
            jesty, <lb/>
             <pb n="154"/>
            jelly, between Chæreas and Polycharmus. <lb/>
            Flowers and chaplets were Scattered over <lb/>
            them; and ointments, with wine, poured <lb/>
            forth at their feet. On this occasion were <lb/>
            united the two moft delightful articles, <lb/>
            in peace and war, viz. triumphs for victory, <lb/>
            and rejoicings for marriage. It had been <lb/>
            Chæreas's custom, always to lie on board his <lb/>
            ship ; and to fpend the greater part of the <lb/>
            night, as well as the day, in a variety of oc­ <lb/>
            cupations : but now, leaving all things to <lb/>
            Polycharmus, he, without waiting for night, <lb/>
            entered the royal bed chamber: for in every <lb/>
            city a palace is appropriated to the king. <lb/>
            Here flood a golden bed, whore coverlet was <lb/>
            of Tyrian purple, of Babylonish workman­ <lb/>
            ship. But O! what pen could describe the <lb/>
            night in which our blifsful pair related their <note type="footnote"> 2 </note> <lb/>
            respective <lb/>
             <pb n="155"/>
            respective adventures; intermixing them <lb/>
            with floods of tears, and numberlefs kisses ! <lb/>
            Callirrhoe began first, by telling him how <lb/>
            fhe recovered from her trance in the Maufo­ <lb/>
            leum, and was afterwards taken from thence <lb/>
            by Theron. She alfo related her voyage, <lb/>
            and how she had been fold.—Hitherto Chæ­ <lb/>
            reas had fhed tears while he listened to her <lb/>
            story ; but when she fpake of Miletus, she, <lb/>
            through modefty, was fient : upon which, <lb/>
            he, excited by his natural jealoufy, grew un­ <lb/>
            easy ; but the relation she gave of her fon, <lb/>
            foothed and confoled him. Hereupon <lb/>
            Chæreas, before she had ended, fpake thus:- <lb/>
            By what accident cameft thou to Aradus ? <lb/>
            Where didft thou leave Dionyfius ? and what <lb/>
            past between thee, and the king ! — Instant­ <lb/>
            ly Callirrhoe declared, with an oath, that fhe <lb/>
            had <lb/>
             <pb n="156"/>
            had not once let eyes on Dionyfius, fince the <lb/>
            trial: and that Artaxerxes certainly loved <lb/>
            her, but that he had never offered fo much <lb/>
            as to kits her.——I then, (continued Chæ­ <lb/>
            reas) have been very unjuft, and too preci­ <lb/>
            pitate in my anger; in bringing fo many evils <lb/>
            upon the king, fince he never injured thee. <lb/>
            When tome from thee, I was forced to de­ <lb/>
            fert; yet have I not done any thing, fince <lb/>
            that time, unworthy of Caliirrhoe; I having <lb/>
            filled both the land and fea with my trophies. <lb/>
            -He then told her all his actions minutely ; <lb/>
            and deemed not a little delighted, while re­ <lb/>
            lating his his own heroic achievements. —— <lb/>

          <p>II. It was yet night, when an Egyptian, of. <lb/>
            fome rank, arrived in a pinnace; and land­ <lb/>
            ing, cried haftily, and in fome confufion:- <lb/>
            Where is Chæreas? —— Being introduced to <lb/>
            Polycharmus, the ftranger faid, that he had <lb/>
            a fecret to communicate to Chæreas only; <lb/>
            and that the bufinefs he was come upon, was <lb/>
            vaftly urgent, and, required the quickeft dif­ <lb/>
            patch.—Polycharmus did not go in to Chæ­ <lb/>
            reas for a long time, he being unwilling to <lb/>
            difturb him unfeafonably. But the Egyptian <lb/>
            growing more importunate; Polycharmus, <lb/>
            opening the bed chamber door a little, told <lb/>
            Chaereas, that a perfon was come upon an <lb/>
            affair of infinite importance. Immediately <lb/>
            Chæreas, like an able captain, faid: — — <lb/>
            Bring in the man ; for war admits of. no de­ <lb/>
            lay. — The Egyptian being introduced, in <lb/>
            the <lb/>
             <pb n="158"/>
            the dead of night, and landing by Chæreas's <lb/>
            bed-fide: Know, (faid he) that the king <lb/>
            of Perfia has flain him of Egypt; and or­ <lb/>
            dered part of his army to march for that <lb/>
            country, to fettle matters there; while him­ <lb/>
            felf is advancing, with the remainder of his <lb/>
            forces, and will be here in a very fhort time. <lb/>
            Fbr hearing that Aradus was taken, he la­ <lb/>
            ments the lofs of the vaft treafures left by <lb/>
            him therein ; but is efpecially grieved, on <lb/>
            account of his contort, Statira.— —At thefe <lb/>
            words Chæreas carted from his bed, when <lb/>
            Callirrhoe, holding him, cried :—Whither <lb/>
            doft thou run, without firft deliberating on <lb/>
            the prefent flate of affairs ? for fhouldeft thou <lb/>
            fpread abroad this news, thou wilt kindle a <lb/>
            mighty war againft thy felf. All who hear <lb/>
            this will contemn thee ; and we, being again <lb/>
            made <lb/>
             <pb n="159"/>
            made captives, shall fuffer far greater cala­ <lb/>
            mities than before.——Chæreas complied in­ <lb/>
            stantly with her counsel ; when coming out <lb/>
            of the bed-chamber, he artfully took the <lb/>
            Egyptian by the hand : then calling his peo­ <lb/>
            ple round him, he said : — O my friends ! we <lb/>
            likewife have overcome the king of Perfia's <lb/>
            land forces. The man who now stands be­ <lb/>
            fore ye, has brought this joyful news, toge­ <lb/>
            ther with letters from the Egyptian monarch. <lb/>
            It is therefore our duty to fail, with all pof­ <lb/>
            fible expedition, to the rendezvous he ap­ <lb/>
            pointed. Be then the baggage got together, <lb/>
            and let all haflen to their respective gallies.— <lb/>
            The Infant thefe words were uttered, the <lb/>
            trumpet founded for every one to go on <lb/>
            board. All the booty, with the flaves, had <lb/>
            been fhipt the day before; and nothing was <lb/>
            then <lb/>
             <pb n="160"/>
            then left in the island, except fuch things as <lb/>
            were too heavy to be transported, or altoge­ <lb/>
            ther ufelefs. They then unfurled the fails, <lb/>
            and weighed anchor, when the harbour echo­ <lb/>
            ed with tumult and confufion ; and all were <lb/>
            varioufly employed. Chæreas, now coming <lb/>
            on board, gave private orders for failing to­ <lb/>
            wards Cyprus; as though it would be ne­ <lb/>
            cessary to take possession of that island, then <lb/>
            in a defenceless condition. The wind being <lb/>
            favourable, they Coon reached Paphos, where <lb/>
            flood a temple facred to Venus. Chaereas, <lb/>
            before they landed, tent cryers on shore, <lb/>
            to offer to the inhabitants peace and amity; <lb/>
            which being accepted, Chæreas ordered the <lb/>
            crews of the Several gallies to land ; when, <lb/>
            after bellowing rich gifts on Venus, and <lb/>
            getting together a great many victims, he en­ <lb/>
            tertained <lb/>
             <pb n="161"/>
            tertained the whole fleet at a Splendid ban­ <lb/>
            quet. Chaereas, confidering afterwards how <lb/>
            he should act ; the prices and footh-fayers <lb/>
            informed him, that the victims were propi­ <lb/>
            tious. Animated by this declaration, he af­ <lb/>
            fembled the captains of the ships ; his three <lb/>
            hundred Greeks ; and all the Egyptians whom <lb/>
            he knew to be in his intereft, when he fpake <lb/>
            thus:—My fellow - foldiers ! my companions <lb/>
            in mighty exploits, fo glorious to us all! <lb/>
            Joined with you, we could either make peace <lb/>
            with honour, or continue the war with fafety. <lb/>
            Experience has taught us, that we, by means <lb/>
            of the concord which has subsisted fo happily <lb/>
            between us, are become matters of the fea : <lb/>
            But things are on fuch a footing, at this junc­ <lb/>
            ture, that it will be incumbent on us to con­ <lb/>
            full immediately together, and provide for <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> . M </note> <lb/>
            our <lb/>
             <pb n="162"/>
            our future fecurity. Know then, that the Egyp­ <lb/>
            tian was slain in battle; and that the king of <lb/>
            Perfia has Seized upon all the continent; fo <lb/>
            that we are now Surrounded with enemies. <lb/>
            Is then any one among you of opinion, that <lb/>
            we should go to the king, and spontaneously <lb/>
            deliver up ourfelves into his hands ?Im­ <lb/>
            mediately they all, as with one voice, cried <lb/>
            aloud :——We will submit to any thing rather <lb/>
            than do this. Whither then shall we <lb/>
            efcape, thus encompassed by foes ? and it <lb/>
            will not be possible for us to By to the skies.— <lb/>
            At there words, all were silent, when a La­ <lb/>
            cedæmonian, cousin to Brasidas, whom dire <lb/>
            necessity had compelled, in dangerous times, <lb/>
            to leave his native country, was the first who <lb/>
            dared to fpeak: Why (fays he,) do we <lb/>
            endeavour to By from the king, while the <lb/>
            fea <lb/>
             <pb n="163"/>
            fea is open to us, and we are possessed of <lb/>
            Clips ? Both of thefe will convey us to Sicily, <lb/>
            and to Syracufe; where we stand not in fear <lb/>
            either of the Persian or the Athenians ?—All <lb/>
            applauded this advice, Chæreas excepted, <lb/>
            who pretended not to approve of it, by ob­ <lb/>
            serving, that it would be too long a voyage ; <lb/>
            though, in reality, he spake thus merely to <lb/>
            found them ; and to know whether they had <lb/>
            declared their real fentiments. However, <lb/>
            as they all grew exceedingly pressing, and <lb/>
            were eager to fet fail instantly, Chæreas <lb/>
            faid: O Greeks ! ye have taken an ex­ <lb/>
            cellent resolution, and I return you many <lb/>
            thanks, for the testimonies given me of your <lb/>
            good-will and fidelity; and rest assured, <lb/>
            that ye shall not repent of this, if the gods <lb/>
            favour our deigns. But the Egyptians, of <note type="footnote"> M 2 </note> <lb/>
            whom <lb/>
             <pb n="164"/>
            there are vaft numbers, mull not be forced <lb/>
            contrary to their will ; as moft of them have <lb/>
            wives and children, from whom they would <lb/>
            not willingly be feparated. Let then fome go <lb/>
            and enquire, among the multitude, the fen­ <lb/>
            timent of each man in particular: in order <lb/>
            that we may take with us none but volun­ <lb/>
            teers.—All the commands of Chæreas were <lb/>
            forthwith put in execution.</p>
          <p>III. Now Callirrhoe, taking Chæreas by <lb/>
            the hand, and drawing him afide, faid : <lb/>
            What are thy intentions Wilt thou take <lb/>
            Statira, and the beauteous Rhodogune, with <lb/>
            thee to Syracufe ?This question raised a <lb/>
            blush in Chæreas's cheek, when he replied: <lb/>
            — It is not for my own fake that I shall con­ <lb/>
            vey thefe women thither, but in order that <lb/>
            they <lb/>
             <pb n="165"/>
            they may be thy slaves. Immediately Cal­ <lb/>
            lirrhoe cried aloud: The gods forbid, <lb/>
            that I fhould ever be fo mad, as to permit <lb/>
            the queen of Alia to be my slave ; especially <lb/>
            as her perfon is, by the laws of hospitality, <lb/>
            facred to me! If therefore thou wouldeft <lb/>
            oblige me, fend her back to the king; since <lb/>
            the treated me, while under her care, with <lb/>
            as much kindnefs as if I had been her bro­ <lb/>
            ther's wife.Thou couldest not form a <lb/>
            with, (anfwered Chæreas) which I would not <lb/>
            indulge. Thou art mistress of Statira; of <lb/>
            my fpoils; but, above all things, of my <lb/>
            foul. Callirrhoe, overjoyed at this reply, <lb/>
            kissed her hufband ; and immediately ordered <lb/>
            the officers to conduct her to Statira, who, <lb/>
            with the most noble Persian ladies, was shut <lb/>
            up in a cabin, quite ignorant of all that had <note type="footnote"> M 3 </note> <lb/>
            passed ; <lb/>
             <pb n="166"/>
            parted; and not even knowing that Callirrhoe <lb/>
            was reflored to her darling Chæreas; the <lb/>
            queen being so Wrongly guarded that no one <lb/>
            could approach, or fee her; or even give <lb/>
            her the leaft information of any thing. So <lb/>
            foon as Callirrhoe entered the ship, attended <lb/>
            by the captain, amazement feized the people, <lb/>
            who ran up and down in confufion; when <lb/>
            one whimpered another, faying: The ad­ <lb/>
            miral's lady is coming. Statira perceiving <lb/>
            this, vented a deep figh, and weeping, cried <lb/>
            O fortune ! Thou haft preserved me till this <lb/>
            day, that I, a queen, might behold my mi­ <lb/>
            stress; who, possibly, is now come on board, <lb/>
            merely to fee what kind of nave the has <lb/>
            got. The other women now broke forth <lb/>
            into lamentations; on which occafion she <lb/>
            learnt how dreadful flavery is to noble, free- <lb/>
            born <lb/>
             <pb n="167"/>
            born minds. But God changed, on a fud­ <lb/>
            den, the face of things; for Callirrhoe, <lb/>
            being still on board, flew to Statira, and em­ <lb/>
            bracing her affectionately, faid :Hail 0 <lb/>
            Queen ! for a queen thou art, and a queen <lb/>
            thou fhalt ever remain. Thou art not <lb/>
            fallen into the hands of an enemy, but of <lb/>
            one who loves thee exceedingly ; and has re­ <lb/>
            ceived the strongest marks of thy benevo­ <lb/>
            lence. My Chæreas is admiral; an honour <lb/>
            to which his anger againft the great king <lb/>
            raised him, for his not restoring me imme­ <lb/>
            diately. But his animosity being now fubfided, <lb/>
            he is reconciled, and no longer thy foe. Rife <lb/>
            therefore (excellent Statira !) depart chear­ <lb/>
            fully, and do thou alfo recover thy consort; <lb/>
            for the king liveth, and Chæreas will fend <lb/>
            thee to him. Rife albo, Rhodogune! my <note type="footnote"> M 4 </note> <lb/>
            first <lb/>
             <pb n="168"/>
            first friend among the Persians, and go to thy <lb/>
            hufband; with as many more women as the <lb/>
            queen shall defire: and remember Callir­ <lb/>
            rhoe. Statira, at there words, was all <lb/>
            astonishment; not knowing whether the ought <lb/>
            to give credit to, or difbelieve, what she <lb/>
            heard. However, fuch was the rectitude of <lb/>
            Callirrhoe's heart, that she never jelled in <lb/>
            matters of consequence; and the present <lb/>
            crifis required the utmoft difpatch in all things. <lb/>
            There was then, among the Egyptians, a <lb/>
            philosopher, Demetrius by name, who was <lb/>
            well-known to the king ; a man advanced in <lb/>
            years; and excelling all his countrymen, in <lb/>
            learning and the study of virtue. Chæreas <lb/>
            calling him, fpake thus: I intended to <lb/>
            have taken thee with me; but I now will en­ <lb/>
            trust thee with a very important commiffion; <lb/>
            I mean, <lb/>
             <pb n="169"/>
            I mean, thou shalt conduct the royal consort <lb/>
            to the great king. Hereby thou wilt ingratiate <lb/>
            thyfelf Rill more with the monarch, and re­ <lb/>
            store the rest to his favour. Having fail <lb/>
            thefe words, he appointed Demetrius com­ <lb/>
            mander of the ships or gallies which were to <lb/>
            return home ; for all would follow Chæreas ; <lb/>
            they preferring him to their native country, <lb/>
            and to their children. However, he only <lb/>
            chore twenty of the bell: and largest gallies ; <lb/>
            as he deigned to crofs the Ionian fea. On <lb/>
            board of there he fhipt all the Greeks who <lb/>
            were then with him : as likewise fuch Egyp­ <lb/>
            tians, and Phœnicians, as he knew were <lb/>
            brave and vigorous. Many Cyprians went <lb/>
            voluntarily aboard on this occafion. Chæreas <lb/>
            rent all the rest to their homes, each with his <lb/>
            portion of the enemies spoils; fo that they <lb/>
            all <lb/>
             <pb n="170"/>
            all returned joyfully to their respective coun­ <lb/>
            tries, loaded with rewards and honours; <lb/>
            and no one who asked Chæreas a favour was <lb/>
            refuted it, Callirrhoe carried, to Statira, all <lb/>
            the rich vestments and the royal female or­ <lb/>
            naments. But the would not accept of <lb/>
            any of them, faying: Callirrhoe ! do <lb/>
            thou be decked with them, for thy inchant­ <lb/>
            ing frame claims princely attire. It is alfo re­ <lb/>
            quifite, that thou do have wherewithal to be­ <lb/>
            flow on thy mother, and to prefent to the <lb/>
            Deities of thy country. I have left many <lb/>
            more things of this fort in Babylon. May <lb/>
            the Gods grant thee a profperous voyage, and <lb/>
            land thee in Safety ; and mayest thou never, <lb/>
            never more be feparated from thy Chæreas ! <lb/>
            Thou haft acted with the strictest justice, to­ <lb/>
            wards me, in all things: and proved that <lb/>
            thy <lb/>
             <pb n="171"/>
            thy foul is as excellent as thy form is beauti­ <lb/>
            ful. The king, in giving thee in charge to <lb/>
            me, depofited an invaluable treafure.</p>
          <p>IV. Who could relate the very numerous, <lb/>
            and very different tranfactions of that day ? <lb/>
            Some were offering up vows, and others bid­ <lb/>
            ding farewell: Some were elated with joy; <lb/>
            and others plunged in forrow: Many were <lb/>
            giving commiffions reciprocally; and many <lb/>
            writing to their families and friends. Chæ­ <lb/>
            reas, among the rest, wrote a letter to the <lb/>
            king, in the following terms: ——Thou <lb/>
            waft meditating the trial of my caufe, and I <lb/>
            have gained it by the decifion of a moft up­ <lb/>
            right judge; for war is an excellent arbiter <lb/>
            both of right and wrong *. War has given <note type="footnote"> * How barbarous, how false a maxim is this ? </note> <lb/>
            me <lb/>
             <pb n="172"/>
            me not only my own wife Callirrhoe, but <lb/>
            thine also. I have not imitated thy dilatory <lb/>
            conduct, but instantly, and without thy de­ <lb/>
            firing it, now restore to thee Statira inviolate; <lb/>
            and a queen, even in captivity. However, <lb/>
            know that it is not me, but Callirrhoe, who <lb/>
            fends thee this gift; in return for which, we <lb/>
            request of thee to be reconciled to the Egyp­ <lb/>
            tians; it being the duty of all men, and ef­ <lb/>
            \ <lb/>
            pecially. of kings, to prevent evil *. Thou <lb/>
            wilt have Soldiers who love their fovereign; <lb/>
            they chusing to flay with thee, rather than <lb/>
            as friends, to follow me. Thus did Chæ­ <lb/>
            reas write. Callirrhoe alfo thought it in­ <lb/>
            cumbent on her to return thanks to Diony­ <lb/>
            Sius. That was the only thing the concealed <note type="footnote"> * Excellent doctrine! and the reverse of the <lb/>
            maxim above hinted at. </note> <lb/>
            from <lb/>
             <pb n="173"/>
            from Chæreas; for, knowing his jealous temper, <lb/>
            she kept this a fecret; and wrote to Dionyfius <lb/>
            in manner following : ——Cattirrhoe to Dio­ <lb/>
            nyfius, her patron and benefactor, greeting. <lb/>
            Thou didft deliver me out of the hands of <lb/>
            robbers, and from slavery. Be not incenfed <lb/>
            against me, I beseech thee, for my heart is <lb/>
            with thee, on account of our mutual son, <lb/>
            whom I earneftly recommend to thy generous <lb/>
            care; requesting that he be nurtured and <lb/>
            educated in a manner worthy of us. May <lb/>
            he never be subject to a ftep-mother ! Thou <lb/>
            haft not only a son, but a daughter albo. Two <lb/>
            children are fufficient for thee. Marry thy <lb/>
            fon when come to man's estate; and fend him <lb/>
            to Syracuse, that he may fec his grand-fire.— <lb/>
            Plangon, I greet thee. I wrote this with <lb/>
            my own hand. May health attend thee, <lb/>

             <pb n="174"/>
             <lb/>
            (good Dionyfius !) and blot not Callirrhoe <lb/>
            from thy remembrance. Having healed the <lb/>
            letter, fhe hid it in her bofom, and when the <lb/>
            departure was near, and all were going on <lb/>
            board; Callirrhoe, taking Statira by the <lb/>
            hand, conduced her to the fhip; where De­ <lb/>
            metrius had fet up a royal pavillion; with <lb/>
            fails of Babylonilh purple, interwove with <lb/>
            gold. Callirrhoe, with the fondeft caresses, <lb/>
            laid the queen on the bed, and fpake thus:— <lb/>
            Adieu, O Statira! preferve me tenderly in <lb/>
            thy memory, and write to me often at Syra­ <lb/>
            cufe. Every thing is eafy to the king of per­ <lb/>
            fia. I will make due acknowledgments, for <lb/>
            that kindness, to my parents, and to the <lb/>
            gods of Greece. To thee I recommend ray <lb/>
            fon, whom thou didft ufe to fee with plea­ <lb/>
            sure. Look on him as a trust depofited, by <lb/>
            me, <note type="footnote"> 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="175"/>
            me, in thy hands. At thefe words Cal­ <lb/>
            lirrhoe shed a flood of tears, and the women <lb/>
            burft into wailings. And now Cailirrhoe <lb/>
            leaving the ship, bowed to Statira ; and blush­ <lb/>
            ing, delivered her the letter, faying:—— <lb/>
            Give this to the hapless Dionyfius, whom <lb/>
            I earneftly recommend to thee, and to the <lb/>
            king. Confole him, I befeech thee; for I <lb/>
            am afraid he will lay violent hands on him­ <lb/>
            self, when Separated from me. The ,o- <lb/>
            men would probably have talked much longer <lb/>
            together; have broke again into lamentations, <lb/>
            and kissed each other; had not the pilots <lb/>
            given notice, that they were going to leave <lb/>
            the harbour. Callirrhoe, the moment before <lb/>
            she went on board, adored Venus, saying:— <lb/>
            Thanks to thee (0 Goddefs!) for the good I <lb/>
            now enjoy. Thou art reconciled to me at <lb/>
            last. <lb/>
             <pb n="176"/>
            last. Grant me then to fee again my native <lb/>
            Syracufe. A vast sea lies between, and tremen­ <lb/>
            dous waters are ready to receive me; yet shall <lb/>
            I not be under the leaft apprehenfions, if <lb/>
            thou but bear me company in the voyage.— <lb/>
            Not a single Egyptian went on board Deme­ <lb/>
            trius's ship, without firft taking leave of Chae­ <lb/>
            reas, and kiffing his head and hand; his <lb/>
            amiable conduct having won him universal <lb/>
            love. Chæreas permitted this fleet to fail <lb/>
            out first; when praifes, intermixed with kind <lb/>
            wishes, echoed through the wide-extended <lb/>
            ocean. Thus did thefe proceed on their <lb/>
            voyage.</p>
          <p>V. And now the Perfian monarch, having <lb/>
            triumphed over his enemies, had fent a per­ <lb/>
            son into Egypt, to fettle his affairs in that <note type="footnote"> 9 </note> <lb/>
            king­ <lb/>
             <pb n="177"/>
            kingdom; whilft himfelf hasted to Aradus, <lb/>
            where his conCoct had been left. But being <lb/>
            arrived near Chius and Tyre, and offering <lb/>
            sacrifices to Hercules for the conquers at­ <lb/>
            chieved by him; a courier brought advice, <lb/>
            that the Egyptian ships had sacked Aradus, <lb/>
            and left nothing upon that island. To this the <lb/>
            courier added a most forrowful piece of news, <lb/>
            viz. that the queen was no more.—On this <lb/>
            occasion the Perfian lords, upon pretence of <lb/>
            weeping for Statira, bewailed the death of <lb/>
            their respective relations or friends; one hav­ <lb/>
            ing lost his wife, another his lifter, a third <lb/>
            his daughter; and everyone fome kinfman, <lb/>
            or perfon dear to him. After the Egyptian <lb/>
            fleet had left Aradus, it was not known to <lb/>
            which fea it was bound ; when it happen­ <lb/>
            ed that the Perfians fpied, the day following, <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> N </note> <lb/>
            some <lb/>
             <pb n="178"/>
            tome Egyptian lips, whofe course was doubt­ <lb/>
            ful, bearing down upon them. The Per­ <lb/>
            fians were furprized at the fight, and knew <lb/>
            not what to make of it; but were much <lb/>
            more astonished, when they perceived the <lb/>
            royal standard flying in Demetrius's ship; <lb/>
            a thing never feen except when the king is <lb/>
            on board. This caufed a noife and confufion <lb/>
            as though an enemy had been near; when <lb/>
            they went instantly to Artaxerxes, and cried <lb/>
            thus: Perhaps another king of Egypt <lb/>
            may have rifen up !—Artaxerxes descended <lb/>
            hastily from his throne ; and running to the <lb/>
            sea-shore, made the signal for battle. The <lb/>
            king, as there were no ships at hand, drew <lb/>
            up fuch forces as were ready armed in the <lb/>
            harbour. By this time fome had bent the <lb/>
            bow, while others were going to hurl the <lb/>
            fpear; <lb/>
             <pb n="179"/>
            fpear; which Demetrius obferving, he gave <lb/>
            notice thereof to the queen, who coming <lb/>
            forth from under the pavillion, and shewing <lb/>
            herfelf to the multitude; they immediately <lb/>
            threw down their arms, and fell prostrate <lb/>
            before her. The king could not contain <lb/>
            himfelf; but leaping first into the ship, before <lb/>
            it was come clofe to the shore, he clafped <lb/>
            his confort with the utmost fondnefs; and <lb/>
            shedding tears of joy, cried :——Dearest <lb/>
            wife ! what gracious Deity has restored thee, <lb/>
            at last, to my longing arms ? That my queen <lb/>
            should be lost, and afterwards recovered, ap­ <lb/>
            pears equally incredible. By what magic is <lb/>
            it that I, who left thee on shore, now find <lb/>
            . thee at sea ? —— Statira replied :Thou <lb/>
            receivest me, as a gift, from Callirrhoe. <lb/>
            Artaxerxes, at this name, felt his former <note type="footnote"> N 2 </note> <lb/>
            wound <lb/>
             <pb n="180"/>
            wound bleed afrefh; when directing his eyes <lb/>
            to the eunuch Artaxates: —— Conduct me <lb/>
            (faid he) to Callirrhoe, that I may thank her <lb/>
            sor this kind act.—The queen anfwercd ;— <lb/>
            I will tell thee every thing; faying which, <lb/>
            they walked together from the harbour to <lb/>
            the palace. There Statira, having command­ <lb/>
            ed every one, (the eunuch excepted,) to <lb/>
            withdraw ; the related all that had pail in <lb/>
            Aradus, and in Cyprus; and, at last, de­ <lb/>
            livered Chæreas's letter to the king, who, <lb/>
            after reading it, found himfelf agitated by <lb/>
            numberlefs paffions. He was exasperated <lb/>
            that thofe he held moft dear had been made <lb/>
            captives: He was forry, that himfelf had <lb/>
            forced Chaereas to desert from his Service; <lb/>
            and yet he thought himfelf obliged to Chæ­ <lb/>
            reas, for having taken Callirrhoe for ever <lb/>
            from <lb/>
             <pb n="181"/>
            from his sight. But, of all the passions, envy <lb/>
            tortured him most, he crying: Thrice <lb/>
            happy Chæreas, and much more fortunate <lb/>
            than me! —After they had talked over <lb/>
            every thing, Statira desired the king to com­ <lb/>
            fort Dionyfius: she observing, that this was <lb/>
            Callirrhoe's requeft. Hereupon Artaxerxes, <lb/>
            turning to the eunuch: Let Dionyfius <lb/>
            (said the monarch ;) come in. And now <lb/>
            the Ionian, elated with the most fanguine <lb/>
            hopes, instantly obeyed the royal Summons; <lb/>
            he being totally ignorant of the victories <lb/>
            won by Chæreas ; imagining that Callirrhoe <lb/>
            was with the other women ; and that he was <lb/>
            fent for, by the king, in order for her to <lb/>
            be restored to him, as a reward for his <lb/>
            important services. Dionyfius was no fooner <lb/>
            introduced, than Artaxerxes related to him <note type="footnote"> N 3 </note> <lb/>
            every <lb/>
             <pb n="182"/>
            every particular. On this occasion the Ionian <lb/>
            Showed uncommon wifdom, and fortitude of <lb/>
            mind: and, like one who should Hand un­ <lb/>
            moved, when a thunder-bolt fell at his feet; <lb/>
            he heard, with furprizing calmness, the follow­ <lb/>
            ing words, more dreadful than thunder, pro­ <lb/>
            nounced, viz. That Chæreas was con­ <lb/>
            ducting Callirrhoe back toSyracufe :—Diony­ <lb/>
            srus not thinking it late for him to reveal his <lb/>
            sorrow, as the queen was found again.— <lb/>
            Most willingly, (said the king) 0 Dionysius ! <lb/>
            would I restore Callirrhoe to thee, was it <lb/>
            in my power; as thou hast given me the moft <lb/>
            shining proofs of thy affection and fidelity. <lb/>
            But as this is impossible, I now beflow <lb/>
            on thee the government of all Ionia; and <lb/>
            thou shalt be enrolled, in the public records, <lb/>
            as the chief benefactor to the royal house.— <lb/>
            Dionyfius <lb/>
             <pb n="183"/>
            Dionyfius then fell prostrate before his fo­ <lb/>
            vereign; expreffing the deep fenfe of his <lb/>
            great obligations to him. He then hafted <lb/>
            away, in order that, when alone, he might <lb/>
            weep at full liberty. Statira, as he was de­ <lb/>
            parting, gave him the letter privately. Dio­ <lb/>
            nyfius being returned home, fhut himfelf up; <lb/>
            when well knowing Callirrhoe's hand writing, <lb/>
            he firft kissed the letter; then opened, and <lb/>
            preffing it to his bofom, held it there a long <lb/>
            time, as though the adored Callirrhoe had <lb/>
            been prefent; his fast-flowing tears not per­ <lb/>
            mitting him to read it. After taking his <lb/>
            fill of weeping, he began to perufe it, and <lb/>
            firft kissed Callirrhoe's name ; when coming <lb/>
            to thefe words: To Dionysius, her patron and <lb/>
            benefactor :—Alas! (said he) no longer huf­ <lb/>
            band ; Then continuing:—For thou art <note type="footnote"> N 4 </note> <lb/>
            my <lb/>
             <pb n="184"/>
            my patron and benefactor, —— What good <lb/>
            (faid Dionyfius) can I have done thee, to <lb/>
            merit that title ?-With regard to the letter, <lb/>
            Dionyfius was belt pleated with the excuse <lb/>
            in it; and he read the fame words over and <lb/>
            over again, as Callirrhoe deemed to have left <lb/>
            hull against her will; fo volatile is love, and <lb/>
            fo eafily do we perfuade ourfelves that we <lb/>
            are beloved. Then gazing on his fon ; lifting <lb/>
            him up, and fondly clafping him feveral <lb/>
            times: Thou, 0 my child! (faid he) <lb/>
            wilt one day go to thy mother, since it is <lb/>
            her injunction: while haplefs I shall fpend <lb/>
            my sad days in Solitude, having brought all <lb/>
            thefe evils upon myfelf. A foolifh jealoufy, <lb/>
            and Babylon, proved my ruin.-Having fpoke <lb/>
            thus, he prepared to go down to Ionia with <lb/>
            all poffible expedition ; imagining that the <lb/>
            length <lb/>
             <pb n="185"/>
            length, and the diversity of the journey; his <lb/>
            command over fo many cities ; and the <lb/>
            houses which Callirrhoe dwelt in at Miletus, <lb/>
            would foothe his profound melancholy.</p>
          <p>VI. Such was the situation of matters in <lb/>
            Alia ; during which Chæreas had a profpe­ <lb/>
            rOllS voyage to Sicily; the wind blowing <lb/>
            always right a-stern, and himfelf being in <lb/>
            the open sea with large gallies : notwith­ <lb/>
            standing which he was very much afraid, <lb/>
            that he poffibly fhould be expofed to the <lb/>
            rage of fome malicious Deity. Being come <lb/>
            within fight of Syracufe, Chæreas command­ <lb/>
            ed the captains to adorn their respective gal­ <lb/>
            lies ; and to advance in clofe order, as it was <lb/>
            a dead calm. The people in the city fpying <lb/>
            them, fame cried :Whence come there <lb/>
            lips ? <lb/>
             <pb n="186"/>
            ships ? Perhaps from Athens. Be Hermo­ <lb/>
            crates informed of this.— Immediately a <lb/>
            man hasted to him, and cried: —0 <lb/>
            Prætor ! what is to be done ? Shall we fhut <lb/>
            the ports, or put to fea, and meet yon gal­ <lb/>
            lies : for we know not whether a greater fleet <lb/>
            is not behind, of which thefe vessels may be <lb/>
            only the van ? —— Hermocrates, at there <lb/>
            words, flew from the public fquare to the <lb/>
            sea-shorej and fent out a pinnace, which <lb/>
            being come near to the fleet of gallies, the <lb/>
            captain of the pinnace haled them, and en­ <lb/>
            quired who they were? To this one of <lb/>
            the Egyptians, by Chæreas's command, re­ <lb/>
            plied :——We are merchants from Egypt, <lb/>
            and bring a cargo which will fill the Syra­ <lb/>
            cufians with joy. Do not then (faid the <lb/>
            other) come into the harbour all together; <lb/>
            for <lb/>
             <pb n="187"/>
            for the ships I fec are not trading vessels, but <lb/>
            long gallies; and feemingly fitted out for <lb/>
            war. Let therefore one galley only enter <lb/>
            the port, while all the reft lie out at sea.— <lb/>
            This fhall be done, said the other.-Here­ <lb/>
            upon, firft entered Chæreas's galley ; on the <lb/>
            deck whereof flood a pavillion, with Baby­ <lb/>
            lonish curtains round it. The moment it was <lb/>
            got near the harbour, this was instantly croud­ <lb/>
            ed; the common people being naturally cu­ <lb/>
            rious, and very fond of novelty; and they <lb/>
            then flocked to the port from a variety of <lb/>
            motives. At the fight of the pavillion, they <lb/>
            imagined that merchandize, of precious value, <lb/>
            was under it. Hereupon fome guessed one <lb/>
            thing, fome another; and all conjectured <lb/>
            every thing except the right; for it would <lb/>
            have been abfurd to fuppofe, that thofe who <lb/>
            thought <lb/>
             <pb n="188"/>
            thought Chæreas really dead, could believe <lb/>
            him to be returning to his native country with <lb/>
            a fleet of ships, and in fuch great fplendor. <lb/>
            The parents of Chæreas did not go out all <lb/>
            that day. Hermocrates attended as chief <lb/>
            magistrate on this occasion, but clad in <lb/>
            mourning, and in a private manner. While <lb/>
            the multitude were thus in doubt and fuf­ <lb/>
            pence, with their eyes fixed on the galley, <lb/>
            the curtains of the pavillion were fuddenly <lb/>
            undrawn; when Callirrhoe was discovered <lb/>
            in a robe of Tyrian purple, and reclin­ <lb/>
            ing on a golden bed; with Chæreas by <lb/>
            her fide, in the habit of chief admiral. <lb/>
            Never did thunder strike So forcibly on <lb/>
            the ear, nor lighting on the eye, as this <lb/>
            spectacle : nor did any man, at his finding <lb/>
            a treafure, ever break into fuch loud excla­ <lb/>
            mations, as did the populace at this unex­ <lb/>
            pected <lb/>
             <pb n="189"/>
            pected fight, which furpaft all the powers of <lb/>
            description. Hermocrates flying to the tent, <lb/>
            folded his daughter in his arms, and cried :— <lb/>
            Art thou then living (my child !) or do I <lb/>
            fee a phantom ? O father! (replied Callir­ <lb/>
            rhoe) I now really live, since my eyes behold <lb/>
            thee. Tears of joy ran down every cheek. <lb/>
            In the mean time, Polycharmus brought the <lb/>
            reft of the gallies into the harbour ; Chæ­ <lb/>
            reas having given him the command of the <lb/>
            whole fleet, ever fince their departure from <lb/>
            Cyprus ; it being impoffible for him to at­ <lb/>
            tend to any thing except his Callirrhoe. Im­ <lb/>
            mediately the port was filled; when the <lb/>
            fame spectacle was exhibited, as after a naval <lb/>
            engagement with the Athenians; the gallies <lb/>
            now returning crowned from the war,and com­ <lb/>
            manded by a Syracufian admiral. The voices <lb/>
            of <lb/>
             <pb n="190"/>
            of the multitude, faluting from the fea, were <lb/>
            blended with those which answered them <lb/>
            from shore : when repeated mutual, kind <lb/>
            expressions, praifes, and good wishes, echoed <lb/>
            round and round. Afterwards came Chæ­ <lb/>
            reas's father, who had fainted through ex­ <lb/>
            cefs of joy. All the youths brought up <lb/>
            with Chæreas, and who had been his com­ <lb/>
            panions in the Gymnafium, came and crouded <lb/>
            round him. They being vastly defirous of <lb/>
            faluting him; while the women flocked no <lb/>
            lees eagerly to Callirrhoe. She now appear­ <lb/>
            ed more beautiful than ever, in the eyes of <lb/>
            the people : and feemed a new Venus emerg­ <lb/>
            ing from the ocean. Chæreas then approach­ <lb/>
            ing Hermocrates, and his father, said : <lb/>
            Take ! 0 take the riches of the great king.— <lb/>
            At his command countless heaps of gold and <note type="footnote"> I </note> <lb/>
            Silver <lb/>
             <pb n="191"/>
            silver were instantly brought from on board <lb/>
            the galley. He afterwards produced, to the <lb/>
            Syracufians, ivory, amber, rich fluffs; and <lb/>
            every thing precious and fplendid, whether <lb/>
            with regard to the materials or workmanship; <lb/>
            together with the bed and table of the great <lb/>
            king : Insomuch that the whole city was now <lb/>
            filled, not as formerly in the Sicilian war, <lb/>
            with the mean goods and effects of the poor <lb/>
            Athenians ; but, (a furprizing and unheard <lb/>
            of circumstance !) with the Spoils of the Modes, <lb/>
            in time of peace.</p>
          <p>VII. Instantly the whole multitude cried :— <lb/>
            Be an assembly held :All longing to fee <lb/>
            and hear the united pair. And now the <lb/>
            theatre was crouded, in a shorter time than <lb/>
            words could exprefs, with men and women : <lb/>
            when <lb/>
             <pb n="192"/>
            when Chæreas entering fingly, all cried with <lb/>
            the loudeR: voice: Be Callirrhoe called :— <lb/>
            Hermocrates being greatly beloved by the <lb/>
            people, he, to oblige them, led his daughter <lb/>
            into the theatre. The populace first direct­ <lb/>
            ing their eyes to heaven, praifed the gods ; <lb/>
            and thanked them more for this day, than for <lb/>
            that on which they had triumphed over the <lb/>
            Athenians. They were afterwards divided <lb/>
            into two parties; the men applauding Chae­ <lb/>
            reas, and the women Callirrhoe : then both <lb/>
            together, which beft pleated the enraptured <lb/>
            pair. Afterwards Callirrhoe, being fatigued <lb/>
            with the voyage, and the violent agitation of <lb/>
            her fpirits, faluted her country ; and was <lb/>
            conduced home. But the assembly detained <lb/>
            Chæreas ; they being extremely defirous to <lb/>
            bear the entire relation of his voyage, and <lb/>
            the <lb/>
            2 <lb/>
             <pb n="193"/>
            the caufe of his absence. However, he be­ <lb/>
            gan by the last incidents ; being unwilling to <lb/>
            fadden the minds of the aflembly, by a de­ <lb/>
            tail of melancholy events. But they persisted, <lb/>
            faying: Begin, (as thou art requested) <lb/>
            from the first. Tell us all, and omit not a <lb/>
            single circumstance. Chæreas found a dif­ <lb/>
            ficulty on this occasion ; he being afhamed <lb/>
            to relate many things which had befallen <lb/>
            him, contrary to his will. But Hermocrates <lb/>
            laid :Blush not (my fon !) though thou <lb/>
            shouldest inform us of particulars which may <lb/>
            be derogatory to thyfelf, or excite our for­ <lb/>
            row; fince, as the end is honourable and <lb/>
            propitious, a veil will thereby be thrown over <lb/>
            all the paft. Whatever we fupprefs, raifes <lb/>
            a suspicion of fomething still worse, from our <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> O </note> <lb/>
            very <lb/>
             <pb n="194"/>
            very silence. Thou art fpeaking to thy <lb/>
            country, and to thy parents, for both of <lb/>
            which thou haft an equal affection. The <lb/>
            people are already acquainted with thy firft <lb/>
            adventures, as they gave thee in marriage. <lb/>
            We all know the snares prepared for thee <lb/>
            by thy rivals; which inflaming thee with <lb/>
            idle jealoufy, thou didft give thy wife an un­ <lb/>
            happy blow : that the, being fuppofed dead, <lb/>
            was interred with all possible magnificence: <lb/>
            and that thou, being charged with murther, <lb/>
            didft condemn thy self ; thou wishing to die <lb/>
            with thy wife: but that the people acquitted <lb/>
            thee, on finding the deed involuntary. What <lb/>
            followed has been told us: how the facri­ <lb/>
            legious Theron, having broke open the Mau­ <lb/>
            foleum in the night, and finding Callirrhoe <lb/>
            alive <lb/>
             <pb n="195"/>
            alive therein; put her, with all the female <lb/>
            ornaments and the sepulchral treasures, on <lb/>
            board a pyrate vessel, and fold her in Ionia. <lb/>
            In what manner thou, failing from Syracufe <lb/>
            in Search of thy wife, didft not meet with <lb/>
            her; but coming up afterwards at fea with <lb/>
            a pyrate vend, didft find all the robbers on <lb/>
            board her dead with thirst, except Theron, <lb/>
            whom thou broughtest alive before an as­ <lb/>
            fembly of the people; when he being put to <lb/>
            the torture, died at last on the crofs. Next, <lb/>
            how Syracuse, font out a galley, with an em­ <lb/>
            bassy on board, for Callirrhoe : and in what <lb/>
            manner Polycharmus accompanied thee spon­ <lb/>
            taneoufly in the voyage. Thefe feveral par­ <lb/>
            ticulars we already know. Do thou there­ <lb/>
            fore relate all that has happened to thee <note type="footnote"> O 2 </note> <lb/>
            since <lb/>
             <pb n="196"/>
            since thy departure from this city. Chæ­ <lb/>
            reas then proceeded thus : After having <lb/>
            happily eroded the Ionian feat we call an­ <lb/>
            char on the estate of a Milesian, Dionysius <lb/>
            by name; a man the most renowned in all <lb/>
            Ionia, for richer for birth, and for, glory. <lb/>
            It was he who bought Callirrhoe of Theron <lb/>
            for a talent :—Here be not afraid, (con­ <lb/>
            tinued Chæreas) she not being made a slave, <lb/>
            but becoming a mistress the instant she was <lb/>
            purchased; for as Dionysius loved her, he <lb/>
            would not ufe violence; nor could he, on <lb/>
            the other hand, prevail with himfelf to fend <lb/>
            back to Sicily, a woman whom he ido­ <lb/>
            lized. Afterwards Callirrhoe, finding that <lb/>
            she had conceived by out cohabitation; and <lb/>
            being desirous of preferving a citizen for <note type="footnote"> 4 </note> <lb/>
            you, <lb/>
             <pb n="197"/>
            you, fhe thence was reduced to the necef­ <lb/>
            fity of marrying Dionyfius ; and being de­ <lb/>
            livered feven months after of a fon, fhe art­ <lb/>
            fully pretended to have come before her <lb/>
            time; in order that the child might be fup­ <lb/>
            pofed the offspring of Dionyfius, and re­ <lb/>
            ceive an education fuitable to his high rank. <lb/>
            Thus (0 men of Syracufe) is your wealthy fel­ <lb/>
            low-citizen nurtured in Miletus, under the eye <lb/>
            of an illuftrious man. He is a Greek, and of <lb/>
            noble defcent. Let us then not envy the <lb/>
            child fo rich an inheritance. —Thefe parti­ <lb/>
            culars I was told afterwards.</p>
          <p>VIII. To return to my ftory. Land­ <lb/>

            tue of Callirhoe in a temple, I thence con­ <lb/>
            ceived fair hopes: but fotne robbers flying <lb/>
            over fea, came, in the dead of night, and <lb/>
            fct fire to our galley. They then murthered <lb/>
            moft of the crew ; and after throwing Poly­ <lb/>
            charmus and myfelf in chains, fold us in <lb/>
            Caria.—At there words the multitude burft <lb/>
            into moanings, when Chæreas fpake thus — <lb/>
            Permit me to fupprefs what befel us after­ <lb/>
            wards; as confifting of events far more fad <lb/>
            than any I have yet related. ——But as the <lb/>
            people clamoured aloud, and infifted on <lb/>
            hearing the whole, Chæreas went on as fol­ <lb/>
            lows. The man who purchased us was <lb/>
            Servant to Mithridates governor of Caria ; <lb/>
            and he commanded us, then fettered, to <lb/>
            plough <lb/>
             <pb n="199"/>
            plough the ground. About this time fome <lb/>
            of my fellow-slaves having killed their keeper, <lb/>
            Mithridates Sentenced us all to die on the <lb/>
            crofs. As I was leading to execution, and <lb/>
            going to fuffer, Polycharmus happened to <lb/>
            utter my name, which was well known to <lb/>
            Mithridates. This governor had been Dio­ <lb/>
            nyfius's gueft in Miletus; and was prefent <lb/>
            when my funeral obfequies were folemnized; <lb/>
            for Callirrhoe, on her being told concerning <lb/>
            the burning of the galley, and of the robbers,. <lb/>
            had concluded me to be dead ; and there­ <lb/>
            upon raifed a fplendid Mausoleum to my me­ <lb/>
            mory. Inftantly Mithridates ordered me, <lb/>
            when near expiring, to be taken from the <lb/>
            crofs; and afterwards ranked me among his <lb/>
            bofom friends. He next ufed his utmoft en- <note type="footnote"> O 4 </note> <lb/>
            deavours <lb/>
             <pb n="200"/>
            deavours to get Callirrhoe reftored to mei <lb/>
            and, for that purpofe, obliged me to write <lb/>
            to her. Now it happened that the letter, <lb/>
            through the carelefnefs of the meffepger, fell <lb/>
            into the hands of Dionyfius, who, not be­ <lb/>
            lieving me alive; but, on the contrary, <lb/>
            imagining that Mithridates wanted to deduce <lb/>
            his wife Callirrhoe, wrote forthwith to the <lb/>
            king of Perfia; falfely charging Mithridates <lb/>
            with a defign to draw her away. Hereupon <lb/>
            the monarch, being refolved to try the caufe <lb/>
            himfelf, fummoned all the parties to appear <lb/>
            at his court. This brought us to Babylon, <lb/>
            whither Dionysus conducting Callirrhoe, <lb/>
            her beauty, became, by that means, renown­ <lb/>
            ed throughout all Afia. On this occafion <lb/>
            Mithridates made me the companion of his <lb/>
            journey. <lb/>
             <pb n="201"/>
            journey. Being got to court, we ftrenuoufly <lb/>
            defended our great caufe before the king, <lb/>
            who foon acquitted Mithridates; and pro­ <lb/>
            mifed to judge whether Dionyfius, or my­ <lb/>
            felf, ought to poffefs Callirrhoe; who, dur­ <lb/>
            ing that interval, was committed to the care <lb/>
            of Statira. Think, (0 Syracufians!) think, <lb/>
            how often I fhould have laid violent hands <lb/>
            on myfelf, thus tome from a wife I adored; <lb/>
            had not Polycharmus, my only faithful <lb/>
            friend among the many who affumed that <lb/>
            name, withheld my hand. The king ne­ <lb/>
            glected the trial; he himfelf being enamour­ <lb/>
            ed with Callirrhoe; though he had not re­ <lb/>
            course to perfuafive arts, nor employed vio­ <lb/>
            lence. In the mean time, Egypt breaking <lb/>
            into open rebellion, a mighty war enfued, <lb/>
            which <lb/>
             <pb n="202"/>
            which yet has been 6f the higher advantage <lb/>
            to me: for the queen, having taken Callir­ <lb/>
            rhoe with her, I was deceived by a falfe re­ <lb/>
            port, declaring that file had been decreed to <lb/>
            Dionyfius; which firing me with revenge, <lb/>
            I deferted from the king of Perfia to the <lb/>
            Egyptian. On this occafion, great exploits <lb/>
            were atchieved by me ; I feizing upon Tyre <lb/>
            which was almoft impregnable. Being then <lb/>
            appointed admiral, I overcame the king of <lb/>
            Perfia in a naval engagement; and took <lb/>
            Aradus, where Artaxerxes had lodged Sta­ <lb/>
            tira; with the immenfe riches which you <lb/>
            have feen. Thus could I have made the <lb/>
            Egyptian matter of all Afia, had not that <lb/>
            monarch, fighting apart from me, loft his <lb/>
            life in battles I now have gained you the <note type="footnote"> I </note> <lb/>
            king <lb/>
             <pb n="203"/>
            king of Perfia's favour, by my reftoring to <lb/>
            him his confort ; and by fending back, to <lb/>
            the chief of the Perfian nobility, either their <lb/>
            mothers, their lifters, their wives, or <lb/>
            their daughters. I have brought hither the <lb/>
            moft valiant among the Greeks, with fuch <lb/>
            Egyptians as would follow me voluntarily: <lb/>
            and another of your fleets, commanded by <lb/>
            the grand-fon of Hermocrites, will, in due <lb/>
            time, come hither from Jonia. ——Thefe­ <lb/>
            words were no sooner-uttered, than the <lb/>
            whole multitude fhouted for joy, and im­ <lb/>
            plored every bleffing on his head. Chæreas, <lb/>
            after he had prevailed with them to be fi­ <lb/>
            lent: fpake thus Let Callirrhoe and I <lb/>
            return, in your presence, the warmer thanks <lb/>
            to our friend Polycharmus; he having given <lb/>
            us <lb/>
             <pb n="204"/>
            us the sincerest, the strongest marks of his <lb/>
            affection and fidelity; fo that, if you ap­ <lb/>
            prove of it, we will bestow on him our sister <lb/>
            in, marriage, with part of the fpoils as her <lb/>
            dowry. The people, with the louder <lb/>
            shouts, approved of this propofal, crying:- <lb/>
            We (0 Polycharmus !) do return thee thanks, <lb/>
            thou most excellent of men, and most faithful <lb/>
            of friends! Thou haft done important fer­ <lb/>
            vices to thy country, and art worthy of Her­ <lb/>
            mocrates and of Cbæreas. Chæreas, after <lb/>
            these acclamations, fpake as follows:I <lb/>
            intreat ye to bellow the freedom of your city <lb/>
            on thefe three hundred Greeks, my powerful <lb/>
            army.— To this alfo the people, with re­ <lb/>
            peated shouts, consented, crying: They <lb/>
            are worthy to be our sellow-citizens. —— <lb/>
            The <lb/>
             <pb n="205"/>
            The votes being taken, they were declared <lb/>
            duly elected, and enrolled as citizens accord­ <lb/>
            ingly. And now taking their feats, they <lb/>
            formed part of the assembly. When Chx­ <lb/>
            reas prefented each of them with a talent ; <lb/>
            and Hermocrates gave every Egyptian a piece <lb/>
            of land to cultivate. While the people con­ <lb/>
            tinued yet in the theatre, Callirrhoe, before <lb/>
            she returned home, went to the temple of <lb/>
            Venus ; when clafping her feet, she fell pro­ <lb/>
            strate with her hair disheveled; and killing <lb/>
            the Goddefs, fpake thus Venus! I thank <lb/>
            thee for having fet Chæreas again before me <lb/>
            in Syracufe; where, by thy favour, I first <lb/>
            when a virgin, beheld him. I do not now <lb/>
            reproach thee (O Deity!) for ray past woes, <lb/>
            I having been decreed to suffer them. I only <lb/>

            befeech thee to never Separate me more from <lb/>
