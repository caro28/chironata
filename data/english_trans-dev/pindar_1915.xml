          <p>IN preparing the following prose translation, I have endear­ <lb/>
            voured to exhibit such a rendering of the text as I should <lb/>
            myself have been glad to have, when preparing for a Uni­ <lb/>
            versity Examination.</p>
          <p>Any one who is at all acquainted with the difficulty of <lb/>
            the author, will readily pardon my having in no case ventured <lb/>
            to substitute any phraseology of my own for what I be­ <lb/>
            lieved to be the literal meaning.</p>
          <p>I have to express the greatest possible obligations to the <lb/>
            commentaries of Boeckh and Dissen, but for the assistance <lb/>
            of which I should hardly have ventured on my present task. <lb/>
            Many thanks are also due for the aid afforded by Mr. <lb/>
            Cookesley's excellent notes, as well as those of Dr. Donald­ <lb/>
            son. I have, I trust, in every instance, acknowledged my <lb/>
            obligations.</p>
          <p>If I have in any degree succeeded in presenting the <lb/>
            student with a not-unworthy representation of Pindar's <lb/>
            meaning, the merit is mainly to be attributed to these <lb/>
            resources and to the great kindness of three excellent friends, <lb/>
            the Rev. J. Lonsdale, M.A., Fellow of Balliol College, <lb/>
            Oxford; the Rev. John G. Sheppard, M.A., 2nd Master of <lb/>
            Repton School, and late Fellow of Wadham College ; and <lb/>
            Mr. J. LL Davies, B.A., Fellow of Trinity College, Cam­ <lb/>
            bridge ; who have given me the benefit of their revision <lb/>
            and correction throughout the whole work.</p>
          <p>With the few exceptions pointed out as they occur, I <lb/>
            have followed the text of Bergk, from whom the Prefaces <lb/>
            also are taken. Dr. Donaldson had set me the example of <lb/>
            adopting the Introductions of the Odes from Dissen's <lb/>
            Commentary.</p>

          <p>PINDAR, the most celebrated of the lyric poets of Greece, <lb/>
            was a native of Thebes, the metropolis of Boeotia, which <lb/>
            country his name alone might redeem from the stigma of <lb/>
            dulness. His birth seems to have taken place about <lb/>
            B.C. 520. According to some writers, the name of his <lb/>
            father was Daiphantus; according to others, Scopilenus; <lb/>
            and that of his mother, Myrto, or Myrtis. It is related of <lb/>
            him, that when he was an infant a swarm of bees settled <lb/>
            on his lips, and left their honey there-an omen of his <lb/>
            future excellence in arts of poetry and music. The history <lb/>
            of Pindar's early days seems to' refute in some degree the <lb/>
            opinion of those who think education has a tendency to <lb/>
            repress originality of genius, and to tame it down into <lb/>
            dexterous imitation or humble correctness. No poet, per­ <lb/>
            haps, ever dared so much as Pindar, and yet none was ever <lb/>
            instructed in the finest arts with greater care. It is sin­ <lb/>
            gular, that for much of his instruction he was indebted to <lb/>
            the female sex, at a time when women were excluded from <lb/>
            the higher departments of knowledge, and regarded as <lb/>
            scarcely endowed with intellectual faculties. According to <lb/>
            Suidas, he was first taught to combine simplicity with <lb/>
            elegance in the composition of his verses by Myrtis, t obably <lb/>
            his mother, who was herself the author of poems adapted to <note type="footnote"> b </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="X"/>
            the lyre. At a sub sequent period, the beautiful Corinna <lb/>
            became his instructor. Some assert that he enjoyed also <lb/>
            the singular advantage of being the pupil of Simonides, <lb/>
            though no styles of poetry can be more dissimilar than that <lb/>
            instinct with the ardent, impetuous, and daring spirit or <lb/>
            Pindar, and the soft, pensive, and mellow tenderness of his <lb/>
            reputed master. Not only poetry, but also the sifter art of <lb/>
            music was carefully studied by the bard. Athenæus informs <lb/>
            us, that Lasus of Hermione, an excellent musician and <lb/>
            dithyrambic poet, imparted to him his skill in playing on <lb/>
            the lyre. Certain it is that he was prepared by no common <lb/>
            attention for that high and glorious career in which lie left <lb/>
            every competitor behind him.</p>
          <p>Pindar seems to have been early received with great <lb/>
            honour by Alexander, son of Amyntas, at the court of <lb/>
            Macedon. He overcame his teacher Myrtis in a contest of <lb/>
            musical skill; but was no less than five times defeated by <lb/>
            Corinna in striving for the reward of poetry. It is in­ <lb/>
            timated, indeed, by some, that the judges were inclined to <lb/>
            favour the female candidate rather by the admiration of her <lb/>
            personal charms than of her poetical genius. Our bard <lb/>
            must, however, have been very young at this time, as <lb/>
            Diodorus Siculus asserts that he had only attained the age <lb/>
            of forty at the time of the battle of Salamis.</p>
          <p>In the public assemblies of Greece, Pindar no sooner <lb/>
            appeared than he attained a height of popular favour which <lb/>
            seems never to have left him; nor was his fame confined to <lb/>
            the people. As he sung the praises of the conquerors in <lb/>
            those games at which kings and princes strove for the prize, <lb/>
            he naturally acquired the favour and patronage of the great. <lb/>
            He enjoyed the favour of Hiero, king of Syracuse, whose <lb/>
            munificence he delighted to repay by immortal praise. His <lb/>
            partiality to the Athenians, however, drew on him the <lb/>
            resentment of his countrymen. Because he had celebrated <lb/>
             <pb n="XI"/>
            A-thens as the chief support of Greece they laid on him a' <lb/>
            heavy fine, on which the Athenians presented him with <lb/>
            a sum of double the amount. Authors are divided respecting <lb/>
            the time in which he died, some asserting that he only <lb/>
            reached the age of fifty-six, while others maintain that he <lb/>
            was eighty-six at the time of his decease. His departure <lb/>
            from life was gentle, for it took place while he was sitting <lb/>
            in a public assembly, and, till the spectators retired, he was <lb/>
            thought to be slumbering. As a prodigy is related of his <lb/>
            birth, so attempts were made by the Greeks to surround <lb/>
            his death by mystery. It is said, that having in one of his <lb/>
            poems represented Agamedes and Trophonius as rewarded <lb/>
            by sudden death for building the temple of Apollo, he was <lb/>
            referred by the priestess, on his inquiring what was best for <lb/>
            mankind, to his own verses. He understood this reply as <lb/>
            an intimation of approaching and sudden dissolution, which <lb/>
            soon after took place.</p>
          <p>Extraordinary honours were paid to Pindar, both during <lb/>
            his life and after his decease. His odes and religious <lb/>
            hymns were chanted in the temples of Greece before the <lb/>
            most crowded assemblies, and on the most solemn occasions. <lb/>
            The priestess of Apollo, at Delphi, declared that it was the <lb/>
            will of that divinity that Pindar should receive half of the <lb/>
            first-fruits annually offered at his shrine.</p>
          <p>The Athenians erected a statue of brass in honour of him, <lb/>
            representing him with a diadem and a lyre, and a book <lb/>
            folded on his knees, which was remaining at the time of <lb/>
            Pausanias ; and a portion of the sacrifices at the great <lb/>
            festivals of Greece was, for a long time, set apart for his <lb/>
            descendants.</p>
          <p>When the Lacedæmonians took Thebes, they spared the <lb/>
            house and family of Pindar ; and when, afterwards, the city <lb/>
            was taken by Alexander, the same mark of veneration was <lb/>
            shown to his memory. His works have been extolled in terms <note type="footnote"> b 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="XII"/>
            of the most a dent admiration by some of the first ancient <lb/>
            writers. Quinctilian says of him, in his Institutes, " Novem <lb/>
            Græcorum lyricorum Pindarus princeps, spiritu, magnifi­ <lb/>
            centiâ, sententiis, figuris ; beatissimus rerum verborumque <lb/>
            copia et velut quodam eloquentiæ flumine, propter quæ <lb/>
            Horatius nemini credit eum imitabilem."—Of the nine <lb/>
            Greek lyric poets, Pindar is the chief, in spirit, in magnifi­ <lb/>
            cence, in moral sentiments, and in metaphor; most happy <lb/>
            both in the abundance of his matter and of his diction; <lb/>
            and, as it were, with a certain torrent of eloquence, so that <lb/>
            Horace says no man can imitate him.</p>
          <p>We cannot sufficiently regret the loss of the compositions <lb/>
            which called forth these eulogies, because though, compared <lb/>
            with the works of many other renowned authors, a consider­ <lb/>
            able number of Pindar's odes have reached us, those which <lb/>
            survive are not the most interesting in their subjects, nor <lb/>
            probably the most felicitous in their execution. The works <lb/>
            of Pindar consisted of hymns and pæans in honour of the <lb/>
            gods; songs accompanied by dances, in honour of Apollo ; <lb/>
            'dithyrambic verses to Bacchus, and some minor effusions, <lb/>
            with the odes on the Olympic, Nemean, Isthmian, and <lb/>
            Pythian games. Of these latter forty-five remain, which, <lb/>
            with a few fragments, form the only materials on which we <lb/>
            can now form any opinion of the extent or peculiar character <lb/>
            of Pindar's genius.</p>
          <p>No subjects, at first sight, could seem more unfitted for <lb/>
            sublime poetry than those of the Pindaric remains ; but the <lb/>
            poet has, with characteristic impetuosity, overcome this <lb/>
            difficulty by the practice of abandoning the professed objects <lb/>
            of his panegyric, and bursting into celebrations of the heroes <lb/>
            „ of former days, the mighty exploits of demigods, and the <lb/>
            gorgeous fables of oldest time. In the transition he uses <lb/>
            little art, but seems to rely, as he safely might, on the change <lb/>
            being, in itself, most welcome. He is chiefly remarkable for <lb/>
            the gigantic boldness of his conceptions, and the daring <lb/>
             <pb n="XIII"/>
            sublimity of his metaphors, which stamp him the Æschylus <lb/>
            of lyric poetry. The flights of his imagination are not, <lb/>
            however, like those of the great tragedian, mingled with the <lb/>
            intensity of human passion, which, while they carry us <lb/>
            beyond ourselves, still come home to the heart. He has the <lb/>
            light without the heat; his splendours dazzle, but do not <lb/>
            warm us. There is little of human feeling in his works ; <lb/>
            they are little more than exhibitions which excite our sur­ <lb/>
            prise, but not our sympathy. His compositions have some­ <lb/>
            thing hard and stony about them-the sublimity and <lb/>
            nakedness of the rock. The sunshine glitters on the top, <lb/>
            but no foliage adorns the declivity. All the interest, such <lb/>
            as it is, arises from the earnestness of the poet himself, and the <lb/>
            intense ardour with which he is impelled in his lofty career. <lb/>
            Hence we think more of him than of his work; while in <lb/>
            Homer and the Greek tragedians the author is forgotten. <lb/>
            His conception is so ardent that he cannot wait to develop <lb/>
            his metaphors ; he often but half unfolds them, and suffers <lb/>
            them to blend with the literal descriptions, and form part of <lb/>
            the subject; and hence, it appears to us, the obscurities so <lb/>
            frequently complained of in Pindar have, in a great degree, <lb/>
            arisen. In the mechanical composition of his odes, however, <lb/>
            Pindar is by no means so irregular as some have been dis­ <lb/>
            posed to imagine. He commonly preserves the arrangement <lb/>
            of strophe, antistrophe, and epode ; and though the con­ <lb/>
            struction of these varies in different odes, all the strophes and <lb/>
            antistrophes in the same ode are framed on the same <lb/>
            principles, and all the epodes are composed in similar <lb/>
            measures to each other.</p>
          <p>The commencement of the first Pythian ode is imitated <lb/>
            in animated style by Gray, in his " Progress of Poesy — <lb/>
            Oh! sovereign of the willing soul, <lb/>
            Parent of sweet and solemn-breathing airs! <lb/>
            Enchanting shell! the sullen cares, <lb/>
            And frantic passions bear thy soft control. <lb/>

            On Thracia's hills the lord of war <lb/>

            part of this extract:- <lb/>
            With slackened wings, <lb/>
            While now the solemn concert breathes around, <lb/>
            Incumbent o'er the sceptre of his lord, <lb/>
            Sleeps the stern eagle ; by the numbered notes <lb/>
            Possessed ; and satiate with the melting tones, <lb/>
            Sovereign of birds. The furious god of war, <lb/>
            His darts forgetting, and the rapid wheels <lb/>
            That bear him vengeful o'er th' embattled plains, <lb/>
            Relents.</p>
          <p>In the second Olympic Ode, Pindar thus introduces us <lb/>
            into the Fortunate Islands, the Paradise of the ancients, and <lb/>
            paints with equal vividness and beauty the felicity of the <lb/>
            blessed. West, in his translation, seems to have caught <lb/>

          <p>THE only class of poems which enables us to judge of <lb/>
            Pindar's general style, are the epinikia or triumphal odes. <lb/>
            Pindar, indeed, excelled in all the known varieties of choral <lb/>
            poetry ; viz., hymns to the gods, paeans, and dithyrambs ap­ <lb/>
            propriate to the worship of particular divinities, odes for <lb/>
            processions (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πρωσόδια</foreign>), songs of maidens (<foreign xml:lang="grc">παρθένια</foreign>), mimic <lb/>
            dancing songs (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπορχήματα</foreign>), drinking songs (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σκολιὰ</foreign>); dirges, <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ϑρη̃νοι</foreign>), and encomiastic odes to princes (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐγκώμια</foreign>), which <lb/>
            last approached most nearly to the epinikia. The poems <lb/>
            of Pindar in these various styles were nearly as renowned <lb/>
            among the ancients as the triumphal odes; which is proved <lb/>
            by the numerous quotations of them. Horace, too, in enume­ <lb/>
            rating the different styles of Pindar's poetry, puts the dithy­ <lb/>
            rambs first, then the hymns, and afterwards the epinikia, <lb/>
            and the threnes. Nevertheless there must have been some <lb/>
            decided superiority in the epinikia, which caused them to <lb/>
            be more frequently transcribed in the later period of anti­ <lb/>
            quity, and thus rescued them from perishing with the rest of <lb/>
            the Greek lyric poetry. At any rate these odes, from the <lb/>
            vast variety of their subjects and style, and their refined and <lb/>
            elaborate structure,-some approaching to hymns and pæans, <lb/>
            others to scolia and hyporchemes,—serve to indemnify us for <lb/>
            the loss of the other sorts of lyric poetry.</p>
          <p>We will now explain, as precisely as possible, the occasion <lb/>
            of an epinikian ode, and the mode of its execution. A vic­ <lb/>
            tory has been gained in a contest at a festival, particularly <lb/>
            at one of the four great games most prized by the Greek <lb/>
            people, either by the speed of horses, the strength and dex­ <lb/>
             <pb n="XVII"/>
            tcrity of the human body, or by skill in music. Such a <lb/>
            victory as this, which shed a lustre not only on the victor <lb/>
            himself, but on his family, and even on his native city, de­ <lb/>
            manded a solemn celebration. This celebration might be <lb/>
            performed by the victor's friends on the spot where the vic­ <lb/>
            tory was gained; as for example, at Olympia, when in the <lb/>
            evening after the termination of the contests, by the light of <lb/>
            the moon, the whole sanctuary resounded with joyful songs <lb/>
            after the manner of the encomia. Or it might be deferred <lb/>
            until after the victor's solemn return to his native city, <lb/>
            where it was sometimes repeated, in following years, in com­ <lb/>
            memoration of his success. A celebration of this kind <lb/>
            always had a religious character, it often began with a pro­ <lb/>
            cession to an altar or temple, in the place of the games or <lb/>
            in the native city ; a sacrifice, followed by a banquet, was <lb/>
            then offered at the temple, or in the house of the victor ; <lb/>
            and the whole solemnity concluded with the merry and <lb/>
            boisterous revel called by the Greeks <foreign xml:lang="grc">κω̃μος</foreign>. At this sacred, <lb/>
            and, at the same time, joyous solemnity (a mingled character <lb/>
            frequent among the Greeks), appeared the chorus, trained by <lb/>
            the poet, or some other skilled person, for the purpose of <lb/>
            reciting the triumphal hymn, which was considered the <lb/>
            fairest ornament of the festival. It was during either the <lb/>
            procession or the banquet that the hymn was recited ; as it <lb/>
            was not properly a religious hymn which could be combined <lb/>
            with the sacrifice. The form of the poem must, to a certain <lb/>
            extent, have been determined by the occasion on which it <lb/>
            was to be recited. From expressions which occur in several <lb/>
            epinikian odes, it is probable that all odes consisting of <lb/>
            strophes without epodes, were sung during a procession to a <lb/>
            temple or to the house of the victor; although there are <lb/>
            others containing expressions denoting movement, and which <lb/>
            yet have epodes. It is possible that the epodes in the latter <lb/>
            odes may have been sung at certain intervals when the pro­ <lb/>
             <pb n="XVIII"/>
            cession was not advancing ; for an epode, according to the <lb/>
            statements of the ancients, always required that the chorus <lb/>
            should be at rest. But by far the greater number of the <lb/>
            odes of Pindar were sung at the Comus, at the jovial termi­ <lb/>
            nation of the feast; and hence Pindar himself more fre­ <lb/>
            quently names his odes from the Comus than from the victory.</p>
          <p>§ 4. The occasion of an epinikian ode,—a victory in the <lb/>
            sacred game—and its end-the ennobling of a solemnity <lb/>
            connected with the worship of the gods,-required that it <lb/>
            should be composed in a lofty and dignified style. But, on <lb/>
            the other hand, the boisterous mirth of the feast did not <lb/>
            admit the severity of the antique poetical style, like that of <lb/>
            the hymns and names ; it demanded a free and lively expres­ <lb/>
            sion of feeling, in harmony with the occasion of the festival, <lb/>
            and suggesting the noblest ideas connected with the victor. <lb/>
            Pindar, however, gives no detailed description of the victory <lb/>
            as that would have been only a repetition of the spectacle <lb/>
            which had already been beheld with enthusiasm by the as­ <lb/>
            sembled Greeks at Olympia or Pytho; nay, he often bestows <lb/>
            only a few words on the victory, recording its place and the <lb/>
            sort of contest in which it was won. Nevertheless he does <lb/>
            not (as many writers have supposed) treat the victory as a <lb/>
            merely secondary object, which he despatches quickly, in <lb/>
            order to pass on to subjects of greater interest. The victory, <lb/>
            in truth, is always the point on which the whole of the ode <lb/>
            turns ; only he regards it not simply as an incident, but as <lb/>
            connected with the whole life of the victor. Pindar esta­ <lb/>
            blishes this connection by forming a high conception of the <lb/>
            fortunes and character of the victor, and by representing the <lb/>
            victory as the result of them. And as the Greeks were less <lb/>
            accustomed to consider a man in his individual capacity, than <lb/>
            as a member of his state and his family, so Pindar considers <lb/>
            the renown of the victor in connection with the past and <lb/>
            present condition of the race and state to which he belongs <lb/>
             <pb n="XIX"/>
            Now there are two different points from which the poet <lb/>
            might view the life of the victor; viz., destiny or merit; in <lb/>
            other words, he might celebrate his good fortune or his skill. <lb/>
            In the victory with horses, external advantages were the <lb/>
            chief consideration, inasmuch as it required excellent horses <lb/>
            and an excellent driver, both of which were attainable only <lb/>
            by the rich. The skill of the victor was more conspicuous <lb/>
            in gymnastic feats, although even in these, good luck and the <lb/>
            favour of the gods might be considered as the main causes of <lb/>
            success; especially as it was a favourite opinion of Pindar's, <lb/>
            that all excellence is a gift of nature. The good fortune <lb/>
            or skill of the victor could not, however, be treated abstract­ <lb/>
            edly ; but must be individualized by a description of his <lb/>
            peculiar lot. This individual colouring might be given by <lb/>
            representing the good fortune of the victor as a compensation <lb/>
            for past ill fortune; or, generally, by describing the alterna­ <lb/>
            tions of fortune in his lot and in that of his family. Another <lb/>
            theme for an ode might be, that success in gymnastic contests <lb/>
            was obtained by a family in alternate generations, that is, by <lb/>
            the grandfathers and grandsons, but not by the intermediate <lb/>
            generation. If, however, the good fortune of the victor had <lb/>
            been invariable, congratulation at such rare happiness was <lb/>
            accompanied with moral reflections, especially on the right <lb/>
            manner of estimating or enduring good fortune, or on the <lb/>
            best mode of turning it to account. According to the notions <lb/>
            of the Greeks, an extraordinary share of the gifts of fortune <lb/>
            suggested a dread of the Nemesis, which delighted in hum­ <lb/>
            bling the pride of man ; and hence the warning to be prudent, <lb/>
            and not to strive after further victories. The admonitions <lb/>
            which Pindar addresses to Hiero are to cultivate a calm <lb/>
            serenity of mind after the cares and toils by which he had <lb/>
            founded and extended his empire, and to purify and ennoble <lb/>
            by poetry a spirit which had been ruffled by unworthy pas­ <lb/>
            sions. Even when the skill of the victor is put in the fore­ <lb/>
             <pb n="XX"/>
            ground, Pindar, in genera, does not content himself with cele­ <lb/>
            brating this bodily prowess alone, but he usually adds some <lb/>
            moral virtue which the victor has shown, Or which he recom­ <lb/>
            mends and extols. This virtue is sometimes moderation, <lb/>
            sometimes wisdom, sometimes filial love, sometimes piety to <lb/>
            the gods. The latter is frequently represented as the main <lb/>
            cause of the victory; the victor having thereby obtained the <lb/>
            protection of the deities who preside over gymnastic con­ <lb/>
            tests,-as Hermes or the Dioscuri. It is evident that, with <lb/>
            Pindar, this mode of accounting for success was not the mere <lb/>
            fiction of a poet; he sincerely thought that he had traced <lb/>
            the victory to the favour of a god who took an especial in­ <lb/>
            terest in the family of the victor, and at the same time <lb/>
            presided over the games. Generally, indeed, in extolling <lb/>
            both the skill and fortune of the victor, Pindar appears to <lb/>
            adhere to the truth as faithfully as he declares himself to do; <lb/>
            nor is he ever betrayed into a high-flown style of panegyric. <lb/>
            A republican dread of incurring the censure of his fellow- <lb/>
            citizens, as well as an awe of the divine Nemesis, induced him <lb/>
            to moderate his praises, and to keep in view the instability <lb/>
            of human fortune, and the narrow limits of human strength.</p>
          <p>Thus far the poet seems to wear the character of a sage <lb/>
            who expounds to the victor his destiny, by showing him the <lb/>
            dependence of his exploit upon a higher order of things. <lb/>
            Nevertheless, it is not to be supposed that the poet placed <lb/>
            himself on an eminence remote from ordinary life, and that <lb/>
            he spoke like a priest to the people unmoved by personal <lb/>
            feelings. The Epinikia of Pindar, although they were <lb/>
            delivered by a chorus, were, nevertheless, the expression of <lb/>
            his individual feelings and opinions, and are full of allusions <lb/>
            to his personal relations to the victor. Sometimes, indeed, <lb/>
            when his relations of this kind were peculiarly interesting to <lb/>
            him, he made them the main subject of the ode ; several of <lb/>
            his odes, and some among the most difficult, are to be <lb/>
             <pb n="XXI"/>
            explained in this manner. In one of his odes Pindar justifies <lb/>
            the sincerity of his poetry against the charges which had <lb/>
            been brought against it; and represents his muse as a just <lb/>
            and impartial dispenser of fame, as well among the victors <lb/>
            at the games, as among the heroes of antiquity. In another <lb/>
            he reminds the victor that he had predicted the victory to <lb/>
            him at the public games, and had encouraged him to become <lb/>
            a competitor for it; and he extols him for having employed <lb/>
            his wealth for so noble an object. In another he excuses <lb/>
            himself for having delayed the composition of an ode which <lb/>
            he had promised to a wrestler among the youths, until the <lb/>
            victor had attained his manhood; and as if to incite himself <lb/>
            to the fulfilment of his promise, he points out the hallowed <lb/>
            antiquity of these triumphal hymns, connecting their origin <lb/>
            with the first establishment of the Olympic games.</p>
          <p>§ 5. Whatever might be the theme of one of Pindar's <lb/>
            epinikian odes, it would naturally not be developed with <lb/>
            the systematic completeness of a philosophical treatise. Pin­ <lb/>
            dar, however, has undoubtedly much of that sententious <lb/>
            wisdom which began to show itself among the Greeks, at the <lb/>
            time of the seven wise men, and which formed an important <lb/>
            element of elegiac and choral lyric poetry before the time of <lb/>
            Pindar. The apophthegms of Pindar sometimes assume the <lb/>
            form of general maxims, and sometimes of direct admonitions <lb/>
            to the victor. At other times, when he wishes to impress <lb/>
            some principle of morality or prudence upon the victor, he <lb/>
            gives it in the form of an opinion entertained by himself: <lb/>
            " I like not to keep much riches hoarded in an inner room; <lb/>
            but I like to live well by my possessions, and to procure <lb/>
            myself a good name by making large gifts to my friends."</p>
          <p>The other element of Pindar's poetry, his mythical narra­ <lb/>
            tives, occupies, however, far more space in most of his odes. <lb/>
            That these are not mere digressions, for the sake of ornament, <lb/>
            has been completely proved by modern commentators. At <lb/>
             <pb n="XXII"/>
            the same time he would sometimes seem to wish it to be <lb/>
            believed, that he had been carried away by his poetical <lb/>
            fervour, when he returns to his theme from a long mythical <lb/>
            narration, or when he annexes a mythical story to a prover­ <lb/>
            bial saying; as, for example, when he subjoins to the figura­ <lb/>
            tive expression, " Neither by sea nor by land canst thou find <lb/>
            the way to the Hyperboreans," the history of Perseus' visit <lb/>
            to that fabulous people. But even in such cases as these, it <lb/>
            will be found, on close examination, that the fable belongs <lb/>
            to the subject. Indeed, it may be observed generally of <lb/>
            those Greek writers who aimed at the production of works <lb/>
            of art, whether in prose or in poetry, that they often conceal <lb/>
            their real purpose, and affect to leave in vague uncertainty <lb/>
            that which had been composed studiously and on a precon­ <lb/>
            ceived plan. Thus Plato often seems to allow the dialogue to <lb/>
            deviate into a wrong course, when this very course was <lb/>
            required by the investigation. In other passages Pindar <lb/>
            himself remarks that intelligence and reflection are required <lb/>
            to discover the hidden meaning of his mythical episodes. <lb/>
            Thus, after a description of the Islands of the Blessed, and <lb/>
            the heroes who dwell there, he says, " I have many swift <lb/>
            arrows in my quiver, which speak to the wise, but need an <lb/>
            interpreter for the multitude." Again, after the story of <lb/>
            Ixion, which he relates in an ode to Hiero, he continues,— <lb/>
            " I must, however, have a care lest I fall into the biting <lb/>
            violence of the evil speakers; for, though distant in time, <lb/>
            I have seen that the slanderous Archilochus, who fed upon <lb/>
            loud-tongued wrath, passed the greater part of his life in <lb/>
            difficulties and distress." It is not easy to understand in <lb/>
            this passage what moves the poet to express so much anxiety; <lb/>
            until we advert to the lessons which the history of Ixion <lb/>
            contains for the rapacious Hiero.</p>
          <p>The reference of these mythical narratives to the main <lb/>
            theme of the ode, may be either historical or ideal. In the <lb/>
             <pb n="XXIII"/>
            first case the mythical personages alluded to are the heroes <lb/>
            at the head of the family or state to which the victor belongs, <lb/>
            or the founders of the games in which he has conquered. <lb/>
            Among the many odes of Pindar to victors from Ægina, <lb/>
            there is none in which he does not extol the heroic race of <lb/>
            the Æacid. " It is," he says, " to me an invariable law, <lb/>
            when I turn towards this island, to scatter praise upon you, <lb/>
            O Æacids! masters of golden chariots !" In the second case <lb/>
            events of the heroic age are described, which resemble the <lb/>
            events of the victors life, or which contain lessons and <lb/>
            admonitions for him to reflect upon. Thus two mythical <lb/>
            personages may be introduced, of whom one may typify the <lb/>
            victor in his praiseworthy, the other in his blameable acts : <lb/>
            so that the one example may serve to deter, the other to <lb/>
            encourage. In general Pindar contrives to unite both these <lb/>
            modes of allusion, by representing the national or family <lb/>
            heroes as allied in character and spirit to the victor. Their <lb/>
            extraordinary strength and felicity are continued in their <lb/>
            descendants; the same mixture of good and evil destiny, <lb/>
            and even the same faults recur in their posterity. It is to <lb/>
            be observed, that, in Pindar's time, the faith of the Greeks <lb/>
            in the connection of the heroes of antiquity with passing <lb/>
            events was unshaken. The origin of historical events was <lb/>
            sought in a remote age; conquests and settlements in bar­ <lb/>
            barian countries were justified by corresponding enterprises <lb/>
            of heroes : the Persian war was looked upon as an act of the <lb/>
            same great drama of which the expedition of the Argonauts <lb/>
            and the Trojan war formed the earlier parts. At the same <lb/>
            time the mythical part was considered as invested with <lb/>
            a splendour and sublimity of which even a faint reflection <lb/>
            was sufficient to embellish the present. This is the cause of <lb/>
            the historical and political allusions of the Greek tragedy, <lb/>
            particularly in Æschylus. Even the history of Herodotus <lb/>
            rests on the same foundations; but it is seen most distinctly <lb/>
             <pb n="XXIV"/>
            in the copious mythology which Pindar has pressed into the <lb/>
            service of his lyric poetry. The manner in which mythical <lb/>
            subjects were treated by the lyric poets was, of course, <lb/>
            different from that in which they had been treated by the epic <lb/>
            poets. In epic poetry the mythical narrative is interesting <lb/>
            in itself, and all parts of it are developed with equal fulness. <lb/>
            In lyric poetry it serves to exemplify some particular idea, <lb/>
            which is stated usually in the middle or at the end of the <lb/>
            ode; and those points only of the story are brought into <lb/>
            relief, which serve to illustrate this idea. Accordingly, the <lb/>
            longest mythical narrative in Pindar (viz. the description of <lb/>
            the voyage of the Argonauts in the Pythian ode to Arcesi­ <lb/>
            laus, king of Cyrene, which is continued through twenty-five <lb/>
            strophes) falls far short of the sustained diffuseness of the <lb/>
            epos. Consistently with the purpose of this ode, it is intended <lb/>
            to set forth the descent of the kings of Cyrene from the <lb/>
            Argonauts, and the poet only dwells on the relation of Jason <lb/>
            with Pelias—of the noble exile with the jealous tyrant- <lb/>
            because it contains a serious admonition to Arcesilaus in his <lb/>
            above-mentioned relation with Damophilus.</p>
          <p>§ 6. The mixture of apophthegmatic maxims and typical <lb/>
            narratives would alone render it difficult to follow the thread <lb/>
            of Pindar's meaning; but, in addition to this cause of ob­ <lb/>
            scurity, the entire plan of his poetry is so intricate, that a <lb/>
            modern reader often fails to understand the connection of <lb/>
            the parts, even where he thinks he has found a clue. Pin­ <lb/>
            dar begins an ode full of the lofty conception which he has <lb/>
            formed of the glorious destiny of the victor; and he seems, <lb/>
            as it were, carried away by the flood of images which this <lb/>
            conception pours forth. He does not attempt to express <lb/>
            directly the general idea, but follows the train of thoughts <lb/>
            which it suggests into its details, though without losing <lb/>
            sight of their reference to the main object. Accordingly, <lb/>
            when he has pursued a train of thought, either in an <lb/>
             <pb n="XXV"/>
            apophthegmatic or mythical form, up to a certain point, he <lb/>
            breaks off before he has gone far enough to make the <lb/>
            application to the victor sufficiently clear; he then takes <lb/>
            up another thread, which, perhaps, is soon dropped for a <lb/>
            fresh one ; and at the end of the ode he gathers up all these <lb/>
            different threads, and weaves them together into one web, <lb/>
            in which the general idea predominates. By reserving the <lb/>
            explanation of his allusions until the end, Pindar contrives <lb/>
            that his odes should consist of parts which are not complete <lb/>
            or intelligible in themselves; and thus the curiosity of the <lb/>
            reader is kept on the stretch throughout the entire ode. <lb/>
            Thus, for example, the ode upon the Pythian victory which <lb/>
            was gained by Hiero, as a citizen of Ætna, a city founded <lb/>
            by himself proceeds upon the general idea of the repose <lb/>
            and serenity of mind which Hiero at last enjoys, after a <lb/>
            laborious life, and to which Pindar strives to contribute by <lb/>
            the influence of music and poetry. Full of this idea, Pindar <lb/>
            begins by describing the effects of music upon the gods in <lb/>
            Olympus, how it delights, inspires, and soothes them, <lb/>
            although it increases the anguish of Typhos, the enemy of <lb/>
            the gods, who lies bound under Ætna. Thence, by assudden <lb/>
            transition, he passes to the new town of Ætna, under the <lb/>
            mountain of the name; extols the happy auspices under <lb/>
            which it was founded; and lauds Hiero for his great deeds <lb/>
            in war, and for the wise constitution he has given to the <lb/>
            new state; to which Pindar wishes exemption from foreign <lb/>
            enemies and internal discord. Thus far it does not appear <lb/>
            how the praises of music are connected with the exploits of <lb/>
            Hiero as a warrior and a statesman. But the connection <lb/>
            becomes evident when Pindar addresses to Hiero a series of <lb/>
            moral sentences, the object of which is to advise him to <lb/>
            subdue all unworthy passions, to refresh his mind with the <lb/>
            contemplation of art, and thus to obtain from the poets a <lb/>
            good name which will descend to posterity <note type="footnote"> c </note> <pb n="XXVI"/>
             </p>
          <p>§ 7. The characteristics of Pindar's poetry, which have <lb/>
            been just explained, may be discerned in all his epinikian <lb/>
            odes. Their agreement, however, in this respect, is quite <lb/>
            consistent with the extraordinary variety of style and <lb/>
            expression which has been already stated to belong to this <lb/>
            class of poems. Every epinikian ode of Pindar has its <lb/>
            peculiar tone, depending upon the course of the ideas, and <lb/>
            the consequent choice of the expressions. The principal <lb/>
            differences are connected with the choice of the rhythms, <lb/>
            which again is regulated by the musical style. According <lb/>
            to the last distinction, the epinikia of Pindar are of three <lb/>
            sorts, Doric, Æolic, and Lydian; which can be easily dis­ <lb/>
            tinguished, although each admits of innumerable varieties. <lb/>
            In respect of metre, every ode of Pindar has an individual <lb/>
            character; no two odes having the same metrical structure. <lb/>
            In the Doric ode the same metrical forms occur as those <lb/>
            which prevailed in the choral lyric poetry of Stesichorus, <lb/>
            viz., systems of dactyls and trochaic dipodies, which most <lb/>
            nearly approach the stateliness of the hexameter. Accord­ <lb/>
            ingly, a serene dignity pervades these odes; the mythical <lb/>
            narrations are developed with greater fulness, and the ideas <lb/>
            are limited to the subject, and are free from personal feeling; <lb/>
            in short, their general character is that of calmness and <lb/>
            elevation. The language is epic, with a slight Doric tinge, <lb/>
            which adds to its brilliancy and dignity. The rhythms of the <lb/>
            Æolic odes resemble those of the Lesbian poetry, in which <lb/>
            light dactylic, trochaic, or logaoedic metres prevailed; these <lb/>
            rhythms, however, when applied to choral lyric poetry, were <lb/>
            rendered far more various, and thus often acquired a charac­ <lb/>
            ter of greater volubility and liveliness. The poet's mind <lb/>
            also moves with greater rapidity; and sometimes he stops <lb/>
            himself in the midst of narrations which seem to him <lb/>
            impious or arrogant. A larger scope is likewise given to his <lb/>
            personal feelings; and in the addresses to the victor there is <lb/>
             <pb n="XXVII"/>
            a gayer tone, which at times even takes a jocular turn. <lb/>
            The poet introduces his relations to the victor, and to his <lb/>
            poetical rivals; he extols his own style, and decries that of <lb/>
            others. The Æolic odes, from the rapidity and variety of <lb/>
            their movement, have a less uniform character than the <lb/>
            Doric odes; for example, the first Olympic, with its joyous <lb/>
            and glowing images, is very different from the second, in <lb/>
            which a lofty melancholy is expressed ; and from the ninth, <lb/>
            which has a proud and complacent self-reliance. The lan­ <lb/>
            guage of the Æolic epinikia is also bolder, more difficult in <lb/>
            its syntax, and marked by rarer dialectical forms. Lastly, <lb/>
            there are the Lydian odes, the number of which is incon­ <lb/>
            siderable : their metre is mustly trochaic, and of a particu­ <lb/>
            larly soft character, agreeing with the tone of the poetry. <lb/>
            Pindar appears to have preferred the Lydian rhythms for <lb/>
            odes which were destined to be sung during a procession to <lb/>
            a temple, or at the altar, and in which the favour of the <lb/>
            deity was implored in an humble spirit.</p><pb n="-"/>

          <p>THE Olympic Festival was a Pentaeteris (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πενταευηρίς</foreign>), that <lb/>
            in. according to the ancient mode of reckoning, a space of <lb/>
            four years elapsed between each festival, in the same way as <lb/>
            there was only a space of two years between a Trieteris. It <lb/>
            was celebrated on the first full moon after the summer sol­ <lb/>
            stice. It lasted, after all the contests had been introduced, <lb/>
            five days, fromthe 11th to the 15th days of the month <lb/>
            inclusive. The fourth day of the festival was the 14th of <lb/>
            the month, which was the day of the full moon, and which <lb/>
            divided the month into two equal parts.</p>
          <p>The festival was under the immediate superintendence of <lb/>
            the Olympian Zeus, whose temple at Olympia, adorned with <lb/>
            the statue of the god made by Phidias, was one of the most <lb/>
            splendid works of art in Greece. There were also temples <lb/>
            and altars to other gods. The festival itself may be divided <lb/>
            into two parts-the games or contests (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγὼν 'Ολυμπιακός</foreign>), <lb/>
            and the festive rites (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑορτή</foreign>); connected with the sacrifices, <lb/>
            with the processions, and with the public banquets in honour <lb/>
            of the conquerors.</p>
          <p>The contests consisted of various trials of strength and <lb/>
            skill, which were increased in number from time to time. <lb/>
            There were in all twenty-four contests, eighteen in which <lb/>
            men took part, and six in which boys engaged, though they <note type="footnote"> B 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="4"/>
            were never all exhibited at one festival, since some were <lb/>
            abolished almost immediately after their institution, and <lb/>
            others after they had been in use only a short time. We <lb/>
            subjoin a list of these from Pausanias, with the date of <lb/>
            introduction of each, commencing from the Olympiad of <lb/>
            Coræbus :—1st. The foot-race (<foreign xml:lang="grc">δρόμος</foreign>), which was the only <lb/>
            contest during the first 13 Olympiads. 2nd. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίαυλος</foreign>, <lb/>
            or foot-race, in which the stadium was traversed twice, first <lb/>
            introduced in Olympiad 14. 3rd. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">δόλιχος</foreign>, a still longer <lb/>
            foot-race than the <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίαυλος</foreign>, introduced in Olympiad 15. 4th. <lb/>
            Wrestling (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πάλη</foreign>); and 5th. The Pentathlum (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πένταθλον</foreign>), <lb/>
            which consisted of five exercises, viz. leaping, the foot-race, <lb/>
            the throwing the discus, the throwing the spear, and <lb/>
            wrestling; both introduced in Olympiad 18. 6th. Boxing <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πυγμή</foreign>), introduced in Olympiad 23. 7th. The chariot-race, <lb/>
            with four full-grown horses (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἵππων τελείων δρόμος, ἅρμα</foreign>), <lb/>
            introduced in Olympiad 25. 8th. The Pancratium (<foreign xml:lang="grc">παγκρά­ <lb/>
            ιον</foreign>), consisting of boxing and wrestling; and 9th. The <lb/>
            horse-race (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἵππος κέλης</foreign>), both introduced in Olympiad 33. <lb/>
            10th and 11th. The foot-race and wrestling for boys, intro­ <lb/>
            duced in Olympiad 37. 12th. The Pentathlum for boys, <lb/>
            introduced in Olympiad 38, but immediately afterwards <lb/>
            abolished. 13th. Boxing for boys, introduced in Olym <lb/>
            piad 41. 14th. The foot-race, in which men ran with the <lb/>
            equipments of heavy-armed soldiers (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τω̃νὁπλιτω̃ν δρόμος</foreign>), <lb/>
            introduced in Olympiad 65, on account of its training <lb/>
            men for actual service in war. 15th. The chariot-race <lb/>
            -with mules (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπήνη</foreign>), introduced in Olympiad 70; and <lb/>
            16th. The horse-race with mares (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κάλπη</foreign>), introduced in <lb/>
            Olympiad 71 ; both of which were abolished in Olympiad 84. <lb/>
            17th. The chariot-race with two full-grown horses (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἵππων <lb/>
            τελείων συνωρίς</foreign>), introduced in Olympiad 93. 18th and 19th. <lb/>
            The contests of heralds (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κήρυκες</foreign>) and trumpeters (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σαλπιγκταί</foreign>), <lb/>
            introduced in Olympiad 96. 20th. The chariot-race with <lb/>
             <pb n="5"/>
            four foals (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πώλων ἅρμασιν</foreign>), introduced in Olympiad 99. <lb/>
            21st. The chariot-race with two foals (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πώλων συνωρίς</foreign>), intro­ <lb/>
            duced in Olympiad 128. 22nd. The horse-race with foals <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πώλος κέλης</foreign>), introduced in Olympiad 131. 23rd. The <lb/>
            Pancratium for boys, introduced in Olympiad 145. 24th. <lb/>
            There was also a horse-race (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἵππος κέλης</foreign>), in which boys <lb/>
            rode, but we do not know the time of its introduction.</p>
          <p>The judges in the Olympic Games, called Hellanodicæ <lb/>
            ('<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ελλανοδίκαι</foreign>), were appointed by the Eleans, who had the <lb/>
            regulation of the whole festival. It appears to have been <lb/>
            originally under the superintendence of Pisa, in the neigh­ <lb/>
            bourhood of which Olympia was situated; but after the <lb/>
            conquest of Peloponnesus by the Dorians, on the return of <lb/>
            the Heraclidæ, the Ætolians, who had been of great assist­ <lb/>
            ance to the Heraclidæ, settled in Elis, and from this time <lb/>
            the Ætolian Eleans obtained the regulation of the festival, <lb/>
            and appointed the presiding officers.</p>
          <p>The Hellanodicæ were chosen by lot from the whole body <lb/>
            of the Eleans. Their number varied at different periods, but <lb/>
            at a later time there were eight Hellanodicæ. The office, <lb/>
            probably, lasted for only one festival. They had to see that <lb/>
            all the laws relating to the games were observed by the <lb/>
            competitors and others, to determine the prizes and to give <lb/>
            them to the conquerors. An appeal lay from their decision <lb/>
            to the Elean senate. Under the direction of the Hel­ <lb/>
            lanodicæ were a certain number of Alytæ (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλύται</foreign>), with an <lb/>
            Alytarches (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλυτάρχης</foreign>) at their head, who formed a kind <lb/>
            of police, and carried into execution the commands of the <lb/>
            Hellanodicæ. There were also various other minor officers <lb/>
            under the control of the Hellanodicæ.</p>
          <p>All free Greeks were allowed to contend in the games, <lb/>
            who had complied with the rules prescribed to candidates. <lb/>
            The equestrian contests were necessarily confined to the <lb/>
            wealthy; but the poorest citizens could contend in the <lb/>
             <pb n="6"/>
            athletic games. This, however, was far from degrading the <lb/>
            games in public opinion; and some of the noblest as well <lb/>
            as meanest citizens of the state took part in these contests. <lb/>
            The owners of the chariots and horses were not obliged to <lb/>
            contend in <unclear>pe</unclear> ; and the wealthy vied with one another <lb/>
            in the number and magnificence of the chariots and horses <lb/>
            which they sent to the games.</p>
          <p>All persons who were about to contend, had to prove to <lb/>
            the Hellanodicæ that they were freemen, and of pure Hel­ <lb/>
            lenic blood; that they had not been branded with atimia, <lb/>
            nor guilty of any sacrilegious act. They further had to <lb/>
            prove that they had undergone the preparatory training <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πργυμνάσματα</foreign>) for ten months previously. All competitors <lb/>
            were obliged, thirty days before the festival, to undergo <lb/>
            certain exercises in the Gymnasium, at Elis, under the super­ <lb/>
            intendence of the Hellanodicæ. The competitors took their <lb/>
            places by lot. The herald then proclaimed the name and <lb/>
            country of each competitor. When they were all ready to <lb/>
            begin the contest, the judges exhorted them to acquit them­ <lb/>
            selves nobly, and then gave the signal to commence. The <lb/>
            only prize given to the conqueror was a garland of wild <lb/>
            olive (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κότιος</foreign>), cut from a sacred olive-tree, which grew in the <lb/>
            sacred grove of Altis, in Olympia. The victor was originally <lb/>
            crowned upon a tripod covered over with bronze, but after­ <lb/>
            wards upon a table made of ivory and gold. Palm branches. <lb/>
            the common tokens of victory on other occasions, were placed <lb/>
            in his hands. The name of the victor, and that of his father <lb/>
            and of his country, were then proclaimed by a herald before <lb/>
            the representatives of assembled Greece. The festival ended <lb/>
            with processions and sacrifices, and with a public banquet <lb/>
            given by the Eleans to the conquerors in the Prytaneium.</p>
          <p>The most powerful states considered an Olympic victory, <lb/>
            gained by one of their citizens, to confer honour upon the <lb/>
            state to whic' he belonged ; and a conqueroi usually had <lb/>
             <pb n="7"/>
            humanities and privileges conferred upon him by the grati­ <lb/>
            tude of his fellow citizens. On his return home the victor <lb/>
            entered the city in a triumphal procession, in which his <lb/>
            praises were celebrated, frequently in the loftiest strains of <lb/>
            poetry.</p>

          <p>The Olympic games were celebrated once in four years. <lb/>
            They lasted for five days, and terminated on the full moon <lb/>
            which succeeded the summer solstice. Contrasted with the <lb/>
            particular eras which served for the chronological arrange­ <lb/>
            ment of events in distinct provinces of Greece, the epoch <lb/>
            supplied by their celebration to all the inhabitants of the <lb/>
            Hellenic soil deserves peculiar attention. While the suc­ <lb/>
            cession of Priestesses of Juno at Argos, while the Ephors at <lb/>
            Sparta, and the Archons at Athens, furnished to those states <lb/>
            respectively the basis of their chronological systems ; it was <lb/>
            not a personage invested with a civil or sacerdotal character, <lb/>
            who gave his name, not merely to the single years, but to <lb/>
            the quadrennial periods of the whole of Greece; it was he <lb/>
            who was proclaimed victor, not in the chariot race of the <lb/>
            Hippodrome, but as having outrun his rivals in the stadium <lb/>
            at Olympia. A reflection on the rapid course of time <lb/>
            (the great racer in the stadium of the world) might well be <lb/>
            suggested by such a practice; but it is more remarkable, as <lb/>
            illustrating the regard paid, by the unanimous consent of all <lb/>
            the states of Greece, to those exercises of physical force, <lb/>
            which preserved them so long from the corruptions of luxury <lb/>
            and effeminacy, into which, through their growing opulence <lb/>
            and familiarity with oriental habits, they would very soon <lb/>
            otherwise have fallen.</p>
          <p>Olympia was the Palæstra of all Greece. The simplicity <lb/>
            of the prizes, the antiquity of their institution, the sacred <lb/>
             <pb n="8"/>
            ceremonies with which they were conducted ; the glory <lb/>
            which attached not merely to the victor, but to his parents. <lb/>
            his friends, and country; his canonization in the Greek <lb/>
            calendar; the concourse of rival tribes from every quarter of <lb/>
            the Greek continent and peninsula to behold the contests <lb/>
            and to applaud the conqueror ; the lyric songs of poets ; the <lb/>
            garlands showered upon his head by the hands of friends, of <lb/>
            strangers, and of Greece herself; the statue erected to him <lb/>
            in the precincts of the consecrated grove, by the side of <lb/>
            princes, of heroes, and of gods; the very rareness of the <lb/>
            celebration, and the glories of the season of the year at which <lb/>
            it took place, when all the charms of summer were poured <lb/>
            upon the earth by day, and the full orb of the moon streamed <lb/>
            upon the olive groves, and the broad flood of the Alpheius <lb/>
            by night; these were influences which, while they seemed to <lb/>
            raise the individual to an elevation more than human, pro­ <lb/>
            duced a far more noble and useful result than this,-that of <lb/>
            maintaining in the nation a general respect for a manly and <lb/>
            intrepid character, and of supporting that moral dignity and <lb/>
            independence, which so long resisted the aggressions of force <lb/>
            from without, and were proof against the contagion of weak <lb/>
            and licentious principles within.</p><pb n="9"/>

          <p>1 —17 : Proemium. The poet prepares a hymn in honour of king Hiero, <lb/>
            for his victory in the Olympic games. 17—100 : Digression from the <lb/>
            mention of Olympia to the fable of Pelops, and the tale of Tantalus’s <lb/>
            crime and its punishment. 100—end : Return to the praise of Hiero ; <lb/>

          <p>BEST of all things is water, and gold shines far above all <lb/>
            haughty wealth as blazing fire shines in the night; but if thou <lb/>
            wishest to tell of victories, my heart, seek no bright star <lb/>
            during the day, in the desert air, more genial than the sun; <lb/>
            nor can we sing of a contest higher in rank than Olympia's, <lb/>
            whence the renowned hymn has power over the minds of the <lb/>
            wise, so that they sing the Son of Cronos, coming to the <lb/>
            blest wealthy dwelling of Hiero—who wields the righteous <lb/>
            sceptre in Sicily rich in sheep, plucking the highest of all <lb/>
            virtues ;a and he is adorned also with the flower of music, <lb/>
            in such strains as we poets round the hospitable table often <lb/>
            sing.</p>
          <p>But from the peg take down the Dorian lyre, if at all the <lb/>
            glory of Pisa and Pherenicus hath subjected thy mind to the <lb/>
            influence of sweetest thoughts, when by the Alpheus he <lb/>
            rushed, displaying in the course a body ungoaded, and <lb/>
            blended with victory his lord, the Syracusian monarch re­ <lb/>

            Grace, that procureth all the sweets for mortals, bestowing <lb/>
            authority bath brought about that the incredible should <lb/>
            often come to be believed; but after-days are the best con­ <lb/>
            vincers.</p>
          <p>Now it is becoming to a man to speak what is good con­ <lb/>
            cerning the deities, for so is blame the less. 0 son of Tan­ <lb/>
            talus, I will record thy story, not as men of yore have done, <lb/>
            how when thy sire invited the gods to that most holy ban­ <lb/>
            quet, and to friendly Sipylus, offering a return of feasts to <lb/>
            the gods, then that he of the bright trident seized thee, and, <lb/>
            tamed in his soul by love, bore thee away on his gold-decked <lb/>
            steeds to the palace of Zeus the far-honoured, where in after­ <lb/>
            time came Ganymede to the same office.</p>
          <p>But when thou hadst vanished, nor did the men, after <lb/>
            much search, bring thee to thy mother, forthwith did some <lb/>
            one of the envious neighbours say that the gods had cut thee <lb/>
            limb by limb intod the strength of water boiling with fire, <lb/>
            and on the tables around they distributed among themselves <lb/>
            the sodden morsels of thy flesh, and ate. But to me it is <lb/>
            impossible to call any of the blessed ones a glutton; I stand <lb/>
            aloof from such a thought. Losse often befalls the slander­ <lb/>
            ous. But, yet, if the guardians of Olympus honoured any <lb/>
            mortal man, it was this Tantalus; but he could not bear <lb/>
            meekly great prosperity; but through pride and surfeit <lb/>
            drew upon himself immense calamity, which the Father hung <lb/>
            over him, a mighty stone for him, which ever eagerly desiring <lb/>
            to remove from his head, he is a stranger to happiness. This <lb/>
            helpless constantly-wretched life he has, a fourth affliction <lb/>
            with three others, because that having stolen the nectar and <lb/>
            ambrosia of the immortals with which they had made him <lb/>
            imperishable, he gave it to his comrade boon companions; <lb/>
            but if any one expects to escape the notice of the Deity in <lb/>
            doing aught, he errs. Therefore the immortals sent back his <lb/>
            son again to the short-lived race of men. But when, about <lb/>
            the time of blooming youth, down began to shade his chin so <lb/>
            as to make it dark, he meditated to obtain in contest the <lb/>
            proffered marriage, the renowned Hippodameia, from her <note type="footnote"> c v. 28 : i. e. deceive mortal!! so that reports are falsified. </note><note type="footnote"> d v. 43 : or, over.. e v. 53 : or, small gain. </note> <lb/>

            Plan sire. And having approached near the hoary sea alone <lb/>
            in the night, he called upon the deep-sounding lord of the <lb/>
            goodly trident, and he straightway appeared to him close at <lb/>
            hand.</p>
          <p>To whom, then, he spake, “If, 0 Poseidon, the pleasing <lb/>
            gifts of Cypria at all contribute to thy pleasure, impede the <lb/>
            brazen spear of Œnomaus, and me in swiftest chariot speed <lb/>
            oil to Elis, and bring me near to victory. Since having <lb/>
            destroyed thirteen hero-suitors he defers the marriage of bia <lb/>
            daughter; but great danger admits not a cowardly man. <lb/>
            But one of those who needs must die, why should he sitting <lb/>
            at his ease in obscurity in vain cherish without a name his <lb/>
            old age, deprived of all praise ? But to me this combat shall <lb/>
            be submitted, and do thou grant a favourable issue." Thus <lb/>
            he spoke, nor did he apply himself to fruitless prayers ; and <lb/>
            him the god honoured, and gave him a golden car, and steeds <lb/>
            unwearied with their wings.f And he conquered the might <lb/>
            of Œnomaus, and won the maiden consort, and begat six <lb/>
            lordly sons dear to the virtues. But now he is mingled <lb/>
            withg splendid offerings of blood, lying by the stream of <lb/>
            the Alpheus, holding a much-frequented tomb near the altar <lb/>
            thronged by strangers.</p>
          <p>But the glory shines afar of the Olympic games in the <lb/>
            race-courses of Pelops, where swiftness of feet contends, and <lb/>
            the height of strength stout at work ; and he who wins hath <lb/>
            for the remainder of his life delightful calm, as far as his <lb/>
            contests for the prize can give it.h</p>
          <p>But the good that ever cometh day by day cometh best to <lb/>
            every mortal. But it is my duty to crown him with an <lb/>
            equestrian lay in the Æolian measure , for I feel assured that <lb/>

            Laius, and slew him, and fulfilled the response uttered long <lb/>
            ago in Pytho. And keen-eyed Erinnys, having beheld the <lb/>
            crime, destroyed his warlike race with mutual slaughter; but <lb/>
            Thersander was left to Polynices at his fall, honoured in <lb/>
            youthful contests and in battles of war, a scion to support <lb/>
            the house of the Adrastidæ, whence theye derive the origin <lb/>
            of their race.</p>
          <p>It is befitting that the son of Ænesidamus should obtain <lb/>
            the praises of song and of lyre. For at Olympia he himself <lb/>
            received the gift of honour,f and in Pytho and the Isthmus <lb/>

            brother wreaths won by the four-horse cars, twelve times <lb/>
            running the course. But success frees from cares him that <lb/>

            phitryon brought from the shady fountains of Ister, fairest <lb/>

            (Heracles) had instituted the upright decision of mighty <lb/>

            craggy banks of Alpheus.</p>
          <p>But the district of Cronian Pelops did not yet grow fair <lb/>
            trees in its glens : bare of these, the sweet spot seemed to <lb/>
            him to be subject tog the sharp rays of the sun. So then his <lb/>

            which, in former time, Adrastus in justice openly pronounced <lb/>
            upon the seer Amphiaraus, the son of Oecleus, when earth <lb/>
            had seized upon g both him and his white steeds. Then after <lb/>
            the dead bodies of seven funeral pyres had been consumed, <lb/>
            the son of Talaus spoke, near Thebes, some such speech as <lb/>
            this : " I lament the eye of my army, both a good seer, and <lb/>
            good too to fight with the lance." This too belongs to the <lb/>
            Syracusian hero, the lord of the revel. Though neither con­ <lb/>
            tentious nor fond of strife, and having sworn a mighty oath, <lb/>
            I will yet clearly testify to this for his sake ; and the muses <lb/>
            with dulcet strain will permit me to do so.</p>
          <p>Come, 0 Phintis, yoke for me now the strength of mules, <lb/>
            with all speed, that in the illustrious h path of poetry we may <lb/>
            make the car to go, and I may arrive even at the origin i of <lb/>
            these heroes : for they,j beyond all others, know to lead this <lb/>
            road, since they won the wreaths in Olympia : therefore to <lb/>

            Pitana,k who verily, after intercourse with Poseidon, son of <lb/>
            Cronus, is said to have borne a dark-haired child, Evadne. <lb/>
            But she concealed the unborn child, conceived not in wed­ <lb/>
            lock, by the folds of her garment ;l and on the appointed <lb/>
            month, sending her attendants, she bade them give the child <lb/>
            to take care of to the hero the son of Elatus, who ruled the <lb/>
            Arcadians in Phcesana, and had his lot to dwell on the <lb/>
            Alpheus : there reared, she first tasted the sweets of love in <lb/>

          <p>But she did not for her full time escape the eye of <lb/>

            inquire of the oracle concerning this intolerable calamity. <lb/>
            Meantime she (Evadne). laying aside her girdle woven with <lb/>
            purple woof, and silver ewer, under dark bushes brought <lb/>
            forth a boy instinct with divinity. To her the deity of the <lb/>
            golden locksn sent to assist her gentle Ilithyia and the Fates ; <lb/>
            and from her womb, and from the yearning pang of child- <lb/>
            birth, came forth Iamus to light at once :° him, distracted <lb/>
            with grief, she left upon the ground ; and by the decrees of <lb/>
            the deities, two bright-eyed serpents caring for him,P nourished <lb/>
            him with the harmless poison of bees.</p>
          <p>But the king, when he arrived, driving his car from stony <lb/>
            Pytho, inquired of all in his house who might be the child <lb/>
            . that Evadne had borne; for he asserted that he was born <lb/>
            with Phœbus for his sire, and that he would be to the <lb/>
            dwellers upon earth a seer superior above all mortals, nor <lb/>
            that ever would his race fail. Thus, indeed, did he declare; <lb/>
            but they then avouched not to have seen or heard him, now <lb/>
            five days born. But he lay hid among the rushes and in <lb/>
            impervious brakes, covered thickly, as to his delicate body, <lb/>
            with the yellow and empurpled rays of the wall-flower; <lb/>
            wherefore she uttered the propitious word q that he should be <lb/>
            for ever called by this undying name.</p>
          <p>He, when he had received the fruit of golden-crowned <lb/>
            youth, descending by night into the midst of the Alpheus, <lb/>
            under the open sky, called upon Poseidon the widoly­ <lb/>
            mighty, his ancestor, and the bow-bearing guardian of <lb/>
            heaven-founded Delos, asking for himself some officer useful <lb/>
            to the people.8 And the sure paternal voice answered him, <lb/>
            and addressed him ; t " Arise, my child, come hither, to go u <lb/>
            to the land common to all, following my voice."</p>
          <p>Then they came to the steep rock of lofty Cronus : there <lb/>
            the god granted him a double treasure of divination ; <lb/>
            first to hear the voice that knows not falsehood, and <lb/>
            next when daring Heracles, noble offspring of the AEacidae, <lb/>

            (Iamus) to establish an oraclev on the upper part of the <lb/>
            altar of Zeus. From which time, much renowned through­ <lb/>

          <p>The ancient legends also of men say, that when Zeus and <lb/>
            che immortals were portioning out the earth, not as yet was <lb/>
            Rhodes to be seen in the ocean flood, but that the island lay <lb/>
            hid in the briny depths : nor of Helios, who was absent, did <lb/>
            any one point out the share ;P and so they left him without a <lb/>
            portion of land, him, the pure god. And for him, when he <lb/>
            (Helios) had reminded him, Zeus was again about to cast the <lb/>
            lot ; but he q allowed him not; since he said he saw within <lb/>
            the hoary sea a land rising from the bottom, full of nourish­ <lb/>
            ment for men and kindly for flocks. And forthwith he bade <lb/>
            golden-tired Lachesis uprear her hands to heaven,r and not to <lb/>
            utter insincerely the mighty oath of the gods, but with the <lb/>
            son of Cronus to grant that it,, when raised to the bright air, <lb/>
            should hereafter be a possession to himself ; and the sum of <lb/>
            his words found their accomplishment, turning out. true. <lb/>
            From the watery sea sprang forth the island, and the genial <lb/>
            father of the sharp rays of light is lord thereof, he, the com­ <lb/>
            mander of the fire-breathing steeds.</p>
          <p>There with Rhodes having intercourse of yore, he begot <lb/>
            seven sons, who, in the time of the former race of men, were <lb/>
            endowed with subtlest skill; of these one begot Cameirus <lb/>
            and Ialysus, the eldest of his children, and Lindus; and they <lb/>
            ruled separately each his portion of the cities,t having divided <lb/>
            into three parts the land of their sire ; and their seats were <lb/>
            called by their names. There (in Rhodes) a sweet atonement u <lb/>

            now made Alcimedon, thy brother, victorious at Olympia <lb/>
            near the hill of Cronus. And he was fair to behold, and, in <lb/>

            diversified and which inclines in various ways, to judge <lb/>
            with upright mind and fairly is a hard task;a but some law <lb/>
            of the immortals has placed this sea-girt country toob as a <lb/>

            clime (and may future time ne'er be weary of so doing !), this <lb/>

          <p>Æacus, whom the son of Latona and wide-ruling Poseidon, <lb/>
            when about to construct a circling bulwark for Ilium, called <lb/>
            in as their fellow-workman at the wall, because it was fated <lb/>
            that if should outbreathe smoke, in the city-wasting battles, <lb/>
            when wars arose. And silvery snakes,d leaping, three in <lb/>
            number, to the wall, as soon as it had just been built, two of <lb/>
            them fell down, and there on the spot bewildered resigned <lb/>
            their breath ; but one, with a cry of triumph, sprang in ; and <lb/>
            Apollo, pondering in his mind the prodigy, spake at once <lb/>
            before them.</p>
          <p>" Pergamus, where thy hands, 0 hero, have wrought, is to <lb/>

            Zeus' behest suddenly received an ebb. From them were <lb/>

            sons of the powerful Cronidæ, native kings ever.</p>
          <p>In time past, the Lord of Olympus having carried off the <lb/>
            daughter of Opus from the land of the Epeans, in quiet had <lb/>
            intercourse with her on the Mænalian hills, and brought her <lb/>
            to Locrus, lest the course of time, bringing upon him n a death <lb/>
            reft of offspring, should carry him off. But his spouse bore <lb/>
            the mighty seed, and the hero was gladdened on seeing his <lb/>
            adopted son, and called him so that he should bear the same <lb/>
            name as his maternal grandsire, him I say, a hero beyond de­ <lb/>
            scription great, both in beauty of form and in valiant deeds. <lb/>
            And he gave him a city and a people to govern : and <lb/>
            strangers flocked to him both from Argos and from Thebes, <lb/>
            the Arcadians too, and the men of Pisa.</p>
          <p>But the son of Actor and Ægina, Menœtius, of the new­ <lb/>
            comers did he especially honour. Menœtius, whose son, along <lb/>
            with the Atreidæ, having come to the plain of Teuthras, <lb/>
            stood with Achilles alone, at that time when, having turned <lb/>
            the warlike Greeks to flight, Telephus attacked their sea- <lb/>
            beaten sterns, so as to show to thoseo of understanding the <lb/>
            fierce spirit of Patroclus, so that they should know it. <lb/>
            Whereforep the offspring of Thetis exhorted him never to be <lb/>
            ranged in deadly battle apart from his man-slaying spear.</p>
          <p>Would that I were inventive in poetry, and worthy to <lb/>
            advance in the Muses' car, and might boldness and great <lb/>

            turning art which never fell, he passed through the ring of <lb/>
            spectators, with what applause! in the prime of life, and <lb/>
            fair, and having done the fairest deeds. On another occasion <lb/>
            was he seen, an object of marvel to the Parrhasian crowd, at <lb/>
            the time of the solemn assembly of Lycæan Zeus ; and again, <lb/>
            when he bore off, at Pellene, the warm cure of wintry <lb/>
            breezes :8 the tomb, likewise, of Iolaus, is a supporter of his <lb/>

          <p>Whatever comes by nature is best: yet many among men <lb/>
            have sought to gain glory by virtues acquired through in­ <lb/>
            struction. But when performed without the deity, each deed <lb/>
            becomes none the worse when passed over in silence. For <lb/>
            there are some paths that lead further than others, nor will <lb/>
            one single pursuit lead us all to honour. Excellences of <lb/>

            with your betters it is impossible to get rid of ;j wherefore <lb/>
            lie too did not avoid sudden death, having at the last through <lb/>
            his folly run in the way of capture.</p>
          <p>The valiant son of Zeus, then, having gathered in Pisa his <lb/>
            whole army and all his spoil, measured out the hallowed <lb/>
            lawn for his mightiest sire ; and, when he had made a fence <lb/>
            all around, he marked out in an open space the Altis, and he <lb/>
            appointed the plain round about as a place for banqueting, <lb/>
            and honoured the stream of the Alpheus in conjunction with <lb/>
            the twelve kingly gods ;k and he called the hill Cronus; for <lb/>
            in former times, untitled, whilst Œnomaus reigned, it was <lb/>
            covered with much snow.1 And in this initial festival,m <lb/>
            the Fates then stood by near at hand, and Time that <lb/>
            alone declareth genuine truth. And he,n advancing on­ <lb/>
            wards, has demonstrated the plain truth, how that, when <lb/>
            he had divided them to the twelve gods, he sacrificed <lb/>
            the gifts of way, the first-fruits; and how that nexto he <lb/>
            established the quinquennial festival simultaneously with <lb/>
            the first Olympian sacrifice, and the games in honour of his <lb/>
            victory.</p>

            I will make knowna the wealthy Corinth, the vestibule <lb/>
            of Isthmian Poseidon, rich in fair youths. For in her <lb/>
            Eunomia (Good order) dwells, and her sisters, the firm <lb/>
            pedestalb of cities, Justice and concordant Peace, dispensers of <lb/>

          <p>Fair things have I to say, and straightforward confidence <lb/>
            prompts my tongue to speak: and it is impossible to hide <lb/>
            our native genius.</p>

            flowers, oft shed the triumphal glory of those who surpassed <lb/>
            in the sacred games by their supreme excellence, and often <lb/>
            in the hearts of men have they implanted quaint inventions ; <lb/>
            but the glory of everythingc belongs to the inventor. <lb/>

            night; and he leapt upright on his feet, and, seizing the <lb/>
            wonder that lay near him,u he gladly sought the prophet of <lb/>
            the land, and showed to the son of Cœranus the accomplish­ <lb/>
            ment of the whole matter; how that he, at his bidding,v at <lb/>
            the altar of the goddess, reposed during the night, and how <lb/>
            that the daughter of Zeus, whose lance is the thunderbolt, <lb/>

          <p>The prophet bade him forthwith obey the bidding of the <lb/>

          <p>PYTHIAN games (<foreign xml:lang="grc">Πύθια</foreign>), one of the four great national <lb/>
            festivals of the Greeks. It was celebrated in the neighbour­ <lb/>
            hood of Delphi, anciently called Pytho, in honour of Apollo, <lb/>
            Artemis, and Leto. The place of this solemnity was the <lb/>
            Crisscean plain, which for this purpose contained a hippo­ <lb/>
            dromus, or race-course, a stadium of 1,000 feet in length. <lb/>
            and a theatre in which the musical contests took place A <lb/>
            gymnasium, prytaneum, and other buildings of this kind, <lb/>
            probably existed here, as at Olympia, although they are not <lb/>
            mentioned. Once the Pythian games were held at Athens <lb/>
            on the advice of Demetrius Poliorcetes, because Ætolians were <lb/>
            in possession of the passes around Delphi.</p>
          <p>The Pythian games were, according to most legends, insti­ <lb/>
            tuted by Apollo himself; other traditions referred them to <lb/>
            the ancient heroes, such as Amphictyon, Adrastus, Diomedes, <lb/>
            and others. They were originally, perhaps, nothing more <lb/>
            than a religious panegyris, occasioned by the oracle of <lb/>
            Delphi; and the sacred games are said to have been at first <lb/>
            only a musical contest, which consisted in singing a hymn in <lb/>
            honour of the Pythian god, with the accompaniment of the <lb/>
            cithara. Some of the poets, however, and mythographers <lb/>
            represent even the gods and the early heroes as engaged in <lb/>
            gymnastic and equestrian contests at the Pythian games. <lb/>
            But such statements, numerous as they are, can prove no­ <lb/>
            thing : they are anachronisms, in which late writers were <lb/>
            fond of indulging. The description of the Pythian games in <lb/>
             <pb n="48"/>
            which Sophocles, in the Electra, makes Orestes take part, <lb/>
            belongs to this class. The Pythian games must, on account <lb/>
            of the celebrity of the Delphic oracle, have become a national <lb/>
            festival for all the Greeks at a very early period; and when <lb/>
            Solon fixed pecuniary rewards for those Athenians who were <lb/>
            victims in the great national festivals, the Pythian agon <lb/>
            was undoubtedly included in the number, though it is not <lb/>
            expressly mentioned.</p>
          <p>Whether gymnastic contests had been performed at the <lb/>
            Pythian games previous to 01. 47, is uncertain.</p>
          <p>Böckh supposes that these two kinds of games had been <lb/>
            connected at the Pythia from early times, but that after­ <lb/>
            wards the gymnastic games were neglected : but, however <lb/>
            this may be, it is certain that about Olympiad 47 they did <lb/>
            not exist at Delphi Down to Olympiad 48 the Delphians <lb/>
            themselves had been the agonothetæ at the Pythian games; <lb/>
            but in the third year of this Olympiad, when, after the <lb/>
            Crissœan war, the A mphictyons took the management under <lb/>
            their care, they naturally became the agonothetæ. Some of the <lb/>
            ancients date the institution of the Pythian games from this <lb/>
            time, and others say that henceforth they were called Pythian <lb/>
            games. Owing to their being under the management of <lb/>
            Amphictyons, they are sometimes called ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αμφικτυονικὰ ἆθλα</foreign>. <lb/>
            From Olympiad 48, 3, the Pythiads were occasionally used <lb/>
            as an era, and the first celebration under the Amphictyons <lb/>
            was the first Pythiad. Pausanias expressly states that in <lb/>
            this year the original musical contest in <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κιθαρωδία</foreign> was ex­ <lb/>
            tended by the addition of <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐλω̨</foreign> ; i. e. singing with the <lb/>
            accompaniment of the flute, and by that of flute-playing <lb/>
            alone. Strabo, in speaking of these innovations, does not <lb/>
            mention the <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐλω̨δία</foreign>, but states that the contest of cithara- <lb/>
            players (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κιθαρισταί</foreign>) was added; while Pausanias assigns the <lb/>
            introduction of this contest to the eighth Pythiad.</p>
          <p>One of the musical contests at the Pythian games in which <lb/>
             <pb n="49"/>
            only flute and cithara-players took part, was the so-called <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">νόμος πυθικός</foreign> ; which, at least in subsequent times, con­ <lb/>
            sisted of five parts ; viz., <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνάκρουσις, ἄμπειρα, κατακελευσμὸς, <lb/>
            ἲαμβοι καὶ δάκτυλοι</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">σύο̡ιγγες</foreign>. The whole of this <foreign xml:lang="grc">νόμος</foreign> <lb/>
            was a musical description of the fight of Apollo with the <lb/>
            dragon, and of his victory over the monster. A somewhat <lb/>
            different account of the parts of this <foreign xml:lang="grc">νόμος</foreign> is given by the <lb/>
            scholiast on Pindar, and by Pollux.</p>
          <p>Besides these innovations in the musical contests which <lb/>
            were made in the first Pythiad, such gymnastic and eques­ <lb/>
            trian games as were then customary at Olympia, were either <lb/>
            revived at Delphi, or introduced for the first time. The <lb/>
            chariot-race with four horses was not introduced till the <lb/>
            second Pythiad. Some games on the other hand wero <lb/>
            adopted, which had not yet been practised at Olympia; <lb/>
            viz., the <foreign xml:lang="grc">δολιχός</foreign>, and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίαυλος</foreign>, for boys. In the first <lb/>
            Pythiad the victors received <foreign xml:lang="grc">χρήματα</foreign> as their prize, but in <lb/>
            the second a chaplet was established as the reward for <lb/>
            the victors. The scholiasts on Pindar reckon the first <lb/>
            Pythiad from this introduction of the chaplet, and their <lb/>
            system has been followed by most modern chronologerg, <lb/>
            though Pausanias expressly assigns this institution to the <lb/>
            second Pythiad. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐλω̨δία</foreign>, which was introduced in the <lb/>
            first Pythiad, was omitted at the second, and ever after, as <lb/>
            only elegies and <foreign xml:lang="grc">θρη̃νοι</foreign> had been sung to the flute, which <lb/>
            were thought too melancholy for this solemnity. The <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τεθρίππος</foreign>, or chariot-race with four horses, however, was <lb/>
            added in the same Pythiad. In the eighth Pythiad (Olym­ <lb/>
            piad 55, 3) the contest in playing the cithara without singing <lb/>
            was introduced; in Pythiad 23, the foot-race in arms was <lb/>
            added ; in Pythiad 48, the chariot-race with two full-grown <lb/>
            horses (<foreign xml:lang="grc">συνώριδος δρόμος</foreign>) was performed for the first time; <lb/>
            in Pythiad 53, the chariot-race with four foals was intro­ <lb/>
            duced ; in Pythiad 61, the pancratium for boys : in Pythiad <note type="footnote"> E </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="50"/>
            53, the horse-race with foals; and in Pythiad 69, the chariot- <lb/>
            race with two foals was introduced. Various musical con <lb/>
            tests were also added in the course of time ; and contests in <lb/>
            tragedy, as well as in other kinds of poetry, and in recitations <lb/>
            of historical compositions, are expressly mentioned. Works <lb/>
            of art, as paintings and sculptures, were exhibited to the <lb/>
            assembled Greeks, and prizes were awarded to those who <lb/>
            had produced the finest works. The musical and artistic <lb/>
            contests were at all times the most prominent feature of the <lb/>
            Pythian games, and in this respect they even excelled the <lb/>
            Olympic games.</p>
          <p>Previous to Olympiad 48, the Pythian games had been an <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνναετηρίς</foreign> ; that is, they had been celebrated at the end <lb/>
            of every eighth year; but in Olympiad 48, 3, they became, <lb/>
            like the Olympia, a <foreign xml:lang="grc">πενταετηρίς</foreign> ; i. e., they were held at the <lb/>
            end of every fourth year ; and a Pythiad, therefore, ever <lb/>
            since the time that it was used as an era, comprehended a <lb/>
            space of four years, commencing with the third year of every <lb/>
            Olympiad. Others have, in opposition to direct statements, <lb/>
            inferred from Thucydides that the Pythian games were held <lb/>
            towards the end of the second year of every Olympiad.</p>
          <p>As for the season of the Pythian games, they were in all <lb/>
            probability held in the spring, and most writers believe that <lb/>
            it was held in the month of Bysius, which is supposed to be <lb/>
            the same as the Attic Munychion. Böckh, however, has <lb/>
            shown that the games took place in the month of Bucatius, <lb/>
            which followed after the month of Bysius, and that this <lb/>
            month must be considered the same as the Attic Muny­ <lb/>
            chion. The games lasted for several days, as is expressly <lb/>
            mentioned by Sophocles, but we do not know how many <lb/>
            Then ancient writers speak of the day of the Pythian <lb/>
            gon, they are probably thinking of the musical agon alone, <lb/>
            which was the .'ost important part of the games, and pro­ <lb/>
            bably took place on the 7th of Bucatius. It is quite impos- <lb/>
             <pb n="51"/>
            Bible to conceive that all the numerous games should have <lb/>
            taken place on one day.</p>
          <p>The concourse of strangers at the season of this panegyris <lb/>
            must have been very great, as undoubtedly all the Greeks <lb/>
            were allowed to attend. The states belonging to the Am­ <lb/>
            phictyony of Delphi had to send their theori in the month <lb/>
            of Bysius, some time before the commencement of the <lb/>
            festival itself. All theori sent by the Greeks to Delphi, on <lb/>
            this occasion, were called <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πυθαἲσταί</foreign>, and the theories sent <lb/>
            by the Athenians were all particularly brilliant. As regards <lb/>
            sacrifices, processions, and other solemnities, it may be pre­ <lb/>
            sumed that they resembled, in a great measure, those of <lb/>
            Olympia. A splendid, though probably in some degree <lb/>
            fictitious, description of a theoria of Thessalians may be read <lb/>
            in Heliodorus.</p>
          <p>As to the order in which the various games were per­ <lb/>
            formed, scarcely anything is known, with the exception of <lb/>
            some allusions in Pindar, and a few remarks in Plutarch. <lb/>
            The latter says, that the musical contests preceded the <lb/>
            gymnastic contests ; and from Sophocles, it is clear that <lb/>
            gymnastic contests preceded the horse and chariot-races. <lb/>
            Every game, moreover, which was performed by men and <lb/>
            boys, was always first performed by the latter.</p>
          <p>We have stated above, that down to Olympiad 48, the <lb/>
            Delphians had the management of the Pythian games; <lb/>
            but of the manner in which they were conducted previous <lb/>
            to that time nothing is known. When they came under 1 he <lb/>
            care of the Amphictyons, especial persons were appointed <lb/>
            for the purpose of conducting the games, and of acting as <lb/>
            judges They were called ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Επιμεληταί</foreign>, and answered to the <lb/>
            Olympian Hellanodicæ. Their number is unknown. In <lb/>
            later times it was decreed by the Amphictyons, that king <lb/>
            Philip, with the Thessalians and Bœotians, should undertake <lb/>
            the management of the games; but afterwards, and even <note type="footnote"> E 1</note> <lb/>
             <pb n="52"/>
            under tLe Roman emperors, the Amphictyons again appeared <lb/>
            in the possession of this privilege. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">ίατηλεμιπἐ</foreign> had to <lb/>
            maintain peace and order, and were assisted by <foreign xml:lang="grc">μαστιγοφόροι</foreign>, <lb/>
            who executed any punishment at their command, and thus <lb/>
            answered to the Olympian <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλυταί</foreign>. The prize given to the <lb/>
            victors in the Pythian games was, from the time of the <lb/>
            second Pythiad, a laurel chaplet; so that they then became <lb/>
            an <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγὼν στεφανίτης</foreign>, while before they had been <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγὼν χο̡η­ <lb/>
            ματίτης</foreign>. In addition to this chaplet, the victor here, as at <lb/>
            Olympia, received the symbolic palm-branch, and was allowed <lb/>
            to have his own statue erected in the Crissæan plain. The <lb/>
            time when the Pythian games ceased to be solemnized is not <lb/>
            certain; but they probably lasted as long as the Olympic <lb/>
            games, i. e. down to the year A.D. 394. In A.D. 191, a <lb/>
            celebration of the Pythia is mentioned by Philostratus; and <lb/>
            in the time of the emperor Julian, they still continued to be <lb/>
            held, as is manifest from his own words. Pythian games <lb/>
            of less importance were celebrated in a great many other <lb/>
            places, where the worship of Apollo was introduced; and <lb/>
            the games of Delphi are sometimes distinguished from <lb/>
            these lesser Pythia by the addition of the words iv <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δελφο</foreign>ĩ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ς</foreign>. <lb/>
            But, as by far the greater number of the lesser Pythia are <lb/>
            not mentioned in the extant ancient writers, and are only <lb/>
            known from coins or inscriptions, we shall only give a list <lb/>
            of the places where they were held:—Ancyra in Galatia, <lb/>
            Aphrodisias in Caria, Antiochia, Carthæ in the island of <lb/>

            clearly learnt this lesson ; for with the friendly sons of <lb/>
            Cronus having obtained a sweet life, he was not able to bear <lb/>
            the huge bliss, when with maddened heart he was enamoured <lb/>
            of Here, whom the delightful couch of Zeus has obtained ; <lb/>
            but insolence impelled him to the overweening crime, and <lb/>
            soon did the man in suffering the just deserts of his crime, <lb/>
            receive especial woe. Now, too, these two offences are the <lb/>
            cause of toil to him in the realms below: in the first place, <lb/>
            because he, the first demigod, brought upon mortals, and that <lb/>
            not without cunning, kindred blood, and next, too, because <lb/>
            that once in the spacious chambers of heaven, he attempted <lb/>
            the spouse of Zeus. It is right that, according to his own <lb/>
            condition, a man should always keep in view the bounds of <lb/>
            everything. i But a lawless union in time past hurled him to <lb/>
            great misery, and not unwilling too; since he lay with a <lb/>
            cloud, pursuing as he did a sweet fraud, he, unknowing man ! <lb/>
            for in form it resembled the most eminent of the goddesses <lb/>

            placed as a snare for him, a beauteous ruin. And he wrought j <lb/>
            for himself the four-spoked bond, his own destruction ; and <lb/>
            having been thrown into inevitable fetters, he took upon <lb/>

            coming of the nuptial board, nor the joyful shout of the <lb/>
            loud-sounding wedding songs, d in such manner as her com­ <lb/>
            panion maidens equals-in-years are wont toe soothe the bride <lb/>
            with evening serenades ; but of a truth she was enamoured <lb/>
            of the absent, as many have ere now been affected. For <lb/>
            there is among men a most foolish race, who disdaining <lb/>
            things of their own land,! look round for what is remote, <lb/>
            pursuing idle visions with fruitless hopes.</p>
          <p>The bold fair-robed Coronis g incurred such mighty ruin : <lb/>
            for she slept in the couch of a stranger who came from <lb/>
            Arcadia; nor did she escape the notice of the ever-watching <lb/>
            one j for happening to be at the victim-receiving Pytho, <lb/>
            Loxias, lord of the temple, perceived the matter in his most <lb/>
            direct informant, his mind that knoweth all things ; he, I say, <lb/>
            having persuaded his understanding; h for he lays not hold <lb/>
            of i falsehoods, and neither god nor mortal deceives him by <lb/>
            deeds or thoughts.</p>
          <p>And then Phœbus, having perceived the foreign embrace <lb/>
            and the lawless fraud of Ischys son of Elatus, sent his sister, <lb/>
            storming with irresistible rage, to Laceria ; since the maiden <lb/>
            dwelt at the precipices of the Bœbian lake : and a hostile <lb/>
            dæmon k having allured her to evil, subdued her ; and many <lb/>
            of the neighbours hence received destruction, l and perished <lb/>

            consumed much wood on the mountain.m But when her <lb/>
            relatives placed the maiden on the mound of wood, and the <lb/>
            furious blaze of Hephæstus surrounded her, then Apollo <lb/>
            spoke : “ I will endure no further in my soul to destroy n my <lb/>
            offspring in a most piteous death, involved in the grievous <lb/>
            calamity of his mother." Thus he spoke, and at the first <lb/>
            stop having reached the boy, he snatched him from the <lb/>
            corpse, and the blazing pyre clave asundero for him ; and <lb/>
            then he bore and gave him to the Magnesian Centaur, to <lb/>
            teach him how to cure manifold diseases for mortals. Those, <lb/>
            therefore, as many as came afflicted with self-caused ulcers, or <lb/>
            wounded as to their limbs, either with gleaming brass or by <lb/>
            the far-hurled stone, or wasted as to their frame by the sum­ <lb/>
            mer's fire or winter's cold, freeing different persons from <lb/>
            different pains, he rescued them; tending some with gentle <lb/>
            charms, and others by drinking soothing potions, or binding <lb/>
            on all sides round their limbs plasters made from herbs, and <lb/>
            others by amputation he raised erect from sickness ; but <lb/>
            even wisdom has been bound by desire of gain, and gold <lb/>
            shining in the hand, by a magnificent reward induced even <lb/>
            him to restore from death a man already seized by it: and <lb/>
            then Zeus, hurling with his hands a bolt through both, <lb/>
            speedily took away the breath of their breasts, and the flash­ <lb/>
            ing bolt inflicted death. We ought to implore with human <lb/>
            thoughtsp what is suitable from the deities, having come to <lb/>
            know what is near at hand,q of what a destinyr we are. <lb/>
            Strive not, 0 my soul, at immortal life, but use to the <lb/>
            atmost the means within thy power.</p>
          <p>But if the discreet Chiron still inhabited his cave, and if in <lb/>
            any respect my melodious hymns could have put a spell upon <lb/>
            his mind, I would in truth have persuaded him even now to <lb/>
            furnish to good men a healer of feverish diseases, either some <lb/>
            son of Apollo or of his sire ; and I would have gone in ships <lb/>

            citizens, and a marvellous fatherS to strangers. For whom, <lb/>
            if I had reached the land, bringing two delights, golden <lb/>
            health and festal procession, bright glory to the wreaths of <lb/>
            the Pythian victories, which Pherenicus, best in the race, <lb/>
            formerly won in Cirrha, I assert that, as a light more far- <lb/>
            shining than a star of heaven, I should have come to him, <lb/>
            after that I had crossed the deep sea. But I am desirous to <lb/>
            address my prayer to the mother of the gods, the revered <lb/>
            goddess, whom, along with Pan, the maidens by my porch <lb/>
            often celebrate in song by night.</p>
          <p>But if, 0 Hiero, thou understandest how to read aright <lb/>
            the recondite sense of legendary tales, thou knowest, being <lb/>
            instructed by those of old,t that, for one blessing, the immor­ <lb/>
            tals distribute two evils together for mortals. These more <lb/>
            numerous evils, however, the foolish are not able to endure <lb/>
            becomingly, but the good do so endure them, having turned <lb/>
            their bright side out to view. But the lot of happiness <lb/>
            accompanies thee. For mighty Fate regards with favour a <lb/>
            sovereign leader of the people, if it does any man. But a life <lb/>
            without trip or stumble happened neither to Peleus, son of <lb/>
            Æacus, nor to the godlike Cadmus, who verily are said to <lb/>
            have possessed the highest bliss of mortals, seeing that they <lb/>
            heard the Muses with the golden frontlet carolling, on the <lb/>
            mountain and in seven-gated Thebes, when the one wedded <lb/>
            full-eyed Harmonia, and the other Thetis, the far-famed <lb/>
            daughter of wise Nereus. And the gods feasted with both, <lb/>
            and they beheld the kingly sons of Cronus on thrones of <lb/>
            gold, and received nuptial gifts ; and through the favour of <lb/>
            Zeus having escaped from former evils, they raised their <lb/>
            heart erect. But afterwards, however, the one,u did his three <lb/>
            daughters, by their sharp afflictions, deprive of a portion of <lb/>
            his happiness ; but father Zeus came to the coveted couch of <lb/>
            the white-armed Thyone. But the son of the other,v whom <lb/>
            being an only child the immortal Thetis brought forth in <lb/>
            Pthia, he, I say having lost his life in war by the bow, called <lb/>
            forth, when burnt with the funereal fire, wailing from the <lb/>
            Greeks. But if any one of mortals holdeth in his mind the <lb/>
            way of truth,w he ought, for that he has obtained them from <note type="footnote"> s v. 72 : i. e. patron. t v. 81 : </note><note type="footnote">i. e. by former poets. </note><note type="footnote"> u v. 97 : i.e. Cadmus. </note><note type="footnote">v v. 100 : Achilles, son of Peleus. </note><note type="footnote"> w v. 103: i. e. the true and right course of action. </note> <lb/>

            from her immortal mouth, queen as she was of the Colchians. <lb/>
            And thus she spoke to the demi-god sailors of Jason the <lb/>
            warrior:</p>
          <p>“ Hear, 0 children of daring heroes and of gods! for I <lb/>
            declare, that from this sea-beaten earth the daughter of <lb/>
            Epaphusc shall some day plant a root of cities,d object of <lb/>
            love to men, in the place where Zeus Ammone stands. <lb/>
            And taking in exchange swift steeds for short-finned <lb/>
            dolphins and reins for oars,f they shall ply the storm-footed <lb/>
            steeds. For that augury g shall at last bring about that <lb/>
            Thera be the mother-city of mighty cities ; that augury, I <lb/>
            say, which late at the mouth of the Tritonian lake, at the <lb/>
            hands of a god in the form of a man giving earth in token <lb/>
            of hospitality, Euphemus, having descended from the prow, <lb/>
            received : and, auspicious for him, Father Zeus son of <lb/>
            Cronus made the thunder roar; as upon the ship they were <lb/>
            hanging the anchor with tooth of brass, the curb of the <lb/>
            swift Argo. For twelve days before, out of Ocean, we bore <lb/>
            over the desert ridges of earth the bark, having drawn it up <lb/>
            on shore by my advice. Then the deity, lone-roving, came <lb/>
            upon us, having assumed the bright appearance of an august <lb/>
            man; and he commenceth friendly words, as the hospitable <lb/>
            first offer refreshment to guests on their arrival; but we <lb/>
            would not avail ourselves of his hospitality, for the cause <lb/>
            of a sweet return hindered us from remaining : and <lb/>
            he said that he was Eurypylus, son of the immortal Earth- <lb/>
            shaker,h and he knew that we were hastening; therefore, <lb/>
            immediately snatching the sod of earth which was nearest <note type="footnote"> b v. 10 : Qu. inspired. </note><note type="footnote">c v. 14 : i. e.

             <pb n="67"/>
            him, he shove to offer it as a gift of hospitality. Nor did <lb/>
            lie!, refuse compliance to him, but the hero having leaped <lb/>
            upon the shore and having stretched his hand to the hand <lb/>
            of the god, received the heaven-sent clod. But I hear that <lb/>
            it fell overboardi from the sea-washed ship, and was carried <lb/>
            away by the brine at evening, driven onward by the moist <lb/>
            ocean. Of a surety often did I urge the labour-lightening <lb/>
            attendants to guard it; but their minds forgot. And now <lb/>
            in this island is shed the imperishable seed of spacious <lb/>
            Libya before the appointed time.j For if Euphemus had, at <lb/>
            his home, cast it near the mouth of subterranean Hades, <lb/>
            Euphemus, I say, having arrived at sacred Tænarus, he, the <lb/>
            royal son of Poseidon ruler of the steed, whom formerly <lb/>
            Europa, daughter of Tityus, bore by the banks of Cephisus, <lb/>
            had he done so, I say, then Iris blood in the fourth offspring <lb/>
            would, along with the Danai, have taken that wide continent. <lb/>
            For then they shall set out from mighty Lacedæmon, and <lb/>
            from the Argive gulf, and from Mycenæ. But now, indeed,k <lb/>
            he shall find in the bed of foreign women a chosen seed, <lb/>
            which with the favour of the gods having come to this <lb/>
            island, shall be parents to a hero, lord of the black-soiled <lb/>
            plains; whom, at some future time, in his gold-adorned <lb/>
            temple, Phoebus shall warn with oracles when he has entered <lb/>
            the Pythian shrine, that in after time he is to conduct in <lb/>
            ships many men to the rich precinct of Zeus Nilus.”l</p>
          <p>Of a surety such was the order of Medea's words.m And <lb/>
            motionless, in dumb amazement, did the godlike heroes <lb/>
            cower down, hearing the sage counsel.</p>
          <p>0 blest son of Polymnestus, thee, agreeably to this pre­ <lb/>

            to the Muses to celebrate; for the Minyæ having sailed after <lb/>
            that fleece, divine honours were won by them.</p>
          <p>What commencement of the voyage awaited them ? q <lb/>
            What peril held them bound with strong rivets of adamant ? <lb/>
            It was fated that Pelias should die by the hands, or by the <lb/>
            unflinchingr plots of the high-born sons of Æolus. And the <lb/>
            prediction fell chill upon his wise soul, uttered near the <lb/>
            mid-navel of mother earth, clothed with fair woods; "to <lb/>
            stand by all means greatly on his guard against the one­ <lb/>
            sandalled man, when, from a lofty abode, he should come to <lb/>
            the sunny land of the far-famed Iolcos, a stranger, or being <lb/>
            a citizen." And he, as you might expect, in time came with <lb/>
            two javelins, a wondrous hero ; and a garment of both kinds <lb/>
            clothed him ; both the garment, that is to say, used in the <lb/>
            country of the Magnesians, fitting closely to his wondrous <lb/>
            limbs, and, on the other hand, he kept off, with a panther's <lb/>
            skin thrown round him, shivering rains ; nor were the shining <lb/>
            tresses of his locks shorn and gone, but they floated down <lb/>
            his whole back. Then, forthwith, advancing straight on­ <lb/>
            ward, he stood, putting to the proof his undaunted soul, in the <lb/>
            market-place, where the multitude thronged. But him they <lb/>
            knew not: yet, some one from among the reverently-gazing <lb/>
            crowd said this amongst other things: “ Surely, methinks, this <lb/>
            is not Apollo, nor, moreover, is it Aphrodite's paramour with <lb/>
            bis brazen car, and they say that in bright Naxos the chil­ <lb/>

          <p>They, indeed, in answer to each other, spoke in such <lb/>
            fashion : and borne by mules and a polished car, with head­ <lb/>
            long haste Pelias came hurrying; and forthwith he was <lb/>
            amazed, beholding the readily-recognized sandal solitary <note type="footnote"> p v. 65: or, number. </note><note type="footnote"> q v. 70 : i. e. what <unclear>origin</unclear> of the voyage had they ? </note><note type="footnote"> r v. 72 : Qu. not to be repelled. </note> <lb/>

            around his right foot. But disguising his fear in his mind, <lb/>
            be addressed him : " What land, 0 stranger, dost thou boast <lb/>
            to be thy country? And who of earth-born women sent <lb/>
            thee forth from her aged womb ? Declare thy race, polluting <lb/>
            it not with most odious falsehoods." And him boldly with <lb/>
            gentle words thus he answered: “ I say that I bear with <lb/>
            me the instruction of Chiron; for I come from his cave <lb/>
            from Chariclo and Philyra, where the pure daughters of the <lb/>
            centaur reared me. And having accomplished twenty years, <lb/>
            and having done neither any dishonest action, nor spoken <lb/>
            any deceitful word to them, I have come to my home, <lb/>
            endeavouring to recover the ancient kingdom of my father, <lb/>
            which is now unjustly swayed by another, the kingdom which <lb/>
            Zeus formerly granted to the chieftain Æolus and to his <lb/>
            children. For I hear that Pelias unjustly, having obeyed <lb/>
            his envioust soul, violently seized it from my parents, its <lb/>
            lawful owners; who, as soon as ever I saw the light, fearing <lb/>
            the violence of the overbearing ruler, having instituted <lb/>
            mournful wailing in the palace for me, as having died, <lb/>
            amidst the wailings of women, sent me secretly in purple <lb/>
            swaddling-clothes intrusting their journey to the secrecy ot <lb/>
            night,u and gave me to Chiron, son of Cronus, to rear. But <lb/>
            of these matters know this to be the sum. Now the dwellings <lb/>
            of my noblev sires, 0 discreet citizens, declare to me clearly ; <lb/>
            for being the son of Æson and a native, I should not I fancy <lb/>
            come to a foreign land of aliens. Now the divine centaur <lb/>
            addressed me by the name of Jason." Thus he spoke; him, <lb/>
            indeed, as he entered, the eyes of his father recognized, and <lb/>
            from his aged eyelids gushed forth tears, since he rejoiced <lb/>
            in his soul, beholding his distinguished offspring fairest of <lb/>
            men.</p>
          <p>And to greet them, both the brothers of Æson came at <lb/>
            the report of his arrival; first at hand, Pheres, having left <lb/>
            the fountain Hyperæa, and from Messene came Amythaon : <lb/>
            and quickly came Admetus and Melampus, saluting in <lb/>
            friendly fashion their cousin. And in the fellowship of the <lb/>
            feast, Jason, receiving them with mild words, preparing <note type="footnote"> v. 102 : i. e. that I have received. </note><note type="footnote">t v. 109 : or, covetous. </note><note type="footnote"> u v. 115: i. e. travelling by night without imparting the matter <unclear>to</unclear> <lb/>

            a suitable banquet, prolonged all festivity culling for five <lb/>
            continuous days and nights the sacred flower- of enjoy­ <lb/>
            ment. But on the sixth laying before them the whole grave <lb/>
            matter, the hero recounted it from the very beginning to <lb/>
            his relatives; and they approved; and forthwith from the <lb/>
            banquet he sprung with them. And then they came to <lb/>
            the palace of Pelias; and rushing on they took their stand <lb/>
            within. And hearing them, he himself, the offspring of <lb/>
            Tyro decked with love-locks, met them; but Jason, with <lb/>
            mild voice, distilling x gentle discourse, laid the foundation <lb/>
            of wise words :—" Son of Petræan Poseidon, y the minds of <lb/>
            mortals are too swift to approve of crafty gain before justice, <lb/>
            though they come nevertheless to a hard reckoning: but <lb/>
            thee and me it behoveth, ruling our tempers, to weave <lb/>
            happiness for the future. I speak in truth to one who <lb/>
            knows : one and the same dam was mother to Cretheus and <lb/>
            Salmoneus bold in council; and in the third generation we, <lb/>
            in turn, begotten from them, behold the golden light of the <lb/>
            sun. But the Fates turn away in displeasure, if any enmity <lb/>
            arises among relations, so as to cast into the shade their <lb/>
            reverence for each other. It becometh not us two with <lb/>
            swords formed of brass, nor with javelins, to make partition <lb/>
            of the mighty dominion of our forefathers; for I give up to <lb/>
            thee both flocks of sheep and tawny herds of cattle, and all <lb/>
            the fields which, after taking them from my parents, thou <lb/>
            grazest, increasing thy wealth; nor does it grieve me that <lb/>
            these greatly furnish thy house with store of riches. But the <lb/>
            sovereign sceptre and the throne, on which of yore the son <lb/>
            of Cretheus sitting, administered justice aright to his eques­ <lb/>
            trian subjects, these; without causing trouble to us both, do <lb/>
            thou release to us, lest some more grievous evil arise from <lb/>
            them."</p>
          <p>Thus, then, he spoke: and gently too did Pelias answer <lb/>
            in return:</p>
          <p>“ Such as thou suggestest will I be ; but already the aged <lb/>
            part of life encompasses me ; but thy flower of youth is just <lb/>
            swelling up ; and thou hast ability to set aside the wrath of <lb/>
            the gods of the nether world. For Phrixus bids some, having <note type="footnote"> w v. 130 : or, prime. </note><note type="footnote">x or, letting fall. </note><note type="footnote"> y v. 138 : or, Poseid cleaver of the rocks. </note> <lb/>

            gone t o the dwe ling-place of Æetes, to rescue z his soul and to <lb/>
            bring the thick-fleeced hide of the ram, by which formerly he <lb/>
            was saved from the ocean and from the ungodly darts of his <lb/>
            stepmother. These things doth a wondrous dream that <lb/>
            came to me declare. And I inquired of the oracle at Castalia, <lb/>
            if aught was to. be further searched after : and the deity <lb/>
            enjoins upon me to prepare the convoy home for Phrixus by <lb/>
            a ship. a This toil do thou, nothing loth, accomplish : and on <lb/>
            such conditions, I swear that I will give up to thee the mo­ <lb/>
            narchy and the kingly power : may Zeus, the tutelar deity of <lb/>
            the race of both of us, be the mighty witness of the oath !"</p>
          <p>Having agreed to this compact, they indeed parted ; but <lb/>
            Jason himself now sent forth heralds to make known in every <lb/>
            quarter the intended voyage.</p>
          <p>And quickly came three sons unwearied in fight, of Zeus <lb/>
            son of Cronus, and of Alcmena with rapid-glancing eyes, and <lb/>
            of Leda ; and two heroes with hair that waved high in air, b <lb/>
            the race of the Earth-shaker, showing a sense of shame in <lb/>
            their strength, c came from Pylos and from the headland of <lb/>
            Tænarus : whose high fame, and that of Euphemus was con­ <lb/>
            summated in this expedition, and thine too, 0 widely-potent <lb/>
            Periclymenus. And, sent from Apollo, a harper, father of <lb/>
            songs, came, renowned Orpheus. And Hermes with wand <lb/>
            of gold, sent his two sons to unabating toil, the one Echion, <lb/>
            exulting were they in youthful strength,d and Eurytus, the <lb/>
            other. And quickly came on those who dwelt about the <lb/>
            roots of Pangæus; for not unwilling, with cheerful spirit, <lb/>
            Boreas, king of winds, more quickly made readye Zetes and <lb/>
            Calais, heroes both, with backs that bristled with purple <lb/>
            feathers.f And Here kindled the all-persuading, sweet desire <lb/>
            for the ship Argo in the heroes, that no one, being left <lb/>
            behind, should remain with his mother, leading a sodden life <lb/>
            of ease g but that, even on condition of death, he should seek <note type="footnote"> z or, bring back from a foreign land. </note> <note type="footnote"> a i. e. to prepare to bring back the soul of Phrixus by a ship. </note><note type="footnote"> b v. 172 : Qu. tall, or, long-haired. </note><note type="footnote"> c v. 173 : i. e. checking their strength.

            to find the fairest remedy for his valour, with the rest of his <lb/>
            peers.h</p>
          <p>But when the flower of sailors was gone down to Iolcos, <lb/>
            Jason, having praised all, numbered them. And then the <lb/>
            soothsayer Mopsus, divining with auguries from birds and <lb/>
            sacred lots, with forward soul made the crew embark.</p>
          <p>And when above the prow they hung the anchors, the <lb/>
            leader having taken in his hands a golden drinking-bowl, <lb/>
            standing on the stern, called upon i Zeus who hurls the <lb/>
            thunderbolt as a lance, father of the sons of Uranus, and the <lb/>
            swift-rushing blasts of the winds and the waves, and nights <lb/>
            and ocean paths,j and auspicious days and wished-for destiny <lb/>
            of return :k from the clouds a favourable voice of thunder <lb/>
            sounded in answer, and there came brilliant rays of <lb/>
            lightning, shooting apart.l The heroes took breath again, <lb/>
            relying on the omens of the Deity, and the seer Mopsus, <lb/>
            interpreting the augury, commanded them to ply the oars,m <lb/>
            announcing sweet hopes ; and rowing succeeded n from their <lb/>
            swift hands, unwearied.</p>
          <p>And, conducted on by the breezes of the south wind, they <lb/>
            came to the mouth of the Axine sea : there they founded a <lb/>
            holy, sacred-precinct of Poseidon of the Ocean, and a tawny <lb/>
            herd of Thracian bulls was there at hand,o and newly built of <lb/>
            stones the hollow of an altar's plane. And, being thrown <lb/>
            into deep danger, they prayed the lord of ships that they <lb/>
            might escape the irresistible movement of clashing rocks. <lb/>
            For there were twain endowed with life, and they whirled <lb/>
            more rapidly than the array of bellowing winds ; but now to <lb/>
            them that voyage of the demigods brought the close of life.P</p>
          <p>And thereafter they came to the Phasis; there they fought <lb/>

            first brought to men the mottled wryneck, tied on the four- <lb/>
            spoked wheel, having brought it from Olympus, having bound <lb/>
            on the indissoluble round the bird that inspires frantic <lb/>
            passion; and she taught the wise son of Æson words of incan­ <lb/>
            tation and charms, in order that he might disarm Medea of <lb/>
            compunction towards her parents, and that the longing for <lb/>
            Greece might agitate her, while her heart was inflamed with <lb/>
            love, with the scourge of desire. And quickly she showed <lb/>
            him the ways of bringing to a close the toils imposed by her <lb/>
            sire : and, mingling them with oil, she compounded antidotes <lb/>
            against stubborn pains, and gave them to him, wherewith <lb/>
            to anoint himself. And they plighted their troth to join <lb/>
            sweet mutual marriage with each other. But when Æetes <lb/>
            fixed down the adamantine plough in the midst of them, and <lb/>
            placed the oxen, which breathed from their yellow jaws flame <lb/>
            of blazing fire, and with their brazen hoofs, as they moved <lb/>
            their feet alternately, broke the ground-these he alone,? <lb/>
            having brought up, fixed securely to the yoke. And, draw­ <lb/>
            ing out straight furrows, he drove the oxen, and he furrowed <lb/>
            upr the back of the loamy soil a fathom's depth,s and thus he <lb/>
            spoke :—</p>
          <p>" This work having accomplished for me, let the king, who­ <lb/>
            ever he be that commandeth the vessel, bear off the imperish­ <lb/>
            able coverlid of the couch, the fleece resplendent with golden <lb/>
            wool." When then he had thus spoken, Jason having cast <lb/>
            off his saffron mantle, relying on the god, applied himself to <lb/>
            the task ; and the fire makes him not to waver, thanks to t <lb/>
            the injunctions of his hostess skilled in every drug. Drag­ <lb/>
            ging forth the plough, and having bound the necks of the <lb/>
            oxen with compulsory bonds,u and smiting their strong-ribbed <lb/>
            body with the terrible goad, the forceful hero accomplished <lb/>
            the appointed measure of his task : and Æetes, though in <lb/>
            speechless grief, groaned, marvelling at his might; and to the <lb/>
            strong hero his companions stretched forth loving hands, and <lb/>

            the brilliant hide, where the knives of Phrixus stretched it <lb/>
            out; but he hoped that he w would not accomplish for him <lb/>

            was held by the most furious jaws of a dragon, which in <lb/>

            For he, young among youths, but in counsels old, as if he <lb/>
            had experienced a life of a hundred years, deprives calumny <lb/>
            of its far-sounding tongue, and has learnt to hate the insolent, <lb/>
            not striving against the good, nor delaying the accomplish­ <lb/>

          <p>O Arcesilaus, blessed by the gods, thou, from the first <lb/>
            steps of an illustrious life, with glory pursuest after these b <lb/>
            by the favour of Castor of the golden car, who, after a wintry <lb/>

            forget not, when celebrated at Cyrene, roundc the sweet <lb/>
            garden of Aphrodite, to set the Deity indeed over aught <lb/>
            else, but love Carrhotus most of thy companions ;d who, <lb/>
            not bringing excuse, daughter of after-thought, late in <lb/>
            learning wisdom, has come to the mansions of the justly- <lb/>
            ruling sons of Battus ; but received as a guest at the water <lb/>
            of Castalia, he, with undamaged reins, has placed around thy <lb/>
            locks the prize for being first in the chariot-race in the sacred <lb/>
            spot e of twelve swift courses. For he broke in no way the <lb/>
            strength of the harness; but there is suspended as a votive <lb/>
            offering, all the workmanship of skilful artificers, which he <lb/>
            brought with him to the hollow plain of the god, after he <lb/>
            had passed the Crissæan hill; wherefore the cypress chapel <lb/>
            holds it close by the statue which the bow-bearing Cretans <lb/>
            placed in the Parnassian hall ;f the statue consisting of the <lb/>
            trunk of one tree, formed by natural growth. It behoveth <lb/>
            thee, therefore, with willing spirit, to go to meet thy bene­ <lb/>
            factor. And thee, 0 Carrhotus, son of Alexibius, the fair- <lb/>
            haired Charites render famous : and blest art thou, who hast, <lb/>
            although after great toil, a memorial of highest praise. For <lb/>
            amongst forty fallen charioteers, having with fearless mind <lb/>
            brought off thy chariot whole and entire, thou hast now come <lb/>
            from the famous contests to the plain of Libya, and to thy <lb/>
            native city.</p>
          <p>But no one is, or ever will be, without share of toils ; and <lb/>
            yet the ancient good fortune of Battus attends Arcesilaus, <lb/>
            assigning a variety of blessings, being the city's tower, and <lb/>
            most brilliant light of protection to strangers. From him <lb/>
            too did the loud-roaring lions fly through fear; since he <lb/>
            brought to them a voice unheard by them before, that came <lb/>
            across the sea, and Apollo, leader of the colony, gave the <lb/>
            beasts up to dread fear, in order that he might not fail to <lb/>
            make his oracles good to the ruler of Cyrene : Apollo who, <lb/>

            of thunder; and of this honour h never to deprive the life of <lb/>
            thy parents as long as the Fates may destine it to last.</p>
          <p>And even formerly the mighty Antilochus bore within, <lb/>
            this mind, Antilochus, who perished for his father, enduring <lb/>
            the attack of the man-slaying captain of the Ethiopian <lb/>
            host, Memnon; for a steed impeded the chariot of Nestor, <lb/>
            wounded by the arrows of Paris; and hei was hurling his <lb/>
            strong spear; and the agitated soul of the Messenian old <lb/>
            man called loudly on his son, nor in truth did he send forth <lb/>
            a cry that came to nought, but the godlike man, withstanding <lb/>
            the attack of Memnon, purchased by his own death the <lb/>
            rescue of his father, and having performed a mighty deed, <lb/>

          <p>Praise of Athens, the Athenians, and the Alcmæonidæ, the family of <lb/>
            the conqueror. Envy is deprecated.</p>
          <p>THE mighty city of Athens is the fairest prelude upon which <lb/>
            to lay a basement of song in honour of the widely-powerful <lb/>
            race of the Alemæonidæ for their steeds. a</p>

            Apollo, built in divine Pytho thy wondrous temple.</p>
          <p>And five victories at the Isthmus, and one distinguished <lb/>

            and thy ancestors. At thy recent victory I rejoice not <lb/>
            a little, but at that I am grieved, that envy repaysd illus­ <lb/>

          <p>1—20: Invocation of Hesychia (Peace or Tranquility). 21—60: Praise <lb/>
            of Aristomenes, to whom the poet applies the saying of Amphiaraus <lb/>
            concerning his son Almæon, one of the Epigoni, and interweaves the <lb/>
            prophecy of Amphiaraus concerning the taking of Thebes. 61—100 : <lb/>
            The various victories of Aristomenes are alluded to: reflections on the <lb/>
            uncertainty of human prosperity, and the shortness of life.</p>
          <p>O KINDLY Hesychia,a daughter of Justice, thou that makest <lb/>
            cities greatest, and hast of wars and of councils the <lb/>
            supreme keys, receive from Aristomenes honour for the <lb/>
            Pythian victory. b For thou knowest both how to give and <lb/>
            receive pleasing gifts at the proper season ;c but thou, when <lb/>
            any one shall have driven into his heartd relentless wrath, <lb/>
            roughly opposing the might of foes, castest their insolence <lb/>
            into the sea. Whome Porphyrion did not reflect that he <lb/>
            was unduly provoking. But that gain is the most agreeable, <lb/>
            which one bears offf from the dwelling of a willing giver ; <lb/>
            but violence is wont at last to overthrow even the very <lb/>

          <p>The Cilician hundred-headed Typho did not escape it,g nor <lb/>

            estranged from the Graces, touchingi the renowned virtues ot <lb/>
            the Æacidæ, but possesses perfect glory from the beginning. <lb/>
            For she is celebrated in song, in that she hath reared heroes <lb/>
            highest in many victorious contests and nimble fights, and <lb/>
            partly too j she is distinguished for population.</p>
          <p>But I lack leisure to consecrate to the lyre, and to the <lb/>
            sweet voice, the whole of the long discourse, lest satiety <lb/>
            supervening should offend ; but let that which is now present <lb/>

            praise which formerly Amphiaraus, the son of Oileus, myste­ <lb/>
            riously uttered, when he saw n the sons of the heroes at seven- <lb/>
            gated Thebes, bravely standing out the battle, what time <lb/>
            from Argos came on the second expedition, the Epigoni. <lb/>
            Thus he spoke, while they were fighting :—" By nature, the <lb/>
            high-born courage descended from their sires is conspicuous <lb/>
            in sons. Clearly do I behold Alcmæon, wielding foremost at <lb/>
            the gates of Cadmus a many-coloured dragon on a fiery o <lb/>
            shield. But he that suffered in the former disaster, he, the <lb/>
            hero Adrastus, is now held by the announcement p of a more <lb/>
            favourable omen ; but as to domestic matters, he shall fare the <lb/>
            reverse of this ; for he alone of the host of the Danai, having <lb/>
            gathered together the bones of his deceased son, shall by the <lb/>
            favour of the gods arrive with his army uninjured to the <lb/>
            spacious streets of Abas."q Such words did Amphiaraus <lb/>
            utter ; and with joy will I myself too deck Alcmæon with <lb/>

            again to awake the song and the ancient glory of his <lb/>

            Irasa, as suitors to win the fair-haired renowned daughter of <lb/>
            Antæus, whom very many princes of men her relatives sought <lb/>
            in marriage, and many also of strangers ; since her form was <lb/>
            admirable; and of her golden-crowned youth they each <lb/>
            desired to pluck the blooming fruit.</p>
          <p>But her father endeavouring to procure a more illustrious <lb/>
            marriage for his daughter, had heard of Danaus, what swiftest <lb/>
            nuptials he formerly in Argos found for his forty-and-eight <lb/>
            virgin daughters, before midday overtook them. For imme­ <lb/>
            diately he placed the whole band at once at the boundaryk <lb/>
            of the arena, and he bade all, as many as had come as their <lb/>
            wooers, to decide by contests of feet which maiden each one <lb/>
            of the heroes should possess. <note type="footnote"> d v. 91: i. e. at Megara. </note><note type="footnote"> c v. 92: or, distress, i. e. having by his victories escaped the igno­ <lb/>

          <p>And thus did the Libyan Antæus, joining her in marriage, <lb/>
            give a bridegroom to his daughter : at the line1 of the arena <lb/>
            he placed her, having decked her in fair attire, to be the <lb/>
            highest prize : and before them all he said, that he, who first <lb/>
            bounding forward should touch her garments with either <lb/>
            hand around- should lead her away as his bride. Then <lb/>
            Alexidamus, when he had swiftly run the rapid course, <lb/>
            taking the much-prized maiden by the hand with his hand, <lb/>

          <p>So the hero son of Atreus, having returned at length to <lb/>

            the prophetic maiden, after that he had destroyed the luxu­ <lb/>
            rious housesn of the Trojans, burnt along with their city on <lb/>
            account of Helen.0</p>
          <p>So it was that he, the infant child,? came to Strophius, his <lb/>
            aged friend, dwelling at the foot of Parnassus; but by the <lb/>
            help of tarrying Aresq he killed his mother, and laid <lb/>

          <p>NEMEAN Games (<foreign xml:lang="grc">νέμεα, νεμει̃α</foreign>, or <foreign xml:lang="grc">νεμαι̃α</foreign>), one of the four <lb/>
            great national festivals of the Greeks. It was held at <lb/>
            Nemea, a place near Cleonæ in Argolis. The various legends <lb/>
            respecting its origin are related in the arguments of the <lb/>
            Scholiasts to the Nemea of Pindar, with which may be <lb/>
            compared Pausanias and Apollodorus. All these legends, <lb/>
            however, agre&lt; in stating, that the Nemea were originally <lb/>
            instituted by the Seven against Thebes, in commemoration <lb/>
            of the death of Opheltes, afterwards called Archemorus. <lb/>
            When the Seven arrived at Nemea, and were very thirsty, <lb/>
            they met Hypsipyle, who was carrying Opheltes, the child <lb/>
            of the priest of Zeus and of Eurydice. While she showed <lb/>
            to the heroes the way to the nearest well, she left the child <lb/>
            behind, lying in a meadow, which during her absence was <lb/>
            killed by a dragon. When the Seven on their return saw <lb/>
            the accident, they slew the dragon, and instituted funeral <lb/>
            games (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγὼν ἐπιτάϕιος</foreign>), to be held every third year <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τριετηρικός</foreign>). Other legends attribute the institution of <lb/>
            the Nemean Games to Heracles, after he had slain the <lb/>
            Nemean lion ; but the more genuine tradition was, that he <lb/>
            had either revived the ancient games, or at least introduced <lb/>
            the alteration by which they were from this time celebrated <lb/>
            in honour of Zeus. That Zeus was the god in honour of <lb/>
            whom the games were afterwards celebrated, is stated by <lb/>
            Pindar. The games wer" at l.rst of a warlike character, <lb/>
             <pb n="102"/>
            and only warriors and their sons were allowed to take <unclear>part</unclear> <lb/>
            in them ; subsequently, however, they were thrown open to <lb/>
            all the Greeks. The games took place in a grove between <lb/>
            Cleonæ and Phlius. The various games, according to the <lb/>
            enumeration of Apollodorus, were horse-racing, running in <lb/>
            armour in the stadium, wrestling, chariot-racing, and discus, <lb/>
            boxing, throwing the spear, and shooting with the bow, <lb/>
            to which we may add musical contests. The Scholiasts on <lb/>
            Pindar describe the agon very imperfectly as <foreign xml:lang="grc">ίππικός</foreign> and <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">γυμνικός</foreign>. The prize given to the victors was at first a <lb/>
            chaplet of olive branches, but afterwards a chaplet of green <lb/>
            parsley. When this alteration was introduced, is not certain, <lb/>
            though it may be inferred from an expression of Pindar, who <lb/>
            calls the parsley (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σέλινον</foreign>) the <foreign xml:lang="grc">βοτάνα λεόντος</foreign>, that the new <lb/>
            prize was believed to have been introduced by Heracles. <lb/>
            The presidency at these games, and the management of <lb/>
            them, belonged at different times to Cleonæ, (Cormth, and <lb/>
            Argos, and from the first of these places they are sometimes <lb/>
            called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγων Κλεώναιος</foreign>. The judges who awarded the prizes <lb/>
            were dressed in black robes, and an instance of their justice, <lb/>
            when the Argives presided, is recorded by Pausanias. <lb/>
            Respecting the time at which the Nemean Games were <lb/>
            held, the Scholiast on Pindar merely states that they were <lb/>
            held on the 12th of the month of Panemus, though in another <lb/>
            passage he makes a statement which upsets this assertion. <lb/>
            Pausanias speaks of Winter N emea, and manifestly distin­ <lb/>
            guishes them from others which were held in summer. It <lb/>
            seems that for a time the celebration of the Nemea was <lb/>
            neglected, and that they were revived in Olympiad 53, 2, <lb/>
            from which time Eusebius dates the first Nemead. Hence­ <lb/>
            forth it is certain they were for a long time celebrated <lb/>
            regularly twice in every Olympiad, viz. at the commence­ <lb/>
            ment of every second Olympic year in the winter, and soon <lb/>
            atter the commencement of every fourth Olympic year <unclear>in</unclear> <lb/>

            the summer About the time of the battle of Marathon it <lb/>
            became customary in Argolis to reckon according to <lb/>
            Nemeads.</p>
          <p>In 208 B.C. Philip of Macedonia was honoured by the <lb/>
            Argives with the presidency of the Nemean Games, and <lb/>
            Quinctius Flaminius proclaimed at the Nemea the freedom <lb/>
            of the Argives. The Emperor Hadrian restored the horse- <lb/>
            racing of boys at the Nemea, which had fallen into disuse ; <lb/>
            but after his time they do not seem to have been much <lb/>
            longer celebrated, as they are no longer mentioned by any <lb/>
            of the writers of the subsequent period.</p><pb n="104"/>

            with the spear-bearing Ethiopians, that he might fix it in <lb/>

          <p>May it be allowed me to dedicate this strainb to Zeus son <lb/>
            of Cronus, and to Nemea and to the wrestling of Timesar­ <lb/>
            chus, as a prelude to my hymn; and may the fair-towered <lb/>
            seat of the Æacidæc receive it, Ægina which is, by its justice <lb/>
            that aideth the stranger, a common lightd to all.</p>
          <p>But if thy father Timocritus were still warmed by the <lb/>
            enlivening sun, oft harping the changeful strain, he would, <lb/>
            inclining his mind to this song, have swelled the hymn of <lb/>
            victory which sends thee the wreath of garlands both from <lb/>
            the Cleonæan contest,e and from brilliant honoured Athens, <lb/>
            and won in seven-gated Thebes; since near the stately tomb <lb/>
            of Amphitryon the Cadmæans not unwilling covered him <lb/>
            with flowers for Ægina's sake. For coming as a friend to <lb/>
            friends, he passed down the hospitable city to the blissful hall <lb/>
            of Heracles,f with whom of yore the mighty Telamon over­ <lb/>
            threw Troy and the Meropes and the huge warrior terrific <lb/>
            Alcyoneus, yet not before he had destroyed twelve four­ <lb/>
            yoked cars with a mass of rock, and twice as many heroes, <lb/>
            tamers of the steed, that rode therein. That man would <lb/>
            appear unskilled in the fortune of war,g who does not under­ <lb/>

            where Teucer the son of Telamon rules far from his native <lb/>
            soil; but Ajax sways as a tutelary god his paternal native <lb/>
            Salamis ; and in the Euxine Sea Achilles rules a bright island; <lb/>

            to the cattle gradually slope, beginning from Dodona, to the <lb/>

            arts of Hippolyta the spouse of Acastus. And by means of <lb/>

            accomplishment; and having quelled all-mighty fire and <lb/>
            sharpest claws of daring lions, and the edge of direst teeth, <lb/>
            he wedded one of the high-throned Nereids, and beheld the <lb/>

          <p>Which, formerly standing by the altar of the Hellenian <lb/>
            father, the renowned sons of Endais and the might of <lb/>

            to heaven—Phocus, I say, the son of the goddess, whom <lb/>
            Psamathea bore on the shore of the ocean.</p>
          <p>I fear to tell of a monstrous deed ventured upon not with <lb/>
            justice, how in truth they came to leave the glorious island <lb/>
            and what fortune drove the valiant heroes from CEnone. <lb/>
            I will pause : not every truth, though strictly true, is better <lb/>
            for showing its face ;d and silence is often the wisest thing <lb/>
            for a man to understand. But if it be resolved by me to <lb/>

            lead through all the various moods.f And they in the first <lb/>
            place, commencing the song from Zeus, hymned the revered <lb/>
            Thetis and Peleus, and how delicate Hippolyta, daughter of <lb/>

            heaven, and promised that soon he would obtain one of the <lb/>

            having persuaded Poseidon their kinsman, who from Ægæ <lb/>

            with the noise of the pipe receive him their god, and contend <lb/>

            The poet sets forth the praises of the Bassidæ and of Ægina, making <lb/>
            a passing mention also of the Æacidæ.</p>
          <p>ONE is the race of men, another is the race of gods, but from <lb/>
            one mother we both draw our breath ;a but a capacityb alto­ <lb/>
            gether different separates the races of men and gods; since the <lb/>
            one is nought, whilst the brazen heaven remaineth ever a <lb/>
            firm seat for the other. But still in some respect do we re­ <lb/>
            semble the immortals, either in mighty mind or in bodily <lb/>
            frame, though we know not to what goal of life either by day <lb/>
            or night fate has written for us to run.</p>
          <p>And now Alcimidas proves the innate talent of his race,c <lb/>
            so that we can see it like as in fruitful fields ; which alter­ <lb/>
            nately at one time give to men the plenteous sustenance of <lb/>
            the plains, and then at another time resting, collect their <lb/>
            strength.</p>
          <p>From the fair contests of Nemea came the youth that <lb/>
            contended in the games, who desiring to obtain this fortune <lb/>
            granted him by Zeus, hath now appeared no luckless hunter <lb/>
            in the wrestling, moving his foot in the footsteps of Praxi­ <lb/>

          <p>By thy aid too Sogenes the son of Thearion, distinguished <lb/>
            for his prowess, is sung glorious in the contests of the five <lb/>
            exercises. For he dwells in the city of the spear-clashing <lb/>
            Æacidæ, the city that loves to hear the song of victory ; and <lb/>
            greatly do they desire to cherish a spirit skilled in contests. <lb/>
            But if any one succeed in the contest, he affords delicious <lb/>
            subject of song to the streams of the Muses; for mighty <lb/>
            feats of strength are clouded by great obscurity, if they lack <lb/>
            the aid of hymns : but for noble deeds we know a mirror in <lb/>
            this way only,c if, through Mnemosyne with the bright <lb/>
            tiara, a man wins the recompense of his toils by the far- <lb/>
            famed songs of poetry.</p>
          <p>And the wise have learnt when the wind will blow on <lb/>

          <p>But I believe that the fame of Odysseus is become greater <lb/>
            than in proportion to what he suffered, through the sweet poet <lb/>
            Homer: since in his fictions and his winged art a something <lb/>
            majestic dwells and his skill deceives us, leading the mind <lb/>
            astray by fabled lore ; but the more numerous crowd of men <lb/>
            have a blind spirit. For if it were possible that it could see <lb/>
            the truth,e never would the mighty Ajax enraged about the <lb/>
            arms have driven the polished sword through his breast- <lb/>
            Ajax whom most mighty in battle except Achilles, the <lb/>
            guidance of the straight-blowing Zephyrus conveyed in swift <lb/>
            ships to the city of Ilus, that he might bring back his spouse <lb/>

            he only paid the debt of fate; for it was decreed by destiny, <lb/>

          <p>Bliss, surely, that hath been planted for mankind by the <lb/>
            favour of Providence, will abide most lastingly: —Providence <lb/>
            that loaded Cinyras too with wealth of yore in sea-girt <lb/>
            Cyprus. I stand on light feet,d and drawing in my breath <lb/>
            before I say aught. For much and in many ways has been <lb/>
            told of Cinyras; but to devise novel inventions e and to sub­ <lb/>
            ject them to the test of men's judgment for examination is <lb/>
            very perilous; for the praises you may bestow on others are a <lb/>
            treat for the envious to feed on, and envy ever attacks the <lb/>
            good, but does not molest the mean.</p>
          <p>Even the son of Telamon did it f torture and make to fall <lb/>
            upon his sword. For of a truth one, who though brave of <lb/>
            heart is not eloquent, oblivion often falls on in an evil <lb/>
            contest;? but the greatest reward is held out as a premium <lb/>
            to wily falsehood. For thus with fraudulent suffrages the <lb/>
            Greeks unjustly took the side of Odysseus, and Ajax deprived <lb/>
            of the golden arms wrestled with death.h Yet indeed very <lb/>
            different were the wounds that they,' when warring,J inflicted <lb/>
            with the spear that-defendeth-heroes on the livingk persons <lb/>
            of then foes, as well when fighting round the freshly-slain <lb/>
            Achilles, as on the deathful days of other toils.</p>
          <p>Hateful then we may conclude in former times also was <lb/>

            guile, ill-report that maketh mischief, which attacks what is <lb/>
            illustrious, but upholds the false glory of the obscure men. <lb/>
            May I never have this character, m father Zeus, but may I <lb/>
            hold to the guileless paths of life, that after my death I may <lb/>

            Nemean Ode is inscribed. The ode was composed some years after <lb/>
            the victory which it celebrates, probably in 01. 77, 1. B.C. 472. It <lb/>
            is to be observed that the last three so-called Nemean Odes do <lb/>
            not celebrate Nemean victories. " Some of the epinikia," says Müller <lb/>
            (Hist. of the Lit. of Ancient Greece, p. 221), " belong to other games. <lb/>
            For example, the second Pythian is not a Pythian Ode, but probably <lb/>
            belongs to games of Iolaus at Thebes. The ninth Nemean celebrates <lb/>
            a victory in the Pythia at Sicyon, not at Delphi. The tenth Nemean <lb/>
            celebrates a victory in the Hecatombæa at Argos. The eleventh <lb/>
            Nemean is not an epinikion, but was sung at the installation of a <lb/>
            prytanis at Tenedos. Probably the Nemean Odes were placed at the <lb/>
            end of the collection, after the Isthmian ; so that a miscellaneous <lb/>

            of Ætna, praises the glory of Chromius in war, his wealth and great­ <lb/>
            ness. 48—end : The ode concludes in a joyous and festive strain, <lb/>
            with a promise of some future encomiastic songs that may be sung at <lb/>

            the pipe to tell of the very prime of equestrian contests, <lb/>
            which Adrastus ordained for Phœbus on the streams of the <lb/>
            Asopus; which I calling to mind, will adorn with renowned <lb/>
            honours the hero, who then reigning there, with new fes­ <lb/>
            tivals and with contests of the strength of men, and with <lb/>
            cars adorned-with-carving, did proclaim and ennoble the <lb/>

            and from dread sedition, far away from the home of his <lb/>
            fathers and from Argos; and the sons of Talausf were no <lb/>
            longer rulers, having been prevailed over by faction.</p>
          <p>But a superior man ends a former quarrel.g And theyh <lb/>
            by giving Eriphyle who slew her lord as a wife to the SOIl <lb/>
            of Oicleus, like as one gives a faithful pledge of alliance, <lb/>
            became the greatest of the yellow-haired Danai. Thereupon <lb/>
            indeed did they of yore lead to the seven-gated Thebes a <lb/>
            host of men in the path of unpropitious omens; nor did the <lb/>
            son of Cronus by whirling round his lightning incite them, <lb/>
            maddened as they were, to march from their homes, but he <lb/>
            bade them abstain from their journey. So then the crowd <lb/>
            pressed on to arrive at manifest destruction, with their <lb/>
            brazen coats of armour and with the trappings of their steeds : <lb/>
            and upon the banks of the Ismenus having averted from <lb/>
            themselves sweet return,i they fed the pale smoke with their <lb/>
            corpses.j For seven pyres consumed the seven heroes with <lb/>
            youthful limbs: but for Amphiaraus Zeus with his all­ <lb/>
            powerful bolt clove the deep-bosomed earth, and hid him <lb/>
            with his horses, before that smitten on his back by the spear <lb/>

            life and death, with the spears of the Carthaginian host,m <lb/>
            and 1 entreat thee, 0 Father Zeus, long to grant to the <lb/>
            children of the Ætneans the fortune of an orderly state, and <lb/>
            to raise n the city to public festivities. There are in that <lb/>
            land, indeed, heroes that love the steed and who have souls <lb/>
            superior to wealth.o</p>
          <p>I have spoken a praise incredible to the low crowd ; for the <lb/>
            sense of honour that brings glory is secretly corrupted by <lb/>
            gain. Hadst thou served as shield-bearer to Chromius <lb/>
            amongst the foot-soldiers and the cavalry, and in the con­ <lb/>
            tests of ships, thou couldst have judged of his courage amidst <lb/>
            the danger of the sharp fight; since in war that goddess? <lb/>
            urged his warlike spirit to drive back the pest of Enyalius.q <lb/>
            But few are able to counsel how with hands and soul to <lb/>
            turn the cloud of war that is upon them upon the ranks of <lb/>
            the enemies. Verily for Hector it is said that glory bloomed <lb/>
            near the streams of the Scamander ; and upon the steep­ <lb/>
            cliffed banks of the Helorus, where men call the place the <lb/>
            ford of the fountain of Ares,r this light of victory looked on <lb/>
            the son of Agesidamus in the first years of manhood. And <lb/>
            other deeds will I assert to have been achieved by him, <lb/>
            on other days, many a one on the dusty land, and others on <lb/>
            the neighbouring sea.</p>
          <p>For from toils that are performed in youth and justly <lb/>
            done, there ariseth to old age a life of calmness., Let <lb/>
            Chromius know that he has obtained from the deities mar­ <lb/>
            vellous bliss. For if he should bear off honourable fame <lb/>
            combined with many possessions, it is not possible for mortal <lb/>
            man to attain still further with his feet to a higher eminence.</p>
          <p>The feast for its part loves quiet; and victory is nurtured <lb/>
            with fostering song, ever fresh sprouting; and near the bowl <lb/>
            the voice of the poet is bold.</p>

            Heracles, over the blooming lot of the contests, making men <lb/>
            of upright life their special care ; for faithful of a surety is <lb/>
            the race of the gods. With interchange, in turn one day do <lb/>
            they enjoy with their Father Zeus, and one do they spend <lb/>
            beneath the depths of the earth in the delL of Therapne, <lb/>
            filling up an equal doom : since, when Castor perished in <lb/>
            war, Polydeuces preferred this mode of existence rather than <lb/>
            to be himself altogether a god and dwell in heaven. For himY <lb/>
            did Idas, incensed somehow concerning his herd, wound <lb/>
            with the point of his brazen spear. Gazing keenly after <lb/>
            them from Taygetus, Lynceus beheld them sitting in ambush <lb/>
            in the trunk of an oak. For his, of all earthly men, was the <lb/>
            most piercing eye. With nimble feet forthwith theyz arrived <lb/>
            and quickly wrought a bold deed; viz., the death of Castor. <lb/>
            And grievous retribution the sons of Aphareus suffered at <lb/>
            the hands of Zeus; for immediately the son of Leda came <lb/>
            in hot pursuit, and they over against him took their post <lb/>
            hard by their fathers' tomb : thence snatching a decoration <lb/>
            of Death, a polished stone," they hurled it at the breast of <lb/>
            Polydeuces ; but they crushed him not, nor drove3 him back; <lb/>
            but rushing on straightway with spear swift in motion, he <lb/>
            drove the brass into the sides of Lynceus. And Zeus hurled <lb/>
            upon Idas his smouldering thunderbolt, and they both were <lb/>
            burnt together reft of mourners ; for a contest with the <lb/>
            powerful onesb is hard for men to deal with.</p>
          <p>Speedily to his mighty brother the Son of Tyndareus <lb/>
            returned back, and him he found not as yet dead, but with <lb/>
            short-drawn gasp ruckling forth his breath.0 Then shedding <lb/>
            warm tears with groans he cried loud and clear :—</p>
          <p>" 0 Father, son of Cronus, what end then shall there be of <lb/>
            my sorrows ! For me also together with him ordain death, <lb/>
            O monarch. Honour is departed from the man that is de­ <lb/>
            prived of his friends; and in distress few are there of <lb/>
            mortals faithful enough to go shares in toil" Thus he spoke, <lb/>
            and Zeus before him came and uttered this reply :—</p>
          <p>" Thou art my son; but him engendered after thee of mor­ <note type="footnote"> y i. e. Castor. </note><note type="footnote">z i. e.

            :al seed did her hero husband in approach to thy mother <lb/>
            beget. But come ; of these things in sooth I yet give thee <lb/>
            choice : if on the one hand thou art willing to escape death <lb/>
            and hateful old age, and to inhabit Olympus in company <lb/>
            with Athene and with Ares of the spear black with blood, <lb/>
            there is to thee indeed a rightful share of this ;d but if in <lb/>

          <p>Thus then when he (Zeus) spoke, no wavering resolution <lb/>

            dresses limbs that are mortal,d and that last of all he will <lb/>
            clothe himself with earth. Yet by the laudatory voices of <lb/>
            his fellow-citizens is it due that he be praised, and that I <lb/>

            pancratium.</p>
          <p>But the too timide hopes of his parents restrained the <lb/>
            might of their son from attempting the contests in Pytho <lb/>
            and in Olympia. For verily by my oath, in my opinion, at <lb/>
            Castalia and at the hill of Cronus abounding with fair trees, <lb/>
            had he gone thither, he would have returned more honour­ <lb/>
            ably than his adversaries that contested the prize against <lb/>
            him; having celebrated with festal pomp the solemnity of <lb/>
            Heracles that cometh every fifth year and having bound his <lb/>
            locks with bright wreaths. But of mortals one has empty- <lb/>
            minded pride cast out from expected blessings, while another, <lb/>
            distrusting over much his own strength, his spirit wanting <lb/>
            boldness, dragging him back by the hand, has made him <lb/>
            miss blessings that would have been his own.</p>

          <p>ISTHMIAN GAMES (<foreign xml:lang="grc">῎Ισθμια</foreign>), one of the four great national <lb/>
            festivals of the Greeks. This festival derived its name from <lb/>
            the Corinthian isthmus, where it was held. Where the <lb/>
            isthmus is narrowest, between the coast of the Saronic gulf <lb/>
            and the western foot of the Œnean hills, was the temple of <lb/>
            Poseidon, and near it was a theatre and a stadium, of white <lb/>
            marble. The entrance to the temple was adorned with an <lb/>
            avenue of statues of the victors in the Isthmian games, and <lb/>
            with groves of pine-trees. These games were said originally <lb/>
            to have been instituted by Sisyphus in honour of Melicertes, <lb/>
            who was also called Palæmon.</p>
          <p>Their original mode of celebration partook, as Plutarch <lb/>
            remarks, more of the character of mysteries, than of a great <lb/>
            and national assembly, with its various amusements, and <lb/>
            was performed at night. Subsequent to the age of Theseus, <lb/>
            the Isthmia were celebrated in honour of Poseidon; and <lb/>
            this innovation is ascribed to Theseus himself, who, accord­ <lb/>
            ing to some legends, was a son of Poseidon, and who, in the <lb/>
            institution of the new Isthmian solemnities, is said to have <lb/>
            imitated Heracles, the founder of the Olympian games.</p>
          <p>The celebration of the Isthmia was henceforth con­ <lb/>
            ducted by the Corinthians, but Theseus had reserved <lb/>
            for his Athenians some honourable distinctions; those <lb/>
             <pb n="142"/>
            Athenians who attended the Isthmia sailed across the <lb/>
            Saronic gulf in a sacred vessel (<foreign xml:lang="grc">θεωρις</foreign>), and an honorary <lb/>
            place (<foreign xml:lang="grc">προεδρία</foreign>) as large as the sail of their vessel was <lb/>
            assigned to them during the celebration of the games. In <lb/>
            times of war between the two states, a sacred truce was <lb/>
            concluded, and the Athenians were invited to attend at the <lb/>
            solemnities. The Eleans did not take part in the games, <lb/>
            and various stories were related to account for this singular <lb/>
            circumstance. It is a very probable conjecture of Wachsmuth, <lb/>
            that the Isthmia, after the changes ascribed to Theseus, <lb/>
            were merely a panegyris of the Ionians of Peloponnesus <lb/>
            and those of Attica; for it should be observed, that Posei­ <lb/>
            don was an Ionian deity, whose worship appears originally <lb/>
            to have been unknown to the Dorians. During the reign of <lb/>
            the Cypselids at Corinth, the celebration of the Isthmian games <lb/>
            was suspended for seventy years: but after this time they <lb/>
            gradually rose to the rank of a national festival of all the <lb/>
            Greeks. In Olympiad 49 they became periodical, and were <lb/>
            menceforth celebrated regularly every third year, twice in <lb/>
            every Olympiad, that is, in the first and third year of <lb/>
            every Olympiad. The Isthmia held in the first year of an <lb/>
            Olympiad fell in the Corinthian month Panemus (the Attic <lb/>
            Hecatombæon); and those which were held in the third <lb/>
            year of an Olympiad, fell either in the month of Munychion <lb/>
            or Thargelion. Pliny and Solinus erroneously state that <lb/>
            the Isthmia were celebrated every fifth year. With this <lb/>
            regularity the solemnities continued to be held by the <lb/>
            Greeks down to a very late period. In 228 B. c. the Romans <lb/>
            were allowed the privilege of taking part in the Isthmia ; <lb/>
            and it was in this solemnity, that, in 196 B.c., Flaminius <lb/>
            proclaimed before an innumerable assembly the i tide­ <lb/>
            pendence of Greece. After the fall of Corinth in 146 B.C., <lb/>
            the Sicyonians were honoured with the privilege of con­ <lb/>
            ducting the Isthmian games; but when the town of Corinth <lb/>
             <pb n="143"/>
            as rebuilt by Julius Cæsar, the right of conducting the <lb/>
            solemnities was restored to the Corinthians, and it seems that <lb/>
            they henceforth continued to be celebrated, till Christianity <lb/>
            became the state religion of the Roman empire. The season <lb/>
            of the Isthmian solemnities was like that of all the great <lb/>
            national festivals, distinguished by general rejoicings and <lb/>
            feasting.</p>
          <p>The contests and games of the Isthmia were the same as <lb/>
            those at Olympia, and embraced all the varieties of athletic <lb/>
            performances, such as wrestling, the pancratium, together <lb/>
            with horse and chariot-racing. Musical and poetical per­ <lb/>
            formances were likewise carried on, and in the latter women <lb/>
            were also allowed to take part, as we must infer from <lb/>
            Plutarch; who, on the authority of Polemo, states, that in <lb/>
            the treasury in Sicyon there was a golden book which had <lb/>
            been presented to it by Aristomache, the poetess, after she <lb/>
            had gained the victory at the Isthmia. At a late period of <lb/>
            the Roman empire, the character of the games at the Isthmia <lb/>
            appears greatly altered; for, in the letter of the Emperor <lb/>
            Julian, it is stated that the Corinthians purchased bears and <lb/>
            panthers for the purpose of exhibiting their fights at the <lb/>
            Isthmia; and it is not improbable that the custom of intro­ <lb/>
            ducing fights of animals on this occasion commenced soon after <lb/>
            the time of Cæsar. The prize of a victor in the Isthmian <lb/>
            games consisted at first of a garland of pine-leaves, and after­ <lb/>
            wards of a wreath of ivy ; but in the end the ivy was again <lb/>
            superseded by a pine-garland. Simple as such a reward was, <lb/>
            a victor in the games gained the greatest distinction and <lb/>
            honour among his countrymen; and a victory not only <lb/>
            rendered the individual who obtained it a subject of admira­ <lb/>
            tion, but shed lustre over his family, and the whole town or <lb/>
            community to which he belonged. Hence, Solon established <lb/>
            by a law, that eveiy Athenian who gained the victory at <lb/>
            the Isthmian games, should receive from the public treasury <lb/>
             <pb n="144"/>
            a reward of one hundred drachmae. His victory was gene­ <lb/>
            rally celebrated in lofty odes, called Epinikia, or triumphal <lb/>
            odes, of which we still possess some beautiful specimen <lb/>
            among the poems of Pindar</p><pb n="145"/>

          <p>THE men of ancient time, 0 Thrasybulus, who ascended into <lb/>
            the car of the Muses with-frontlet-of-gold, falling into the <lb/>
            company of a the famous lyre, lightly uttered melodious <lb/>
            hymns in praise of youths, namely for him whoever being <lb/>
            gifted with beauty possessed the summer-bloom of puberty, <lb/>
            the sweetest reminder of fair-enthroned Aphrodite. For the <lb/>
            Muse was not at that time as yet a lover of gain nor a hire­ <lb/>
            ling, nor were sweet, soft-voiced songs, with silver in their <lb/>
            faces,b sold by honey-toned Terpsichore.</p>
          <p>But now she (the Muse) bids us observe or attend to the <lb/>
            saying of the Argive (Aristodemus) that approacheth very <lb/>
            near the paths of truth ; “ Money, money isc the man," and <lb/>

            drove the steeds, which hand Nicomachus applied at the <lb/>
            right moment to all the reins. Nicomachus whom too the <lb/>
            heralds of the seasons,e the Elean announcers of the truce of <lb/>
            Zeus the son of Cronus, recognized; having experienced <lb/>
            from him, I ween, some hospitable office, and they saluted <lb/>
            him with sweetly-breathing voice as he fell into the lap of <lb/>
            golden victory in their own land, which in truth they call <lb/>
            the sacred precinct of Olympian Zeus; where the sons of <lb/>
            Ænesidamus were united to immortal honours. For your <lb/>
            house, 0 Thrasybulus, is not unacquainted with charming <lb/>
            triumphal revels, nor with songs of honied praise.</p>

            bring the honours of the Dwellers on Helicon to the abodes of <lb/>
            honoured men.</p>
          <p>Hurling the quoit afar, may I fling it as great a length, <lb/>
            as Xenocrates has possessed a disposition sweet beyond other <lb/>
            men! g Dignified indeed he was in his intercourse with his <lb/>
            fellow-citizens, and one that cultivated the rearing of the <lb/>
            steed according to the rule of universal Greece ; and he wel­ <lb/>
            comedh all the feasts of the gods ; nor did the fair-wind of <lb/>

            yet the sons of the gods assuredly alone are invulnerable.</p>
          <p>I have, by the grace of the gods, an endless path open to <lb/>
            me in every direction, 0 Melissus : for, at the Isthmia, thou <lb/>
            hast furnished me with facilities to follow up your virtues <lb/>
            with a hymn:d those virtues with which the Cleonymidæ <lb/>
            ever bloom abundantly, as they pass, with the aid of heaven, <lb/>
            through the whole period of man's life. But variously at <lb/>
            various times does the gale of human fortune burst upon and <lb/>
            urge on in their career all men. Theye assuredly are said to <lb/>
            have been honoured of yore at Thebes, and to have been the <lb/>
            public hosts of the neighbouring states, and free from noisy <lb/>
            insolence ; and whatever poetic testimonies of exceeding <lb/>
            glory related concerning deceased or living heroes fly to and <lb/>
            fro amongst men, these they have gained in all perfection; <lb/>
            and in the highest acts of manhood displayed by their family <lb/>
            they have reached the pillars of Heracles. Desire not to <lb/>
            attain to a further glory! For they were both trainers of <lb/>
            the steed, and they pleased brazen Ares. But, alas! in one <lb/>

            claimed that their chariot won, and in the Adrastean con­ <lb/>
            tests of Sicyon, gave them wreaths of triumphal song similar <lb/>
            to these from the poets of that time. Nor from the common <lb/>
            assemblies did they withhold their curved chariot, and they <lb/>
            rejoiced to contend with all the assembled Greeks in the <lb/>
            expense for the equipment of their steeds. For to those <lb/>
            who make no venture belongs inglorious obscurity. But ob­ <lb/>
            scurity of lot belongs even to those who contend, before that <lb/>
            they have arrived at the highest boundary ;h for fortune <lb/>
            gives us both of this and of that;i and the artifice of inferior <lb/>
            men has caught and supplanted the better man.j Ye know <lb/>
            no doubt the murderous strength of Ajax, which in the late <lb/>
            night having maimed with his own sword, he causes disgrace <lb/>
            to the children of the Greeks, as many as went to Troy.k <lb/>
            But Homer has honoured him among all men, Homer who, <lb/>
            by extolling all his merit and greatness, has pointed it out <lb/>
            for bards of after times to sing according to the canon of <lb/>
            divine epic verse. For thism travels on, endowed with speech <lb/>
            to all eternity. But if a poet shall have celebrated aught well, <lb/>
            then both over the all-fruitful earth and across the ocean <lb/>
            doth there proceed the splendour of the noble actions that he <lb/>
            sings of, ever inextinguishable.</p>
          <p>May we find the Muses propitious so as to light up that <lb/>
            torch of hymns for Melissus too, a scion of the stock of <lb/>
            Telesias—a wreath deserved of the Pancratium ! For re­ <lb/>
            sembling them in courage, he attains in the contest to the <lb/>

            lying upon its back withstands the swoop of the eagle. <lb/>
            And it is befitting, by trying every stratagem, to render <lb/>
            powerless one's foe. For he has not obtained a stature like <note type="footnote"> h v. 49: i. e. even those who contend at the games remain unknown <lb/>

          <p>O THEIA, mother of the sun, worshipped under many titles, <lb/>
            through thee it is that men esteem potent gold far beyond <lb/>
            all other things; for ships contending in the ocean and <lb/>
            horses in the chariots are through thy favour, 0 queen, <lb/>
            admired, in the quick-whirling encounters. And in the <lb/>
            contests of the games he too bath gained much-desired <lb/>
            glory, whose locks numerous crowns have wreathed, vic­ <lb/>
            torious either by might of hands or by swiftness of feet. <lb/>
            For the strength of man is proved distinguished through <lb/>
            the favour of Providence.</p>
          <p>But two things in truth alone cherish the most lovely <lb/>
            flower of life conjoined with fair-blooming wealth, to wit, if <lb/>
            any one, being blessed with success, hear himself well spoken <lb/>
            of.a Seek not to become Zeus : thou hast everything, if the <lb/>
            inheritance of these blessings come to thee : a mortal lot <lb/>
            befitteth mortals. Now for thee at the Isthmus, a double <lb/>
            victory in all its splendour, 0 Phylacidas, is laid up in store; <lb/>
            and at Nemea a victory in the pancratium is laid up as a <lb/>
            treasure for you both, for thee, I say, and for Pytheas thy <lb/>
            brother.</p>
          <p>But without the Æacidæ my heart tastes not the <lb/>
            sweets of hymns, but with the Charites I have come, in this <lb/>
            my ode, to the sons of Lampon, to this well-ordered state : <lb/>
            and since itb has turned itself to the illustrious path of <lb/>

            toils she has undergone. For the valiant warriors among her <lb/>
            heroes are wont to gain praise, and they are celebrated to <lb/>
            endless time both on the lyres and with the many-toned <lb/>
            harmonies of the pipe.</p>
          <p>The mighty Œneidæ too, held in revered honour through <lb/>
            the grace of Zeus in the brilliant sacrifices of the Ætolians, <lb/>
            have given a theme to wise men,c and in Thebes the steed- <lb/>
            driving Iolaus hath honour, and Perseus in Argos, and the <lb/>
            warlike might of Castor and of Polydeuces at the streams of <lb/>
            the Eurotas. But in Œnoned are honoured the stout-hearted <lb/>
            tempers of Æacus and his sons; who too in battle twice <lb/>
            sacked the city of the Trojans, following in the train of <lb/>
            Heracles, the first time, and afterwards with the Atreidæ.</p>
          <p>Proceed, now, I pray thee, from the beginning. Say, who <lb/>
            slew Cycnus, who Hector, and who the fearless captain of the <lb/>
            host of the Ethiopians, Memnon, clad in brass ? Who, pray, <lb/>
            smote with his spear the valiant Telephus beside the banks <lb/>
            of the Caicus ? It was they whose mouth proclaims the <lb/>
            glorious isle of Ægina as their country.e And of old has <lb/>
            Ægina been built on high, as a tower for lofty virtues to <lb/>
            climb :f full many shafts of praise does my eloquent tongue <lb/>
            possess to utter loudly concerning them. And so now in <lb/>
            time of war can Salamis, city of Ajax, testify that she bath <lb/>
            been preserved by her sailors in the deathful shower of Zeus <lb/>
            during the hail-storm slaughter of countless heroes. But for <lb/>
            all that, steeps boasting in silence:h Zeus dispenses various <lb/>
            fortune, Zeus, who is lord of all. But even such glories as <lb/>
            thesei love the joyful hymn of victory, bedewed with charm­ <lb/>

          <p>The son of Cleonicus prays, that having obtained c such <lb/>
            desires, he may receive death and hoary old age ; and I <lb/>
            invoke the lofty-throned Clotho and her sister Fates to follow <lb/>
            the noble demandsd of a man that is my friend.</p>
          <p>And you, 0 Æacidæ of the golden cars, you I say it is my <lb/>
            clearest law to besprinkle with praises, as often as I approach <lb/>
            this island.e But innumerable paths, a hundred feet in width, <lb/>
            of noble deeds, have been cut uninterruptedly even beyond the <lb/>
            fountains of the Nile, and through the Hyperboreans ;f nor <lb/>

            hears not of the glory of the hero Peleus, the blessed son- <lb/>
            in-law of the gods ; nor is there one which hears not of the <lb/>
            glory of Ajax, the son of Telamon, and of his father; whom, <lb/>
            along with the Tirynthians, as a zealous ally, the son of <lb/>
            Alcmena led on board his ships to war that-delighteth-in- <lb/>
            the-brazen-arms against Troy, the heroes' toil, on account of <lb/>
            the offences of Laomedon. And heg took Pergamia,h and <lb/>
            along with him he slew the nation of the Meropes, and the <lb/>
            herdsman Alcyoneus, huge as a mountain, after that he had <lb/>
            found him at Phlegræ, nor did Heracles spare with his hands <lb/>

            the expedition, he chanced to find them all feasting. The <lb/>
            warlike son, then, of Amphitryon as he stood there in lion’s <lb/>
            skin, did noblest Telamon call upon by name to make com­ <lb/>
            mencement with nectarean libations,i and he held up and <lb/>
            gave to him the goblet that held the wine, rough with gold. <lb/>
            He then having stretched up to heaven his <unclear>undonquered</unclear> <lb/>
            hands, uttered such words as these :—</p>
          <p>“If ever, O Father Zeus, thou hast heard my prayer will <lb/>
            propitious mind, now, I pray thee, now, with most earnest <lb/>
            prayers do I implore of thee a bold son by Eribcea for this <lb/>
            hero, so as to perfect the happiness of my friend watched <lb/>
            over by the Fates; and him (the son) strong in body, even <lb/>
            as this hide now envelopes me about, belonging to the beast <lb/>
            which first of all my toils I slew of yore in Nemea. And <lb/>
            let courage correspond with his stout frame.”</p>
          <p>Immediately as he said these words, the deity sent forth <lb/>
            to him the sovereign of birds, the mighty eagle ; and sweet <lb/>
            delight thrilled him within. And he said, speaking like a <lb/>
            prophet : “ There shall be to thee the son that thou askest, <lb/>
            O Telamon." And him, named after the bird that had <lb/>
            appeared, he called the very mighty Ajax, marvellous in after <lb/>
            times in the warlike toils of men. Thus then having spoken <lb/>
            he forthwith sat down. But for me it were tedious to re­ <lb/>
            count all his valiant deeds.</p>
          <p>For I have come, 0 Muse, the dispenser of triumphal <lb/>

            The mythical portion of the ode, commencing with the mythical con­ <lb/>

            as an arbitrator in disputes and quarrels; to the Æacidæ, distin­ <lb/>

            the immediate subject of his ode, the victories in the games of Nicocles, <lb/>
            the late uncle of the conqueror, and the present victory of Oleander.</p>
          <p>FOR Oleander and his youthful prime let some one, 0 ye <lb/>

            lesarchus, raise the festal song, the glorious recompense of <lb/>
            his toils, the reward both of his Isthmian victory, and <lb/>
            because that, in Nemea, he gained the victory in the contest.</p>
          <p>For whom I too, though grieved in soul, am bidden to <lb/>

          <p>But since we have been freed from mighty woes, let us <lb/>
            neither fall into a lack of crowns, nor do thou, my spirit, <lb/>
            cherish thy woes; but having ceased from unprofitable <lb/>
            griefs, let us sportively utter abroad some sweet strain even <lb/>
            after our calamity : since some deity hath turned aside from <lb/>
            us the stone of Tantalus that was hung over our head, <lb/>
            insufferable toil to Greece. But the passing away of my <lb/>
            fear has put an end to my grievous anxiety, and it is better <lb/>

            ind a man should cherish good hope.</p>
          <p>And it is the duty of one that hath been reared in seven- <lb/>
            gated Thebes to allot to Ægina before all else the choicest <lb/>
            gift of the Charites, because that from their sire were born <lb/>
            twin daughters, the youngest of the daughters of Asopus, <lb/>
            and they pleased Zeus lord of all. Who near Dirce of the fair <lb/>
            stream gave one to dwell as mistress of the city that loves <lb/>
            the car ;b and having brought thee, 0 Ægina, to the island <lb/>
            Œnopia, he lay with thee; where to his loud-thundering <lb/>
            sire thou didst bring forth divine Æacus the most wise of <lb/>
            all the dwellers upon earth, who used to bring to an end the <lb/>
            strifes even of the gods: his godlike sons and his warlike <lb/>
            sons’ sons excelled by their courage in conducting the din of <lb/>
            brazen mournful war, and they were temperate-minded and <lb/>
            sage of soul. This did the assemblies of the blessed ones <lb/>
            remember, when Zeus and bright Poseidon strove for the <lb/>
            nuptial tie of Thetis, either of them desiring that she should <lb/>
            be his fair bride ; for love possessed them.</p>
          <p>But the immortal understandings of the other gods accom­ <lb/>
            plished not for them that wedlock, when they heard the <lb/>
            voice of the oracles. For Themis, author of wise counsel, <lb/>
            said amongst them all, that it was fated that the ocean <lb/>
            goddess should bring forth for himc a lordly son more mighty <lb/>
            than his sire, who should wield in his hand another weapon <lb/>
            more powerful than the thunderbolt and the irresistible trident, <lb/>
            if she were united to Zeus or to the brothers of Zeus.—“ But <lb/>
            do you then cease this strife, and let her, having obtained <lb/>
            a mortal spouse, behold her son slain in war, like to Ares in <lb/>
            might, and in strength of feet like lightning. It is my <lb/>
            advice to give her as the honour of wedlock granted-by-the­ <lb/>
            gods to Peleus, son of Æacus, who is by report the most <lb/>
            pious of men that the plain of Iolcos contains. And let the <lb/>

          <p>Thus spoke the goddess addressing the sons of Cronus, <lb/>
            and they with their immortal eyebrows nodded assent, and <lb/>
            the fruit of her words did not fall away and perish. For <lb/>
            they say that along with them king Peleus had regard for <lb/>
            the espousal of Thetis. And soon did the mouths of the <lb/>
            wise point out to the ignorant the youthful valour of <lb/>
            Achilles ; who both stained with blood the vine-clad Mysian <lb/>
            plain, sprinkling it with the black blood of Telephus, and <lb/>
            bridged a return home for the Atridæ, and redeemed Helen, <lb/>
            having cut with his spear the nerves of Troy (which in times <lb/>
            past checked him as he marshalled on the plain the work of <lb/>
            homicidal battle), both the haughty might of Memnon and <lb/>
            Hector and other princes, to whom Achilles, warder of the <lb/>
            Æacidæ, disclosing the dwelling of Persephone,c showed <lb/>
            forth Ægina and his own descent. To him, not even when <lb/>
            dead, have songs been lacking, but near his funeral pyre and <lb/>
            tomb did the Heliconian maidens stand, and over him pour <lb/>
            forth the dirge with many a strain. This then was thought <lb/>
            befitting by the immortals, to consign a valiant hero, evei <lb/>
            when passed away, to the hymns of the goddesses.</p>
          <p>And this course now too is proper ;f and the car of the <lb/>
            Muses hastens on loudly to sing the memorial of the boxer <lb/>
            Nicocles. Honour him, therefore, who in the Isthmian game <lb/>
            lilts won the Doric parsley, since surely in times past he too <lb/>
            overcame the heroes who dwelt around him, driving them <lb/>
            before him with a hand that none could escape. Him the <lb/>
            offspring of his renowned uncles does not disgrace : let one <lb/>
            of his compeers weave a beauteous crown of myrtle for <lb/>
            Oleander in honour of his victory in the pancratium ; since <lb/>

          <p>The Index which I have compiled to the passages of <lb/>
            Pindar referred to in J elf's Greek Grammar will prove of <lb/>
            great use to the reader. It is a matter to me of much <lb/>
            regret that the whole of the foregoing translation had, already, <lb/>
            not only been written, but also printed, before the second <lb/>
            edition of Jelf appeared. Other errata, besides those noticed, <lb/>
            have no doubt escaped my eye, for which I beg the reader <lb/>
            to accept the excuse of my having had to work in the midst <lb/>
            of many other occupations and numerous interruptions. A <lb/>
            reference is earnestly recommended on every occasion to the <lb/>

            sitting as a spectator of the Olympic games. The same doctrine is sup­ <lb/>

            Down from the peg he hung the tuneful lyre.—Odyss. lib. viii. 67. </note><note type="footnote"> § There were three sorts of musical strains among the Greeks, viz., <lb/>
            the Dorian, the Lydian, and the Phrygian; of which the first was <lb/>
            animating and grand, the second soft and melting, and the third melan­ <lb/>

            of the youth Asopichus, addressed to the Graces ; and Dryden's softly <lb/>
            sweet in Lydian measures" will not be forgotten. The Phrygian strain <lb/>
            was employed, as Lucretius informs us, in the horrific solemnities of tit, <lb/>
            Mother of the Gods ; and Statius introduces it at the funeralof Arche­ <lb/>

            king of Sipylus in Lydia, being wonted in battle by Ilus, king of Troy, <lb/>

            harbour there, in his time, named after Tantalus, and a distinguishable <lb/>
            tomb. (Paus. lib. v. c. 13.) He mentions, also, a brazen chest in tne <lb/>
            temple of Diana Cordace at Olympia, in which the bones of Pelops were <lb/>
            preserved. The " plain by Pelops won" is the Elean territory, of Which, <lb/>

            annually their first-fruits to Apollo's temple, in the Prasian Borough in <lb/>
            Attica, by delivering them to the Arimaspians, by whom they were <lb/>
            handed to the Issedonians, by them to the Scythians, by them to the <lb/>
            Rinopeans, and from thence through Greece to the Athenians, who had <lb/>
            the honour of sending them to Delos. How the neighbours of the <lb/>
            ArimaRpians could have been supposed to dwell near the fountains of the <lb/>
            Danube, and at the same time north of Boreas, those only can conceive <lb/>
            who have noticed our author's extraordinary ignorance of geography. <lb/>
            This annual visit of Apollo, so often identified with the sun, to this <lb/>
            northern nation, had possibly its origin in the periodical movement <lb/>
            of that luminary to the northern tropic. In the same manner Ilithyia <lb/>
            or Lucina, as frequently confounded with Diana and the Moon, is said <lb/>
            to have come from the Hyperboreans to assist the labour of Latona.— <lb/>
            Paus. lib. i. c. 18. Apollo is described in the 8th Olympic Ode, stro. iii. <lb/>
            as driving his chariot to the Danube, and in the 10th Pythian Ode, <lb/>
            ep. iii. as being delighted with the barbarous solemnities of the Hyper­ <lb/>
            boreans. After all it will appear doubtful, when we come to the exploit <lb/>
            of Perseus related in the latter ode, whether Africa was not the resi­ <lb/>

            lie was the son of Œcleus, who is said by some to have been killed <lb/>
            before Troy in Hercules's war against Laomedon, but whose tomb <lb/>
            Pausanias saw near Megalopolis in Arcadia. Amphiaraiis predicted <lb/>
            future events by the art of interpreting dreams, of which Pausanias says <lb/>
            that he was the inventor, though Pliny ascribes that honour to Amphic­ <lb/>
            tyon. His acquisition of this faculty appears to have been supernatural; <lb/>
            for there was a house at Phliuns near Nemea, which the Phliasians <lb/>
            called the house of divination ; because Amphiaraüs, who was before un­ <lb/>
            gifted, obtained the power of prophecy by sleeping there a single night. <lb/>
            —Paus. lib. ii. c. 13. It seems clear that he was a proficient in this art <lb/>
            of oneirocrisy ; it being the practice after his apotheosis (for he <lb/>
            became a god) for his worshippers to sleep beside his altar in the pious <lb/>
            hope of a prophetic dream. There was, in the time of Pausanias, a <lb/>
            fountain and a temple named after him near Oropus, from whence he <lb/>
            was supposed to have ascended.—Paus. lib. i. c. 34. But both the one <lb/>
            and the other have entirely disappeared.—Dodw. Trav. vol. ii. 156. The <lb/>
            story of his being swallowed up with his chariot and horses was, <lb/>
            perhaps, not very ancient, as Homer only says of him that he did not <lb/>
            attain old age (Odyss. xv. 247), but perished at Thebes ; an expression <lb/>
            which seems to indicate a more ordinary death ; and Æschylus has made <lb/>
            him prophesy of himself, that he should be slain and buried in the <lb/>
            Theban territory,- <lb/>

            have stopped after he had been thrown out of it in the battle ; but he <lb/>

            that the roads near Olympia abounded with his statues ; and his altar <lb/>
            was at the entrance of the Stadium.-See Paus. lib. v. c. 14, where, as <lb/>
            in the second Pythian, he is called Enagonius, that is, the patron of the <lb/>
            Games. Being also the inventor of the lyre, and the god of agility, he <lb/>

            was an ancient river of Arcadia, said to be the daughter of Ladon, <lb/>
            another river of the same country celebrated for the excellence of its <lb/>
            water.—Paus. lib. viii. c. 20. She is said to have been wedded to <lb/>
            Asopus, a river of Bœotia, and that Thebè was the issue of the marriage. <lb/>
            In this allegorical genealogy is probably recorded the arrival of a colony <lb/>
            of Arcadians from the banks of the Metopb to the banks of the Asopus <lb/>
            in Bœotia, and the foundation or enlargement of the Theban city, thus <lb/>

            whether it is not probable that Pindar, by the epithet <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρθενίαν</foreign>, meant <lb/>
            the virgin Juno, in a passage which ascribes to his nation a Stymphalian <lb/>
            origin of remote antiquity ; rather than that he was referring to Mount <lb/>

            from Stymphalus, between Tegea and the Argolic gulph. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Bæotian boars. This name was given to the Boeotians to denote <lb/>

            inhabited by a race called the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὕαντες</foreign>, Huantes ; but that word might <lb/>
            have had the same origin. </note><note type="footnote">§ Mystic staff. The word <foreign xml:lang="grc">σκυταλη</foreign>, scutalè, which I have thus trans­ <lb/>
            lated, signifies a military staff in use among the Spartans for the purpose <lb/>
            of conveying secret orders to their general. It was a smooth cylinder <lb/>
            or truncheon, which was delivered to him at his departure from the city; <lb/>
            where another of the same size and shape was kept by the chief magi!!­ <lb/>
            trate. When the orders were required to be sent, a narrow band was <lb/>
            wound spirally round the latter from one end to the other, so that the sides <lb/>
            or edges of the band exactly coincided without any interval between <lb/>
            them, the whole surface of the staff being thus completely covered. <lb/>
            The orders were then written in straight lines longitudinally from end <lb/>
            to end across the spiral windings of the band, which was then taken off <lb/>
            and transmitted to the general; the staff round which it had been wound <lb/>
            remaining with the magistrate. The general who received the band had <lb/>
            only to wind it in the same manner round the corresponding staff in his <lb/>
            possession, by means of which the words and letters were again reunited <lb/>
            and arranged, and the orders, which the messenger could not decypher, <lb/>

            to the mythology of the ancients, our poet here personifies <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγγελία</foreign> <lb/>
            (which signifies a message, tiding, or report), and calls her the daughter <lb/>
            of Mercury. Heyne supposes that Iphion died after he had received <lb/>
            from Olympia the message or tidings of Alcimedon's victory, and that <lb/>
            Pindar therefore suggested that he would tell it to Callimachus. Who <lb/>
            these two persons were, or how related to Alcimedon, we are not <lb/>
            informed; some suppose that Iphion was his father, and Callimachus his <lb/>
            uncle; the reverse of which appears to me to be the more likely. That <lb/>
            Alcimedon's father was not alive, we may collect from the fourth strophe, <lb/>
            where the grandfather's (not the father's) joy at the victory is described. <lb/>
            I conceive, therefore, that Callimachus was the father, and Iphion the <lb/>
            uncle ; that the former died before the victory, and the latter between <lb/>
            the dates of the victory and the ode; which being so, I see much beauty <lb/>
            and spirit in supposing, that the uncle, having heard the tidings, woulo. <lb/>
            communicate them in the shades below to the father of the victor. <lb/>
            When it is recollected, that it was Mercury's office, not only to conduct <lb/>
            the souls of mortals to the shades, but also to superintend and influence <lb/>
            the Games (see Olymp. ode vi. ep. v. and Pyth. ode ii. antistro. i.) and <lb/>
            therefore to be the author of the tidings or reports of victory, circum­ <lb/>
            stances familiar to the Greek reader, we can judge of the effect and <lb/>
            beauty of this little allegory. Fame is not quite the word, but I cannot <lb/>
            find a better for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγγελία</foreign>; a difficulty which the other translators have <lb/>

            severity, that he banged himself. He flourished about three hundred <lb/>
            years before Pindar, and was skilled in the art of singing to the lyre, as <lb/>
            Theocritus informs us:— <lb/>

            triple; but as it is said also to have been three times sung for each <lb/>
            victor, once immediately after the victory, again in the Gymnasium, <lb/>

            That held within the unmingled draught divine.—Odyss. ii. 1. 341. <lb/>
            And, therefore, our author puts in his claim of praise for modern <lb/>
            (i. e. his own) poetry, while he joins the ancient Bard in the commenda­ <lb/>
            tion of old wine. The union of wine and flowers in this passage <lb/>
            (though perhaps an involuntary association) was probably suggested to <lb/>
            the poet by the practice which the ancients had, of crowning their <lb/>
            wine-vessels and themselves with garlands at the convivial table. See <lb/>
            Whiter's Specimen of a Commentary on Shakspeare ; where this principle <lb/>
            of association is skilfully illustrated. </note> <note type="footnote"> † Dames that mixed, &amp;c. Heyne endeavours to explain this difficult <lb/>
            passage by supposing that Pindar had some legend of a line of Locrian <lb/>
            kings before Deucalion, who were sprung from Jupiter and a female <lb/>
            descendant of Iäpetus. But if this were so, then Deucalion would have <lb/>
            been a Locrian king; whereas it is clear from the conclusion of the <lb/>
            following strophe, that Pindar considers Opus as the founder or first <lb/>
            king of the Locrian city and state. The difficulty, however, will be <lb/>
            removed by following the old Scholiast (not always the safest guide), <lb/>
            who interprets <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰορα̃ν</foreign> not filiarum, daughters, but amasiarum, mistresses <lb/>
            (see Pyth. ode iii. ep. ii.), and supposes the plural to have been used for <lb/>
            the singular, so that the mistresses of Saturn's most potent sons means <lb/>
            the mistress of Saturn's most potent son, i. e. Protogeneia and Jupiter, <lb/>
            whose story is related in the next strophe. In this way it will appear <lb/>
            that the Locrian kings were descended from Iäpetus through Pro­ <lb/>
            togeneia. (the daughter of Deucalion, the grandson of Iäpetus), and of <lb/>
            course from the mistress of Jupiter, which Protogeneia was. The word <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρὶν</foreign>, which begins the strophe, must of course be construed not ante­ <lb/>
            quàm, but anteà, or, as we say, "once upcu a time," heretofore. </note></p><pb n="225"/>

            of their death is this:—Augeas, king of the Epéans or Eléans, who was <lb/>
            immensely rich in flocks and herds, had engaged Hercules to cleanse his <lb/>
            stalls ; which service he performed by turning a river through them, and <lb/>

            Augeas, and destroyed Hercules' army, as stated in the text; in return <lb/>
            for which he laid in wait for them, and slew them as they were coming <lb/>

            Pausanias saw their monuments near the Temple of Minerva.—Paus, <lb/>

            belted with six terraces rising above each other. Homer describes it as <lb/>

            part of it, or whether the grove was within, and a part only of <lb/>
            the Altis, or only a plantation round the Hippodrome. Pausanias un­ <lb/>

            says nothing of any grove, or tree except the Callistephanus (the wild <lb/>

            us in direct terms whether the Stadium and Hippodrome were within the <lb/>
            Altis or without; although it seems from one passage at least that the <lb/>
            Hippodrome was without (Paus. lib. v. c. 15). If the Altis had any <lb/>
            visible boundary, it is to be collected from this writer, that it was not a <lb/>
            belt of trees, but a wall (lib. v. cc. 24, 25) : neither does be allude to any <lb/>
            plantation round the Hippodrome. We are, however, told by Pindar in <lb/>
            the Olymp. ode iii. stro. ii. iii., that, there being no trees at Olympia, <lb/>
            Hercules obtained the wild olive from the Hyperboreans, to form the <lb/>
            Grove of Jupiter, and to plant it round the Hippodrome. Now if the <lb/>

            plantation round the Hippodrome, it could not have been the Altis, <lb/>
            which, as far as we can gather from Pausanias, was surrounded by a wall. <lb/>
            It is more probable that this sacred grove surrounded the old temple of <lb/>
            Olympian Jupiter before the erection, of the new one in the time of <lb/>
            Phidias, than that it occupied or surrounded the whole Altis ; which <lb/>
            contained within it, in addition to that temple, the temples of Juno <lb/>
            and of Cybelè, the Pelopion, the Prytanasum, the Proedria, the Leoni­ <lb/>
            dæum, the Pæcilè or Painted Cloister, seven Treasuries, the Hippodamion <lb/>
            occupying an acre of ground, and was in short so large, that the battle <lb/>
            between the Spartans and Eleians was fought within it.—Paus. lib. v. <lb/>
            and vi. c. 2. In the passage, on which this note is written, Pindar uses <lb/>
            both the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">α̉λσος</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">α̉λσος</foreign>, apparently to denote two different <lb/>
            things, the former not signifying merely a sacred inclosure, but a grove <lb/>
            of trees. Yet Pausanias tells us, that having perverted the name, they <lb/>
            had called the sacred <foreign xml:lang="grc">α̉λσος</foreign> of Jupiter <foreign xml:lang="grc">α̉λτις</foreign>, from antiquity : he adds, <lb/>
            however, that by Pindar the whole place (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ χωρἰον</foreign>) is named "<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αλτις</foreign> <lb/>
            (lib. v. c. 10); which Damm says, not stating his authority, was in the <lb/>
            Eleian language the same as <foreign xml:lang="grc">α̉λσος</foreign>. The word is not in Hesychius, or <lb/>
            in the old edition of H. Stephens's Thesaurus, though in Valpy's new <lb/>
            edition, it is said to be the same as <foreign xml:lang="grc">α̉λσος</foreign>. Robert Stephens renders i+ <lb/>
            a grove ; Benedict, a temple ; Damm, contrary to all authority, the name <lb/>
            of the Temple of Jupiter: and Schmidius and Heyne, simply Altis, i. e. <lb/>

            Cephisus, but near the lake Cephisis, called afterwards Copais. See <lb/>

            Graces the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τέμενος</foreign> of Cephisis. The temple at Orchomenus dedicated <lb/>
            to these goddesses was built by Eteocles, an ancient king of that city, <lb/>
            where (as Dr. Clarke shows from the inscriptions, which he had the <lb/>
            good fortune to discover in a monastery there, Trav. vol. iv. p. 156) <lb/>
            public games in honour of them, called Charitesia, were celebrated, of <lb/>
            which neither Potter nor any other writer has made mention. There <lb/>
            was a temple of the Graces also at Olympia, containing their three <lb/>
            statues made of gilded wood, with the faces and the feet of marble, one <lb/>
            of them holding a rose, and another a myrtle (plants sacred to Venus). <lb/>

            were descended.—Pyth. ode iv. ep. iii., and Apoll. Rhod. lib. i. 229. <lb/>
            Minyas was famous for his wealth, and for a treasury which he erected, <lb/>
            called by Pausanias one of the wonders of Greece, and compared by him <lb/>
            as such to the Pyramids of Egypt. It was a circular building of stone, <lb/>
            ending in a top not very pointed, with a keystone that held the mass <lb/>
            together.—Paus. lib. ix. cc. 36, 38. It existed in the second century, <lb/>
            and there are some remains of it at this day.—Dodw. Trav. vol. i. <lb/>

            import that the covering of this ancient edifice was a dome. The wealth <lb/>
            of Orchomenus, to which Thebes was once tributary, is alluded to by <lb/>
            Homer as proverbial in the days of Achilles.—Il. ix. 1. 381. He also <lb/>

            Catana, and peopled it with a numerous colony from the Peloponnese <lb/>
            and elsewhere ; at the same time giving it the name of AEtna, from the <lb/>
            adjacent mountain, for which act, unjust as it appears to us, he expected <lb/>
            heroic honours at his death.— Diod. Sic. lib. xi. c. 49. With this clue <lb/>
            the reader will perceive with how much skill the poet has selected the <lb/>
            various flattering topics which compose this magnificent ode. This vic­ <lb/>
            tory was obtained in the 29th Pythiad, corresponding with the third <lb/>

            victory over the Carthaginians at Himera, he prepared to assist the <lb/>
            Greeks against the Persians; but being informed of the battle of Salt­ <lb/>

            in arms to an assembly, at which he himself appeared unarmed, and <lb/>
            gave them an account of his past conduct, with which they were so gra­ <lb/>

            friend of Hercules, who gave him his arrows at his death, without which <lb/>
            the Delphic Oracle pronounced that Troy could not be taken. He <lb/>
            commanded seven ships in the Trojan war, but receiving from ona of <lb/>
            the arrows a wound in his foot, which was thought incurable, remained <lb/>
            at Lemnos till the last year of the war ; when the Grecian chiefs, having <lb/>
            been instructed by the oracle, brought him from Lemnos to the Trojau <lb/>
            plain, where he was cured by Machaon, and contributed to the capture <lb/>
            of that city.—Il. ii. 718 ; Soph. Philoct.; Ov. Met. xiii. 401. Our poet <lb/>
            has likened Hiero to Pbiloctetes, whom he resembled not in the nature <lb/>
            of his malady, which was the stone, but in the circumstance of his <lb/>
            having, when afflicted with it, gone into the field of battle, and over­ <lb/>
            come the enemy. The allusion to Philoctetes still appears remote ; it <lb/>
            seems to me, however, that it may be thus accounted for. Anaxilaüs, <lb/>
            king of the Rhegians, situated at the foot of Italy, having (as the Scho­ <lb/>
            liast tells us) threatened to attack the Locrians, the latter applied to <lb/>
            Hiero, by whose interference (as we learn from the Pythian ode ii. <lb/>
            p. i.), the project was abandoned. To this circumstance Pindar alludes <lb/>
            in the next two lines, and was thereby reminded of Philoctetes ; for <lb/>
            these Locrians, according to Virgil, had settled in Calabria; where <lb/>
            Philoctetes landed after the fall of Troy, and built the little city of <lb/>
            Petilia. We shall remember that the prophet Helenus, being consulted <lb/>
            by AEneas as to his future course, enjoins him to avoid the coast of Italy <lb/>
            opposite Epirus, and gives the following reasons :— <lb/>
            Shun the dread walls with Greeks malignant fill'd ; <lb/>
            Narycia’s ramparts there the Locrians build; <lb/>

            chariots, landed at Panormus, refreshed his men, repaired his fleet, and <lb/>
            proceeded, the latter accompanying him, to the siege of Himera. He <lb/>
            there encamped his land-forces, drew his long ships on shore, and forti­ <lb/>
            fied them with a deep ditch and a wooden rampart, and commenced <lb/>
            hostilities against the town. Upon this, Theron, the governor of <lb/>
            Himera, sent in his alarm to Gelon, who marched immediately by land <lb/>
            to his assistance with five thousand horse and fifty thousand foot ; and by <lb/>
            an admirable stratagem, of which the historian gives a most interesting <lb/>
            account, contrived to send a division of his horse, pretending to be Seli­ <lb/>
            nuntian allies, within the wooden rampart of the enemy, surprised and <lb/>

            Carthaginians, except some who, crowding into twenty of the long <lb/>
            ships, that could not be drawn on shore, made their escape and foun­ <lb/>
            dered in a storm. It is the battle of Himera, and that only, which <lb/>
            Pindar has compared to those of Salamis and Platæa; conformably <lb/>

            Ortygia, each connected with Diana ; in one of which she is stated by <lb/>
            different authors to have been born. The first of these was the Isle of <lb/>
            Delos, called anciently Ortygia, as in Virgil: Linquimus Ortygiæ portus <lb/>
            (En. iii. 124) ; the second was a beautiful grove, near the Temple of <lb/>
            Ephesus, where the goddess was said to have been born of Latona, and <lb/>
            to have been nursed by Ortygia, from whom the grove was named.- <lb/>
            Stra. lib. xiv. 947, 948. Callimachus refers Apollo's nativity to Delos, <lb/>
            but says nothing of Diana's. Homer describes Latona as having pro­ <lb/>
            duced Diana and Apollo, <lb/>
            Her in Ortygia, him in rocky Delos.—Hymn. Apol. 14. <lb/>
            From which passage it is plain that Homer did not consider Delos as the <lb/>
            birthplace of Diana ; but whether he meant the Ephesian or Syracusian <lb/>
            Ortygia, does not appear. The goddess had certainly a temple in the <lb/>
            latter place, which being called in the first Nemean Ode <foreign xml:lang="grc">δέμνιον</foreign> <lb/>
            ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αρτέμιδος</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δάλου κασιγνήτα</foreign>, the bed of Diana, and the sister of <lb/>
            Delos (anciently Ortygia), was, as the Scholiast on that passage says, re­ <lb/>

            by Pindar annexing in his manner the fable to the name. </note><note type="footnote"> t At the entrance to the Olympic Stadium there was an altar to <lb/>

            with Crissa mentioned by Homer (Il. ii. 520), in whose works the name <lb/>

            and her son Perseus in a frail bark, in which they were carried to the <lb/>
            island of Seriphos, one of the Cyclades. Polydectes, the king of that <lb/>
            island, brought him up ; but becoming afraid of him, and determining to <lb/>
            disgrace him, he invited all his friends to a sumptuous feast, at which <lb/>
            it was requisite that each of the guests should present the monarch <lb/>
            with a beautiful horse. Perseus, who was of the number invited, and <lb/>
            unable to make the expected present, not willing to be outdone, told <lb/>
            the king that he would bring him the head of Medusa, the Gorgon. <lb/>
            The offer was accepted, in the hopes that it would end in his death. <lb/>
            But Perseus, having been successful, returned with the head at the <lb/>
            moment when Polydectes was threatening violence to his mother. He <lb/>
            presented the head, which had the power of turning every one that <lb/>
            lookedon it into stone, to Polydectes and his associates, who became <lb/>

            thiaca, sub init. And the Corinthians were well known in poetry <lb/>
            under that name.—Hom. 11., bk. vi. 1. 152; Ovid, Epis. Medea Jasoni, <lb/>
            27. There were other cities of the name of Ephyra ; one of them <lb/>
            a city of Thesprotia, in Epirus, another in Elis, another in AEtolia. <lb/>
            The Benedictine paraphrase, however, interprets the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">Έφυραιωι</foreign>’, <lb/>
            as meaning the Thessalians, to whose country Hippocleas, the subject <lb/>
            of this ode, belonged. The Scholiast says that the Ephyræans were a <lb/>
            tribe among the Thossalians: that Cranon, a city of Thessaly, was <lb/>
            anciently called Ephyré, and that its name was changed to Cranon <lb/>
            from its king of that name, who was one of the suitors of Hippo­ <lb/>
            damia, killed by Œnomäus, her father. It is very probable that <lb/>
            Hippocleas, who was a Thessalian, belonged to the Ephyræan tribe, a-­ <lb/>
            it is a common practice with Pinda to introduce the name of the <lb/>
            victor's tribe. </note> <pb n="337"/>

            not uncommon in many parts of the world. Any piece of black pebble, <lb/>
            or flint, will answer the purpose of the Lapis Lydius; but the black <lb/>
            rough marble and basaltes are the best. The method of using the <lb/>
            stone is this: on a number of little bars of gold, silver, and copper, <lb/>
            combined together in all manner of different proportions, the propor­ <lb/>
            tions of each are marked. The piece of metal to be assayed is rubbed <lb/>
            on the stone, and then the needle or bar which is supposed to be <lb/>
            the nearest to it in composition : that bar which produces the colour <lb/>
            exactly corresponding with that of the metal to be assayed, indicates its <lb/>
            composition, and the quantity of alloy which it contains. <lb/>

            For the rich lay, that wakes the lyre, <lb/>
            And waits on Virtue's steps, weaving the wreath she earns : <note type="footnote"> * Ægina’s Dorian isle. Ægina, formerly CEnopia, received its name <lb/>
            from Ægina, the daughter of Asopus. She married Actor, the son of <lb/>
            Myrmidon ; but of her son, Æacus, the king of CEnopia, Jupiter is said <lb/>
            to have been the father. Æacus was the father of Telamon and Peleus, <lb/>
            and Peleus was the father of Achilles: hence the poet takes occasion to <lb/>
            commemorate the exploits of all three in the course of this ode. <lb/>
            Pausanias (book ii.) says that the original inhabitants of the island <lb/>
            were produced by Jupiter from the earth; that afterwards some Argives <lb/>
            having settled there, and mixed themselves with the natives, taught <lb/>
            them the Dorian language and customs, which became prevalent <lb/>
            throughout the island. Strabo (book viii.) says that it was colonized by <lb/>
            Argives, Cretans, Epidaurians, and Dorians. </note><note type="footnote"> ✝Old Asopus' banks. There were several rivers of this name, in Thes­ <lb/>

            is a river of Peloponnesus, passing by Sicyon, and therefore not far from <lb/>
            the seat of the Nemean Games. There is probably also an allusion to <lb/>
            Asopus, the father of the nymph Ægina, who gave his name to this <lb/>
            river, and is supposed to be listening, therefore, to his own daughter’s <lb/>

            Mount Pelion. It was the birth-place and patrimony of Jason, the SOil <lb/>
            of Æson. The occasion of the taking Iolcus by Peleus was as follows: <lb/>
            —Astydamia, or Hippolyte, the wife of Acastus, the son of Pelias, who <lb/>
            usurped the throne of Æson, fell in love with Peleus while in banish­ <lb/>
            ment at the court of her husband. Peleus, however, rejecting her ad­ <lb/>
            dresses, she accused him to Acastus of attempts upon her virtue. The <lb/>
            monarch, listening to the accusation of his wife, ordered his officers to <lb/>
            conduct him to Mount Pelion, under pretence of a hunting-party, and <lb/>
            there to tie him to a tree, that he might become the prey of wild beasts. <lb/>
            Having escaped from thence by the assistance of Chiron, Peleus assem­ <lb/>
            bled his friends, forcibly took Iolcus, deposed Acastus, and put Astyda­ <lb/>
            mia to death. Among the friends who assisted him, however, were <lb/>
            Jason, and the Tyndaridæ, according to the relation of Pherecydes, as <lb/>

            the most ancient in Greece, and in the earliest times was of so great <lb/>
            importance, as to give its name to the whole of Peloponnesus. It <lb/>
            ceased, however, so early as B. C. 1088, and of its history little is known <lb/>
            except the names of its kings. The story here alluded to is somewhat <lb/>
            variously told—Herodotus, and Mensechmus according to the Scholiast, <lb/>
            making Adrastus to be the grandson, and others calling him the son-in- <lb/>
            law of Polybus, whose throne he inherited in Sicyon. Dieutychidas <lb/>
            gives the most detailed account, as found in the Scholiast. He relates <lb/>
            that the daughters of Prætus, king of Argos, being insane, Melanippus <lb/>
            the soothsayer undertook to cure them on receiving two-thirds of the <lb/>
            kingdom. This he performed, and the half of his share he gave to his <lb/>
            brother Bias, so that the whole kingdom was divided into three parts, <lb/>
            between the descendants of Melanippus, Bias, and Prætus. Amphia­ <lb/>
            räus was the descendant of Melanippus, who, quarrelling with Taläus, <lb/>
            the son of Bias, and father of Adrastus, put him to death. Adrastus <lb/>
            fled to Sicyon, where he married the daughter of Polybus. So that <lb/>
            Adrastus and his brothers, the sons of Taläus, ceased to reign in Argos. <lb/>
            Adrastus having succeeded to the throne of Polybus, who died without <lb/>
            an heir, instead of harbouring his resentinent, entered into terms with <lb/>
            Amphiaräus, and cemented their friendship by giving him his sister <lb/>
            Eriphyle in marriage, as the poet proceeds to relate. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2C 2 </note> <pb n="388"/>

            is here, as in Pythian ode vi. antis. i., put for the Pythian games, on <lb/>
            account of its proximity. Dr. Clarke describes it as a situation of the <lb/>
            most romantic beauty. Strabo, from this circumstance, calls the dis­ <lb/>
            trict round it <foreign xml:lang="grc">Εὔδαιμον</foreign>, or the Happy. The riches and luxury of <lb/>
            the people inflaming their arrogance, the town was razed by a <lb/>
            decree of the oracle, which had been consulted by the Amphictyons, <lb/>
            and it has long been a doubt what was its exact situation. The latest <lb/>
            and best opinion seems to be, that Cirrha was the port, and Crissa the <lb/>
            town adjoining it, which reconciles those who nave confounded them <lb/>
