          <p>THE object aimed at in this Translation is, as the <lb/>
            title-page sets forth, to render Plato's text as nearly <lb/>
            as possible word for word into English, and it is <lb/>
            therefore not intended specially for English readers. <lb/>
            On the contrary, it is intended principally for stu- <lb/>
            dents and scholars, for those who are learning or <lb/>
            have learnt to compare the structure and resources of <lb/>
            the Greek and the English language, and the several <lb/>
            modes of expression which the habits of thought pre- <lb/>
            vailing in times and places so far removed from one <lb/>
            another have stamped upon their respective idioms. <lb/>
            Those who have done so are the only fair judges of <lb/>
            such an attempt, and will be the first to make the <lb/>
            requisite allowance for the defects and shortcomings <lb/>
            which will most assuredly be found in this transla- <lb/>
            tion. My endeavour has been not only to convey <lb/>
            the spirit and freedom, which of course must be the <lb/>
            aim of every translator, but also as far as possible to <lb/>
            preserve the form of the original language; and I <lb/>
            have done my best to hold a middle course between <lb/>
            the pedantic and servile adherence to the letter by <lb/>
             <pb n="VI"/>
            which grace case and English grammar arc alike <lb/>
            sacrificed, and the looseness of a paraphrase, which <lb/>
            may indeed faithfully reproduce the thoughts of the <lb/>
            writer, but must needs fail to give any idea of the <lb/>
            dress in which those thoughts are clothed. It seems <lb/>
            to me that the true spirit of an author can be con- <lb/>
            veyed only in his own words, that is, in a literal <lb/>
            translation; and this view is I think supported by <lb/>
            the fact that all those translations which are gene- <lb/>
            rally recognised as the best are literal; I need go no <lb/>
            further than our English version of the Bible for an <lb/>
            instance in support of this assertion. Of the great, <lb/>
            perhaps insuperable, difficulties that stand in the way <lb/>
            of any such attempt none can be better aware than <lb/>
            myself: still this union of the letter with the spirit is <lb/>
            and must be, the ideal of a perfect translation, and <lb/>
            as such should always be kept in view by any one <lb/>
            who attempts faithfully to represent any work of <lb/>
            literature in the idiom of a foreign language; but still <lb/>
            more when the interest of that work depends, as in <lb/>
            most of the Platonic dialogues, in no slight degree <lb/>
            upon the external form and graces of style. The <lb/>
            difficulty of the task of translating is of course in- <lb/>
            creased in proportion to the distance of the age and <lb/>
            country in which the work was composed from those <lb/>
            in which it is invested with its new dress. The <lb/>
            circumstances and associations amongst which the <lb/>
            Greeks lived, and which, impressed their distinctive <lb/>
            character upon their modes of thought and expres- <lb/>
             <pb n="VII"/>
            sion, are so entirely remote from those which prevail <lb/>
            in this England of the nineteenth century that a mo- <lb/>
            dern translator cannot fail to be constantly at a loss for <lb/>
            an exact equivalent in his own language for the tech- <lb/>
            nical terms, for example, the metaphor, the proverb, <lb/>
            the allusion, the distinctions, the turns of phrase, <lb/>
            which were current and familiar two thousand years <lb/>
            ago. Hardest of all is the task of doing justice to <lb/>
            the language of a subtle as well as imaginative <lb/>
            writer like Plato; of rendering adequately the grace- <lb/>
            ful flow of his natural and easy dialogue; of express- <lb/>
            ing in simple and yet appropriate terms the nice <lb/>
            distinctions, the rigorous and systematic, often ab- <lb/>
            struse, trains of reasoning which yet are made to <lb/>
            follow the turns of a lively conversation, and never <lb/>
            except in his later dialogues take a formal and di- <lb/>
            dactic shape; of worthily representing the playful <lb/>
            humour, the happy and ingenious phrase, the bril- <lb/>
            liant metaphor, the sly stroke of satire, the burst of <lb/>
            eloquence, the sally of passion, the indignant invec- <lb/>
            tive, or the lofty flight of poetical imagery: and yet <lb/>
            all these have to be in their turn encountered by one <lb/>
            who undertakes to translate Plato.</p>
          <p>One of the most marked characteristics of Plato's <lb/>
            earlier and more dramatic dialogues, and one that I <lb/>
            have been most anxious to preserve, is the perfect <lb/>
            simplicity ease and familiarity with which the ideas <lb/>
            are expressed and the conversation carried on: here <lb/>
            there are no laboured antitheses, no balanced clauses, <lb/>
             <pb n="VIII"/>
            no artificially constructed periods 1, no pompous <lb/>
            phrases, no technical terms of science or philosophy; <lb/>
            all the grace is unstudied and the harmony natural. <lb/>
            It seems to me that this unartificial character has <lb/>
            been occasionally in some degree overlooked in more <lb/>
            than one of the most approved, and otherwise most <lb/>
            excellent, of the recent English versions of Plato. <lb/>
            Translators in turning their phrases and rounding <lb/>
            their periods are constantly liable to lose sight of the <lb/>
            unstudied and simple graces which charm us in the <lb/>
            original, and to convey to their version a certain <lb/>
            appearance of stifness and constraint altogether alien <lb/>
            from the unrestrained freedom of the Platonic style. <lb/>
            It is quite possible to translate Plato too neatly. In <lb/>
            endeavouring to avoid this error I have myself as <lb/>
            far as possible eschewed the use of all long and tech- <lb/>
            nical words, formal and set phrases, and elaborately <lb/>
            turned periods, and have been content, as far as I <lb/>
            could manage it, to let Plato speak in his own man- <lb/>
            ner, as well as in his own language. With this view <lb/>
            likewise I have sometimes preserved even the ana- <lb/>
            colutha, and always as far as I could retained the <lb/>
            same order of the words as that in which Plato wrote <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>One of the most prominent and striking difficul- <lb/>
            ties which a translator of this author has to overcome <note type="footnote"> 1 Plato's style in respect of the structure of his sentences-they are <lb/>
            hardly to be called regular periods-is well described by Dissen, in the <lb/>
            Essay De Structura Periodorum, prefixed to his edition of Demosth. de <lb/>
            Cm'on. pp. lxx-lxxv. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="IX"/>
            in the attempt to impart simplicity and freedom to <lb/>
            his version lies in the treatment of the Greek par- <lb/>
            ticles. These, singly and in endless combinations, <lb/>
            are so numerous, the shades of meaning conveyed <lb/>
            by them are so fine and delicate, often by their sub- <lb/>
            tlety escaping detection, always difficult to render; <lb/>
            they have so few equivalents in our own language, <lb/>
            and many of these awkward and cumbrous words, <lb/>
            which thrust themselves forward and force them- <lb/>
            selves unduly upon our notice-whereas in the <lb/>
            Greek those which most frequently occur are little <lb/>
            creatures of no more than two or three, or at the <lb/>
            most four, letters1, occupy little space and attract <lb/>
            little attention to themselves-that they throw an <lb/>
            endless series of traps and stumblingblocks in the <lb/>
            way of a translator who is bent upon expressing <lb/>
            them, as perplexing and provoking as they are un- <lb/>
            avoidable. The simplest and most usual mode of <lb/>
            dealing with these particles is to omit them alto- <lb/>
            gether. Here however I must make a special ex- <lb/>
            ception in the case of Schleiermacher, who carrying <lb/>
            the literal and rigorous exactness by which his work <lb/>
            is characterised down to these minute particulars <lb/>
            conscientiously translates them all: though how far <lb/>
            the German substitutes actually correspond to the <lb/>
            Greek originals no foreigner probably is competent <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέν δέ</foreign> ye <foreign xml:lang="grc">γάρ που ποι πως</foreign> TOt <foreign xml:lang="grc">δή αὖ ἂρα οὖνμήν ἁλλά ποτε</foreign> with their <lb/>
            various combinations make up pretty nearly the entire list of the par- <lb/>
            ticles in common use in a Greek dialogue. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="X"/>
            to decide. If I might venture to express my own <lb/>
            opinion upon the point, I should say that in this as <lb/>
            in other respects his version is rather over dry and <lb/>
            formal. But in omitting these particles we sacrifice <lb/>
            in a great measure the expression, so to call it, of <lb/>
            the dialogue. It is by these in a great degree that <lb/>
            the irony the insinuation the sneer, modesty delicacy <lb/>
            reserve hesitation diffidence vehemence resolution <lb/>
            positive assertion contempt indignation derision, and <lb/>
            numberless other shades and refinements of thought <lb/>
            feeling and character are conveyed, or at any rate <lb/>
            aided and heightened; they give point to an obser- <lb/>
            vation and connection to an argument: they are the <lb/>
            light shades and delicate touches of the picture— <lb/>
            like the play of features in the actor-hard to catch, <lb/>
            easy to overlook or misapprehend, but essential no <lb/>
            less to the harmony and finish, the expression and <lb/>
            character of the performance. I have therefore never <lb/>
            designedly omitted any one of them, except in the <lb/>
            few cases where it seemed that such omission would <lb/>
            more faithfully represent the original than their in- <lb/>
            sertion 1; and in so doing have often I fear run the <lb/>
            risk of encumbering and impeding Plato's lively nar- <lb/>
            rative, smart cut and thrust dialectics, or easy <lb/>
            conversation, with a number of disproportionately <lb/>
            lengthy words-or more commonly phrases, for long <note type="footnote"> 1 The case of the particle yap, when it occurs as introductory to a <lb/>
            narrative, is one of these. Schleiermacher always renders this by näm- <lb/>
            lich 'that is to say, as follows': but I doubt if we have in our language <lb/>
            anything exactly corresponding either to the one or the other. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="XI"/>
            words I have always done my best to avoid-which <lb/>
            often must be employed in default of any others in <lb/>
            our own language capable of adequately expressing <lb/>
            the same meaning with greater conciseness.</p>
          <p>Another error to be carefully avoided by a trans- <lb/>
            lator who desires to adhere faithfully to the simplicity <lb/>
            and freedom of the Platonic style is the use of tech- <lb/>
            nical terms to convey the doctrines and conceptions <lb/>
            of philosophy. One of the most striking peculiarities <lb/>
            of Plato's philosophical writings which distinguishes <lb/>
            them in a very marked manner from those of his <lb/>
            successors is the almost entire absence of any scien- <lb/>
            tific terminology: with the exception of one or two <lb/>
            peculiar terms such as <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἶδος</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">ίδέα</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">διαλεκτική</foreign>, and <lb/>
            the special appropriation of <foreign xml:lang="grc">διάνοια</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">θυμοειδές</foreign> in the <lb/>
            Republic, and possibly one or two others, Plato's <lb/>
            philosophy is absolutely devoid of any technical <lb/>
            phraseology. This is no doubt in a great measure <lb/>
            due, and especially in the earlier dialogues such as <lb/>
            Gorgias, to the conversational and dramatic form <lb/>
            into which he has chosen to throw the greater part <lb/>
            of his writings, and also to the fact that in the de- <lb/>
            partments of mental and moral philosophy which he <lb/>
            especially cultivated there was no terminology sum- <lb/>
            ciently established and popular to be suited to his <lb/>
            purpose; and partly also I should suppose from what <lb/>
            he says in the Phædrus and elsewhere to a dislike <lb/>
            and suspicion of technical as well as all other pompous <lb/>
            phrases, as unable to ' give an account of themselves,' <lb/>
             <pb n="XII"/>
            and without a detailed explanation and modification <lb/>
            according to circumstances likely only to mislead and <lb/>
            confuse, to pass off fallacies under cover of wisdom. <lb/>
            That this may be, and indeed often is, actually the <lb/>
            effect of them, will hardly I believe be denied by any <lb/>
            one who has ever read even a few pages of any <lb/>
            modern German philosophical work: nor do I think <lb/>
            that the harsh and ill-sounding terminology of the <lb/>
            Stoics, or even, may I say? of Aristotle, contributes <lb/>
            in any degree to render their systems more intelli- <lb/>
            gible. But whatever the reason may be, the fact at <lb/>
            all events is that the stock of words and phrases by <lb/>
            which Plato carries on his arguments, and arrives at <lb/>
            his philosophical conclusions is borrowed almost <lb/>
            entirely from the commonest language of common <lb/>
            life, and the translator is therefore bound on his <lb/>
            part to abstain as far as possible from all tech- <lb/>
            nical terms, though they may seem perchance to <lb/>
            express the same ideas more neatly and compactly, <lb/>
            however authority may have sanctioned and sub- <lb/>
            sequent usage familiarised us with them.</p>
          <p>I may here just notice two other classes of expres- <lb/>
            sion which offer some difficulty—trifling compared <lb/>
            with the preceding-in a literal translation of Plato, <lb/>
            namely the complimentary formulas and the oaths ; <lb/>
            these though of comparatively slight importance will <lb/>
            still often be found somewhat troublesome and im- <lb/>
            practicable. In regard of the former, which in <lb/>
            Plato's text are constantly making their appearance <lb/>
             <pb n="XIII"/>
            where they seem least wanted, our English stock of <lb/>
            current and familiar expressions of this kind-titles <lb/>
            always excepted—is at the present day very low <lb/>
            indeed, and greatly reduced from what it was in the <lb/>
            more ceremonious days of our forefathers. Even <lb/>
            'fair Sir' has no longer a familiar sound in our <lb/>
            ordinary speech, and ' dear Sir ' ' good Sir' ' worthy <lb/>
            Sir' 'my dear fellow', or the same adjectives with <lb/>
            'friend', and perhaps one or two more, fill up the <lb/>
            list of those which would nowadays be admitted on <lb/>
            any terms into a friendly conversation; and even <lb/>
            these are by no means adequate representations of <lb/>
            the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦ γεννα</foreign>ȋ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ε, ὦ κάλλιστε, ὦἂριστε, ὦ μακάριε, ὦ βέλτιστε, <lb/>
            ὦ δαιμόνιε, ὦ θαυμάσιε, ὦφίλτατε</foreign> and the rest, which <lb/>
            occur with such provoking frequency in Socrates' <lb/>
            courteous addresses. As however these phrases so <lb/>
            seldom present themselves in an English dialogue, <lb/>

            ble the general meaning or spirit of the passage in <lb/>
            which they are found, the motives for retaining and <lb/>
            making the best of them are by no means so strong as <lb/>
            they have been shown to be in the case of the parti- <lb/>
            cles, indeed it may be said that the omission of them <lb/>
            is justifiable or perhaps even advisable, when by <lb/>
            their introduction the translation would assume an <lb/>
            antiquated or unfamiliar aspect.</p>
          <p>Our modern stock of oaths recognised nowadays as <lb/>

            we still believed in saints sufficiently to swear by them, <lb/>
            Our Lady or St George or St Sophia might perhaps <lb/>
            be allowed to take the place of "<foreign xml:lang="grc">Πρα</foreign> or "<foreign xml:lang="grc">Λρης</foreign> or '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Λθηνα̑</foreign> <lb/>
            in the Greek adjurations; the chaste "<foreign xml:lang="grc">Λρτεμις</foreign> might <lb/>
            be represented by one of the virgin martyrs; and St <lb/>
            Sebastian with his juvenile and faultless figure might <lb/>
            do duty for the beardless Apollo-unless indeed the <lb/>
            somewhat important difference between the two, that <lb/>
            the one was a discharger the other a mere recipient of <lb/>
            arrows, the one an archer the other only a mark, were <lb/>
            thought to disqualify him for sustaining such a part: <lb/>
            but in these Protestant times such a resource is no <lb/>
            longer available. As to the commoner forms of <lb/>
            adjuration which are of such constant occurrence, <foreign xml:lang="grc">νὴ <lb/>
            Δία, μὰ Δία, νὴ τοὺς θεούς, πρὸς Διὸς</foreign>, the rendering that <lb/>
            first suggests itself is to be sure appropriate and ex- <lb/>
            pressive enough, but shocking to modern ears; what <lb/>
            was harmless in a Greek and a heathen becomes <lb/>
            profane in a Christian and an Englishman: and <lb/>
            though your Italian would think no harm of trans- <lb/>
            lating <foreign xml:lang="grc">νὴ Αία</foreign> by the plain per Dio, which he habitually <lb/>
            employs in his own ordinary conversation, and even <lb/>
            Schleiermacher sometimes blurts out an undisguised <lb/>
            'bei Gott', the reverence with which we are accus- <lb/>
            tomed to surround the sacred name of the Deity will <lb/>
            not allow us to have recourse to the same mode of <lb/>
            representation, and we are obliged therefore to fall <lb/>
            back upon the somewhat poor and tame substitutes <lb/>
            of 'by heaven' 'upon my word' 'by my faith' 'upon <lb/>
             <pb n="XV"/>
            my honour' 'egad' 'in heaven's name', which fall <lb/>
            short indeed of the expressive force of the original, <lb/>
            but are the strongest forms which propriety permits <lb/>
            us to employ.</p>
          <p>A s this professes before all things to be a literal <lb/>
            translation, it may be well perhaps in order to avoid <lb/>
            the possible charge of carelessness or ignorance from <lb/>
            such scholars-if indeed there be any such—who <lb/>
            would in all cases sacrifice the English idiom to <lb/>
            the preservation of the Greek, to notice a few points <lb/>
            in which I have not always rigorously adhered to <lb/>
            certain rules of translation which have been inculcated <lb/>
            in us from our earliest years by lessons addressed <lb/>
            alike to the reason and the feelings, and enforced at <lb/>
            the same time by a priori authority and by a poste- <lb/>
            riori application. My rule however has been to pay <lb/>
            due attention to such niceties, and I have only neg- <lb/>
            lected them when the exigencies of translation seemed <lb/>
            to me to require the sacrifice in order to avoid stif- <lb/>
            ness and awkwardness in the English expression. <lb/>
            Some of these points are : the distinction of the <lb/>
            Greek aorist and perfect, the uniform observance of <lb/>
            which has been by some scholars so peremptorily <lb/>
            insisted on. The fact however is that the idiom of <lb/>
            our own language differs in this particular so far <lb/>
            from the Greek that we are obliged very frequently <lb/>
            to express the Greek, aorist by the English perfect. <lb/>
            For instance in the common phrase <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἢδη εἶδον</foreign>, in which <lb/>
            the verb is rendered 'I have seen', the adverb which <lb/>
             <pb n="XVI"/>
            is supposed to account in this particular case for the <lb/>
            perfect sense of the aorist has really nothing what <lb/>
            ever to do with it 1. Where the Greeks said 'I once <lb/>
            saw', we say 'I have seen'. Again; who would think <lb/>
            of rendering the exulting song of the initiated, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἒφυγον <lb/>
            κακόν, εὖρον ἂμεινον</foreign>, by anything but the English per- <lb/>
            fect ? There is a similar difference between the French <lb/>
            and German idioms and our own in the use of these <lb/>
            tenses; that is, in sometimes expressing our aorist <lb/>
            by a perfect and vice versa, as waren sie ? ' have you <lb/>
            been?'; j'ai été... 'I was...'</p>
          <p>Again a Greek not unfrequently writes <foreign xml:lang="grc">γίγνεσθαι</foreign> <lb/>
            where an Englishman says simply to be'; and <lb/>
            though I hold that the distinction between the two <lb/>
            verbs is so philosophically important that it should <lb/>
            always be maintained when it is possible so to do— <lb/>
            and it will be seen that I have sometimes gone a <lb/>
            little out of my way to maintain it-yet the neglect <lb/>
            of it is sometimes (not often I believe) not only justi- <lb/>
            fiable but absolutely required.</p>
          <p>Of minor importance is the occasional omission <lb/>
            of the article in rendering <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἱ ἃλλοι</foreign>, and perhaps other <lb/>
            similar phrases; the non-observance of the position <lb/>
            of the article with substantive and adjective, in which <note type="footnote"> 1 I cannot agree with Mr Shilleto, crit. not. on Demosth. de F. L. <lb/>
            § 228, in thinking that the addition of temporal particles such as <foreign xml:lang="grc">άρτί, <lb/>
            πολλάκις, οὐπώποτε</foreign>, can make any difference whatsoever in the " nature" <lb/>
            or sense of the tense: the translation of the Greek aorist by our perfect <lb/>

            the substitution of the indefinite for the Greek de- <lb/>

          <p>Passing over other idiomatic differences of a simi- <lb/>
            lar character, there remains one point which is <lb/>
            important enough to be treated at greater length ; <lb/>
            more especially as the question is still unsettled, and <lb/>
            a writer of high authority has pronounced a very <lb/>
            uncompromising opinion upon it entirely opposed to <lb/>
            what I believe to be the truth. I refer to the trans- <lb/>
            lation of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ούπάνυ</foreign>, and I will take this opportunity to <lb/>
            enter in detail upon the consideration of the whole <lb/>
            question ; but as the note promises to be a somewhat <lb/>
            long one, it may perhaps find a fitter place in the <lb/>
            Appendix 1.</p>
          <p>As to the aids of which I have availed myself <lb/>
            in the translation, besides the notes of the Commen- <lb/>
            tators, I have constantly had before me Schleier- <lb/>
            macher's version and the Master of Trinity's Platonic <lb/>
            Dialogues for English Readers; with the exception <note type="footnote">1 See note C, in the Appendix. </note> <note type="footnote"> b </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="XVIII"/>
            of Cousin's translation, which I looked through <lb/>
            many years ago, I have seen no other. Schleier- <lb/>
            macher's version of this as of the other dialogues <lb/>
            is so literal and so exact that it serves the purpose <lb/>
            of a commentary of no mean order : as far as my <lb/>
            observation extends, he very seldom misses the <lb/>
            precise meaning of the original, and his extreme <lb/>
            acuteness and thorough knowledge of his author <lb/>
            render his assistance always valuable. Cousin's for <lb/>
            any such purpose is absolutely worthless. The former <lb/>
            however is, if I may venture to say so, too flat and <lb/>
            lifeless-at least to an English reader-to furnish <lb/>
            much assistance in turning a phrase or suggesting <lb/>
            an expression. Of Dr Whewell's work perhaps not <lb/>
            much more than a third of this particular dialogue is <lb/>
            a direct translation. To this I have to acknowledge a <lb/>
            few obligations, for here and there a vigorous phrase <lb/>
            or a happy turn of expression. But such direct <lb/>
            obligations amount I believe scarcely to half a dozen; <lb/>
            any other coincidences that may be found between <lb/>
            our versions are accidental.</p>
          <p>It only remains to say that the text I have <lb/>
            followed is that of the Zurich Editors, except in <lb/>
            a few rare instances which I have been careful to <lb/>
            point out.</p><pb n="XIX"/>

          <p>THE course of the argument of this dialogue is somewhat in- <lb/>
            tricate and at first sight desultory, and the subjects treated <lb/>
            in it are so multifarious, that the most various and diverse <lb/>
            opinions have been entertained as to the leading purpose and <lb/>
            intention of Plato in its composition. A good deal of the <lb/>
            complexity and consequent difficulty vanishes upon closer in- <lb/>
            spection; but enough remains to render the main scope and <lb/>
            design in some degree doubtful; and accordingly the most re- <lb/>
            cent writers upon the subject are by no means in agreement <lb/>
            with one another upon the point. A fair summary of their <lb/>
            views is given by Stallbaum, Introduction, pp. 31—35, and I <lb/>
            need not therefore repeat them here. Amongst these, a treatise <lb/>
            by Bonitz, published in the transactions of the Viennese Aca- <lb/>
            demy of Sciences (to which my references are made) and also <lb/>
            separately in Part I. of his Platonische Studien, deserves <lb/>
            especial mention. It contains a careful analysis of the argu- <lb/>
            ment together with an inquiry into the leading idea of the <lb/>
            dialogue, and a criticism of the views of two of his prede- <lb/>
            cessors, Steinhart1 and Susemihl, upon the same subject. <note type="footnote"> 1 This name, that of the author of Introductions prefixed to Hieronymus <lb/>

            This essay is distinguished throughout by clearness modera- <lb/>
            tion and good sense.</p>
          <p>The Greek title of the dialogue is <foreign xml:lang="grc">Γοργίας, ἢ περὶ ῤητο- <lb/>
            ρικη̑ς, ἁνατρεπτικός</foreign>, Diog. Laert. Vit. Plat. § 59. These <lb/>
            second titles, though it is generally agreed that they do not <lb/>
            proceed from Plato himself, and have therefore no final and <lb/>
            decisive authority in determining the true subject of his <lb/>
            dialogues, yet as representing the earliest opinion as to the <lb/>
            nature of their contents of native and probably well informed <lb/>
            Platonists, should not I think be entirely set aside; and in <lb/>
            this particular instance, as it seems to me, Rhetoric, the <lb/>
            subject assigned by the title as the leading one, may when <lb/>
            properly understood fairly put in its claim with the rest to <lb/>
            be that which was uppermost in the authors mind in writing <lb/>
            the Gorgias.</p>
          <p>The term <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἁνατρεπτικός</foreign>, subversive, destructive, opposed <lb/>
            to <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατασκευαστικός</foreign>, constructive, denotes that the Gorgias, <lb/>
            like the Theastetus and Meno for example with which Schlei- <lb/>
            ermacher places it in immediate connection, belongs to the <lb/>
            class of polemical or dialectical dialogues; in which the object <lb/>
            is not so much to establish a doctrine or build up a system, <lb/>
            as to clear the ground for either of these by the removal of <lb/>
            popular errors and fallacies and the refutation of antagonist <lb/>
            speculations and theories. Of this class of the Platonic dia- <lb/>
            logues, to which Schleiermacher assigns the middle division <lb/>
            in his arrangement, between the elementary and the con- <lb/>
            structive, placing the Gorgias at their head, he says, Introd. <lb/>
            to Gorg.1 p. 4, that " they no longer treat as the first (the ele- <lb/>
            mentary) did of the Method of Philosophy, but of its object, <lb/>
            with a view to attain a complete conception and a right <lb/>
            distinction of it; nor yet at the same time do they seek <note type="footnote"> by Stallbaum into Reinhart, under which form it invariably appears in his In- <lb/>

            like the latter properly speaking to represent the two real <lb/>
            sciences, Physics (in its widest sense including Cosmology <lb/>
            and Ontology or Metaphysics) and Ethics, but only in a pre- <lb/>
            paratory and progressive way to determine what they are; <lb/>
            and, whether considered singly or in their mutual connec- <lb/>
            tion, they are distinguished by a construction, less uniform <lb/>
            than in the first division, but particularly artificial and al- <lb/>
            most difficult." Compare general Introd. pp. 49, 50. Ac- <lb/>
            cordingly this dialogue occupies pretty nearly the same , <lb/>
            position in Ethical, as the Theætetus in Intellectual, Phi- <lb/>
            losopliy: as there the various existing theories of knowledge, <lb/>
            and especially the ultra Sceptical, and, as we may call it <lb/>
            from its originator and supporters, Sophistical theory of Pro- <lb/>
            tagoras are examined and refuted; so here the same course <lb/>
            is pursued with the current notions and doctrines about jus- <lb/>
            tice virtue and the rule of life; and amongst them, the So- <lb/>
            phistical paradoxes that might is the only right and justice <lb/>
            nothing but a convention of society, and that pleasure is the <lb/>
            only good, are most prominently brought forward and most <lb/>
            signally refuted. The solution of all these great questions, <lb/>
            and the true views of Knowledge and Science, of Justice <lb/>
            and the Good, are to be sought for in the Constructive or <lb/>
            Demonstrative Dialogues, the Philebus and Republic. In <lb/>
            the Gorgias, as in the Theætetus, the process is indirect or <lb/>
            dialectical, and the result in some sense negative-negative <lb/>
            that is for philosophical purposes and as regards the con- <lb/>
            struction of a system, the conclusions being all of a practical <lb/>
            character and bearing solely upon the regulation of life and <lb/>
            conduct. This will appear from the summary of them p. <lb/>
            527 B, c. Compare the remarks of Bonitz u. s. p. 272.</p>
          <p>But before we proceed to inquire into the claims of Rhe- <lb/>
            toric to be regarded as the principal subject in this dialogue, <lb/>
            we must first consider the sense in which this Rhetoric is to <lb/>
            be interpreted, and what is the light in which Plato here <lb/>
            regards it.</p>
          <p>The modern and narrower sense of Rhetoric as the art of <lb/>
             <pb n="XXII"/>
            speaking, and even the ancient definitions of it, as 'the art of <lb/>
            persuasion,' the original definition, or Aristotle's correction of <lb/>
            this, 'the faculty of discerning the possible means of per- <lb/>
            suasion in a given subject,' or any of the various definitions <lb/>
            enumerated by Quintilian in the 15th Chapter of his second <lb/>
            book, would give us a most inadequate notion of the real ex- <lb/>
            tent and bearings of this new art as it was understood, and <lb/>
            practised by its Sophistical originators and Professors in the <lb/>
            time of Socrates; and would leave entirely unexplained the <lb/>
            character ascribed to it in this dialogue, and the connection <lb/>
            in which it there stands with the multifarious discussions <lb/>
            upon virtue and politics which are made to arise out of the <lb/>
            consideration of its nature and true meaning. The functions <lb/>
            which it assumed in the hands of its earliest Professors, and <lb/>
            the prominent part that it consequently plays in the Gorgias, <lb/>
            will be best understood from the account that they are made <lb/>
            to give of themselves by Plato, and similar notices of their <lb/>
            profession and practice which are to be found in other <lb/>
            writers.</p>
          <p>In Protag. 318 E, Protagoras in describing his own pro- <lb/>
            fessional occupation says, "The instruction that I give is <lb/>
            good counsel with a view to the best management of a man's <lb/>
            private affairs and the administration of his own household, <lb/>
            and with regard to affairs of state, to qualify him most effi- <lb/>
            ciently to act and speak in public life," that is, practical <lb/>
            economics and politics. To which Socrates replies, "I un- <lb/>
            derstand you to mean the art political, and that what you <lb/>
            profess is to make men good citizens." " That is," answers <lb/>
            Protagoras, " precisely the profession that I make." This was <lb/>
            in fact the usual profession of the early Sophists, and was <lb/>
            implied in their undertaking to teach virtue.</p>
          <p>The same is ascribed to them by Meno, the pupil of <lb/>
            Gorgias, in the dialogue of that name p. 91 A. " He <lb/>
            (Meno)," says Socrates, " has been telling me ever so long <lb/>
            that the kind of wisdom and virtue that he covets is that <lb/>
            which enables men to administer well their houses and na- <lb/>
             <pb n="XXIII"/>
            tive cities, and to pay due respect to their parents, and to <lb/>
            know how to entertain and dismiss citizens and strangers in <lb/>
            a manner worthy of a good man. To acquire these accom- <lb/>
            plishments a youth must be sent to those famous men who <lb/>
            profess to be teachers of virtue, and place themselves at the <lb/>
            disposal of any Greek who desires to learn it, for which they <lb/>
            have fixed and exact a certain fee." " And who do you <lb/>
            mean by these, Socrates?" inquires Anytus. " Why you <lb/>
            surely must know yourself that these are they whom men <lb/>
            call Sophists," is the reply.</p>
          <p>To the same effect it is said, Rep. x. 600 C, that Pro- <lb/>
            tagoras of Abdera and Prodicus of Ceos and a host of others <lb/>
            have contrived to get the notion into the heads of their con- <lb/>
            temporaries that none of them will be able to manage either <lb/>
            his own house or city unless they superintend their educa- <lb/>
            tion, and on the strength of this skill have so entirely gained <lb/>
            the affections of their associates that they are all but ready <lb/>
            to carry them about on their heads.</p>
          <p>Similarly Isocrates, in the next generation, of himself and <lb/>
            his pupils, de Perm. § 285 <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοὺς τὰτοίαυ̑τα μανθάνοντας καὶ <lb/>

          <p>Again, "a man's virtue," according to Meno, Gorgias' <lb/>
            pupil, Meno 71 E, is <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἱκανὸν εἶναι τἁτη̑ς πόλεως πράττειν</foreign>, <lb/>
            " to be qualified to play a part in public life," and in so <lb/>
            doing to be of service to one's friends, and to do injury to <lb/>
            one's enemies, at the same time taking good care oneself to <lb/>
            incur no risk of the like.</p>
          <p>Similarly Prodicus is reported to have said of himself <lb/>
            and the Sophists in general, Euthyd. 305 C, that they stood <lb/>
            on the boundary line between the philosopher and the <lb/>
            politician.</p>
          <p>In Hipp. Maj. 282 B, the object of Hippias' instructions <lb/>
            is defined in nearly the same terms as Protagoras uses: <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ <lb/>
            δημόσια πράττειν δύνασθαι μετὰ τω̑ν ἱδίων</foreign>, " to attain the <lb/>
             <pb n="XXIV"/>
            faculty of managing public affairs together with one's <lb/>
            own."</p>
          <p>So Evenus of Pares, the Rhetorical teacher and Elegiac <lb/>
            poet, was a professor <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρετη̂ς ἀνθρωπίνης τε καὶ πολιτικη̂ς</foreign> <lb/>
            Apol. Socr. 20 B.</p>
          <p>Of the early Sophists or teachers of rhetoric in general <lb/>
            Isocrates says, <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατὰ τω̂ν Σοφιστω̂ν</foreign>, § 20, that they were <lb/>
            worse than the dialecticians in that they <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπὶ τοὺς πολιτικοὺς</foreign> <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_57_fig1.jpg"/></figure><lb/>
               <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">στησαν εϊναι διδάσκαλοι</foreign>. And of the same, Plutarch, Vit. <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_57_fig2.jpg"/></figure><lb/>
               </p>
          <p>The profession then of these early Sophists and teachers <lb/>
            of Rhetoric implied nothing less than a complete training for <lb/>
            all public and private duties, and the formation of the cha- <lb/>
            racter of a good citizen and an honest man. How these lofty <lb/>
            pretensions were actually carried out in practice and their <lb/>
            assumed functions fulfilled we learn as well from the doctrines <lb/>
            and views of life propounded by Polus and Callicles in this <lb/>
            dialogue, and the thoroughly selfish objects which they pro- <lb/>
            pose to themselves as the end of a political career and of <lb/>
            rhetoric its instrument, as also from the more direct state- <lb/>
            ments of the gravest and most respectable authors, Xenophon, <lb/>
            Isocrates, Aristotle, Plato and others, which I have quoted <lb/>
            elsewhere (Journ. of Class, and Sacred Philology No. 2) and <lb/>
            need not here repeat.</p>
          <p>The real use that was made of this new art by its dis- <lb/>
            ciples was to avail themselves of its powerful aid in securing <lb/>
            their own advancement by flattering and humouring the <lb/>
            passions of the mob, or to prove that black is white in a law- <lb/>
            court in defence of themselves or others by whom they might <lb/>
            be employed. That the inculcation of these deceitful arti- <lb/>
            fices was actually one of the objects of these teachers is shown <lb/>
             <pb n="XXV"/>
            by the extracts and notices that remain to us of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τέχναι</foreign> or <lb/>
            treatises upon rhetoric of the early writers on the subject, <lb/>
            Corax, Tisias, and others, and by the Art now generally <lb/>
            ascribed to Anaximenes, but at all events proceeding from <lb/>
            the Sophistical school, which abounds with such immoral <lb/>
            suggestions: the object proposed in them was to persuade at <lb/>
            any price regardless of any considerations of truth and <lb/>
            honour. The TOV <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἣττω λόγον κρείττω ποιε</foreign>ȋ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ν</foreign> is no mere <lb/>
            calumny of Aristophanes, but the genuine profession of <lb/>
            Protagoras, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ΙΙρωταγόρου ἐπάγγελμα</foreign>, Arist. Rhet. II. <lb/>
            24. 11.</p>
          <p>It is this assumption as contrasted with the actual practice <lb/>
            of the Sophistical Rhetoricians and their pupils that justifies <lb/>
            the terms applied to their art by Plato, when he speaks of <lb/>
            it, Gorg. cc. XIX, XX. pp. 464 B—466 A, and Sophistic with <lb/>
            which it is closely allied, as the spurious delusive unreal art <lb/>
            of Politics, bearing the same relation to the true arts of the <lb/>
            statesman, legislation and the administration of justice, as <lb/>
            cookery does to medicine, or the art of adorning the outside <lb/>
            of the person so as to produce a deceitful appearance of <lb/>
            health and comeliness, the perfumer's, tailor's, and hair- <lb/>
            dresser's arts, to gymnastics. And Aristotle, Rhet. I. 2. 7, <lb/>
            describes it in precisely equivalent language, borrowing even <lb/>
            his phraseology from Plato (Gorg. 464 D), " Hence rhetoric <lb/>
            and those who lay claim to it assume the disguise of political <lb/>
            science, partly owing to ignorance (on the part of its professors) <lb/>
            partly to ostentation and quackery, and partly to other causes <lb/>
            incident to humanity," and again, Eth. Nic. x. 10, " The <lb/>
            sophists profess to teach politics but none of them practise <lb/>
            it ;” contrary to the habit of other artists, as physicians or <lb/>
            statuaries, who usually combine theory and practice. " But <lb/>
            of the Sophists, those who profess this are very far indeed <lb/>
            from really teaching it; for they know absolutely nothing <lb/>
            whatever of its nature and objects : for if they had, they <lb/>
            would not have made it the same as rhetoric or even <lb/>
            worse...."</p><pb n="XXVI"/>
            
          <p>Thus of the two Platonic dialogues In which Rhetoric <lb/>
            plays a leading part, in the Gorgias it is looked at solely from <lb/>
            the moral side and as the instrument of politics with which <lb/>
            it was in fact confounded ; it is the object of the rhetorician, <lb/>
            and not the method or means by which he seeks to attain <lb/>
            this object, that comes into consideration; see especially <lb/>
            c. 58 foil. pp. 502 D—504 E, and the concluding words of <lb/>
            the summary, 527 C, <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ τῇ ρ̒ητορικῇ οὕτω χρηστέον, ἐπὶ</foreign> TO <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίκαιον ἀεί</foreign>. In the Phædrus on the contrary it is regarded <lb/>
            technically as an art; its hollowness and insufficiency even <lb/>
            for the purposes for which it was invented exposed, its <lb/>
            technicalities and its method criticised and ridiculed : it is <lb/>
            shown how an art which would really effect the object pro- <lb/>
            posed to itself by rhetoric, viz. persuasion or conviction, must <lb/>
            be based upon a thorough knowledge of all the varieties of <lb/>
            human character, and the modes of appealing effectually to <lb/>
            each variety studied and determined; but after all, even if <lb/>
            the end be attained, no art or process which reaches no <lb/>
            further than mere probability and temporary persuasion can <lb/>
            be of the least value as compared with the true insight which <lb/>
            comes by the study of philosophy and by dialectics its instru- <lb/>
            ment. On the object and value of dialectics, contrasted with <lb/>
            those of rhetoric, see likewise Phileb. 58 A—D. Upon the <lb/>
            hints thus thrown out in the Phædrus, 271 C—272 B, <lb/>
            273 D, E, is based the method pursued by Aristotle in his <lb/>
            treatment of Rhetoric; it is this doubtless that first suggested <lb/>
            to him the elaborate and masterly analysis of human cha- <lb/>
            racter motives and passions which constitutes the novelty <lb/>
            and the peculiarity and the principal value of his great <lb/>
            work, and occupies the larger portion of its two first <lb/>
            books.</p>
          <p>The fundamental difference of conception as to the pro- <lb/>
            vince, functions and value, and proper mode of dealing with <lb/>
            this art furnishes a curious and interesting illustration of the <lb/>
            diversity of intellectual character and aim by which the two <lb/>
            great philosophers of antiquity were so remarkably distin- <lb/>
             <pb n="XXVII"/>
            guished. The stern haughty! uncompromising Idealist, <lb/>
            wrapped up in his sublime speculations and with his lofty <lb/>
            unattainable ideal of truth and right ever present to his <lb/>
            mind; holding scornfully aloof from the business and pur- <lb/>
            suits of a world which he disdained, and rebuilding society <lb/>
            from its very foundations in the attempt to carry out his <lb/>
            grand visionary scheme of a perfect Republic; acknowledging <lb/>
            no pleasure but the contemplation of truth, and sternly <lb/>
            banishing from his model state all the arts which minister <lb/>
            merely to the gratification of the senses or the intellect; will <lb/>
            not stoop to recognise the value of an art which falls short of <lb/>
            perfection, and seeks to accommodate itself to human infir- <lb/>
            mity, and to serve the practical needs and uses of society; <lb/>
            when conviction and full knowledge are impossible contents <lb/>
            itself with probability and persuasion, and will accept some- <lb/>
            thing short of complete justice from the imperfection of <lb/>
            human tribunals.</p>
          <p>The shrewd observant sagacious Aristotle, the philosopher <lb/>
            of experience and thorough man of the world, eschews all <lb/>
            such Utopian and higflying notions; he is satisfied to take <lb/>
            things as he finds them and make the best of existing cir- <lb/>
            cumstances. As the mountain will not come to Mahomet, <lb/>
            Mahomet goes to the mountain. Assemblies must be held <lb/>
            and governments carried on; crimes will be committed and <lb/>
            disputes arise between man and man; and these must be <lb/>
            submitted to courts of justice. Statesmen must speak in <note type="footnote"> 1 This conception of Plato's character is derived solely from his writings. <lb/>
            It is however confirmed by the evidence of the Comic Poet Amphis, Fragm. <lb/>
            Dexidem. in Diogenes, Vit. Plat. § 28: </note> <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_57_fig3.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              And Heraclides reports (in the same Diogenes, § 26) that in his youth he was <lb/>
              so modest and sober that he was never seen to indulge in a fit of boisterous or <lb/>
              excessive merriment. In his mature years he preserved the same character; <lb/>
              most of his laughter is of the sardonic kind, and his humour is shown chiefly <lb/>
              in satire. How different from the loud hearty uproarious fun of Aristophanes! <lb/>
               <pb n="XXVIII"/>
              the one, accusation and defence be carried on in the other: <lb/>
              it is well to be prepared for both these contingencies. If <lb/>
              we arc not so prepared, innocence and right may be overcome <lb/>
              by fraud and injustice; the artificial aid of rhetoric allows <lb/>
              truth and right to assert their natural superiority (Rhet. 1. <lb/>
              1..12), which might otherwise be often endangered by human <lb/>
              artifice and ingenuity. And further, as Gorgias is made by <lb/>
              Plato to plead in defence of his profession (Gorg. c. XL), we <lb/>
              have no right to argue from the use to the abuse of any- <lb/>
              thing. Again, in the conflict of human passions and inter- <lb/>
              ests truth is often unattainable, probable evidence must be <lb/>
              accepted; mathematical demonstration belongs only to sci- <lb/>
              ence, necessity which is essential to demonstration can never <lb/>
              be predicated of human actions and motives with which alone <lb/>
              rhetoric deals; and such as are the materials and elements <lb/>
              such must the reasoning be. The probable is therefore as- <lb/>
              sumed as the necessary basis and groundwork of his system.</p>
          <p>This premised, we now proceed to inquire whether rhe- <lb/>
            toric as thus explained may be regarded as the principal <lb/>
            subject of Plato's dialogue. This view is very unceremo- <lb/>
            niously rejected by Olympiodorus, without however assigning <lb/>
            any reason whatsoever for that rejection except that those <lb/>
            who hold this opinion ‛characterise the whole from a part;' <lb/>
            which assumes the very point in question. I will venture to <lb/>
            say in addition, that what I know of Olympiodorus' com- <lb/>
            mentary has not inspired me with a very high opinion of his <lb/>
            judgment, nor at all inclined me to accept his ipse dixit <lb/>
            upon any matter of this kind. Next comes an authority of <lb/>
            a very different order. Schleiermacher, Introd. to Gorg. pp. <lb/>
            1, 2, classes rhetoric with a number of other subjects pre- <lb/>
            viously suggested by others as containing the main gist and <lb/>
            purpose of the work; 'in all of which views' he says that <lb/>
            part of the whole which is brought so prominently forward <lb/>
            appears only in a very loose connection with the rest; so <lb/>
            that, if the whole be viewed in this light, the inquiry into <lb/>
            the nature of pleasure especially, can only be regarded as <lb/>
             <pb n="XXIX"/>
            an almost superfluous patch strangely stuck on to the rest <lb/>
            of the work.' x This is no doubt true in the main if rhetoric <lb/>
            be understood exclusively in its narrower sense of the art of <lb/>
            speaking; though even in this case the exhibition of it as <lb/>
            one of the arts of flattery, and the classification of it with <lb/>
            the arts which seek only the gratification of those whom <lb/>
            they profess to serve without any consideration of their real <lb/>
            good, may be thought to connect it immediately with an in- <lb/>
            quiry into the nature of pleasure; but when it is taken in <lb/>
            its wider signification as above explained, as a training for <lb/>
            public life and private duty, its connection with the esta- <lb/>
            blishment of the rule of life and the choice of a course of <lb/>
            life—which if rhetoric is not, must I think be regarded as <lb/>
            the leading conception of the dialogue-is too apparent to <lb/>
            be mistaken or require further explanation. x The inquiry <lb/>
            into the nature of pleasure I myself should regard as subor- <lb/>
            dinate to the great moral object of the dialogue, the deter- <lb/>
            mination of the end aim and rule of life. It is shown inci- <lb/>
            dentally from the nature of pleasure, that, not being identical <lb/>
            with the good, it cannot be and ought not to be a man's sole <lb/>
            or principal aim.</p>
          <p>In fact if the main purpose of the dialogue be the prac- <lb/>
            tical moral one of contrasting the true and the false objects <lb/>
            and rules of life1, of exposing the vanity of the latter by a <note type="footnote"> 1 This view agrees very well with that of Bonitz—a writer from whom one <lb/>
            would not desire to differ-as to the object and main purpose of the dialogue. <lb/>
            Op. cit. p. 271. Schwerlich kann dann noch ein Zweifel sein, dass die mit <lb/>
            Kallikles verhandelte Frage: "ist Philosophic im Platonischen Sinne, oder ist <lb/>
            politische Rhetorik in ihrem damaligen thatsachlichen Zustande eine würdige <lb/>
            Lebensaufgabe?" den Kern und Zweck des ganzen Dialogs bezeichnet. Of <lb/>
            course the study and pursuit of Philosophy are in Plato's conception the highest <lb/>
            and worthiest object and aim of life: but as little is said of this during the <lb/>
            course of the dialogue and nothing at all at the conclusion, I would rather <lb/>
            instead of specifying philosophy and rhetoric as the contrasted members of the <lb/>
            antithesis, express the result in more general terms as I have done, as the true <lb/>
            and false object and rule of life, rhetoric being no doubt taken and put promi- <lb/>
            nently forward as the representative of the latter. In Bonitz’s favour is the <lb/>
            passage, 500 C, but philosophy is dropped in the final summary. The opinion </note> <lb/>

            criticism of the popular views entertained upon this great <lb/>
            question, and establishing the superiority of the former, it <lb/>
            seems that no better representative of the false objects and <lb/>
            rules by which men direct and regulate their conduct in life <lb/>
            could have been selected than rhetoric, which stands for the <lb/>
            career of politics as vulgarly understood and the pursuits of <lb/>
            ambition, the most plausible and attractive and in some sort <lb/>
            the highest of these false ends and aims; which may thus <lb/>
            be fairly regarded as involving the conception of both. When <lb/>
            we look at the dialogue alone, and apart from its enforced <lb/>
            connection with other works of the author, which I must be <lb/>
            permitted to say seems here as elsewhere to lead the acute <lb/>
            Schleiermacher somewhat astray ;x when we consider that the <lb/>
            three interlocutors who represent the three principal stages <lb/>
            or general divisions of the argument are all rhetoricians pro- <lb/>
            fessional or practical; that each of these three main divisions <lb/>
            starts with and arises out of rhetoric and the views of life <lb/>
            which accompanied the cultivation of it; that it recurs at <lb/>
            every turn, and that at any rate no other single topic occu- <lb/>
            pies anything like the amount of actual space that is as- <lb/>
            signed to this in the dialogue; that the entire dialogue begins <lb/>
            and ends (see p. 527 c) with it; that it was a subject of the <lb/>
            highest practical importance from the direct influence which <lb/>
            it exercised upon the education, habits, principles, and moral <lb/>
            conceptions of all those who aspired to distinction in the <lb/>
            state and to the fulfilment of the highest functions of citizen- <lb/>
            ship, and one thoroughly worthy to be so treated by Plato— <lb/>
            all this may well make us pause before we reject the opinion <lb/>
            that the correction of the immoral and ill-founded notions <lb/>
            which prevailed upon this weighty matter was not the imme- <lb/>
            diate object of the author in the composition of this work:x <lb/>

            to agree substantially with that which I have put forward, judging by the <lb/>
            introductory note on the Title, Platonic Dialogues, II. 166, and the brief obser- <lb/>

            thread upon which the argument hangs, and the most promi- <lb/>
            nent, if not the most philosophically important, of those <lb/>
            which occupied the mind of the writer of the Gorgias.</p>
          <p>The only modern writer however with whom I am ac- <lb/>
            quainted who adheres unreservedly to the most ancient <lb/>
            opinion upon this question is Van Heusde; who in his review <lb/>
            of this dialogue, Init. Phil. Plat. pp. 163—174, seems to take <lb/>
            it for granted that rhetoric is in reality Plato's leading idea, <lb/>
            and traces the contrast between the true and false notions of <lb/>
            the perfection and proper office of the art through the various <lb/>
            stages of the discussion. But we want no other authority <lb/>
            than the work itself for the determination of the question 1.</p>
          <p>It is singular that amidst all the controversy and variety <lb/>
            of opinion to which this question has given rise so little at- <lb/>
            tention2 should have been paid to a passage, already referred <lb/>
            to, in which the author himself seems to state clearly enough <lb/>
            what his intention was in writing the dialogue and what its <lb/>
            conclusions amount to. It occurs at p. 527 B, C.x The results <lb/>
            arrived at as there stated are, that doing wrong is to be more <lb/>
            carefully avoided than suffering it; that sterling truth and <lb/>
            worth of character should be a man's study and not the mere <lb/>
            seeming and outside show; that whatever evil there be in <lb/>
            a man must be removed by correction, which is the use of <lb/>
            punishment; that next to being just and good it is desira- <lb/>
            ble to be made so by correction and chastisement; that all <lb/>
            flattering i.e. the seeking to impart mere gratification by <lb/>
            any art or pursuit is to be shunned; and rhetoric as well as <note type="footnote"> 1 I may here observe that some of the most recent writers upon the history <lb/>
            of Greek philosophy, as Zeller and Butler, have treated the Gorgias with unde- <lb/>
            served neglect; the latter especially hardly ever alludes to it; I suppose because <lb/>
            they found more definite statements upon the same subjects in the constructive <lb/>
            dialogues. Still they have not dealt with the Theætetus in the same way. <lb/>
            Brandis bestows about four pages chiefly made up of quotations to this dialogue. <lb/>
            He considers the several arguments merely in their ethical bearings, and pro- <lb/>
            nounces no direct opinion upon the point here in question. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 It is however noticed, but without any particular stress being laid upon <lb/>

            every other action employed to promote the ends of justice <lb/>
            and to enforce the right. X Another passage equally explicit <lb/>
            occurs, c. 50, p. 500 c.</p>
          <p>What all this amounts to may be thus expressed: that <lb/>
            in spite of all plausible theories and views of life, (such as, <lb/>
            that might alone is right, that pleasure is the only good, and <lb/>
            so forth,) and all fallacious appearances, (as the happiness <lb/>
            for example of Archelaus and those who resemble him, or <lb/>
            the external semblance without the reality of virtue by which <lb/>
            society is often imposed upon,) truth justice and right are <lb/>
            alone to be aimed at, and to them all else is to be sacrificed <lb/>
            when they come into collision. In the pursuit of these pain <lb/>
            and danger, exposure and ridicule, are to be cheerfully en- <lb/>
            countered, and the remedial correction of legal punishment <lb/>
            to be eagerly sought, instead of shunned, with a view to the <lb/>
            attainment of these, the soul's only real good: and to this <lb/>
            end rhetoric like everything else is to be subordinate. Or <lb/>
            in other words, that right and justice are the only rule of <lb/>
            life, ambition and self-seeking only lead men to injustice and <lb/>
            wrong, that is to their own injury and ruin here and here- <lb/>
            after. And this I take to be the general conclusion scope <lb/>
            and purpose of Plato's dialogue.</p>
          <p>We will now proceed to consider the argument in detail, <lb/>
            and trace the successive steps and stages of its progress to- <lb/>
            wards these conclusions. It divides itself naturally and easily <lb/>
            into three! principal portions distinguished by the three <lb/>
            interlocutors who come successively into collision with So- <note type="footnote"> 1 Steinhart and Susemihl who appear to think that Plato constructed his <lb/>
            dramatic dialogue on the model of a five-act play, assume, after a short pro- <lb/>
            logue or introduction in cc. 1, 2, a fivefold division; cc. 3—20, 21—36, 37—46, <lb/>
            47—61, 62—83; and to make the resemblance complete, compare the myths <lb/>
            to the Deus ex machine which sometimes winds up an entangled plot, and the <lb/>
            summary of the principal results of the dialogue to " the anapaests which at <lb/>
            the conclusion are wont to express in a few words the fundamental idea of the <lb/>
            Tragedy." The utter baselessness of this fanciful comparison, and of the <lb/>
            fivefold division to which it gives rise, is easily and at no considerable length <lb/>
            exposed by Bonitz in his essay, pp. 275—278. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="XXXIII"/>
            crates and assist him by their opposition in carrying out his <lb/>
            argument.</p>
          <p>These three stages are distinctly marked, not only by the <lb/>
            change of interlocutors, and the change of tone and feeling <lb/>
            and expression and views of morality introduced with them, <lb/>
            corresponding to which is a change of form in the mode of <lb/>
            conducting the conversation (see Bonitz, u. s. pp. 265—268), <lb/>
            but also by a retractation in the two latter of the principles <lb/>
            previously admitted, and a resumption of the argument upon <lb/>
            a new basis. x ‛The three principal divisions,' says Bonitz, <lb/>
            p. 263, ‛ are distinguished by the character of the moral views <lb/>
            of life therein subjected to criticism, by the depth of the <lb/>
            principles adduced against them, and finally by the entire <lb/>
            form and tone adopted in carrying on the conversation.' *</p>
          <p>In the person of Gorgias we have represented the virtual <lb/>
            acknowledgement of moral right, essentially, though not for- <lb/>
            In ally, expressed; this appears in his hesitation to assert that <lb/>
            it is not the duty of a teacher of Rhetoric to impart to his <lb/>
            pupils correct notions of right and wrong if they come to him <lb/>
            ignorant of such distinctions, though he is thereby involved <lb/>
            in a contradiction, and seems, from other evidence, in reality <lb/>
            to have differed from his sophistical brethren in abstaining <lb/>
            from making the ordinary profession of teaching virtue.</p>
          <p>In Polus is marked the unsteady wavering between the <lb/>
            admiration of external power and splendour without regard <lb/>
            to moral considerations, and yet on the other side a reluc- <lb/>
            tance to deny that right is more fair and noble than wrong. <lb/>
            Plato thus makes him the type of that compromising spirit <lb/>
            which prevails so widely amongst the mass of mankind. <lb/>
            Video meliora proboque, Deteriora sequor. He has never <lb/>
            thought deeply and seriously upon any question and has no <lb/>
            fixed principles of action; he is ready to take up with any <lb/>
            popular notions, and allows himself to be imposed upon by <lb/>
            the deceitful appearances of good: and it soon appears that <lb/>
            he has not even distinguished between real and apparent <lb/>
            power, between doing what one pleases or what seems fit, <note type="footnote"> c </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="XXXIV"/>
            and doing that which is really good and of service to us, <lb/>
            in which true power can alone consist. Accordingly in his <lb/>
            answer Socrates deals with him dialectically without going <lb/>
            deep into the questions raised, and refutes him merely by <lb/>
            showing the inconsistency between his assumptions and the <lb/>
            admissions he is obliged to make, and by the aid of the <lb/>
            indefinite term <foreign xml:lang="grc">καλόν</foreign>, of which the signification in the COIn- <lb/>
            mon use of language is very vague and uncertain.</p>
          <p>In Callicles' hands all this is changed; lie impatiently <lb/>
            flings aside all compromise and all conventional expressions, <lb/>
            and boldly exposes the immoral theory in all its naked <lb/>
            deformity. He, unlike his predecessor, has thought upon <lb/>
            these questions, and is able to justify the self-seeking spirit <lb/>
            which he avows by a theory which makes so called justice <lb/>
            and right a mere convention established for the convenience <lb/>
            of the majority, who are the weaker party, in order to shackle <lb/>
            the stronger and prevent him from asserting his natural <lb/>
            right, which is the supreme authority over his fellows; and <lb/>
            when further pressed lie maintains in accordance with these <lb/>
            views that pleasure undistinguished and unlimited is the <lb/>
            only good. Such thorough going opinions require an equally <lb/>
            thorough examination of the principles on which they rest, <lb/>
            and we accordingly find in the last stage of the argument <lb/>
            a more fundamental and searching inquiry into the very <lb/>
            nature of the conception on which Morality is based. The <lb/>
            substance of the remarks immediately preceding is derived <lb/>
            from Bonitz's Essay, pp. 263—268.</p>
          <p>After a short preface, in which we are introduced to the <lb/>
            scene—Callicles’ house at Athens-and the characters of the <lb/>
            dialogue, the argument opens at once with a question ad- <lb/>
            dressed by Socrates to Gorgias, the most distinguished living <lb/>
            professor of the art of Rhetoric, who is now on a second visit <lb/>
            to Athens and lodging with Callicles, as to the nature and <lb/>
            <lb/>
            meaning of his profession. The discussion which follows is <lb/>
            conducted with the utmost politeness and decorum on both <lb/>
            sides; until Gorgias who has at first defined his art merely as <lb/>
             <pb n="XXXV"/>
            the art of persuasion-the received definition at the time, <lb/>
            from which it appears that it deals only with what is proba- <lb/>
            ble or plausible, and is satisfied with the appearance without <lb/>
            the reality of knowledge—is made to acknowledge that the <lb/>
            Rhetorician is bound to teach justice, that is to impart some <lb/>
            moral instruction to his pupils, though as we learn from the <lb/>
            Mono as well as the present dialogue he not only made no <lb/>
            such profession himself but laughed at those that did. The <lb/>
            true rhetorician, is the conclusion of this first division of the <lb/>
            argument, that is the master of the art, if it were what it <lb/>
            professed to be, the art political, whose office is to train men <lb/>
            for the duties of public and private life, must himself be a <lb/>
            just and good man; that is, he must be acquainted with the <lb/>
            justice and virtue which he undertakes to teach, and will <lb/>
            then necessarily act in accordance with his knowledge1—at <lb/>
            least so says Socrates, and Gorgias does not contradict him.</p>
          <p>The same opinion of the necessity of virtue to the perfec- <lb/>
            tion of an orator was held by Quintilian. See Inst. Orat. <lb/>
            Proœm. §§ 9, 18. In II. 15, 24—28, he refers to this discus- <lb/>
            sion of the Gorgias, and argues that it is only ignorance of <lb/>
            Plato's writings and the neglect of the distinction between <lb/>
            the ‛elenctic’ and ‛dogmatic’ dialogues that could lead any <lb/>
            one to suppose that his opinion of rhetoric was really un- <lb/>
            favourable, concluding thus, § 28, ut appareat, Platoni non <lb/>
            rhetoricen videri malum, sed eam veram nisi justo ac bono <lb/>
            non contingere.</p>
          <p>The author of the Rhetorica ad Alexandrum in a very <lb/>
            absurd chapter, the 39th, likewise inculcates the union of <lb/>
            virtue with rhetoric. He applies the rules of rhetoric to <lb/>
            the conduct of life, and shows in detail how the principles <lb/>
            which regulate a man's moral behaviour agree with or may <lb/>
            be derived from the rules which determine the proper treat- <lb/>
            ment of the five divisions of the speech and their contents, <lb/>
            the <foreign xml:lang="grc">προοίμιν, διήγησις πίστειις</foreign>, Ta <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρὸς ἀνίδικον</foreign>, and <note type="footnote"> 1 On this reasoning and the Ethical theory it implies, see below, p. lxix. </note> <note type="footnote"> c 2. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="XXXVI"/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπίλογος</foreign> ; the object proposed to a man to encourage him <lb/>
            in the practice of virtue being, that you thereby acquire <lb/>
            a reputation for honesty and respectability which has a <lb/>
            powerful influence in gaining credit with an audience. § 2.</p>
          <p>In making the above admission, which is extracted from <lb/>
            him by a short course of Socratic cross-examination, Gorgias <lb/>
            has allowed himself to be betrayed into an inconsistency with <lb/>
            a statement which he had previously made in defending his <lb/>
            art from the popular aspersions founded upon the frequent <lb/>
            abuse of it; that namely though it is quite possible to make <lb/>
            an improper use of rhetoric as of any other power acquired <lb/>
            by art, still the teachers of it and the art itself are not justly <lb/>
            chargeable with this, which is due solely to the wickedness <lb/>
            of those who pervert to evil uses the instructions intended to <lb/>
            be employed upon honest and virtuous objects alone. The <lb/>
            admission of the possibility of injustice and fraud in a well <lb/>
            qualified rhetorician is plainly inconsistent with that sub- <lb/>
            sequently forced from him by Socrates, that a good rheto- <lb/>
            rician must also be a good man: this is gravely pointed <lb/>
            out by Socrates, and Gorgias who makes no attempt to <lb/>
            defend himself is allowed quietly to drop out of the dis- <lb/>
            cussion, in which he takes no further part except once or <lb/>
            twice as a deus ex machinâ to extricate the argument from <lb/>
            the dead-lock to which it has been brought by the obsti- <lb/>
            nacy of Callicles or some similar obstacle to its progress. <lb/>
            This carries us down to the end of the 15th chapter.</p>
          <p>So far we have been occupied with the definition of <lb/>
            Rhetoric; the argument now enters upon its second stage <lb/>
            and is consigned to the custody of Polus, the youthful <lb/>
            disciple of Gorgias, who shows himself in the course of it <lb/>
            inordinately vain, hot headed, intemperate, prone to exagge- <lb/>
            rate and moreover devoid of any deep or true insight into <lb/>
            the questions which he professes to be thoroughly acquainted <lb/>
            with, but withal upon the whole candid and tractable: he <lb/>
            yields himself an easy victim to the Socratic dialectics. The <lb/>
            general subject of this second division is the value of Rhetoric: <lb/>
             <pb n="XXXVII"/>
            what true power consists in, and what is the worth of that <lb/>
            which may be obtained by rhetoric.</p>
          <p>Breaking abruptly into the conversation in order to <lb/>
            rescue his master from the contradiction into which he <lb/>
            had fallen, and to show his own superiority to vulgar pre- <lb/>
            judice, Polus now asserts that teaching justice does not lie <lb/>
            within the province of rhetoric at all; and after some pre- <lb/>
            liminary sparring, and an awkward attempt on his part to <lb/>
            get at Socrates' own definition of the art, the latter at length <lb/>
            states, cc. 18, 19, 20, the famous distinction and classification <lb/>
            of true and false art, which Schleiermacher takes to be the <lb/>
            central idea and kernel of the dialogue; which, together with <lb/>
            what is implied in it and arises immediately out of it, gives <lb/>
            connection to the several parts of the dialogue itself and <lb/>
            to this dialogue with the whole series, and justifies the <lb/>
            position assigned to it at the head of his second division <lb/>
            of the Platonic writings. The eight arts which are occu- <lb/>
            pied with the treatment of the human body and soul may <lb/>
            be divided in various ways. Four deal with the body, <lb/>
            cookery1, personal embellishment (the tailor's, hairdresser's, <lb/>
            perfumer's, milliner's arts), medicine, and gymnastics; and <lb/>
            four with the soul, rhetoric, sophistic, justice (the admin- <lb/>
            istration of justice), and legislation: the four last come under <lb/>
            the general head of Politics: the first four have no collective <lb/>
            name. Secondly, four of them, two genuine and two spu- <lb/>
            rious arts, have a conservative and educational function, are <lb/>
            employed in training or pretending to train the body and mind, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κομμωτική</foreign>, gymnastics, sophistic, and legislation: the other <lb/>
            four, cookery, medicine, rhetoric and justice, are curative <lb/>
            or remedial, their office is to correct imperfections and restore <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀψοποιϊκή</foreign>, cookery, is not the art of the simple preparation of food, plain <lb/>

            imperfections of the food provided by nature by condiments and seasoning so <lb/>
            as to flatter or gratify the palate. Plato seems to be of the opinion with regard <lb/>
            to Cooks expressed in the familiar English proverb, that they are sent by the <lb/>

            Lastly, which is In fact the object of the entire classification, <lb/>
            four of them are true and genuine having the real good of <lb/>
            that which they profess to treat constantly in view, gym- <lb/>
            nastics, medicine, legislation, justice; and four are mere <lb/>

            aiming only at the outward show and not the substantial <lb/>
            reality of good; assuming the mask of the others to which <lb/>
            each severally corresponds, and deceiving by that assumption <lb/>
            those whom they pretend to serve. Hence we get the fol- <lb/>
            lowing proportion: <figure type="illustration">

          <p>Some of these terms speak for themselves, and require <lb/>
            no explanation. <foreign xml:lang="grc">νομοθετική</foreign>, legislation, is the principal <lb/>
            branch of the duty of a statesman or <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολιτική</foreign>, whose pro- <lb/>
            per office it is, as subsequently appears in this dialogue, <lb/>
            to train and educate the citizens committed to his charge <lb/>
            to the practice of all intellectual and moral virtue: this is <lb/>
            (imperfectly) effected by the laws and institutions of the <lb/>
            state, supplemented by a general system of education which <lb/>
            it is likewise the statesman's business to establish and super- <lb/>
            intend. See Aristotle's Politics, Bks. VII. VIII. (Bekk.), Plato's <lb/>
            Republic and Politicus, &amp;c. &amp;c. Of this true and genuine <lb/>
            art <foreign xml:lang="grc">σοφιστική</foreign> is the <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἴδωλον</foreign>, unreal image or counterfeit. <lb/>
            This pretends to effect what legislation really does, to lay <lb/>
            down moral rules for the regulation of life and conduct: and <lb/>
            the distinction here taken between this and rhetoric, is, as <lb/>
            Schleiermacher observes, Introd. to Gorg. p. 8, that sophistic <lb/>
            is represented as a sham philosophical art which lays down <lb/>
            and recognises first principles, by which the mind is shaped <lb/>
            and moulded as the body by gymnastics ; where as rhetoric <lb/>
            only applies these to individual cases, that is, as a remedial <lb/>
            art to the cure of a given corruption. Of Justice, <foreign xml:lang="grc">δικαιοσύνη</foreign>, <lb/>
             <pb n="XXXIX"/>
            standing here for <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίκη</foreign>, or rather <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίκη διορθωτική</foreign>, I have <lb/>
            spoken in the note to the translation p. 465, c. 20. Com- <lb/>
            pare Gorg. 478 A, B, which determines the precise meaning. <lb/>
            Stallbaum points out in his note on p. 464 B, that <foreign xml:lang="grc">δικαιοσύνη</foreign> <lb/>
            is elsewhere spoken of as an 'art'; Rep. I. 332 c, D, and <lb/>
            Erast. 137 D.</p>
          <p>Polus in his bungling attempt to carry on the argument <lb/>
            by putting questions to Socrates had been very anxious to <lb/>
            get him to admit that Rhetoric is a very fine thing because <lb/>
            it confers great power upon its possessor; he now endeavours <lb/>
            by the same argument to invalidate the contemptuous judg- <lb/>
            ment which his opponent has just pronounced upon it : how <lb/>
            can an art be a mere 'flattery' and a sham which may be <lb/>
            made the instrument of acquiring the supreme power in a <lb/>
            State? which enables its possessors to do what they please like <lb/>
            tyrants, and gratify all their passions and caprices at the <lb/>
            expense of their fellow-citizens ? The answer to this ques- <lb/>
            tion depends upon the proper definition of 'power.' True <lb/>
            power consists not in doing what we like or what we think <lb/>
            fit, but in doing what is really good for us: now what we <lb/>
            like and what we think fit is often not really beneficial but <lb/>
            injurious to us, and therefore to do that without considera- <lb/>
            tion of consequences indicates not strength or power, but <lb/>
            weakness. The mistake arises from a confusion of means <lb/>
            with ends. The only true and universal end of all action is <lb/>
            Good. The acts that Polus mentions as constituting power, <lb/>
            putting to death, robbing, banishing any one at pleasure, are <lb/>
            not in themselves good but only means to attain that end: <lb/>
            now if owing to want of wisdom or true insight the par- <lb/>
            ticular end which a man has in view in doing such acts be <lb/>
            a bad and not a good one, the acts are not desirable; he is <lb/>
            doing what he pleases, but not what he desires, which is good <lb/>
            alone, the end of all human action. But to do from ignorance <lb/>
            or want of self-control what one does not desire is a sign not <lb/>
            of strength but of weakness. Consequently unless the Rhe- <lb/>
            torician or the tyrant has a thorough knowledge of what is <lb/>
             <pb n="XL"/>
            good and evil, and knows how to choose the one and avoid <lb/>
            the other, his apparent power is a mere delusion, and a <lb/>
            despot may be in reality the weakest man in the realm, <lb/>
            cc. 21—24. Polus though unable to make any direct answer <lb/>
            to this, yet remains unconvinced and returns to the charge by <lb/>
            demanding whether Socrates himself would not be a tyrant <lb/>
            if lie could; explaining tyranny as before to mean the licence <lb/>
            to commit any arbitrary act at his pleasure. Socrates again <lb/>
            reminds him that regard must be had to consequences—that <lb/>
            such acts if followed by punishment for example are not de- <lb/>
            sirable, which Polus at once admits: and by the same rule <lb/>
            universally nothing is really desirable which is not attended <lb/>
            with good results, and that power like everything else must <lb/>
            be measured by this standard : good in this case means just <lb/>
            and right; if acts are right they are good, if wrong evil: <lb/>
            c. 25. Polus now as a final and conclusive argument tii- <lb/>
            umphantly quotes the case of Archelaus the usurper and <lb/>
            tyrant, who had earned by a series of the most atrocious <lb/>
            crimes not punishment but the throne of Macedonia, on <lb/>
            which he was then seated in the enjoyment of the greatest <lb/>
            happiness, that is splendour and prosperity, c. 26. Upon <lb/>
            this case issue is now joined, Polus asserting that happiness <lb/>
            is compatible with injustice and wrong, Socrates on the other <lb/>
            hand maintaining that the wrongdoer and unjust man is in <lb/>
            every case miserable, less miserable if he be brought to <lb/>
            justice and corrected by punishment, but most miserable <lb/>
            of all if he escape with impunity and so be encouraged to <lb/>
            continue in his wickedness, c. 28 init.: but in the following <lb/>
            argument the question is made to assume the form, in which <lb/>
            Socrates had already expressed it (c. 24, p. 469 B, c), whether <lb/>
            doing wrong or suffering it be worse.</p>
          <p>To supply a basis for the reasoning that follows Polus <lb/>
            the half-thinker is first made to admit, that although to <lb/>
            suffer wrong is worse, <foreign xml:lang="grc">κάκιον</foreign>, to do wrong is fouler, uglier, <lb/>
            more disgraceful, <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἴσχιον</foreign>. This he is quite ready to do ; for, <lb/>
            not having examined the grounds of his own opinions, and <lb/>
             <pb n="XLI"/>
            being in fact the representative of the popular unphiloso- <lb/>
            phical views of happiness in its relation to morality, though <lb/>
            he is persuaded that success in life however attained is the <lb/>
            highest good in one sense and man's highest aim, he is yet <lb/>
            not prepared to reject in terms those deeply rooted senti- <lb/>
            ments inherent in the human heart by which we approve of <lb/>
            what is right and condemn what is wrong, as such, and <lb/>
            irrespective of their consequences : though at the same time <lb/>
            he seems quite unconscious of what they really imply, and <lb/>
            does not allow them to exercise the smallest influence upon <lb/>
            the views of life which he adopts and recommends: and <lb/>
            secondly he accepts a definition of <foreign xml:lang="grc">καλόν</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἰσχρόν</foreign> pro- <lb/>
            posed by Socrates and established by a brief induction, which <lb/>
            makes the former consist in what is pleasant or profitable or <lb/>
            both, and the latter in the opposites. c. 30. Armed with <lb/>
            these two admissions Socrates speedily proves his point, that <lb/>
            since doing injustice is not more painful than suffering it, and <lb/>
            yet is fouler, i. e. by the definition either more painful or in- <lb/>
            jurious, it must be more injurious, and therefore worse : and <lb/>
            that consequently in saying that he himself or Polus or any <lb/>
            one else would prefer suffering wrong to doing it he was <lb/>
            maintaining no glaring paradox as Polus had supposed but <lb/>
            following the dictates of simple common sense, cc. 30, 31.</p>
          <p>On the general moral bearings of this argument the <lb/>
            principles therein appealed to and the terms employed, see <lb/>
            Dr Whewell's observations, Platonic Dialogues, II. 195—197.</p>
          <p>The validity of it rests upon the definition of <foreign xml:lang="grc">καλόν</foreign> and <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἰσχρόν</foreign>, and also upon the admission of a real distinction <lb/>
            between right and wrong and of the authority of those <lb/>
            sentiments of moral approbation and disapprobation with <lb/>
            which we instinctively regard them. When these are ad- <lb/>
            mitted the rest follows of course. The standard of 'good' <lb/>
            and ' bad,' <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγαθόν</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">κακόν</foreign>, on the other hand is utility or <lb/>
            one's own interest. Socrates in Xenophon's Memorabilia, <lb/>
            in. 8. 5, 6. IV. 6. 9, goes so far as to identify <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγαθόν</foreign> and <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">καλόν</foreign> in this sense. But utility or one's own interest may <lb/>
             <pb n="XLII"/>
            be regarded in two different aspects. There is an enlightened <lb/>
            self-interest which leads men to seek their real and abiding <lb/>
            good; and it is in this sense, as afterwards appears, p. 477 A, <lb/>
            and elsewhere in this dialogue, that justice is better than <lb/>
            injustice, however it may be attended with impunity and <lb/>
            crowned with success and worldly prosperity, because this <lb/>
            alone constitutes the soul's health, and is alone in conformity <lb/>
            with its real nature, being the principle of order harmony <lb/>
            strength and stability in the human constitution-as is more <lb/>
            largely set forth in the Republic -: and there is another and <lb/>
            a lower kind of it which looks merely to the acquisition <lb/>
            of power wealth station and other worldly advantages. The <lb/>
            latter is evidently Polus' notion of utility or self-interest, as <lb/>
            appears from what he had just before said; and therefore <lb/>
            when he admits that to do wrong is ugly or base he is, so <lb/>
            far as his conscious intention goes, merely using the current <lb/>
            popular language without observing the inconsistency with <lb/>
            his previously expressed views which the admission involves : <lb/>
            and when he assents so eagerly to the definition of <foreign xml:lang="grc">καλόν</foreign> <lb/>
            which describes it as pleasure or advantage, it is plain that <lb/>
            the advantages that he contemplates are such as those which <lb/>
            he has described with such gusto as enjoyed by Archelaus, <lb/>
            and not those which are understood by Socrates, the only <lb/>
            sense in which the definition is really applicable: and so he <lb/>
            drifts on unconsciously, entangled in the meshes of Socrates' <lb/>
            dialectical net, under this misunderstanding, to the conclu- <lb/>
            sions by which his assertions are upset and the other's point <lb/>
            established. The argument thus though logically sound <lb/>
            involves an essential unfairness. " Plato," as Mr Grote some- <lb/>
            where says, " is playing both games upon the chess-board," <lb/>
            and arranges the men and the moves at his pleasure. If <lb/>
            Polus had had his eyes open, like his successor Callicles, he <lb/>
            never would have admitted without distinction the positions <lb/>
            that lead to his discomfiture. He however serves the purpose <lb/>
            for which he is introduced into the dialogue, to represent <lb/>
            the opinion based upon no real knowledge or insight enter- <lb/>
             <pb n="XLIII"/>
            tained by the vulgar upon happiness the rule of life and <lb/>
            moral obligation, and the inconsistency of the principles which <lb/>
            men instinctively approve with those by which their prac- <lb/>
            tice and conduct are actually regulated : and it is left for his <lb/>
            successor Callicles to justify this selfish practice by theory, <lb/>
            and in so doing to reject all notions of duty and morality.</p>
          <p>The second ' paradox' that Socrates undertakes to prove <lb/>
            (476 A) is that impunity in wrong doing is the greatest <lb/>
            of all evils, greater than suffering punishment, or being <lb/>
            chastised and corrected (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κολάζεσθαι</foreign>), for one's offences. It is <lb/>
            first shown by induction, c. 32, that when any act is per- <lb/>
            formed it is performed upon some person or thing, that agent <lb/>
            necessarily implies patient, and that the quality or properties <lb/>
            of the act are the same in agent and patient, or that the <lb/>
            effect is of the same nature and character in the patient as <lb/>
            the action in the agent; consequently if a judge inflicts a <lb/>
            just punishment upon an offender the punishment as re- <lb/>
            ceived by the patient is likewise just, and if so <foreign xml:lang="grc">καλόν</foreign>, and if <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">καλὸν, ἀγαθόν</foreign>. Punishment therefore if just is good for the <lb/>
            recipient. The good or benefit which he receives, c. 33, is <lb/>
            correction and moral improvement which is effected by the <lb/>
            removal of the evil that had lodged in his soul and corrupted <lb/>
            it; and of the three restorative arts that apply a remedy <lb/>
            to the diseased condition of a man's mind body and estate, <lb/>
            trade medicine and corrective justice, as injustice and vice, <lb/>
            the disease of the soul, are far ' fouler' than poverty and sick- <lb/>
            ness, the diseases incident to a man's fortunes and body, and <lb/>
            yet not so painful, it follows again, from the definition of <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">καλόν</foreign>, that the soul's disease must be an enormously greater <lb/>
            evil than the other two and the justice or punishment which <lb/>
            rids us of it infinitely to be preferred to all other blessings. <lb/>
            So far therefore from shunning and trying to escape justice, <lb/>
            the wicked man should eagerly have recourse to the judge, <lb/>
            as the sick man to the physician1, in order to be rid of his <note type="footnote"> 1 On this false analogy, which in fact vitiates the entire reasoning, for if <lb/>
            punishment does not cure or eradicate vice, as the physician's art disease, if no </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="XLIV"/>
            wickedness the greatest of all calamities which must needs <lb/>
            render him miserable. And the general conclusion now is, <lb/>
            c. 35, 479 D, that injustice and wrong-doing is only second in <lb/>
            the degrees of evil, "to do wrong and escape the penalty <lb/>
            is the first and greatest of all ills," and by this we may <lb/>
            estimate the amount of real happiness enjoyed by Archelaus <lb/>
            and those who like him have committed the most enormous <lb/>
            crimes without repentance and atonement, and the value <lb/>
            of the maxims and principles by which Polus thought that a <lb/>
            man's conduct and pursuits in life should be guided.</p>
          <p>Or the result may be stated thus: Vice and injustice are <lb/>
            the disease of the soul—comp. Rep. x. 608 E, foll.—the <lb/>
            noblest part of man, and therefore, as corruptio optimi fit <lb/>
            pessima, the worst thing that can happen to a man: 'justice' <lb/>
            is the natural remedy for this: accordingly just as a man in <lb/>
            good health is in the best case, but if he be afflicted with a <lb/>
            disease the next best thing is to apply a remedy and get rid <lb/>
            of it, so that man is to be most envied whose soul and moral <lb/>
            condition are sound and healthy; he is happy in the next <lb/>
            degree who is cured of his vice by correction and punish- <lb/>
            ment; he most wretched of all who having a soul polluted <lb/>
            and depraved with crime remains undetected and unpunished <lb/>
            until the ulcer and the disease have become inveterate and <lb/>
            incurable. Finally the only legitimate use of rhetoric is not <lb/>
            as Polus maintains to excuse and palliate iniquity and avert <lb/>
            from oneself and friends its due penalty, but rather to bring <lb/>
            our hidden crimes to light and expose the guilty to the <lb/>
            correction which may operate as a cure1. Comp. Rep. IX. <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>This brings us down to the end of c. 36, p. 481 B, and <lb/>
            concludes the second division of the argument.</p>
          <p>Polus being thus reduced to silence Collides now steps <lb/>
            forward to the rescue, and the argument enters upon its <lb/>
            third stage. He first accuses Polus in his turn of timidity <lb/>
            and over deference to popular prejudices, and then turning <lb/>
            upon Socrates charges him with wilful sophistry in availing <lb/>
            himself of the ambiguity of the word ' right,' which is em- <lb/>
            ployed in two different significations according as 'natural' <lb/>
            or 'legal and conventional' right is thereby intended. When <lb/>
            Socrates declares that wrong doing is an evil and worse than <lb/>
            wrong suffering he is speaking according to law' or 'con- <lb/>
            vention;' whereas 'by nature' the opposite is true. In ex- <lb/>
            planation of this he propounds his theory. All distinctions <lb/>
            which imply moral approbation or disapprobation are now <lb/>
            swept away; 'by nature' every thing is 'fouler' more dis- <lb/>
            graceful which is also 'worse' more injurious, and therefore <lb/>
            suffering wrong: to endure injury or insult without the <lb/>
            power of helping oneself is unmanly and fit only for a slave; <lb/>
            for such an one it is better to die than to live. The notion <lb/>
            that to suffer wrong is better and nobler than to inflict it <lb/>
            and such like are the inventions of the weaker majority who <lb/>
            constitute society; these have agreed amongst themselves to <lb/>
            encourage such opinions, and to frame their laws in accord- <note type="footnote"> able, and thus ruin him body and soul. It is true that the Greek moralists <lb/>
            generally admitted the principle of doing good to one's friends and evil to one's <lb/>
            enemies as a maxim of their moral code; and this is one of the most striking <lb/>
            of all the points of difference between heathen and Christian morals; but none <lb/>
            of them it may safely be affirmed would have ventured to go such lengths as <lb/>
            to include the promotion of injustice and vice amongst the allowable injuries <lb/>
            that might be inflicted on an enemy. The case is merely a supposed one. If <lb/>
            we desired to do an enemy all the mischief in our power, this is the way in <lb/>
            which we should proceed. If any doubt remained on the point, it would be <lb/>
            removed by the following passage of the Republic, I. 335 B, D: <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνθρώπους δὲ μὴ</foreign> </note> <figure type="illustration">

              ance with them, in order to protect themselves against the <lb/>
              superior or stronger, whose natural right it is to be their <lb/>
              lord and master, to gratify all his impulses and passions, and <lb/>
              in short to do as he pleases: and this is natural justice. c. 38. <lb/>
              The rest of his speech is occupied first in defending this po- <lb/>
              sition and in depicting the triumph of this natural right <lb/>
              when the stronger has shaken off the chains imposed upon <lb/>
              hint by society and its conventions, when like a horse that has <lb/>
              broken loose he has burst his bonds and flung his rider and <lb/>
              escaped from human control, and rises in his might to assert <lb/>
              his natural superiority, and trample under foot the feeble <lb/>
              restraints that bound him, c. 39; and secondly, cc. 40, 41, <lb/>

              voted to philosophy and the utter helplessness, the liability <lb/>
              to every insult and death itself, which attends it; and an <lb/>
              earnest recommendation to Socrates (who here stands for <lb/>
              Plato himself) to renounce this childish study and betake <lb/>
              himself to more manly and useful pursuits, the career of the <lb/>
              rhetorician or politician.</p>
          <p>The theory of society and of morals here set forth seems <lb/>
            to agree substantially with that propounded by Thrasyma- <lb/>
            chus in the Republic, Book I. Mr Grote however, Hist. of <lb/>
            Greece, VIII. 537 (Ed. 2), maintains that it is ' essentially <lb/>
            different;' but I think the difference between them lies ra- <lb/>
            ther in the point of view from which 'conventional' right and <lb/>
            justice are looked at, and the terms in which the theories <lb/>
            are stated, than in the principles on which they are based <lb/>
            and the views of society and moral obligation which they <lb/>
            imply. Thrasymachus, it is true, says nothing about ' right.' <lb/>
            His theory is—I will adopt the terms in which Mr Grote <lb/>
            himself expresses it, p. 536—' that justice is the interest of <lb/>
            the superior power; that rule, which in every society the <lb/>
            dominant power prescribes as being for its own advantage. <lb/>
            A man is just for the advantage of another, not for his own: <lb/>
            lie is weak, cannot help himself, and must submit to that <lb/>
            which the stronger authority, whether despot oligarchy or <lb/>
             <pb n="XLVII"/>
            commonwealth, commands.' But surely this implies a 'na- <lb/>
            tural right' in the stronger or superior to avail themselves <lb/>
            of the advantages thus offered to them: right must reside <lb/>
            somewhere; and by Thrasymachus' theory it resides in the <lb/>
            governing body, whatever its special form may be, which <lb/>
            enacts laws establishes institutions and inculcates notions in <lb/>
            accordance with its own interests, that is, for the mainte- <lb/>
            nance of its authority. It is true again that according to <lb/>
            Thrasymachus the conventions which dictate the opinions <lb/>
            and rules by which man's conduct is regulated proceed from <lb/>
            the stronger, and are established for the purpose of ensuring <lb/>
            the obedience of the weaker or governed: whereas in Calli- <lb/>
            cles' view they arise out of the fears of the weaker majority <lb/>
            to hold the stronger in check and prevent him from breaking <lb/>
            loose and asserting his natural right to their obedience; in <lb/>
            the one justice, conventional justice, is the interest of the <lb/>
            stronger, in the other the interest of the weaker: still the <lb/>
            fundamental conception of law and right and the effect pro- <lb/>
            duced is the same in either case; justice and right as men <lb/>
            commonly conceive them are equally delusive equally devoid <lb/>
            of any natural and inherent claim to respect and observance; <lb/>
            the stronger overrides them, establishes and alters them at <lb/>
            his pleasure, either by natural right which renders him <lb/>
            superior to all conventions, or (which seems in fact to come <lb/>
            to much the same thing) because he has himself introduced <lb/>
            and can deal with them as he pleases: in both alike they are <lb/>
            mere human inventions and result in the established order of <lb/>
            society1. Thrasymachus' views are stated and discussed in <note type="footnote">1 A question of this kind must be decided by reason and not authority. <lb/>
            But it may be as well to observe that at least three writers on this subject <lb/>
            whose opinion is deserving of the very highest consideration and respect seem <lb/>
            to agree, if not in identifying the two theories, at any rate in tracing in them <lb/>
            a very close resemblance. Brandis in his Handbuch, Vol. II. p. 464, note kk, <lb/>
            places Rep. I. 338 C side by side with Gorg. 482 E, 483 A, without comment, as <lb/>
            authorities for the following words of his text. Da aber der verwegenere <lb/>

          <p>In Xenophon's Memorabilia, IV. 4. 14, Hippias argues <lb/>

            ventional ; compare also the doctrines attributed to Prota- <lb/>
            goras in the Theætetus, pp. 1G7 C, 172 B. The same views <lb/>
            are ascribed to the Sophists (as I have endeavoured to show, <lb/>
            Journal of Classical and Sacred Philology, No. 2, pp. 155— <lb/>

            circumstances of time and place, that there is no natural <lb/>
            right, unless it be that of the stronger, and that consequently <lb/>
            every one has a right to get what he can and keep what he <lb/>
            can get—“ the simple plan, that they should take who have <lb/>
            the power and they should keep who can "-was revived by <lb/>
            Carneades, the most celebrated of the Sceptical philosophers <lb/>
            of the New Academy, in a famous argumentation delivered <lb/>
            during his embassy at Rome in B.C. 156, and reported by <lb/>
            Cicero in the third book of his treatise de Republica, of which <note type="footnote"> ersteres auf das Recht des Stärkeren zurückführt, &amp;c. And again, p. 470, in <lb/>
            examining the theory as stated by Thrasymachus in the Republic, he speaks of <lb/>
            die ähnliche Behauptung des Kallikles im Gorgias. And Schleiermacher, In- <lb/>
            trod. to Republic, p. 8, has, Und wenn allerdings das Thema des Thrasymachos <lb/>
            auch sehr bestimmt an den Gorgias erinnert, and immediately afterwards <lb/>
            speaks of the ähnlichkeit between them. As one of Schleiermacher’s principal <lb/>
            objects in his Introductions is to show how the later dialogues were developed <lb/>
            out of germs already contained in the earlier ones, or carry on the same trains <lb/>
            of thought, these expressions are at all events sufficient to show that he could <lb/>
            not have found an 'essential difference ' between the two theories in question. <lb/>
            Lastly Zeller, Phil. der Griechen, Vol. I. p. 260, 1st ed. Die Sophistik, after <lb/>
            referring to the doctrine of Thrasymachus in the Republic, proceeds thus, am <lb/>

            schüler Kallikles entwickelt. </note> <lb/>

            a few fragments still remain. Fragmm. VIII—XVIII. The <lb/>
            summary of it is supplied by Lactantius in these terms. <lb/>
            Fragm. xv. "That men established for themselves a system <lb/>
            of law or rights in conformity with their interests, that is to <lb/>
            say, varying according to their habits and. customs, and often <lb/>
            changed as circumstances required amongst the same people : <lb/>
            natural right there is none. All men as well as other living <lb/>
            creatures are impelled by the very guidance of nature to seek <lb/>
            their own advantage; therefore either there is no such thing <lb/>
            as justice, or if there be any, it is the height of folly, since it <lb/>
            hurts itself in consulting the interests of others (here he is in <lb/>
            entire agreement with Thrasymachus). All people who ever <lb/>
            enjoyed a flourishing empire, in fact the Romans themselves, <lb/>
            who hold the sovereignty of the whole globe, if they mean to <lb/>
            be just, that is to make restitution of what belongs to others, <lb/>
            must return to their original cabins and lie prostrate in <lb/>
            poverty and misery." And further, Fragm. XIV. " As one <lb/>
            man and one order is afraid of another, and again no one can <lb/>
            rely upon himself, a sort of compact is made between the <lb/>
            mass of the people and the powerful, from which arises the <lb/>
            association of civil society. For it is weakness and not na- <lb/>
            ture nor free will that is the mother of justice. For whereas <lb/>
            our choice has to be made out of three things; either to do <lb/>
            wrong and not suffer it, or to do and suffer it, or neither; <lb/>
            the best of all is to do wrong with impunity if you can; the <lb/>
            second best neither to do nor to suffer it; the most wretched <lb/>
            of all lots is to be in a perpetual conflict of inflicting and <lb/>
            suffering injuries."</p>
          <p>Similar doctrines of the origin and nature of justice law <lb/>
            and right were reasserted in the seventeenth century by <lb/>
            Hobbes of Malmesbury, whose theory is absolutely identical <lb/>
            with that laid down by Callicles. He maintained in his Le- <lb/>
            viathan that right and wrong have no independent existence: <lb/>
            that the natural state of mankind is one of mutual war; <lb/>
            and that consequently the notions of right and wrong, just <lb/>
            and unjust, have there no place: these spring from the union <note type="footnote"> d </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="L"/>
            of individuals in society, whence proceeds positive law, a <lb/>
            convention which establishes right and wrong in and for that <lb/>
            society. Right is the power of enforcing; duty the necessity <lb/>
            of obeying. See further in Dr Whewell’s Hist. of Mor. Phil. <lb/>
            in Engl. p. 17. Compare p. 52. " Hobbes had maintained <lb/>
            that the state of the nature of man is an universal war of <lb/>
            each against all; and that there is no such thing as natural <lb/>
            right and justice (that is, of course, in the ordinary sense) ; <lb/>
            these notions being only creations of civil society, and de- <lb/>
            riving their sanction entirely from the civil ruler.” See <lb/>
            likewise Mackintosh, Dissert. on the Hist. of Eth. Phil., p. 122 <lb/>
            (Ed. Whewell); and on Spinosa's Views, Ibid. p. 124.</p>
          <p>In the following chapter, 42, Socrates is occupied chiefly <lb/>
            in quizzing Callicles for the uncompromising freespokenness <lb/>
            with which he has stated his theory, and the judicious advice <lb/>
            which he has so kindly and gratuitously bestowed upon him. <lb/>
            Fun to all appearance is its principal, if not sole, object; <lb/>
            and it seems to require no other justification than the hu- <lb/>
            mour that pervades it of its introduction here, though the <lb/>
            argument be not directly advanced thereby. There be how- <lb/>
            ever Teutonic writers who see in it a deeper meaning; and <lb/>
            conceive that we are to understand by the compliments <lb/>
            which Socrates pays to Callicles on his candour, wisdom, and <lb/>
            kind feeling towards himself, that he has now found a worthy <lb/>
            antagonist with whom he can go deeper into the questions <lb/>
            proposed for discussion.</p>
          <p>The argument is resumed in chapter 43, and the examina- <lb/>
            tion of Callicles' theory commenced. But first it is necessary <lb/>
            to state it a little more distinctly, and explain the meaning <lb/>
            of the terms in which it is expressed. What for instance does <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κρέιττων</foreign> ' superior' mean ? Callicles first says, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰσχυρότερος</foreign>, <lb/>
            meaning doubtless to include all the resources of ability and <lb/>
            power in the notion of strength. Socrates however confines <lb/>
            it to its literal sense; and in this limited application to mere <lb/>
            strength of body it immediately appears that the many or <lb/>
            individually weaker are superior to the one stronger in whom <lb/>
             <pb n="LI"/>
            the natural right resides, and therefore according to this view <lb/>
            of the case they have the right and not he. Callicles at once <lb/>
            abandons this, c. 44, and proposes <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀμείνων</foreign> as a substitute, <lb/>
            but this is just as vague as the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">κρείττων</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">βελτίων</foreign> <lb/>
            which it proposes to explain; and he then suggests <foreign xml:lang="grc">φρονι- <lb/>
            μώτερος</foreign>, that the superiority which gives the natural right <lb/>
            resides in practical wisdom and sagacity, skill and knowledge. <lb/>
            It is soon found, c. 45, that neither do these qualities entitle <lb/>
            their possessor to an advantage over his fellows or an undue <lb/>
            share in any of the good things of this life; and then Calli- <lb/>
            cles finally pronounces that the strength and superiority that <lb/>
            he really means lies in a union of the highest qualities of the <lb/>
            statesman, the knowledge and skill to form plans (for the <lb/>
            public good and his own) or to frame a policy, and the energy <lb/>
            and vigour to carry them into execution. " These are the <lb/>
            men that have a right to bear rule, and justice consists in <lb/>
            this, that these should have the advantage over the rest, <lb/>
            the governors over the governed." c. 46, p. 491 D. Socrates <lb/>
            takes occasion by this to inquire who these governors and <lb/>
            governed are ? whether the notion of self-government is in- <lb/>
            cluded? and thus the subject of <foreign xml:lang="grc">σωφροσύνη</foreign> or self-control is <lb/>
            introduced, and the transition made to the next question, <lb/>
            the contrast between this and the unrestrained and unlimited <lb/>
            indulgence of the appetites and desires, and which of the two <lb/>
            conduces to virtue and happiness. Hereupon Callicles aban- <lb/>
            dons all reserve, and plainly states that a man's duty and <lb/>
            happiness consists in the gratification of all his desires 1, which <lb/>
            he is therefore bound to foster and encourage, provided only <lb/>
            he have the means of satisfying them, and this is to be sought <lb/>
            in absolute power.</p>
          <p>Socrates, c. 47, after commending Callicles' frankness in <lb/>
            speaking so boldly out what other people often think but <lb/>
            don't usually choose to express, first, cc. 47, 48, in two fables <lb/>
            or allegories, derived most probably from the Orphics and <note type="footnote"> 1 This is what Demosthenes calls, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῇ γαστρὶ μετρεῖν τὴν εὐδαιμονίαν</foreign>, de Cor. <lb/>

            a comparatively serious and searching examination of the <lb/>
            question virtually involved in the original theory put forth <lb/>
            by Callicles, but now more immediately raised by his recent <lb/>
            explanations, that is, the nature of pleasure and its relation <lb/>
            to the good.</p>
          <p>The treatment of this subject however in our dialogue is <lb/>
            still dialectical and somewhat popular and negative. Plato's <lb/>
            maturer views upon the question are to be found in the <lb/>
            Philebus, to which the argument of the Gorgias may be <lb/>
            regarded in some sort as introductory, where pleasure is <lb/>
            submitted to a more thorough and fundamental analysis, <lb/>
            its true nature and distinctions determined, and its relation <lb/>
            to the ultimate good and the rank which is consequently to <lb/>
            be assigned to it in the scale of goods finally and definitively <lb/>
            settled.</p>
          <p>It follows immediately from what Callicles has already <lb/>
            said that he regards pleasure as the only good, and it now <lb/>
            appears, c. 49, that he makes no distinction between the dif- <lb/>
            ferent kinds of pleasure; all alike are good, every appetite <lb/>
            and desire is alike worthy of satisfaction.</p>
          <p>The views here put forward in the person of Callicles are <lb/>
            in fact those of Aristippus and the Cyrenaics, upon whom <lb/>
            see Zeller, Phil. der Gr. I. 120, foil. Some of them seem to <lb/>
            have pushed their theory to the same extreme lengths as <lb/>
            Callicles does here, for Diogenes Laert. II. 87, says. that they <lb/>
            held <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴ διαφέρειν ἡδονὴν ἡδονῆς μηδὲ ἥδιόν τι εἶναι</foreign> : though <lb/>
            he afterwards ascribes to Aristippus, § 90, the milder doc- <lb/>
            trine of a gradation of pleasures. The same is spoken of <lb/>
             <pb n="LIII"/>
            as the popular view, Rep. VI. 505 B, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοῖς πολλοῖς ἡδονὴ δοκεῖ <lb/>
            εἶνατ</foreign> To <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγαθόν</foreign>. It is often by modern writers ascribed to <lb/>
            the Sophists: and though we have I believe no direct ancient <lb/>
            authority for this, still'it is an easy deduction from the moral <lb/>
            theories and views of life which they entertained. The <lb/>
            ancient authorities for the doctrines of Aristippus may be <lb/>
            seen in Stallbaum's Introd. to Phileb. p. 23. Ed. 1.</p>
          <p>The first argument against the identity of pleasure and <lb/>
            good occupies cc. 50, 51, and part of 52, to p. 497 D. It is to <lb/>
            this effect. Good and bad, it is admitted, like health and <lb/>
            disease, strength and weakness, speed and slowness, are <lb/>
            opposites, and as such mutually exclude one another, that is, <lb/>
            they cannot reside together in the same subject and the same <lb/>
            part of it at the same time and place and under the same <lb/>
            circumstances. Now from the nature of pleasure, that is <lb/>
            sensual corporeal pleasure which alone is here in question, <lb/>
            this cannot be asserted of pleasure and pain. On the con- <lb/>
            trary, the gratification of a bodily appetite consists in the <lb/>
            relief of a want, the filling up of a gap, the supply of a <lb/>
            deficiency of a certain part of the body, or of the entire <lb/>
            bodily constitution, and the restoration of the whole system <lb/>
            to the normal harmony of its condition. But we relieve <lb/>
            distress, and a want is painful, and therefore in gratifying <lb/>
            an appetite we feel pain and pleasure together; and not only <lb/>
            so, but the two cease simultaneously, as in drinking the thirst <lb/>
            or pain and the pleasure that arises from drinking by which <lb/>
            that pain is relieved, 497 A; and therefore pleasure and pain <lb/>
            since they coexist in the same subject and the same part of <lb/>
            it cannot be identical with good or evil.</p>
          <p>The same view of the nature of the pleasures of sense is <lb/>
            expressed in a more dogmatic form in the Philebus, p. 31 D. <lb/>
            Pain is there made to consist in the <foreign xml:lang="grc">λύσις τῆς ἁρμονίας</foreign> of the <lb/>
            bodily frame, pleasure in the restoration of this balance or <lb/>
            harmony, in the filling up of the void produced by this disso- <lb/>
            lution. Compare 32 B, 42 C, D: and Timæus, p. 64 D, where <lb/>
            pain is similarly referred to a violent disturbance of the <lb/>
             <pb n="LIV"/>
            natural order, TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρὰ φύσιν καὶ βίαιον γιγνόμενον ἄθροον <lb/>
            παρ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡμῖν πάθος ἀλγεινόν</foreign>; and pleasure to a return to ‘ na- <lb/>
            ture,' that is the restoration of the natural order and liar- <lb/>
            mony; and some further details are added on the same <lb/>
            subject. Compare also Republic, IX.585 A, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πεῖνα καὶ δίψα <lb/>
            καὶ</foreign> Ta <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοιαυ̑τα κενώσεις τινές εἰσι τῆς περὶ</foreign> TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">σῶμα ἕξεως</foreign>. <lb/>
            584 C, <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴ πειθώμεθα καθαρὰν ἡδονὴν εἶναι τὴν λύπης ἀπαλ- <lb/>
            λαγήν</foreign>. In the entire passage on this subject Rep. IX. 583 B— <lb/>
            586 c, the conclusions of the Philebus seem to be assumed. <lb/>
            In the scale of goods which is the general result of the dis- <lb/>
            cussions of the Philebus, 66 A, to the end, the pure and <lb/>
            painless pleasures of the intellect and imagination-and affec- <lb/>
            tions, which might have been added, but are not (comp. <lb/>
            p. 52 c)—in which sense has no direct share, except in certain <lb/>
            cases as a medium, occupy the fifth and lowest place; sensual <lb/>
            pleasures, which belong to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄπειρον</foreign> or indefinite, the <lb/>
            fleeting shifting unstable element of the greater and less, <lb/>
            the principle therefore of all excess and defect-as opposed <lb/>
            to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέσον</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέτριον</foreign>, the highest of all goods-are the <lb/>
            causes only of excess and disturbance, and therefore excluded <lb/>
            altogether from the catalogue of good things.</p>
          <p>The second argument, cc. 52 p. 497 D, and 53, is as fol- <lb/>
            lows. If pleasure is the only good and pain the only evil, <lb/>
            good and bad men will be distinguished only by the amount <lb/>
            of pleasure and pain they feel. But experience shows that <lb/>
            bad men, as fools and cowards, feel quite as much or even <lb/>
            more pleasure-as a coward for example in escaping danger- <lb/>
            that is, by the hypothesis, are as good or better, than the <lb/>
            wise and brave who are good: which is absurd. The same <lb/>
            reductio ad absurdum is thus briefly stated, Phileb. 55 B: <lb/>
            " How absurd it would be for a man when be feels pain <lb/>
            to be obliged to say that he is then a bad man, though he <lb/>
            may be the most virtuous person in the world, and vice <lb/>
            versa."</p>
          <p>Again, when Callicles abandons his former ground and <lb/>
            endeavours to avoid the conclusion by accepting the dis- <lb/>
             <pb n="LV"/>
            tinction of good and bad pleasures, Socrates immediately <lb/>
            shows him that if some pleasures are to be avoided because <lb/>
            they are useless or injurious, it is not pleasure per se that <lb/>
            men seek when they indulge themselves, but profit or advan- <lb/>
            tage ; or, that if they are persuaded that the evil conse- <lb/>
            quences of an indulgence overbalance the pleasure they feel <lb/>
            in it, they abstain. Consequently it is not pleasure that is <lb/>
            men's real object, but good, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ἀγαθόν</foreign>, the ultimate end of <lb/>
            all human action, c. 54.</p>
          <p>In the following Chapter, 55, p. 500 B, these conclusions <lb/>
            are connected by another link with the general subject of <lb/>
            the dialogue, and employed in confirmation of the positions <lb/>
            laid down in the course of the arguments with Gorgias and <lb/>
            Polus. The distinction just established between pleasure and <lb/>
            good justifies that which was previously assumed without <lb/>
            proof between the spurious and genuine arts, and is now <lb/>
            directly applied to these, and to politics in general under <lb/>
            the name of rhetoric, the thread on which the entire argu- <lb/>
            ment is made to hang, cc. 56—58. Socrates is now enabled <lb/>
            to reassert more confidently and with a deeper meaning the <lb/>
            views then put forward rather tentatively and hypothetically. <lb/>
            The spurious art of politics, as it was interpreted by Callicles <lb/>
            and the Sophists, aims only at pleasure, that is, at gratifying <lb/>
            the passions and vanity of him who practises the art-this <lb/>
            may be included in the notion of 'flattery,' though it is <lb/>
            not expressly mentioned-and tickling the ears of the mob <lb/>
            to whom it is addressed, humouring them like children <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὥσπερ παισὶ χαριζόμενον</foreign>, 502 E); and this has been shown <lb/>
            not to be the good. Whence it appears that its aim must <lb/>
            be a wrong one, and requires to be rectified by the study <lb/>
            of philosophy or dialectics, the only true art of words <lb/>
            (Phædr. 261 E), and the only genuine qualification for <lb/>
            public life.</p>
          <p>This is to be taken together with a great deal of what <lb/>
            follows, as Schleiermacher first pointed out, as an implied <lb/>
            justification of Plato's own abstinence from public affairs, <lb/>
             <pb n="LVI"/>
            or rather neglect of his public duties, and exclusive devotion <lb/>
            to philosophical speculation, with which his enemies seem <lb/>
            to have reproached him 1, and may accordingly be compared <lb/>
            with the two more celebrated passages of a similar tendency, <lb/>
            Theætetus, 172 C—177 C, and Republic, VI. 488 A—497 A (and <lb/>
            the following), especially 49G C—E, where Plato is manifestly <lb/>
            drawing a picture of himself, his own feelings and position; <lb/>
            and also with the 7th Epistle in which either himself or <lb/>
            some one well acquainted with him and his history describes <lb/>
            the motives by which he was led to abstain from politics and <lb/>
            the feelings which he entertained towards all existing govern- <lb/>
            ments. The duty of a philosopher in this particular, and the <lb/>
            reasons, founded upon the views of justice and happiness and <lb/>
            man’s moral constitution previously developed in the course <lb/>
            of the dialogue, which will determine his choice of a career <lb/>
            in life, are stated still more explicitly, Rep. IX. 591 E, to the <lb/>
            end. And in Politicus, 299 A, the young Socrates seems to <lb/>
            express Plato's own sentiments when he exclaims after hear- <lb/>
            ing the Eleatic Stranger's description of certain existing in- <lb/>
            stitutions, <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐκου̑ν ὅγ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐθέλων καὶ ἑκὼν ἐν</foreign> TO?? <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοιούτοις ἄρχειν <lb/>
            δικαιότατ ἄνὁτιου̑ν πάθοι καὶ ἀποτίνοι</foreign>.</p>
          <p>It must be owned that in all this the great Moralist <lb/>
            exhibits a somewhat singular unconsciousness that all these <lb/>
            fine motives and reasons are mere selfishness very thinly <note type="footnote"> 1 This apology which Plato here makes for himself, and the announcement <lb/>
            of his determination to persevere in the course of life which he had marked <lb/>
            out, combined with other reasons, have led Schleiermacher to refer the composi- <lb/>
            tion of the dialogue to Plato's return from his first journey to Sicily in 389 B.C., <lb/>
            at the age of 40, after which he settled in Athens and opened his philosophical <lb/>
            school, as the period most suitable to such a defence and statement of his <lb/>
            intentions. Schleiermacher thinks that Plato did not return to Athens "for <lb/>
            any long time at least" after his residence at Megara. Professor Thompson <lb/>
            (quoted by Dr Donaldson, Continuation of Müll. Hist. Gr. Lit. II. 51—54) in <lb/>
            accordance with the usual opinion, derived from Diogenes Laertius, that Plato <lb/>
            returned to Athens, after his first absence, in 395 B.C., fixes the date of com- <lb/>
            position at an earlier period, between his return from his travels after his <lb/>
            residence at Megara and his first journey to Sicily in 389. </note> <lb/>

            disguised; a simple unwillingness to sacrifice his own ease <lb/>
            comfort and pursuits to a possible public duty, with a con- <lb/>
            siderable admixture of spite and scorn for the existing <lb/>
            government and policy of his native country. Not that I <lb/>
            would affirm that he was not in reality better employed, and <lb/>
            conferring more benefit on the world at large, in speculating <lb/>
            on the true the good and the beautiful than in humbling <lb/>
            the pride of the great King, or invading Laconia (for which <lb/>
            however it would seem from the allusion, Gorg. 515 E, and <lb/>
            his expressions elsewhere, he would have had no particular <lb/>
            inclination) at the head of a combined force of Athenians and <lb/>
            Thebans, or in arguing with some Callicles before the public <lb/>
            assembly about ships long walls docks and such like 'nonsense;' <lb/>
            but that he seems to overlook the possibility of a man’s being <lb/>
            obliged by his duty as a citizen and a patriot to make the <lb/>
            sacrifice of his own inclinations and prepossessions to the <lb/>
            interests of his country, to serve which he himself tells us so <lb/>
            often is paramount over all other obligations; or again that <lb/>
            if the state of society at Athens was really as corrupt as he <lb/>
            deemed it to be, it might be his business actively to aid in <lb/>
            improving it, even at the risk of destroying the balance or <lb/>
            dissolving the harmony (Rep. IX. 592 A) of his soul thereby. <lb/>
            This appears in fact to be one of the numerous instances <lb/>
            in which great philosophers-need I refer to the case of <lb/>
            Bacon ?-see clearly enough what duty requires in others, <lb/>
            but are unable to apply their own rules to their own indi- <lb/>
            vidual circumstances.</p>
          <p>With rhetoric are included in the same category as arts <lb/>
            of flattery other highly esteemed and popular arts, as the <lb/>
            various kinds of music, dithyrambic and even tragic poetry, <lb/>
            which have pleasure only for their object: and here again <lb/>
            we seem to have an anticipation of the discussions of the <lb/>
            Republic, Books II. in. and X., which end in the exclu- <lb/>
            sion from the model state of poetry and music, with the <lb/>
            exception of the simplest and gravest branches of those arts. <lb/>
            Gorg. 502 D.</p><pb n="LVIII"/>
            
          <p>Continuing, c. 58, to apply the principles thus gradually <lb/>
            established to the solution of the main question, what is the <lb/>
            true rule of life, Socrates, after having shown that the real <lb/>
            end and aim of human action is not pleasure nor external <lb/>
            advantage, and therefore not power, but good, now infers <lb/>
            that this must likewise be the end and aim of all education, <lb/>
            and with it of political education or the statesman’s art. A <lb/>
            man's private duty is therefore to aim at becoming good <lb/>
            himself, and his public duty to endeavour to make others so. <lb/>
            And herein lies the explanation of the failure of past and <lb/>
            present statesmen alike in fulfilling the true object of their <lb/>
            profession, which is to make men better, that they have been <lb/>
            ignorant of this great truth that good is to be preferred to <lb/>
            immediate gratification and external power and splendour, <lb/>
            and so have mistaken their end and followed a wrong course <lb/>
            and left the citizens as bad or worse than they found <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>Next follows, c. 59, an inquiry into the means by which <lb/>
            men are to be made good, and what it is that constitutes <lb/>
            soundness, health, goodness in man's moral constitution. It <lb/>
            appears, by the analogy of the arts as usual, that every artist <lb/>
            in dealing with his materials and shaping them to his end, <lb/>
            has in his mind a certain order and arrangement or settled <lb/>
            plan to which all that he uses and all that he does is sub- <lb/>
            ordinate and made to conform; it is this order and harmony <lb/>
            and right arrangement that constitutes the ‘goodness’ of a <lb/>
            house, a ship, the strength and health of the human body, <lb/>
            and so by analogy, the virtue or excellence of the soul. The <lb/>
            result of this order in the soul is obedience to law, by it <lb/>
            men are made observant of law and orderly; and this is <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">δικαιοσύνη</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">σωφροσύνη</foreign>, justice and self-control, 504 D. <lb/>
            To the same rule, c. 60, the rhetorician or statesman must <lb/>
            likewise conform. The true, scientific, orator and statesman, <lb/>
            one who really understands his profession its ends and obli- <lb/>
            gations, must before all things seek to implant these vir- <lb/>
            tues in the souls of those who are entrusted to his charge. <lb/>
             <pb n="LIX"/>
            Accordingly he must control their inclinations, correct and <lb/>
            chastise them, which is the only way in which their character <lb/>
            can be really improved, instead of trying to gratify, humour, <lb/>
            and indulge them, which Callicles thought to be the poli- <lb/>
            tician's object; and so it is not <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀκολασία</foreign> unlimited unre- <lb/>
            strained indulgence of the appetites and desires, but the <lb/>
            opposite, <foreign xml:lang="grc">κολάζεσθαι</foreign>, correction and control, which is a man's <lb/>
            true object, alike as a statesman or a private citizen, 505 c. <lb/>
            Here Callicles, who is fairly silenced and can no longer find <lb/>
            any argument or subterfuge to serve his purpose, becomes <lb/>
            sulky and obstinate, and flatly refuses to continue the dis- <lb/>
            cussion. He now suggests, c. 61, that Socrates should carry <lb/>
            it on by himself, which after a show of modest hesitation <lb/>
            and reluctance, and earnest entreaties to his friends to be <lb/>
            very hard upon him and carefully to note and criticise any <lb/>
            error he falls into, and by the intervention of the Deus ex <lb/>
            machina (Gorgias), he at length is persuaded to do.</p>
          <p>In chapter 62 he next proceeds to recapitulate in a sum- <lb/>
            mary way the results of the preceding argument; and the <lb/>
            first general conclusion is that <foreign xml:lang="grc">σωφροσύνη</foreign>, the principle of <lb/>
            order and of harmony, of due subordination and arrange- <lb/>
            ment in the human soul, which has been shown to be the <lb/>
            soul's highest good, rightly understood involves every virtue; <lb/>
            piety and justice, which consist in doing what is right, one's <lb/>
            duty, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ προσήκοντα</foreign>, to Gods and men1, and courage or for- <lb/>
            titude, which consists in seeking and avoiding the right <lb/>
            things and men, pleasures and pains, and enduring either <note type="footnote"> 1 The reasoning here depends upon the interpretation of the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">σώφρων, <lb/>
            σωφρονεῖν. σωφροσύνη</foreign> is here regarded as soundness of mind, in accordance <lb/>
            with its derivation, and soundness of mind' it is argued necessarily implies <lb/>
            the notion of doing what is proper and fitting to every one, men and Gods; and <lb/>
            therefore of doing one's duty to them, which is the meaning of piety and <lb/>
            justice. Schleiermacher accordingly renders <foreign xml:lang="grc">σώφρων</foreign> der Besonnene. The same <lb/>
            may be said of the following argument to show that it implies bravery as well <lb/>
            as justice and piety. And by this interpretation <foreign xml:lang="grc">σωφροσύνη</foreign> will also neces- <lb/>
            sarily imply <foreign xml:lang="grc">φρόνησις</foreign>, the fourth of the cardinal virtues, and so include all <lb/>
            the four. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="LX"/>
            pain or danger when a man is bound to do so. Consequently <lb/>
            one who has the virtue of temperance or self-control must <lb/>
            be in all respects a good man, and a good man will ‘do <lb/>
            well,' and one who docs weir will be happy: and the op- <lb/>
            posites of this, intemperance licentiousness self-indulgence, <lb/>
            must therefore be the soul's vice and lead to misery instead <lb/>
            of to happiness, as Callicles maintained, p. 507 c.</p>
          <p>Accordingly the general conclusions of cc. G2, 63, may be <lb/>
            thus summed up. In opposition to Callicles' position that <lb/>
            happiness consists in intemperance licentiousness self-indul- <lb/>
            gence, it has been shown (by induction) that order harmony <lb/>
            due subordination and arrangement are necessary to, or ra- <lb/>
            ther constitute, the well-being and perfection of everything <lb/>
            in art and nature; by these principles heaven and earth, the <lb/>
            Gods and human society, are held together, and from this <lb/>
            the whole universe receives its name (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κόσμος</foreign>). In man <lb/>
            these principles are called <foreign xml:lang="grc">κοσμιότης, σωφροσύνη</foreign>; and this <lb/>
            is that temperance or self-control which necessarily brings <lb/>
            with it the other virtues, and unites all our faculties, physi- <lb/>
            cal mental, and moral, in an orderly and harmonious co- <lb/>
            operation, tending to one end, the supreme good. Hence it <lb/>
            appears that orderliness and subordination, 'due measure' <lb/>
            proportion or ‘law,’ are necessary to the development and <lb/>
            maintenance of the integrity and perfection of the human <lb/>
            nature, as of all other things; and that licentiousness, which <lb/>
            introduces disorder and is accompanied by <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλεονεξία</foreign>, a grasp- <lb/>
            ing rapacious dissatisfied spirit, a desire for inequality, and a <lb/>
            principle of insubordination, and thereby thwarts and mars <lb/>
            this harmonious development, so far from being good and <lb/>
            contributing to happiness, is in fact the worst evil that can <lb/>
            befal a man; and that any remedy or correction however <lb/>
            painful must be resorted to by which we may be relieved of <lb/>
            it: and hence also those paradoxes, as they appeared when <lb/>
            first stated, are now shown to be really true, that to do <lb/>
            wrong is a greater calamity than to suffer it, that the only <lb/>
            use of rhetoric is to accuse, not to defend, oneself or one’s <lb/>
             <pb n="LXI"/>
            child or friend of any secret crime which would otherwise <lb/>
            pass undetected and unpunished; and so we now come round <lb/>
            again to the conclusion of the original argument with Gor- <lb/>
            gias, that the genuine rhetorician or true statesman must be <lb/>
            just himself and acquainted with the principles of justice <lb/>
            and of virtue. 508 c.</p>
          <p><foreign xml:lang="grc">Σωφροσύνη</foreign>, which stands in this dialogue for the prin- <lb/>
            ciple of order, the supreme regulative and controlling au- <lb/>
            thority in man's moral constitution, takes here the place <lb/>
            which is assigned to <foreign xml:lang="grc">δικαιοσύνη</foreign> in the psychological analysis <lb/>
            of the Republic. There Justice (that is, distributive Justice) <lb/>
            is the principle which orders and harmonises that constitu- <lb/>
            tion, introduces a right arrangement of the several parts, <lb/>
            keeps the desires and appetites and the lower elements in <lb/>
            general in due subordination to the higher, the reason or <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">νοῦς</foreign>, governs the whole and regulates the action of the en- <lb/>
            tire machine. Compare also, Rep. IX. 591 A—E, where this <lb/>
            effect is described as the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἁρμονία, ξυμφωνία</foreign>, of the soul, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ <lb/>
            ἐν αὑτῷ πολιτεία</foreign>; and the same views of man's nature in <lb/>
            its perfection, of the aim of life conduct and education, are <lb/>
            expressed in terms derived from the conclusions moral and <lb/>
            psychological previously established in the course of that <lb/>
            dialogue. Here again therefore the arguments of the Gor- <lb/>
            gias may be regarded as anticipatory of or introductory to <lb/>
            the more advanced and dogmatic statements of the Republic. <lb/>
            To use Dr Whewell's words, Platonic Dialogues, II. 222, " So <lb/>
            given, the discourse (Socrates' recapitulation) becomes a <lb/>
            statement of Plato's philosophy at this period; that is, at a <lb/>
            stage of his doctrines preceding that which the Republic <lb/>
            presents; namely, when he regarded the soul of man as a <lb/>
            constitution, but had not yet discerned clearly what were the <lb/>
            component elements of that constitution."</p>
          <p>The high value which Plato attached to this conception <lb/>
            of order harmony, proportion, law, and the important place <lb/>
            which it fills in the entire scheme of his philosophy, may be <lb/>
            further estimated by the prominent part assigned to it in <lb/>
             <pb n="LXII"/>
            the discussions of the Philebus. It first appears there as the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πέρας</foreign>, or <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ περαῖνον</foreign>, or <foreign xml:lang="grc">πεπρασμένον</foreign>. Borrowing the notion <lb/>
            from the Pythagoreans Plato commences that dialogue by lay- <lb/>
            ing down three original elements in the entire constitution <lb/>
            of things, together with a fourth, the first cause, which is <lb/>
            independent of the rest. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄπειρον</foreign>, or indefinite matter, <lb/>
            assumes a definite shape and a positive existence by the in- <lb/>
            troduction of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">πέρας</foreign>, the limit, the principle of the defi- <lb/>
            nite or determinate, or, in a wider sense, of order symmetry <lb/>
            harmony organization, which the Pythagoreans represented <lb/>
            under the form of numbers, but may be conceived more <lb/>
            definitely and expressed in one word as ‘law.’ The third <lb/>
            element is the mixture of these two; and besides these as a <lb/>
            fourth, there is the cause of the mixture, or independent first <lb/>
            cause. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄπειρον</foreign> per se is the principle of evil. In it is <lb/>
            included all that is susceptible of degree, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ μᾶλλον καὶ ἦττον</foreign>, <lb/>
            all excess and defect. This evil tendency is corrected by the <lb/>
            introduction of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">πέρας</foreign>, and from the blending of the two <lb/>
            proceeds all that is good. Thus in the human bodily con- <lb/>
            stitution, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄπειρον</foreign> is the principle of the excess or defect <lb/>
            in which consists disease: the <foreign xml:lang="grc">πέρας</foreign> corrects this, and the <lb/>
            union of the two produces health, the normal or perfect state <lb/>
            of the constitution of the body. In sounds, the indefinite <lb/>
            materials sharp and flat, quick and slow, which are naturally <lb/>
            and in themselves devoid of musical harmony, are harmo- <lb/>
            nized by the <foreign xml:lang="grc">πέρας</foreign> and become music. Similarly in hot <lb/>
            and cold, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">πέρας</foreign> brings with it the due temperature of the <lb/>
            seasons; and so on in other things. ADd in the classification <lb/>
            of the various forms of good which concludes the dialogue, <lb/>
            p. 65 c, the first place is assigned to <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ μέτριον καὶ τὸ καίριον</foreign>, <lb/>
            the general principle of harmony proportion and measure, or <lb/>
            in other words of 'law' and 'order,' in place and time. In <lb/>
            the Laws, IV. 716 c, God himself is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">μετριότης, μέτρον <lb/>
            πάντων χρημάτων</foreign>.</p>
          <p>It is hardly necessary to observe that from the principles <lb/>
            thus set forth in the Philebus Aristotle has derived two of <lb/>
             <pb n="LXIII"/>
            the most prominent and leading doctrines of his Metaphysical <lb/>
            and Ethical system. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄπειρον</foreign> appears amongst his four <lb/>
            causes as the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὕλη</foreign>, the material cause or element, the indefi- <lb/>
            nite shapeless matter of things, having only a potential ex- <lb/>
            istence, <foreign xml:lang="grc">δυνάμει</foreign>; the <foreign xml:lang="grc">πέρας</foreign> becomes the <foreign xml:lang="grc">λόγος</foreign>, or TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">τί ἦν <lb/>
            εἶναι</foreign>, which gives the formless matter a definite shape and <lb/>
            substantial existence, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνερείᾳ</foreign>, and makes it what it is, or <lb/>
            was to be; fulfils, that is, its idea, the end or <foreign xml:lang="grc">τέλος</foreign> of its <lb/>
            being. It is equally plain that the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄπειρον</foreign> with its excess <lb/>
            and defect, and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">πέρας</foreign>, which by limiting and defining <lb/>
            these converts them into good, furnished his Ethical philoso- <lb/>
            phy with the notion of the mean, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ μέσον</foreign>, in which virtue <lb/>
            resides, and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπερβολή</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔλλειψις</foreign> which constitute vice <lb/>
            and error.</p>
          <p>To return to the Gorgias. In c. 64 Socrates first replies <lb/>
            to the taunts which Callicles had thrown out against his <lb/>
            lifelong devotion to philosophy, which it now appears were <lb/>
            misdirected and baseless; and then proceeds to recapitulate his <lb/>
            previous assertions which have at length been established by <lb/>
            argument and become conclusions. And now Callicles is again <lb/>
            enticed back into the discussion: but his spirit is by this <lb/>
            time broken and his objections exhausted, and though still <lb/>
            secretly of the same mind as before he shows no further fight, <lb/>
            and does little more than express assent until the end of the <lb/>
            dialogue.</p>
          <p>The comparative value of a defence against doing and <lb/>
            suffering wrong is now therefore determined, since it has been <lb/>
            proved that doing wrong is undoubtedly the greater evil of <lb/>
            the two. A defence against this is to be found only in the <lb/>
            knowledge of right and wrong, what is just and what is unjust <lb/>
            (in the study, that is, of Ethical Philosophy), since no one does <lb/>
            wrong intentionally and with his eyes open, c. 65; protection <lb/>
            against suffering wrong, c. 66, can be secured only by making <lb/>
            oneself like the ruling powers; by setting oneself from one's <lb/>
            earliest youth to copy their manners, adopt their feelings and <lb/>
            opinions, and in short assimilate one's mind and character <lb/>
             <pb n="LXIV"/>
            in every point as nearly as possible to theirs: this is the only <lb/>
            way of ingratiating oneself with them and thereby ensuring <lb/>
            one's safety. Callicles here objects that this is a necessity; <lb/>
            one who sets himself in opposition to the powers that be will <lb/>
            be put to death; but this makes no difference to the question; <lb/>
            it still remains true that to conform oneself to a vicious pat- <lb/>
            tern and so become wicked is a greater evil than to suffer <lb/>
            any calamity: and again, cc. 67, 68, if rhetoric is of that <lb/>
            high value which Callicles attributes to it in virtue of its <lb/>
            being the art of self-preservation, the same must be true of a <lb/>
            number of other arts, swimming, navigation, fortification or <lb/>
            military engineering, which are equally necessary in many <lb/>
            cases to the preservation of a man's life and fortunes, and yet <lb/>
            none of them assumes the consequence or gives itself the <lb/>
            pretentious airs of self-importance which are exhibited by <lb/>
            the Rhetorician, or Politician as Callicles understands it. (In <lb/>
            the connection of the argument in the last paragraph I have <lb/>
            followed Bonitz, u. s. p. 258.)</p>
          <p>In proving the first point in the above argument Plato <lb/>
            has recourse to the axiom which is elsewhere expressed in <lb/>
            the phrase <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐδεὶς ἑκὼν κακός</foreign>: a principle which, Socrates <lb/>
            observes, has been already admitted in the course of the dis- <lb/>
            cussion with Polus. He refers to c. 24, p. 468 c. foil., where <lb/>
            it is argued that good is always a man's real object, or that <lb/>
            when a man does what he really wishes, he does what is <lb/>
            good. This principle, directly or indirectly stated, and what- <lb/>
            ever its exact meaning may be, is asserted through the entire <lb/>
            series of Plato's works from the Protagoras to the Laws, and <lb/>
            therefore must have been held by him in some sense or other <lb/>
            at all periods of his philosophical career. It occurs Protag. <lb/>
            358 c, it is implied and argued upon, Meno, 77 B—78 B, and, <lb/>
            to refer only to his later writings, is found in the Philebus, <lb/>
            22 B (indirectly stated), Rep. IX. 589 c, Timæus, 86 D, Laws, <lb/>
            v. 731 c, 734 B, IX. 860 D, where it is discussed at length. <lb/>
            Various meanings may be attached to the axiom. It may <lb/>
            signify, as in the Timæus, 86 D, that all vice arises from an <lb/>
             <pb n="LXV"/>
            imperfect faulty bodily organization, an evil nature, and <lb/>
            defects of education, public and private, which prevent men <lb/>
            from seeing and following what is good. <foreign xml:lang="grc">κακὸς μὲν γὰρ ἑκὼν <lb/>
            οὐδείς</foreign>• <foreign xml:lang="grc">διὰ δὲ πονηρὰν ἔξιν τινὰ τοῦ σώματος καὶ ἀπαίδετον <lb/>
            τροφὴν</foreign> o <foreign xml:lang="grc">κακὸς γίγνεται κακός</foreign>. These vices of bodily con- <lb/>
            stitution are explained to be the various bad humours which <lb/>
            produce all sorts of diseases in the soul, generating ill-temper <lb/>
            and peevishness and rashness and cowardice and forgetfulness <lb/>
            and stupidity. (Of course these must be understood as mere <lb/>
            hindrances, not as insurmountable obstacles to the attain- <lb/>
            ment of virtue and good, otherwise what is here said would <lb/>
            be absolutely irreconcileable with the passages quoted below <lb/>
            from the Republic, x. and Laws, x. in which the entire free- <lb/>
            dom of the will in the choice of our path in life, of virtue <lb/>
            and vice, is most explicitly affirmed.) And further, Tim. 87 A, <lb/>
            and besides all this...when the forms of government, and <lb/>
            the doctrines current, and the language held in public and in <lb/>
            private through our cities are all so bad, and the studies <lb/>
            pursued by the young are by no means calculated to correct <lb/>
            these influences, thus it is that from these two causes all <lb/>
            those of us that are bad are made so most involuntarily."</p>
          <p>Again it may be a deduction from the ethical theory that <lb/>
            virtue is nothing but knowledge: and in this sense it stands <lb/>
            doubtless in the Protagoras, which was written while Plato <lb/>
            was still under the immediate influence of the teaching of <lb/>
            Socrates, who as is well known from Xenophon Aristotle and <lb/>
            and other authorities held this view of the nature of virtue. <lb/>
            From this theory it follows at once as a necessary consequence <lb/>
            that vice being mere ignorance is unintentional; "for," as <lb/>
            Socrates himself says in Xenophon, Memor. III. 9, 4, "all <lb/>
            choose out of the possible courses of action those which they <lb/>
            think most advantageous to themselves, and neither can those <lb/>
            who are acquainted with virtue and justice choose anything <lb/>
            else in preference to them, nor can those who do not under- <lb/>
            stand them act in conformity with them." In this sense the <lb/>
            maxim is criticised and rejected by Aristotle; Eth. Nic. III. 7 <note type="footnote"> e </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="LXVI"/>
            (Bekk.), VI. 5 ult., Metaph. A. 29, 1025, a. 9, compare Magn. <lb/>
            Moral. T. l. 6. The criticism in one word amounts to this, <lb/>
            that In pronouncing vice to be involuntary Socrates over- <lb/>
            looked the freedom of the will; the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρχή</foreign> of all moral action <lb/>
            resides in ourselves; until the habit has become confirmed, and <lb/>
            then perhaps vice may be said in a sense to be unintentional. <lb/>
            Plato's opinion upon the subject, the connection of wisdom <lb/>
            or knowledge and virtue, gradually underwent a change as <lb/>
            his knowledge widened and his views became enlarged. In <lb/>
            the Gorgias 495 D, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνδρεία</foreign> is expressly distinguished from <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιστήμη</foreign>, (with which it is identified in the Protagoras, and <lb/>
            perhaps also the Laches,) and therefore from virtue in gene- <lb/>
            ral; and in Mono, 98 D, E, the identity of virtue and <foreign xml:lang="grc">φρόνησις</foreign> <lb/>
            is explicitly denied. Still he continued to maintain to the <lb/>
            end of his career the inseparable union of the two, that virtue <lb/>
            in the highest sense without philosophical insight was impos- <lb/>
            sible. See especially the passage of the Phædo 68 B—69 D <lb/>
            and the references given by Stallbaum in his valuable note on <lb/>
            p. 68 c, in which he distinguishes three kinds or degrees of <lb/>
            virtue recognised by Plato. The highest form of virtue <lb/>
            based upon and springing from philosophical knowledge, and <lb/>
            due in part to a happy organisation of body (compare the <lb/>
            curious passage of Timaeus, 86 D), and soul (Republic) is of <lb/>
            course beyond the reach of vulgar mortals and cannot be <lb/>
            imparted by precept or training alone (Meno) Rep. VII. 518 <lb/>
            B, c. However, the freedom of the will in the determination <lb/>
            of a man's conduct is most distinctly asserted in two remark- <lb/>
            able passages of his latest works. Rep. X. 617 E, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρετὴ δὲ</foreign> <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_57_fig6.jpg"/></figure></p>
          <p>As regards the communicability of virtue, el <foreign xml:lang="grc">διδακτὸν ἡ <lb/>
            ἀρετή</foreign>, Plato's expressions in his earlier dialogues, particularly <lb/>
             <pb n="LXVII"/>
            the Meno, arc very various and puzzling, and might seem <lb/>
            even to be contradictory. Writing late in life, he attributes <lb/>
            the greatest importance to education in the formation of cha- <lb/>
            racter. In the Timæus, p. 86 D, he says <foreign xml:lang="grc">διὰ πονηρὰν ἕξιν τινὰ</foreign> <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_57_fig7.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">δὲ ἑλεῖν</foreign>. Another important passage on the nature and <lb/>
              effect of education occurs in Legg. II. 653 A foll., which is <lb/>
              however too long to quote. He seems in this to be speaking <lb/>
              of virtue in its popular and ordinary sense, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ δημοτικὴ καὶ <lb/>
              πολιτικὴ ἀρετή</foreign> as he elsewhere calls it, not of the highest or <lb/>
              philosophical form of it.</p>
          <p>To reconcile the various and apparently conflicting ex- <lb/>
            pressions of Plato upon the subject of virtue and especially <lb/>
            upon the possibility of imparting it, is a task of great diffi- <lb/>
            culty, and I know not if I have anywhere seen it thoroughly <lb/>
            and satisfactorily executed in detail. The distinction of <lb/>
            philosophical and popular virtue which he recognised may go <lb/>
            some way towards helping us out of the embarrassment; <lb/>
            and perhaps the following account may in some degree <lb/>
            represent his ultimate views upon the conditions of virtue <lb/>
            and the possibility of teaching or imparting it. The Sophists <lb/>
            by their unlimited professions of teaching virtue seem first <lb/>
            to have raised the question whether it really could be <lb/>
            taught. This in their sense, that is that it could be sown like <lb/>
            a seed or planted like a tree and made to grow in any soil or <lb/>
            under any conditions, is disproved in the Mono; compare <lb/>
            Isocr. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀντίδ</foreign>. § 274 : and especially the impossibility of trans- <lb/>
            mitting virtue in the sense of skill and ability is shown by <lb/>
            the failure of all the famous statesmen of Athens to impart <lb/>
            it to their children, because we may fairly assume that they <lb/>
            would have done so if it had been possible. The perfection <lb/>
            of virtue requires first a happy natural organization even of <note type="footnote"> e 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="LXVIII"/>
            body, Tim. 86 D already quoted, and mind1 (Republic); and <lb/>
            favourable antecedents, as of the form of government and <lb/>
            state institutions, virtuous parents and capable instructors. <lb/>
            Tim. u. s. 86, 87. In its highest perfection it cannot exist <lb/>
            without a full knowledge of the realities of things, and there- <lb/>
            fore requires a thorough philosophical training and insight <lb/>
            into truth (Phædo and Republic). Philosophy and education <lb/>
            it is true cannot impart virtue when no favourable conditions <lb/>
            of temper and knowledge exist. All that they can do in any <lb/>
            case is to encourage and stimulate, guide and direct the soul <lb/>
            in the pursuit of virtue, by diverting it from fleeting trans- <lb/>
            itory phenomena and things of sense, together with the <lb/>
            pleasures and passions which cling to this lower world of <lb/>
            phenomena, and so by raising it to the contemplation of <lb/>
            truth and reality and revealing to it the excellence of virtue <lb/>
            and real good, to inspire it with a passion and a desire to <lb/>
            attain to it. See Republic VII. and especially the passage <lb/>
            already referred to 518 B, C, D, foll, which seems to furnish <lb/>
            the key to the solution of the riddle of the Mono, by con- <lb/>
            trasting the pretensions of education-<foreign xml:lang="grc">οἵαν τινὲς ἐπαγγελλό</foreign>- <figure type="illustration">

              bably of body too, is essential. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Compare Dr Whewell's excellent observations upon the philosophical <lb/>
              meaning and purpose of the Meno, Platonic Dialogues, 1. 255, 6. It is thus <lb/>
              briefly stated in the Introductory note upon the second title, p. 196: "the <lb/>
              conclusion, in which it is implied that the Virtue which does not involve <lb/>
              knowledge is not what the philosopher seeks." The same writer, p. 255, inti- <lb/>
              mates that the doctrines upon the connection of virtue and knowledge, which <lb/>
              the dialogue is really intended to convey, represent the opinions held by Plato <lb/>
              at this period, i. e. at the very early period of Plato's literary career, while he <lb/>
              was still under Socratic influences, to which Dr Whewell assigns it. But if <lb/>
              the opinions intended amount to nothing more than that true virtue must be <lb/>
              based on philosophical knowledge of the true and good and cannot exist with- </note> <pb n="LXIX"/>
              </p>
          <p>But, returning to the Gorgias, from which we have per- <lb/>
            haps strayed too far away, all that seems to be meant here, <lb/>
            and generally in the later dialogues, by saying that those who <lb/>
            do wrong do it unintentionally is that as good is the univer- <lb/>
            sal aim, and moral good the only real good, when once a man <lb/>
            has acquired a knowledge of the true nature and excellence <lb/>
            of virtue it will exercise an overpowering attraction upon his <lb/>
            conduct, and he will be irresistibly impelled to the pursuit <lb/>
            of it; as upon -the same principle it was argued in the con- <lb/>
            versation with Gorgias, p. 460 B, C, that those that have <lb/>
            learnt justice are just, and the just will always act justly; not <lb/>
            meaning that justice is nothing but knowledge and a kind of <lb/>
            skill to be acquired by teaching like any of the arts, nor <lb/>
            amounting like the Socratic doctrine to a total suppression <lb/>
            of the will, but implying merely that, as the will is in- <lb/>
            fluenced by motives, the good or virtue, which supplies an <lb/>
            overpowering motive, cannot fail to attract the enlightened <lb/>
            will and determine it to the pursuit of virtue.</p>
          <p>And now we are brought to the final judgment and con- <lb/>
            demnation of the views of life and the course of conduct set <lb/>
            forth by Callicles as those which alone lead to happiness, <lb/>
            cc. 69-78. As the starting point and basis for this last stage <lb/>
            of the argument, Socrates first reminds his opposite, now no <lb/>
            longer his active opponent, that of the two varieties of modes <lb/>
            of dealing with body and soul all those that aim exclusively at <lb/>
            pleasure are to be rejected, and consequently that the object <lb/>
            of the genuine statesman must be to promote the good, that <lb/>
            is, the moral improvement, of the citizens, compared with <note type="footnote"> out it, we need not thus limit the period at which the author held them to the <lb/>
            early part of his life: the terms in which Dr Whewell describes these opinions, <lb/>
            in the sentences beginning "over against this stands the opposite opinion, &amp;c.” <lb/>
            present a most curiously exact parallel (considering that it is to all appearance <lb/>
            accidental) to the passage from the Republic, Bk. VII. quoted in the text, which <lb/>
            he does not refer to: and there can be no doubt that this must represent the <lb/>
            views entertained upon the question by Plato in the fully developed matu- <lb/>
            rity of his philosophical creed. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="LXX"/>
            which every other service real or supposed that he can ren- <lb/>
            tier them, as the acquisition of wealth power dominion, is <lb/>
            absolutely worthless. There is accordingly an art of Politics <lb/>
            in which the would-be statesman ought to be thoroughly <lb/>
            versed and his skill tested before he enters upon any public <lb/>
            duties; just as the state physicians, shipwrights, architects, <lb/>
            and so forth, are obliged to give some proof of their qualifi- <lb/>
            cations before they are entrusted with any public functions; <lb/>
            and this is in fact moral science or ethical philosophy, <lb/>
            which teaches what are the true objects and rule of life, and <lb/>
            by what means this moral improvement may be attained. <lb/>
            cc. 69, 70. Tried by this standard the shortcomings of <lb/>
            the Athenian statesmen, even the most famous of the past <lb/>
            ages, are brought to light. Their claim to admiration and <lb/>
            respect as statesmen must be estimated by the moral pro- <lb/>
            gress made by the citizens whilst under their care: without <lb/>
            this all mere external embellishments, all accession of power <lb/>
            wealth and splendour provided by their administration, weigh <lb/>
            as nothing in the balance. But it is precisely in this point <lb/>
            that their deficiences are most manifest. Even Pericles the <lb/>
            most celebrated of them all is acknowledged to have left the <lb/>
            citizens more lazy and garrulous and effeminate and greedy <lb/>
            than he found them by the system of fees that he was the <lb/>
            first to introduce. But just as we should charge a herdsman <lb/>
            or horsebreaker with utter ignorance of his business if the <lb/>
            animals which he received free from vice had learnt under <lb/>
            his hands to butt or kick or bite, so by the same rule a <lb/>
            statesman who is charged with the care and training of men <lb/>
            must be pronounced incompetent if the animals that he has <lb/>
            to deal with become worse under his management. And <lb/>
            this is shown by the conduct of the citizens themselves to <lb/>
            these their supposed benefactors. Cimon they ostracised; <lb/>
            Themistocles they treated in the same way, and banished to <lb/>
            boot; Miltiades narrowly escaped being thrown into the Pit; <lb/>
            and Pericles was found guilty of embezzlement and nearly <lb/>
            condemned to death. But had they been really trained in <lb/>
             <pb n="LXXI"/>
            justice and virtue they never could have been guilty of such <lb/>
            flagrant ingratitude. cc. 71, 72. These men it is true were <lb/>
            most skilful and able ministers to the city's vanity and am- <lb/>
            bition, which they pampered by providing her with docks <lb/>
            fleets long walls and other such non-essentials, but they are <lb/>
            no more entitled for this to the credit of genuine statesman- <lb/>
            ship than the baker the tavern-keeper or the cook can pro- <lb/>
            perly claim to fulfil the office of the trainer and physician <lb/>
            in the development of the strength and comeliness and the <lb/>
            maintenance of health in the body, c. 73: although, as po- <lb/>
            pular approbation is no test of truth, the men who are the <lb/>
            real authors of disease in the body corporate will very likely <lb/>
            escape all censure from those whom they have corrupted, and <lb/>
            all the blame will be thrown upon the advisers who are <lb/>
            called in, like a physician in a fever, when the complaint <lb/>
            has reached its crisis. However in any case it is just as <lb/>
            absurd for a statesman to complain of the ingratitude of the <lb/>
            citizens by whom he has been ill treated as it is for a sophist <lb/>
            to accuse those whom he has proposed to educate in justice <lb/>
            and virtue of cheating him of the fee that he has earned: <lb/>
            for such ingratitude only shows that the work has not been <lb/>
            properly done. c. 74. In fact the teacher of virtue is the <lb/>
            only artist who can safely leave the remuneration of his <lb/>
            services to the gratitude of those whom he has instructed; <lb/>
            and this is why for this particular service, that namely which <lb/>
            the Sophists proposed to render1, for giving instruction in <lb/>
            public and private virtue, the previous demand of a pecuniary <lb/>
            compensation is condemned by public opinion, because in <lb/>
            this case if the service is really performed the reward is <lb/>
            certain, cc. 75, 76, to p. 520 E. <note type="footnote"> 1 Compare the well-known definition of these Professors and their profes- <lb/>

          <p>"The roan convinced against his will Is of his first opi- <lb/>
            nion still," says Hudibras: and it now appears that Callicles' <lb/>
            recent acquiescence has been a mere pretence; for upon being <lb/>
            asked by Socrates whether he still recommends the same <lb/>
            course of political conduct as before, he replies that he does. <lb/>
            c. 76.</p>
          <p>The two directions of public life and conduct are now <lb/>
            finally contrasted. Socrates now claims to be the only man <lb/>
            in Athens, or nearly so, past and present who has true no- <lb/>
            tions of what Politics are and what public duty means. Any <lb/>
            one however who like him really aims at the improvement <lb/>
            of his fellow-citizens must expect unpopularity, if not perse- <lb/>
            cution and death: he will be like a physician on his trial <lb/>
            before a jury of children to whom he has given much neces- <lb/>
            sary pain in the course of his medical practice; all his pleas <lb/>
            of having acted for their advantage in what he did will be <lb/>
            set at nought or misunderstood; he will be accused (as So- <lb/>
            crates actually was) of corrupting the young and slandering <lb/>
            the old, and his ultimate fate will not be doubtful. But <lb/>
            armed with the consciousness of his innocence he will fear <lb/>
            neither danger nor death: death is terrible to none but the <lb/>
            fool and the coward; the only real evil and the real object of <lb/>
            dread is injustice and wickedness, and to go with a soul laden <lb/>
            with crimes to the world below, cc. 77, 78.</p>
          <p>The dialogue concludes with a myth in which the con- <lb/>
            dition of the soul in the other world after its separation from <lb/>
            the body, together with the doctrine of a future judgment <lb/>
            and retribution, are represented in accordance with the cur- <lb/>
            rent popular and traditionary belief. Then the true nature <lb/>
            of justice and injustice will be finally and fully revealed; <lb/>
            then when the soul is stript bare of all the adventitious ac- <lb/>
            complishments and worldly advantages, rank wealth splen- <lb/>
            dour talents personal beauty, by which men's eyes are daz- <lb/>

            naked face to face before her Judge and all her corruption <lb/>
            and depravity is brought to light, then it will be the turn <lb/>
             <pb n="LXXIII"/>
            of Callicles and those who with him have preferred wrong <lb/>
            and injustice in this life to stand amazed and abashed, 'dizzy <lb/>
            and open-mouthed,' in the presence of their Judge-like So- <lb/>
            crates the philosopher before a human tribunal-and then <lb/>
            they may chance to meet with the same insults that Socrates <lb/>
            was threatened with by Callicles if he neglected the cultiva- <lb/>
            tion of rhetoric as an instrument of self-defence, whilst the <lb/>
            philosopher who has minded his own business and not med- <lb/>
            dled with other people's affairs" will be approved by the <lb/>
            Judge and sent to dwell in the Isles of the Blest.</p>
          <p>And so with a brief summary of the conclusions to which <lb/>
            the argument has led them, and renewed exhortations to <lb/>
            Callicles to abandon those views of life which have now been <lb/>
            'shown to be false and delusive, and to follow the path of <lb/>
            duty which alone leads to true and abiding happiness, with <lb/>
            a genuine Platonic simplicity which reminds us of the cele- <lb/>
            brated opening of the Republic, the conversation is brought <lb/>
            to a close.</p>
          <p>The myth of which the general moral purpose has been <lb/>
            thus briefly expressed is one of four, or five if we include the <lb/>
            Cosmogony of the Timæus, that occur in Plato's writings upon <lb/>
            a similar subject, the condition of the souls of men in another <lb/>
            state of being1. The immortality of the soul, which is neces- <lb/>
            sarily involved in the doctrine of a retribution after death, <lb/>
            is here assumed, not proved. These conceptions are invested <lb/>
            with this fabulous character doubtless as conveying doctrines <lb/>
            which agree indeed with the conclusions of a sound philoso- <lb/>

            all times and in all places, but cannot be made to rest on a <lb/>

            fanciful half-poetical shape, and to fall in with the traditions <note type="footnote"> 1 The myth of the Timæus should perhaps hardly be included amongst <lb/>

            of the mytliologist and the fictions of the poet. The notions <lb/>
            that they embody of a future state of retribution, happiness <lb/>
            and misery, however they may have been acquired—whether <lb/>
            derived from primeval tradition, or inherent in the human <lb/>
            heart and conscience—were at all events current in Greece <lb/>
            from the earliest period of which the records remain to us; <lb/>
            they appear in the most ancient of her literary monuments, <lb/>
            the Homeric poems.</p>
          <p>The representation of the soul's future state assumes in <lb/>
            accordance with the general scope and intention of the <lb/>
            dialogue the most purely moral aspect in the myth of the <lb/>
            Gorgias, and there is here little that is original in the <lb/>
            scenery and concomitant circumstances of the judgment in the <lb/>
            world below, these being derived with only slight alteration <lb/>
            from the traditions of the Poets and Mythologists: it is <lb/>
            mixed up with no cosmical speculations as in the Phædo and <lb/>
            Republic, no physical theories or scientific calculations de- <lb/>
            rived from Geometry Harmonics and Astronomy as in the <lb/>
            Timæus, no metaphysical and psychological allegorizing as in <lb/>
            the Phædrus, no Pythagorean or Orphic1 metempsychosis as <lb/>
            in the Phædrus Phædo and Republic. From these two <lb/>
            points of difference an argument might be derived-if any <lb/>
            such were necessary-for assigning an earlier period to the <lb/>
            composition of the Gorgias than to the other four: but the <lb/>
            whole dialogue is animated by a youthful spirit of fun, here <lb/>
            and there, one might almost say, of levity; and not only <lb/>
            the tone, but the matter and the mode in which it is dealt <lb/>
            with, and the state of knowledge and progress in the develop- <lb/>
            ment of the author's system which it presents-for example <lb/>
            there is no hint of the Ideal Theory-all seem to imply that <lb/>
            the writer was a comparatively young man, and to agree per- <lb/>
            fectly well with the date which has been determined by other <lb/>
            considerations (see above p. lvi. note), the period, that is, in- <lb/>
            tervening between Plato's return from his first travels in <lb/>
            395 B. c. and his first journey to Sicily in 389 B. C. <note type="footnote"> 1 See Renouvier, Manuel de Phil. Anc. I. p. 68, Bk. II. § i. </note> <pb n="LXXV"/>
            </p>
          <p>As to the degree of faith which Plato himself reposed <lb/>
            in these representations of a future state, whether they are <lb/>
            to be regarded as speculations, or traditions, or the natural <lb/>
            and universal but indemonstrable convictions of the human <lb/>
            conscience, his own somewhat contradictory expressions hardly <lb/>
            enable us to pronounce with certainty. In the Gorgias, <lb/>
            523 A, he speaks of the story that he is going to tell as <lb/>
            ‘a true tale,' though Callicles will probably regard it as a <lb/>
            mere myth, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὧς ἀληθη̂ γὰρ ὄντα σοι λέξω</foreign> a <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέλλω λέγειν</foreign>. <lb/>
            At the conclusion of it he expresses himself with less cer- <lb/>
            tainty, 527 A. "All this very likely seems to you to be a <lb/>
            mere fable, like an old wife's tale, and you look with con- <lb/>
            tempt upon it. And there would be no wonder in your doing <lb/>
            so, if by any research we could find anything truer and <lb/>
            better." And in the Phædo, 114 D foil., he says that no man <lb/>
            of sense would maintain the exact truth of the description of <lb/>
            the other world that he has been giving; still he thinks that <lb/>
            such a state of things is in conformity with reason and what <lb/>
            ought to be, and the probability of such reward of virtue and <lb/>
            punishment of vice is sufficient for a man to stake his hopes <lb/>
            of the future upon. And much the same kind of conviction of <lb/>
            the general, though not particular, truth of such representa- <lb/>
            tions, as sufficient to determine a man's conduct in life, is <lb/>
            expressed at the beginning and end of the myth of the Re- <lb/>
            public, 614 A and 621 c. From a comparison of these passages <lb/>
            it seems that an inference may be drawn as to Plato's views <lb/>
            upon the subject such as I have already intimated: that <lb/>
            these doctrines harmonising as they do with the conclusions <lb/>
            of philosophy as to the immortality of the soul, the aim <lb/>
            and end of life, and the true nature of virtue and vice, and <lb/>
            likewise with the universal popular belief upon the subject- <lb/>
            see upon this a striking passage, Rep. 1. 330 D, and compare <lb/>
            Epist. VII. 335 A-may in some form or other be accepted as <lb/>
            sufficiently certain to supply a solid ground of action: against <lb/>
            the supposition that the particular mode of representation <lb/>
            adopted is meant for the literal reality, the mythical form <lb/>
             <pb n="LXXVI"/>
            in which they arc clothed, and the statements already quoted, <lb/>
            Phæd. 114 D, Gorg. 523 A, seem expressly intended to guard. <lb/>
            See the observations of Zeller on this subject, Phil. der <lb/>

          <p>OF the DRAMATIS PERSONS,</p>
          <p>GORGIAS is a pompous and dignified but courteous old <lb/>
            gentleman of about 75 or 80—as to the exact date of his <lb/>
            birth the authorities vary; Clinton, Fast. Hell., sub annis 427 <lb/>
            and 459, inclines to the year 485 B.C.; Foss, De Gorgia Leon- <lb/>
            tino, and others place it five years later-with a great deal of <lb/>
            simple and harmless vanity, fully alive to the splendour of his <lb/>
            own reputation and the extent of his acquirements, of which <lb/>
            he reminds us ever and anon in the course of conversation, but <lb/>
            at the same time with a most gracious condescension for the <lb/>
            ignorance and infirmities of his inferiors-that is, of all the <lb/>
            rest of the world. He is treated with great respect by <lb/>
            Socrates in consideration of his venerable age and distinc- <lb/>
            tion, and after a short conversation, in which he defends his <lb/>
            art by the ordinary arguments and finally contradicts him- <lb/>
            self, is allowed to sink into a dignified repose, from which he <lb/>
            only emerges for an instant whenever a dignus vindice nodus <lb/>
            calls for the interposition of such a godlike personage. On <lb/>
            the hypothesis which fixes the scenic date of the dialogue in <lb/>
            the year 405 B.C. he is now staying at Athens on a second <lb/>
            visit.</p>
          <p>POLUS is his disciple and famulus, young hot and impetu- <lb/>
            ous, <foreign xml:lang="grc">νέος καὶ ὀξύς</foreign>, forward and conceited to the very verge <lb/>
            of presumption—extremely like Thrasymachus in the Re- <lb/>
            public, whose general views of life and conduct coincide <lb/>
            pretty nearly with his own-and quite unable to understand <lb/>
            a distinction or see a difficulty. He has caught all the graces <lb/>
            and affectations of his masters new prose style, and has all <lb/>
            Gorgias' ostentation without his courtesy and moderation in <lb/>
            expressing himself. And so he plays his part1. <note type="footnote"> 1 Of Polus' intellectual character and opinions something more has been <lb/>
            said in the Introduction, pp. XXXVI. and xl. foll. </note> <pb n="LXXVIII"/>
            </p>
          <p>CHÆREPHON is the familiar and constant attendant of <lb/>
            Socrates, whose pale face and slovenly exterior are so well <lb/>
            known to it,-, from Aristophanes' Clouds, where his manners <lb/>
            habits and pursuits are caricatured for the amusement <lb/>
            of the Athenian play-goers. His part in this dialogue is <lb/>
            confined to a very few short sentences. In the Charmides, <lb/>
            the only other of Plato's dialogues in which he is introduced, <lb/>
            he is treated in the same way, and is little more than a <foreign xml:lang="grc">κωΦὸν <lb/>
            πρόσωπον</foreign>. All that we learn of him from that work is <lb/>
            that he was of an eager and enthusiastic temper, which pro- <lb/>
            cures for him the epithet of <foreign xml:lang="grc">μανικός</foreign>.</p>
          <p>The character of CALLICLES is much more fully exhibited <lb/>
            to us, and is therefore of a more composite order than any of <lb/>
            the preceding. He is a man of good family and position in <lb/>
            Athenian society, which entitles him to look down with a <lb/>
            very lofty scorn upon all professional people and mechanical <lb/>
            occupations; see p. 512 c. He seems to be a young man <lb/>
            from the half patronising politeness and affectionately de- <lb/>
            risive tone with which Socrates occasionally addresses him. <lb/>
            His temper is ambitious; he regards honour and distinction <lb/>
            and power as the highest good; thinks that a man's own <lb/>
            advancement is the true object of life, and that this is to <lb/>
            be sought at his country's expense by ingratiating himself <lb/>
            with the governing mob and thus obtaining office and au- <lb/>
            thority. As a means of attaining this end he vaunts the <lb/>
            new art of Rhetoric, the artificer of persuasion, as the -only <lb/>
            study worthy of a man of sense; philosophy, the rival pursuit <lb/>
            recommended by Socrates, he deems only fit for a child, as <lb/>
            a training and preparation for the more serious business of <lb/>
            public life. He is much clearer-headed and sharper-witted <lb/>
            than the juvenile and half-educated Polus, though eventually <lb/>
            he has to succumb to the irresistible cogency of the Socratic <lb/>
            dialectics. He dislikes contradiction and defeat, and is apt <lb/>
            to turn sulky and stubborn, as well as to have recourse to <lb/>
            underhand subterfuges, (so Bonitz, op. cit. p. '267) when <lb/>
            shown to be in the wrong, and always displays a good deal <lb/>
             <pb n="LXXIX"/>
            of petulance and a bold freedom sometimes almost amounting <lb/>
            to effrontery. Finally he has imbibed either from his master <lb/>
            Gorgias, or rather perhaps (for we have no evidence for the <lb/>
            former supposition) from the Athenian freethinkers of the <lb/>
            day 1-see Rep. II. 358 E. foil., where the exposition of these <lb/>
            doctrines is prefaced with a <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φασί</foreign>-the ethical theory that <lb/>
            might is the only right, that a man's own interest and ad- <lb/>
            vantage is the only true end and rule of life, to which he <lb/>
            gives expression in its most undisguised and offensive form <lb/>
            and in the most uncompromising terms.</p>
          <p>Lastly, SOCRATES is the Platonic Socrates; perhaps <lb/>
            the completest and most highly finished portrait in the <lb/>
            entire range of dramatic literature of one of the most extra- <lb/>
            ordinary men, hero, saint (saint after the fashion of the fifth <lb/>
            century before Christ), philosopher, that ever dignified human <lb/>
            nature and puzzled his contemporaries; and no where more <lb/>
            graphically and skilfully represented than in this dialogue <lb/>
            with all his odd peculiarities, his humour, his never-failing <lb/>
            good-temper, his mock humility, his pretence of ignorance, his <lb/>
            scrupulous politeness and affected deference for those whom <lb/>
            he is all the while turning into ridicule, his 'irony' in a <lb/>
            word-a term which as Aristotle hints took its special sense <lb/>
            from these very peculiarities in Socrates' ordinary manner- <lb/>
            lastly with his real heroism, his unyielding firmness and <lb/>
            strength of resolution, and above all that gigantic intellectual <lb/>
            power which enabled him as Xenophon says, (Memor. I. 2. <lb/>
            14) "to do just what he pleased with any body in argument."</p>
          <p>This is not the place to enter into any details about the <lb/>
            person manners and character of Socrates, which have been <lb/>
            so often and so ably described by others, by none more ably <note type="footnote"> 1 The word <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φασί</foreign> in the Republic is perfectly indefinite and we are not told <lb/>
            whether it was any particular class of persons that held and propagated these <lb/>
            doctrines; but all the evidence we have upon the subject induces me to believe <lb/>
            that they were originated by one of the Sophists, the Freethinkers of the day <lb/>
            in religion and morals, Protagoras or Thrasymachus or others, one of whom <lb/>
            actually states the theory as I have endeavoured to show, whilst it agrees per- <lb/>

            than by Mr Grote, Hist. of Greece, Vol. VIII. 68, and I will there- <lb/>
            fore only add one single observation; what must be thought <lb/>
            of the genius of the writer who could place such a character <lb/>
            in all its strength so fully and vividly before us that the <lb/>
            Socrates of two thousand years ago is to us as one whom we <lb/>
            have seen and heard and conversed with? who has presented <lb/>
            the scenes in which he always plays the principal part with <lb/>
            such perfect liveliness and fidelity that we seem ourselves to <lb/>
            be looking on and listening to the argument as it turns and <lb/>
            winds through its devious course, and find it hard to believe <lb/>
            that such a drama as the Phædo, or the Symposium, or the <lb/>
            Phædrus, or the Gorgias, is after all nothing but a fiction, and <lb/>

          <p>Socrates. What? are we come at the tail of a feast, as <lb/>
            the saying is, and too late?</p>
          <p>Gal. Yes indeed, and a very dainty feast it was. For <lb/>
            Gorgias has just been treating us to a fine long declamation.</p>
          <p>Soc. Aye but for that, Callicles, my friend Chærephon <lb/>
            here is to blame, because he forced me to stay loitering in <lb/>
            the market-place.</p>
          <p>Chærephon. No matter, Socrates: as I was the cause <lb/>
            so I'll find the cure. For Gorgias is a friend of mine, and <lb/>
            therefore he'll declaim for us, if you like at once, or if you <lb/>
            prefer it by and by.</p>
          <p>Gal. How's that, Chaerephon? Is Socrates anxious to <lb/>
            hear Gorgias?</p>
          <p>Cheer. To be sure, that's precisely the object of our being <lb/>
            here.</p>
          <p>Cal. Well then if you please to come home to my <lb/>
            house- For Gorgias is staying with me, and he'll favour you <lb/>
            with one of his addresses.</p>
          <p>Soc. Thank you, Callicles. But do you think he wouldn't <lb/>

            is that he professes to teach. The rest of his address he <lb/>
            may deliver, as you say, at some future time.</p>
          <p>Cal. There's nothing like asking him, Socrates. That <lb/>
            in fact was one of the points in the address that he gave us. <lb/>
            At all events he invited just now every one of the present <lb/>
            company1 to ask him any question he pleased, and he said <lb/>
            lie was ready to answer them all.</p>
          <p>Soc.. I am so glad to hear it. Ask him, Chærephon.</p>

          <p>Soc. Who he is.</p>
          <p>Cheer. What do you mean?</p>
          <p>Soc. Why suppose he had been a maker of shoes, he <lb/>
            would have answered, I presume, that he is a shoe-maker. <lb/>
            You understand what I mean, don't you?</p>
          <p><note type="margin"> c. 2. </note> Chær. I understand, and will ask him the question. ' Tell <lb/>

          <p><note type="chapter"> 448 </note> Gorgias. Quite true, Chærephon; in fact, that was the <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῶν ἔνδον ὄντων</foreign> show that they are supposed by this time to have reached the <lb/>
            house, where the rest of the dialogue is carried on. </note> <pb n="3"/>
            </p>
          <p>Pol. And pray what does that matter, if I do it well <lb/>
            enough for you?</p>
          <p>Cheer. Not at all. Well then, since such is your wish, <lb/>
            answer me.</p>
          <p>Pol. Ask away.</p>
          <p>Chœr. I will. If Gorgias had been master of the same <lb/>
            art as his brother Herodicus, what name would it have been <lb/>
            proper to give him? Would it not have been the same as <lb/>
            the other?</p>
          <p>Pol. No doubt it would.</p>
          <p>Chœr. Then in calling him a physician we should have <lb/>
            given him his right name.</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes.</p>
          <p>Chœr. And if he had been skilled in the art of Aristophon <lb/>
            son of Aglaophon, or his brother (Polygnotus), what would <lb/>
            it have been proper to call him?</p>
          <p>Pol. Plainly a painter.</p>
          <p>Cheer. And as it is, what is the art in which his skill <lb/>
            lies? and what would be the proper name to give him in <lb/>
            consequence?</p>
          <p>Pol. Chserephon, there are many arts amongst mankind <lb/>
            from experiences experimentally invented: for it is experi- <lb/>
            ence that makes our days proceed by rule of art, the want <lb/>
            of it by chance: and in each of these men participate various <lb/>
            in various variously, the best of them in the best: of whom <lb/>
            in fact Gorgias here is one, and so is a member of the noblest <lb/>
            of all professions1. <note type="footnote"> 1 This is no caricature, as Dr whewell (Platonic Dialogues, II. 171), who <lb/>
            adopts Mr Grote's views about Plato's relation to the early Sophists and their <lb/>
            followers, insinuates: it is a literal quotation from Polus' Art of Rhetoric. <lb/>
            The first clause is quoted by Syrianus, Schol. ad Hermog. ap. Spengel, Art. <lb/>
            Script, p. 87; and the second by Aristotle, Metaph. A. I. It appears probable <lb/>
            from the former passage that these were the words with which the work com- <lb/>
            menced. It is character'sed by the symmetrical and highly artificial structure <lb/>
            which Gorgias introduced into his prose compositions, and even reproduces <lb/>
            another of his peculiarities in the use of the poetical word <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἰῶνα</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="grc">βίον</foreign>. It <lb/>
            displays besides a rhetorical figure, of which Polus seems to have been him-</note> <note type="footnote"> 1-2 </note> <pb n="4"/>

          <p><note type="margin"> c. 3. </note> \ <lb/>
             <lb/>
            Soc. Rarely indeed to all appearance, Gorgias, is Polus <lb/>
            provided for making speeches; still however he is not fulfil- <lb/>
            ling his promise to Chærephon.</p>
          <p>Go?-. What in particular, Socrates ?</p>
          <p>Soc. He doesn't seem to me exactly to answer the <lb/>
            question put to him.</p>
          <p>Gor. Well then, if you please, do you ask him.</p>
          <p>Soc. Not if you wouldn't mind answering yourself, but <lb/>
            I should much prefer asking you. For it is plain to me <lb/>
            even from what Polus has already said, that he has studied <lb/>
            rather what is called the art of rhetoric, than that of (dia- <lb/>
            lectical) conversation.</p>
          <p>Pol. How so, Socrates ?</p>
          <p>Soc. Because, Polus, when Chaerephon asks you what <lb/>
            art Gorgias is master of, you pronounce an eulogium upon <lb/>
            his art, just as if any one found fault with it; without an- <lb/>
            swering what it is.</p>
          <p>Pol. Why, didn't I answer that it was the noblest <lb/>
            of all ?</p>
          <p>Soc. Yes indeed you did. But no one asked you what <lb/>
            sort of art Gorgias' was, but what, and by what name Gor- <note type="chapter"> 449 </note> <lb/>
            gias ought to be called; just as Chærephon traced out the <lb/>
            line for you before, and you answered him fairly and in <lb/>
            few words, so now in the same way tell us what the art is, <lb/>
            and what we are to call Gorgias. Or rather, Gorgias, do you <lb/>
            tell us yourself what is the art you are master of, and what <lb/>
            we are to call you in consequence.</p>
          <p>Gor. The art of rhetoric, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Soc. Are we then to call you a rhetorician ?</p>
          <p>Gar. Aye a good one, Socrates, if you please to call <lb/>
            me what ' I boast myself to be,' as Homer says.</p>
          <p>Soc. Well, I will with pleasure.</p>
          <p>Gor. Then pray do. <note type="footnote"> self the inventor: for the reduplication of the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐμπειριῶν ἐμπείρως</foreign>, and <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Soc. So then are we to say that you have the power <lb/>
            of making others besides yourself the same ?</p>
          <p>Go?-. Yes, I certainly make this profession, not only <lb/>
            here but elsewhere as well.</p>
          <p>Soc. Would you then be good enough, Gorgias, to finish <lb/>
            the conversation in the way in which we are now talking <lb/>
            together, in alternate question and answer, and lay aside <lb/>
            that lengthy style, in which Polus just began, for a future <lb/>
            occasion ? Come now, keep your promise, and don't disap- <lb/>
            point me; but consent to answer briefly the questions put to <lb/>
            you.</p>
          <p>Gor. There are some answers, Socrates, which are obliged <lb/>
            to express themselves at great length : not but that I will do <lb/>
            my best to make them as short as possible. For in fact <lb/>
            this again is one of the things that I lay claim to, that no <lb/>
            one could ever express the same meaning in fewer words <lb/>
            than myself.</p>
          <p>Soc. That's exactly what we want, Gorgias. This is <lb/>
            precisely what I should like you to give us a specimen of, <lb/>
            your short style; your lengthy one you can reserve for some <lb/>
            future time.</p>
          <p>Gor. Well, I will do so; and you shall say that you never <lb/>
            heard any one use fewer words.</p>
          <p>Soc. Come then. Since you say that you are master <note type="margin"> c. 4. </note> <lb/>
            of the art of rhetoric, and can make any one else an orator <lb/>
            —what of all things is it that rhetoric deals with ? as weav- <lb/>
            ing for instance is employed upon the production of clothes; <lb/>
            isn't it ?</p>
          <p>Gor. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. And music, again, upon the composition of tunes ?</p>
          <p>Gor. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. Faith, Gorgias, I do admire your replies. You are <lb/>
            indeed answering in the very fewest possible words.</p>
          <p>Gor. (Complacently.) Yes, and I think I do it very <lb/>
            tolerably well, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Soc. You are perfectly right. Come, then, answer me <lb/>
             <pb n="6"/>
            in the same way about rhetoric again; what are the things <lb/>
            to which its knowledge is applied?</p>
          <p>Gor. To words.</p>
          <p>Soc. To what sort of words, Gorgias ? Do you mean those <lb/>
            that point out by what course of treatment the sick may <lb/>
            recover their health ?</p>
          <p>Gor. No.</p>
          <p>Soc. Then rhetoric does not deal with all words.</p>
          <p>Gor. Certainly not.</p>
          <p>Soc. But still it makes men able to speak.</p>
          <p>Go?-. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. And to understand what they talk about as well ?</p>
          <p><note type="chapter"> 450 </note> Gor. Of course it does.</p>
          <p>Soc. Well, but doesn't the art we were just now speak- <lb/>
            ing of, medicine I mean, make men able to understand as <lb/>
            well as to speak about the sick ?</p>
          <p>Gor. Necessarily.</p>
          <p>Soc. Then medicine too, it seems, deals with words ?</p>
          <p>Gor. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. Those which are about diseases ?</p>
          <p>Gor. Precisely.</p>
          <p>Soc. Well and doesn't the gymnastic art too deal with <lb/>
            words, those namely which relate to the good and bad con- <lb/>
            dition of bodies ?</p>
          <p>Gor. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Soc. And moreover the case is the same, Gorgias, with <lb/>
            all other arts besides: each of them deals with words- <lb/>
            those, that is, that belong to the thing which is the object of <lb/>
            each particular art.</p>
          <p>Gor. So it appears.</p>
          <p>Soc. Then why in the world don't you call all the rest <lb/>
            of the arts rhetorical, when they are about 'words,' if you <lb/>
            give the name of rhetoric to every one which deals with <lb/>
            words ?</p>
          <p>Gor. Because, Socrates, in all the other arts the know- <lb/>
            ledge is, so to speak, entirely confined to manual operations <lb/>
             <pb n="7"/>
            and such like actions, whereas in rhetoric there is no such <lb/>
            manual process involved; but of all that it does and all <lb/>
            that it effects words are the vehicle. That is why I claim <lb/>
            on behalf of rhetoric that it is the art that deals with words; <lb/>
            and I maintain that I am right.</p>
          <p>Soc. I wonder whether I quite understand what sort <note type="margin"> c. 5. </note> <lb/>
            of art you mean to call it? (Never mind.) I shall know <lb/>
            better by and by. Pray now answer me. We have such <lb/>
            things as arts, haven't we ?</p>
          <p>Go?-. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. But of all these arts, some I believe have produc- <lb/>
            tion for their chief object, and require few words-some in- <lb/>
            deed none at all; in fact, the objects of the art might be <lb/>
            carried out even in silence; such as painting and sculpture <lb/>
            and many others. That is the kind which you seem to <lb/>
            have in view, when you say that rhetoric has no connection <lb/>
            with them. Isn't it ?</p>
          <p>Gor. You take my meaning perfectly, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Soc. But other arts there are which perform all their <lb/>
            operations by means of words, and as to acts, require either <lb/>
            none at all, as one may say, in addition, or only in a very <lb/>
            trifling degree; such as numeration for example, and reckon- <lb/>
            ing, and land-measuring, and draughts, and a number of other <lb/>
            arts, some of which have their ' words' pretty nearly equal <lb/>
            in amount to their actions, most of them indeed more <lb/>
            numerous; or even altogether their processes are carried on <lb/>
            and their effects produced entirely by means of words. It <lb/>
            is to this class, I believe, that you understand rhetoric to <lb/>
            belong.</p>
          <p>Gor. Quite true.</p>
          <p>Soc. But I don't at all suppose that you mean to call <lb/>
            any one of these rhetoric, although this 'vas implied by the <lb/>
            expression you used, in saying that the art whose effects are <lb/>
            produced by words is rhetoric; and one might suppose if one <lb/>
            chose to be captious in arguing, so then you mean arith- <lb/>
            metic by rhetoric, do you, Gorgias? But I don't believe you <lb/>
             <pb n="8"/>
            do mean either arithmetic or geometry when you speak of <lb/>
            rhetoric.</p>
          <p><note type="chapter"> 451 </note> Gor. And quite right too, Socrates; your supposition is <lb/>
            perfectly just.</p>
          <p><note type="margin"> c. 6 </note> Soc. Then let us begin at once, and do you do your part <lb/>
            in dispatching the answer to my question. For as rhetoric <lb/>
            is found to be one of those arts which chiefly employ words, <lb/>
            and there are others also of the same kind, try to explain <lb/>
            to me what it is in words upon which rhetoric operates in <lb/>
            producing its effects; suppose, for instance, any one were <lb/>
            to ask me about any one you please of the arts I just now <lb/>
            mentioned-what is the art of numeration, Socrates? I should <lb/>
            tell him, as you said just now, that it is one of those that <lb/>
            produce their effects by words. And if he were further to <lb/>
            inquire, what are those about? I should say that it is one <lb/>
            of those which are about (have for their object) the even <lb/>
            and odd, the whole series of each of them, whatever the num- <lb/>
            ber may amount to. And if again he were to ask, And <lb/>
            reckoning, what art do you call that? I should reply that <lb/>
            this likewise is one of those that effects all its operations by <lb/>
            words. And if he were to ask still further, what is its ob- <lb/>
            ject? I should say, in the language of the framers of bills <lb/>
            drawn for the assembly, 'in all else' the art of reckoning <lb/>
            is 'like the foregoing1 ;' for its object is the same, the even <lb/>
            and the odd; but there is just this amount of difference be- <lb/>
            tween them, that the art of reckoning or arithmetic takes <lb/>
            into consideration the relative as well as the absolute pro- <lb/>
            perties and relations of the even and the odd in point of <lb/>
            number. And if the same question were repeated about <note type="footnote"> 1 This refers to the formula employed when a <foreign xml:lang="grc">προβὑλευμα</foreign> of the Council <lb/>
            was altered and modified in the general assembly. It was open to any citizen <lb/>
            when a measure was sent down by the former body to the latter for its rati- <lb/>
            fication, either to oppose it by a counter-proposition, or, accepting some of its <lb/>
            provisions, to add others of his own, or to cancel or alter such as he dis- <lb/>
            approved. In the latter case, to avoid repetition, the proposed <foreign xml:lang="grc">ψήΦισμα</foreign> usually <lb/>
            commenced with the words T'a <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὲν ἄλλα καθάπερ τῃ̂ βουλῃ̂ ἔδοξε</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="9"/>
            astronomy, and upon my replying, that this again effects all <lb/>
            its processes by words, the questioner were to say, And what <lb/>
            are the ' words' (calculations, the science) of astronomy about, <lb/>
            Socrates? I should tell him that they are about the motion <lb/>
            of the stars and the sun and moon, that is to say, their <lb/>
            relative velocities.</p>
          <p>Gor. And you would be quite right, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Soc. Come then, in your turn, Gorgias. It so happens, <lb/>
            you see, that rhetoric is one of those arts that effect and <lb/>
            give force to all their operations by words. Isn't it?</p>
          <p>Go?-. It is so.</p>
          <p>Soc. Then tell me what they deal with. What of all <lb/>
            things in the world is that which is the object of the words <lb/>
            which rhetoric employs ?</p>
          <p>GOT. The most important of all human things, Socrates, <lb/>
            and the best.</p>
          <p>Soc. Nay, Gorgias, here again what you say is open to <note type="margin"> c. 7. </note> <lb/>
            question, and by no means clear as yet. For 1 think you <lb/>
            must have heard at parties after dinner people singing this <lb/>
            catch, in which in the words of the song the good things of <lb/>
            this life are enumerated, how that health is best of all, the <lb/>
            second best thing is to be born handsome, and the third, as <lb/>
            the author of the catch says, to be rich without fraud.</p>
          <p>Gor. To be sure I have; but what is your object in <lb/>
            mentioning this?</p>
          <p>Soc. Because those whose business lies in all those things <note type="chapter"> 452 </note> <lb/>
            that the composer of the catch spoke so highly of would <lb/>
            straightway present themselves, physician and training-master <lb/>
            and tradesman; and first of all the physician would say, <lb/>
            My dear Socrates, Gorgias is deceiving you: for it is not his <lb/>
            art that is employed upon mankind's greatest good, but mine. <lb/>
            If then I were to ask him, And who are you that say this? <lb/>
            he would reply probably, A physician. What say you then? <lb/>
            Is it your art that has the greatest good for its object? How <lb/>
            can health, Socrates, he would say very likely, be anything <lb/>
            else? What greater blessing can men have than health? <lb/>
             <pb n="10"/>
            And if again after him the trainer were to say, I should be <lb/>
            surprised too myself, Socrates, if Gorgias can point out to <lb/>
            you any greater good in his own art than I in mine; I should <lb/>
            make answer to him again as to the other, And who may <lb/>
            you be, my friend, I should like to know? and what's your <lb/>
            business? A professor of gymnastics, he would say; and my <lb/>
            business is to make men strong and handsome in their per- <lb/>
            sons. And next to the training-master the tradesman, I dare <lb/>
            say, would tell us with a lofty scorn of them all, Do pray <lb/>
            consider, Socrates, whether you think that there is any <lb/>
            blessing superior to wealth, either in the eyes of Gorgias or <lb/>
            of any one else whatsoever. We should say to him accord- <lb/>
            ingly, What's that pray? are you the man that makes that? <lb/>
            He would say yes. And what's your name? A man of busi- <lb/>
            ness. How then? do you judge wealth to be the greatest <lb/>
            blessing to mankind? we shall say. Of course I do, he will <lb/>
            reply. Aye, but Gorgias here contends that his own art is the <lb/>
            source of greater good than yours, we should say. Plainly <lb/>
            then his next question would be, And what is this good? let <lb/>
            Gorgias make answer. Come then, Gorgias, consider your- <lb/>
            self to be questioned by them as well as me, and answer us <lb/>
            what is that which you say is the greatest good to mankind, <lb/>
            and that you can produce it.</p>
          <p>Gor. That, Socrates, which really is the greatest good <lb/>
            and the cause at once of freedom to men in general in their <lb/>
            own persons, and no less to the individual In an of acquiring <lb/>
            power over others in his own city.</p>
          <p>Soc. What name then pray do you give to this ?</p>
          <p>Gor. The power of persuading by words, I should call <lb/>
            it, the judges in a court of law, or the councillors in a <lb/>
            council-room, or the assembly men in an assembly, or any <lb/>
            other kind of meeting which is convened for a public pur- <lb/>
            pose. And yet (in spite of all you have said) by the aid of <lb/>
            this talent you may make the physician your slave, and <lb/>
            the trainer your slave: and for your famous man of busi- <lb/>
            ness, it will turn out that he makes his money for somebody <lb/>
             <pb n="11"/>
            else and not for himself, but for you who have the power <lb/>
            of speaking and gaining the ear of the multitudes.</p>
          <p>Soc. Now, Gorgias, I think you have come very near <note type="margin"> c. 8. </note> <lb/>
            to an explanation of what you understand by the art of <lb/>
            rhetoric, and, if I at all enter into your meaning, you define <note type="chapter"> 453 </note> <lb/>
            rhetoric to be the artificer of persuasion, and you say that <lb/>
            its entire business and the whole sum and substance of it <lb/>
            results in this. Or have you any power to mention that <lb/>
            rhetoric possesses beyond that of producing persuasion in the <lb/>
            minds of the hearers ?</p>
          <p>Gor. None at all, Socrates ; your definition seems to me <lb/>
            to be sufficient; this is no doubt the sum and substance <lb/>
            of it.</p>
          <p>Soc. Then listen to me, Gorgias. I flatter myself, you <lb/>
            may be quite sure, that if there be any one else1 in the <lb/>
            whole world that engages in a discussion from a genuine <lb/>
            desire to know just what the argument is about and no <lb/>
            more, I too am one of that sort; and I make no doubt that <lb/>
            you are another.</p>
          <p>Gor. Well, what then, Socrates ?</p>
          <p>Soc. I'll tell you directly. What your view is of the <lb/>
            exact nature of the persuasion produced by rhetoric, and of <lb/>
            the subjects to which it is applied, I assure you I by no <lb/>
            means clearly understand; though at the same time I have a <lb/>
            kind of suspicion of what I suppose you to mean by it, <lb/>
            and what it deals with. Still I will ask you nevertheless <lb/>
            what you do mean by the persuasion that proceeds from <lb/>
            rhetoric, and what are the objects on which it is exercised. <note type="footnote"> 1 The word 'else,' just like the Greek <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄλλος</foreign>, with which it may be etymo- <lb/>
            logically connected, as well as 'other' 'the rest' and so on, are frequently <lb/>
            found in the best English writers where they are redundant or involve a logical <lb/>
            and grammatical inconsistency. I have elsewhere quoted Macbeth, 'Of all <lb/>
            men else I have avoided thee.' </note><note type="footnote"> The explanation of this logical blunder, and the false grammar which ex- <lb/>
            presses it, in the two classes of idioms in which it appears in Greek, I reserve <lb/>
            for a more appropriate occasion than that which is offered by the notes to a <lb/>
            mere translation. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="12"/>
            Now why when I have a suspicion about the matter my- <lb/>
            self am I going to ask you instead of myself stating it? <lb/>
            It is not on your account (not to refute or annoy you), <lb/>
            but for the sake of the argument, that it may proceed in <lb/>
            such a way as may make the subject of our conversation <lb/>
            most clear to us. For see now if you don't think I am <lb/>
            right in repeating my question. Take a parallel case. If <lb/>
            my question had been, to what class of painters does Zeuxis <lb/>
            belong? had you replied, he is a figure-painter, would it <lb/>
            not have been quite fair in me to ask you, what sort of <lb/>
            figures he paints, and on what occasions ?</p>
          <p>Gor. Quite so.</p>
          <p>Soc. And is not the reason this, that there are besides <lb/>
            him other painters employed upon a number of other figures?</p>
          <p>Gor. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. But if no one else were a painter but Zeuxis, <lb/>
            your answer would have been right enough ?</p>
          <p>Gor. Of course it would.</p>
          <p>Soo. Well then tell me about rhetoric in the same <lb/>
            way; whether it is your opinion that rhetoric is the only <lb/>
            art that produces persuasion, or others besides it. What <lb/>
            I mean is something of this sort: when any one teaches <lb/>
            anything, does he persuade in teaching it ? or do you think <lb/>
            otherwise ?</p>
          <p>Gor. Certainly not, Socrates; on the contrary, he most <lb/>
            assuredly does persuade.</p>
          <p>Soc. And again, if we apply our question to the same <lb/>
            arts as we mentioned just now, does not numeration, or the <lb/>
            man conversant with that science, teach us all the properties <lb/>
            of number ?</p>
          <p>Gor. Yes, no doubt.</p>
          <p>Soc. And so likewise persuades ?</p>
          <p>Gor. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. Then numeration also is an artificer of persuasion ?</p>
          <p>Gor. It seems so.</p>
          <p>Soc. So then if we are asked what kind of persuasion <lb/>
             <pb n="13"/>
            and what about, we shall reply I presume, that which <lb/>
            conveys instruction, which deals with the amounts of all <note type="chapter"> 454 </note> <lb/>
            the odd and even numbers. And we shall be able to show <lb/>
            that all the rest of the arts that we were just now referring <lb/>
            to are artificers of persuasion, and what that is, and what it <lb/>
            is about. Shan't we ?</p>
          <p>Go?-. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. It follows that rhetoric is not the only artificer of <lb/>
            persuasion.</p>
          <p>Go?-. True.</p>
          <p>Soc. Since then it is not the only one that effects <note type="margin"> c. 9. </note> <lb/>
            this object, but others besides it, we should be entitled next <lb/>
            to put a further question to the speaker, as we did in the <lb/>
            case of the painter, What sort of persuasion then is it of which <lb/>
            rhetoric is the art, and what is that persuasion about ? You <lb/>
            think it would be fair, don't you, to put such a further ques- <lb/>
            tion ?</p>
          <p>Gor. Oh, yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. Answer me then, Gorgias, since you agree with <lb/>
            me in this view.</p>
          <p>Gor. Well then I mean that kind of persuasion, <lb/>
            Socrates, which is exercised in law-courts and any other <lb/>
            great crowds, as indeed I said just now; and it is about <lb/>
            everything that is just and unjust.</p>
          <p>Soc. I had a suspicion myself, to tell you the truth, <lb/>
            Gorgias, that that was the kind of persuasion you meant, <lb/>
            and that those were its objects: but that you may not be <lb/>
            surprised if I ask you by and by some such question as <lb/>
            seems to be quite clear, though I repeat it-for, as I say, <lb/>
            I do so in order that our argument may be brought <lb/>
            regularly to a conclusion; not on your account (for the <lb/>
            pleasure of annoying or refuting you), but that we may not <lb/>
            get into the habit of snatching up an over-hasty conclusion <lb/>
            as to one another's meaning founded on a mere guess, but <lb/>
            that you may state your views as you think fit according to <lb/>
            your own notions.</p><pb n="14"/>
            
          <p>Gor. Indeed, Socrates, in my opinion you are doing <lb/>
            quite right.</p>
          <p>Soc. Come then, let this he the next thing we ex- <lb/>
            amine. There is such a thing as what you call to have <lb/>
            learnt'?</p>
          <p>Gor. There is.</p>
          <p>Soc. And again 'to have believed' ?</p>
          <p>Gor. Oh, yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. Do you think then to have learnt and to have <lb/>
            believed, and learning and believing, are the same thing, <lb/>
            or something different?</p>
          <p>Gor. Different, I should think, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Soc. And quite right too: and you may be sure of it <lb/>
            from this. If you were asked, Is there such a thing, <lb/>
            Gorgias, as false as well as true belief? you would say yes, <lb/>
            I presume.</p>
          <p>GOT. I should.</p>
          <p>Soc. But again, is there false as well as true knowledge?</p>
          <p>GOT. Certainly not.</p>
          <p>Soc. To be sure, because it plainly appears a second <lb/>
            time that they are not identical1.</p>
          <p>Gor. True.</p>
          <p>Soc. But still those that have learnt are persuaded, <lb/>
            as well as those that have believed.</p>
          <p>Gor. It is so.</p>
          <p>Soc. Would you have us then assume two forms of per- <lb/>
            suasion, the one conveying belief without knowledge, the <lb/>
            other knowledge?</p>
          <p>GOT. Yes, by all means.</p>
          <p>Soc. Then which of the two kinds of persuasion is it <lb/>
            that rhetoric effects in law-courts or any other large as- <lb/>
            semblies on the subject of right and wrong? Is it that <note type="footnote"> 1 In this sentence <foreign xml:lang="grc">γάρ</foreign> has reference to Gorgias' decided <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐδαμῶς</foreign>. ' You <lb/>
            deny it so readily and so positively, because, here again, by this second process <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">αὖ</foreign>), it is quite plain that they are not the same.' </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="15"/>
            which gives rise to belief without knowledge, or that from <lb/>
            which knowledge springs?</p>
          <p>Gor. Plainly, of course, Socrates, that which gives rise <lb/>
            to belief.</p>
          <p>Soc. Rhetoric then, it seems, is an artificer of persuasion <note type="chapter"> 455 </note> <lb/>
            productive of belief but not of instruction in matters of <lb/>
            right and wrong.</p>
          <p>Gor. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. Nor consequently is the rhetorician qualified to <lb/>
            instruct law-courts or any other large masses of people on <lb/>
            questions of right and wrong, but only to persuade them. <lb/>
            For surely he never could be able to instruct such a great <lb/>
            crowd in things of such importance in a few minutes.</p>
          <p>Go?-. Certainly not.</p>
          <p>Soc. Come, then, let us see what we do actually mean <note type="margin"> c. 10. </note> <lb/>
            by rhetoric: for to tell you the truth, 1 cant yet distinctly <lb/>
            make out even myself what my own opinion is. Whenever <lb/>
            the city holds a meeting for the election of state-physicians <lb/>
            or shipwrights or any other class of craftsmen, will not on <lb/>
            such occasions the rhetorician refrain from offering his advice ? <lb/>
            plainly because in every election we are bound to choose the <lb/>
            most skilful practitioner. Or, again, as to the building of <lb/>
            walls, or the construction of harbours or docks, it is not he <lb/>
            that will give advice, but the master-builders. Or, again, <lb/>
            when advice is to be given upon the election of generals, or <lb/>
            the disposition of troops to meet an enemy, or the occupa- <lb/>
            tion of military positions, on such occasions it is the military <lb/>
            men that will advise, and not the rhetoricians. Or what <lb/>
            say you, Gorgias, to such cases? For as you profess to be <lb/>
            a speaker yourself and to qualify others for speaking, it is <lb/>
            right to learn your opinion upon the matters of your own <lb/>
            art. So pray suppose that I am acting now with a view to <lb/>
            your interests. For very likely one of the present company <lb/>
            here may be desirous of becoming a pupil of yours-as in <lb/>
            fact I think I see some, and I dare say a good many—who <lb/>
            perhaps might be ashamed to trouble you with repeated <lb/>
             <pb n="16"/>
            questions. And so when I repeat mine, suppose yourself to <lb/>
            he questioned by them as well. What good shall we get, <lb/>
            Gorgias, by frequenting your society? On what subjects shall <lb/>
            we be able to offer advice to the city? is it about right and <lb/>
            wrong alone, or all those things besides which Socrates was <lb/>
            just now mentioning? Try then to give them an answer.</p>
          <p>Gor. Well, Socrates, I will try to reveal to you clearly <lb/>
            the entire force and meaning of rhetoric : in fact you pointed <lb/>
            out the way very well yourself. You know, I presume, that <lb/>
            yonder docks and walls, the pride of your city1,and the <lb/>
            construction of your harbours, are due to the counsels of <lb/>
            Themistocles, and partly to those of Pericles, but not to the <lb/>
            masters of the several crafts.</p>
          <p>Soc. So I am told, Gorgias, of Themistocles; Pericles I <lb/>
            heard myself when he gave us his advice about building <lb/>
            the ‘middle wall2.'</p>
          <p><note type="chapter"> 456 </note> Gor. And so you see, Socrates, that wherever there is an <lb/>
            election of such officers as you were just speaking of, it is <lb/>
            the orators that give advice, and carry their opinions in <lb/>
            such matters.</p>
          <p>Soc. It is exactly because I was so surprised at this that <lb/>
            I have been asking ever so long what the virtue of rhetoric <lb/>
            can possibly be. For regarded in this light its grandeur <lb/>
            and importance appear to me to be something quite super- <lb/>
            natural.</p>
          <p>Gor. Aye, if you knew all, Socrates, how it embraces <note type="footnote"> 1 On the difference between To. <foreign xml:lang="grc">νεώριαΚ</foreign>al <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰτείχητὰΆθηναίν</foreign>and <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῶν <lb/>

            under it every kind of power, as one may say. I will give <lb/>
            you a convincing proof of it. I myself have often ere now, <lb/>
            in company with my brother (Herodicus), or any other <lb/>
            physician, gone into the house of one of their patients, and <lb/>
            upon his refusing to take their medicines, or to submit to be <lb/>
            operated upon either by the knife or the cautery, when the <lb/>
            physician failed to persuade him, I succeeded, by the aid <lb/>
            of no other art than that of rhetoric. And I maintain too <lb/>
            that if a physician and a rhetorician went together into any <lb/>
            city you please, supposing they had to argue out the ques- <lb/>
            tion before a general assembly or any other kind of meeting <lb/>
            which of the two was to be elected, orator or physician, <lb/>
            the latter would be totally extinguished (totally eclipsed, alto- <lb/>
            gether distanced), and the able speaker elected if he chose. <lb/>
            And if the contest lay between him and the master of any <lb/>
            other craft you please to name, the rhetorician would carry <lb/>
            his own election sooner than any one else whatever: for <lb/>
            there is no subject in the world on which the rhetorician <lb/>
            could not speak more persuasively than the master of any <lb/>
            other art whatsoever, before a multitude. Such then is the <lb/>
            extent and such the quality of the power of this art. We <lb/>
            are bound however, Socrates, to employ rhetoric in the same <lb/>
            way as every other kind of exercise. For in fact all other <lb/>
            exercises are not to be employed against every body indis- <lb/>
            criminately merely because a man has become such a pro- <lb/>
            ficient in boxing and wrestling or the use of arms as to have <lb/>
            the advantage over friend and foe: this does not entitle him <lb/>
            to knock his friends down or stab or assassinate them. No <lb/>
            by my faith, nor again if any one were to frequent a <lb/>
            wrestling-school until he had got his body into prime con- <lb/>
            dition, and become an expert pugilist, and then go and strike <lb/>
            his father and his mother or any other of his relations or <lb/>
            friends, would that be any reason for conceiving an aversion <lb/>
            to trainers and fencing-masters, and expelling them from our <lb/>
            cities. For they no doubt gave their lessons to these pupils <lb/>
            of theirs with a view to the proper employment of them <note type="footnote"> 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="18"/>
            against enemies and wrong-doers, in self-defence, not aggres- <note type="chapter"> 457 </note> <lb/>
            sion : whereas the others pervert their strength and their <lb/>
            art to an improper use. Yet it does not follow that the <lb/>
            teachers are rogues, nor that their art is either to blame <lb/>
            for all this, or bad in itself; but those that misuse it, in my <lb/>
            opinion. For it is true that the orator is able to speak against <lb/>
            every body and upon every question in such a way as to find <lb/>
            greater acceptance with all large assemblies, on any subject <lb/>
            in a word he chooses. But he is none the more entitled on <lb/>
            that account to rob either the physicians of their due credit, <lb/>
            because he could do it if he liked, or artists of any other <lb/>
            kind; but he is bound to use his rhetoric fairly, like skill in <lb/>
            any other exercise. But it seems to me that, supposing a <lb/>
            man to make himself a rhetorician and then to use this <lb/>
            faculty and this art to commit wrong, it is not the teacher <lb/>
            that ought to incur odium and to be banished from our-cities. <lb/>
            For he gave his lessons to be turned to a fair use, but the <lb/>
            other perverts them. It is therefore he that abuses the art <lb/>
            that may fairly be held in aversion and banished or put to <lb/>
            death, and not the teacher.</p>
          <p><note type="margin"> c. 12 </note> Soc. I believe, Gorgias, that you like myself have had a <lb/>
            good deal of experience in arguments, and in the course of <lb/>
            them have arrived at the discovery of something of this sort, <lb/>
            that it is no easy matter for people to come to any definite <lb/>
            agreement upon any questions they may have undertaken to <lb/>
            discuss, and after giving and receiving instruction so to bring <lb/>
            the conversation to an end; but on the contrary, if a dispute <lb/>
            arises between them upon any point, and the one declares <lb/>
            that the other expresses himself either incorrectly or indis- <lb/>
            tinctly, they get angry, and suppose that what is said pro- <lb/>
            ceeds from jealousy of themselves, from a spirit of mere <lb/>
            rivalry, and not from a wish to sift the question proposed for <lb/>
            discussion. And in fact occasionally this results at last in <lb/>
            the most indecent scenes, in mutual abuse and recrimination <lb/>
            of such a kind that even the bystanders are vexed on their <lb/>
            own account that they ever condescended to listen to such a <lb/>
             <pb n="19"/>
            set of fellows. What then is my motive in saying this ? It <lb/>
            is because your present statements don't seem to me quite <lb/>
            consistent or in harmony with what you said at first about <lb/>
            rhetoric. Now I am afraid to refute you, for fear you should <lb/>
            suppose that I speak with a disputatious object, not with a <lb/>
            view to throw light upon the subject under discussion, but <lb/>
            aiming at you personally. Now if you are one of the same <note type="chapter"> 458 </note> <lb/>
            sort of persons as I am myself, I should be glad to continue <lb/>
            my questions, but if not, I would rather let it alone. And <lb/>
            what sort of person am I? I am one of those that would be <lb/>
            glad to be refuted when I assert! anything that is untrue, and <lb/>
            glad to refute any one else supposing he fall! into any error; <lb/>
            but just as glad to be refuted as to refute, because I consider <lb/>
            it a greater benefit, in proportion as the benefit is greater to <lb/>
            be delivered oneself from the greatest evil than to deliver <lb/>
            another. For I think that there is no evil that can befall a <lb/>
            man so great as a false opinion upon the subjects which we <lb/>
            now have under discussion. Now if you as well as myself <lb/>
            profess yourself to be one of this sort let us go on with the <lb/>
            conversation: but if on the other hand you think we had <lb/>
            better drop it, let us at once dismiss it and break off the <lb/>
            argument.</p>
          <p>Go?-. Nay, Socrates, I myself like you pretend to be one <lb/>
            of that sort of persons whose character you are sketching: <lb/>
            perhaps however we ought also to have consulted the con- <lb/>
            venience of the company present. For to say the truth, for <lb/>
            some time before you came I had been delivering a long <lb/>
            address to our friends here, and now again if we go on with <lb/>
            our discussion we shall very likely protract it to a consider- <lb/>
            able length. We ought therefore to consider their inclina- <note type="footnote"> 1 Observe here the politeness of Socrates. In speaking of his own liability <lb/>
            to error he uses the indicative mood, making a definite and positive supposition, <lb/>
            and assuming the probability of the occurrence. In speaking of a similar in- <lb/>
            firmity in others the optative is substituted for the indicative, implying the uncer- <lb/>
            tainty of the event, and avoiding the assertion that such a thing is at all likely <lb/>
            to happen. There is the same distinction in our own language between the in- <lb/>
            dicative and subjunctive after 'if.' </note> <note type="footnote"> 2—2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="20"/>
            tions as well as our own, and not to detain them when they <lb/>
            may be wanting to do something else. (Sensation).</p>
          <p><note type="margin"> c. 13 </note> Chœr. You hear yourselves, Gorgias and Socrates, the <lb/>
            applause of our friends there, how anxious they are to hear <lb/>
            any thing you have to say. For my own part however, God <lb/>
            forbid that I should ever be so busy as to give up an argu- <lb/>
            ment so important and so well treated because I preferred <lb/>
            doing anything else.</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes, by my faith, Chærephon. And indeed for my- <lb/>
            self, though I have been present ere now at plenty of dis- <lb/>
            cussions I don't know that I ever in my life was so much <lb/>
            gratified as on the present occasion; and therefore as far as <lb/>
            I am concerned, if you choose to go on talking all day long <lb/>
            you will do me a favour.</p>
          <p>Soc. Well you may be sure, Callicles, there is nothing to <lb/>
            prevent it on my part, if Gorgias consents.</p>
          <p>Gor. After this Socrates, it would indeed be a shame <lb/>
            for me to hang back, when I myself challenged the company <lb/>
            to ask me any question they pleased. But if our friends <lb/>
            here are of this mind, go on with the conversation and ask <lb/>
            me what you like.</p>
          <p>Soc. Then let me tell you, Gorgias, what surprises me in <lb/>
            the words you used: to be sure I dare say you are right and <lb/>
            it is I that misunderstand you. You say you are able to <lb/>
            qualify any one for speaking who chooses to become your <lb/>
            pupil.</p>
          <p>Gor. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. Does that mean then that he is qualified to gain <lb/>
            the ear of a crowd on any subject, not by way of instruction <lb/>
            but persuasion?</p>
          <p><note type="chapter"> 459 </note> Gor . Just so.</p>
          <p>Soc. You said just now if I mistake not that in sanitary <lb/>
            matters too the orator will be more persuasive than the <lb/>
            physician ?</p>
          <p>GOT. I certainly did, in a crowd that is to say.</p>
          <p>Soc. Well and doesn't 'a crowd' mean the ignorant? for <lb/>
             <pb n="21"/>
            surely amongst the well-informed he wont carry more weight <lb/>
            than the physician?</p>
          <p>Go?-. Quite true.</p>
          <p>Soc. And so if he is to be better able to persuade than <lb/>
            the physician, he becomes better able to persuade than the <lb/>
            man of real knowledge ?</p>
          <p>Go?-. Yes certainly.</p>
          <p>Soc. Not being a physician though, is he?</p>
          <p>Gor. True.</p>
          <p>Soc. But one who is not a physician is unversed I pre- <lb/>
            sume in the art of which the physician is master.</p>
          <p>Gor. Plainly so.</p>
          <p>Soc. It follows then that the ignorant man will be more <lb/>
            persuasive among the ignorant than the man of real informa- <lb/>
            tion, supposing the orator to be more persuasive than the <lb/>
            physician. Does this follow, or any thing else?</p>
          <p>Go?-. In this case no doubt it does.</p>
          <p>Soc. And so likewise in respect of all the rest of the arts <lb/>
            the case is the same with the orator and with rhetoric; there <lb/>
            is no occasion, that is to say, for them to be acquainted with <lb/>
            the things themselves, but it is enough for them to have <lb/>
            discovered some instrument of persuasion which may enable <lb/>
            them to present the appearance to the ignorant of know- <lb/>
            ing better than the well informed.</p>
          <p>Gor. Well and isn't it a great comfort, Socrates, with- <note type="margin"> c. 14 </note> <lb/>
            out learning any of the other arts, but with this one alone, to <lb/>
            be at no disadvantage in comparison with the professional <lb/>
            people ?</p>
          <p>Soc. Whether the rhetorician is or is not at a disad- <lb/>
            vantage with the rest of the world by reason of this state of <lb/>
            things [or, in consequence of this character, these qualifica- <lb/>
            tions of his] we will examine by and by, if we find that our <lb/>
            argument requires it; but just at present let us consider this <lb/>
            first, whether the rhetorician stands in the same relation to <lb/>
            what is just and unjust and base and noble and good and bad, <lb/>
            as to what is wholesome and the several objects of all the <lb/>
             <pb n="22"/>
            other arts; that is to say, that he is ignorant of what is good <lb/>
            or bad or honourable or disgraceful or just or unjust, in itself, <lb/>
            but has devised the means of persuasion about them, so as <lb/>
            with no knowledge at all to get the credit amongst the <lb/>
            ignorant of knowing better than the man of real knowledge? <lb/>
            Or is this knowledge absolutely required? and must any one <lb/>
            who means to learn rhetoric be prepared with all this before <lb/>
            he comes to you? or if not, shall you the master of the art <lb/>
            give one who does come no instruction at all in these <lb/>
            matters-for it's no business of yours-but make him in the <lb/>
            eyes of the vulgar seem to know things of this kind when he <lb/>
            doesn't, and seem to be good when he isn't? or will you be <lb/>
            altogether unable to teach him rhetoric unless he have a <lb/>
            previous acquaintance with the truth in these matters? or <note type="chapter"> 460 </note> <lb/>
            what are the real facts of the case, Gorgias? Do in heaven's <lb/>
            name, as you said just now, draw aside the veil and tell us <lb/>
            in what the virtue of rhetoric really does consist.</p>
          <p>Go?-. Well I suppose, Socrates, if he does not know all <lb/>
            this already I shall have to teach him this as well.</p>
          <p>Soc. Hold there (don't say any more), for that is well <lb/>
            said. If you make a man a rhetorician he must needs be <lb/>
            acquainted with what is just and unjust either beforehand, or <lb/>
            afterwards from your instructions.</p>
          <p>Gor. Just so.</p>
          <p>Soc. How then ? one who has learnt the art of building <lb/>
            is a builder, isn't he ?</p>
          <p>Gor. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. And so one who has learnt music a musician ?</p>
          <p>Gor. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. And one who has studied medicine a physician? <lb/>
            and so on for all the rest upon the same principle; every one <lb/>
            who has studied any particular subject acquires that cha- <lb/>
            racter which is imparted to him by the knowledge of it ?</p>
          <p>Gor. No doubt.</p>
          <p>Soc. And so likewise by the same rule one that has <lb/>
            learnt justice is a just man ?</p><pb n="23"/>
            
          <p>Go?-. Most undoubtedly.</p>
          <p>Soc. But the just man it is to be presumed does just <lb/>
            things.</p>
          <p>Gor. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. So then must the rhetorician needs be a just man, <lb/>
            and the just man desire to act justly ?</p>
          <p>Gor. Yes, so it appears.</p>
          <p>Soc. Consequently the just man will never desire to do <lb/>
            wrong.</p>
          <p>Gor. Necessarily.</p>
          <p>Soc. And it follows from what we said that the rheto- <lb/>
            rician must be a just man.</p>
          <p>Gor. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. Consequently the rhetorician will never desire to do <lb/>
            wrong.</p>
          <p>Gor. No, it seems not.</p>
          <p>Soc. Then do you remember saying a little while ago <note type="margin"> c. 15 </note> <lb/>
            that we have no right to find fault with the training masters <lb/>
            nor expel them from our cities if a boxer makes an unfair <lb/>
            use of his boxing and does wrong ? and so in like manner <lb/>
            if an orator employs his rhetoric unfairly, we are not accuse <lb/>
            the teacher or expel him from the city, but the man that <lb/>
            does the wrong and misuses his rhetoric? was that said <lb/>
            or not ?</p>
          <p>Go?-. It was.</p>
          <p>Soc. But now it appears that that very same person, the <lb/>
            rhetorician, never could have been guilty of any wrong at <lb/>
            all, doesn't it ?</p>
          <p>Gor. It does.</p>
          <p>Soc. And at the beginning of our conversation, Gorgias, <lb/>
            it was stated that rhetoric deals with words, not words about <lb/>
            even and odd numbers, but about what is just and unjust; <lb/>
            wasn't it ?</p>
          <p>Go?-. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. Well I supposed at the very time when you made <lb/>
            that remark that rhetoric never could be an unjust thing, <lb/>
             <pb n="24"/>
            when all the speeches that it makes arc about justice; but, <note type="chapter"> 461 </note> <lb/>
            when you told us shortly after that the orator might make an <lb/>
            unjust use of his rhetoric, then I was surprised, and thinking <lb/>
            that the two assertions did not harmonize with one another I <lb/>
            said what I did, that if you thought it like myself an advan- <lb/>
            tage to be refuted it was advisable to continue the conversa- <lb/>
            tion, or if not to let it drop : and now that we afterwards <lb/>
            come to examine the point, you see yourself that we are come <lb/>
            again to the conclusion that it is impossible for the rheto- <lb/>
            rician to make an unjust use of his rhetoric or consent to do <lb/>
            wrong. Now to sift this matter thoroughly and satisfactorily <lb/>
            to make out what the exact truth of it may be, by the dog, <lb/>
            Gorgias, is a thing not to be done in a short interview.</p>
          <p><note type="margin"> c. 16 </note> Pol. How's that, Socrates ? is that your real opinion <lb/>
            about rhetoric that you are now stating? Or do you suppose <lb/>
            because Gorgias was ashamed not to admit that the rhetori- <lb/>
            cian is acquainted with justice and honour and good, and if a <lb/>
            pupil come to him without knowing all this that he will <lb/>
            teach it himself-and then from this admission there followed <lb/>
            I dare say some slight inconsistency in the expressions he <lb/>
            used-just what you are so fond of, when it was you yourself <lb/>
            that turned the conversation upon questions of that sort1 ? <note type="footnote"> 1 In the foregoing sentence, if <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅτιι</foreign>s rendered ‘because,’as it probably <lb/>
            should be, there is an anacoluthon. Stallbaum in his 3rd ed. supposes that <lb/>
            Polus means to deny that there is any inconsistency, and therefore thinks that <lb/>
            the anacoluthon resides in the change of <foreign xml:lang="grc">συμβη̑ναι</foreign>,which should follow <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἴει</foreign>, <lb/>
            into <foreign xml:lang="grc">συνέβη</foreign>: and that the note of interrogation should be removed after <foreign xml:lang="grc">διδάξεν</foreign> <lb/>
            and a comma substituted. As I believe that the supposition upon which this <lb/>
            rendering is based is incorrect, I prefer following the Zurich Editors and re- <lb/>
            taining the note of interrogation. The entire sentence down to <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐρωτήμαται</foreign>s <lb/>
            irregular; and this irregularity is very likely meant to express, as Stallbaum <lb/>
            conjectures, the impetuosity and precipitation by which Polus' language is cha- <lb/>
            racterised. I have rendere dat as if the apodosis were wanting after <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἴειὅτι</foreign>. <lb/>
            This would naturally be, 'think you because ......that this is really his opinion, <lb/>
            and that you have any right to triumph over him?' and this is implied in what <lb/>
            follows. If <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅτιι</foreign>s rendered ‘that,’the meaning is, 'or rather, think you, <lb/>
            that...' i.e. don't you rather think that. Heindorf's version is 'an (quod res <lb/>
            est) pudore deterritum Gorgiam putas...' which is tantamount to the pre- <lb/>
            ceding. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="25"/>
            For who do you think is likely to deny either that he is <lb/>
            acquainted with justice himself, or can teach it to others ? <lb/>
            Nay, it is very unmannerly (ill bred, bad taste in you) to <lb/>
            turn the conversation upon such things as these.</p>
          <p>Soc. Well to be sure, fairest Polus, it is precisely for this <lb/>
            reason that we provide ourselves with friends and children <lb/>
            that as soon as the advance of age has made our footing uncer- <lb/>
            tain you youngsters may be there to set our life on its legs <lb/>
            again in word as well as in deed. And now if Gorgias and <lb/>
            I are making any false step in our argument there you are to <lb/>
            set us right again: indeed you are bound to do so. And I <lb/>
            on my part am ready if you think any of our conclusions are <lb/>
            wrong to retract any one of them you please, provided only <lb/>
            you do me the favour (<foreign xml:lang="grc">μοι</foreign>) to observe just one thing.</p>
          <p>Pol. What thing do you mean ?</p>
          <p>Soc. To keep that discursive style of yours in check, <lb/>
            Polus, which you made the attempt to indulge in at first.</p>
          <p>Pol. How ? Mayn't I be allowed to say as much as I please ?</p>
          <p>Soc. It would indeed be hard upon you, my admirable <lb/>
            friend, if you were to have come to Athens, where there is <lb/>
            the greatest freedom of speech in all Greece, and then you <lb/>
            were to be the only person there who was debarred from it. <lb/>
            But just set my case against yours. If you make a long <lb/>
            speech and refuse to reply to my questions, wouldn't it be <lb/>
            equally hard upon me not to be allowed to go away and not <lb/>
            listen to you ? No, no, if you have any regard for the argu- <note type="chapter"> 4G2 </note> <lb/>
            ment we have been holding and want to set it right again, as <lb/>
            I said just now take back any thing you please, and in your <lb/>
            turn questioning and questioned, like myself and Gorgias, <lb/>
            refute or submit to refutation. For you claim to be ac- <lb/>
            quainted with all that Gorgias knows, I believe, don't you ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes to be sure I do.</p>
          <p>Soc. Then I suppose you like him invite people on all <lb/>
            occasions to put any question to you they like as one that <lb/>
            knows how to find an answer ?</p>
          <p>Pol. No doubt I do.</p><pb n="26"/>
            
          <p>Soc. Well then now, either put the questions or answer <lb/>
            them, whichever you like.</p>
          <p><note type="margin"> c. 17 </note> Pol. Well, so I will. Answer me then, Socrates. Since <lb/>
            you seem to think that Gorgias is at a loss about rhetoric, <lb/>
            what do you say it is yourself?</p>
          <p>Soc. Do you ask me what art I say it is ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes I do.</p>
          <p>Soc. None at all, it seems to me, Polus, to tell you the <lb/>
            exact truth.</p>
          <p>Pol. Well what do you take rhetoric to be then ?</p>
          <p>Soc. A thing which you tell us in the work that I lately <lb/>
            read gave rise to art.</p>
          <p>Pol. What thing do you mean ?</p>
          <p>Soc. I mean a kind of acquired habit (or ‘routine,’ <lb/>
            Cousin).</p>
          <p>Pol. So you take rhetoric to be an acquired habit ?</p>
          <p>Soc. Yes I do-if you have no particular objection.</p>
          <p>Pol. A habit of what ?</p>
          <p>Soc. Of the production of a sort of gratification and <lb/>
            pleasure.</p>
          <p>Pol. Well and don't you think rhetoric a very fine thing, <lb/>
            to be able to oblige one's fellow creatures ?</p>
          <p>Soc. Hallo, Polus, have I told you yet what I say it is, <lb/>
            that you think yourself entitled to ask what follows that, <lb/>
            whether I don't think it very fine ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Why, haven't you told me that you call it a sort of <lb/>
            habit ?</p>
          <p>Soc. Will you please then, since you set such a high <lb/>
            value on ' obliging,' to oblige me in a trifling matter ?</p>
          <p>Pol. To be sure I will.</p>
          <p>Soc. Ask me now what art I take cookery to be.</p>
          <p>Pol. I ask you then, what art is cookery ?</p>
          <p>Soc. None at all, Polus.</p>
          <p>Pol. Well what is it? tell us.</p>
          <p>Soc. I tell you then, a sort of habit.</p>
          <p>Pol. Of what ? let us hear.</p><pb n="27"/>
            
          <p>Soc. What I say is, of the production of gratification <lb/>
            and pleasure, Polus.</p>
          <p>Pol. Do you mean to say then that cookery and rhetoric <lb/>
            are the same thing ?</p>
          <p>Soc. Oh dear no, but a branch of the same kind of <lb/>
            pursuit.</p>
          <p>Pol. What pursuit do you mean ?</p>
          <p>Soc. I fear it may be somewhat rude to say the truth : <lb/>
            for on Gorgias' account I am reluctant to speak out, for fear <lb/>
            he should suppose that I am satirizing his professional pur- <lb/>
            suits. At the same time whether this is the kind of rhetoric <note type="chapter">463 </note> <lb/>
            that Gorgias practises, I really don't know; for in fact from <lb/>
            our argument just now we arrived at no distinct notion of <lb/>
            his views on this matter. But what I mean by rhetoric <lb/>
            is a branch of a particular set of things which have nothing <lb/>
            £ fine' about them at all.</p>
          <p>Gor. What is it, Socrates, pray let us know; don't hesi- <lb/>
            tate on my account.</p>
          <p>Soc. It seems to me then, Gorgias, to be a sort of pur- <note type="margin"> c. 18 </note> <lb/>
            suit not scientific at all, but of a shrewd and bold spirit, <lb/>
            quick and clever in its dealings with the world. And the <lb/>
            sum and substance of it I call flattery [coaxing or wheedling]. <lb/>
            Amongst a great number of branches of this kind of study <lb/>
            one in particular I take to be cookery: which has indeed <lb/>
            the appearance of an art, but according to my view is no art, <lb/>
            but a habit and a knack. Of this I call the art of rhetoric a <lb/>
            branch, as well as that of dressing and adorning oneself and <lb/>
            of sophistic, four branches of it applied to four varieties of <lb/>
            things. If then Polus wishes to make any inquiry, let him do <lb/>
            so: for he has not yet heard which sort of branch of flattery <lb/>
            I pronounce rhetoric to be; but without observing that I <lb/>
            have not yet answered that question, he goes on to ask <lb/>
            further whether I don't think it a very fine thing. But I <lb/>
            wont answer him whether I think rhetoric a fine thing or a <lb/>
            foul one until I have first made answer what it is. For it is <lb/>
            not fair, Polus : but if you want to learn (what my opinion is), <lb/>
             <pb n="28"/>
            ask me what kind of branch of flattery I pronounce rhetoric <lb/>
            to be.</p>
          <p>Pol. I ask you then, and do you answer me, what kind <lb/>
            of branch ?</p>
          <p>Soc. I wonder whether you will understand me when <lb/>
            I do answer. Rhetoric is according to my view the unreal <lb/>
            image (counterfeit presentment) of a branch of Politics.</p>
          <p>Pol. Well then, do you say it is a fine thing or a foul <lb/>
            one ?</p>
          <p>Soc. A foul one, I should say, for all bad things I call <lb/>
            foul; since I must answer you as though you already under- <lb/>
            stood my meaning.</p>
          <p>Gor. No upon my word, Socrates; why I myself don't <lb/>
            understand what you say either.</p>
          <p>Soc. Like enough, Gorgias, for I have not yet explained <lb/>
            myself distinctly; but Polus (Colt) here is so young and <lb/>
            hot.</p>
          <p>Gor.Well never mind him ; but tell me what you mean <lb/>
            by saying that rhetoric is the unreal image of a branch of <lb/>
            Politics.</p>
          <p>Soc. Well I will try to tell you what rhetoric appears to <lb/>
            me to be : and if I am wrong Polus here will refute me. <lb/>
            There is such a thing I presume as what you call body and <lb/>
            soul ?</p>
          <p><note type="chapter"> 464 </note> Gor. Of course there is.</p>
          <p>Soc. And in these again you believe that there is a good <lb/>
            condition of each ?</p>
          <p>Gor. To be sure I do.</p>
          <p>Soc. And again, an apparent but not real good con- <lb/>
            dition ? Take a case like the following: there are many <lb/>
            that appear to have their bodies in good condition in whom <lb/>
            it would not be easy for any one but a physician or one of <lb/>
            your professors of gymnastics to discover that they are not so.</p>
          <p>Gor. Quite true.</p>
          <p>Soc. Something of this sort I say there is in body and <lb/>
            in soul, and that is what makes the body and the soul seem <lb/>
             <pb n="29"/>
            to be in good condition when they are not really so never- <lb/>
            theless.</p>
          <p>Gor. It is so.</p>
          <p>Soc. Let me see then if I can explain my meaning more <note type="margin"> c. 19</note> <lb/>
            clearly to you. Two classes of things have I say two arts <lb/>
            corresponding to them; that which has the soul under its <lb/>
            direction (or, that which is applied to the soul) I call Politics; <lb/>
            and though for that which has charge of the body I can't find <lb/>
            you just on the spur of the moment any single name, still <lb/>
            the care of the body is one and has as I reckon two divisions, <lb/>
            the one gymnastics and the other medicine. In Politics <lb/>
            against gymnastics I set legislation, and as the counterpart <lb/>
            to medicine I assign justice. In each of these pairs, how- <lb/>
            ever, medicine and gymnastics, justice and legislation, there <lb/>
            is a good deal of intercommunication seeing that they deal <lb/>
            severally with the same objects; yet still there is a difference <lb/>
            between them. Well then of these four, which always have <lb/>
            the highest good the one of the body the other of the soul <lb/>
            in view in their treatment of them, the art of flattery takes <lb/>
            note, and I don't say with a full knowledge but by a shrewd <lb/>
            guess divides herself into four branches, and then smuggling <lb/>
            herself into the guise of each of those other divisions pre- <lb/>
            tends to be that of which she has assumed the semblance, <lb/>
            and cares not one jot for what is best, but with the bait <lb/>
            of what is most agreeable for the moment angles for folly <lb/>
            and deludes it to such a degree as to get the credit of <lb/>
            being something of the highest value. And so I say cookery <lb/>
            has assumed the disguise of medicine, and pretends to the <lb/>
            knowledge of the kinds of food that are best for the body, <lb/>
            so that if a cook and a physician had to go through a <lb/>
            contest before a set of boys, or men as silly as boys, to de- <lb/>
            cide which of the two understood the subject of good and <lb/>
            bad kinds of food, the physician or the cook, the physician <lb/>
            would die of starvation. Now I call it flattery, and I say that <note type="chapter">465</note> <lb/>
            such a thing as this is base and contemptible, Polus—for <lb/>
            now I am addressing you—because it aims solely at what is <lb/>
             <pb n="30"/>
            agreeable without considering what is best: and an art I do <lb/>
            not call it but a habit, because it can render no account of <lb/>
            the exact nature of the things which it applies, and so cannot <lb/>
            tell the cause of any of them. But to nothing which is irra- <lb/>
            tional can I give the name of art. If you contest any of <note type="margin"> c. 20 </note> <lb/>
            these points I am ready to stand an examination. Now <lb/>
            as I say cookery has taken the disguise of medicine, and the <lb/>
            art of dressing in just the same way that of gymnastics, a <lb/>
            knavish and cozening and ignoble and illiberal art, cheating <lb/>
            people so by the aid of forms and colours and polish and <lb/>
            dress as to make them in the endeavour to assume a bor- <lb/>
            rowed beauty neglect the native and genuine beauty which <lb/>
            comes by gymnastics. However not to be tedious, I will <lb/>
            state the thing like the geometers—for by this time I dare <lb/>
            say you will be prepared to follow me—as the art of dressing <lb/>
            is to gymnastics so is cooking to medicine : or rather 'thus, <lb/>
            as dressing to gymnastics so is sophistic to legislation, and as <lb/>
            cookery to medicine so is rhetoric to justice1. However as I <lb/>
            say, though such is the natural distinction between them, <lb/>
            still, as these arts are so nearly allied, sophists and rhetoricians <lb/>
            and the things with which they deal are a good deal jumbled <note type="footnote">1 The 'justice' here spoken of is the principle of <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίκηἐπανορθωτικήο</foreign>r <lb/>

            which governs the decisions of courts of law; see c. 34. p. 478 A. It redresses <lb/>
            the disturbed balance of society, heals the diseases which injustice and wrong <lb/>
            have introduced into the body corporate, and so corresponds to medicine which <lb/>
            operates similarly upon the individual human body. Of this rhetoric, which <lb/>
            pretends to maintain the right and redress wrong, is the spurious and counter- <lb/>

            make of their own profession, or any body else what to make <lb/>
            of them. For in fact, if it were not the soul that had the <lb/>
            control of the body, but the latter were its own master, and <lb/>
            so cookery and medicine were not surveyed and distin- <lb/>
            guished by it, but the body itself were the judge, weighing <lb/>
            and estimating them by the gratifications that they procure <lb/>
            for it, the state of things described in the saying of Anaxagoras <lb/>
            would prevail far and wide, my dear Polus—for you under- <lb/>
            stand these things-every thing would be jumbled together <lb/>
            in a mass (there would be an universal chaos) and things <lb/>
            sanitary and wholesome and the cook's sauces and condiments <lb/>
            undistinguishable. You have heard now what I affirm rhe- <lb/>
            toric to be, the counterpart of cookery in the soul corre- <lb/>
            sponding to that in the body. Now perhaps I have done <lb/>
            rather an odd thing in expatiating at such length myself <lb/>
            when I refused to let youmake a long speech. How- <lb/>
            ever I deserve to be excused; for when I spoke in short <lb/>
            sentences you didn't understand me, nor could you make any <lb/>
            use of the answer I then gave you, but required a detailed <lb/>
            explanation. Now if I on my side don't know what to <lb/>
            make of any of your answers you may expatiate in your <note type="chapter"> 466 </note> <lb/>
            turn, but if I can make good use of it, let me do so : for that <lb/>
            is fair. And now if you can make any thing of this answer <lb/>
            of mine, there it is for you.</p>
          <p>Pol. What say you then ? Do you take rhetoric to be a <note type="margin"> c. 21 </note> <lb/>
            sort of flattery ?</p>
          <p>Soc. Nay I said a branch of flattery. Why, have you <lb/>
            no better memory at your age, Polus ? What will you do by <lb/>
            and by ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Then is it your opinion that good orators are <lb/>
            esteemed worthless in their cities as flatterers ?</p>
          <p>Soc. Is that a question you are asking, or the beginning <lb/>
            of a speech ?</p>
          <p>Pol. A question to be sure.</p>
          <p>Soc. Then I don't think they are esteemed at all.</p><pb n="32"/>
            
          <p>Pol. How not esteemed? Are they not all-powerful in <lb/>
            their cities ?</p>
          <p>Soc. No, if at least you mean that power is a good to its <lb/>
            possessor.</p>
          <p>Pol. Why of course I mean that.</p>
          <p>Soc. Then it seems to me that the orators have of all <lb/>
            citizens the least power.</p>
          <p>Pol. How? Don't they like tyrants put to death any <lb/>
            one they please, or strip of his property or banish from their <lb/>
            cities any one they think proper ?</p>
          <p>Soc. By the dog, Polus, I am really quite in doubt at <lb/>
            every word you say whether you are making an assertion <lb/>
            yourself and delivering your own opinion, or asking me a <lb/>
            question.</p>
          <p>Pol. Why I'm asking you to be sure.</p>
          <p>Soc. Very good, my friend : and then do you ask me <lb/>
            two questions at once ?</p>
          <p>Pol. How two ?</p>
          <p>Soc. Didn't you say just now something of this sort, that <lb/>
            the orators put any one they please to death, like the tyrants, <lb/>
            or rob of his money, or banish from their cities any one they <lb/>
            think proper ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes I did.</p>
          <p><note type="margin"> c. 22 </note> Soc. I tell you then that these questions of yours are <lb/>
            two, and I will give you an answer to both. For I maintain, <lb/>
            Polus, that the orators and the tyrants have the smallest <lb/>
            possible power in their cities, as I said just now; for they <lb/>
            don't do anything at all that they desire, so to speak : how- <lb/>
            ever I admit that they do anything that they think best.</p>
          <p>Pol. Well and isn't that great power ?</p>
          <p>Soc. No, at least according to what Polus says.</p>
          <p>Pol. I say no? I beg your pardon, I say yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. No by-indeed you don't, for you said that great <lb/>
            power is a good to its possessor.</p>
          <p>Pol. Well and so I do.</p>
          <p>Soc. Then do you think it a good for a man to do any- <lb/>
             <pb n="33"/>
            thing he thinks best, supposing he has no understanding ? <lb/>
            and do you call that great power?</p>
          <p>Pol. No not I.</p>
          <p>Soc. Then you must prove to me that the orators are <lb/>
            men of understanding, and that rhetoric is an art, and not a <note type="chapter"> 467 </note> <lb/>
            mere flattery, and so refute me. But if you leave me un- <lb/>
            refuted, your orators who do what they think proper in their <lb/>
            cities, and your tyrants, will find no advantage in that, if <lb/>
            indeed power is as you say a good, and doing what one <lb/>
            thinks fit without understanding you too admit to be an <lb/>
            evil. You do, don't you?</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes I do.</p>
          <p>Soc. Then how can orators or tyrants have great power <lb/>
            in their cities unless Socrates be forced by Polus to own that <lb/>
            they do what they desire ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Here's a fellow</p>
          <p>Soc. I say they don't do what they desire-There now, <lb/>
            refute me.</p>
          <p>Pol. Didn't you admit just before that they do what <lb/>
            they think best ?</p>
          <p>Soc. Well and so I do now.</p>
          <p>Pol. Why then they do what they desire.</p>
          <p>Soc. I say no.</p>
          <p>Pol. What ? whilst they do what they think fit ?</p>
          <p>Soc. Yes.</p>
          <p>Pol. This is abominable, Socrates, quite monstrous.</p>
          <p>Soc. Don't be abusive, most polite Polus, to address you <lb/>
            in your own style1 but if you have any question to put to <lb/>
            me prove that I am wrong, or if not answer yourself. <note type="footnote"> 1 Polus' ' own style' has been already partially exemplified at p. 448 c. <lb/>
            He was a disciple of Gorgias and had adopted the rhetorical figures introduced <lb/>
            by the other into prose composition, which he disfigured by the lavish excess to <lb/>
            which he indulged in them. See further on this subject, Journal of Classical <lb/>
            and Sacred Philology, No. vii. pp. 69—72, where these figures are classified <lb/>
            and illustrated. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦλψ̑στεΠω̑λει</foreign>s referred by Plato to the class <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρίσωσις</foreign>,as <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Pol. Well I will answer, to find out what really you do <lb/>
            mean.</p>
          <p><note type="margin"> c. 23 </note> Soc. Is it your opinion then that people in doing any <lb/>
            thing on any occasion desire simply what they do [i.e. the <lb/>
            means to their end] or that which is the object of their doing <lb/>
            what they do ? As in the case of patients for instance who <lb/>
            take medicine prescribed by the physicians, think you they <lb/>
            desire merely what they do, to swallow the medicine and <lb/>
            suffer pain, or that, health to wit, which is the object of <lb/>
            their taking it ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Plainly health, which is the object in taking it.</p>
          <p>Soc. And so with foreign merchants or those that are <lb/>
            engaged in any other branch of trade, what they desire is not <lb/>
            what they are habitually doing; for who desires to incur all <lb/>
            the risk and trouble of a voyage ? what they desire I pre- <lb/>
            slime is that which is the object of their voyage, wealth:for <lb/>
            it is for wealth they undertake it.</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes certainly.</p>
          <p>Soc. And isn't the same true in all other cases ? If a <lb/>
            man do any thing for an object, he doesn't desire that which <lb/>
            he does, but that which was his object in doing it ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. Well then, is there any thing existing that is not <lb/>
            either good or bad or indifferent, neither good nor bad ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Most decidedly, nothing, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Soc. Well do you call wisdom and health and wealth <lb/>
            and every thing else of that sort good, and the opposites <lb/>
            of these bad ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes I do.</p>
          <p>Soc. And by things neither good nor bad do you mean <note type="chapter"> 468 </note> <lb/>
            things like these, such as sometimes partake of the nature of <lb/>
            the good and sometimes of the bad and sometimes of neither, <lb/>
            as sitting for example and walking and running and sailing, <note type="footnote"> <foreign xml:lang="grc">σαμένουι</foreign>s afterwards described as <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἴσαλέγειν</foreign>.It would however usually be <lb/>

             <pb n="35"/>
            or again things such as stones or sticks or any thing else of <lb/>
            that sort ? These are what you mean, are they not ? or is <lb/>
            there any thing else to which you give the name of neither <lb/>
            good nor bad ?</p>
          <p>Pol. No, these are what I mean.</p>
          <p>Soc. Do people then do these indifferent (intermediate) <lb/>
            things when they do them for the sake of the good, or the <lb/>
            good for the sake of the indifferent ?</p>
          <p>Pol. The indifferent for the sake of the good to be sure.</p>
          <p>Soc. Consequently it is in pursuit of good that we either <lb/>
            walk, when we do walk, because we think it better for us, or, <lb/>
            the contrary, stand still, when we do stand, with the same <lb/>
            object, the good, don't we ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. And so likewise don't we put a man to death if we <lb/>
            ever do such a thing, or banish him, or deprive him of his <lb/>
            property, because we think it is better for us to do it than <lb/>
            not ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes no doubt.</p>
          <p>Soc. So then it is for the sake of what is good that <lb/>
            people do all these things that do them.</p>
          <p>Pol. I allow it.</p>
          <p>Soc. Well but didn't we admit that when we do things <note type="margin"> c. 24 </note> <lb/>
            with an object in view we don't desire those things, but that <lb/>
            which is the object of our doing them ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Quite so.</p>
          <p>Soc. Then we don't desire to massacre people or expel <lb/>
            them from our cities or rob them of their money merely in <lb/>
            the abstract, but if these things are advantageous we desire <lb/>
            to do them, but if mischievous we do not. For we desire what <lb/>
            is good, as you allow; but what is neither good nor bad we <lb/>
            do not desire, nor what is bad, do we ? Do you think what I <lb/>
            say is true, Polus, or not? [a pause]. Why don't you <lb/>
            answer ?</p>
          <p>Pol. (Sulkily.) True.</p>
          <p>Soc. Well then admitting this, if a man puts any one to <note type="footnote"> 32 <lb/>
            a </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="36"/>
            death or expels him from the city or strips him of his pro- <lb/>
            perty, whether he be tyrant or orator that does it, because he <lb/>
            thinks it is better for him, when it is really worse, he I pre- <lb/>
            sume does what he thinks fit, doesn't he ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. But does he also do what he desires, supposing <lb/>
            these things to be bad for him ?-Why don't you answer ?</p>
          <p>Pol. No, I don't think he does what he desires.</p>
          <p>Soc. Can it be said then that such an one has great <lb/>
            power in that city, if great power means something good <lb/>
            according to your admission ?</p>
          <p>Pol. It can not.</p>
          <p>Soc. I spoke the truth then in saying that it is possible <lb/>
            for a man to do what he pleases in a city and yet not to have <lb/>
            great power nor to do what he desires.</p>
          <p>Pol. Just as if you, Socrates, would not choose to'have <lb/>
            the liberty of doing what you please in your city rather than <lb/>
            not, and don't envy a man when you see one that has either <lb/>
            put some one to death or robbed or imprisoned him because <lb/>
            he thought proper to do so.</p>
          <p>Soc. Do you mean justly or unjustly?</p>
          <p><note type="chapter"> 469 </note> Pol. Whichever it be, is it not enviable either way ?</p>
          <p>Soc. Hush, hush, Pol as.</p>
          <p>Pol. Why so ?</p>
          <p>Soc. Because we musn't envy the unenviable nor the <lb/>
            miserable, but pity them.</p>
          <p>Pol. What ? Is this your opinion of the condition of <lb/>
            the men that I speak of ?</p>
          <p>Soc. How can it be otherwise ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Then do you think a man who puts any one he <lb/>
            pleases to death if be does it justly is wretched and an object <lb/>
            of pity?</p>
          <p>Soc. No I don't; but not enviable either.</p>
          <p>Pol. Didn't you say just now that he was wretched ?</p>
          <p>Soc. Nay I said if he did it unjustly, my friend, and an <lb/>
            object of pity into the bargain ; but if justly, unenviable.</p><pb n="37"/>
            
          <p>Pol. Oh no doubt a man who is put to death unjustly is <lb/>
            pitiable and wretched.</p>
          <p>Soc. Less so than the author of his death, Polus, and <lb/>
            less so than one who deserves to die.</p>
          <p>Pol. In what way pray, Socrates ?</p>
          <p>Soc. In this, that to do wrong is the greatest of all <lb/>
            evils.</p>
          <p>Pol. What? this. the greatest? is not to suffer wrong a <lb/>
            greater ?</p>
          <p>Soc. No by no means.</p>
          <p>Pol. Would you prefer then suffering wrong to doing it?</p>
          <p>Soc. I should prefer neither for my own part; but if I <lb/>
            were obliged either to do wrong or to suffer it I should choose <lb/>
            suffering rather than doing it.</p>
          <p>Pol. Then I suppose you wouldn't accept despotic <lb/>
            power ?</p>
          <p>Soc. No, if you mean by despotic power the same as <lb/>
            I do.</p>
          <p>Pol. Well I mean what I said just now, to have the <lb/>
            liberty of doing anything one pleases in one's city, the power <lb/>
            of death or banishment or, in short, doing anything according <lb/>
            to one's own will and pleasure.</p>
          <p>Soc. My worthy friend, let me tell you something and <note type="margin"> c. 25 </note> <lb/>
            then when it comes to your turn to speak you may criticise it. <lb/>
            If in a crowded market1 I were to take a dagger under my <lb/>
            arm, and whisper to you, Polus, I have just come into posses- <lb/>
            sion of quite a despotic power, perfectly amazing; for if I think <lb/>
            fit that any one of those men that you see there should die <lb/>
            this instant, he'll be a dead man, any one of them I please; <lb/>
            or if it seems to me that any one of them ought to have his <lb/>
            head broken, it'll be broken on the spot, or to have his <lb/>
            coat torn in two, it'll be done: so great is my power in this <lb/>
            city- If I say on finding you incredulous I were to show you <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνἀγόραπληθούσηι</foreign>s not used here as a note of time to signify the fore- <lb/>
            noon ; but, as in Thuc. VIII. 92, it denotes simply the crowded state of the <lb/>
            market-place. See Arnold and Poppo's Notes. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="38"/>
            my dagger, you would say probably when you saw it, why, <lb/>
            Socrates, at this rate every body would have great power, for <lb/>
            in this fashion any house too you please might be set on <lb/>
            fire, aye and the Athenian docks as well and their men of <lb/>
            war and all their other vessels public as well as private. <lb/>
            But surely this is not the meaning of having great power, to <lb/>
            do anything one pleases. Do you think it is ?</p>
          <p>Pol. No certainly not, in that way.</p>
          <p><note type="chapter"> 470 </note> Soc. Can you tell me then why you disapprove of power <lb/>
            of this kind ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes I can.</p>
          <p>Soc. Why is it then ? say.</p>
          <p>Pol. Because punishment is the inevitable consequence <lb/>
            of doing such things as that.</p>
          <p>Soc. And is not punishment a bad thing ?</p>
          <p>Pol. To be sure it is.</p>
          <p>Soc. And so, my fine fellow, you have come round again <lb/>
            to the opinion that great power is a good provided the doing <lb/>
            what one pleases be accompanied by some advantage in do- <lb/>
            ing it, and that this alone really is great power; otherwise it <lb/>
            is a bad thing and mere weakness. And next let us consider <lb/>
            this point. We admit, don't we, that it is sometimes better <lb/>
            to do such things as we were just speaking of, to put men to <lb/>
            death or banish them or deprive them of their property, and <lb/>
            sometimes not ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes certainly.</p>
          <p>Soc. Well then, it seems, you and I agree in admitting <lb/>
            this.</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. Then when do you say it is better to do them ? <lb/>
            Tell me where you draw your line ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Nay, Socrates, do you answer this same question <lb/>
            yourself.</p>
          <p>Soc. Well then I say, Polus, if you prefer hearing it from <lb/>
            me, that it is better to do these things when they are done <lb/>
            justly, and when unjustly then worse.</p><pb n="39"/>
            
          <p>Pol. Very hard' indeed it is to refute you, Socrates. <note type="margin"> c. 2G </note> <lb/>
            W hy, couldn't any child prove you to be in the wrong ?</p>
          <p>Soc. Then I shall be very much obliged to the child, <lb/>
            and equally so to you, if you refute me and deliver me from <lb/>
            my absurdity. Pray now don't shrink from the trouble of <lb/>
            doing a friend a kindness, but refute me.</p>
          <p>Pol. Why really, Socrates, there is no occasion to go <lb/>
            back to stories of old times to refute you; for the events of <lb/>
            only the other day2 are quite enough to prove you. in the <lb/>
            wrong and to show that many wrong doers are happy.</p>
          <p>Soc. What are they ?</p>
          <p>Pol. You see I presume that the famous Archelaus son <lb/>
            of Perdiccas is king of Macedonia ?</p>
          <p>Soc. Well if I don't, I hear of it at any rate.</p>
          <p>Pol.Do you take him then to be happy or wretched ?</p>
          <p>Soc. I don't know, Polus, for I haven't the honour of his <lb/>
            acquaintance.</p>
          <p>Pol. How's that ? Do you mean to say you could dis- <note type="footnote"> 1 Polus' irony is here directed against the opinion which prevailed amongst <lb/>
            the friends of Socrates that it was impossible to refute him. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 ‘Only the other day' really means eight years ago. The dramatic date <lb/>
            of the dialogue is fixed by the passage 473 E, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πέρυσιβουλεύεινλαχὼνΚ</foreign>.T.<foreign xml:lang="grc">λ</foreign>. in <lb/>
            the year 405 B.C., and Archelaus usurped the throne of Macedonia in 413. Stall- <lb/>
            baum's arguments (Introd. pp. 56—72) are quite conclusive in favour of the <lb/>
            year 405, and against an earlier date. He is also very fairly successful in <lb/>
            explaining alway all the historical references, such as the present passage, <lb/>
            which seem to clash with this supposition. But it may reasonably be doubted <lb/>
            whether it is worth while to bestow any great amount of pains and labour upon <lb/>
            such an attempt. All great writers of fiction such as Shakespeare and Walter <lb/>
            Scott allow themselves great licence in this particular; and I strongly suspect <lb/>
            that Plato was no more careful to avoid such lapses than his literary brethren. <lb/>
            This seems to me to be proved by the great difficulty which is almost invariably <lb/>
            found in fixing the dramatic date of any of his dialogues, arising partly from <lb/>
            the numerous inconsistencies and historical inaccuracies which we seldom fail to <lb/>
            find in them. These most easily escape detection on the part of the author <lb/>
            and the reader, both of them having their attention occupied with more <lb/>
            important matters; a fact which seems to show how slight and excusable such <lb/>
            blemishes are in a work of fiction ; at all events, how little they interfere with <lb/>
            the real interest of this kind of composition. </note> <lb/>

            cover it by making his acquaintance ? Dont you know with- <lb/>
            out that at once (or, instinctively, Heind.) that he is happy ?</p>
          <p>Soc. No by my faith I don't.</p>
          <p>Pol. Then it's plain, Socrates, that you will say that <lb/>
            you don't know that the great king is happy either.</p>
          <p>Soc. And if I do I shall say the truth : for I don't know <lb/>
            what is his condition in respect of his mental cultivation and <lb/>
            moral character 1.</p>
          <p>Pol. How then ? does happiness consist solely in this ?</p>
          <p>Soc. Yes according to my view, Polus : for an honest <lb/>
            man or woman I say is happy, and one that is unjust and <lb/>
            wicked miserable.</p>
          <p><note type="chapter"> 471 </note> Pol. Then according to your account the great Archelaus <lb/>
            is miserable ?</p>
          <p>Soc. Yes, my friend, if he is unjust.</p>
          <p>Pol. Why of course, how can he be otherwise ? He had <lb/>
            no claim whatever to the throne which he now occupies, <lb/>
            being the son of a woman (Simiche) who was the slave of <lb/>
            Perdiccas' brother Alcetas, and in strict justice was Alcetas' <lb/>
            slave; and if he had desired to do what was right he would <lb/>
            have been the slave of Alcetas and happy according to your <lb/>
            account. But now it is really amazing how miserable he has <lb/>
            become, for he has done the most enormous wrong. First of <lb/>
            all he invited this very same master and uncle of his to his <lb/>
            court as if he meant to restore to him the dominions of which <lb/>
            Perdiccas robbed him, and after entertaining him and his son <lb/>
            Alexander, his own cousin, about the same age as himself, <lb/>
            and making them drunk, he stowed them away in a carriage, <lb/>
            carried them off by night, murdered them both and made <lb/>
            away with them. And after all this wickedness he never <lb/>
            discovered that he had made himself the most miserable <lb/>

            -boil, of about seven years old, to whom the throne came by <lb/>
            right, and restoring to him his kingdom, but shortly after he <lb/>
            threw him into a well and drowned him, and then told his <lb/>
            mother Cleopatra that he had tumbled in as he was running <lb/>
            after a goose and so come by his death. Doubtless therefore <lb/>
            now as he is the greatest criminal in Macedonia he is the <lb/>
            most miserable of all the Macedonians, and not the happiest, <lb/>
            and I dare say there are a good many people in Athens, with <lb/>
            yourself at their head, who would rather take the place of <lb/>
            any other Macedonian whatever than that of Archelaus.</p>
          <p>Soc. I complimented you before at the beginning of our <note type="margin"> c. 27</note> <lb/>
            conversation, Polus, upon your being as it seemed to me so <lb/>
            admirably instructed in the art of rhetoric, though at the <lb/>
            same time I thought you had somewhat neglected the dia- <lb/>
            logue. And so now, this is the famous argument, is it, with <lb/>
            which any child could refute me? and this is the sort of talk <lb/>
            by which in your opinion I now stand convicted when I <lb/>
            assert that the wrong doer is not happy ? How can that be, <lb/>
            my good friend \ And yet I don't admit a single word <lb/>
            you say.</p>
          <p>Pol. No because you won't; for I'm sure you think as <lb/>
            I say.</p>
          <p>Soc. My dear creature, that's because you try to refute me <lb/>
            in rhetorical fashion, as they fancy they do in the law courts. <lb/>
            For there indeed the one party is supposed to refute the other <lb/>
            when he brings forward a number of respectable witnesses in <lb/>
            support of any statements he happens to make, whilst the <lb/>
            opponent produces only a single one or none at all. But refu- <lb/>
            tation of this kind is absolutely worthless for the purpose of <note type="chapter"> 472 </note> <lb/>
            ascertaining the truth: for it may even happen sometimes <lb/>
            that a man may be overborne by the false witness of numbers <lb/>
            and apparent respectability. And now if you want to bring <lb/>
            forward witnesses to prove that I am wrong on the points you <lb/>
            speak of, you will find nearly every body, Athenians and <lb/>
            foreigners, agree with you. You may have for witnesses <lb/>
            Nicias, if you please, son of Niceratus with his brothers, <lb/>
             <pb n="42"/>
            whose tripods arc standing in a row in the Dionysium, or if <lb/>
            you please Aristocrates soil of Scellias, the donor of that <lb/>
            splendid offering again at Delphi 1 or if you like, the whole <lb/>
            house of Pericles or any other family you choose to select <lb/>
            out of those of this place. But I, alone as I stand here, <lb/>
            refuse to admit it: for you can't convince me, but you try by <lb/>
            bringing forward a number of false witnesses against me to <lb/>
            dispossess me of my substance2 and of the truth. But for <lb/>
            my part, if I don't produce yourself for one as a witness in <lb/>
            confirmation of what I say, I think I have effected nothing <lb/>
            of the least importance in advancing the object of our discus- <lb/>
            sion ; nor you either I think, unless I singly and alone bear <lb/>
            witness in your favour, and you leave all the rest of those <lb/>
            people entirely out of the question. This then is one kind of <lb/>
            proof, as you and a good many others besides you imagine it <lb/>
            to be; and there is also another which I on my side deem to <lb/>
            be such. Let us then compare them together and see if we <lb/>
            shall find any difference between them. For in truth the <note type="footnote"> 1 This is one of the passages which has been supposed to disagree with the <lb/>
            date 405 B.C. assigned as the dramatic date of the dialogue: and even Schleier. <lb/>
            macher who adopts it conceives that Nicias and Aristocrates, who died in 413 <lb/>
            and 406 respectively, are spoken of as living witnesses, and that this is there- <lb/>
            fore an anachronism. I have already expressed my belief that Plato thought <lb/>
            little of historical consistency in writing his dialogues; but in the present <lb/>
            instance we are not driven to any such supposition. Ast has pointed out that <lb/>
            it is the evidence of the monuments that is here appealed to. They testify <lb/>
            to the wealth and splendour of those who dedicated them, and also to their <lb/>
            opinion upon the advantages of such things by the desire they evince for the <lb/>
            perpetuation of the memory of them. They are " the bricks" in short that be <lb/>
            alive to this day to testify" to their regard for worldly advantages. In fact, <lb/>
            unless this were Plato's meaning, there could be no conceivable reason for men- <lb/>
            tioning their offerings at all. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This is what I may call the ' received' translation of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ούσία</foreign> which of <lb/>
            course has a double meaning 'property' and 'reality' or real truth. It is open <lb/>
            however to the objection of being too technical in its philosophical sense. The <lb/>
            Aristotelian 'substance' was unknown to the Platonic terminology. I believe <lb/>
            the lawyers have a word 'realty' or 'realties,' used as an alternative for real <lb/>
            property. If so, this I think would render the original better, as coming much <lb/>
            nearer to the Platonic conception of <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐσἰα</foreign>; though from its technicality I have <lb/>

            subject we are debating is one of by no means slight import- <lb/>
            ance, nay it is one might almost say that on which to know <lb/>
            is noblest and not to know most disgraceful: for what it all <lb/>
            amounts to is, either to know or to be ignorant who is a <lb/>
            happy man and who is not. First of all for instance, to take <lb/>
            the particular point we are now discussing, you conceive it <lb/>
            possible for a man to be happy in wrong doing and in wicked- <lb/>
            ness, supposing that you think Archelaus to be a wicked <lb/>
            man and yet happy. Are we not to suppose that this is <lb/>
            your opinion ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes certainly.</p>
          <p>Soc. And I say it's impossible. Here is one point on <note type="margin"> c. 28 </note> <lb/>
            which we differ. So far so good. But will then a man be <lb/>
            happy in wrong doing if he be overtaken by justice and <lb/>
            punishment ?</p>
          <p>Pol. No, by no means; in that case he would be most <lb/>
            miserable.</p>
          <p>Soc. But if the wrong doer chance to escape justice, <lb/>
            according to your account he will be happy ?</p>
          <p>Pol. That is my view.</p>
          <p>Soc. And in my opinion, Polus,. the wrong doer and <lb/>
            the wicked man is in every case miserable; more miser- <lb/>
            able however if he escape justice and evade punish- <lb/>
            ment for his iniquity, but less miserable if he pay the <lb/>
            penalty of his crimes, and be duly punished by Gods and <lb/>
            men.</p>
          <p>Pol. A strange paradox this, Socrates, that you under- <note type="chapter"> 473 </note> <lb/>
            take to maintain.</p>
          <p>Soc. Aye and I will try to make you too maintain the <lb/>
            same, my friend, for as a friend I regard you. So now, the <lb/>
            points on which we differ are these. Look at them yourself. <lb/>
            I told you I believe before that doing wrong is worse than <lb/>
            suffering it.</p>
          <p>Pol. No doubt you did.</p>
          <p>Soc. You on the contrary thought suffering it worse.</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes.</p><pb n="44"/>
            
          <p>Soc. And I said that the wrong doers are miserable, and <lb/>
            you refuted me.</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes, egad, that I did.</p>
          <p>Soc. At least in your own opinion, Polus.</p>
          <p>Pol. And my opinion is right I should rather think.</p>
          <p>Soc. But you said on the other hand that the wicked are <lb/>
            happy, provided they escape justice.</p>
          <p>Pol. No doubt of it.</p>
          <p>Soc. And I say they are most miserable, and those that <lb/>
            are brought to justice less so. Will you refute that too?</p>
          <p>Pol. Why that's still harder to refute than the other, <lb/>
            Socrates.</p>
          <p>Soc. Not only so, Polus, but impossible; for the truth <lb/>
            can never be refuted.</p>
          <p>Pol. How say you ? If a man be detected in a criminal <lb/>
            design of making himself absolute, and thereupon be put to <lb/>
            the torture or mutilated or have his eyes burnt out; or, after <lb/>
            having been himself subjected to every possible variety of the <lb/>
            severest torments and been forced to look on whilst his own <lb/>
            children and wife endured the like, then last of all be cruci- <lb/>
            fied or burnt to death in a coat of pitch- will he be a happier <lb/>
            man than if he were to escape and make himself tyrant, and <lb/>
            pass his life as supreme ruler in his city in doing whatsoever <lb/>
            he pleases, an object of envy and congratulation to his own <lb/>
            citizens and all foreigners to boot? Is this what you say it <lb/>
            is impossible to refute?</p>
          <p><note type="chapter"> c. 29 </note> Soc. Now you are trying to scare me with bugbears, my <lb/>
            brave Polus, instead of refuting me; just now you were <lb/>
            citing witnesses against me. However never mind that, but <lb/>
            just refresh my memory a little: "in a criminal design upon <lb/>
            the tyranny," you said?</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes I did.</p>
          <p>Soc. Then neither of them will ever be happier than <lb/>
            the other, neither he that has unjustly compassed the tyranny <lb/>
            nor he that is punished for his misdeeds: for of two miserable <lb/>
            men neither can be said to be happier: still the more <lb/>
             <pb n="45"/>
            miserable is he that remains undiscovered and secures him- <lb/>
            self on the throne. [Polus smiles.] What does that mean, <lb/>
            Polus? Are you laughing? Here's another new kind of <lb/>
            refutation; when an assertion is made to refute it by grin- <lb/>
            ning instead of argument 1.</p>
          <p>Pol. Don't you think, Socrates, you are confuted already, <lb/>
            when you assert such things as no human being would main- <lb/>
            tain ? Only ask any one of the company there.</p>
          <p>Soc. Polus, I am not one of your public men ; in fact <lb/>
            only last year when I was elected member of the Council, <lb/>
            and, my tribe having the Presidency, it became my duty <lb/>
            to put a question to the vote, I made myself ridiculous by <lb/>
            not knowing how to do it2. So don't ask me again this time <note type="chapter"> 474 </note> <note type="footnote"> 1 '' And coxcombs vanquish Berkeley with a grin."—Pope </note><note type="footnote"/><note type="footnote"> 2 This is the passage by which the dramatic date of the dialogue is deter- <lb/>

            used hand the matter over to me in my turn, and try the sort <lb/>
            of proof that I think ought to be employed. For I know <lb/>

            that is the man himself with whom I am arguing, the many <lb/>

            to take, whilst to the multitude I have nothing whatever to <lb/>
            say. See then whether you will consent to submit to be <lb/>
            refuted in your turn by answering my questions. For I <lb/>
            think, you know, that you and I and every one else believes <lb/>
            doing wrong to be worse than suffering it, and escaping <lb/>
            punishment for one's transgressions worse than enduring it.</p>
          <p>Pol. And I, that neither I nor anyone else in the world <lb/>
            believes it. For would you rather suffer wrong than do it ?</p>
          <p>Soc. Yes, and so would you and every body else.</p>
          <p>Pol. You are quite wrong; on the contrary neither I nor <lb/>
            you nor any one else.</p>
          <p>Soc. Then will you answer?</p>
          <p>Pol. By all means, for in fact I am quite curious to know <lb/>
            what you can possibly have to say.</p>
          <p>Soc. Then tell me that you may know, just as if I was <lb/>

          <p>Pol. Suffering it to be sure.</p>
          <p>Soc. But what say you to 'fouler 1?' Which of the two <lb/>

            bad and foul are not the same things.</p>
          <p>Pol. Certainly not.</p>
          <p>Soc. But what of this? All fair things, as bodies and <lb/>
            colours and figures and sounds and pursuits-is it with refer- <lb/>
            ence to no standard at all that you call them fair every time <lb/>
            you use the word? for instance first, when you apply the <lb/>
            term fair to fair bodies is it not either in respect of their <lb/>
            use, with reference, that is, to the purpose which any of <lb/>
            them may be made to serve ; or in respect of some kind of <lb/>
            pleasure, when they give delight to those that look at them <lb/>
            in the act of contemplation ? Have you any account to give <lb/>
            beyond this of beauty of body ?</p>
          <p>Pol. None.</p>
          <p>Soc. And so with everything else in the same way, <lb/>
            figures and colours, is it in virtue of some pleasure or ad- <lb/>
            vantage or both that you term them fair?</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes it is.</p>
          <p>Soc. And with sounds too and every thing in music, is <lb/>
            it not just the same ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. And moreover in all that belongs to laws and habits <lb/>
            of life, their beauty I presume is to be found nowhere beyond <lb/>
            these limits, that is to say, either the utility or the pleasure <lb/>
            that is in them, or both.</p>
          <p>Pol. No, I think not.</p>
          <p>Soc. And so again with the beauty of studies is it not <note type="chapter"> 475 </note> <lb/>
            the same ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes no doubt; and this time, Socrates, I do really <note type="footnote"> changing them: and hence we are reduced to the alternative of either marring <lb/>
            the argument or adopting some unfamiliar terms to represent two of the corn. <lb/>

            like your definition, when you define what is fair by pleasure <lb/>
            and good.</p>
          <p>Soc. And may I in the same way define what is foul by <lb/>
            the opposites, pain and evil ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Of course you may.</p>
          <p>Soc. So then when of two fair things one is fairer, it is <lb/>
            so because it surpasses in one of these two things or both of <lb/>
            them, either in pleasure or utility or both.</p>
          <p>Pol. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Soc. And when again of two foul things the one is fouler, <lb/>
            it will be so by the excess either of pain or mischief. Is not <lb/>
            that a necessary consequence ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. Come then, what was said just now about doing <lb/>
            and suffering wrong ? didn't you say that suffering wrong is <lb/>
            worse, but doing it fouler ?</p>
          <p>Pol. I did.</p>
          <p>Soc. Well then if doing wrong is fouler than suffering <lb/>
            it, it is either more painful, and fouler by excess of pain, or <lb/>
            of mischief or both ? Does not this also necessarily follow ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Of course it does.</p>
          <p><note type="margin"> c. 31 </note> Soc. First of all then let us consider whether doing <lb/>
            wrong exceeds suffering it in pain, whether, that is, those <lb/>
            that do wrong feel more pain than those that suffer it ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Oh no, Socrates, not that.</p>
          <p>Soc. So then it is not in pain that it exceeds.</p>
          <p>Pol. Certainly not.</p>
          <p>Soc. And accordingly if not in pain, it cannot now1 ex- <lb/>
            ceed in both.</p>
          <p>Pol. It appears not.</p>
          <p>Soc. It only remains then (that it exceed) in the other.</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. In mischief. <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ετι</foreign>, ' any longer, after this, as it might have done if this had not been <lb/>
            the case.' Corresponding to <foreign xml:lang="grc">η̑δηι</foreign>n affirmative sentences. </note> <pb n="49"/>
            </p>
          <p>Pol. It seems so.</p>
          <p>Soc. So it is because it exceeds in mischief that doing <lb/>
            wrong is worse than suffering it.</p>
          <p>Pol. Plainly so.</p>
          <p>Soc. Is it not then admitted by the mass of mankind, as <lb/>
            it was in fact by yourself a little while ago, that doing wrong <lb/>
            is fouler than suffering it ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. And now it turns out to be worse.</p>
          <p>Pol. It seems so.</p>
          <p>Soc. Would you then prefer the greater evil and the <lb/>
            greater deformity to that which is less? Don't hesitate to <lb/>
            reply, Polus, it will do you no harm, but bravely submit <lb/>
            yourself to the argument as to a physician, and answer yes <lb/>
            or no to my question.</p>
          <p>Pol. Well I should not prefer it, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Soc. And would any one else in the world?</p>
          <p>Pol. No I think not, as you put the case now.</p>
          <p>Soc. Then I spoke the truth in saying that neither you <lb/>
            nor I nor any one else in the world would prefer doing to <lb/>
            suffering wrong ; because it's worse.</p>
          <p>Pol. So it appears.</p>
          <p>Soc. You see then, Polus, that when the one mode of <lb/>
            proof is brought into comparison with the other, there is no <lb/>
            resemblance between them; but you have the assent of every <lb/>
            one else except myself, whereas I am satisfied with your own <lb/>
            assent and your own evidence single and alone, and I take <note type="chapter"> 476 </note> <lb/>
            only your own vote and pay no sort of attention to the rest. <lb/>
            And so let this be considered settled between us. And next <lb/>
            let us examine the second question on which we differed; <lb/>
            whether, namely, for a guilty man to be brought to justice is <lb/>
            the greatest of all evils as you thought, or to escape it is a <lb/>
            greater as was my opinion. Let us consider it thus. Do <lb/>
            you call being brought to justice and being justly chastised <lb/>
            for wrong doing the same thing ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes I do. <note type="footnote"> 4 </note> <pb n="50"/>
            </p>
          <p>Soc. Can you deny that all just things are fair, in so far <lb/>
            as they arc just? Now consider well before you speak.</p>
          <p>Pol. Well I do think so, Socrates.</p>
          <p><note type="margin"> c. 32 </note> Soc. Then look at this again. When any one does an <lb/>
            act, is it necessary that there should be a something acted <lb/>
            upon by this agent?</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes I think so.</p>
          <p>Soc. And does that something suffer exactly what the <lb/>
            agent does ? and. receive an impression of the same kind as <lb/>
            the action of the agent? To explain my meaning by an <lb/>
            example-when any one strikes a blow, something must <lb/>
            necessarily be struck ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Just so.</p>
          <p>Soc. And if the striker strikes hard or quick, the <lb/>
            object struck is struck in the same way ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. Consequently the effect is of the same kind in the <lb/>
            object struck as is the action in the striking agent?</p>
          <p>Pol. To be sure.</p>
          <p>Soc. Or again, when a man burns, something must of <lb/>
            necessity be burnt ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Of course.</p>
          <p>Soc. And if he burns severely or painfully, the object <lb/>
            burnt must be burnt in the same way as the burning agent <lb/>
            burns ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes certainly.</p>
          <p>Soc. And so when a man cuts, the same rule applies, <lb/>
            that is to say something is cut ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. And if the cut is large or deep or painful, the cut <lb/>
            produced in the object cut is precisely of the same kind as <lb/>
            the thing cutting cuts it?</p>
          <p>Pol. So it appears.</p>
          <p>Soc. Well then in a word, see if you admit universally <lb/>
            the rule I just stated : the effect in the patient is of exactly <lb/>
            the same kind as the action in the agent.</p><pb n="51"/>
            
          <p>Pol. Well I do.</p>
          <p>Soc. This then being admitted, is to be punished to <lb/>
            suffer something or to do it ?</p>
          <p>Pol. To suffer of course, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Soc. And that too by the hands of some agent ?</p>
          <p>Pol. No doubt of it, by the hands of him that inflicts <lb/>
            the punishment.</p>
          <p>Soc. But he that punishes aright punishes justly.</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. And in doing that does he do what is just ?</p>
          <p>Pol. What is just.</p>
          <p>Soc. And again one that atones for his crime by punish- <lb/>
            ment suffers what is just ?</p>
          <p>Pol. So it appears.</p>
          <p>Soc. And what is just I believe we have admitted to be <lb/>
            fair?</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes certainly.</p>
          <p>Soc. Consequently of these two the one does what is <lb/>
            fair, and the other, the man who is punished, suffers it.</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. And so if fair then good, for that is either pleasant <note type="margin"> c. 33 </note> <lb/>
            or useful1. <note type="chapter"> 477 </note> </p>
          <p>Pol. Of course.</p>
          <p>Soc. So then one who is punished for his sins suffers <lb/>
            what is good ?</p>
          <p>Pol. It seems so.</p>
          <p>Soc. Then he receives a benefit ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. Is it that kind of benefit which I suspect ? namely <lb/>
            that his soul is improved if he is justly punished.</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes probably.</p>
          <p>Soc. Then is one that is brought to justice relieved from <lb/>
            vice of soul ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes. <note type="footnote"> 1 By the definition, c. 30, 474, D, E. </note> <note type="footnote"> 4-2 </note> <pb n="52"/>
            </p>
          <p>Soc. And is not that the greatest of all evils that he <lb/>
            is relieved from ? Look at it in this way. In a man's <lb/>
            pecuniary condition do you discern any other evil than <lb/>
            poverty ?</p>
          <p>Pol. No, only poverty.</p>
          <p>Soc. Or again in his bodily condition (constitution)? <lb/>
            would you not say the evil is weakness and disease and <lb/>
            ugliness and such like?</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes I should.</p>
          <p>Soc. And so in soul don't you believe that there is some <lb/>
            inherent vice ?</p>
          <p>Pol. No doubt of it.</p>
          <p>Soc. And don't you call this injustice and ignorance and <lb/>
            cowardice and so forth ?</p>
          <p>Pol. To be sure.</p>
          <p>Soc. So then in mind body and estate, these three, you <lb/>
            have pointed out three several vices, poverty disease in- <lb/>
            justice ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. Then which of these kinds of vice is the foulest ? <lb/>
            Is it not injustice, or in a word the vice of the soul?</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes by far.</p>
          <p>Soc. And if foulest then likewise worst ?</p>
          <p>Pol. How mean you by that, Socrates ?</p>
          <p>Soc. This. It follows from our previous conclusions that <lb/>
            what is most foul is so always by reason of its bringing with <lb/>
            it either the greatest pain or bane or both.</p>
          <p>Pol. Quite so.</p>
          <p>Soc. And now we have just admitted injustice and in <lb/>
            general vice of soul to be what is foulest ?</p>
          <p>Pol. We have no doubt.</p>
          <p>Soc. So then it is either most painful, or in other words <lb/>
            it is because it surpasses in painfulness that it is the foulest <lb/>
            of all of them (i. e. the beforementioned kinds of vice), or <lb/>
            banefulness or in both ways ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Necessarily.</p><pb n="53"/>
            
          <p>Soc. Is then to be unjust and licentious and cowardly <lb/>
            and ignorant more painful than poverty and sickness ?</p>
          <p>Pol. No I think not, Socrates, from what we have been <lb/>
            saying.</p>
          <p>Soc. Prodigious then must be the amount of baneful- <lb/>
            ness and amazing the evil by which the soul's vice exceeds <lb/>
            all the rest so as to make it the foulest of them all, since it <lb/>
            is not by pain, according to your account.</p>
          <p>Pol. So it appears.</p>
          <p>Soc. But further, where the excess consists in the highest <lb/>
            degree of banefulness that must I should think be the great- <lb/>
            est of all evils.</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. Injustice then and licentious indulgence and all the <lb/>
            rest of the soul's vices are the greatest of all evils.</p>
          <p>Pol. So it appears.</p>
          <p>Soc. What is the art then that delivers us from poverty? <note type="margin"> c. 34 </note> <lb/>
            Is it not that of trading ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. And what from disease? Is it not the art of medi- <lb/>
            cine ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Beyond all doubt.</p>
          <p>Soc. And what from wickedness and injustice? If you <note type="chapter"> 478 </note> <lb/>
            haven't an answer ready when the question is put in this <lb/>
            way, look at it thus: Whither and to whom do we carry <lb/>
            those whose bodies are diseased ?</p>
          <p>Pol. To the physicians, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Soc. And whither do we send the evil-doers and licen- <lb/>
            tious ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Before the judges do you mean ?</p>
          <p>Soc. To suffer for their crimes, isn't it ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. Is it not then by the application of a sort of justice <lb/>
            that those chastise who chastise aright ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Plainly.</p><pb n="54"/>
            
          <p>Soc. So then trading delivers us from poverty, medicine <lb/>
            from disease, and justice from licentiousness and wickedness.</p>
          <p>Pol. So it appears.</p>
          <p>Soc. Which then is fairest of these ?</p>
          <p>Pol. What do you mean ?</p>
          <p>Soc. Trading, medicine, justice.</p>
          <p>Pol. Justice, Socrates, is far superior.</p>
          <p>Soc. So then, again, if it is fairest it produces either the <lb/>
            greatest pleasure or profit or both? (recurring again to the <lb/>
            definition).</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. Well then, is medical treatment pleasant 1, and do <lb/>
            those who submit themselves to such treatment like it ?</p>
          <p>Pol. No I should think not.</p>
          <p>Soc. But it is beneficial, isn't it ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. Because the patient is rid of a great evil, and there- <lb/>
            fore it is well worth his while to undergo the pain and be well.</p>
          <p>Pol. Of course it is.</p>
          <p>Soc. Is this then the happiest condition for a man's <lb/>
            body to be in, to be cured by medical treatment, or never to <lb/>
            be ill at all ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Plainly never to be ill.</p>
          <p>Soc. For, it seems, this is not what we said happiness <lb/>
            consisted in, the deliverance from evil, but in never having <lb/>
            had it at all.</p>
          <p>Pol. It is so.</p>
          <p>Soc. Again. Of two persons that have something wrong <note type="footnote"> 1 On the analogy here assumed (and so frequently repeated in this and <lb/>
            other dialogues of Plato) between corrective justice and medicine, and the <lb/>

            suite il regarde le châtiment comme un bien pour le coupable, sans examiner si <lb/>
            le châtiment améliore toujours, et si la peine est a l'injustice ce que la brûlure <lb/>
            est a la plaie. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="55"/>
            in body or soul which is the more miserable ? The one who <lb/>
            puts himself into the physician's hands and so gets rid of <lb/>
            the mischief, or he who does not and retains it ?</p>
          <p>Pol. I should suppose the one who does not.</p>
          <p>Soc. And didn't we say that to be punished for one's <lb/>
            faults is a deliverance from the greatest evil, that is wicked- <lb/>
            ness ?</p>
          <p>Pol. We did.</p>
          <p>Soc. Because I suppose justice brings us under control <lb/>
            and makes us juster, and so becomes the art by which wicked- <lb/>
            ness is cured.</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. Happiest of all then is he who is free from vice in <lb/>
            his soul, seeing that we proved this to be the greatest of all <lb/>
            evils.</p>
          <p>Pol. Evidently.</p>
          <p>Soc. And in the second degree, I should suppose, he <lb/>
            who gets rid of it.</p>
          <p>Pol. It seems so.</p>
          <p>Soc. And he as we said is one who is admonished and <lb/>
            rebuked and punished.</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. Consequently one who retains injustice and is not <lb/>
            delivered from it leads the worst kind of life.</p>
          <p>Pol. So it appears.</p>
          <p>Soc. And is not he that man who in the commission of <lb/>
            the greatest crimes and the practice of the greatest iniquity <note type="chapter"> 479 </note> <lb/>
            has managed to escape reproof and correction and punish- <lb/>
            ment, as you say Archelaus has contrived to do, and the rest <lb/>
            of your tyrants and orators and potentates ?</p>
          <p>Pol. It seems so.</p>
          <p>Soc. Because, I should think, my excellent friend, what <note type="margin"> c. 35</note> <lb/>
            men of this sort have contrived to do for themselves is very <lb/>
            much the same as if a man afflicted with disease of the <lb/>
            worst kind were to contrive to escape giving satisfaction to <lb/>
            the physicians for the faults of his body, that is, undergoing <lb/>
             <pb n="56"/>
            medical treatment, dreading like a child the pain inflicted by <lb/>
            the cautery or the knife. Don't you, think so yourself?</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes I do.</p>
          <p>Soc. In ignorance it would seem of the great advantage <lb/>
            of health and soundness of body. For it appears from the <lb/>
            conclusions at which we have just arrived that the conduct <lb/>
            of those likewise who try to escape the penalty due to their <lb/>
            transgressions is very much of this kind, Polus; they discern <lb/>
            clearly enough its painfulness but are blind to its benefits, <lb/>
            and are not aware how much more miserable than an unsound <lb/>
            body1 it is to be associated with a soul that is not sound but <lb/>
            corrupt and unjust and unholy. And hence it is that they <lb/>
            strain every nerve to escape punishment and deliverance <lb/>
            from the direst evil, by providing themselves either with <lb/>
            money or friends or the means of making themselves the <lb/>
            most accomplished speakers. But if our conclusions are true, <lb/>
            Polus, do you perceive what follows from our argument ? or <lb/>
            would you like us to reckon it all up together ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes if you don't object.</p>
          <p>Soc. Is not one result then that injustice and wrong <lb/>
            doing is the worst of evils ?</p>
          <p>Pol. So it appears.</p>
          <p>Soc. And further it appeared that to suffer for one's <lb/>
            faults is a deliverance from this evil ?</p>
          <p>Pol. It seems so.</p>
          <p>Soc. And not to be punished for them is an abiding in <lb/>
            us of the evil ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. Wrong doing then is second of evils in degree; but <lb/>
            to do wrong and not suffer for it is the first and greatest of <lb/>
            them all.</p>
          <p>Pol. It seems so.</p>
          <p>Soc. Well, my friend, was not this the point in dispute <note type="footnote"> 1 I have here intentionally preserved the false comparison of the original. <lb/>
            Such blunders (exceptions we call them in the Classics) are as common in <lb/>

            between us, that you pronounced Archelaus, the greatest <lb/>
            of all criminals, happy because he enjoyed a complete immu- <lb/>
            nity from punishment for his crimes, whilst I thought on the <lb/>
            contrary that if any one, whether it be Archelaus or any one <lb/>
            else in the world, pay no penalty for the wrong that he does <lb/>
            he may justly be called preeminently miserable above all <lb/>
            other men ; and universally, that he that does wrong is more <lb/>
            miserable than he that suffers it, and he that escapes the <lb/>
            penalty for his transgressions than he that submits to it ? Is <lb/>
            not this what I said ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. Well then is it not now proved that what I said <lb/>
            was true ?</p>
          <p>Pol. It appears so.</p>
          <p>Soc. Very good. If then this is true, Pol us, what is the <note type="chapter"> 480 </note> <lb/>
            great use of rhetoric? For, you know, it follows from our <note type="margin"> c. 36</note> <lb/>
            present conclusions that a man should himself keep the <lb/>
            strictest watch over his own conduct to avoid all wrong, <lb/>
            seeing that thereby he will bring on himself great evil; <lb/>
            should he not ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes surely.</p>
          <p>Soc. But if he do commit a wrong, either himself or any <lb/>
            one else he cares for, he must go of his own accord to the <lb/>
            place where he may most speedily be punished for it, to the <lb/>
            judge as to his physician, striving earnestly that the disease <lb/>
            of his iniquity may not become inveterate and so make the <lb/>
            ulcer of his soul deep-seated and incurable. Or if not, what <lb/>
            are we to say, Polus, supposing our former admissions are to <lb/>
            stand ? Can the one be brought into harmony with the other <lb/>
            in any other way than this ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Why to be sure what else can we say, Socrates ?</p>
          <p>Soc. It follows then that for the purpose of a defence of <lb/>
            crime, whether the guilt be in oneself or one's parents or <lb/>
            friends or children or country, your rhetoric is of no use to us <lb/>
            at all, Polus, unless indeed one were to suppose the very <lb/>
            contrary, that it is a man's duty to accuse himself first of all, <lb/>
             <pb n="58"/>
            and in the next degree his relations or any one else of his <lb/>
            friends who may at any time be guilty of a wrong; and in- <lb/>
            stead of concealing the wrong to bring it to light, that the <lb/>
            offender may suffer the penalty and so be restored to health; <lb/>
            and again to force oneself and others not to flinch out of <lb/>
            cowardice, but submit bravely with closed eyes as it were to <lb/>
            a physician to be cut or burned, in the pursuit of what is good <lb/>
            and fair, not counting the pain; if his crimes have been <lb/>
            worthy of stripes submitting to the rod, or if of bonds to <lb/>
            imprisonment, or if of a fine to payment of the fine, or if <lb/>
            of exile to banishment, or of death to die; himself the first <lb/>
            to be his own accuser and of all his friends and relations as <lb/>
            well, and to this end employing his rhetoric that they may <lb/>
            all by the disclosure of their crimes be delivered from the <lb/>
            greatest of all evils, which is unrighteousness. Is this to be <lb/>
            our conclusion, or not, Polus ?</p>
          <p>Pol. A strange one, Socrates, it seems to me, but still <lb/>
            perhaps you do find it (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σος</foreign>) in agreement with what you <lb/>
            said before.</p>
          <p>Soc. Well then either the other must be disproved, or <lb/>
            this is the inevitable result.</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes, that is certainly so.</p>
          <p>Soc. And conversely again, if on the contrary one were <lb/>
            ever required to do a man a mischief, whether an enemy <lb/>
            or any one else-provided only the wrong be not inflicted <lb/>
            by the enemy on oneself, for that we must be very careful to <lb/>
            avoid1-but supposing the wrong to be done by him to <note type="footnote"> 1 This simple and innocent observation has been so strangely misinterpreted <lb/>
            by Stallbaum, that a word of explanation may not be out of place. His note <lb/>
            is "quoniam scilicet isto pacto necesse fuerit ut alter in judicium vocetur <lb/>
            (why? on the contrary, such a course would be inconsistent with the moral of <lb/>
            the entire passage, which is, that if you want to punish an enemy you must let <lb/>
            him alone and not bring him to justice), et justa poena afficiatur, quod beneficii <lb/>
            loco habendum fuerit." The plain meaning is that in punishing our enemies <lb/>
            we must take care not to punish ourselves. If we desire to inflict real damage <lb/>
            upon an enemy or offender, we must not send him before the tribunals of <lb/>
            justice or subject him to any penalty personal or pecuniary-these are instru- </note> <lb/>

            some one else, we should contrive by every means in our <lb/>
            power both by word and deed to secure him impunity and <note type="chapter"> 481 </note> <lb/>
            prevent him from appearing before the judge, or if he do, <lb/>
            we must devise means that the enemy may effect his escape <lb/>
            and not suffer punishment; but if he have stolen large sums <lb/>
            of gold we must contrive that he may not refund it, but keep <lb/>
            and spend it, on him and his, lawlessly and godlessly; or <lb/>
            if again he have committed crimes worthy of death, that <lb/>
            he may not die; if possible never, but be immortal in his <lb/>
            wickedness, or if not, that he may prolong his life to the <lb/>
            utmost being such as he is. Such are the objects as it seems <lb/>
            to me, Polus, for which rhetoric is serviceable, for to one <lb/>
            who does not intend to do wrong the use of it does not seem <lb/>
            to me particularly great-if indeed there be any use in it at <lb/>
            all-for to be sure in our preceding discourse it no where <lb/>
            came to light.</p>
          <p>Cal. Tell me, Chaerephon, is Socrates in earnest in all <note type="margin"> c. 37</note> <lb/>
            this, or only joking ?</p>
          <p>Cheer. I should say, Callicles, prodigiously in earnest. <lb/>
            However there's nothing like asking him the question.</p>
          <p>Gal. I'faith, that's just what I am curious to do. Tell <lb/>
            me, Socrates, are we to suppose that you are serious now or <lb/>
            in jest. For if you are serious and what you say is really <lb/>
            true, the life of all of us must have been turned upside down, <lb/>
            musn't it ? and we are all doing the exact contrary it seems <lb/>
            to what we ought to do.</p>
          <p>Soc. Callicles, if we men had not certain feelings in <lb/>
            common, though they do vary in different individuals1 but <note type="footnote"> ments of correction and cure, they are no injury but a benefit. The true and <lb/>
            real punishment of injustice and vice is to let them take their course, and to <lb/>
            encourage and foster their growth as well as secure the impunity of the offender <lb/>
            by every means in our power-only in so doing, he adds half in joke, we must <lb/>
            take good care that the injustice which we encourage is not exercised at our <lb/>
            own expense, which would rather spoil the fun for us. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 That is there are 'affections,' <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάθη πάθήαταμ</foreign> feelings, sentiments, <lb/>
            common to the whole human race, the same in kind, but varying in different <lb/>
            individuals in the mode degree circumstances and objects of their exercise. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="60"/>
            if one of us had feelings peculiar to himself and so differing <lb/>
            from the rest of mankind 1 it would not be easy for one of <lb/>
            us to exhibit to his neighbour any of his own impressions. I <lb/>
            make this remark in consequence of having observed that <lb/>
            you and I are just now in pretty much the same condition, <lb/>
            enamoured, that is, the pair of us, of two things apiece, I of <lb/>
            Alcibiades son of Clinias and philosophy, and you of the <lb/>
            Athenian Demus and the son of Pyrilampes 2. Now I re- <lb/>
            mark constantly that with all your cleverness however much <lb/>
            your favourite may talk and whatever opinion he may hap- <lb/>
            pen to pronounce about any thing, you can't contradict him, <lb/>
            but are constantly changing backwards and forwards. If it <lb/>
            be in the assembly that you are making a speech, and Demus <lb/>
            theAthenian Demus I mean—doesn't agree with you, <lb/>
            you veer round at once and say any thing it pleases, or when <lb/>
            you are talking to that fair youth the son of Pyrilampes, <lb/>
            the very same thing happens to you; you can't resist any <lb/>
            thing that your minion resolves or says, and therefore if any <lb/>
            one were to express surprise at the oddity of what you are <lb/>
            constantly saying to oblige them, you would tell him I dare <note type="chapter"> 482 </note> <lb/>
            say, if you chose to speak the truth, that unless your favour- <lb/>
            ite can be prevented from talking in that way you too must <lb/>
            always go on saying the same. Imagine then that you <lb/>
            have to receive precisely the same answer from me, and don't <lb/>
            be surprised at my saying this, but (if you don't like it) <lb/>
            make my mistress Philosophy leave off talking in this way. <lb/>
            For, my dear friend, she always holds the same language <lb/>
            as you hear from me now, and is far less inconstant (caprici- <lb/>
            ous) to me than any other mistress; for that son of Clinias <lb/>
            is at the mercy now of this now of that opinion, but Philo- <lb/>
            sophy is ever constant to the same. Her assertions are what <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἲδιον</foreign> is followed here by the comparative <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἤ</foreign>, as <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂλλοἒτερον, ἁλλοι̑ον διά- <lb/>

            you are now so surprised at, though you were present your- <lb/>
            self when they were made. So then either refute her, as I <lb/>
            said just now, by showing that wrong doing and impunity in <lb/>
            guilt is not the extremest of all evils ; or if you leave this un- <lb/>
            refuted, by the doc, God of the Egyptians, Callicles, Callicles <lb/>
            won't agree with you, but there will be a discord between <lb/>
            you all your life long. And yet I should think that it were <lb/>
            better for me that my lyre should be out of tune and dis- <lb/>
            cordant, or any chorus that I had furnished, or that any <lb/>
            number of men should disagree with me and say the contrary, <lb/>
            than for my own single self to be out of harmony with and <lb/>
            contradict myself.</p>
          <p>Cal. Socrates, you seem to be running riot (wantonly <note type="margin"> c. 38 </note> <lb/>
            extravagant) in your talk like a genuine popular orator; and <lb/>
            now you are declaiming in this way because Polus has fallen <lb/>
            into just the same error as he was accusing Gorgias of being <lb/>
            betrayed into in his argument with you. For he said if I <lb/>
            remember right, that when you asked Gorgias, supposing any <lb/>
            one came to him with the intention of studying rhetoric <lb/>
            without the knowledge of justice, whether he would teach <lb/>
            it him, he turned bashful and said he would, in compliance <lb/>
            with the popular prejudice, because people would be indig- <lb/>
            nant if he said no; and so by reason of this admission he <lb/>
            was forced to contradict himself; which is exactly what you <lb/>
            are so fond of. And he was quite right in my opinion in <lb/>
            ridiculing you as he did then. But now this time he has met <lb/>
            with the very same disaster himself; and for my own part, <lb/>
            what I don't approve of in what Polus said is just this, that <lb/>
            he conceded to you that doing wrong is fouler than suffering <lb/>
            it; for it was in consequence of this admission that he him- <lb/>
            self in his turn got completely entangled by you in the argu- <lb/>
            ment and had his mouth stopped, because he was ashamed <lb/>
            to say what he thought. For, Socrates, you do really divert <lb/>
            the argument to such vulgar fallacies and popular claptrap, <lb/>
            whilst you pretend all the time to be in the pursuit of truth, <lb/>
            to what is ' fair' not by nature but merely by law or con- <lb/>
             <pb n="62"/>
            vention: whereas in fact for the most part these arc opposed <note type="chapter">483 </note> <lb/>
            to one another, nature and convention : and so if a man <lb/>
            is timid and doesn't venture to say what he thinks, he <lb/>
            is forced to contradict himself. And this forsooth is your <lb/>
            ingenious device that you have discovered to take people in <lb/>
            with in your discussions; when a man asserts any thing as <lb/>
            according to law or convention you slyly substitute ' accord- <lb/>
            ing to nature' in your questions, and when he is appealing <lb/>
            to natural principles you refer to convention. A.-, for in- <lb/>
            stance in the present case, of doing and suffering wrong, <lb/>
            when Polus was speaking of what is conventionally ' fouler,' <lb/>
            you followed up what he meant 'conventionally' by arguing <lb/>
            upon it in the 'natural' sense. For it is only by custom and <lb/>
            convention that doing wrong is fouler; by nature every thing <lb/>
            is fouler which is likewise worse, as suffering wrong. For <lb/>
            in fact the endurance of such a thing as wrong is not a'man's <lb/>
            part at all, but a poor slave's, for whom death is better than <lb/>
            living-as it is indeed for any one who is unable to help him- <lb/>
            self when wronged and insulted or any one else for whom he <lb/>
            cares. However the law makers to be sure are the weaker <lb/>
            and more numerous part of mankind. It is with a view <lb/>
            therefore to themselves and their own interest that they <lb/>
            frame their laws and bestow their praises and their censures; <lb/>
            and by way of frightening the stronger sort of men who are <lb/>
            able to assert their superiority, in order that they mayn't <lb/>
            assert it over them, they tell them that self-seeking is foul <lb/>
            and unjust, and that this is what wrong doing consists in, <lb/>
            trying namely to get the advantage over one's neighbours; <lb/>
            for they are quite satisfied no doubt, being the inferiors <lb/>
            themselves, to be on an equality with the rest.</p>
          <p><note type="margin"> c. 39 </note> Such then is the reason why seeking to get more than <lb/>
            the mass of mankind is conventionally styled unjust and foul, <lb/>
            and why they call it doing wrong: whereas the truth is, in <lb/>
            my opinion, that nature herself shows on the other hand1 <note type="footnote"> I av, 'Bekk. Edd. Tur. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="63"/>
            that it is just that the better should have more than the <lb/>
            worse, and the abler than the less able. And it is plain <lb/>
            in many instances that this is so, not only in all the other <lb/>
            animals, but also in mankind in entire states and races 1, that <lb/>
            right I mean is decided to consist in this, that the stronger <lb/>
            should bear rule and have the advantage over the weaker. <lb/>
            For by what right did Xerxes invade Greece, or his fa- <lb/>
            ther Scythia? or in any other of the ten thousand similar <lb/>
            cases of the kind that might be produced? No, no, these <lb/>
            men no doubt follow nature in acting thus, aye by my faith <lb/>
            and law too, the law of nature ; not however I dare say that <lb/>
            which we frame by way of moulding the characters of the <lb/>
            best and strongest of us, whom we take from infancy, and <lb/>
            taming them like lions by spells and conjuring tricks reduce <lb/>
            them to abject slavery, telling them that they must be <note type="chapter"> 484 </note> <lb/>
            content with their fair share and that this is the meaning of <lb/>
            fairness and justice. But I fancy when there arises a man of <lb/>
            ability he flings off all these restraints and bursts them <lb/>
            asunder and makes his escape; and trampling under foot all <lb/>
            our written enactments (formularies) 2 and juggleries and <lb/>
            spells and laws, clean against nature every one of them, our <lb/>
            would-be slave rises up against us and shows himself our <lb/>
            master, and then natural justice shines forth in its true light. <lb/>
            And it seems to me that Pindar too confirms what I say in <lb/>
            the ode in which he says " Law the Lord of all, mortals and <note type="footnote"> 1 Lit. in states and races as wholes, or collectively. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 'Ypáp.p.a-ra, non de psephismatis intelligenda sunt, quoa voluit Heindorfius, <lb/>

          <p><note type="margin"> c. 40 </note> Such then is the truth in this matter, and you will be <lb/>
            convinced of it if at length you leave off your philosophy and <lb/>
            pass on to higher things. For to be sure, Socrates, philosophy <lb/>
            is a pretty thing enough, if only a man apply himself to it to <lb/>
            a moderate extent at the proper age; but if he go on spending <lb/>
            his time upon it too long, it's the ruin of a man. For if he <lb/>
            be ever so clever and yet carries these studies far on into life <lb/>
            he must needs turn out ignorant of every thing that one who <lb/>
            would be an accomplished and eminent citizen should be con- <lb/>
            versant with. For in fact people of this sort show themselves <lb/>
            ignorant of the laws of their own cities, and of all that a man <lb/>
            ought to say in his ordinary dealings with the world, public <lb/>
            or private, and of human pleasures and desires, and in short <lb/>
            quite unacquainted with the varieties of human character. <lb/>
            Accordingly when they come to undertake any private or <lb/>
            public business they make themselves ridiculous-just as no <lb/>
            doubt your public men do when they take part in your occu- <lb/>
            pations and discussions. For the fact is, as Euripides says, <lb/>
            Each shines in that, to that end presses forward, <lb/>
            Devotes to that the better part o' the day, <lb/>
            Wherein he chances to surpass himself: <note type="chapter"> 485 </note> <lb/>
            Whereas everything in which a man is weak he shuns, and <lb/>
            calls it bad names; but the other he praises, out of regard <lb/>
            for himself, thinking in this way to praise himself at the same <lb/>
            time. But no doubt the best course is to take advantage of <note type="footnote"> 1 i. e. violence is justified by the same supreme authority which inflicts it. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="65"/>
            both. Philosophy it is well to cultivate just so far as serves <lb/>
            for education, and it is no disgrace for a lad to study it: but <lb/>
            when a man already advanced in life still goes on with it, <lb/>
            the thing, Socrates, becomes ridiculous; and for my own part <lb/>
            the feeling which I have towards students of philosophy <lb/>
            is very much the same as that with which I regard those that <lb/>
            lisp in a childish way1. For whenever I see a little child to <lb/>
            whom it is still natural to talk in this way with a childish <lb/>
            lisp, I like it, and it strikes me as pretty and a sign of gentle <lb/>
            breeding and suitable to the infant's age : but when I hear a <lb/>
            little creature talk distinctly it gives me quite a disagreeable <lb/>
            impression and offends my ears and seems to me vulgar and <lb/>
            only fit for a slave. When on the other hand one hears a <lb/>
            man lisp or sees him playing childish tricks it appears <lb/>
            unmanly and one would like to give him a good flogging. <lb/>
            Just the same is the feeling that I have towards philosophical <lb/>
            studies. For when I observe attention to philosophy in a <lb/>
            young lad I approve of it, and it strikes me as becoming, and <lb/>
            I look upon it as a mark of gentle birth and breeding in <lb/>
            him, and one who neglects it I account illiberal, and as one <lb/>
            that will never deem himself capable of any fine or generous <lb/>
            action: but then when I see one advanced in life still going <lb/>
            on with his philosophy, and unable to lay it aside, such a <lb/>
            man as that (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἤδη</foreign>), Socrates, seems to me to want flogging. <lb/>
            For as I said just now a man like that, clever as he may be, <lb/>
            cannot fail to become unmanly by avoiding the centres <lb/>
            (frequented places) of the city and the market-places which <lb/>
            as the poet2 said are the places where men acquire distinc- <lb/>
            tion ; his fate is to skulk in a corner and pass the rest of his <lb/>
            life whispering with three or four lads, and never give utter- <lb/>
            ance to any free and noble and generous sentiment. <note type="footnote"> 1 Schleiermacher, note, p. 487, points out as singular and unPlatonic that <lb/>

          <p><note type="margin"> c. 41 </note> Now, Socrates, I have a great regard for you; and accord- <lb/>
            ingly I seem to be inspired now with the same feeling <lb/>
            towards you as Zethus in Euripides, whom I just referred <lb/>
            to, has towards Amphion. In fact it occurs to me to say <lb/>
            very much the same to you as he says to his brother, that <lb/>
            ‘ you neglect,' Socrates, ' what you ought to pay attention to, <lb/>
            and a soul endowed by nature with her noblest gifts you <note type="chapter"> 48G </note> <lb/>
            disfigure by a boyish disguise1; and neither amid the counsels <lb/>
            of justice will you ever deliver an opinion aright, nor find <lb/>
            aught probable and persuasive, nor devise any gallant resolu- <lb/>
            lution on another's behalf2.’ And yet, my dear Socrates— <lb/>
            and now don't be angry with me, for all that I am about to <lb/>
            say is out of regard for you—don't you think it a shame for a <lb/>
            man to be in the condition which I consider you to be in, <lb/>
            together with all those who are constantly going deeper and <lb/>
            deeper into philosophy. For as it is, if a man were to arrest <lb/>
            you or any one else of those like you and drag you off to <lb/>
            prison charging you with some crime of which you were <lb/>
            entirely innocent, you know very well that you wouldn't <lb/>
            know what to do with yourself, but there you would stand <lb/>
            with your head swimming and your mouth open not know- <lb/>
            ing what to say; and when you were brought up before the <lb/>
            court, however contemptible and wretched your accuser <lb/>
            might be, you would be condemned to die if he chose to <lb/>
            lay the penalty at death. And yet how can this be a wise <lb/>
            thing, Socrates, ' for an art to find a man highly gifted and <lb/>
            make him worse,' unable either to help himself or to rescue <note type="footnote"> 1 See note A in the Appendix. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The following verses may perhaps represent as much as Plato has here <lb/>

            tides, on t you think I should have been delighted to find one <lb/>
            of those stones with which they test gold, the best of them, <lb/>
            which would enable me by the application of it-provided, <lb/>
            that is, it bore me witness that lIlY soul had been duly cared <lb/>
            for-to be quite sure that I am in a satisfactory state, and <lb/>
            have no need of any other touchstone ?</p>
          <p>Gal. What is the meaning of this question, Socrates %</p>
          <p>Soc. I'll tell you directly. It seems to me that in meet- <lb/>
            ing you I have met with such a treasure.</p>
          <p>Gal. Why so ?</p>
          <p>Soc. I am quite convinced that whenever you agree <lb/>
            with me in any of the opinions that my soul forms, that must <lb/>
            needs be the very truth. For I perceive that one who would <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄτιμος</foreign> is usually understood to mean here ‘ in dishonour.' I think it <lb/>
            has rather the technical sense of ' one under <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀτιμία</foreign>.’ Callicles says that a man <lb/>
            who can't defend himself in a court of justice is in the same position as one who <lb/>
            has lost his civil rights, or is outlawed. The latter has lost the right of appearing <lb/>
            in court to defend himself, and the former by his ignorance and incompetency <lb/>
            is no better off, since he can make no good use of his privilege; he is equally at <lb/>
            the mercy of his enemies, and may like the other be wronged and insulted <lb/>
            with impunity. This interpretation is fully confirmed by the reference to this <lb/>

            put a soul to a sufficient test as to whether she is leading a <lb/>
            right life or the reverse, ought for that purpose (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄρα</foreign>, accord- <lb/>
            ingly,) to be possessed of three things, all of which you <lb/>
            have, knowledge and good-will and candour. For I meet <lb/>
            with many people who are unable to test me because they <lb/>
            are not wise, as you are; others again are wise enough, but <lb/>
            don't choose to tell me the truth because they don't care for <lb/>
            me, as you do; and our two foreign friends here, Gorgias <lb/>
            and Polus, are no doubt wise and kindly disposed towards <lb/>
            me, but they are somewhat deficient in frankness and are <lb/>
            rather more shy and bashful than the occasion requires: <lb/>
            surely it must be so, when they carried their modesty to <lb/>
            such a pitch, that out of sheer modesty each of them ven- <lb/>
            tures to contradict himself in the presence of a large com- <lb/>
            pany, and that on subjects of the highest importance. But <lb/>
            you have all these qualifications which the others want. <lb/>
            For you are sufficiently instructed as many ofyour country- <lb/>
            men will be ready to allow, and well disposed to me. What <lb/>
            proof have I of that ? I will tell you. I know, Callicles, <lb/>
            that there are four of you that have set up a partnership <lb/>
            for the pursuit of wisdom, yourself, and Tisander of Aphidnæ, <lb/>
            and Andron son of Androtion, and Nausicydes of Cholarges. <lb/>
            And I once heard you deliberating how far the cultivation of <lb/>
            wisdom should be carried, and I remember that an opinion <lb/>
            something like this was carried in your society; that the <lb/>
            study of philosophy was not to be so eagerly pushed forward <lb/>
            into all its minutiae, but you recommended one another to <lb/>
            be very careful not to make yourselves over wise for fear you <lb/>
            should unconsciously get spoiled. So then when I hear you <lb/>
            giving me the same advice as you did to your most intimate <lb/>
            friends it is a satisfactory proof to me that you really have <lb/>
            a kindness for me. And further that you are able to speak <lb/>
            out your mind without any superfluous modesty, you not <lb/>
            only say yourself, but the speech which you made us no long <lb/>
            time ago fully bears out your assertion. Well then, this is <lb/>
            plainly the state of the case at present; if there be any <lb/>
             <pb n="69"/>
            point in which you agree with me in our argument that must <lb/>
            have been fully tested by both of us, and there will be no <lb/>
            further occasion to submit it to any other touchstone ; for <lb/>
            it cannot have been either want of wisdom or excess of <lb/>
            modesty that induced you to make the concession, nor again <lb/>
            could it be for the purpose of deceiving me, because you <lb/>
            are my friend, as you tell me yourself: and so any argument <lb/>
            between you and me must in reality attain the very perfec- <lb/>
            tion of truth. And, Callicles, there can be no nobler subject <lb/>
            of inquiry than that on which you just now took me to task, <lb/>
            what a man's character ought to be, and what pursuits he <lb/>
            should engage in, and to what extent, early or late in life. <lb/>
            For of this you may be sure, that if there be any thing <note type="chapter"> 488 </note> <lb/>
            in my own conduct in life that is wrong, the error on my <lb/>
            part is not intentional but is due solely to my ignorance. <lb/>
            Pray then don't desist from admonishing me as you did at <lb/>
            first, but point out to me clearly what it is that I ought <lb/>
            to pursue, and how I may best attain it. And if you find <lb/>
            me assenting to you now, and afterwards not acting in con- <lb/>
            formity with what I agreed to, set me down for an abso- <lb/>
            lute dunce and never give me any advice again as an <lb/>
            irreclaimable reprobate. And now pray repeat to me all <lb/>
            over again what you and Pindar understand natural justice <lb/>
            to consist in. Is it that the superior should carry off by <lb/>
            force the property of the inferior, and the better rule the <lb/>
            worse, and the nobler have more than the meaner ? Is <lb/>
            justice any thing else according to you, or does my memory <lb/>
            serve me right ?</p>
          <p>Cal. No, I said that before, and I say so now. <note type="margin"> c. 43 </note> </p>
          <p>Soc. And do you mean the same thing in calling a man <lb/>
            better and superior ? For to tell you the truth I was just as <lb/>
            unable before as now to make out your precise meaning. Is <lb/>
            it the stronger that you call superior, and are the weaker <lb/>
            bound to listen to the stronger- as for example I believe you <lb/>
            showed us before that it is in pursuance of their natural <lb/>
            right that the great states attack the little ones, because they <lb/>
             <pb n="70"/>
            are superior and stronger, on the assumption that what is <lb/>
            superior and better and stronger is all the same-or is it <lb/>
            possible to be better and at the same time inferior and <lb/>
            weaker, and to be superior and yet worse? or is the definition <lb/>
            of the better and superior the same ? This is precisely the <lb/>
            thing that I want you distinctly to determine for me, whether <lb/>
            what is superior and what is better and what is stronger are <lb/>
            the same thing or different.</p>
          <p>Cal. Well I tell you distinctly that it is all the same.</p>
          <p>Soc. Well but are not the many superior by nature to <lb/>
            the one ? those you know that make the laws to control the <lb/>
            one, as you said yourself just now.</p>
          <p>Cal. Of course.</p>
          <p>Soc. Consequently the institutions of the many are those <lb/>
            of the superior.</p>
          <p>Cal. No doubt.</p>
          <p>Soc. And so of the better? for the superior are far better <lb/>
            according to your account.</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. And so their institutions are naturally ‘ fair,' since <lb/>
            they are superior ?</p>
          <p>Cal. I allow it.</p>
          <p>Soc. Is not this then the opinion of the many, as you said <lb/>
            just now yourself, that justice consists in having an equal <lb/>
            share, and that it is 'fouler' to do wrong than to suffer it ? Is <note type="chapter"> 489 </note> <lb/>
            that so or not ? And mind you don't allow yourself this time <lb/>
            to be caught in a fit of modesty. Is it, or is it not, the opi- <lb/>
            nion of the many that to have one's fair share, and not a larger <lb/>
            share, is just, and that there is more disgrace in doing than in <lb/>
            suffering wrong? Don't grudge me an answer to my question, <lb/>
            Callicles ; in order that, supposing you agree with me, I may <lb/>
            then fairly assure myself of the truth of it as coming from <lb/>
            you, when I find it admitted by a man so competent to decide.</p>
          <p>Cal. Well to be sure the generality of men do think so.</p>
          <p>Soc. Then it is not by law (convention) alone that doing <lb/>
            wrong is more disgraceful than suffering it, and that justice <lb/>
            % <lb/>
             <pb n="71"/>
            consists in having one's fair share, but by nature too. And <lb/>
            so you seem to be mistaken in what you said before and to <lb/>
            find fault with me unjustly in saying that law and nature are <lb/>
            opposite to one another, and that I, you know, am perfectly <lb/>
            aware of all that, and take an unfair advantage of it in <lb/>
            arguing; when a thing is asserted ‘according to nature' <lb/>
            recurring to law, and when according to law' is meant, to <lb/>
            nature.</p>
          <p>Cal. Here's a fellow that can not forbear trifling. Tell <note type="margin"> c. 44 </note> <lb/>
            me, Socrates, are you not ashamed to be word-catching at <lb/>
            your age, and if a man happen to trip in an expression to <lb/>
            take that for a wonderful piece of luck ? For do you suppose <lb/>
            I mean anything else by being superior than being better ? <lb/>
            Haven't I been telling you ever so long that I maintain what <lb/>
            is better and superior to be the same thing? Or do you sup- <lb/>
            pose I mean that if a rabble of slaves and all sorts of fellows <lb/>
            good for nothing except perhaps in mere bodily strength <lb/>
            get together, and they pronounce anything, that this and <lb/>
            nothing else is law.</p>
          <p>Soc. Very good, most sagacious Callicles: that's your <lb/>
            opinion, is it ?</p>
          <p>Cal. To be sure it is.</p>
          <p>Soc. Well, my dear sir, I have been surmising myself <lb/>
            ever so long that you meant something of that sort by <lb/>
            superior, and I now repeat my questions from a real curiosity <lb/>
            to know what your meaning is. For I presume you don't <lb/>
            think that two are better than one or that your slaves are <lb/>
            better than yourself because they are stronger than you are. <lb/>
            Come now tell me all over again, what you really mean by <lb/>
            'the better, since it is not the stronger. Only, my good <lb/>
            friend, do pray be a little milder in your lessons that I may <lb/>
            not be obliged to run away from your school.</p>
          <p>Cal. You are sarcastic, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Soc. No by Zethus, Callicles, whose character you as- <lb/>
            sumed just now to indulge in a good deal of sarcasm against <lb/>
            me; but come, do tell us who you mean by the better.</p><pb n="72"/>
            
          <p>Cal. I mean the more worthy.</p>
          <p>Soc. There now, you see you are word-catching your- <lb/>
            self and explaining nothing. Won't you say whether you <lb/>
            mean by the better and superior the wiser or any others ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Why to be sure of course I mean these, most em- <lb/>
            phatically.</p>
          <p><note type="chapter"> 490 </note> Soc. Then according to your account one man of sense <lb/>
            is often superior to ten thousand fools, and he ought to be <lb/>
            master and the others submit to his authority, and the <lb/>
            governor ought to have more than the governed. That is <lb/>
            what your words seem to me to imply-and I am not word- <lb/>
            catching-if the one is superior to the ten thousand.</p>
          <p>Cal. Well that is what I mean. For my opinion is that <lb/>
            this is what natural justice consists in, and that one that is <lb/>
            better and wiser should have power and other advantages <lb/>
            over the meaner and inferior.</p>
          <p><note type="margin"> c. 45 </note> Soc. Stop there now. What is it that you say again <lb/>
            this time ? Supposing that there are a number of us together, <lb/>
            as now, in the same place, and we have in a common stock <lb/>
            a quantity of eatables and drinkables, and are people of all <lb/>
            sorts, some strong others weak; and one of us, a physician <lb/>
            say, be wiser than the rest in such matters, and be as is likely <lb/>
            stronger than some of us and weaker than others, will not <lb/>
            he as being wiser than we are be better and superior in these <lb/>
            things ?</p>
          <p>Cal. No doubt of it.</p>
          <p>Soc. Is he then to have a larger share than the rest of <lb/>
            us in these provisions because he is better ? or ought he in <lb/>
            virtue of his authority to have the distribution of them all, but <lb/>
            in respect of spending and consuming them upon his own <lb/>
            person to have no advantage at all, but only have more than <lb/>
            some and less than others ? or if he chance to be the weakest <lb/>
            of us all, ought he not, Callicles, though the best to have the <lb/>
            smallest share of all ? Is it not so, my good friend ?</p>
          <p>Cal. You are talking about things to eat and drink and <lb/>
            physicians and a parcel of stuff; but that's not what I mean.</p><pb n="73"/>
            
          <p>Soc. Well then, do you call one that is wiser better? say <lb/>
            yes or no.</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes I do.</p>
          <p>Soc. But don't you allow that the better ought to have <lb/>
            the larger share ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes, but not of things to eat and drink.</p>
          <p>Soc. I understand. Well, of clothes perhaps, and the <lb/>
            most skilful weaver ought to have the largest coat and go <lb/>
            about dressed in the most extensive assortment of the finest <lb/>
            clothes.</p>
          <p>Cal. Clothes indeed! Nonsense.</p>
          <p>Soc. Well in shoes then; plainly the wisest in them and <lb/>
            the best ought to have the advantage. The shoemaker I dare <lb/>
            say ought to walk about in the biggest shoes and the largest <lb/>
            stock of them.</p>
          <p>Cal. Shoes ? Stuff. What nonsense you keep talking.</p>
          <p>Soc. Well if you don't mean that sort of thing, perhaps <lb/>
            it is something of this kind : a farmer for instance of know- <lb/>
            ledge and skill in the cultivation of land; he perhaps ought <lb/>
            to have an advantage in seed, and use the largest allowance <lb/>
            of seed upon his own land.</p>
          <p>Cal. How fond you are of perpetually repeating the <lb/>
            same things, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Soc. Yes, and not only that, Callicles, but on the same <lb/>
            subjects too1.</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes by heaven, you absolutely never leave off <note type="chapter"> 491 </note> <lb/>
            talking about cobblers and fullers and cooks and physicians, <lb/>
            just as if our argument had any thing to do with them.</p>
          <p>Soc. Well then will you tell me what the things are <note type="footnote"> 1 This repartee was really made by Socrates to the omniscient and all ac- <lb/>
            complished Hippias, Xen. Memor. IV. 4. 6, to whom it is applied with much <lb/>
            greater force and propriety than to Callicles here-and I think also, in spite of <lb/>
            the a priori improbability of the supposition, expressed by the dry matter-of- <lb/>

            in which the superior and the wiser man has a right to a <lb/>
            larger share ? or will you neither tolerate any suggestion of <lb/>
            mine nor offer one yourself?</p>
          <p>Cal. Why I have been telling you ever so long. First <lb/>
            of all by ' the superior' I don't mean shoemakers nor cooks, <lb/>
            but those who have skill and ability in the administration of <lb/>
            the affairs of state, and not only skill but energy and vigour <lb/>
            too, able to execute any designs they have conceived and not <lb/>
            men to flinch from feebleness of spirit.</p>
          <p><note type="margin"> c. 46 </note> Soc. Do you observe, most worthy Callicles, that you <lb/>
            don't find the same fault with me that I do with you ? For <lb/>
            you say that I am constantly repeating the same things and <lb/>
            reproach me for it, whereas I charge you on the contrary with <lb/>
            never saying the same thing on the same subject; but first <lb/>
            you defined the better and superior to be the stronger, and <lb/>
            next the wiser, and now here you are again with something <lb/>
            different; you tell us that superiority and merit consists in a <lb/>
            certain manliness and energy. Nay, lilY good friend, do tell <lb/>
            us and have done with it who you really do mean by the <lb/>
            better and superior and in what.</p>
          <p>Cal. Why I have told you already, men of ability and <lb/>
            energy in affairs of state. These are the men that ought to be <lb/>
            masters in their cities, and justice means this, that these <lb/>
            should have more than the rest, the governors than the <lb/>
            governed.</p>
          <p>Soc. How's that? Than themselves, my friend1? <note type="footnote"> 1 I have followed here, as usual, the text of the Zurich Editors, who with <lb/>
            Bekker from one MS. omit the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἢ τί ἄρχοντας ἢ ἀρχομένους</foreign>, as an explana- <lb/>
            tory gloss on <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτῶν</foreign>. Heindorf retains them without alteration, and it cannot be <lb/>
            denied that they make perfectly good sense in that position. Otherwise they <lb/>
            maybe made to follow Callicles' <foreign xml:lang="grc">πῶς λέγεις</foreign>; and then Socrates' answer <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕνα <lb/>
            ἕκαστον κ.τ.λ</foreign>. will be a direct reply to them. Stallbaum extracts from Olym- <lb/>
            piodorus' commentary an entirely different reading, which makes excellent <lb/>
            sense, but is not as it seems to me a very Platonic bit of dialogue. The ob- <lb/>
            ject of the question is, as Olympiodorus notes, to introduce the subject of <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">σωφροσύνη</foreign>, self-government or self-control. What do you say, asks Socrates, <lb/>
            to the case of a man governing himself? must be have a larger share than-</note> <pb n="75"/>
            </p>
          <p>Cal. What do you mean ?</p>
          <p>Soc. I mean that every man is his own governor. Or is <lb/>
            this governing one's self not required, but only governing <lb/>
            others ?</p>
          <p>Cal. What do you mean by governing one's self?</p>
          <p>Soc. Nothing that need puzzle you, but just what people <lb/>
            in general mean; one that is temperate and has the control <lb/>
            over himself, master of all the pleasures and desires in <lb/>
            himself.</p>
          <p>Cal. What a charming person you are ! you mean those <lb/>
            simpletons ' the temperate.'</p>
          <p>Soc. How should I ? every one knows that I don't mean <lb/>
            that.</p>
          <p>Cal. No indeed I should think not, Socrates. For how <lb/>
            can a man be happy if he is a slave to any one whatever ? <lb/>
            But this is what is fair and just according to nature, as I <lb/>
            tell you now quite frankly, that' a man who would lead a <lb/>
            right life is bound to let all his desires grow to their full <note type="chapter"> 492 </note> <lb/>
            extent and not to repress them, and to be competent to <lb/>
            minister to them when they are as great as they can be by <lb/>
            his manly energy and wisdom and to satisfy every desire that <lb/>
            he may chance to conceive. But this I dare say is for the <lb/>
            many impossible. And this is why they find fault with such <lb/>
            characters, out of shame, to disguise their own weakness, and <note type="footnote"> himself ? It is of course only half in earnest. I should myself have preferred rl <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">δὲ αὑτῶν, ω ὲταῖρε</foreign>; without the interrogation at <foreign xml:lang="grc">τί δέ</foreign>. ' What say you to. <lb/>
            themselves, my friend?' There are other conjectures besides those mentioned, <lb/>
            which may be found in Stallbaum's note. </note> <note type="footnote"> 1 Here again there is a difference of reading. The MSS. have <foreign xml:lang="grc">πῶς γὰρ οὐ</foreign>; <lb/>
            and <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ τοῦτο</foreign>. One of the two negatives must be rejected. The Zurich Editors, <lb/>
            after Hermann, have omitted the first. Stallbaum retains this, and alters <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ <lb/>
            τοῦτο</foreign> into <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὔτω</foreign> in this sense; ‘ Of course I do, i. e. mean those that you call <lb/>

            δρα</foreign> in Callicles' reply will signify, yes indeed those are what you mean; i. e. <lb/>
            they really are simpletons that you call temperate. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅτι δεῖ κ.τ.λ</foreign>. may be the epexegesis of TOSTO, but I think rather that <lb/>
            there is a slight change of construction, and that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅτι δεῖ</foreign> is accommodated to <lb/>

            say forsooth that unrestrained indulgence is disgraceful, <lb/>
            enslaving as I said before the more highly gifted of mankind ; <lb/>
            and, unable themselves to procure the gratification of their <lb/>
            appetites, they commend self-control and justice by reason of <lb/>
            their own want of manhood. For to such men as have had <lb/>
            the advantage of being either kings' sons or of having abili- <lb/>
            ties of their own adequate to procure for themselves any kind <lb/>
            of power or tyranny or despotic authority1 what in very <lb/>
            truth were baser and worse than self-control ? if, when they <lb/>
            are at liberty to have the enjoyment of all good things and <lb/>
            nothing stands in their way, they were of their own accord to <lb/>
            invite to be masters over them the laws and notions and <lb/>
            censures of the vulgar herd of men ? Or how could they fail <lb/>
            to have been made miserable by the ' fairness' as you call it of <lb/>
            justice and self-control, if they have no more to bestow upon <lb/>
            their own friends than their enemies, and that too when they <lb/>
            are rulers in their native cities ? Nay, in good truth, Socra- <lb/>
            tes, which you profess to seek after, the case stands thus: <lb/>
            luxury and self-indulgence and liberty to do as you please, <lb/>
            provided they have power to back them, these are virtue and <lb/>
            happiness : and all the rest of these fine-sounding phrases, <lb/>
            your conventions in violation of nature, are nothing but <lb/>
            people's nonsense and utterly contemptible.</p>
          <p><note type="margin"> c. 47 </note> Soc. Upon my word, Callicles, there is really something <lb/>

              tell me; you say, do you, that the desires are not to be re- <lb/>

              is to let them grow to their fullest extent and procure from <lb/>
              some source or other satisfaction for them, and that this is <lb/>
              virtue?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes, that's what I say.</p>
          <p>Soc. Then it isn't true as people say that those that <lb/>
            want nothing are happy.</p>
          <p>Cal. Why at that rate stones and corpses would be <lb/>
            happy.</p>
          <p>Soc. Well to be sure, as you say, our life is indeed a <lb/>
            strange one. For to say the truth I shouldn't be surprised if <lb/>
            Euripides is right when he says, <lb/>
            Who knoweth if to live is to be dead, <lb/>
            And to be dead to live? <lb/>
            and we are all really dead-as indeed I once heard from one <note type="chapter">493</note> <lb/>
            of our sages, that in our present state we are dead, and the <lb/>
            body is our tomb, and that part of the soul in which the <lb/>
            desires reside is of a nature liable to be over persuaded and <lb/>
            to be swayed continually to and fro. And so some smart <lb/>
            clever fellow, a Sicilian I dare say or Italian, turned this into <lb/>
            a fable or allegory, and, playing with the word, from its sus- <lb/>
            ceptibility to all impressions and capacity for holding belief <lb/>
            gave it the name of ajar, and the foolish he called uniniti- <lb/>
            ated: in these uninitiated, that part of the soul where the <lb/>
            desires lie, the licentious and non-retentive portion of it, he <lb/>
            compared to a jar full of holes, because there was no pos- <lb/>
            sibility of filling or satisfying it. So then he you see, Calli- <lb/>
            cles, takes the opposite view to you, showing that of all those <lb/>
            in Hades-meaning you know the invisible-those who are <lb/>
            uninitiated will be the most miserable, and have to carry <lb/>
            water into their leaky jar in a sieve perforated just like the <lb/>
             <pb n="78"/>
            other. And then' by the sieve, as my informant told me, he <lb/>
            means the soul: and the soul of the foolish he likened to a <lb/>
            sieve because it is full of holes, as incapable of holding any- <lb/>
            thing by reason of its incredulity and forgetfulness (i. e. its <lb/>
            inaptitude for receiving and retaining knowledge). Now all <lb/>
            this to be sure is pretty tolerably whimsical; still it repre- <lb/>
            sents clearly what I want to prove to you, if I can manage it <lb/>
            any how, in order to persuade you to change your mind; to <lb/>
            choose, that is, in preference to a life of insatiable self-indul- <lb/>
            gence one that is orderly and regular and ever content and <lb/>
            satisfied with what it has for the time being. But now am I <lb/>
            making any impression upon you, and are you coming round <lb/>
            to my opinion that the regular livers are happier than those <lb/>
            who indulge themselves without restraint? or none at all? <lb/>
            and will no amount of such fables incline you a bit the more <lb/>
            to change your mind?</p>
          <p>Cal. The latter is nearer the truth, Socrates. <note type="margin"> c. 48 </note> <lb/>
            Soc. Well then, let me give you another comparison <lb/>
            from the same school2 as the preceding. See if you allow <lb/>
            something of this sort to be a representation of each of the <lb/>
            two lives, the life of self-control and of self-indulgence, as it <lb/>
            might be if of two men each had several jars, and those of <lb/>

            hard to get at and procurable only by many severe toils. <lb/>
            Well, the one when he has filled himself draws no more and <lb/>
            troubles himself no more about the matter, but as far as this <lb/>
            is concerned remains quite at his ease: but the other finds, <lb/>

            fering the extremity of misery. If such be the nature of <lb/>
            each of these two lives do you maintain that that of the <lb/>
            self-indulgent man is happier than that of the regular and <lb/>
            orderly? Have I moved you at all by what I have said to <lb/>
            admit that the life of order is better than that of self-indul- <lb/>
            gence, or have I not?</p>
          <p>Gal. You have not, Socrates. For the one who has <lb/>
            filled himself has no more pleasure remaining, but that is <lb/>
            just what I called awhile ago living like a stone after a man <lb/>
            is full1, no more sensible to pleasure or pain. But the real <lb/>
            pleasure of life consists in this, in the influx of as much as <lb/>
            possible.</p>
          <p>Soc. Well but if the amount of the influx be great must <lb/>
            not that of what runs away be great too? and must not the <lb/>
            holes for these discharges be of large size ?</p>
          <p>Gal. No doubt.</p>
          <p>Soc. Then it's a plover's life2 that you are describing this <lb/>
            time, and not that of a corpse or a stone. And now tell me, <lb/>
            do you mean (by a life of pleasure) something of this kind, <lb/>
            as for instance to be constantly eating when you are hungry?</p>
          <p>Gal. Yes I do.</p>
          <p>Soc. And to be thirsty, and always drinking when you <lb/>
            are thirsty? <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">πληρώσῃ</foreign>, the reading of MSS., requires us to understand TOuS <foreign xml:lang="grc">πίθους</foreign>, or <lb/>

          <p>Cal. What a strange creature you are, Socrates; and a <lb/>
            thoroughpaced declaimed (platform orator).</p>
          <p>Soc. Just so, Callicles, and that's how I came to startle <lb/>
            Polus and Gorgias before and put them out of countenance; <lb/>
            but you never will be either startled or disconcerted, you are <lb/>
            such a brave fellow. Come now, just answer my question.</p>
          <p>Cal. Well then I allow that a man may pass a pleasant <lb/>
            life in scratching himself.</p>
          <p>Soc. And if a pleasant one a happy one too?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes certainly.</p>
          <p>Soc. Is that so if the itching be confined to his head? or <lb/>
            what more must I ask you? See, Callicles, what answer you <lb/>
            will make if you be asked all that is naturally connected with <lb/>
            (logically follows from) this theory of yours one after another. <lb/>

            are abundantly supplied with what they want?</p>
          <p>Cal. Are you not ashamed, Socrates, to introduce such <lb/>

            feel pleasure, whatever that pleasure may be, are happy; and <note type="chapter"> 495 </note> <lb/>
            makes no distinction between the good and bad sorts of it? <lb/>
            But come now, tell me once more whether you say that plea- <lb/>
            sure and good are the same thing, or that there is some kind <lb/>
            of pleasure which is not good?</p>
          <p>Cal. Well then in order to avoid the inconsistency of <lb/>
            pronouncing them to be different, I say they are the same.</p>
          <p>Soc. You are spoiling all the professions1 you made at <lb/>
            the outset, Callicles, and you can no longer go along with me <lb/>
            satisfactorily in the investigation of the truth, if you say <lb/>
            what is contrary to your real opinion.</p>
          <p>Cal. Why so do you, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Soc. Well then I am quite in the wrong if I do, and so <lb/>
            are you. But now, my dear fellow, look whether good be not <lb/>
            something entirely different to what you say, that is to plea- <lb/>
            sure from whatever source derived: for not only those that I <lb/>
            have just now hinted at, but a number of other shameful <lb/>
            consequences manifestly follow, if this is really so.</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes in your opinion, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Soc. And do you really mean to maintain this, Callicles?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes I do.</p>
          <p>Soc. Then are we to suppose you to be serious and so <note type="margin"> c. 50 </note> <lb/>
            enter upon the discussion of the question ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Oh yes by all means.</p>
          <p>Soc. Well then since that is your opinion explain me <lb/>
            this distinctly. There is some thing I presume to which you <lb/>
            give the name of knowledge ?</p>
          <p>Cal. To be sure there is.</p>
          <p>Soc. And didn't you say just now that there is such <lb/>
            a thing as courage also as well as knowledge ?</p>
          <p>Cal. I did no doubt. <note type="footnote"> 1 Professions of dealing frankly and openly in stating his convictions. <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Soc. And you meant, didn't you, to speak of them as <lb/>
            two things, because the one is distinct from the other?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes quite.</p>
          <p>Soc. Again; pleasure and knowledge, are they the same <lb/>
            thing or different ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Different to be sure, you mighty genius.</p>
          <p>Soc. And courage again, is that distinct from pleasure ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Of course it is.</p>
          <p>Soc. Come now, mind we don't forget this, that Callicles <lb/>
            of Acharnæ pronounced pleasure and good to be the same <lb/>
            thing, and knowledge and courage to be different from one <lb/>
            another and from the good.</p>
          <p>Cal. And Socrates of Alopece we can't get (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡμῖν</foreign>) to ad- <lb/>
            mit it. He doesn't, does he ?</p>
          <p>Soc. He does not; and I think not Callicles either, <lb/>
            when he has duly examined himself For tell me this, don't <lb/>
            you think that those that are well off are in the opposite <lb/>
            condition to those that are ill off?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes I do.</p>
          <p>Soc. If then these two states are opposite to one another, <lb/>
            must not the case be the same with them as with health and <lb/>
            disease ? For to be sure a man is never well and ill at once, <lb/>
            nor is he delivered from health and disease at one and the <lb/>
            same time.</p>
          <p>Cal. How do you mean ?</p>
          <p><note type="chapter"> 496 </note> Soc. Take for instance any part of the body you please <lb/>

          <p>Cal. By no manner of means.</p>
          <p>Soc. And again, when he gets rid of his ophthalmia, does <lb/>
            he at that same time get rid of the health of his eyes too, <lb/>
            and so at last get rid of them both together ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Quite impossible.</p><pb n="83"/>
            
          <p>Soc. Because such a result would be marvellous and <lb/>
            unreasonable, wouldn't it ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Very much so.</p>
          <p>Soc. On the contrary, I should suppose, he acquires and <lb/>
            loses either of them alternately.</p>
          <p>Cal. I agree.</p>
          <p>Soc. And so with strength and weakness in the same <lb/>
            way ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. And speed and slowness ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Soc. And likewise good things and happiness, and their <lb/>
            opposites, bad things and misery, does a man acquire each of <lb/>
            them in turn, and in turn lose it ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Most assuredly.</p>
          <p>Soc. Then if we find any things which a man loses and <lb/>
            retains simultaneously, it is plain that these cannot be what <lb/>
            is good and what is bad. Do we admit this ? Now consider <lb/>
            very carefully before you answer.</p>
          <p>Cal. Oh, I admit it to the most unlimited (prodigious, <lb/>
            supernatural) extent.</p>
          <p>Soc. Then let us pass on to our former admissions. Did <note type="margin"> c. 51</note> <lb/>
            you say that hunger is pleasant or painful ? hunger I mean <lb/>
            in itself.</p>
          <p>Cal. Painful to be sure; though at the same time <lb/>
            eating when one is hungry is pleasant.</p>
          <p>Soc. I understand: however at all events hunger in <lb/>
            itself is painful, is it not ?</p>
          <p>Cal. I allow it.</p>
          <p>Soc. And so with thirst likewise ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Quite so.</p>
          <p>Soc. Must I then ask you any more questions, or do you <lb/>
            admit that every kind of want and desire is painful ?</p>
          <p>Cal. I admit it, dont ask me any more.</p>
          <p>Soc. Very good. But drinking when one is thirsty, you <lb/>
            admit, don't you, to be pleasant ? <note type="footnote"> 6—2 </note> <pb n="84"/>
            </p>
          <p>Cal. Certainly I do.</p>
          <p>Soc. And in this phrase of yours the words ' when one is <lb/>
            thirsty' imply pain I presume.</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. But ' drinking' is the supplying of a want, and a <lb/>
            pleasure ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. So then in the act of drinking you say a man feels <lb/>
            pleasure ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Soc. When he is thirsty ?</p>
          <p>Cal. To be sure.</p>
          <p>Soc. That is with pain ?</p>
          <p>Gal. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. Do you perceive then what follows, that you allow <lb/>
            that pleasure and pain are felt at once when you say that <lb/>
            a man drinks when he is thirsty ? Or does this not take <lb/>
            place at once at the same time and place, in the soul or the <lb/>
            body, whichever you prefer to call it: for I fancy it makes <lb/>
            no difference. Is this so, or not ?</p>
          <p>Cal. It is.</p>
          <p>Soc. But moreover you said it was impossible to fare <lb/>
            well and ill at the same time.</p>
          <p>Cal. And so I do.</p>
          <p><note type="chapter"> 497 </note> Soc. But to feel pleasure in feeling pain you have <lb/>
            admitted to be possible.</p>
          <p>Cal. So it appears.</p>
          <p>Soc. Consequently to feel pleasure is not to fare well, <lb/>
            nor pain ill, so that it follows that what is pleasant is different <lb/>
            from what is good.</p>
          <p>Cal. I don't know what all this quibbling of yours <lb/>
            means, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Soc. Oh yes you do, but you affect ignorance, Callicles. <lb/>

            not in each one of us the thirst and the pleasure conveyed by <lb/>
            drinking cease simultaneously ?</p>
          <p>Cal. I don't know what you are talking about.</p>
          <p>Gorgias. Don't do that Callicles, but answer him, if it <lb/>
            be only for our sakes, that the argument may be fairly <lb/>
            brought to a conclusion.</p>
          <p>Cal. Oh but Socrates is always like this, Gorgias; he <lb/>
            goes on asking over and over again a number of trifling and <lb/>
            unimportant questions and so refutes one.</p>
          <p>Gor. Well but what does that matter to you? Any how <lb/>
            the penalty does not fall upon you, Callicles: come, come, <lb/>
            submit yourself to Socrates to refute as he pleases.</p>
          <p>Cal. Well then go on with your paltry trumpery ques- <lb/>
            tions, since Gorgias wishes it.</p>
          <p>Soc. You are a lucky fellow, Callicles, in having got ini- <note type="margin"> c. 52</note> <lb/>
            late into the greater mysteries before the lesser; 1 thought <lb/>
            that wasn't allowed. So then let us begin at the point where <lb/>
            you left off, and let us know whether each of us doesn't cease <lb/>
            to feel thirst and pleasure simultaneously.</p>
          <p>Cal. I allow it.</p>
          <p>Soc. And the same with hunger; and in all other cases, <lb/>
            doesn't he cease to feel the desires and the pleasures to- <lb/>
            gether?</p>
          <p>Cal. It is so.</p>
          <p>Soc. So then the pains likewise and the pleasures he <lb/>
            ceases to feel together?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. But the cessation of what is good and bad is not <lb/>
            simultaneous in him, as you admitted before-and won't you <lb/>
            do so now?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes I will; and what then? <note type="footnote"> unfailing politeness, but also interrupt the natural run of the sentence. I take <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Soc. Only that it turns out, my friend, that the good is <lb/>
            not the same as the pleasant nor the bad as the painful; for <lb/>
            the one pair ceases in a man simultaneously and the other <lb/>
            does not, because they are distinct1. How then can what is <lb/>
            pleasant be the same as what is good or what is painful as <lb/>
            what is bad? Or if you please, consider it again in this way; <lb/>
            for I dare say even yet you don't admit it. However look at <lb/>
            it. In those that you call good, is not that name due to the <lb/>
            presence of goodness, just as it is in the handsome to the <lb/>
            presence of beauty?</p>
          <p>Cal. To be sure.</p>
          <p>Soc. Well; do you give the name of good men to fools <lb/>
            and cowards? You didn't just now at any rate, but to the <lb/>
            brave and wise. These are the sort of people that you call <lb/>
            good, are they not?</p>
          <p>Cat. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Soc. Well; have you ever- seen a silly child pleased?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes I have.</p>
          <p>Soc. And have you never seen a silly man pleased before <lb/>
            now?</p>
          <p>Cal. I should think so; but what has that to do with it ?</p>
          <p>Soc. Oh nothing; only answer the question.</p>
          <p>Cal. I have.</p>
          <p><note type="chapter"> 498 </note> Soc. And again, a man of sense under the influence of <lb/>
            pain or pleasure?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. And which of the two are more susceptible of plea- <lb/>
            sure and pain, wise men or fools?</p>
          <p>Cal. I should suppose there isn't much difference.</p>
          <p>Soc. Well even that's enough. And have you ever seen <lb/>
            a coward in time of war?</p>
          <p>Cal. Of course I have.</p>
          <p>Soc. Well then, upon the enemy's retreat, which of the <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὡς ἑτέρων ὄντων</foreign> may be translated either as in the text, as a repetition of <lb/>
            an <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ ταὐτὰ γίγνεται</foreign>, which is Stallbaum's view: or ‘which shows that they <lb/>
            are distinct' as Schleiermacher understands it. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="87"/>
            two seemed to you to feel more pleasure, the cowards or the <lb/>
            brave ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Both of them, I thought: or if not more, pretty <lb/>
            nearly equal.</p>
          <p>Soc. That'll do just as well. However, the cowards do <lb/>
            feel pleasure?</p>
          <p>Cal. Oh yes, keenly.</p>
          <p>Soc. And the fools, it seems.</p>
          <p>Cal Yes.</p>
          <p>Soo. And upon their approach, do the cowards alone feel <lb/>
            pain, or the brave as well?</p>
          <p>Cal. Both.</p>
          <p>Soc. In an equal degree.</p>
          <p>Cal. More perhaps the cowards.</p>
          <p>Soc. And on their retreat don't they feel more pleasure?</p>
          <p>Cal. Very likely.</p>
          <p>Soc. So then according to you the fools and the wise <lb/>
            men, and the cowards and the brave feel pain and pleasure <lb/>
            in pretty nearly the same degree, or the cowards more than <lb/>
            the brave?</p>
          <p>Cal. That is my opinion.</p>
          <p>Soc. But further, are the wise and brave good, and the <lb/>
            cowards and fools bad?</p>
          <p>Cal Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. Then the good and the bad are susceptible of pain <lb/>
            and pleasure pretty nearly in the same degree?</p>
          <p>Cal. True.</p>
          <p>Soc. Are then the good and the bad good and bad in <lb/>
            pretty nearly the same degree? or the bad even in a higher <lb/>
            degree good and bad?</p>
          <p>Gal. Upon my word I don't know what you mean. <note type="margin"> c. 53 </note> <lb/>
            Soc. Don't you know that you affirm that it is by the <lb/>
            presence of good things that the good are good, and of evil <lb/>
            things (that men) are bad? and that the good things are the <lb/>
            pleasures, and the pains evil things?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes I do.</p><pb n="88"/>
            
          <p>Soc. Accordingly in those that feel pleasure, good, that <lb/>
            is pleasure, is present whenever they are pleased?</p>
          <p>Cal. Doubtless.</p>
          <p>Soc. And so, since good is present in them, those that <lb/>
            feel pleasure are good?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. Again, in those that feel pain is not evil present, <lb/>
            that is pain?</p>
          <p>Cal. It is.</p>
          <p>Soc. And it is by the presence of evil you say that the <lb/>
            bad are bad. Or are you no longer of the same mind?</p>
          <p>Cal. Oh yes, I am.</p>
          <p>Soc. It follows then that all that feel pleasure are good, <lb/>
            and all that feel pain bad?</p>
          <p>Cal. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Soc. And are they better the more they feel it, -and <lb/>
            worse the less, and if in the same degree about the same?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soo. Well and you admit don't you that the wise and <lb/>
            the fools, the cowards and the brave, are about equally ac- <lb/>
            cessible to pleasure and pain, or the cowards even more so?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes I do.</p>
          <p>Soc. Aid me then in reckoning up the results we obtain <lb/>
            from our conclusions. For, to be sure, as the saying is, <note type="chapter"> 499 </note> <lb/>
            ' twice yea thrice is it good to repeat fair things1’ and re- <lb/>
            consider them. We say that the wise and brave man is good, <lb/>
            don't we ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. And the fool and coward bad ?</p>
          <p>Cal. No doubt.</p>
          <p>Soc. And again one that feels pleasure good ? <note type="footnote"> 1 A proverb derived, as the Scholiast informs us, from a verse of Empedo- <lb/>
            cles, <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ δὶς γὰρ δ δε</foreign>ȋ <foreign xml:lang="grc">καλόν ἐστιν ἐνισπε</foreign>ȋ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ν</foreign>, a fragment which does not appear in <lb/>

            VI. 754 B; XII. 956 E. It seems probable from three of these references that <lb/>
            the verse ran, <foreign xml:lang="grc">δὶς</foreign> Kal <foreign xml:lang="grc">τρὶς γὰρ</foreign> K. T. A. </note> <pb n="89"/>
            </p>
          <p>Cal. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. And one that feels pain bad ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Necessarily.</p>
          <p>Soc. And that the good and bad are susceptible of <lb/>
            pleasure and pain in the like degree, or perhaps the bad even <lb/>
            more ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. So then is the bad man made good or bad in the <lb/>
            same degree as the good one, or even good in a greater <lb/>
            degree ? Does not this follow as well as what we said before <lb/>
            from the assertion that pleasure is identical with good ? Is <lb/>
            not this necessarily the consequence, Callicles ?</p>
          <p>Cal. To tell you the truth, Socrates, all this while that <note type="margin"> c. 54 </note> <lb/>
            I have been listening to you and assenting to all you say, <lb/>
            I have been thinking, if one makes you any concession even <lb/>
            in joke, how delighted you are with it, and hold it tight <lb/>
            like a child. Just as if you suppose that I or any one else in <lb/>
            the whole world does not believe that some pleasures are <lb/>
            better and others worse.</p>
          <p>Soc. Ho ho ! Callicles, what a sly rogue you are1. You <lb/>
            do indeed use me like a child, sometimes telling me that <lb/>
            things are one way sometimes another, trying to mislead <lb/>
            me. Why I thought you were my friend, and never would <lb/>
            mislead me intentionally: but now I see I was mistaken, and <lb/>
            it seems I must needs, as the old saying has it, make the <lb/>
            best of what I can get, and accept anything you are pleased <lb/>
            to offer me.— Well then what you say now, it seems, is that <lb/>
            there are certain pleasures, some good and some bad. Isn't <lb/>
            it ? <note type="footnote"> 1 I have translated <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰοὺ ἰού</foreign> as an exclamation ‘ mirantis et exultantis' after <lb/>
            Heindorf Stallbaum and Suidas. Perhaps however from the tone of what <lb/>
            follows, in which Socrates is affecting the manner of a child, to which Callicles <lb/>
            had compared him, in a pet, the interjection is rather <foreign xml:lang="grc">σχετλιαστικόν</foreign>—another <lb/>
            of its senses-and the words should be interpreted, ' Oh for shame, Callicles, <lb/>
            what a sly fellow you are, you are indeed treating me like a baby.' Upon the <lb/>
            whole however I think the other is to be preferred. </note> <pb n="90"/>
            </p>
          <p>Cal. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. Are then those that arc beneficial good, and the <lb/>
            injurious bad ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Soc. And are those beneficial which effect something <lb/>
            that is good, and injurious something that is bad ?</p>
          <p>Cal. I believe so.</p>
          <p>Soc. Are then these the sort you mean ? To take for <lb/>
            instance the bodily pleasures of eating and drinking that we <lb/>
            were speaking of a moment ago, if some of them produce in <lb/>
            the body health or strength or any other bodily excellence <lb/>
            are those good, and those whose effects are contrary bad ?</p>
          <p>Cal. No doubt.</p>
          <p>Soc. And so with pains in like manner, are some of <lb/>
            them good and some bad?</p>
          <p>Cal. Of course.</p>
          <p>Soc. Accordingly the good pleasures and pains we are <lb/>
            to choose and try to bring about ?</p>
          <p>Cal. To be sure.</p>
          <p>Soc. And the bad ones not \</p>
          <p>Cal. Evidently.</p>
          <p>Soc. Because if you remember, Polus and I decided that <lb/>
            all our actions should be done for the sake of what is good. <lb/>
            Do you too agree in this view, that good is the end and aim <note type="chapter"> 500 </note> <lb/>
            of all our actions and that for the sake of that everything <lb/>
            else is to be done, not that for the sake of the rest ? Do you <lb/>
            vote on our side as well, and make a third ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes I do.</p>
          <p>Soc. Then it is for the sake of what is good that every- <lb/>
            thing else including what is pleasant is to be done, not the <lb/>
            good for the sake of what is pleasant.</p>
          <p>Cal. No doubt.</p>
          <p>Soc. Is it then in everybody's power to make the selec- <lb/>
            tion amongst things pleasant what are good and what bad, or <lb/>
            is professional knowledge required for each case ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Professional knowledge.</p><pb n="91"/>
            
          <p>Soc. Then let us recal to mind what I was saying to <note type="margin"> c. 55 </note> <lb/>
            Polus and Gorgias. I said, if you recollect, that there were <lb/>
            contrivances some extending only to pleasure, effecting <lb/>
            merely that and no more, and ignorant of the distinction <lb/>
            between better and worse, and others which distinguish what <lb/>
            is good and bad : and I placed amongst those which deal <lb/>
            with pleasure, the empirical skill, not art, of the cook, and <lb/>
            amongst those which have good for their object the art of <lb/>
            medicine. And now, by the God of friendship, Callicles, <lb/>
            don't be so ill natured as either to jest with me yourself, <lb/>
            or answer at random contrary to your real opinion, or again <lb/>
            to take what I say as if I were joking. For you see that <lb/>
            this subject on which we are talking is of a nature to engage <lb/>
            the most serious attention of every man of the smallest <lb/>
            sense, I mean what course of life one ought to follow; <lb/>
            whether it be that to which you invite me, taking part in <lb/>
            those manly duties you wot of (<foreign xml:lang="grc">δή</foreign>), speaking in the public <lb/>
            assemblies and cultivating rhetoric and engaging in public <lb/>
            business as you do now a days, or this life of philosophical <lb/>
            study; and what it is in which the one differs from the other. <lb/>
            Perhaps then it is the best way to distinguish them first, as <lb/>
            I attempted to do before, and when we have done that and <lb/>
            come to an agreement between ourselves as to whether these <lb/>
            two lives really are distinguishable1, to consider next what is <lb/>
            the difference between them and which of the two ought to <note type="footnote"> 1 d <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἤστι τούτω διττὼ</foreign> TW <foreign xml:lang="grc">βίω</foreign>.

            of this union of singular verb with dual substantive is that the notion presents <lb/>
            itself first collectively as a single whole or pair to the writer's mind and is <lb/>
            afterwards separated into its parts by the introduction of the dual. Hence it <lb/>
            is that in this construction the verb precedes the substantive, as it usually does <lb/>
            likewise in the analogous case of the Schema Pindaricum or Bceoticum (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνη̑ν <lb/>

            combination of plural substantive and dual verb. In this case the persons <lb/>
            or things spoken of in the plural are tacitly divided by the writer into two <lb/>
            separate groups or classes so as to form a pair or two pairs.- See the ex- <lb/>

            be adopted. Perhaps now you don't yet quite understand my <lb/>
            meaning.</p>
          <p>Cal. No indeed I don't.</p>
          <p>Soc. Well I will explain it more clearly. Now that you <lb/>
            and I have agreed that there is such a thing as good and also <lb/>
            such a thing as pleasant, and the pleasant different from the <lb/>
            good, and that there is a particular mode of pursuit and <lb/>
            contrivance for the acquisition of either of them, the one the <lb/>
            quest of pleasure, the other of good-but first of all let me <lb/>
            know whether you assent to as much as this or not: do you ?</p>
          <p>Cal. I do.</p>
          <p><note type="margin"> c. 56 </note> Soc. Well then to proceed, let us come to an under- <lb/>
            standing about what I was saying to our friends here, and see <lb/>
            whether you think that what I then said was true. What <lb/>
            I said was if I remember right; that cookery seems to me <lb/>
            to be no art at all but a mere empirical habit; medicine an <note type="chapter"> 501 </note> <lb/>
            art; meaning that the one, that is medicine, has inquired <lb/>
            into the nature of that which it treats and the causes of what <lb/>
            it does, and can give an account of each of them; but the <lb/>
            other enters upon the pursuit of the pleasure which is the <lb/>
            object of all her care and attention quite unscientifically, <lb/>
            without having bestowed any consideration upon either the <lb/>
            nature or the cause of pleasure, and proceeds in a manner <lb/>
            absolutely irrational, as one may say, without the smallest <lb/>
            calculation, a mere knack and routine, simply retaining the <lb/>
            recollection of what usually happens, by which you know in <lb/>
            fact she provides all her pleasures1. Now consider first of all <lb/>
            whether you think that this account is so far satisfactory, <lb/>
            and that there are in like manner certain other occupations <lb/>
            of the same sort which deal with the soul, some of them <lb/>
            scientific, exercising some forethought for the soul's best <lb/>
            interests; and others that pay no regard to this, but again as <lb/>
            in the former case, study merely the soul's pleasure, how, that <note type="footnote"> 1 Compare Aristotle's account of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐμπειρία</foreign> in the first chapter of his Meta- <lb/>
            physics. It is possible that his description of it there may be one of his count- <lb/>

             <pb n="93"/>
            is, it may be procured for her, neither inquiring which of the <lb/>
            pleasures is better or worse, nor concerning themselves with <lb/>
            any thing else but mere gratification, whether that be better or <lb/>
            worse. For to me Callicles, it seems that there are, and this <lb/>
            sort of thing I call flattery whether it be applied to body or <lb/>
            soul or anything else, when the pleasure alone is studied <lb/>
            without any regard to the better and the worse. And you <lb/>
            now, do you coincide with us in opinion upon this matter or <lb/>
            dissent ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Not I, I assent-in order that you may get through <lb/>
            your argument, and I oblige my friend Gorgias here.</p>
          <p>Soc. And is this true of only one soul, and not of two or <lb/>
            many ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Not so, it is true of two and of many.</p>
          <p>Soc. Then is it possible to gratify them in a mass all at <lb/>
            once without taking any thought for what is best?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes I suppose so.</p>
          <p>Soc. Can you tell me then which are the practices that <note type="margin"> c. 57</note> <lb/>
            do this? Or rather, if you please, as I ask you, when any of <lb/>
            them seems to you to belong to this class say yes, and when <lb/>
            not say no. And first of all let us examine the case of flute <lb/>
            playing. Don't you think it is one of that sort, Callicles ? that <lb/>
            it aims only at our gratification and cares for nothing else?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes I do.</p>
          <p>Soc. And so with all others of the same kind, for ex- <lb/>
            ample harp playing, as it is practised in the musical contests?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. And again the Choral exhibitions and dithyrambic <lb/>
            compositions, don't they appear to you to belong to the same <lb/>

            the relaxation of the gravity, sobriety, and antistrophic arrangement of its <lb/>
            earlier form. Melanippides, contemporary with Cinesias, was the earliest of <lb/>
            these innovators. Aristophanes likewise ridicules the wild rambling flights and <lb/>

            audience by anything he says, or merely thinks of saying <lb/>
            what will please the mob of spectators?</p>
          <p>Cal. There is no doubt about that, Socrates, in Cinesias' <lb/>
            case at least.</p>
          <p>Soc. And his father Moles again-Did you ever suppose <lb/>
            that he looked to what is best in his harp playing? Or rather, <lb/>
            his aim perhaps was not what is most agreeable either; for <lb/>
            he used to annoy the audience by his performance. But just <lb/>
            consider; don't you think that all harp music and dithyram- <lb/>
            bic composition has been invented for the sake of pleasure?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes certainly.</p>
          <p>Soc. But what say you now to the object of all the <lb/>
            efforts of that stately and wonderful Tragic poetry? Are all <lb/>
            her efforts and her pains, think you, bestowed merely upon <lb/>
            the gratification of the spectators? or does she strive to- the <lb/>
            uttermost, if there be anything that is pleasant and agreeable <lb/>
            but bad for them, not to say that, but if there be aught un- <lb/>
            pleasant but profitable, that to say and to sing whether they <lb/>
            like it or not? Which of these two, think you, is the fashion <lb/>
            that Tragic poetry assumes?</p>
          <p>Cal. There can't be any doubt, Socrates, that she is <lb/>
            more bent upon pleasure and the gratification of the spec- <lb/>
            tators.</p>
          <p>Soc. Well but this kind of proceeding, Callicles, we said <lb/>
            just now is flattery.</p>
          <p>Cal. Certainly we did.</p>
          <p>Soc. Again, if any kind of poetry be stript of its melody <lb/>
            and rhythm and metre, is not the residue plain prose?</p>
          <p>Gal. No doubt of it.</p>
          <p>Soc. And this prose is addressed to great crowds of <lb/>
            people.</p>
          <p>Cal. It is. <note type="footnote"> Cinesias. Av. 1373 foil. Compare Nub. 332, Pax. 827 foil. See on the entire <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Soc. Consequently poetry is a kind of public speaking.</p>
          <p>Cal. So it appears.</p>
          <p>Soc. And so it will be a rhetorical address to the public. <lb/>
            You do think, don't you, that the poets in the theatres prac- <lb/>
            tise rhetoric?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes I do.</p>
          <p>Soc. So then now we have found a kind of rhetoric ad- <lb/>
            dressed to such a popular audience as consists of a mixture <lb/>
            of women and children with men, and slaves as well as free, <lb/>
            which we don't altogether approve of, because we say it is of <lb/>
            the nature of flattery.</p>
          <p>Cal. Quite so.</p>
          <p>Soc. Very good. But again, as to the rhetoric that is <note type="margin"> c. 58 </note> <lb/>
            addressed to the Athenian people or to any other popular <lb/>
            assemblies of freemen established in the various cities, what <lb/>
            are we to say to that ? Think you that the orators always <lb/>
            speak with a view to what is best, with the sole aim of im- <lb/>
            proving the citizens as far as possible by their speeches? Or <lb/>
            do they too, bent upon gratifying their fellow-citizens, and <lb/>
            sacrificing the public weal to their own private interest, deal <lb/>
            with these assemblies as with children, trying only to humour <lb/>
            them? and whether they will be better or worse in conse- <lb/>
            quence trouble themselves not at all?</p>
          <p>Cal. Your present question is not a simple one like the <note type="chapter"> 503 </note> <lb/>
            preceding; tor there are some who show a real regard for <lb/>
            their fellow-citizens in saying what they say; others there are <lb/>
            again such as you describe.</p>
          <p>Soc. That's enough. For if this also is two-fold, the one <lb/>
            branch of it is, it may be presumed, a trick of flattery and a <lb/>
            base kind of popular declamation; the other noble-the at- <lb/>
            tempt, that is, to improve to the utmost the souls of the citi- <lb/>
            zens, and the earnest striving to say what is best, whether <lb/>
            that will prove more or less agreeable to the audience. But <lb/>
            such rhetoric as this you never yet saw; or if you have any <lb/>
            one of this sort to point out amongst the orators, let me <lb/>
            know at once who he is.</p><pb n="96"/>
            
          <p>Cal. No, by my faith, I can't name you any one, at any <lb/>
            rate of the orators of the present day.</p>
          <p>Soc. Well then, can you name any one of those of by- <lb/>
            gone days to whom the Athenians are indebted for any im- <lb/>
            provement, dating from the commencement of his harangues, <lb/>
            from the worse condition in which they were previously? <lb/>
            For for my own part I don't know who it is.</p>
          <p>Cal. What? Haven't you heard of the virtues of The- <lb/>
            mistocles and Cimon and Miltiades and the famous Pericles <lb/>
            who is lately dead1, whom you have heard speak yourself?</p>
          <p>Soc. Yes, Callicles, if that is true virtue which you <lb/>
            spoke of just now, the satisfaction namely of one's own and <lb/>
            other people's desires (this may be all very well) ; but if this <lb/>
            is not so, but the truth is what we were forced to admit in <lb/>
            the argument that followed, that those desires only which <lb/>
            improve a man's character by their gratification should be <lb/>
            fulfilled, and those which deteriorate it not, and that there is <lb/>
            an art by which this may be effected-can you affirm that <lb/>
            any one of these men has shown himself such an artist as that?</p>
          <p>Cal. I really don't know what to say.</p>
          <p><note type="margin"> c. 59 </note> Soc. Nay if you search well you will find out. So then <lb/>
            let us just consider this matter quietly and see whether any <lb/>
            of these men has shown himself such- To begin; a good man <lb/>
            and one who looks to what is best in everything that he says <lb/>
            will not speak at random, will he, but always with some defi- <lb/>
            nite object in view? He will proceed in fact just like all other <lb/>
            workmen, each with his own proper work in view, selecting <lb/>
            anything that he happens to apply towards the forwarding <lb/>
            of his work not at random, but for the purpose of giving some <lb/>
            particular form to the work that he is engaged upon. Look <lb/>
            at the painter for instance, if you please, or the builder or <lb/>

            harmony with the other, until he has constructed a regular <lb/>
            and well ordered whole; and the same may be said you know <lb/>
            of all other artists; and so with those that we were speak- <lb/>
            ing of just now that deal with the body, trainers and physi- <lb/>
            cians, they likewise it would seem introduce order and system <lb/>
            into the body. Do we admit that this is so or not?</p>
          <p>Cal. Let it be as you say.</p>
          <p>Soc. So then a house in which order and harmony appear <lb/>
            will be a good one, and where there is disorder a bad one ?</p>
          <p>Cal. I allow that.</p>
          <p>Soc. And a vessel again in like manner?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. And further in our own bodies do we admit the <lb/>
            same principle?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes certainly.</p>
          <p>Soc. And how about the soul? Is it by disorder that it <lb/>
            will be made good, or by some kind of order and harmony?</p>
          <p>Cal. In accordance with our previous conclusions we <lb/>
            must needs admit this too.</p>
          <p>Soc. What name then do we give to that which arises <lb/>
            in the body from order and harmony?</p>
          <p>Cal. Health and strength I dare say you mean.</p>
          <p>Soc. I do. And what again to that which is engen- <lb/>
            dered in the soul from the same? Try to find the name of <lb/>
            it, and tell it me as in the other case.</p>
          <p>Cal. And why don't you name it yourself, Socrates?</p>
          <p>Soc. Well if you prefer it I will. And you, if you think <lb/>
            what I say is right, say so; or if not, refute it and don't let <lb/>
            it pass. For my opinion is that order in the body of every <lb/>
            kind bears the name of 'healthy,' whence it is that health <lb/>
            is produced in it and every other bodily excellence. Is it so <lb/>
            or not?</p>
          <p>Cal. It is.</p>
          <p>Soc. And the name of all the orders and harmonies of <note type="footnote"> 7 </note> <lb/>

            the soul is lawfulness and law, by which also men are made <lb/>
            observant of law and orderly; and these are justice and self- <lb/>
            control. Do you allow this or not?</p>
          <p>Cal. Be it so.</p>
          <p><note type="margin"> c. GO </note> Soc. So then it is to this that that genuine orator, the <lb/>
            man of science and virtue, will have regard in applying to <lb/>
            men's souls whatsoever words he addresses to them, and will <lb/>
            conform all his actions; and if he give any gift he will give <lb/>

            and remove all vice. Do you agree or not ?</p>
          <p>Cal. I agree.</p>
          <p>Soc. To be sure, Callicles, for what can be the advantage <lb/>
            of offering to a sick and diseased body a quantity of. the <lb/>
            nicest things to eat and drink or anything else, when, fairly <lb/>
            considered, they will do it no more good sometimes than the <lb/>
            contrary, nay less1 ? Is this so ?</p>
          <p><note type="chapter"> 505 </note> Cal. So be it.</p>
          <p>Soc. Because I presume it is no advantage to a man to <lb/>
            live with his body in a vicious state, since in that case his <lb/>
            life also must needs be a vicious2 one. It is so, isn't it ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes. <note type="footnote"> 1 I have followed Stallbaum in the interpretation of this passage, who <lb/>

            for instance to eat as much as he pleases when he is hungry <lb/>
            or drink when he is thirsty, but a sick man they never so <lb/>

          <p>Soc. And with the soul, my excellent friend, is it not <lb/>
            the same ? as long as it is in a bad condition, senseless and <lb/>
            self-indulgent and unjust and unholy, we must prevent it <lb/>
            indulging its appetites, and not suffer it to do anything but <lb/>
            what will make it better ? Do you assent, or not ?</p>
          <p>Cal. I assent.</p>
          <p>Soc. For so I presume it is better for the soul itself?</p>
          <p>Cal. No doubt of it.</p>
          <p>Soc. And is not restraining a man from what he desires <lb/>
            correcting him ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. Then correction or restraint is better for the soul <lb/>
            than unrestrained self-indulgence, as you thought just now.</p>
          <p>Cal. I don't know what you are talking about, Socra- <lb/>
            tes ? do pray put your questions to some one else.</p>
          <p>Soc. Here's a man that can't bear to have a service done <lb/>

            Well it seems it must absolutely be so. Still if we are to do <lb/>
            this, my own opinion is that we ought all of us to vie with <lb/>
            one another in trying to discover what is true and what <lb/>
            is false in this matter that we are discussing, for it is a <lb/>

            neither do I myself say what I say as having any certain <lb/>

            check me as you listen whenever you think me wrong. And <lb/>

          <p>Cal. Go on, my good sir, by yourself, and make an <lb/>
            end of it.</p>
          <p>Soc. Then listen to me whilst I resume the argument <note type="margin"> c. 62 </note> <lb/>
            from the beginning. Are pleasure and good the same thing? <lb/>
            Not the same, as Callicles and I agreed. Is pleasure to be <lb/>
            pursued for the sake of the good, or good for the sake of <lb/>
            pleasure ? Pleasure for the sake of the good. And is that <lb/>
            pleasant which brings pleasure by its presence, and that good <lb/>
            which by its presence makes us good ? Just so. But further, <lb/>
            we ourselves, as well as every thing else that is good, have that <lb/>
            character by the acquisition of some virtue or other ? In my <lb/>
            opinion, Callicles, that is necessarily so. But to be sure the <lb/>
            virtue of every thing, whether it be implement or body, or <lb/>
            again soul or any living creature whatsoever, cannot be ac- <lb/>
            quired best by accident; it must be due to that particular <lb/>
            order and rightness and art which is assigned severally to <lb/>
            each of them. Is that so ? That is certainly my opinion. So <lb/>
            then the virtue of everything implies order and harmonious <lb/>
            arrangement ? I should say so. In everything then it is by <lb/>
            the introduction of some kind of order, that viz. which is <lb/>
            proper to each, that this is in every case made good ? I <lb/>
            think so. Consequently a soul also when it has its own <lb/>
            proper order and harmony is better than one which is devoid <lb/>
            of order? Necessarily. But further one which is endowed <lb/>
            with order is orderly ? Of course it is. And the orderly <note type="chapter">507 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="102"/>
            soul is ‘temperate’ ? Beyond all doubt. Consequently the <lb/>
            temperate soul is good. I have nothing to say to the con- <lb/>
            trary, my dear Callicles : but if you have, pray inform us.</p>
          <p>Cal. Go on, my good sir.</p>
          <p>Soc. I proceed then to say, that if the temperate soul is <lb/>
            good, that which has the properties contrary to temperance <lb/>
            or soundness of mind1 is bad : and that was one that is <lb/>
            devoid of sense and self-control? No doubt. And further <lb/>
            the man of sound mind will do what is right towards gods <lb/>
            and men? for no man could be sound in mind if he did the <lb/>
            contrary ? This must needs be so. And again when he does <lb/>
            what is right and proper towards men, his actions will be just, <lb/>
            and towards the gods pious; but a man who does what is <lb/>
            just and pious must needs be a just and pious man ? It is so. <lb/>
            And to be sure he must be brave too: for certainly temperance <lb/>
            or self-control consists not in pursuing or avoiding what' one <lb/>
            ought not, but in pursuing and avoiding what one ought, <lb/>
            whether things or men, or pleasures or pains, and in stedfast <lb/>
            endurance at the call of duty. So that we may be fully <lb/>
            convinced, Callicles, that the ' temperate' man, as our argu- <lb/>
            ment has shown, being just and brave and pious has attained <lb/>
            the perfection of goodness, and that the good man does well <lb/>
            and fairly all that he does, and that he that does well is <lb/>
            blessed and happy, and the bad man and evil doer wretched. <lb/>
            And this must be the man who is in the opposite condition <lb/>
            (of mind) to the temperate, the licentious namely, whom <lb/>
            you were applauding.</p>
          <p><note type="margin"> c. 63 </note> Such then is the view that I take of these matters, and <lb/>
            this I assert to be the truth; and if it be true, that every one, <lb/>
            as it appears, who desires to be happy must seek after and <lb/>
            practise self-control, and flee from licentiousness, every one <note type="footnote"> 1 The virtue <foreign xml:lang="grc">σωφροσύνη</foreign> here appears in a new aspect, that of souudminded- <lb/>

            it, either himself or any of those connected with him, be it <lb/>
            individual or state, then justice must be applied and cor- <lb/>
            rection, if he is to have any chance of happiness. Such <lb/>
            seems to me to be the aim which a man should keep in view <lb/>
            through life, and so act as to concentrate all his own efforts <lb/>
            as well as those of the state upon this one object, that justice <lb/>
            and temperance may be essential to the attainment of hap- <lb/>
            piness, not letting his desires grow without restraint, and so <lb/>
            in the attempt to satisfy them, a never-ending torment, <lb/>
            leading the life of a robber. For neither to any man else1 <lb/>
            can such an one be dear, nor to God; for he is incapable of <lb/>
            fellowship, but with one in whom there is no fellowship <lb/>
            friendship is impossible. And, Callicles, the heaven and <lb/>
            'he earth and gods and men, as the wise tell us, are kept <note type="chapter"> 508 </note> <lb/>
            together by fellowship and friendship and orderliness and <lb/>
            temperance and justice, and this is why, my friend, they give <lb/>
            the name of ' order' to yonder universe and not of disorder <lb/>
            or licence (unrestraint). But you it seems have not paid <lb/>
            attention to this, clever as you are, but have overlooked the <lb/>
            mighty power of geometrical equality2 in heaven as well as <lb/>
            earth. You suppose that a spirit of inequality, the desire of <lb/>
            obtaining more than one's fair share, is what ought to be cul- <lb/>
            tivated ; because you don't care for geometry. Well. Either <lb/>
            then we must refute this argument that it is by the posses- <lb/>
            sion of justice and self-control that the happy are happy, <lb/>
            and by that of vice that the wretched are wretched; or if <lb/>
            this be true, we must consider what are its consequences. <lb/>
            All those former results follow, Callicles, about which you <lb/>
            asked me if I was in earnest, when I said that a man should <lb/>
            accuse himself or his son or friend if he do wrong, and that <lb/>
            this is what rhetoric should be used for. And what you sup- <note type="footnote"> 1 " Of all men else I have avoided thee." Macbeth. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 That is, proportion: which assigns to every man what is his due in accord- <lb/>

            posed Polus to concede out of mere shame was true after all, <lb/>
            that to do wrong is worse than to suffer it in the same pro- <lb/>
            portion as it is baser : and that any one who means to be a <lb/>
            rhetorician in any true sense of the word must after all be <lb/>
            a just man, and fully acquainted with the principles of <lb/>
            justice, which again Polus said that Gorgias was forced by <lb/>
            shame to admit.</p>
          <p><note type="margin"> c. 64 </note> This being the case, let us consider what amount of truth <lb/>
            there really is in all that you taunt me with; that I am un- <lb/>
            able to help myself or any of my friends or connections, or <lb/>
            to rescue them from the greatest dangers; and that, like the <lb/>
            outlaws who are at every one's mercy, I am in the power of <lb/>
            any one that chooses to slap me in the face, according to your <lb/>
            truly spirited expression, or rob me of my property, or expel <lb/>
            me from the city, or, worst of all, put me to death: and to be <lb/>
            in such a condition is according to your account the very worst <lb/>
            of all infamies. But my view you know-and though it has <lb/>
            been already repeatedly stated, yet there is no reason why it <lb/>
            should not be repeated once more—(is this): I deny, Callicles, <lb/>
            that to be slapt on the cheek wrongfully is the worst of all <lb/>
            disgrace, or to have my purse cut or my person; but I say <lb/>
            that to strike or wound me or mine wrongfully is more dis- <lb/>
            graceful and worse: aye and stealing besides and kidnapping <lb/>
            and housebreaking, and in a word any wrong whatsoever <lb/>
            done to me or mine, is worse and more disgraceful to the <lb/>
            doer of the wrong than to me who suffer it. All this, which <lb/>
            has already been brought before us in an earlier part of our <note type="chapter"> 509 </note> <lb/>
            discourse in the way that now I state it, is bound down and <lb/>
            fastened-though the expression may appear somewhat too <lb/>
            strong1—with arguments of iron and adamant, as it would <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγροικότερον</foreign> is literally too rude or coarse, ill-bred or ill-mannered.' <lb/>
            This coarseness and want of good breeding may be shown in the expression, <lb/>
            either by the absence of refinement and delicacy, in which case the word <lb/>
            means, too broad, not sufficiently guarded or reserved, or 'too strong' as I <lb/>
            have rendered it; or by a want of modesty, an undue arrogance or presump- <lb/>
            tion, as Stallbaum understands it-which in fact does not materially differ <lb/>
            from the other. Schleiermacher has ‘derb’ 'harsh.' </note> <lb/>

            seem at any rate on the face of it; which you, or some still <lb/>
            more gallant and enterprising spirit than yourself, must an- <lb/>
            swer, or else you will find it impossible to speak aright upon <lb/>
            the subject in any other language than that which I now use. <lb/>
            For I for my part always say the same, that I am ignorant of <lb/>
            the true nature and bearings of these things, and yet of all <lb/>
            that I have ever encountered as now none has ever been able to <lb/>
            maintain any other views without making himself ridiculous. <lb/>
            Well then I assume again that it is as I say. But if it be so, <lb/>
            and injustice is the greatest of all evils to the wrong doer, <lb/>
            and still greater than this greatest, if that be possible, to do <lb/>
            wrong with impunity, what sort of help is that which a man <lb/>
            must be able to render to himself on pain of being really <lb/>
            ridiculous? is it not that which will avert from us the greatest <lb/>
            mischief? Nay surely this must needs be the kind of help <lb/>
            which it is most disgraceful1 not to be able to render to one's <lb/>
            self or one's friends or connections, and second to it the in- <lb/>
            ability to avert the second degree of evil, and the third the <lb/>
            third, and so forth; in proportion to the magnitude of each <lb/>
            kind of evil, so likewise is the glory of being able to find help <lb/>
            against each sort, and the disgrace of failure. Is it so, Calli- <lb/>
            cles, or otherwise?</p>
          <p>Cal. Not otherwise.</p>
          <p>Soc. Then of the two, doing and suffering wrong, we prc- <note type="margin"> c. 65</note> <lb/>
            nounce doing wrong to be the greater, and suffering it the <lb/>
            lesser evil. What provision then must a man make for help- <lb/>
            ing himself in order to secure both of these advantages, those <lb/>
            namely which arise from not doing and not suffering wrong? <lb/>
            Is it power or will ? What I mean is this. Will a man escape <lb/>
            suffering wrong by merely wishing not to suffer it, or will he <lb/>
            escape it by procuring power to avert it? <note type="footnote">1 Plato has here fallen into a not uncommon error in expressing himself- <lb/>

            makes Socrates say ‘ the most shameful help to be unable to render,' whereas <lb/>
            it is the inability or failure that is shameful and not the help. This blunder <lb/>
            I have, with some misgivings, corrected in the translation. </note> <pb n="106"/>
            </p>
          <p>Cal. Oh that's plain enough, by power.</p>
          <p>Soc. But what say you to doing wrong? Is the mere <lb/>
            wish to avoid injustice sufficient for a man, because in that <lb/>
            case he wont do it? or again to effect this must some kind of <lb/>
            power or art be provided, because if he do not learn and <lb/>
            practise it he will do wrong? This is a point on which I par- <lb/>
            ticularly want your answer, Callicles, so tell me at once <lb/>
            whether you think there was any real necessity or not for <lb/>
            Polus and me to admit as we did in the foregoing argument <lb/>
            that no one desires to do wrong, but all that do wrong do it <lb/>
            against their will.</p>
          <p><note type="chapter"> 510 </note> Cal. Let it be as you please, Socrates, that you may get <lb/>
            your argument finished.</p>
          <p>Soc. Then for this purpose again, it seems, we must pro- <lb/>
            vide ourselves with some kind of power or art, to avoid doing <lb/>
            wrong.</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes by all means.</p>
          <p>Soc. Then what may be the art that supplies the means <lb/>
            of suffering no wrong at all or as little as possible? See if <lb/>
            you agree with me as to what it is. For in my opinion it is <lb/>
            this: one must either be a ruler-or indeed a tyrant-in <lb/>
            one's state, or else a friend of the existing government.</p>
          <p>Cal. I hope you observe, Socrates, how ready I am to <lb/>
            praise you when you say anything that deserves it. This <lb/>
            seems to me to be extremely well said.</p>
          <p><note type="margin"> c. 66 </note> Soc. Then see if you think this well said too. It seems <lb/>
            to me that the strongest bond of friendship between man and <lb/>
            man is that which the wise men of old tell us of; 'like to <lb/>
            like.' Don't you agree with me?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes I do.</p>
          <p>Soc. And so where a savage and illiterate ruler is lord <lb/>
            and master, if there were any one in the city far better than <lb/>
            he, the tyrant it may be presumed would be afraid of him <lb/>
            and never could possibly become his friend with his whole <lb/>
            heart?</p>
          <p>Cal. It is so.</p><pb n="107"/>
            
          <p>Soc. Nor again the friend of one who was far inferior <lb/>
            to himself, any more than the other; for the tyrant would <lb/>
            despise him, and never treat him with the attention due to a <lb/>
            friend.</p>
          <p>Cal. That is true too.</p>
          <p>Soc. So then the only friend worth speaking of that is <lb/>
            left for such an one is the man who resembling him in cha- <lb/>
            racter, blaming and praising the same things, chooses to sub- <lb/>
            mit to his authority, and to be subject to him as his ruler. <lb/>
            He it is that will have power in such a state, him none will <lb/>
            wrong with impunity. Is it not so?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. Accordingly if in such a city as this one of the <lb/>
            young men were to reflect within himself-how can I acquire <lb/>
            great power and no one do me wrong?—he has the same <lb/>
            path it seems to follow, to accustom himself from his very <lb/>
            earliest years to feel delight and displeasure in the same <lb/>
            things as his master, and to make himself as nearly as pos- <lb/>
            sible like the other: hasn't he?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. And so he will establish for himself a lasting1 im- <lb/>
            munity from suffering wrong, and to use your own language, <lb/>
            great power in the city.</p>
          <p>Cal. No doubt of it.</p>
          <p>Soc. And from doing wrong too? or quite the contrary, <lb/>
            if he is to resemble the wicked governor and acquire great <lb/>
            influence with him? Nay I should think that his efforts will <lb/>
            be directed to the exact opposite, to the acquisition that is of <lb/>
            the power of doing as much wrong as possible, and escaping <lb/>
            the penalty for all the wrong that he does. Wont they?</p>
          <p>Cal. It seems so.</p>
          <p>Soc. So then the greatest of all evils will befal him, to <note type="chapter"> 511 </note> <lb/>
            have his soul depraved and deformed by the imitation of his <lb/>
            master and the power that he has acquired. <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">διαπεπράξεται</foreign>, Matth. Gr. Gr. § 498. </note> <pb n="108"/>
            </p>
          <p>Cal. You have the oddest way, Socrates, of twisting ar- <lb/>
            guments every now and then and turning them upside down. <lb/>
            Don't you know that this imitator, as you call him, will put <lb/>
            to death any one that does not imitate him if he pleases, or <lb/>
            strip him of all he possesses?</p>
          <p>Soc. Indeed I do, my worthy Callicles, if I am not deaf, <lb/>
            so often have I heard it from you and Polus of late, and in- <lb/>
            deed from nearly every body else in the city. But now do <lb/>
            you in your turn hear what I have to say, that he may kill <lb/>
            me if he pleases, but it will be a villain killing an honest <lb/>
            man.</p>
          <p>Cal. Well and isn't this the very thing that arouses <lb/>
            one's indignation?</p>
          <p>Soc. Not in a man of sense, as our argument indicates. <lb/>
            You don't think, do you, that the object of all a man's efforts <lb/>
            should be to live as long as possible, and to study those arts <lb/>
            which preserve us from dangers; like that for instance which <lb/>
            you bid me study, the art of rhetoric, which ensures us safety <lb/>
            in courts of justice?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes indeed I do, and very good advice it is.</p>
          <p><note type="margin"> c. 67 </note> Soc. Well but, my excellent friend, do you think the art <lb/>
            of swimming a very dignified one?</p>
          <p>Cal. No faith not I.</p>
          <p>Soc. And yet that too saves men from death when any <lb/>
            accident happens to them in which the knowledge of the art <lb/>
            is required. But if this appears to you of too trivial a cha- <lb/>
            racter, I'll mention to you another of more importance than <lb/>
            this, the art of navigation, which not only saves men's lives, <lb/>
            but their bodies too and goods from the extremest perils, just <lb/>
            like rhetoric. And yet this is modest and sober, and does <lb/>
            not give itself airs, and throw itself into attitudes, as if it <lb/>
            were performing some very extraordinary feat: but for a ser- <lb/>
            vice at least equal to that of the art forensic, for conveying <lb/>
            one safe home, it may be from Ægina, it asks a fee I dare say <lb/>
            of a couple of obols; or if it be from Egypt or the Pontus, at <lb/>
            the utmost in return for this important service, for carrying <lb/>
             <pb n="109"/>
            safe as I said just now self and children and goods and <lb/>
            women (i. e. female slaves and their mistress), when it has <lb/>
            landed them all in the harbour its fare is a couple of drach- <lb/>
            mas : and the possessor of the art himself after he has done <lb/>
            all this gets out and takes his walk by the shore alongside of <lb/>
            his vessel with a perfectly unassuming demeanour. For he <lb/>
            knows I dare say how to take into account that it is quite <lb/>
            uncertain which of his passengers he has done a service to <lb/>
            by saving them from drowning, and which of them he has <lb/>
            injured, fully aware that he has landed them not a bit better <lb/>
            than they were when they went on board in body or soul. <note type="chapter"> 512 </note> <lb/>
            He reflects accordingly that it cannot be that a man who has <lb/>
            escaped drowning whilst he labours under the affliction of <lb/>
            great and incurable bodily diseases is miserable in that he <lb/>
            has been preserved from death, and has received no benefit <lb/>
            from him at all-and yet that one who is laden with many <lb/>
            incurable diseases in that which is so much more precious <lb/>
            than the body-in the soul-that he, I say, should be allowed <lb/>
            to live on, and that he did him service in rescuing him <lb/>
            whether it be from the sea or a lawcourt or anywhere else <lb/>
            you please- No, he knows that it is better for man in a <lb/>
            vicious state not to live, for he must needs live ill.</p>
          <p>This is why it is not the fashion for the pilot to give him- <note type="margin"> c. 68</note> <lb/>
            self airs, though he does save our lives. No nor the (military) <lb/>
            engineer either, my worthy friend, though he has sometimes <lb/>
            the power of saving lives just as much as a general-to say <lb/>
            nothing of a pilot-or any one else. For sometimes he saves <lb/>
            whole cities. Think you he is to be compared with the <lb/>
            lawyer ? And yet if he chose to talk and magnify his busi- <lb/>
            ness as you do, Callicles, he might overwhelm you with his <lb/>
            words, arguing and urging upon you the duty of making <lb/>
            yourselves engineers, for there is nothing else like it: for <lb/>
            he would have plenty to say for himself. Still you none the <lb/>
            less look down upon him and his art, and as a term of re- <lb/>
            proach would nickname him the machine maker,' and you <lb/>
            wouldn't consent to bestow your daughter upon his son, <lb/>
             <pb n="110"/>
            nor to take his yourself for your own. And yet on the <lb/>
            principles upon which you extol your own pursuits, what <lb/>
            fair excuse have you for despising the engineer and all the <lb/>
            rest that I just now mentioned ? I know you would say that <lb/>
            you are a better man and better born. But if better' does <lb/>
            not mean what I say it does ; if virtue means this and <lb/>
            nothing more, to save one's self and what belongs to one, <lb/>
            whatever one's character may chance to be, your contempt <lb/>
            for the engineer and the physician and all the other arts <lb/>
            which have been invented with the object of saving men's <lb/>
            lives becomes ridiculous. Nay, my dear fellow, see to it, <lb/>
            whether the noble and the good be not something quite <lb/>
            different from saving and being saved.</p>
          <p>Consider whether the true man ought not to disregard <lb/>
            this, I mean any particular length of life1, and to renounce all <lb/>
            love of mere life; ought not rather to leave all this to the will <lb/>
            of heaven, and, believing what the women say that no one <lb/>
            can escape his destiny, consider hereupon how he may best <note type="chapter"> 513 </note> <lb/>
            pass his allotted portion of life ; whether it be in assimilating <lb/>
            himself to any form of government under which he may hap- <lb/>
            pen to live, and so now accordingly, whether you are bound <lb/>
            to make yourself as like as possible to the Athenian people, <lb/>
            if you mean to gain its affections and acquire great power in <lb/>
            the city. Consider whether this is really beneficial to you and <lb/>
            me, that we mayn’t meet with the fate of the Thessalian <lb/>
            women who draw down the moon from heaven 2: upon the <note type="footnote"> 1 I have here, for once, abandoned the Zurich text which is adopted by <lb/>
            Stallbaum, and followed the old reading retained by Heindorf, Buttmann, <lb/>

            able opposition between <foreign xml:lang="grc">του̂το μὲν τὸ ξη̂ν</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁπόσον δὲ χρόνον</foreign>, and that the <lb/>

            explanation rests mainly upon his interpretation of <foreign xml:lang="grc">δέ</foreign> by ‘immo ;’ but he would <lb/>
            have found it difficult to produce another example of the particle used with <lb/>

            choice of this power in the state our dearest interests will be <lb/>
            staked. But if you suppose that any one in the world can <lb/>
            impart to you such an art as will raise you to great power in <lb/>
            the state without being like the government either for the <lb/>
            better or worse, it seems to me, Callicles, that you are very <lb/>
            ill advised : for you must be not a mere imitator but radi- <lb/>
            cally like them, if you mean to effect any thing genuine in <lb/>
            the way of friendship with Demus the Athenian people, aye <lb/>
            faith and with Demus the son of Pyrilampes to boot. Who- <lb/>
            ever therefore shall produce in you the nearest possible <lb/>
            resemblance to them, he it is that will make you a states- <lb/>
            man, in the sense in which you desire to be a statesman, and <lb/>
            a rhetorician : for with words accommodated to their own <lb/>
            character every body is pleased, but such as are adapted to a <lb/>
            foreign one they dislike-unless you have any thing to say <lb/>
            to the contrary, my darling. Have we (insinuatingly) any- <lb/>
            thing to say! against all this, Callicles?</p>
          <p>Cal. Some how or other, Socrates, there seems to me to <note type="margin"> c. 69 </note> <lb/>
            be truth in what you say. But I feel as most people do, I <lb/>
            don't quite believe you.</p>
          <p>Soc. That's because the love of Demus has planted itself <lb/>
            in your soul and resists me, Callicles; but if perhaps we were <lb/>
            to examine these same questions often over again and better, <lb/>
            you'd be convinced. Remember however that we said that <lb/>
            there are two processes which may be adopted in training <lb/>
            anything, whether body or soul, one to make its pleasure the <lb/>
            object of all our dealings with it; the other what is best for <lb/>
            it, not humouring it, but striving against it to the utter- <lb/>
            most. This is the distinction that we drew before, is it not ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes, certainly.</p>
          <p>Soc. Well then, the one, that which is directed to plea- <lb/>
            sure, is ignoble and nothing but flattery, is it not ?</p>
          <p>Calf Be it so, if you please.</p>
          <p>Soc. And of the other the object is to make that which <note type="footnote"> 1 Read <foreign xml:lang="grc">λέγομεν</foreign> with v. 1. and Stallbaum. The Zur. Edd. give <foreign xml:lang="grc">λέγωμεν</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="112"/>
            we have charge of, whether it be body or soul, as good as <lb/>
            possible?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes, no doubt.</p>
          <p>Soc. Ought not then our object to be in undertaking <lb/>
            the care of our city and its citizens to make them as good as <lb/>
            possible? For without this, you know, as we found in our <lb/>
            preceding argument, there is no use in offering any other <note type="chapter"> 514 </note> <lb/>
            kind of service, unless, that is, the thoughts and intentions <lb/>
            of those who are to acquire either wealth or authority over <lb/>
            others or any other kind of power be honest and virtuous. <lb/>
            Are we to assume this?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes, by all means, if you prefer it.</p>
          <p>Soc. Supposing then that you and I, Callicles, in the <lb/>
            ordinary course of public business1, were inviting one another <lb/>
            to undertake the building department, the most important <lb/>
            structures it may be of walls or docks or temples, would it <lb/>
            have been our duty to consider and examine ourselves, first <lb/>
            of all whether we are acquainted or not with the art of build- <lb/>
            ing, and from whom we learnt it? would it, or not?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes no doubt.</p>
          <p>Soc. And again, in the second place, whether we have <lb/>
            ever erected any building for private use, either for one of <lb/>
            our friends or ourselves, and whether this building is hand- <lb/>
            some or ugly? And if we found upon consideration that we <lb/>
            had had good and well-reputed masters, and that many hand- <lb/>
            some buildings had been erected by us under our masters' <lb/>
            direction, and many by ourselves of our own, after we had <lb/>
            parted from our masters; under such circumstances men of <lb/>
            sense might be permitted to undertake public works; but if <lb/>
            we had no master of ourselves to produce, and of buildings <lb/>
            either none at all, or ever so many and all worthless, surely <note type="footnote"> 1 The aorist participle <foreign xml:lang="grc">πράξαντες</foreign> denotes, as Stallbaum observes, quod quis <lb/>
            jam facere instituit. It would be more fully rendered by the addition of the <lb/>
            words 'in which we had engaged' or something equivalent; but as this is <lb/>
            rather too long for the translation of a single participle, I have endeavoured <lb/>
            to express the notion by the words ordinary course.’ </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="113"/>
            in this case it would be the height of folly to attempt public <lb/>
            works, and invite one another to undertake them. May we <lb/>
            pronounce this to be correct, or not?</p>
          <p>Gal. Yes, certainly.</p>
          <p>Soc. And similarly with the rest; supposing for in- <note type="margin"> c. 70</note> <lb/>
            stance we had undertaken the office of state-physicians, and <lb/>
            were inviting one another to it as thoroughly well qualified <lb/>
            for the task, our first step would be, I presume, to examine <lb/>
            one another's qualifications, you mine and I yours. Marry <lb/>
            now, let us see, how stands the case. with Socrates in regard <lb/>
            of the health of his own body? or has any one else, slave or <lb/>
            free man, ever yet been cured of a disease by means of <lb/>
            Socrates ? And I again, I dare say, should have made exactly <lb/>
            similar inquiries about you. And if we found that we had <lb/>
            never been the means of making any one better in his bodily <lb/>
            health, citizen or stranger, man or woman, in heaven's name, <lb/>
            Callicles, would it not be truly absurd that human beings <lb/>
            should ever be brought to such a pitch of folly as to begin <lb/>
            with the wine-jar in learning the potter's art, as the saying <lb/>
            is, you know, and before they had in their private practice, <lb/>
            often failing it may be, and often succeeding, exercised them- <lb/>
            selves sufficiently in the art, undertake to serve publicly as <lb/>
            physicians themselves and invite others like them to do the <lb/>
            same? Don't you think it would be folly to act so?</p>
          <p>Gal. Yes I do.</p>
          <p>Soc. And now, my excellent friend, as you yourself are <note type="chapter"> 515 </note> <lb/>
            just beginning to enter into public life, and are urging me to <lb/>
            do the same, and reproaching me for not doing it, shall we <lb/>
            not examine one another, as thus, Let us see, has Callicles <lb/>
            ever yet made any of the citizens better than he was before? <lb/>
            Is there any one of them who was before wicked, unjust and <lb/>
            licentious and foolish, and by Callicles' means has been made <lb/>
            an honest man, stranger or citizen, bond or free? Tell me, <lb/>
            Callicles, if any one examines you thus, what will you say? <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">τά τε ἄλλα, καί</foreign> ... </note> <note type="footnote"> 8 </note> <lb/>

            What human creature will you claim to have improved <lb/>
            by his intercourse with you? Do you hesitate to answer, if <lb/>
            you have anything to show which you have done in your <lb/>
            private capacity as a preliminary to engaging in public <lb/>
            business ?</p>
          <p>Cal. You are captious, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Soc. Nay it is not out of captiousness that I put the <lb/>
            question but from a real wish to know what you think your <lb/>
            duty as a public man is in our city, whether, that is to say, <lb/>
            we shall find you (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡμ</foreign>î<foreign xml:lang="grc">ν</foreign>) concerning yourself about anything <lb/>
            else in your administration but making us citizens as good as <lb/>
            possible. We have already several times admitted, haven't <lb/>
            we, that this is the statesman's proper business? Have we <lb/>
            admitted it or not? Answer me. We have; I will answer <lb/>
            for you. If then this is what a good man is bound to effect <lb/>
            for his native city, now call to mind those men whom you <lb/>
            mentioned just now, Pericles, and Cimon, and Miltiades, and <lb/>
            Themistocles, and tell me if you still think that they ap- <lb/>
            proved themselves good citizens.</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes I do.</p>
          <p>Soc. Well then if they were good, it is plain that every <lb/>
            one of them made the citizens better than they were before. <lb/>
            Did they do so, or not?</p>
          <p>Cal. They did.</p>
          <p>Soc. Accordingly when Pericles began to speak before <lb/>
            the People the Athenians were worse than when he made his <lb/>
            last speeches?</p>
          <p>Cal. Perhaps.</p>
          <p>Soc. Not perhaps at all, my very good sir: it follows <lb/>
            necessarily from our admissions, if at least he was a good <lb/>
            statesman.</p>
          <p>Cal. Well what then?</p>
          <p>Soc. Oh nothing. Only just tell me this as well, whether <lb/>
            the Athenians are commonly said to have owed any improve- <lb/>
            ment to Pericles, or just the contrary, to have been corrupted <lb/>
            by him. For what I hear is this, that Pericles has made the <lb/>
             <pb n="115"/>
            Athenians lazy and cowardly and talkative and greedy, by <lb/>
            establishing first the system of fees.</p>
          <p>Cal. You hear all that from those broken-nosed 1 gentry, <lb/>
            Socrates.</p>
          <p>Soc. Aye but this I don't hear merely, but know full <lb/>
            well, and so do you, that first of all Pericles was popular with <lb/>
            the Athenians, who never passed a sentence upon him in- <lb/>
            volving any disgrace as long as they were ‘vorse;’ but as <lb/>
            soon as they had been made by him thoroughly honest and <note type="chapter"> 516 </note> <lb/>
            good men, at the end of Pericles' life they found him guilty <lb/>
            of peculation, and nearly condemned him to death-plainly <lb/>
            because they thought him a rogue.</p>
          <p>Gal. What then? did that make Pericles a bad man? <note type="margin"> c. 72 </note> </p>
          <p>Soc. At all events a herdsman of that sort who had <lb/>
            the care of asses or horses or oxen would be thought a bad <lb/>
            one, if the animals which he took under his charge free <lb/>
            from all propensity to kick or butt or bite turned out <lb/>
            under his management given to all these tricks out of <lb/>
            mere wildness. You would call, wouldn't you, any keeper <lb/>
            of any animal whatsoever a bad one who makes those <lb/>
            which he has received under his charge tame and gentle <lb/>
            wilder than they were when he took them? Would you <lb/>
            do so or not?</p>
          <p>Cal. Oh yes, by all means, to oblige you.</p>
          <p>Soc. Then oblige me still further by answering this one <lb/>
            question whether man too is one of the animal creation or <lb/>
            no?</p>
          <p>Cal. Of course he is.</p>
          <p>Soc. And had not Pericles the charge of man ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. Well then, ought they not, as we agreed just now, <note type="footnote"> 1 I have here taken a liberty with the Greek text by substituting the nose, <lb/>

            said1. But what say you? Is it not so?</p>

            than they were when he took them in hand, and that against <lb/>
            himself, the very case in which he would least have desired it.</p>
          <p>Cal. Do you want me to agree with you?</p>
          <p>Soc. Yes if you think I speak the truth.</p>
          <p>Cal. Then let it be as you say.</p>
          <p>Soc. And accordingly if wilder, more unjust and worse.</p>
          <p>Cal. Be it so.</p>
          <p>Soc. So then it follows from what we have said that <lb/>
            Pericles was not a good statesman.</p>
          <p>Cal. So you say.</p>
          <p>Soc. Faith and so must you say too, after the admissions <lb/>
            you just made. And now again about Cimon, tell me; did <lb/>
            not those whom he tended ostracise him in order that they <lb/>
            mightn’t hear the sound of his voice for ten years? And <lb/>
            didn't they treat Themistocles in the very same way, and <lb/>
            punish him with exile to boot? and Miltiades the hero of <lb/>
            Marathon they sentenced to be thrown into the pit, and had <lb/>
            it not been for the president into it he would have been <lb/>
            thrown. And yet these men had they been good in the way <lb/>
            that you describe them, would never have been treated thus. <lb/>
            At all events good drivers don't keep their seat in the chariot <lb/>
            at the commencement of their career, and then get thrown <lb/>
            out after they have trained their horses and improved them- <lb/>
            selves in driving. This is not the case either in charioteering or <lb/>
            in any other business whatsoever. You don't think so, do you?</p>
          <p>Cal. No, not I.</p>
          <p><note type="chapter"> 517 </note> Soc. So then what we said before was true, that we know <note type="footnote"> 1 Odyss. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξ</foreign>'. no. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="117"/>
            no one who has approved himself a good statesman in this <lb/>
            city of ours. You admitted this of the men of the present <lb/>
            day, but (urged that) some of those of former times (were en- <lb/>
            titled to be so regarded), and to these men you gave the pre- <lb/>
            ference. But these now turn out to be on a par with the men <lb/>
            of the present day; and therefore if these were orators, they <lb/>
            employed neither the genuine art of rhetoric, else they would <lb/>
            not have lost the popular favour, nor the flattering sort of it.</p>
          <p>Cal. But surely, Socrates, none of the present generation <note type="margin"> c. 73 </note> <lb/>
            has ever done anything like such deeds as one of those others, <lb/>
            any one of them you please.</p>
          <p>Soc. My dear sir, neither do I find any fault with them, <lb/>
            at least as ministers in the state's service, on the contrary I <lb/>
            think they have shown themselves more dexterous ministers <lb/>
            than the men of our time, and better able to provide the city <lb/>
            with all that she desired. However in changing the direction <lb/>
            of the citizens' desires instead of giving way to them, leading <lb/>
            them by persuasion or compulsion to that which would im- <lb/>
            prove their character, in all this so to speak these were in no <lb/>
            respect superior to the others: and yet this is the only busi- <lb/>
            ness of a good statesman. But as to providing ships and <lb/>
            walls and docks and a variety of other such-like things, I <lb/>
            grant you myself that these men were cleverer than the <lb/>
            others. So it seems you and I are doing an absurd thing in <lb/>
            this argument of ours. For during the whole time that our <lb/>
            conversation has lasted we have never ceased coming round <lb/>
            constantly to the same point and misunderstanding one an- <lb/>
            other's meaning. I at all events believe that you have ad- <lb/>
            mitted ever so many times and decided that this business of <lb/>
            dealing with either body or soul is two-fold, and that the one <lb/>
            of these is ministerial; whereby meat may be provided for <lb/>
            our bodies when they are hungry, and drink when they are <lb/>
            thirsty, and when cold clothing, bedding, shoes, or anything <lb/>
            else that bodies are led to desire. And I purposely use the <lb/>
            same images in my illustration that you may the more easily <lb/>
            understand me. For as to being capable of supplying such <lb/>
             <pb n="118"/>
            things, either as a shopkeeper or merchant, or maker of any <lb/>
            of the things themselves, baker or cook or weaver or shoe- <lb/>
            maker or tanner-it is no wonder, I say, that a man being <lb/>
            such should fancy himself and be considered by others as one <lb/>
            who takes care of the body; by every one, that is, who is not <lb/>
            aware that there is besides all these an art of medicine and <lb/>
            gymnastics which really is a training of the body; which has <lb/>
            in fact a natural claim to authority over all the arts, and a <lb/>
            right to make use of their works, because it knows what is good <lb/>
            and bad in meat and drink for promoting a perfect condition <note type="chapter"> 518 </note> <lb/>
            of body, of which all those others are ignorant; and so it is <lb/>
            that all these are servile and ministerial and illiberal in their <lb/>
            treatment of the body, I mean all the rest, and medicine and <lb/>
            gymnastics have a fair claim to be their mistresses. That I <lb/>
            maintain the very same to be the case with the soul you <lb/>
            seem to me at one time to understand, and admit it as though <lb/>
            you knew what I meant; and then by and by you come and <lb/>
            tell me that men in our city have shown themselves citizens <lb/>
            of sterling worth, and when I ask you who, you seem to me <lb/>
            to put forward men of exactly the same sort in statecraft, as <lb/>
            if when I asked you who are or ever have been good trainers <lb/>
            of the body in gymnastics you told me quite seriously, The- <lb/>
            arion the baker, and Mithæcus the author of the treatise on <lb/>
            Sicilian cookery, and Sarambus the vintner, these are they <lb/>
            that have shown marvellous skill in training men's bodies by <lb/>
            supplying the one admirable loaves, the second entrees, and <note type="margin"> c. 74</note> <lb/>
            the third wine. Now perhaps you would have been offended <lb/>
            if I had said to you, My friend, you know nothing at all <lb/>
            about gymnastics: you tell me of a parcel of fellows, ministers <lb/>
            and caterers to men's appetites, with no sound and true <lb/>
            knowledge of them whatever, who, very likely, will first stuff <lb/>
            and fatten men's bodies-applauded by them for it all the <lb/>
            while-and then make them lose even the flesh they had of <lb/>
            old. They in their turn from ignorance will not throw the <lb/>
            blame of their diseases and the loss of their old flesh upon <lb/>
            those who thus indulge them; but whoever happen to be <lb/>
             <pb n="119"/>
            near them at the time or to offer them any advice, just at <lb/>
            the moment when the original stuffing and pampering, car- <lb/>
            ried on as it was without the least regard to what is whole- <lb/>
            some, has at length, it may be ever so long after, brought <lb/>
            disease upon them, them they will accuse and find fault with <lb/>
            and do them a mischief if they can, whilst they will applaud <lb/>
            those earlier advisers, the real authors of the disaster. And <lb/>
            you, Callicles, are now doing something precisely similar: <lb/>
            you are applauding men who have indulged those charges of <lb/>
            theirs with all the good things that they desired. And <lb/>
            people say that they have made the city great: but that <lb/>
            it is mere swelling1 and internal ulceration that has been <lb/>
            brought about by these famous statesmen of old, they do <lb/>
            not perceive. For disregarding temperance and justice they <note type="chapter">519</note> <lb/>
            have stuffed the city with harbours and docks and walls and <lb/>
            tribute and suchlike nonsense: and so whenever the fit of sick- <lb/>
            ness we spoke of actually comes, they will lay the blame upon <lb/>
            their then present advisers, and applaud Themistocles and <lb/>
            Cimon and Pericles, the authors of all the mischief: and when <lb/>
            besides their subsequent acquisitions they have lost all that <lb/>
            they originally had into the bargain, they will probably lay <lb/>
            hold of you, if you don't take good care, and my friend Alci- <lb/>
            biades, who though not the immediate authors of all the <lb/>
            mischief are yet perhaps partly to blame for it. There is <lb/>
            however one senseless thing which I see happening now, and <lb/>
            hear of the men of the past generation. Whenever, that is, <lb/>
            the city takes one of these public men in hand as a wrong- <lb/>
            doer, I hear them venting their indignation with loud outcries <lb/>
            against such shameful treatment: ' so then after all their <lb/>
            long and valuable services to the city the return she makes is <lb/>
            injustice and ruin,' according to their story. But all this is <lb/>
            entirely false. For there is no single instance in which the <lb/>
            ruler of a city could ever be unjustly brought to ruin by the <note type="footnote">1 “Where great additions swell's and virtue none, <lb/>
            It is a dropsical honour." </note><note type="footnote"> All’s Well that ends Well, II. 3. 124. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="120"/>
            very city over which he bears rule. For the case appears to <lb/>
            be precisely the same with those that pretend to the name of <lb/>
            statesmen as with those who profess the sophistical art. The <lb/>
            sophists in fact with all their cleverness in everything else in <lb/>
            this one point arc guilty of an egregious absurdity: for <lb/>
            claiming to be teachers of virtue they often charge their <lb/>
            pupils with wronging them by cheating them of their fees <lb/>
            and in other respects showing them no gratitude for all <lb/>
            the service they have done them. Now what can be more <lb/>
            unreasonable than such language? That men after they have <lb/>
            been made good and just, after all their injustice has been <lb/>
            eradicated by their teacher and justice planted in its stead, <lb/>
            should commit injustice by means of that which they have <lb/>
            not. Does not this seem to you absurd, my friend? You <lb/>
            have really forced me to make quite a speech, Callicles, by <lb/>
            refusing to answer.</p>
          <p><note type="margin"> c. 75 </note> Cal. So you then pretend that you can't speak unless <lb/>
            some one answer you ?</p>
          <p>Soc. It seems I can. This time at any rate I have gone <lb/>
            on talking a good while, because you wont answer me. Come <lb/>
            now, my good fellow, tell me in the name of the god of <lb/>
            friendship, don't you think it is unreasonable for a man to <lb/>
            profess to have made another good, and then, after he has <lb/>
            been made by him and still is good, to find fault with him <lb/>
            for being bad ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes, I do think so.</p>
          <p>Soc. Well and you hear, don't you, those that profess to <lb/>
            train men in virtue say such things ?</p>
          <p><note type="chapter"> 520 </note> Cal. Yes I do. But what is to be said [what's the use of <lb/>
            talking] of such a worthless set of fellows ?</p>
          <p>Soc. And what is to be said of those who, pretending to <lb/>
            control the state and to take care that it be made as good <lb/>
            as possible, turn round upon her when the occasion arises, and <lb/>
            accuse her of being as bad as she can be ? Think you there <lb/>
            is any difference between these and the others? The sophist <lb/>
            and the orator, my dear fellow, are the same thing, or as <lb/>
             <pb n="121"/>
            nearly as possible alike, as I said to Polus. But you for want <lb/>
            of knowledge think the one, rhetoric, a very fine thing, and <lb/>
            the other you despise. Whereas in truth sophistic is a finer <lb/>
            thing than rhetoric, in proportion as legislation is superior <lb/>
            to the administration of justice, and gymnastics to medicine. <lb/>
            In fact for my own part I always thought that public speakers <lb/>
            and sophists were the only class of people who have no right <lb/>
            to find fault with the thing that they have themselves trained <lb/>
            for behaving ill to them; or else they must at the same time <lb/>
            by these very same words charge themselves as well with <lb/>
            having done no good to those that they pretend to benefit. <lb/>
            Is it not so?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes, quite so.</p>
          <p>Soc. Aye, and they alone might be expected according <lb/>
            to all probability to have the power of bestowing their ser- <lb/>
            vices freely without fee or reward, if what they say were <lb/>
            true. For a man when he has received any other benefit, as <lb/>
            for instance if he has been taught to run fast by a trainer, <lb/>
            might perhaps cheat him of his reward, supposing the trainer <lb/>
            gave him his services for nothing, and made no agreement <lb/>
            with him for a fee which was to be paid as nearly as possible <lb/>
            at the very moment of imparting to him the speed in ques- <lb/>
            tion: for it is not by slowness of foot I conceive that men <lb/>
            do wrong, but by injustice; isn't it?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. And so if any one removes from others this par- <lb/>
            ticular vice, that is injustice, he need never be afraid of <lb/>
            being unjustly treated; but this benefit alone can be bestow- <lb/>
            ed for nothing with security-supposing that is, that any <lb/>
            one really has the power of making men good. Is it not so?</p>
          <p>Cal. I allow it.</p>
          <p>Soc. This then, it appears, is the reason why there is no <note type="margin"> c. 76</note> <lb/>
            disgrace in taking money for giving advice of any other kind, <lb/>
            as about building or the rest of the arts.</p>
          <p>Cal. So it seems.</p>
          <p>Soc. But about this particular process of making a man <lb/>
             <pb n="122"/>
            as good as possible, and enabling him to manage to the best <lb/>
            advantage his own household or a state, it is reckoned dis- <lb/>
            graceful to refuse to give advice without receiving money <lb/>
            for it. Isn't it?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. The reason plainly being this, that this is the only <lb/>
            kind of service that makes the recipient desire to requite the <lb/>
            benefit; and therefore the symptom seems a favourable one <lb/>
            [of something having been really taught], when any one after <lb/>
            having performed this particular service is repaid for it; and <lb/>
            if not, the contrary [an unfavourable one]. Is this as I say ?</p>
          <p><note type="chapter"> 521 </note> Cal. It is.</p>
          <p>Soc. Then tell me definitely which of those two modes <lb/>
            of serving the state it is that you invite rile to? that of <lb/>
            carrying on a constant struggle with the Athenians, like a <lb/>
            physician, to make them as good as possible, or (of behaving) <lb/>
            as one that would minister to all their humours and deal <lb/>
            with them solely with a view to their gratification? Tell me <lb/>
            the truth, Callicles: for you are bound, as you began by <lb/>
            speaking your mind so freely to me, to go on now and tell <lb/>
            me all that you think. So now pray speak out fairly and <lb/>
            frankly.</p>
          <p>Cal. I say then, as one that would minister to them.</p>
          <p>Soc. Then, my very ingenuous friend, you invite me to <lb/>
            play the flatterer.</p>
          <p>Cal. (angrily). You may call yourself a Mysian I, if you <lb/>
            like it better, Socrates; for if you don't do as I say- <note type="footnote"> 1 The proverb <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μυσω̂ λεία</foreign> is plainly not alluded to here, except so far as it <lb/>
            shows the low estimation in which the Mysians were held by the Greeks. The <lb/>
            proverb is explained by Aristotle, Rhet. I. 12. 20, to mean ' an easy prey,' and <lb/>
            is applied to <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοὺς ὑπὸ πολλω̂ν ἀδικηθέντας καὶ μὴ ἐπεξελθόντας</foreign> ; whence it ap- <lb/>
            pears that the Mysians were regarded as pusillanimous and feeble, unable to <lb/>
            protect themselves from injury or resent it when inflicted; and the national <lb/>
            designation of Mysian, like that of Carian, passed into a by-word and a term <lb/>
            of reproach. Socrates had implied in his last observation that if he took <lb/>
            Callicles' advice he should render himself liable to be called a flatterer; to this <lb/>
            Callicles angrily replies; you may call yourself something worse if you please, </note> <pb n="123"/>
            </p>
          <p>Soc. Don't repeat what you have said so often, that I <lb/>
            am at the mercy of any one that chooses to put me to death, <lb/>
            that I may not be obliged to repeat in my turn, that it will <lb/>
            be the case of a rogue putting to death an honest man: nor <lb/>
            that any one can strip me of all that I have, that I may not <lb/>
            be obliged to say in my turn, Well, but after he has done so, <lb/>
            he wont know how to use what he has got, but as he robbed <lb/>
            me wrongfully so in like manner he will employ wrongfully <lb/>
            what he has taken; and if wrongfully then basely; and if <lb/>
            basely then ill (mischievously, to his own detriment).</p>
          <p>Cal. It seems to me, Socrates, that you don't believe in <note type="margin"> c. 77</note> <lb/>
            the possibility of your meeting with any one of these calami- <lb/>
            ties, as though you were dwelling far out of harm's way, and <lb/>
            never could be dragged into a court of justice by some per- <lb/>
            haps utterly wretched 1 and contemptible fellow.</p>
          <p>Soc. Then I must indeed be a fool, Callicles, if I think <lb/>
            that in this city of ours any one whatsoever is exempt from <lb/>
            the risk of any possible form of calamity. Of this however I <lb/>
            am quite sure, that if I ever am brought before a court of <lb/>
            justice and incur any of those risks you speak of, it will be <lb/>
            some villain that brings me there: for no honest man would <lb/>
            ever prefer a criminal charge against an innocent person. Aye <lb/>
            and it were no marvel if I were condemned to death. Would <lb/>
            you have me tell you why I expect this?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes, by all means.</p>
          <p>Soc. I think that I am one of very few, not to say the <lb/>
            only man in all Athens, that attempts the true art of Politics, <lb/>
            and that I am the only man of the present day that performs <lb/>
            his public duties at all. Seeing then that the gratification of <lb/>
            my hearers is never the object of the discussions that I am <lb/>
            in the habit of taking part in, that they aim at what is best, <lb/>
            not what is most agreeable, and because I don't choose to do <lb/>
            those fine clever things that you recommend, I shall have not <note type="footnote"> a poor-spirited contemptible wretch, unable to protect or avenge yourself, like <lb/>

            a word to say before the tribunal. And the same case may <lb/>
            now be applied to me as I was describing to Polus: for I <lb/>
            shall be like a physician tried before a jury of children on a <lb/>
            charge brought by a cook. Only consider what defence a <lb/>
            man like this would make in such a predicament, if the <lb/>
            prosecutor were to open his case thus: My dears, here's a <lb/>
            man that has done you all (<foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ αὐτοὺς</foreign>) a vast deal of mischief, <lb/>
            and even the very youngest of you he maims for life by <note type="chapter"> 522 </note> <lb/>
            cutting and burning, and drives you to your wits' end by <lb/>
            starving and choking you, administering the bitterest draughts <lb/>
            and forcing you to abstain from eating and drinking; not <lb/>
            like me, who used to feast you with every variety of nice <lb/>
            things in abundance. What think you that a physician re- <lb/>
            duced to such a strait would find to say for himself? Or sup- <lb/>
            posing he were to say the truth, All this I did, my boys, for <lb/>
            your health—how great think you would be the outcry that <lb/>
            such judges would set up? a loud one, wouldn't it?</p>
          <p>Cal. I dare say : one would think so.</p>
          <p>Soc. Don't you suppose then that he would be utterly at <lb/>
            a loss what to say ?</p>
          <p>. Cal. Certainly he would. <note type="margin"> c. 78 </note> <lb/>
            Soc. Such however I well know would be my own fate <lb/>
            if I were brought before a court of justice. For I shall have <lb/>
            no pleasure to describe that I have provided for them ; which <lb/>
            they account as benefits and services-whereas I envy neither <lb/>
            those that procure them nor those for whom they are pro- <lb/>
            cured-and if any one charges me either with corrupting the <lb/>
            juniors by perplexing their minds with doubts, or with <lb/>
            reviling the seniors with bitter words either in private or in <lb/>
            public, I shall not be able to tell them either the truth, £ all <lb/>
            this that I say is right, and it is your interest, alone, o my <lb/>
            judges, that I am serving in acting thus,' or indeed any- <lb/>
            thing else. And therefore very likely there is no saying what <lb/>
            my fate may be.</p>
          <p>Cal. Do you think then, Socrates, that a man in such a <lb/>
             <pb n="125"/>
            condition and unable to help himself cuts a good figure in <lb/>
            a city ?</p>
          <p>Soc. Yes, Callicles, he would if he had that advantage <lb/>
            which you have so often admitted; if he had ' helped himself <lb/>
            by never having said or done any wrong either to men or <lb/>
            gods. For this we have repeatedly allowed to be the best of <lb/>
            all possible kinds of self-help. Now were I to be convicted <lb/>
            of incapacity for rendering help of this kind to myself or <lb/>
            another, of such conviction I should be ashamed whether it <lb/>
            took place before many or few or by myself alone; and if <lb/>
            my death were due to this kind of incapacity I should indeed <lb/>
            be vexed. But if it were for want of your ' flattering' rhe- <lb/>
            toric that I died, I am very sure you would see me meet my <lb/>
            death with calmness and composure. For death itself no <lb/>
            man fears, unless he be an absolute fool or coward; it is <lb/>
            doing wrong that a man fears: for to arrive at the world <lb/>
            below with the soul laden with many offences is the utter- <lb/>
            most of all evils. And now, if you please, I'll tell you a <lb/>
            tale to show you that this is really so.</p>
          <p>Cal. Well as you have done all the rest, you may as <lb/>
            well finish this too.</p>
          <p>Soc. 'Listen then,' as they (the story-tellers) say, 'to a <note type="margin"> c. 79 </note> <lb/>
            very pretty story which you, I dare say, will take for a fable, <note type="chapter">523 </note> <lb/>
            but I regard as a true story : for all that I am about to say <lb/>
            I wish to be regarded as true.</p>
          <p>Zeus Poseidon and Pluto, as Homer1 tells us, divided <lb/>
            amongst themselves the empire which they derived from <lb/>
            their father. Now in the days of Cronus there was a law <lb/>
            concerning mankind, which still at the present day as ever <lb/>
            prevails in heaven, that every man who has lived a just <lb/>
            and holy life departs after death to the Islands of the <lb/>
            Blest, and there dwells in perfect happiness beyond the <lb/>
            reach of ill; but whosoever has led a life of injustice and <lb/>
            impiety is consigned to the dungeon of vengeance and <lb/>
            punishment, which, you know, they call Tartarus. Of these <note type="footnote"> 1 Il. xv. 187 foil. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="126"/>
            there were in the days of Cronus, and still are in more <lb/>
            recent times under the empire of Zeus, living judges of <lb/>
            living men, who were appointed to sit in judgment upon <lb/>
            every man on the very day on which he was to die. And so <lb/>
            the cases were (often) decided amiss. So Pluto and the <lb/>
            guardians from the Isles of the Blest came and reported to <lb/>
            Zeus how that men undeserving were constantly coming <lb/>
            to them as well as to the other place. So spake Zeus: Nay, <lb/>
            said he, I will put an end to this. For true it is that now <lb/>
            the cases are ill judged. And this is because they that are <lb/>
            brought to trial are tried with their clothes on, seeing that <lb/>
            they are tried alive. Now many, said he, whose souls are <lb/>
            wicked are clothed with fair bodies and nobility and wealth, <lb/>
            and at the judgment many witnesses appear to testify on <lb/>
            their behalf that their lives have been passed in justice. So <lb/>
            the judges are confounded not only by their evidence? but at <lb/>
            the same time because they themselves sit in judgment <lb/>
            wrapt in clothes, with the veil of eyes and ears and indeed of <lb/>
            the entire body interposed before their own soul. All this <lb/>
            therefore stands in their way, their own wrappings as well as <lb/>
            those of them that stand before their bar. First of all then, <lb/>
            he continued, we must put an end to their foreknowledge of <lb/>
            their own death, for now they have this foreknowledge. This <lb/>
            however Prometheus has already received my orders to put a <lb/>
            stop to. Next they must be stript of all these clothes before <lb/>
            they are brought to trial; for they must be tried after death. <lb/>
            The Judge too must be naked, dead, with very soul scruti- <lb/>
            nising the very soul of each the moment after his death, each <lb/>
            man bereft of the aid of all his friends and relations and with <lb/>
            all that ornamental furniture left behind him upon earth that <lb/>
            the judgment may be just. Knowing all this before your- <lb/>
            selves, I have already appointed judges SODS of my own, <note type="chapter"> 524 </note> <lb/>
            two from Asia, Minos and Rhadamanthus, and one from <lb/>
            Europe, Æacus: These three after their death shall sit in <lb/>
            judgment in the Meadow at the Cross Roads, whence the <lb/>
            two lead, one to the Isles of the Blest, the other to Tartarus. <lb/>
             <pb n="127"/>
            And the souls from Asia Rhadamanthus shall try, and those <lb/>
            from Europe Æacus : and upon Minos I will confer the privi- <lb/>
            lege of deciding in the last resort (or, reviewing their sen- <lb/>
            tence) in case of doubt on the part of the other two, that the <lb/>
            judgment upon man's final journey may be perfectly just.</p>
          <p>This, Callicles, is what I have heard and believe to be true, <note type="margin"> c. 80</note> <lb/>
            and I reckon that from these tales may be drawn some such <lb/>
            moral as this. Death, as it seems to me, is nothing but the <lb/>
            dissolution, the parting from one another, of two things, the <lb/>
            soul and the body. And accordingly after their separation, <lb/>
            each of them retains its own state and condition pretty <lb/>
            nearly the same as it had when the man was alive, the body <lb/>
            retaining its own nature with the results of its training and <lb/>
            its accidental affections, all quite visible. For instance, if any <lb/>
            one's body was of great size either naturally or by feeding or <lb/>
            both, whilst he was alive, his corpse will be of great size too <lb/>
            after he is dead: and if he was fat, it will be just as fat after <lb/>
            his death; and so on for the rest. Or if again he adopted <lb/>
            the fashion of wearing his hair long, his dead body in like <lb/>
            manner will have long hair. Again if any one had been flog- <lb/>
            ged and bore traces of the stripes in the shape of scars on his <lb/>
            body, whether these were left by the scourge or by wounds <lb/>
            of any other kind, in life, his body visibly retains the marks <lb/>
            of them when the man is dead. And if the limbs of any one <lb/>
            were broken or distorted in life the very same will be visible <lb/>
            in death. And in a word, whatever characteristics a man's <lb/>
            body presented in life, the same likewise are visible in it <lb/>
            after his death, all or most of them, for a certain time. And <lb/>
            so, Callicles, it seems to me, the very same is the case with <lb/>
            the soul also; when a man's soul is stript of its bodily covering, <lb/>
            all its natural properties, as well as those accidental ones <lb/>
            which the man's soul contracted from his various habits and <lb/>
            pursuits, are visible in it. So as soon as they are arrived at <lb/>
            the place of judgment, they of Asia before Rhadamanthus, <lb/>
            them Rhadamanthus sets before him, and examines each man's <lb/>
            soul, not knowing whose it is ; nay often when he has laid <lb/>
             <pb n="128"/>
            hold upon the Great King himself, or any other prince or <lb/>
            potentate, he detects at once the utter unsoundness of his <lb/>
            soul, deeply marked by the scourge and covered with wounds <lb/>
            inflicted by perjury and iniquity, of which its own acts have <note type="chapter">525</note> <lb/>
            left the print on each individual soul; full of distortion <lb/>
            arising from falsehood and imposture, and all crooked by <lb/>
            reason of its having been reared without truth: or from <lb/>
            power and pride and insolence and incontinence finds the <lb/>
            soul laden with disproportion and ugliness. When he has <lb/>
            found such an one he sends it away in disgrace straight to <lb/>
            the place of ward, where on its arrival it is doomed to endure <lb/>
            all the sufferings that are its due.</p>
          <p><note type="margin"> c. 81 </note> Every one who undergoes punishment, if that punishment <lb/>
            be rightly inflicted by another, ought either to be made better <lb/>
            thereby and derive benefit from it, or serve as an example to <lb/>
            the rest of mankind, that others seeing the sufferings that <lb/>
            he endures may be brought by terror to amendment of life. <lb/>
            Now those who derive benefit from the punishment which <lb/>
            they receive at the hands of Gods and men are they that have <lb/>
            been guilty of remediable offences: yet still the benefit both <lb/>
            here and in the world below is conveyed to them through the <lb/>
            medium of pain and suffering; for in no other way can the re- <lb/>
            lease from iniquity be effected. But all those that have done <lb/>
            extreme wrong and by reason of such crimes have become in- <lb/>
            curable, these are they of whom the examples are made: and <lb/>
            these are no longer capable of receiving any benefit themselves, <lb/>
            seeing that they are incurable, but others are benefited who <lb/>
            behold them for their transgressions enduring the severest <lb/>
            most painful and most fearful sufferings in that prison house <lb/>
            in the world below, time without end; hung up as signal <lb/>
            examples there, a spectacle and a warning to the wicked as <lb/>
            they continually arrive. Of whom I say Archelaus too will <lb/>
            be one, if what Polus tells us is true, and every other tyrant <lb/>
            that resembles him. And I believe that the majority of these <lb/>
            examples is derived from tyrants and kings and potentates <lb/>
            and ministers of the affairs of states: for they by reason of <lb/>
             <pb n="129"/>
            the licence that they enjoy are usually guilty of the greatest <lb/>
            and most impious transgressions. Homer too is a witness to <lb/>
            the truth of this; for he has introduced kings and lords, Tan- <lb/>
            talus and Sisyphus and Tityus, as those who are suffering <lb/>
            everlasting punishment in the lower world. But Thersites or <lb/>
            any other private person that was wicked no poet has described <lb/>
            as incurable and therefore subjected to any heavy punish- <lb/>
            ment; because no doubt he wanted the power, and therefore <lb/>
            was so far happier than those that had it. However, Callicles, <lb/>
            be that as it may, it is to the class of the powerful that the <lb/>
            men who are distinguished for wickedness actually belong. <lb/>
            Still there is nothing to prevent good men being found even <note type="chapter"> 526 </note> <lb/>
            amongst these, and eminently worthy of admiration are those <lb/>
            that prove themselves such: for it is hard, Callicles, and <lb/>
            highly praiseworthy for a man to lead a just life when he <lb/>
            has full liberty of doing wrong. But small indeed is the <lb/>
            number of such: for true it is that here and elsewhere there <lb/>
            have been, and I don't doubt there will be hereafter, men <lb/>
            thoroughly accomplished in this virtue, the virtue of adminis- <lb/>
            tering justly all that has been confided to their care. And <lb/>
            one there has been very celebrated indeed, whose fame is <lb/>
            spread all over Greece, Aristides son of Lysimachus. But <lb/>
            most powerful men, my good friend, turn out bad.</p>
          <p>So as I was saying, whenever such an one appears before <note type="margin"> c. 82</note> <lb/>
            that Rhadamanthus we spoke of, he knows nothing else about <lb/>
            him whatsoever, neither who he is nor whence derived, except <lb/>
            that he is a bad man: and as soon as he discovers this he <lb/>
            sends him away at once to Tartarus, with a mark set upon <lb/>
            him to show whether he is curable or incurable; and upon his <lb/>
            arrival there he is submitted to the sufferings appropriate to <lb/>
            his case. And sometimes, when he sets his eyes upon another <lb/>
            soul that has lived a holy life in the society of truth, a private <lb/>
            man's or any other's, especially as I should say, Callicles, that <lb/>
            of a philosopher who has attended to his own business, and <lb/>
            not meddled in the affairs of (public) life, he is struck with ad- <lb/>
            miration and sends it off to the Isles of the Blest. Precisely <note type="footnote">9</note> <lb/>
             <pb n="130"/>
            the same is the practice of Æacus. And each of these two <lb/>
            sits in judgment with a rod in his hand. But Minos sits <lb/>
            alone overlooking the proceedings holding a golden sceptre, <lb/>
            as Ulysses in Homer says that he saw him, <lb/>
            I Wielding a sceptre of gold, and judging amongst the Departed.'</p>
          <p>Now for my part, Callicles, I am convinced by these stories, <lb/>
            and I consider how I may appear before my judge with my <lb/>
            soul in its healthiest condition. So renouncing the honours <lb/>
            which are the aim of the mass of mankind I shall endeavour <lb/>
            in the search after truth really to the utmost of my power <lb/>
            to lead a life of virtue and so to meet death when it comes. <lb/>
            And all other men I invite likewise to the best of my ability, <lb/>
            and you especially I invite in return to this course of life and <lb/>
            this conflict, which I say is worth all other conflicts here on <lb/>
            earth put together; and I retort your reproach, that you will <lb/>
            be unable to help yourself when that trial and that judg- <lb/>
            ment comes upon you of which I was even now speaking; <note type="chapter"> 527 </note> <lb/>
            but when you appear before your judge, the son of Ægina, <lb/>
            and he lays hold on you to drag you to his bar, you will stand <lb/>
            with open mouth and dizzy brain, you there no less than I <lb/>
            here, and some one perchance will smite you, yea shamefully <lb/>
            slap you in the face, and treat you with every variety of insult.</p>
          <p>All this however may perhaps seem to you a mere fable, <lb/>
            like an old wife's tale, and you look upon it with contempt. <lb/>
            And there would have been no wonder in our despising it, if <lb/>
            we could have found by any amount of search anything better <lb/>
            and truer. But as it is, you see that you three, three of the <lb/>
            wisest of the Greeks of our time, you and Polus and Gorgias, <lb/>
            are unable to prove that we should lead any other life than <lb/>
            this, which appears to be of advantage to us for the other <lb/>
            world as well as this; but amidst the multitude of questions <lb/>
            that we have been arguing, whilst all the rest were refuted <lb/>
            this doctrine alone stands unshaken, that doing wrong is to <lb/>
            be more carefully avoided than suffering it; that before all <lb/>
            things a man should study not to seem but to be good in his <lb/>
             <pb n="131"/>
            private and public life; that if a man become bad in any <lb/>
            respect, he is to be corrected; and that this is good in the <lb/>
            second degree, next to being just to become so, and to be <lb/>
            corrected by punishment: and that all kinds of ' flattery,’ <lb/>
            whether of oneself or others, of few or of many, are to be <lb/>
            avoided: and that rhetoric, as well as every other kind of <lb/>
            action, is to be employed ever for the maintenance of the <lb/>
            right, and for that alone (<foreign xml:lang="grc">οὕτως</foreign>).</p>
          <p>So take my advice and follow me to that bourn, where <note type="margin"> c. 83 </note> <lb/>
            when you have attained it, you will be happy in life and <lb/>
            after death, as our argument promises, and let any one look <lb/>
            down upon you as a fool and insult you if he pleases—aye, <lb/>
            by heaven, and cheerfully submit to endure from him even <lb/>
            that blow of infamy: for it will do you no harm if you be <lb/>
            really an honest and true man, practising virtue. And here- <lb/>
            after when we have so practised it together, then and not till <lb/>
            then will we set about politics, if it seem right to do so, or <lb/>
            consult then about any other plans we think proper, better <lb/>
            prepared for deliberation than we are now. For it is a shame <lb/>
            for men in the condition in which we now manifestly are to <lb/>
            assume airs of consequence, though we are never of the same <lb/>
            mind for two moments together upon the same subjects, and <lb/>
            those of the deepest moment; such is the undisciplined state <lb/>
            of our minds. Let us then take as a guide the views that <lb/>
            have even now declared themselves to us, which point out <lb/>
            that this course of life is best, in the practice of justice and <lb/>
            of every other virtue to live and to die. These then let us <lb/>
            follow and invite all others thereto; not those you put faith <lb/>
            in and invite me to: for they are nothing worth, Callicles. <note type="footnote"> 9—2 </note> <pb n="132"/>

          <p>‘Unhappy,' is another English word which “unites the mean- <lb/>
            ings of wicked and miserable"; as Trench notes in his Select <lb/>
            Glossary, p. 220, illustrating the former by quotations from <lb/>
            our earlier writers. ‘Unlucky’ has the same double meaning. <lb/>
            And similarly ‘poor rogue, poor devil,' are often employed, with- <lb/>
            out intending thereby to impute to the persons so designated any <lb/>
            other crimes but those of misfortune or misery.</p>
          <p>Another remarkable example of this association or confusion <lb/>
            of physical and moral good and evil appears in the modern <lb/>
            application of the English villain, and the French vilain, which <lb/>
            have transferred to the signification of moral depravity in the <lb/>
            former case, and of all that is mean and contemptible including <lb/>
            even personal ugliness in the latter, a term which originally <lb/>
            marked the low servile condition of the adscripti glebæ under <lb/>
            the Feudal system. The moral application of the word ‘base’ <lb/>
            seems to be similarly derived. The exact converse of this is <lb/>
            shown in the identification of high social rank and position with <lb/>
            moral worth in the names <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγαθοί, ἄριστοι, ἀριστη̃ες</foreign>, in the earlier <lb/>
            Greek authors, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">καλοί, κἀγαθοί, ἐπιεικει̑ς</foreign> in the later; of opti- <lb/>
            mates, boni, optimi, by the Latins; and Gute Manner, Herrn von <lb/>
            Rechte, and similar terms by the old Germans; which are bestowed <lb/>
            upon the nobility, the men of rank and wealth, of the highest <lb/>
            social and political importance in the state.</p>
          <p>See more on this latter subject in Donaldson's New Cratylus, <lb/>
            §§ 321—327, and Welcker, Theognis, Introd. p. xxi foil to which <lb/>
            Dr Donaldson refers.</p>
          <p>The explanation however of this association or transfer which <lb/>
            he gives seems hardly correct. The ‘virtue’ which is ascribed to <lb/>
            the higher classes in the early and half-civilized times in which <lb/>
            these terms originated is of a different kind to that more compre- <lb/>
             <pb n="133"/>
            hensive sort which is afterwards understood under the same name. <lb/>
            This is apparently overlooked by Dr Donaldson when he says, <lb/>
            Art. 327, "it was because the better classes, having no tempta- <lb/>
            tions like their poorer brethren, abstained from those vices which <lb/>
            common opinion reprobated, that their regular name became an <lb/>
            epithet descriptive of good moral conduct."</p>
          <p>This no doubt would help to fix such a designation upon them: <lb/>
            but the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρετή</foreign>, or virtus, which was ascribed to them was above <lb/>
            all others the martial prowess in which their wealth and con- <lb/>
            sequent superiority in arms and armour over the less favoured <lb/>
            classes, and the leisure for the cultivation of military habits and <lb/>
            exercises which it allowed, enabled them actually to excel: whilst <lb/>
            the same circumstances would admit and encourage the exercise <lb/>
            of generosity, liberality, courtesy, affability, and those other <lb/>
            shining qualities by which especially in rude and simple times the <lb/>
            popular imagination is most captivated.</p><pb n="134"/>

          <p>CALLICLES' bad memory has here deprived us of the true read- <lb/>
            ing of an interesting fragment of Euripides. The interpretation <lb/>
            and restoration of this much vexed passage are alike doubtful. <lb/>
            As to the former, Stallbaum construes <foreign xml:lang="grc">διαπρέπεις</foreign> in a neuter sense, <lb/>
            indolem animi adeo generosam puerili conspicuus es decore; but <lb/>
            I think such a construction is far too awkward to be found in <lb/>
            a writer celebrated for the neatness of his style like Euripides; <lb/>
            and that we ought certainly to give the verb a transitive sense, <lb/>
            ‘ make conspicuous.' Next, it appears from the general tenor of <lb/>
            the passage, and from the adverb <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἰσχω̑ς</foreign>, which is attached to <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">διαπρέπεις</foreign> by Philostratus in a reference to be cited below, that <lb/>
            the word has an unfavourable sense, and implies a disgraceful <lb/>
            notoriety; <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἰσχρω̑ς διαπρέπεις</foreign> being, turpiter insignem reddis: <lb/>
            whence it may be translated ‘ disfigure' or ‘ disgrace.'</p>
          <p>Valckenaer actually proposes <foreign xml:lang="grc">διαστρέφεις</foreign>, and Heindorf, who <lb/>
            thinks <foreign xml:lang="grc">διαπρέπεις</foreign> corrupt, hesitates whether to accept this inex- <lb/>
            cusable false quantity or Grotius' vox nihili, <foreign xml:lang="grc">διατρέπεις</foreign>.</p>
          <p>As regards the restoration of the verses, we are told by Olym- <lb/>
            piodorus in his commentary that the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">μειρακιώδει</foreign> is substituted <lb/>
            by Plato for <foreign xml:lang="grc">γυναικώδει</foreign> in the original. The more probable read- <lb/>
            ing <foreign xml:lang="grc">γυναικομίμῳ</foreign> is supplied by a quotation in Philostratus' life of <lb/>
            Apollonius of Tyana, iv. 21, p. 160, referred to by Grotius, <foreign xml:lang="grc">γυναι- <lb/>
            κομίμῳ μορφώματι κατὰ</foreign> TOV <foreign xml:lang="grc">Εὐριπίδην αἰσχρω̂ς διαπρέπειν</foreign>. It would <lb/>
            seem from this latter passage that <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἰσχρω̂ς</foreign> likewise stood in Euri- <lb/>
            pides' text-a word which may be thought almost necessary to <lb/>
            qualify the favourable sense which is elsewhere attached to <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">διαπρέπειν</foreign>. Valckenaer's restoration, which Stallbaum unsuspi- <lb/>
            cious of the violation of metre reproduces without remark in his <lb/>
            note, as Heindorf had done before him, is as follows; <pb n="135"/>
            <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_57_fig11.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              in which, besides the metrical objection, the phrase <foreign xml:lang="grc">ψυχη̂ς...Φύσις</foreign> <lb/>
              as an apposition to <foreign xml:lang="grc">σύ</foreign> the suppressed nominative to <foreign xml:lang="grc">διαπρέπεις</foreign>, <lb/>
              seems to me quite un-Euripidean. I had thought of the following: <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_57_fig12.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              To this reading of course the words of Philostratus are opposed, <lb/>
              supposing them to be a direct and literal quotation. Yet such a <lb/>
              supposition is by no means necessary, for they do not run in verse; <lb/>
              or again the author may have been quoting from memory, in <lb/>
              which case the compound <foreign xml:lang="grc">γυναικομίμος</foreign>, which occurs in all three <lb/>
              tragedians, might very naturally suggest itself as the more poetical <lb/>
              representative of <foreign xml:lang="grc">γυναικω̂ν</foreign>.</p>
          <p>Nauck, Trag. Græc. Fragm. p. 329, substitutes <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὧν σε φροντίξειν <lb/>
            ἐχρη̂ν</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὧν ἐπιμελει̂σθαί σε δει̂</foreign>, apparently because he thinks it is <lb/>
            more poetical. If that be his reason, he might have remembered <lb/>
            that the language of Euripides is often so familiar as nearly to <lb/>
            approach that of every-day life; and also that the poet employs <lb/>
            the word himself in Phœn. 559. Besides this, the apparently in- <lb/>
            tentional opposition between <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀμελει̑ν</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιμελι̂σθαι</foreign> seems to <lb/>
            vindicate the claim of the latter to a place in the text of Euripides. <lb/>
            Of Nauck's reading of the second line, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ψυχη̂ς ἔχων</foreign> yap <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὧδε γενναίαν <lb/>
            φύσιν</foreign>, I need say nothing <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοι̂ς συνετοι̂σιν</foreign>. <lb/>
            Valckenaer's restoration of the next line runs thus; <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_57_fig13.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              The words <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὔτ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂ</foreign>v <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀσπίδος</foreign>—<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁμιλήσειας</foreign> are adapted from another <lb/>
              hint of Olympiodorus.</p>
          <p>This likewise is open to the objection that it omits the word <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">λάβοις</foreign>, which certainly would not have been chosen here by Plato, <lb/>
            and therefore probably belongs to Euripides. It would be easy <lb/>
            to express the whole of this clause in a verse such as <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_57_fig14.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
               <pb n="136"/>
              but much more difficult to accommodate the verse when made to <lb/>
              the structure of the entire passage.</p>
          <p>The remainder of the verses are I think satisfactorily recon- <lb/>
            structed by Valckenaer. Except that for <foreign xml:lang="grc">παυ̂σαι</foreign> 8' <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀοιδω̂ν</foreign> it seems <lb/>
            to me that the participle substituted by Callicles, <foreign xml:lang="grc">παυ̂σαι</foreign> 8' <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐλέγ- <lb/>
            χων</foreign>, leads us rather to the reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀείδων</foreign>. Nauck, from Aristoph. <lb/>
            Av. 1382, and another passage, writes <foreign xml:lang="grc">μελωδω̂ν</foreign>, but I cannot see <lb/>
            how the fact of Aristophanes having once used the phrase <foreign xml:lang="grc">παυ̂σαι <lb/>
            μελωδω̂ν</foreign> can have any bearing upon the present passage: all that <lb/>
            can fairly be inferred from it is that Euripides might have so <lb/>
            written in conformity with the laws of the Greek language, <lb/>
            which no one even without this evidence would probably be <lb/>
            disposed to deny.</p>
          <p>It has not been observed that the injunction <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοιαυ̂τ</foreign>’<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄειδε</foreign> comes <lb/>
            in rather oddly after the very decided recommendation <foreign xml:lang="grc">ῥίψον <lb/>
            λύραν</foreign>, in one of the previous lines, however it may be qualified <lb/>
            by the reference of <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοιαυ̂τα</foreign> to <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολεμίων</foreign>, ‘feats of war, martial <lb/>
            achievements,' exclusively. Perhaps the word is corrupt; and <lb/>
            the mistake may have arisen from a confusion with <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀείδων</foreign> in the <lb/>
            line before.</p>
          <p>See Valckenaer’s Diatribe on the Fragments of Euripides, and <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>This ‘school' is, I have little doubt, the Pythagorean. First, <lb/>
            that the doctrine or fancy that the soul is buried in the body as <lb/>
            in a grave, or place of ward or punishment, was held by the <lb/>
            Orphic mystics, is distinctly shown by the passage of the Cratylus, <lb/>
            400 B. Compare Phced. 62 B, where it is referred to as an <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπόῤ- <lb/>
            ῥητος λόγος</foreign> by Cebes, who had been intimate with Philolaus in <lb/>
            Thebes his native city. p. 61 D. See also Brandis, Handb. I. p. 87 <lb/>
            and the reff. Now with the Orphics the Pythagoreans were <lb/>
            closely connected in doctrine and discipline. Herod. II. 81. See <lb/>
            Lobeck, Aglaoph. p. 795 foll. Prof. Thompson's note on Butler's <lb/>
            Lectures on the Hist. of Phil. I. 343. On the Orphics, their <lb/>

             <pb n="137"/>
            c. xvi. And this very same opinion on the condition of the <lb/>
            soul in this life was held likewise and expressed in the same <lb/>
            words by the Pythagoreans. Brandis, Handbuch, I. 495, notes <lb/>
            h and i; and Böckh, Philolaus, pp. 178—180 and foil. See espe- <lb/>
            cially the extracts from Clemens Alexandrinus, Theodoret and <lb/>
            Athenæus cited by both writers. Brandis refers to the whole of <lb/>
            this passage of the Gorgias as Pythagorean. And Böckh u. s. <lb/>
            pp. 186, 7 adds some other considerations, especially the fondness <lb/>
            of the Pythagoreans for etymologizing, tracing verbal resemblances, <lb/>
            or 'playing with words;' of which there are no less than four <lb/>
            examples here in Plato—<foreign xml:lang="grc">σω̂μα</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ση̂μα, πιθανὸς</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">πίθος, ἀνόητος</foreign>; <lb/>
            and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀμύητος</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀειδὴς</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἅιδης</foreign> (the last of which occurs like- <lb/>
            wise, Phæd. 50 D and 81 c); all which coupled with the direct <lb/>
            authorities cited by him is to my mind almost conclusive in favour <lb/>
            of ascribing these opinions to that sect together with the Orphics.</p>
          <p>Karsten however, Comm. in Empedoclem, pp. 301—303, and <lb/>
            Stallbaum in his note on this passage, differ from Böckh and Bran- <lb/>
            dis, and agree in attributing them to Heraclitus and Empedocles. <lb/>
            Heraclitus' claims may be despatched in a very few words. He is <lb/>
            neither a Sicilian nor an Italian, but an Ephesian: and though he <lb/>
            said no doubt in his symbolical mysterious way that life is death <lb/>
            (or what is equivalent to it), and that our souls are buried in our <lb/>
            bodies, there is no verbal correspondence as there is in the other <lb/>
            case. The authorities on which they both rely are Olympiodorus <lb/>
            and the Scholiast, who agree in calling Empedocles a Pythagorean, <lb/>
            and are therefore at least half in favour of the other supposition. <lb/>
            Karsten's remaining arguments are almost too trifling to deserve <lb/>
            notice. The first is derived from the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">Σικελὸς ἢ ̕Ιταλικός</foreign>, <lb/>
            which he says suit no one so well as Empedocles on account of <lb/>
            his Sicilian birthplace. But at all events he was not born in <lb/>
            both; and Philolaus and the Pythagoreans were all natives of <lb/>
            Italy, and therefore seem to have at least as good a claim to be <lb/>
            represented by Plato's alternative as the other. Next he says <lb/>
            that the paronomasiæ are rhetoricæ argutiæ Empedocli non <lb/>
            alienæ—but Böckh gives a much better reason, Philolaus' actual <lb/>
            practice, for ascribing them to the latter. The last two are <lb/>
            that Empedocles was Gorgias' master; and that in a passage of <lb/>
            the Sophist, 242 D, Heraclitus and Empedocles are coupled toge- <lb/>
             <pb n="138"/>
            ther in a similar phrase, <foreign xml:lang="grc">̓̕̕̕̕̕̕̕Ιάδες δὲ καὶ Σικελικαὶ Μου̑σαι</foreign>; both true, <lb/>
            but apparently not very much to the purpose.</p>
          <p>In illustration of the hidden meaning of the allegory I cannot <lb/>
            do better than quote the words of Steinhart in his Introduction <lb/>
            to Hieron. Miiller's translation of this dialogue, p. 378. Denn <lb/>
            das dichterische Gewand lässt die grossen Gedanken durchschim- <lb/>
            mern, dass die Herrschaft der Lust nicht das wahre Lebcn, son- <lb/>
            dern der Tod des Geistes set, class sie die Seele zur Aufnahme <lb/>
            reinerer und höherer Ideen unfähig mache, und zu einem eitlen <lb/>
            nichtigen unseligen Leben führe. The same writer goes on to <lb/>
            ascribe a serious meaning, and an argumentative intention to both <lb/>
            of these fables; a view which is likewise adopted by Susemihl, <lb/>
            another recent writer on the Platonic Philosophy. On this <lb/>
            Bonitz, Platonische Studien (in Sitzungs berichte der Kais. ACad. <lb/>
            der Wissenschaften, Vol. xxvi. p. 255) justly observes, that the <lb/>
            expressions used by Plato on the subject, 493 D, 494 A (and he <lb/>
            might have added the introductory phrases, 493 E, <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ γὰρ θαυμά- <lb/>
            ξοιμ̕̕</foreign>’ av K.T.X.) are entirely opposed to the notion that he designed <lb/>
            to lay any stress whatever upon them as a proof: vielmehr <lb/>
            bezeichnen die angefiihrten Worte des Sokrates in aller Deutlich- <lb/>
            keit, dass Platon in solchen Bildern nicht eine beweisende Kraft <lb/>
            anerkennt, sondern nur den bildlich anschaulichen Ausdruck <lb/>
            für eine Uberzeugung, welche bereits auf anderem Wege sicher <lb/>
            gestellt sein muss. The same may be said of the Myths; with <lb/>
            the exception that in their case no other kind of confirmation is <lb/>
            possible; in them poetical imaginations and popular convictions <lb/>
            and traditions take the place of the unattainable truth. Schleier- <lb/>
            macher in his note on the passage, p. 489, had already guarded <lb/>
            his readers against the error of attributing a serious purpose to <lb/>
            these allegories and an intention on the author's part of employ- <lb/>
            ing them in establishing his conclusions : he says that Plato is <lb/>
            speaking half in derision of such pompous trifling, and means to <lb/>
            imply that the argument can make no real progress until it <lb/>
            returns to his own simple and natural method.</p><pb n="139"/>

          <p>The late Dr Donaldson, in his little book on Classical Scholar- <lb/>
            ship and Classical Learning, Appendix, p. 253, writes thus: <lb/>
            “Now it is well known to all really good Scholars that or <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάνυ</foreign> <lb/>
            does not mean, as it is so often rendered by those who are imper- <lb/>
            fectly trained, whether Germans or Englishmen, 'not altogether,' <lb/>
            which admits that the thing may be so partially, but ‘altogether <lb/>
            not,' which contradicts the supposition that it can be so at all," <lb/>
            quoting Soph. Œd. Col. 142 or <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάνυ μοίρας εὐδαιμονίσαι πρώτης</foreign> as <lb/>
            necessarily meaning " not at all of an enviable condition," though <lb/>
            Hermann had rendered it non primæ profecto sortis hominem. or <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάνυ</foreign> therefore is always omnino non, never non omnino.</p>
          <p>To the same effect Buttmann, Index to Plato's four Dialogues, <lb/>
            p. 223, says, or voces non solum negat, sed in contrarium vertit <lb/>
            (cf. <foreign xml:lang="grc">φάναι</foreign>): sic imprimis or <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάνυ</foreign> non vertendum est ' non omnino' <lb/>
            sed omnino non, prorsus non, [I presume he means invariably, as <lb/>
            he adds no qualification or exception] ut apparel ex locis quales <lb/>
            sunt Men. 77 D, Crit. 48 A : sic igitur intelligenda sunt etiam <lb/>
            Men. 71 c, Ale. I. 128 B. This inference I altogether deny.</p>
          <p>To these authorities I have nothing to oppose but reason and <lb/>
            facts. First it is unreasonable and improbable to suppose that <lb/>
            two words which express by the very order in which they are <lb/>
            placed a qualified negative should invariably be applied to convey <lb/>
            an. unqualified negation. The emphatic negation is of course <lb/>
            naturally and properly expressed by the words in the reversed <lb/>
            order <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάνυ οὐ</foreign>, as in Thucydides, I. 8, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλλὰ</foreign> TO. <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὲν πρὸ Ἕλληνος του̑ <lb/>
            Δευκαλίωνος καὶ πάνυ οὐδὲ εἶναι ἡ ἐπίκλησις αὕτη</foreign> ; though it is true <lb/>
            that by some caprice of language usage has attached the same sig- <lb/>
            nification to them in the other collocation, and this sense has <lb/>
            become perhaps the more common of the two ; all that I argue for <lb/>
            is that this is not the only, nor the original, sense of or <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάνυ</foreign> in <lb/>
            this their usual order. This stronger sense, when it occurs, may <lb/>
            arise out of the other by giving an ironical tone to the words; <lb/>
            'not quite' may convey by the tone and manner of utterance idcn- <lb/>
             <pb n="140"/>
            tically the same meaning as ' absolutely not,' and so may pass by <lb/>
            usage into that signification when no irony at all is intended; and <lb/>
            this is probably the actual origin of the unqualified meaning; at <lb/>
            least I can see no other way of accounting for it. This view is <lb/>
            further confirmed by the parallel case of <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐχ ἥκιϭτα</foreign>, which by the <lb/>
            same <foreign xml:lang="grc">μείωϭις</foreign>, softening of the language, expressing a decided <lb/>
            meaning in mild terms, (and this is a sort of irony), has acquired <lb/>
            by usage the sense of <foreign xml:lang="grc">μόλιϭτα</foreign>.</p>
          <p>As to the question of fact, the difficulty in deciding the point <lb/>
            lies in this, that in the great majority of instances either sense is <lb/>
            sufficiently applicable, and many of them may be quoted in support <lb/>
            of either interpretation. Thus in the passage above quoted from <lb/>
            the CEdipus Coloneus it seems to me that it is by the ironical em- <lb/>
            phasis that the words are made to convey the unqualified negative, <lb/>
            and that they do really mean there ' not altogether which I have <lb/>
            always regarded as at once more poetical1 and more forcible than <note type="footnote"> 1 That this is no mere fancy of mine, but is actually warranted by the <lb/>
            facts of the case, will appear from the following considerations. Bp Thirl wall, <lb/>
            in his famous paper on the Irony of Sophocles, Phil. Mus. II. 483, thus defines <lb/>
            verbal irony. " This most familiar species of irony may be described as a <lb/>
            figure which enables the speaker to convey his meaning with greater force by <lb/>
            means of a contrast between his thought and his expression, or, to speak more <lb/>
            accurately, between the thought which he evidently designs to express, and <lb/>
            that which his words properly signify." </note><note type="footnote"> But there is a melancholy as well as a sportive irony; and, " where irony <lb/>
            is not merely jocular, it is not simply serious, but earnest." It is this kind of <lb/>
            irony which here gives character to the expression; and I need hardly point <lb/>
            out how much more appropriate such a subdued tone of melancholy is to the <lb/>
            old, blind, desolate CEdipus, in whose mouth the words are put, and how much <lb/>
            more in conformity with the spirit which, as Dr Thirlwall shows in detail, per- <lb/>
            vades and characterises the dramas of Sophocles, that deep feeling of the con- <lb/>
            trast between the reality and the outward appearance which constitutes the <lb/>
            very essence of Tragic pathos, than the sharp, flippant, querulous, " not at all <lb/>
            of an enviable condition," which is the rendering of Dr Donaldson. In fact <lb/>
            when we look at the interpretation of the passage of Sophocles from this point <lb/>
            of view, it may I think be safely asserted that here at all events the ironical <lb/>
            or qualified sense of the negative is the only one that good taste will tolerate. </note><note type="footnote"> It is singular that this of the CEdipus Coloneus is the only instance of the <lb/>
            use of this phrase that is to be found in the extant plays of Sophocles-this <lb/>
            may be stated with confidence on the authority of Ellendt's elaborate Lexicon <lb/>
            to this author. In Æschylus it never occurs at all: nor does it appear in the</note> <lb/>
             <pb n="141"/>
            the naked statement of the fact. Still, examples may be produced <lb/>
            which establish incontrovertibly that the words are susceptible <lb/>
            of the milder interpretation ; some of these I will now proceed <lb/>
            to cite.</p>
          <p>In Xen. CEcon. VII. 1, we have: <foreign xml:lang="grc">τί, ὦ 'Ιϭχόμαχε, οὐ μάλα εἰωθὼς <lb/>
            ϭχολάζειν κάθησαι; ἐπεὶ τάγε πλει̑ϭτα ἢ πράττοντά τι ὁρω̑ ϭε ἢ</foreign> ov <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάνυ ϭχολάζοντα ἐν τη̨̑ ἀγορα̨̑</foreign>. Here plainly the opposition is be- <lb/>
            tween being 'actively engaged' and 'not entirely idle :' were <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ <lb/>
            πάνυ</foreign> to be understood in the sense of omnino non, ' not at all idle, <lb/>
            quite busy,' there would be no distinction or opposition at all. In <lb/>
            Cyrop. II. 4. 13, <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἱ μὲν οἰκήϭεις οὐ πάνυ ἐν ἐχυροι̑ς...ὄρημέντοι ἐϭτὶ</foreign> <lb/>
            K.T.X. though the instance is not decisive, the probability is, as the <lb/>
            country spoken of is Armenia, and from the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄρη μέντοι</foreign> that fol- <lb/>
            lows, that the meaning intended is 'not very strong positions,' <lb/>
            rather than, 'not at all strong.' The same may be said of VIII. 2. <lb/>
            24, <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ πάνυ ἐπιμελουμένους</foreign>. II. 4. 27. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐὰν μὴ πάνυ πολὺ ἐλάττων ἡ <lb/>
            ὁδὸς ἦ̨</foreign>, is a more certain example; as is also Anab. I. 8. 14, o <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κυ̑ρος <lb/>
            παρελαύνων οὐ</foreign> 7ravv <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρὸς αὐτω̨̑ τω̨̑ϭτρατεύματι</foreign>1, and Hellen. VI. 4. 14, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἦν μέντοι οὐ</foreign> 7ravv <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν ἐπιπέδῳ, ἀλλὰ πρὸς ὀρθίῳ μα̑λλόν τι</foreign> TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϭτρατό- <lb/>
            πεδον</foreign>. These examples, with the exception of the first, I have <lb/>
            taken from Sturz's Lexicon : his list however is by no means <lb/>
            complete. <note type="footnote"> Lexicons to Homer, Pindar, Herodotus, or Euripides. It seems that it did not <lb/>
            become common till Plato's time: and the fact that it is more common in <lb/>
            him than in any other writer, is as far as it goes an additional argument in <lb/>
            favour of the ironical interpretation. In all earlier writers, so far as my <lb/>
            memory (and Indices) serve me, it is comparatively rare. In Caravella's very <lb/>
            complete Index to Aristopbanes I find no instance of <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ πάνυ. οὐδὲν πάνυ</foreign> <lb/>
            " nothing at all," occurs Nub. 733, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐδὲ πάνυ</foreign> "no such thing at all as..." <lb/>
            Ib. 902. <foreign xml:lang="grc">μηδὲ πάνυ</foreign> in the same sense, Pac. 121, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐδὲ πάνυ</foreign>, Lysistr. 588. <lb/>
            In Thucydides it appears from Bétant's Lexicon that there are only two exam- <lb/>
            ples, VIII. 38. 3 and 56. 2, both of them indeterminate. It first becomes <lb/>
            tolerably frequent in Xenophon. </note><note type="footnote"> I had not seen until this Appendix was written the following explanation <lb/>
            in Rost and Palm's Lexicon, Art. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάνυ. οὐ πάνυ</foreign>, 'nicht sehr, nicht eben,' <lb/>
            mit ironischer wendung bisweilen so viel wie 'durchaus nicht.' </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Kriiger's note on this passage is, non adeo prope ab exercitu suo, s. satis <lb/>
            longinquo a suis intervallo. Weisk. He refers also to v. 9. 26 as a similar <lb/>
            instance. </note> <pb n="142"/>
            </p>
          <p>In Demosthenes the phrase is seldom found. Adv. Neær. 1347. <lb/>
            14, is the only example given in lleiske's Index. Here, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ μὲν</foreign> yap <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐϭία οὐδὲ τρω̑ν ταλάντων πάνυ ἦτι ἦν</foreign> seems plainly to mean, " did <lb/>
            not altogether amount to, though Schäfer thinks differently. In <lb/>
            Olynth. <foreign xml:lang="grc">γ́</foreign>. 34. 18, <foreign xml:lang="grc">μιμου̑νται</foreign> 8' or <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάνυ</foreign>, on the other hand, I agree <lb/>
            with Schäfer, Appar. Crit. I. 297, in interpreting it, omnino non, <lb/>
            haudquaquam. Again, or <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάνυ δει̑...ἰϭχυρίζεϭθαι, Χεῤῥ</foreign>. p. 90. 18, <lb/>
            may be rendered either there is no occasion at all,' or, ' there <lb/>
            is no great need, no particular occasion to... ;' the qualified sense <lb/>
            however seems to me to agree rather better with the preceding <lb/>
            context. In the Philippics, Olyntbiacs with the one exception <lb/>
            quoted, de Pace, de Symmoriis, de Rhod. Libertate, Pro Megalop., <lb/>
            de Corona, no example occurs. In de F. L. § 189, or <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάνυ καλὸν <lb/>
            οὐδ' ἀϭφαλές</foreign>, there is nothing to fix the meaning either way. <lb/>
            In Contra Lept. 480. 1, <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὔτε πάνυ ῥά̨διον</foreign>, the adverb seems to be- <lb/>
            long to <foreign xml:lang="grc">ῥά̨διον</foreign> rather than to the negative. In Contra Aristocr. <lb/>
            § 104, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἵνα δὲ μὴ πάνυ θαυμάητε</foreign> is interpreted by the last Editor <lb/>
            Weber in the milder or qualified sense, as seems reasonable; <lb/>
            though Schäfer, App. Crit., renders it as usual by <foreign xml:lang="grc">μηδαμω̑ς</foreign>. We- <lb/>
            ber says, " Quippe hæ dicendi formæ ad eas pertinent quibus ali- <lb/>
            quid lenius exprimitur quam intelligi debet, sed quomodo id intel- <lb/>
            ligi debeat in loquendo sono vocis indicatur;" thus plainly taking <lb/>
            the same view that I have done of the mode in which the <lb/>
            emphatic denial is conveyed. He seems however to go too far, if <lb/>
            he means to reject altogether the sense omnino non, when he adds, <lb/>
            "Quare non in negatione ea vis est, ut cum Buttmanno Gr. p. 135. <lb/>
            n. 2, Passovio Lexic. s.v. or, et Hartungio de Part. II. Gr. II. p. <lb/>
            87, contendamus, earn quia coalescat cum <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάνυ</foreign> hujus notionem non <lb/>
            solum negare, sed plane in contrarium convertere. Id quam fal- <lb/>
            sum sit, jam inde apparet, quod negatio non ubique cum <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάνυ</foreign> con- <lb/>
            juncta est, ut Xenoph. Cyrop. 1. 6. 21, <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὔτε ζημίαις πάνυ τίθέλουϭιν <lb/>
            εἴκειν</foreign>, &amp;c." The last observation however deserves attention : <lb/>
            where <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάνυ</foreign>belongs to the adjective and is to be construed with it, <lb/>
            the transposition of the negative and the interpretation ' not at <lb/>
            all' are alike inadmissible.</p>
          <p>On Isæus, de Nicostr. Hered. § 12, <foreign xml:lang="grc">περὶ μὲν</foreign> yap <foreign xml:lang="grc">τω̑ν ἄλλων ϭυμ- <lb/>
            βολαίων</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάνυ χαλεπὸν τοὺς τὰ ψευδη̑ ματυρου̑ντας ἐλέγχειν</foreign>, Schö- <lb/>
            mann writes thus : non tollit negatio vim adverbii, sed adverbium <lb/>
             <pb n="143"/>
            negationem intendit, quasi dicas, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάνυ οὐ χαλεπόν</foreign>, h.e. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάνυ ῥᾴδιον, <lb/>
            οὐδαμω̑ς χαλεπόν</foreign>. There is nothing in this sentence to determine the <lb/>
            meaning of the two words except the general scope and intention <lb/>
            of this passage; and it is certainly truer, and at least equally pro- <lb/>
            bable that Isæus intended to say, that in the case of all other con- <lb/>
            tracts (except wills) false evidence is not very difficult to detect, <lb/>
            rather than that the detection of it is not at all difficult. But as <lb/>
            all orators are prone to exaggerate, this must be classed with the <lb/>
            doubtful instances.</p>
          <p>Schömann refers to <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐμάλα</foreign>1, ov <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρὸ πολλου̑, οὐ μετὰ πολύ, οὐχ <lb/>
            ὡς δει̑</foreign> (to which may be added <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐπροϭποιει̑ϭθαι</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="grc">προϭποιει̑ϭθαι <lb/>

            similar phrases) as parallel examples of the transposition of the <lb/>
            negative, explaining the signification 'omnino non' by this transpo- <lb/>
            sition. This however cannot I think be the true explanation of <lb/>
            the usage; for, if it were, it would seem that the phrase ought <lb/>
            always to have the same meaning, which is certainly not the case.</p>
          <p>In Aristotle, Eth. Nic. 1. 8. 16 (c. 9 Bekk.), <foreign xml:lang="grc">ού πάνυ γάρ εύδαι</foreign>- <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_57_fig15.jpg"/></figure><lb/>
               <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">δὲ ἴσως ἦττον εἴ τῳ κ.τ.λ</foreign>., it is quite clear that if the first class of <lb/>
              persons mentioned 'are incapable of any happiness at all,' the <lb/>
              second class must have less than none, which is absurd, and there- <lb/>
              fore <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ πάνυ</foreign> must here signify non omnino.</p>
          <p>In the same treatise VIII. 3 in speaking of <foreign xml:lang="grc">φιλία διὰ τὸ χρήϭι- <lb/>
            μον</foreign> he says that this kind of friendship is generally contracted by <lb/>
            men advanced in life; and that it is only men of a selfish dispo- <lb/>
            sition who form intimacies from such motives in youth or middle <lb/>
            life. He then continues <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ πάνυ</foreign> 8' <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἱτοιου̑τοι οὐδὲ ϭυζω̑ϭι μετ' <lb/>
            ἀλλήλων· ἐνίοτε</foreign> yap orS' <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰϭὶνἡδει̑ς</foreign>. Here again it is equally plain <lb/>
            that if he had meant to say that such men never live together at <lb/>
            all he would not have added <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνίοτε</foreign> yap. The fact that they are <lb/>
            sometimes disagreeable is given as a reason for their not being very <lb/>
            fond of intimate association, for their not often entering into it. <lb/>
            In the same book, c. 7, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλλ' οἱ τοιου̑τοι εὖνοι μέν εἰϭιν ἀλλήλοις</foreign>... <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄρχεϭθαι δ' ὑπὸ ἄλλων οὐμάλα ἐθἐλειν ἐλέγετο</foreign>, Xen. Anab. II. 6. 15, and <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ μάλα ἀφαμαρτάνειν</foreign>, Hellen. vi. I. 4, are examples of this use of <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ μάλα</foreign>. </note> <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">φίλοι</foreign> 8' <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ πάνυ</foreign>... clearly means that such persons are kindly dis- <lb/>
            posed to ono another, but that their friendliness does not quite <lb/>
            amount to friendship. Towards the end of the same chapter the <lb/>
            phrase occurs three times, and in each case denotes the rarity of <lb/>
            the union of agreeable and useful qualities in the same person. <lb/>
            Aristotle cannot mean to affirm (1) that men in high station can <lb/>
            never find friends who are at once useful and agreeable, however <lb/>
            rare such a combination may be; nor (2) that easy good manners <lb/>
            and conversational powers are never united in the same individual <lb/>
            with skill and dexterity in the conduct of business; in the third <lb/>
            instance he may mean to say that ' such persons are never to be <lb/>
            found.' Similarly in c. 15 of the same book : <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ πάνυ</foreign> 8' <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐδ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν</foreign> <lb/>
            Toȋ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ς δι</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡδονήν</foreign>. He had begun by saying that complaints and accu- <lb/>
            sations arise between friends in that form of friendship which is <lb/>
            founded on interest, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἢ μ</foreign>ó<foreign xml:lang="grc">νῃ ἢ μάλιστα εὐλόγως</foreign>, the latter alterna- <lb/>
            tive therefore implies the possibility of their arising in the two <lb/>
            other kinds also. Then after explaining why they are not -likely to <lb/>
            take place in the friendship which is founded on virtue, he adds the <lb/>
            words which I have already quoted. So that not only would it be <lb/>
            altogether unreasonable to deny the possibility of their occurrence <lb/>
            in this third kind of friendship, but that supposition is already <lb/>
            excluded by the above-mentioned alternative <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἢ ηάλιστα εὐλόγως</foreign>. <lb/>
            In other words <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ πάνυ</foreign> here necessarily means ‘ not often, rarely' <lb/>
            and not ‘never.’</p>
          <p>The next example from Categ. c. 8. p. 9. a. 6, is equally deci- <lb/>
            sive. The author is explaining the difference between <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕξις</foreign> and <figure type="illustration">

               <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἢ χείρον ἢ βέλτιον</foreign>. He cannot mean that these have no power of <lb/>
              retaining knowledge at all; because they have sufficient to consti- <lb/>
              tute a transient <foreign xml:lang="grc">διάθεσις</foreign> though not a permanent <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕξις</foreign>.</p>
          <p>Waltz in his brief note on Categ. 6. a. 32 says, <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ πάνυ</foreign>, non <lb/>
            omnino, non proprie; and cites 5. a. 32 and 500. a. 21 in illustra- <lb/>
            tion.</p>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">μα̑λλον δὲ οὐδ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅλως</foreign>, a passage which, if it stood alone, is quite <lb/>
            sufficient to decide the point in question.</p>
          <p>Of the multitude of examples which occur in Plato's writings, <lb/>
            most are somewhat doubtful and can be interpreted either way <lb/>
            without prejudice to the sense. There can however be no doubt <lb/>
            about the meaning of the following. Symp. 178 A, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάντων μὲν <lb/>
            οὖν</foreign> a <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕκαστος εἶπεν, οὔτε εἶπεν, πάνυ</foreign> 0 ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αριστόδημος ἐμέμνητο οὔτ</foreign> av <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὖ ἐγὼ ἃ <lb/>
            ἐκε</foreign>ȋ<foreign xml:lang="grc">νος ἔλεγε πάντα ἃ δὲ μ</foreign> a<foreign xml:lang="grc">λ</foreign>terra. K.T.X. and by the light of this <lb/>
            I should be disposed to interpret <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὧν οὐ πάνυ διεμνημόνευεν</foreign>, which <lb/>
            follows at p. 180 C. Also, Lys. 204 D, <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεινὰ ὄντα οὐ πάνυ</foreign> Tt <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεινά <lb/>
            ἐστιν</foreign> is an unquestionable example of the milder or qualified nega- <lb/>
            tion. <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ πάνυ ἐνεθυμήθην</foreign> Cratyl. 411 c, I should certainly under- <lb/>
            stand to mean ‘ I have paid no particular attention to it ;’ though <lb/>
            of course it may signify ‘ I have never considered it at all.' So <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ <lb/>
            πάνυ τι σοφός</foreign>, applied to Epimetheus, Protag. 321 B, should in my <lb/>
            opinion be rendered ‘ not being particularly wise,' which with the <lb/>
            help of the Platonic irony amounts to much the same thing as the <lb/>
            ‘absolutely silly person' which Dr Donaldson, op. cit. p. 254, tells <lb/>
            us is the only admissible rendering, and much more conformable <lb/>
            to Plato's usual style. The same may be said of the rendering of <lb/>
            the same phrase in Theæt. 150 c, where Socrates' modesty in dis- <lb/>
            claiming all pretension to wisdom is quite sufficiently expressed, <lb/>
            and more in his own style, by the milder form of abnegation : and <lb/>
            I have equally little doubt that <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ πάνυ εἰμὶ μνήμων</foreign>, Meno, 71 c, <lb/>
            is to be interpreted, " I have not a very good memory," rather <lb/>
            than “ I am altogether without it, or, I have no memory at all,” <lb/>
            though Buttmann (see above p. 139) takes the other view. In <lb/>
            Rep. IV. 432 D, <foreign xml:lang="grc">παί μοι δοκε</foreign>ȋ <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ πάνυ τι ἐκφευξε</foreign>ȋ<foreign xml:lang="grc">σθαι ἡμα̑ς</foreign> seems to <lb/>
            me to mean ‘ not very likely to escape us,' rather than ‘ there is no <lb/>
            chance of its escaping us,' ‘ it is certain not to escape us' for the <lb/>
            same reason, viz. that Socrates is not in the habit of expressing <lb/>
            himself strongly, or assuming the certainty of any given result.</p>
          <p>Philebus, 38 C, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰδόντι τινι πόῤῥωθεν μὴ πάνυ ασφω̑ς</foreign> is more natu- <lb/>
            rally understood in the sense of seeing not quite distinctly,’ than <lb/>
            ‘ quite indistinctly;’ though the latter is certainly admissible. <lb/>
            But the constant and scrupulous politeness of Socrates will not <lb/>
            allow of any other rendering of <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ ἔτνυ ἔτυχες οὗ λέλω</foreign>, Rep. VII. <lb/>
            523 B, than "you did not quite catch my meaning." Again, <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ</foreign> <note type="footnote"> 10 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="146"/>
            7ravv <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔλωγε θαῤῥω̑ περὶ τω̑ν γονέων</foreign> TOV <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοιούτου</foreign> Rep. IX. 574 B, <lb/>
            certainly means ‘I have no great confidence as to the fate of the <lb/>
            parents of such a man,' and in Rep. ix. 582 A, <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ πάνυ ἔγωγε ἔχω <lb/>
            εὶπε</foreign>ȋ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ν</foreign> seems to express a qualified rather than an unqualified igno- <lb/>
            rance. These examples might be multiplied almost indefinitely, <lb/>
            but I have already cited sufficient for my purpose. In the Gorgias <lb/>
            the phrase occurs in five places, in all of which I have rendered it <lb/>
            by not quite, not exactly, not altogether, or something equivalent. <lb/>
            448 D, 457 E, 472 c, 502 D, 513 c. In none of them is the <lb/>
            meaning absolutely certain, but in the second and last of them the <lb/>
            general sense is decidedly in favour of the milder form of interpre- <lb/>
            tation.</p>
          <p>As I have already said, a very large number of the instances <lb/>
            of this formula in Plato are of doubtful interpretation, in which the <lb/>
            sense will admit of either rendering indifferently; but in most of <lb/>
            these doubtful cases, as I have shown that we have the choice, con- <lb/>
            siderations such as I have already referred to, the Socratic irony, <lb/>
            the modest and ill-assured tone which the hero and chief speaker <lb/>
            of these dialogues is so fond of affecting, will, at all events when <lb/>
            the phrase is put into his mouth, usually incline us to reject the <lb/>
            decided and peremptory, in favour of the milder and qualified form <lb/>
            of denial.</p>
