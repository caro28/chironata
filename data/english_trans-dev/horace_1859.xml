          <p>IN the present edition of Smart's Horace, the trans­ <lb/>
            lation has been revised wherever it seemed capable of <lb/>
            being rendered closer and more accurate. Orelli's <lb/>
            text has been generally followed, and a considerable <lb/>
            number of useful annotations, selected from the best <lb/>
            commentaries, ancient and modern, have been added. <lb/>
            Several quotations from Hurd on the " Ars Poctica," <lb/>
            though somewhat lengthy, have been introduced, as <lb/>
            their admirable taste cannot but render them acceptable <lb/>
            to readers of every class.</p>

          <p>QUINTUS HORATIUS FLACCUS was born on the 8th of De­ <lb/>
            cember, in the year 65, B. c., at Venusium, a town situated <lb/>
            between Apulia and Lueania. Although a freedman, his <lb/>
            father possessed competent means, and left him a comfortable <lb/>
            patrimony on the banks of the Aufidus.</p>
          <p>To the education of our poet the greatest attention was <lb/>
            paid, and no means were spared to endow him with the <lb/>
            highest gifts of mental culture. The severe Orbilius was <lb/>
            his guide through the realms of Roman literature, for the <lb/>
            poets of which he seems to have conceived an early distaste, <lb/>
            preferring the more finished and less rugged beauties of the <lb/>
            Greek originals, from whose sources he was himself des­ <lb/>
            tined hereafter to draw so largely, and with such distin­ <lb/>
            guished success.</p>
          <p>The life of Horace, although spent in the society of those <lb/>
            who were most actively mixed up with public affairs, is rather <lb/>
            a detail of every-day transactions with the ordinary world, a <lb/>
            table-talk of private acts and feelings, than a succession of <lb/>
            stirring political relations, exploits, and embarrassments.</p>
          <p>Whilst engaged in the study of philosophy at Athens, a <lb/>
            study which was hereafter to form the ground-work of his <lb/>
            literary fame, the assassination of Julius Cæsar brought on <lb/>
            the crisis between the contending interests of Rome. Horace <lb/>
            joined the republican party, and attained the rank of a mili­ <lb/>
            tary tribune under Brutus. In whatever light we regard his <lb/>
            flight at the subsequent battle of Philippi, it is certain that <lb/>
             <pb n="vi"/>
            the disgrace was shared but by too many upon that day, in <lb/>
            which the Romans lost their last hopes of freedom, and ex­ <lb/>
            changed public virtue for private luxury and refinement.</p>
          <p>With the probability that In- small possessions, like those <lb/>
            of Virgil, were confiscated to remunerate a soldiery who had <lb/>
            fought against their own countrymen, we may fairly suppose <lb/>
            that this misfortune first tended to develope the poetical genius <lb/>
            of Horace, and that his necessities became a powerful motive <lb/>
            for the exertion of talents which had been chastened and <lb/>
            ripened by every advantage a fforded by the times. Gradually <lb/>
            his powers of wit and repartee, aided perhaps by the propiti­ <lb/>
            atory oblation of little poems "upon occasion," increased his <lb/>
            friendships with the great, and introduced him to the intimacy <lb/>
            of Mæcenas. A friendship of the firmest kind sprang up from <lb/>
            what was at first but a distant and patronizing courtesy, and <lb/>
            Horace, like Virgil, henceforth became the constant friend and <lb/>
            associate of Mæcenas, whom lie accompanied upon the most coil­ <lb/>
            fidential missions. About the year 37 it. C., (for the date is very <lb/>
            uncertain,1) Horace followed his patron to Brundusium, where, <lb/>
            in company with Cocceius Nerva and Capito, lie was engaged <lb/>
            in negotiating a reconciliation between Antony and Augustus. <lb/>
            A most amusing description of " travellers' miseries," in the <lb/>
            fifth Satire of the first Book, commemorates this event, and <lb/>
            gives an entertaining picture of the domestic habits of the <lb/>
            wealthier classes at Home during the Augustan age. In <lb/>
            accompanying Mæcenas in the war against Sextus Pompey, <lb/>
            a storm arose, and our poet narrowly escaped being drowned <lb/>
            in the Gulf of Velia. Nevertheless, lie volunteered himself as <lb/>
            his companion in the expedition that ended with the decisive <lb/>
            battle of Actium, an offer which Mæcenas, probably out of <lb/>
            tenderness to the health of his friend, declined to accept.</p>
          <p>Mæcenas was not a mere complimentary friend, but one of <lb/>
            tried liberality. To his kindness our poet was indebted for <note type="footnote"> I See Dunlop, Lit. Rom. vol. iii. p. 201, note. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="vii"/>
            his villa at Tibur, and to his intercession with Augustus, for <lb/>
            a grant of land in the Sabine district. The emperor even <lb/>
            offered him the appointment of private secretary to himself, <lb/>
            but he declined this honour, as it would have separated him <lb/>
            from the frequent society of Mæcenas. Augustus bore this <lb/>
            refusal in good part, and even personally encouraged our poet <lb/>
            to further literary exertions.</p>
          <p>Alternating between his dwelling on the then healthy <lb/>
            Esquiline hill at Rome, and the quieter and more congenial <lb/>
            retirement of his villa at Præneste, Horace lived a life of <lb/>
            Epicurean enjoyment, not wholly untainted with the vices of <lb/>
            the times, but yielding to them rather with the carelessness <lb/>
            of a wit, than with the wantonness of a voluptuary. His <lb/>
            mode of living at home was simple and unostentatious, but <lb/>
            he was by no means insensible to the pleasures of the table, <lb/>
            especially in society. He was a kind and indulgent master, <lb/>
            and a faithful friend. In fact, an unruffled amiability, re­ <lb/>
            lieved by a keen and well-expressed perception of other <lb/>
            men's follies, seems to have been the leading feature in our <lb/>
            author's conduct, and the guiding principle of his writings. <lb/>
            The beautiful compliment paid to the memory of his father,2 <lb/>
            is unsurpassed either as a description of what education ought <lb/>
            to be, or as a grateful tribute of filial affection.</p>
          <p>At the age of fifty-seven, in the year 8, B. C., Horace <lb/>
            died suddenly at Rome, having nominated Augustus as his <lb/>
            heir. Mæcenas died about the same time, almost fulfilling <lb/>
            the melancholy prediction of his poet friend, though it is <lb/>
            uncertain which first departed from life. In death they were <lb/>
            scarcely separated, the remains of Horace being deposited <lb/>
            near those of Mæcenas, on the Esquiline hill.</p>
          <p>The popularity of Horace, as a writer, is, perhaps, unex­ <lb/>
            ampled. Read, recited, and quoted in his own time by all <lb/>
            classes, throughout the cheerless period of superstition and <note type="footnote"> : Satire i. 6. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="viii"/>
            analytical dulness which oppressed the middle age?, lie was <lb/>
            one of the few bright spirits, in whose jokes and geniality <lb/>
            the Schoolman might forget even his Latin Aristotle, His <lb/>
            works became a constant source of delight and imitation to <lb/>
            almost all subsequent poets, especially those of Italy, while <lb/>
            commentary upon commentary began to point out beauties, <lb/>
            and dear away difficulties. Hii, manifold imitations of the <lb/>
            Greeks, especially in the lyrical portion of his works, his <lb/>
            punge nt and well-defined sketches of society and manners, his <lb/>
            nice perception of the refinements of urchæology and criticism. <lb/>
            all in turn began to call forth illustration. Yet much still <lb/>
            remains unexplained. As with Aristophanes, so with Horace, <lb/>
            we continually lack knowledge of the running current of <lb/>
            fashionable foibles and conventionalities, the happy deline­ <lb/>
            ation of which constitute the essence of comedy and satire. <lb/>
            Nevertheless, imitations in every language, in none more <lb/>
            abundantly than our own, attest the masterly power of Horace <lb/>
            to interest all mankind, and show the connexion that, despite <lb/>
            accidental variations, one age has with the development, one <lb/>
            race with the sympathies, of another.</p>

            Metellus Celer, and L. Afranius. This may well be considered as the <lb/>
            germ of the civil wars that ensued, and which blazed forth with fury ten <lb/>

            posed Adriatic, is meditating; neither be fearfully solicitous <lb/>

            Youth and beauty fly swift away, while sapless old age expels <lb/>
            the wanton loves and gentle sleep. The same glory does not <lb/>
            always remain to the vernal flowers, nor does the ruddy moon <lb/>
            shine with one continued aspect; why, therefore, do you fatigue <lb/>
            your mind, unequal to eternal projects ? Why do we not <lb/>
            rather (while it is in our power) thus carelessly reclining <lb/>

            made fragrant by roses, and anointed with Syrian perfume, <lb/>
            indulge ourselves with generous wine ? Bacchus dissipates <lb/>

            fled. after having uttered execrations [against such as should <lb/>
            return], and left their fields and proper dwellings and temples <lb/>
            to be inhabited by boars and ravenous wolves. Is this agree­ <lb/>
            able ? has any one a better scheme to advise ? Why do we <lb/>
            delay to go on shipboard under an auspicious omen ? But <lb/>
            first let us swear to these conditions-the. stones shall swim <lb/>
            upward, lifted from the bottom of the sea, as soon as it shall <lb/>
            not be impious to return ; nor let it grieve us to direct our <lb/>
            sails homeward, when the Po shall wash the tops of the Ma­ <lb/>
            tinian summits; or the lofty Apennine shall remove into the <lb/>
            sea, or a miraculous appetite shall unite monsters by a strange <lb/>
            kind of lust; insomuch that tigers may delight to couple with <lb/>
            hinds, and the dove be polluted with the kite; nor the simple <lb/>
            herds may dread the brindled lions, and the he-goat, grown <lb/>
            smooth, may love the briny main. After having sworn to <lb/>
            these things, and whatever else may cut off the pleasing hope <lb/>
            of returning, let us go, the whole city of us, or at least that part <lb/>
            which is superior to the illiterate mob: let the idle and <lb/>
            despairing part remain upon these inauspicious habitations. <lb/>
            Ye, that have bravery, away with effeminate grief, and fly <lb/>

            islands, where the unfilled land yearly produces corn, and the <lb/>
            unpruned vineyard punctually flourishes; and where the <lb/>
            branch of the never-failing olive blossoms forth, and the pur­ <lb/>
            ple fig adorns its native tree: honey distils from the hollow <lb/>
            oaks ; the light water bounds down from the high mountains <lb/>
            with a murmuring pace. There the she-goats come to the <lb/>
            milk-pails of their own accord, and the friendly flock return <lb/>
            with their udders distended; nor does the bear at evening <lb/>

            the stone on the summit of the mountain: but the laws of <lb/>
            Jupiter forbid. Thus you shall desire at one time to leap <lb/>

            with the Noric sword; and, grieving with your tedious indis­ <lb/>

            was to be carried out to burial. SAN. </note><note type="footnote"> 49 Riscris Cotyttia vulgata.—Cotyttia vulgando ridenda proposueris. <lb/>
            Cotys, or Cotytto, was the goddess of impurity; and although she did <lb/>

            concerning the duration of an age. Before the time of Augustus it <lb/>
            reckoned exactly a hundred years, and the Sibylline Oracle, which then <lb/>
            subsisted, marked precisely the same number. The fifth secular games <lb/>
            gave occasion to a new opinion. Augustus, persuaded that it was of great <lb/>
            consequence to the state not to omit the celebration of this festival, gave <lb/>
            order to the Sibylline priests to consult at what time of the current age it <lb/>
            ought to be celebrated. They perceiving that it had been neglected in <lb/>
            705, under Julius Cæsar, were anxious to find some way of covering <lb/>
            their fault, that they might not be thought answerable for all the calami­ <lb/>

            were the sole depositaries of the Sibylline books; the world was not in <lb/>
            general agreed upon the year by which the games should be regulated ; <lb/>
            and it was divided even upon the date of those in which they had formerly <lb/>
            been celebrated. The priests did not fail to take advantage of this <lb/>
            diversity of sentiments to flatter Augustus, by persuading him that the <lb/>
            secular year regularly fell upon 737. To this purpose they published <lb/>
            commentaries upon the Sibylline books, in which they proved by the very <lb/>
            words of the Sibyl, (though with some alteration from their ancient read­ <lb/>
            ing,) that an age ought to contain a hundred and ten years, and not a <lb/>
            hundred only. </note><note type="footnote"> The authority of these priests being infinitely respected by a super­ <lb/>
            stitious people, instantly put this falsehood into the place of truth, with­ <lb/>
            out any person daring to contradict it, since it was forbidden, upon pain <lb/>
            of death, to communicate the books of the Sibyls. The Prince, charmed <lb/>
            to see that the gods had reserved to his time the celebration of so great a <lb/>
            festival, immediately supported the imposture by his edicts to authorize <lb/>
            the discovery of the priests. Whether in flattery or credulity, the poet <lb/>
            gave himself to the public opinion ; and indeed he must, with a very bad <lb/>
            grace, have followed the ancient system in a poem composed by order of <lb/>
            Augustus, and sung in the presence of that prince, and of the priests in <lb/>

            which she piles up, by no means ignorant and not careless for <lb/>
            the future. Which Eant, nevertheless,] as soon as Aquarius <lb/>
            saddens the changed year, never creeps abroad, but wisely makes <lb/>
            use of those stores which were provided beforehand: while <lb/>
            neither sultry summer, nor winter, fire, ocean, sword, can drive <lb/>
            you from gain. You surmount every obstacle, that no other man <lb/>

            this little fountain." Hence it comes to pass, that the rapid <lb/>
            Anfidus carries away, together with the bank, such men as an <lb/>
            abundance more copious than what is just delights. But he <lb/>

            clination prompts them to it. As a certain person is recorded <lb/>

            hiss me ; but I applaud myself at home, as soon as I contem­ <lb/>
            plate my money in my chest." The thirsty Tantalus catches <lb/>
            at the streams, which elude his lips. Why do you laugh ? <lb/>
            The name changed, the tale is told of you. You sleep upon <lb/>
            your bags, heaped up on every side, gaping over them, and <lb/>
            are obliged to abstain from them, as if they were consecrated <lb/>
            things, or to amuse yourself with them as you would with <lb/>
            pictures. Are you ignorant of what value money has, what <lb/>
            use it can afford ? Bread, herbs, a bottle of wine may be <lb/>
            purchased ; to which [necessaries], add [such others], as, <lb/>

            the more desperate in his circumstances any one is, the more <lb/>
            severely he pinches him : he hunts out the names 12 of young <lb/>
            fellows, that have just put on the toga virilis under rigid fa­ <lb/>
            thers. Who does not cry out, 0 sovereign Jupiter ! when he <lb/>
            has heard [of such knavery] ? But [you will say, perhaps,] <lb/>
            this man expends upon himself in proportion to his gain. <lb/>
            You can hardly believe how little a friend he is to himself: <lb/>
            insomuch that the father, whom Terence's comedy introduces <lb/>
            as living miserable after he had caused his son to run away <lb/>
            from him, did not torment himself worse than he. Now if <lb/>
            any one should ask, "To what does this matter tend ?" To <lb/>
            this ; while fools shun [one sort of] vices, they fall upon their <lb/>
            opposite extremes. Malthinus walks with his garments trail­ <lb/>
            ing upon the ground; there is another droll fellow, who [goes] <lb/>
            with them tucked up even to his middle; Rufillus smells like <lb/>
            perfume itself, Gorgonius like a he-goat. There is no mean. <lb/>
            There are some who would not keep company with a lady, <lb/>
            unless her modest garment perfectly conceal her feet. An­ <lb/>
            other, again, will only have such as take their station in a <lb/>
            filthy brothel. When a certain noted spark came out of a <lb/>
            stew, the divine Cato [greeted] him with this sentence: <lb/>
            “ Proceed (says he) in your virtuous course. For, when <lb/>
            once foul lust has inflamed the veins, it is right for young <lb/>
            fellows to come hither, in comparison of their meddling with <lb/>
            other men's wives." I should not be willing to be commended <lb/>
            on such terms, says Cupiennius, an admirer of the silken veil.</p>
          <p>Ye, that do not wish well to the proceedings of adulterers, <lb/>
            it is worth your while to hear how they are hampered on all <lb/>
            sides ; and that their pleasure, which happens to them but sel­ <lb/>
            dom, is interrupted with a great deal of pain, and often in the <lb/>
            midst of very great dangers. One has thrown himself head­ <lb/>
            long from the top of a house: another has been whipped al­ <note type="footnote"> lent. For instance, Fufidins lent a hundred pounds, and at the end of <lb/>
            the month the borrower was to pay him a hundred and five, principal <lb/>
            and interest. But he gives only ninety-five pounds, deducting his interest <lb/>
            when lie lends the money, which thus increases in twenty months equal <lb/>
            to his principal. The laws allowed a usury called usura centesima, which <lb/>
            doubled the capital sum in a hundred months, or eight years and four <lb/>

            he had a mind to be good and generous, as far as his estate <lb/>
            and reason would direct him, and as far as a man might be <lb/>
            liberal with moderation ; he would give a sufficiency, not <lb/>
            what would bring upon himself ruin and infamy. However, <lb/>
            he hugs himself in this one [consideration] ; this he delights <lb/>
            in, this he extols ; " 1 meddle with no matron." Just as Mar­ <lb/>
            sæus, the lover of Origo,13 he who gives his paternal estate <lb/>
            and seat to an actress, says, “ I never meddle with other men's <lb/>
            wives." But you have with actresses, you have with common <lb/>
            strumpets: whence your reputation derives a greater per­ <lb/>
            dition, than your estate. What, is it abundantly sufficient to <lb/>
            avoid the person, and not the [vice] which is universally <lb/>
            noxious ? To lose one's good name, to squander a father's <lb/>
            effects, is in all cases an evil. What is the difference, [then, <lb/>
            with regard to yourself,] whether you sin with the person of <lb/>
            a matron, a maiden, or a prostitute ?14</p>
          <p>Villius, the son-in-law of Sylla, (by this title alone he was <lb/>
            misled,) suffered [for his commerce] with Fausta an adequate <lb/>

            things, and how different from this, does nature, abounding <lb/>
            in stores of her own, recommend ; if you would only make a <lb/>
            proper use of them, and not confound what is to be avoided <lb/>
            with that which is desirable ! Do you think it is of no con­ <lb/>
            sequence, whether your distresses arise from your own fault <lb/>
            or from [a real deficiency] of things ? Wherefore, that you <lb/>
            may not repent [when it is too late], put a stop to your pur­ <lb/>
            suit after matrons; whence more trouble is derived, than you <lb/>
            can obtain of enjoyment from success. Nor has [this par­ <lb/>
            ticular matron], amidst her pearls and emeralds, a softer thigh, <lb/>
            or limbs more delicate than yours, Cerinthus; nay, the pros­ <lb/>
            titutes are frequently preferable. Add to this, that [the pros­ <lb/>
            titute] bears about her merchandise without any varnish, and <lb/>
            openly shows what she has to dispose of; nor, if she has aught <lb/>
            more comely than ordinary, does she boast and make an os­ <lb/>
            tentation of it, while she is industrious to conceal that which <lb/>
            is offensive. This is the custom with men of fortune: when <lb/>
            they buy horses, they inspect them covered: that, if a beauti­ <lb/>
            ful forehand (as often) be supported by a tender hoof, it may <lb/>
            not take in the buyer, eager for the bargain, because the back <lb/>
            is handsome, the head little, and the neck stately. This they <lb/>
            do judiciously. Do not you, [therefore, in the same manner] <lb/>
            contemplate the perfections of each [fair one's] person with <lb/>
            the eyes of Lynceus; but be blinder than Hypsasa, when you <lb/>
            survey such parts as are deformed. [You may cry out,] " 0 <lb/>
            what a leg ! 0 what delicate arms ! " But [you suppress] that <lb/>
            she is low-hipped, short-waisted, with a long nose, and a <lb/>
            splay foot. A man can see nothing but the face of a matron, <lb/>
            who carefully conceals her other charms, unless it be a Catia. <lb/>
            But if you will seek after forbidden charms, (for the [circum­ <lb/>
            stance of their being forbidden] makes you mad after them,) <lb/>
            surrounded as they are with a fortification, many obstacles <lb/>
            will then be in your way: such as guardians, the sedan, <lb/>
            dressers, parasites, the long robe hanging down to the ancles, <lb/>
            and covered with an upper garment; a multiplicity of cir­ <lb/>
            cumstances, which will hinder you from having a fair view. <lb/>
            The other throws no obstacles in your way; through the <lb/>
            silken vest you may discern her, almost as well as if she was <lb/>
            naked ; that she has neither a bad leg, nor a disagreeable foot, <lb/>
            you may survey her form perfectly with your eye. Or would <pb n="147"/>

            you choose to have a trick put upon you, and your money ex­ <lb/>
            torted, before the goods are shown you ? [But perhaps you <lb/>
            will sing to me these verses out of Callimachus.] As the <lb/>
            huntsman pursues the hare in the deep snow, but disdains to <lb/>
            touch it when it is placed before him : thus sings the rake, <lb/>
            and applies it to himself; my love is like to this, for it passes <lb/>
            over an easy prey, and pursues what flies from it. Do you <lb/>
            hope that grief, and uneasiness, and bitter anxieties, will be <lb/>
            expelled from your breast by such verses as these? Would it <lb/>
            not be more profitable to inquire what boundary nature has <lb/>
            affixed to the appetites, what she can patiently do without, <lb/>
            and what she would lament the deprivation of, and to separate <lb/>
            what is solid from what is vain ? What ! when thirst parches <lb/>
            your jaws, are you solicitous for golden cups to drink out of? <lb/>
            What ! when you are hungry, do you despise every thing but <lb/>
            peacock and turbot ? When your passions are inflamed, and a <lb/>
            common gratification is at hand, would you rather be con­ <lb/>
            sumed with desire than possess it ? I would not: for I love <lb/>
            such pleasures as are of easiest attainment. But she whose <lb/>
            language is " By and by," " But for a small matter more," " If <lb/>
            my husband should be out of the way," [is only] for petit­ <lb/>
            maîtres : and for himself, Philodemus says, he chooses her, <lb/>
            who neither stands for a great price, nor delays to come when <lb/>
            she is ordered. Let her be fair, and straight, and so far decent <lb/>
            as not to appear desirous of seeming fairer than nature has <lb/>
            made her. When I am in the company of such an one, she is <lb/>
            my Ilia and Ægeria ; I give her any name. Nor am I ap­ <lb/>
            prehensive, while I am in her company, lest her husband <lb/>
            should return from the country; the door should be broken <lb/>
            open ; the dog should bark ; the house, shaken, should re­ <lb/>
            sound on all sides with a great noise; the woman, pale [with <lb/>
            fear], should bound away from me ; lest the maid, conscious <lb/>
            [of guilt], should cry out, she is undone; lest she should be <lb/>
            in apprehension for her limbs, the detected wife for her por­ <lb/>
            tion, I for myself; lest I must run away with my clothes all <lb/>
            loose, and bare-footed, for fear my money, or my person, or, <lb/>
            finally, my character should be demolished. It is a dreadful <lb/>

            account, because there are certain persons who can by no <lb/>
            means relish this kind [of satiric writing], as there are very <lb/>
            many who deserve censure. Single any man out of the crowd ; <lb/>
            he either labours under a covetous disposition, or under <lb/>
            wretched ambition. One is mad in love with married women, <lb/>
            another with youths; a third the splendour of silver captiv­ <lb/>
            ates : Albius is in raptures with brass; another exchanges <lb/>
            his merchandise from the rising sun, even to that with which <lb/>
            the western regions are warmed: but he is hurried headlong <lb/>
            through dangers, as dust wrapped up in a whirlwind; in <lb/>
            dread lest he should lose any thing out of his capital, or [in <lb/>
            hope] that he may increase his store. All these are afraid of <lb/>
            verses, they hate poets. “ He has hay on his horn,38 [they <lb/>
            cry;] avoid him at a great distance: if he can but raise a <lb/>
            laugh for his own diversion, he will not spare any friend: <lb/>
            and whatever he has once blotted upon his paper, he will take <lb/>
            a pleasure in letting all the boys and old women know, as they <lb/>
            return from the bakehouse or the lake." But, come on, attend <lb/>
            to a few words on the other side of the question.</p>
          <p>In the first place, I will except myself out of the number <lb/>
            of those I would allow to be poets: for one must not call it <lb/>
            sufficient to tag a verse: nor if any person, like me, writes in <lb/>
            a style bordering on conversation, must you esteem him to be <lb/>
            a poet. To him who has genius, who has a soul of a diviner <lb/>
            cast, and a greatness of expression, give the honour of this <lb/>
            appellation. On this account some have raised the question, <lb/>
            whether comedy be a poem or not: because an animated spirit <lb/>
            and force is neither in the style, nor the subject-matter: <lb/>
            bating that it differs from prose by a certain measure, it is <lb/>
            mere prose. But [one may object to this, that even in comedy] <lb/>
            an inflamed father rages, because his dissolute son, iliad after <lb/>
            a prostitute mistress, refuses a wife with a large portion ; and <lb/>
            (what is an egregious scandal) rambles about drunk with <lb/>
            flambeaux by day-light. Yet could Pomponius, were his <lb/>
            father alive, hear less severe reproofs! Wherefore it is not <note type="footnote"> 38 Fœnum habet in cornu. A metaphorical expression, taken from a <lb/>
            custom of tying hay on the horns of a mischievous bull. The laws of the <lb/>

            damages it committed, or deliver it to the person injured. " Si quadrupes <lb/>

            sufficient to write verses merely in proper language; which, <lb/>
            if you take to pieces, any person may storm in the same man­ <lb/>
            ner as the father in the play. If from these verses which [ <lb/>
            write at this present, or those that Lucilius did formerly, you <lb/>
            take away certain pauses and measures, and make that word <lb/>
            which was first in order hindermost, by placing the latter <lb/>
            [words] before those that preceded [in the verse] ; you will <lb/>
            not discern the limbs of a poet, when pulled in pieces, in the <lb/>
            same manner as you would were you to transpose ever so <lb/>
            [these lines of Ennius] : <lb/>
            When discord dreadful bursts the brazen bars, <lb/>
            And shatters iron locks to thunder forth her wars.39</p>
          <p>So far of this matter; at another opportunity [I may in­ <lb/>
            vestigate] whether [a comedy] be a true poem or not: now I <lb/>
            shall only consider this point, whether this [satiric] kind of <lb/>
            writing be deservedly an object of your suspicion. Sulcius <lb/>
            the virulent, and Capri us hoarse with their malignancy, walk <lb/>
            [openly], and with their libels too Fill their hands] ; each of <lb/>
            them a singular terror to robbers : but if a man lives honestly <lb/>
            and with clean hands, he may despise them both. Though <lb/>
            you be like highwaymen, Cœlus and Byrrhus, I am not [a <lb/>
            common accuser], like Caprius and Sulcius ; why should you <lb/>
            be afraid of me? No shop nor stall holds my books, which the <lb/>
            sweaty hands of the vulgar and of Hermogenes Tigellius <lb/>
            may soil. I repeat to nobody, except my intimates, and that <lb/>
            when I am pressed; nor any where, and before any body. <lb/>
            There are many, who recite their writings in the middle of <lb/>
            the forum ; and who [do it] while bathing: the closeness of <lb/>
            the place, [it seems,] gives melody to the voice. This pleases <lb/>
            coxcombs, who never consider whether they do this to no <lb/>
            purpose, or at an unseasonable time. But you, says he, de­ <lb/>
            light to hurt people, and this you do out of a mischievous <lb/>
            disposition. From what source do you throw this calumny upon <lb/>
            me? Is any one then your voucher, with whom I have lived? <lb/>
            He who backbites his absent friend; [nay more,] who does <lb/>
            not defend, at another's accusing him ; who affects to raise <lb/>
            loud laughs in company, and the reputation of a funny fellow <lb/>
            who can feign things he never saw ; who cannot keep secrets ; <note type="footnote"> 39 Literally, " After that dreadful discord burst asunder the iron­ <lb/>

            he is a dangerous man: be you, Roman, aware of him. You <lb/>
            may often see it [even in crowded companies], where twelve <lb/>
            sup together on three couches; one of which shall delight at <lb/>
            any rate to asperse the rest, except him who furnishes the <lb/>
            bath ;40 and him too afterwards in his liquor, when truth-tell­ <lb/>
            in- Bacchus opens the secrets of his heart. Yet this man <lb/>
            seems entertaining, and well-bred, and frank to you, who are <lb/>
            an enemy to the malignant: but do I, if I have laughed be­ <lb/>
            cause the fop Rufillus smells all perfumes, and Gorgonius, <lb/>
            like a he-goat, appear invidious and a snarler to you ? <lb/>
            If by any means mention happen to be made of the thefts <lb/>
            of Petillius Capitolinus41 in your company, you defend <lb/>
            him after your manner: [as thus,] Capitolinus has had me <lb/>
            for a companion and friend from childhood, and on being ap­ <lb/>
            plied to, has done many things on my account: and I am glad <lb/>
            that he lives secure in the city; but I wonder, notwithstand­ <lb/>
            ing, how he evaded that sentence. This is the very essence <lb/>
            of black malignity,42 this is mere malice itself: which crime, <lb/>
            that it shall be far remote from my writings, and prior to <lb/>
            them from my mind, I promise, if I can take upon me to pro­ <lb/>
            mise any thing sincerely of myself. If I shall say any thing <lb/>
            too freely, if perhaps too ludicrously, you must favour me by <lb/>
            your indulgence with this allowance. For my excellent <lb/>
            father inured me to this custom, that by noting each particular <lb/>
            vice I might avoid it by the example [ of others]. When he <lb/>
            exhorted me that I should live thriftily, frugally, and content <lb/>
            with what he had provided for me; don't you see, [would he <lb/>
            say,] how wretchedly the son of Albius lives? and how miser­ <lb/>
            ably Barrus ? A strong lesson to hinder any one from <lb/>
            squandering away his patrimony. When he would deter me <lb/>
            from filthy fondness for a light woman : [take care, said he,] <lb/>
            that you do not resemble Sectanus. That I might not follow <lb/>
            adulteresses, when I could enjoy a lawful amour: the character, <note type="footnote"> 40 Prœter eum, qui prœbet aquam. Their host, who provided water for <lb/>
            the bath ; a part of their entertainment to express the whole. SAN. </note><note type="footnote"> 41 The ancient commentator tells us, that Petillius was governor of the <lb/>
            Capitol, from whence he was called Capitolinus; that he was accused of <lb/>
            stealing a golden crown of Jupiter, and acquitted by the favour of Au­ <lb/>
            gustus. If there be any truth in this story, for we know not where the <lb/>
            commentator found it, he was more probably surnamed from his theft, <lb/>
            than for his government of the Capitol. FRAN. </note><note type="footnote"> 42 Properly, " the juice of the cuttle-fish." </note> <pb n="159"/>

            cried he, of Trebonius, who was caught in the fact, is by no <lb/>
            means creditable. The philosopher may tell you the reasons <lb/>
            for what is better to be avoided, and what to be pursued. It <lb/>
            is sufficient for me, if I can preserve the morality traditional <lb/>
            from my forefathers, and keep your life and reputation in­ <lb/>
            violate, so long as you stand in need of a guardian : so soon <lb/>
            as age shall have strengthened your limbs and mind, you will <lb/>
            swim without cork. In this manner he formed me. as yet a <lb/>
            boy: and whether he ordered me to do any particular thing: <lb/>
            You have an authority for doing this: [then] he instanced <lb/>
            some one out of the select magistrates :43 or did he forbid me <lb/>
            [any thing] ; can you doubt, [says he,] whether this thing be <lb/>
            dishonourable, and against your interest to be done, when this <lb/>
            person and the other is become such a burning shame for his <lb/>
            bad character [on these accounts] ? As a neighbouring <lb/>
            funeral dispirits sick gluttons, and through fear of death forces <lb/>
            them to have mercy upon themselves; so other men's dis­ <lb/>
            graces often deter tender minds from vices. From this [method <lb/>
            of education] I am clear from all such vices, as bring destruc­ <lb/>
            tion along with them: by lighter foibles, and such as you may <lb/>
            excuse, I am possessed. And even from these, perhaps, a <lb/>
            maturer age, the sincerity of a friend, or my own judgment, <lb/>
            may make great reductions. For neither when I am in bed, <lb/>
            or in the piazzas, am I wanting to myself: this way of pro­ <lb/>
            ceeding is better; by doing such a thing I shall live more <lb/>
            comfortably ; by this means I shall render myself agreeable to <lb/>
            my friends ; such a transaction was not clever ; what, shall I, <lb/>
            at any time, imprudently commit anything like it? These <lb/>
            things I revolve in silence by myself. When I have any <lb/>
            leisure, I amuse myself with my papers. This is one of those <lb/>
            lighter foibles [I was speaking of]: to which if you do not <lb/>
            grant your indulgence, a numerous band of poets shall come, <lb/>
            which will take my part, (for we are many more in number,)44 <lb/>
            and, like the Jews, we will force you to come over to our <lb/>
            numerous party. <note type="footnote"> 43 Unum ex judicibus selectis. The most eminent, and of greatest au­ <lb/>

          <p>HAVING left mighty Rome, Aricia received me in but a mid­ <lb/>
            dling inn: Heliodorus the rhetorician, most learned in the <lb/>
            Greek language, was my fellow-traveller: thence we pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded to Forum-Appî, stuffed with sailors and surly land­ <lb/>
            lords. This stage, but one for better travellers46 than we, <lb/>
            being laggard we divided into two; the Appian way is less <lb/>
            tiresome to bad travellers. Here I, on account of the water, <lb/>
            which was most vile, proclaim war against my belly, waiting <lb/>
            not without impatience for my companions whilst at supper. <lb/>
            Now the night was preparing to spread her shadows upon the <lb/>
            earth, and to display the constellations in the heavens. Then <lb/>
            our slaves began to be liberal of their abuse to the watermen, <lb/>
            and the watermen to our slaves. " Here bring to." " You <lb/>
            are stowing in hundreds; hold, now sure there is enough." <lb/>
            Thus while the fare is paid, and the mule fastened, a whole <lb/>
            hour is passed away. The cursed gnats, and frogs of the <lb/>
            fens, drive off repose. While the waterman and a passenger, <lb/>
            well-soaked with plenty of thick wine, vie with one another <lb/>
            in singing the praises of their absent mistresses: at length <lb/>
            the passenger, being fatigued, begins to sleep; and the lazy <lb/>
            waterman ties the halter of the mule turned out a-grazing to <lb/>
            a stone, and snores, lying flat on his back. And now the day <lb/>
            approached, when we saw the boat made no way; until a <lb/>
            choleric fellow, one of the passengers, leaps out of the boat, <lb/>
            and drubs the head and sides of both mule and waterman with <lb/>
            a willow cudgel. At last we were scarcely set ashore at the <note type="footnote"> 45 Octavius and Antony, both aspiring to the sovereign power, must <lb/>
            necessarily have had frequent quarrels and dissensions. Their reconcili­ <lb/>

            many negotiations, undertaken by their common friends to reconcile <lb/>
            them, history mentions two more particularly. The first in the year 714, <lb/>
            the other in 717, which was concluded by the mediation of Octavia, and <lb/>

            what ancestry descended each began the contest. The illus­ <lb/>
            trious race of Messius-Oscan :57 Sarmentus's mistress is still <lb/>
            alive. Sprung from such families as these, they came to the <lb/>
            combat. First, Sarmentus; " I pronounce thee to have the <lb/>
            look of a mad horse." We laugh ; and Messius himself [says], <lb/>
            " I accept your challenge:" and wags his head. " 0 !" cries <lb/>
            he, "if the horn were not cut off your forehead, what would <lb/>
            you not do; since, maimed as you are, you bully at such a <lb/>
            rate?" For a foul scar had disgraced the left part of Mes­ <lb/>
            sius's bristly forehead. Cutting many jokes upon his Cam­ <lb/>
            panian disease, and upon his face, he desired him to exhibit <lb/>
            Polyphemus's dance:58 that he had no occasion for a mask, <lb/>
            or the tragic buskins. Cicirrus [retorted] largely to these: <lb/>
            he asked, whether he had consecrated his chain59 to the house­ <lb/>
            hold gods according to his vow ; though he was a scribe, [he <lb/>
            told him] his mistress's property in him was not the less. <lb/>
            Lastly, lie asked, how he ever came to run away; such a lank <lb/>
            meagre fellow, for whom a pound of corn [a-day] would be <lb/>
            ample. We were so diverted, that we continued that supper <lb/>
            to an unusual length.</p>
          <p>Hence we proceed straight on for Beneventum ; where the <lb/>

            when they were set at liberty, they consecrated their chains to Saturn, <lb/>
            because slavery was unknown under his reign. But when Messius asks <lb/>

            the spreading flame made a great progress towards the highest <lb/>
            part of the roof. Then you might have seen the hungry guests <lb/>
            and frightened slaves snatching their supper out [of the flames], <lb/>
            and every body endeavouring to extinguish the fire.</p>
          <p>After this Apulia began to discover to me her well-known <lb/>
            mountains, which the Atabulus scorches [with his blasts] : <lb/>
            and through which we should never have crept, unless the <lb/>
            neighbouring village of Trivicus had received us, not without <lb/>
            a smoke that brought tears into our eyes; occasioned by a <lb/>
            hearth's burning some green boughs with the leaves upon <lb/>
            them. Here, like a great fool as I was, I wait till midnight <lb/>
            for a deceitful mistress: sleep, however, overcomes me, whilst <lb/>
            meditating love; and disagreeable dreams make me ashamed <lb/>
            of myself and every thing about me.</p>
          <p>Hence we were bowled away in chaises twenty-four miles, <lb/>
            intending to stop at a little town, which one cannot name in <lb/>
            a verse, but it is easily enough known by description.61 For <lb/>
            water is sold here, though it is the worst in the world; but <lb/>
            their bread is exceeding fine, insomuch that the wary traveller <lb/>
            is used to carry it willingly on his shoulders; for [the bread] <lb/>
            at Canusium is gritty ; a pitcher of water is worth no more <lb/>
            [than it is here]: which place was formerly built by the <lb/>
            valiant Diomedes. Here Varius departs dejected from his <lb/>
            weeping friends.</p>
          <p>Hence we came to Rubi, fatigued: because we made a long <lb/>
            journey, and it was rendered still more troublesome by the <lb/>
            rains. Next day the weather was better, the road worse, <lb/>
            even to the very walls of Barium that abounds in fish. In <lb/>
            the next place Egnatia, which [seems to have] been built on <lb/>
            troubled waters, gave us occasion for jests and laughter; for <lb/>
            they wanted to persuade us, that at this sacred portal the in­ <lb/>
            cense melted without fire. The Jew Apella may believe this, <lb/>
            not 1. For I have learned [from Epicurus], that the gods dwell <lb/>
            in a state of tranquillity; nor, if nature effect any wonder, that <lb/>
            the anxious gods send it from the high canopy of the heavens.</p>
          <p>Brundusium ends both my long journey, and my paper. <note type="footnote"> 61 This (as the Schol. informs us) was Equotuticum. The reason that <lb/>

            to resume the robe that you [were forced] to lay aside, and <lb/>
            become a tribune [again] ? Envy increased upon you, which <lb/>
            had been less, if you had remained in a private station. For <lb/>
            when any crazy fellow has laced the middle of his leg with <lb/>
            the sable buskins,65 and has let flow the purple robe from his <lb/>
            breast, he immediately hears ; " Who is this man ? Whose son <lb/>
            is he?" Just as if there be any one, who labours under the <lb/>
            same distemper as Barrus does, so that he is ambitious of being <lb/>
            reckoned handsome; let him go where he will, he excites curi­ <lb/>
            osity amongst the girls of inquiring into particulars ; as what <lb/>
            sort of face, leg, foot, teeth, hair, he has. Thus he who engages66 <lb/>
            to his citizens to take care of the city, the empire, and Italy, <lb/>
            and the sanctuaries of the gods, forces every mortal to be so­ <lb/>
            licitous, and to ask from what sire he is descended, or whether <lb/>
            he is base- by the obscurity of his mother. What ? do you, <lb/>
            the son of a Syrus,67 a Dama, or a Dionysius, dare to cast <lb/>
            down the citizens of Rome from the [Tarpeian] rock, or de­ <lb/>

            say,] my colleague Novius sits 68 below me by one degree: <lb/>
            for he is only what my father was. And therefore do you <lb/>
            esteem yourself a Paulus or a Messala? But he, (Novius,) if <lb/>

            and therefore shall not apologize [for my birth], in the man­ <lb/>
            ner that numbers do, by affirming it to be no fault of theirs. <lb/>
            My language and way of thinking is far different from such <lb/>
            persons. For if nature were to make us from a certain term of <lb/>
            years to go over our past time again, and [suffer us] to choose <lb/>
            other parents, such as every man for ostentation's sake would <lb/>
            wish for himself; I, content with my own, would not assume <lb/>
            those that are honoured with the ensigns and seats of state; <lb/>
            [for which I should seem] a madman in the opinion of the <lb/>
            mob, but in yours, I hope, a man of sense; because I should <lb/>
            be unwilling to sustain a troublesome burden, being by no <lb/>
            means used to it. For I must [then] immediately set about <lb/>
            acquiring a larger fortune, and more people must be compli­ <lb/>
            mented ; and this and that companion must be taken along, <lb/>
            so that I could neither take a jaunt into the country, or a jour­ <lb/>
            ney by myself; more attendants and more horses must be <lb/>
            fed; coaches must be drawn. Now, if I please, I can go as <lb/>

            Let it be allowed, I say, that Lucilius was a humorous and <lb/>
            polite writer ; that he was also more correct than [Ennius], <lb/>
            the author 16 of a kind of poetry [not yet] well cultivated, nor <lb/>
            attempted by the Greeks, and [more correct likewise] than <lb/>
            the tribe of our old poets: but yet he, if he had been brought <lb/>
            down by the fates to this age of ours, would have retrenched a <lb/>
            great deal from his writings : he would have pruned off every <lb/>
            thing that transgressed the limits of perfection ; and, in the <lb/>
            composition of verses, would often have scratched his head, <lb/>

          <p>You that intend to write what is worthy to be read more <lb/>
            than once, blot frequently: and take no pains to make the <lb/>

            your verses should be taught in petty schools ? That is not <lb/>
            my case. It is enough for me, that the knight [Mæcenas] <lb/>
            applauds: as the courageous actress Arbuscula expressed her­ <lb/>

          <p>THERE are some persons, to whom I seem too severe in Ethic <lb/>
            writing of] satire, and to carry it beyond proper bounds:' <lb/>
            another set are of opinion, that all I have written is nerveless, <lb/>
            and that a thousand verses like mine may be spun out in a <lb/>
            day. Trebatius,2 give me your advice, what I shall do. Be <lb/>
            quiet. I should not make, you say, verses at all. I do say <lb/>
            so. May I be hanged, if that would not be best : but I cannot <lb/>
            sleep. Let those, who want sound sleep, anointed swim thrice <lb/>
            across the Tiber; and have their clay well moistened with <lb/>
            wine over-night. Or, if such a great love of scribbling hur­ <lb/>
            ries you on, venture to celebrate the achievements of the in­ <lb/>

            pains.</p>
          <p>Desirous I am, my good father, [to do this,] but my strength <lb/>
            fails me: nor can any one describe the troops bristled with <lb/>
            spears, nor the Gauls 3 dying on their shivered darts, nor the <note type="footnote"> 1 Ultra legem. The laws of the twelve tables punished these poetical <lb/>
            slanderers with death ; but they were grown obsolete, and had lost great <lb/>
            part of their vigour, when they were renewed by Augustus. DAC. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Trebatius. This is C. Trebatius Testa, the most celebrated lawyer of <lb/>
            that age, as is evident from the letters which Cicero wrote to him. He <lb/>
            was greatly in favour both with Julius Cæsar and Augustus. As he ac­ <lb/>
            companied the first in his wars in Gaul, thirty years before this Satire was <lb/>
            written, he must, by this time, have been of an advanced age. Horace <lb/>
            applies to him as one of great authority, on account of his age and skill in <lb/>
            the law. He was further a good judge of raillery, and had often used it <lb/>
            with delicacy and success. WATSO. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 The Gauls of Aquitain having rebelled in 726, Octavius sent Messala, </note> <pb n="184"/>

            may describe him just and brave, as the wise Lucilius did <lb/>
            Scipio. I will not be wanting to myself, when an opportunity <lb/>
            presents itself: no verses of Horace's, unless well-timed, will <lb/>
            gain the attention of Cæsar; whom, [like a generous steed,] <lb/>
            if you stroke awkwardly, he will kick back upon you, being <lb/>
            at all quarters on his guard. How much better would this <lb/>
            be, than to wound with severe satire Pantolabus the buffoon, <lb/>
            and the rake Nomentanus! when every body is afraid for <lb/>
            himself, [lest he should be the next,] and hates you, though <lb/>
            lie is not meddled with. What shall I do? Milonius falls a <lb/>
            dancing the moment he becomes light-headed and warm, and <lb/>
            the candles appear multiplied. Castor delights in horseman­ <lb/>
            ship ; and he, who sprang from the same egg, in boxing. As <lb/>
            many thousands of people Eas there are in the world], so <lb/>
            many different inclinations are there. It delights me to com­ <lb/>
            bine words in metre, after the manner of Lucilius, a better <lb/>
            man than both of US.4 He long ago communicated his secrets <lb/>
            to his books, as to faithful friends: never having recourse <lb/>
            elsewhere, whether things went well or ill with him : whence <lb/>
            it happens, that the whole life of this old [poet] is as open to <lb/>
            the view, as if it had been painted on a votive tablet. His <lb/>
            example I follow, though in doubt whether I am a Lucanian <lb/>
            or an Apulian; for the Venusinian farmers plough upon the <lb/>
            boundaries of both countries, who (as the ancient tradition has <lb/>
            it) were sent, on the expulsion of the Samnites, for this pur­ <lb/>
            pose, that the enemy might not make incursions on the Ro­ <lb/>
            mans, through a vacant [unguarded frontier]: or lest the <lb/>
            Apulian nation, or the fierce Lucanian, should make an inva­ <lb/>
            sion. But this pen of mine shall not wilfully attack any man <lb/>
            breathing, and shall defend me like a sword that is sheathed <lb/>
            in the scabbard: which why should I attempt to draw, [while <lb/>
            I am] safe from hostile villains? 0 Jupiter, father and sove­ <lb/>

            which he is most powerful, and how strong natural instinct <lb/>
            commands this, thus infer with me.—The wolf attacks with <lb/>
            his teeth, the bull with his horns. From what principle is <lb/>
            this, if not a suggestion from within? Intrust that debauchee <lb/>
            Scaeva with the custody of his ancient mother; his pions <lb/>
            hand will commit no outrage. A wonder indeed ! just as the <lb/>
            wolf does not attack any one with his hoof, nor the bull with <lb/>
            his teeth ; but the deadly hemlock in the poisoned honey will <lb/>
            take off the old dame.</p>
          <p>That I may not be tedious, whether a placid old age awaits <lb/>
            me, or whether death now hovers about me with his sable <lb/>
            wings; rich or poor, at Rome or (if fortune should so order <lb/>
            it) an exile abroad ; whatever be the complexion of my life, I <lb/>
            will write. 0 my child, I fear you cannot be long-lived ; and <lb/>

            off that mask,8 by means of which each man strutted in public <lb/>
            view with a fair outside, though foul within ; was Lælius, <lb/>
            and he who derived a well-deserved title from the destruction <lb/>
            of Carthage, offended at his wit, or were they hurt at Metel­ <lb/>
            lus being lashed, or Lupus covered over with his lampoons ? <lb/>
            But he took to task the heads of the people, and the people <lb/>
            themselves, class by class ;9 in short, he spared none but <lb/>
            virtue and her friends. Yet, when the valorous Scipio, and <lb/>
            the mild philosophical Lælius, had withdrawn themselves <lb/>
            from the crowd and the public scene, they used to divert <lb/>
            themselves with him, and joke in a free manner, while a few <lb/>
            vegetables were boiled [for supper]. Of whatever rank I am, <lb/>

            O [say I] ye southern blasts, be present to taint the delicacies <lb/>
            of these [gluttons]: though the boar and turbot newly taken <lb/>

            sharp elecampane. However, all [appearance of] poverty is <lb/>
            not quite banished from the banquets of our nobles ; for there <lb/>
            is, even at this day, a place for paltry eggs and black olives.18 <lb/>
            And it was not long ago, since the table of Gallonius the auc­ <lb/>
            tioneer was rendered infamous, by having a sturgeon [served <lb/>
            up whole upon it]. What? was the sea at that time less nu­ <lb/>
            tritive of turbots?19 The turbot was secure and the stork <lb/>
            unmolested in her nest; till the prætorian [Sempronius], the <lb/>
            inventor,20 first taught you [to eat them]. Therefore, if any <lb/>
            one were to give it out that roasted cormorants are delicious, <lb/>
            the Roman youth, teachable in depravity, would acquiesce <lb/>
            in it.</p>
          <p>In the judgment of Ofellus, a sordid way of living will dif­ <lb/>
            fer widely from frugal simplicity. For it is to no purpose <lb/>
            for you to shun that vice [of luxury] ; if you perversely fly <lb/>
            to the contrary extreme. Avidienus, to whom the nickname of <lb/>
            Do- is applied with propriety, eats olives of five years old, <lb/>
            and wild cornels, and cannot bear to rack off his wine unless <lb/>
            it be turned sour, and the smell of his oil you cannot endure : <lb/>
            which (though clothed in white he celebrates the wedding <note type="footnote"> 18 Olives, intended for the table, were gathered when they began to <lb/>

            nature is unalterable. You are now as fond of turbot as Gallonius was of <lb/>

            but no coxcomb had made them fashionable, and the prætor decided in <lb/>
            favour of sturgeon. Another glutton brought turbots and storks into <lb/>
            vogue, and perhaps we only wait for a third man of taste to assure us, <lb/>
            that a roasted cormorant is infinitely more delicious than sturgeons, tur­ <lb/>
            bots, or storks. DAC. </note><note type="footnote"> 20 The storks built their nests in safety until the time of Augustus, when <lb/>

            to others, Rutilius Rufus, when candidate for the prætorship, entertained <lb/>
            the people with a dish of storks. But the people, according to an ancient <lb/>
            epigram, revenged the death of the poor birds by refusing the prætorship <lb/>
            to their murderer. From this refusal the poet pleasantly calls him præ­ <lb/>

          <p>What manner of living therefore shall the wise man put in <lb/>
            practice, and which of these examples shall he copy ? On one <lb/>
            side the wolf presses on, and the do, on the other, as the say­ <lb/>
            ing is. A person will be accounted decent, if he offends not <lb/>
            by sordidness, and is not despicable through either extreme <lb/>
            of conduct. Such a man will not, after the example of old <lb/>
            Albutius, be savage whilst he assigns to his servants their re­ <lb/>
            spective offices ; nor, like simple Nævius, will he offer greasy <lb/>
            water to his company: for this too is a great fault.</p>
          <p>Now learn what and how great benefits a temperate diet <lb/>
            will bring along with it. In the first place, you will enjoy <lb/>
            good health ; for you may believe how detrimental a diversity <lb/>
            of things is to any man, when you recollect that sort of food, <lb/>
            which by its simplicity sat so well upon your stomach some <lb/>
            time ago. But, when you have once mixed boiled and roast <lb/>
            together, thrushes and shell-fish; the sweet juices will turn <lb/>
            into bile, and the thick phlegm will bring a jarring upon the <lb/>
            stomach. Do not you see, how pale each guest rises from a <lb/>
            perplexing variety of dishes at an entertainment. Beside <lb/>
            this, the body, overloaded with the debauch of yesterday, de­ <lb/>
            presses the mind along with it, and dashes to the earth that <lb/>
            portion of the divine spirit.22 Another man, as soon as he <lb/>
            has taken a quick repast, and rendered up his limbs to re­ <lb/>
            pose, rises vigorous to the duties of his calling. However, <lb/>
            he may sometimes have recourse to better cheer ; whether the <lb/>

          <p>Our ancestors praised a boar when it was stale: not be­ <lb/>

            a visitor coming later than ordinary [might partake of it], <lb/>
            though a little musty, rather than the voracious master should <lb/>
            devour it all himself while sweet. I wish that the primitive <lb/>
            earth had produced me among such heroes as these.</p>
          <p>Have you any regard for reputation, which affects the hu­ <lb/>
            man ear more agreeably than music ? Great turbots and <lb/>
            dishes bring great disgrace along with them, together with <lb/>
            expense. Add to this, that your relations and neighbours <lb/>
            will be exasperated at you, while you will be at enmity with <lb/>
            yourself and desirous of death in vain, since you will not in <lb/>
            your poverty have three farthings left to purchase a rope <lb/>
            withal. Trausius, you say, may with justice be called to <lb/>
            account in such language as this; but I possess an ample <lb/>
            revenue, and wealth sufficient for three potentates. Why <lb/>
            then have you no better method of expending your super­ <lb/>
            fluities ? Why is any man, undeserving [of distressed cir­ <lb/>
            cumstances], in want, while you abound ? How comes it to <lb/>
            pass, that the ancient temples of the gods are falling to ruin ? <lb/>
            Why do not you, wretch that yon are, bestow something on <lb/>
            your dear country, out of so vast a hoard ? What, will mat­ <lb/>

          <p>That you may the more readily give credit to these things : <lb/>

            took as much as he pleased, restricted only by the feeling that excess <lb/>

            dred thousand sesterces for such a statue ; I was the only man <lb/>
            who knew how to purchase gardens and fine seats to the best <lb/>
            advantage: whence the crowded ways gave me the surname <lb/>
            of Mercurial.27 I know it well; and am amazed at your <lb/>
            being cured of that disorder. Why a new disorder expelled <lb/>
            the old one in a marvellous manner ; as it is accustomed to <lb/>
            do, when the pain of the afflicted side, or the head, is turned <lb/>
            upon the stomach ; as it is with a man in a lethargy, when he <lb/>
            turns boxer, and attacks his physician. As long as you do <lb/>
            nothing like this, be it even as you please. 0 my good friend, <lb/>

            truth in it; from whom, being of a teachable disposition, I <lb/>
            derived these admirable precepts, at the very time when, hav­ <lb/>
            ing given me consolation, he ordered me to cultivate a philo­ <lb/>
            sophical beard, and to return cheerfully from the Fabrician <lb/>
            bridge. For when, my affairs being desperate, I bad a mind <lb/>
            to throw myself into the river, having covered my head29 [for <lb/>

            which was given him in raillery. Mercury was the god of commerce, <lb/>
            and when a man had an uncommon skill in buying and selling, he was <lb/>
            usually called Mercurialis, or favourite of Mercury. A number of mer­ <lb/>

            distemper be in you exclusively, I will not add a single word, <lb/>
            to prevent you from dying bravely.</p>
          <p>The school and sect of Chrysippus32 deem every man mad, <lb/>
            whom vicious folly or the ignorance of truth drives blindly <lb/>
            forward. This definition takes in whole nations, this even <lb/>
            great kings, the wise man [alone] excepted. Now learn, why <lb/>
            all those, who have fixed the name of madman upon you, are <lb/>
            as senseless as yourself. As in the woods, where a mistake <lb/>
            makes people wander about from the proper path ; one goes <lb/>
            out of the way to the right, another to the left; there is the <lb/>
            same blunder on both sides, only the illusion is in different <lb/>
            directions: in this manner imagine yourself mad; so that lie, <lb/>
            who derides you, hangs his tail33 not one jot ,iser than your­ <lb/>
            self. There is one species of folly, that dreads things not in <lb/>
            the least formidable; insomuch that it will complain of fires, <lb/>
            and rocks, and rivers opposing it in the open plain ; there is <lb/>
            another different from this, but not a whit more approaching <lb/>
            to wisdom, that runs headlong through the midst of flames <lb/>
            and floods. Let the loving mother, the virtuous sister, the <lb/>
            father, the wife, together with all the relations [of a man pos­ <lb/>
            sessed with this latter folly], cry out; “ Here is a deep ditch ; <lb/>
            here is a prodigious rock ; take care of yourself:" he would <lb/>
            give no more attention, than did the drunken Fufius34 some <note type="footnote"> philosopher. But the pleasantry of the scene is, that Stertinius is going <lb/>
            to convince him he is a fool, and then advises him not to do any thing <lb/>
            which may dishonour his character. SAN. DAC. </note><note type="footnote"> 32 Chrysippi porticus. The Porticus was a famous gallery at Athens, <lb/>

            the sum [which he left them] upon his tomb: unless they had <lb/>
            acted in this manner, they were under an obligation 39 to ex­ <lb/>
            hibit a hundred pair of gladiators to the people, beside an en­ <lb/>
            tertainment according to the direction of Arrius ; and as much <lb/>
            corn as is cut in Africa. Whether I have willed this rightly <lb/>
            or wrongly, it was my will; be not severe against me, [cries <lb/>
            the testator]. I imagine the provident mind of Staberius fore­ <lb/>
            saw this. What then did he mean, when he appointed by will <lb/>
            that his heirs should engrave the sum of their patrimony upon, <lb/>
            his tomb-stone? As long as he lived, he deemed poverty a <lb/>
            great vice, and nothing did he more industriously avoid : in­ <lb/>
            somuch that, had he died less rich by one farthing, the more <lb/>
            iniquitous would he have appeared to himself. For every <lb/>
            thing, virtue, fame, glory, divine and human affairs, are sub­ <lb/>
            servient to the attraction of riches ; which whoever shall have <lb/>
            accumulated, shall be illustrious, brave, just—What, wise too ? <lb/>
            Ay, and a king, and whatever else he pleases. This he was <lb/>
            in hopes would greatly redound to his praise, as if it had been <lb/>
            an acquisition of his virtue. In what respect did the Grecian <lb/>
            Aristippus40 act like this; who ordered his slaves to throw <note type="footnote"> 39 Damnati populo. Alluding to the form of the will, in which the tes­ <lb/>

            to his master Aristippus, and by our author's manner of mentioning him <lb/>
            in many parts of his works, we may believe lie was no enemy to so conve­ <lb/>
            nient a philosophy. Staberius, who was a Stoic, has given an ill-natured <lb/>
            turn to this story, which is much commended by Cicero ; for Aristippus <lb/>
            had only one slave, whom he commanded to throw away as much of his <lb/>

            every where deservedly be styled delirious, and out of his <lb/>

            and gold, [and] knows not how to use them when accumulated, <lb/>
            and is afraid to touch them as if they were consecrated ? If <lb/>

            hungry, should not dare to take a single grain from it; and <lb/>
            should rather feed upon bitter leaves : if, while a thousand <lb/>

            bosom, [and] to give them and game them away ; you, Ti­ <lb/>

            lest you, [Aulus,] should follow the example of Nomentanus, <lb/>

            stancy, and adhere to their purpose: a considerable part fluc­ <lb/>
            tuates ; one while embracing the right, another while liable <lb/>
            to depravity. Priseus, frequently observed with three rings, <lb/>
            sometimes with his left hand bare,90 lived so irregularly that <lb/>
            he would change his robe every hour; from a magnificent <lb/>
            edifice, he would on a sudden hide himself in a place, whence <lb/>
            a decent freedman could scarcely come out in a decent man­ <lb/>
            ner ; one while he would choose to lead the life of a rake at <lb/>
            Home, another while that of a teacher at Athens ; born under <lb/>
            the evil influence of every Vertumnus,91 That buffoon, Vo­ <lb/>
            lanerius, when the deserved gout had crippled his fingers, <lb/>
            maintained [a fellow] that he had hired at a daily price, who <lb/>
            took up the dice and put them into the box for him: yet by <lb/>
            how much more constant he was in his vice, by so much less <lb/>
            wretched was he than the former person, who is now in diffi­ <lb/>

            all your fortune, your life, and reputation, together with your <lb/>

            Hercules, am I a thief, when I wisely pass by the silver vases. <lb/>
            Take away the danger, and vagrant nature will spring forth, <lb/>

            guests. Above [Nasidienus] himself was Nomentanus, below <lb/>
            him Porcius, ridiculous for swallowing whole cakes at once. <lb/>
            Nomentanus [was present] for this purpose, that if any thing <lb/>
            should chance to be unobserved, he might show it with his <lb/>
            pointing finger. For the other company, we, I mean, eat <lb/>
            [promiscuously] of fowls, oysters, fish, which had concealed in <lb/>
            in them a juice far different from the known: as presently <lb/>
            appeared, when he reached to me the entrails of a plaice and <lb/>
            of a turbot, such as had never been tasted before. After this <lb/>
            he informed me that honey-apples were most ruddy when ga­ <lb/>
            thered under the waning moon. What difference this makes <lb/>
            you will hear best from himself. Then [says] Vibidius to <lb/>
            Balatro; " If we do not drink to his cost, we shall die in his <lb/>
            debt: " and he calls for larger tumblers. A paleness changed <lb/>
            the countenance of our host, who fears nothing so much as <lb/>
            hard drinkers : either because they are more freely censorious ; <lb/>
            or because heating wines deafen the subtle [judgment of the] <lb/>

            crossed the seas, and that it was an Italian wine which Nasidienus recom­ <lb/>

            lest burned bread, lest ill-seasoned soup should be set before <lb/>

            neat? Add, besides, these accidents; if the hangings should <lb/>

            should break a dish. But adversity is wont to disclose, pros­ <lb/>

          <p>The poet renounces all verses of a ludicrous turn, and resolves to ap­ <lb/>
            ply himself wholly to the study of philosophy, which teaches to bridle <lb/>
            the desires and to postpone every thing to virtue.</p>
          <p>MÆCENAS, the subject of my earliest song, justly entitled to <lb/>
            my latest, dost thou seek to engage me again in the old lists,l <lb/>
            having been tried sufficiently, and now presented with the <lb/>
            foils 2 My age is not the same, nor is my genius. Veianius, <lb/>
            his arms consecrated on a pillar of Hercules' templet lives <lb/>
            snugly retired in the country, that he may not from the ex­ <lb/>
            tremity of the sandy amphitheatre so often supplicate the <lb/>
            people's favour.4 Some one seems frequently to ring in my <note type="footnote"> 1 Horace began to write at about four and twenty years of age, and he <lb/>
            is now past fifty, which he expresses by antiquo ludo, in allusion to the <lb/>
            schools, where the gladiators performed their exercises. Mens may be <lb/>
            understood either for a poetical genius, or an inclination to poetry. <lb/>
            SAN. DAC. </note><note type="footnote"> -Donatum jam rude. The poet compares himself with a gladiator ; <lb/>
            hence the use here of the terms of that art. A gladiator, who had been <lb/>
            relieved from the necessity of appearing before the public-who had re­ <lb/>
            ceived his discharge-is said to be donatus rude, and called rudiarias. <lb/>
            The rudis with which he was presented, as an emblem of freedom, was a <lb/>
            rod, or wooden sword. M'CAUL. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 After Hercules had wandered through the world destroying monsters, <lb/>
            he was received by Greece and Italy among the gods who presided over <lb/>
            athletic exercises. There was generally a temple of this god near their <lb/>
            amphitheatres, in which the ceremonies of receiving a new gladiator <lb/>
            into the company were performed. From thence the custom of conse­ <lb/>
            crating their arms to Hercules. FRAN. </note><note type="footnote"> * Horace would authorize his resolution of writing no more, by the </note> <note type="footnote"> Q 2 </note> <pb n="228"/>

            purified ear: ""Wisely in time dismiss the aged courser, lest, <lb/>
            an object of derision, he miscarry at last, and break his wind." <lb/>
            Now therefore I lay aside both verses, and all other sportive <lb/>
            matters ; my study and inquiry is after what is true and <lb/>
            fitting, and I am wholly engaged in this: I lay up, and collect <lb/>
            rules which I may be able hereafter to bring into use. And <lb/>
            lest you should perchance ask under what leader, in what <lb/>
            house [of philosophy], I enter myself a pupil: addicted to <lb/>
            swear implicitly to the ipse-dixits5 of no particular master, <lb/>
            wherever the weather drives me, I am carried a guest. One <lb/>
            while I become active, and am plunged in the waves of state <lb/>
            affairs, a maintainer and a rigid partisan of strict virtue; then <lb/>
            again I relapse insensibly into Aristippus' maxims,6 and en­ <lb/>
            deavour to adapt circumstances to myself, not myself to cir­ <lb/>
            cumstances. As the night seems long to those with whom a <lb/>
            mistress has broken her appointment, and the day slow to <lb/>
            those who owe their labour; as the year moves lazy with <lb/>
            minors, whom the harsh guardianship of their mothers con­ <lb/>
            fines ; so all that time to me flows tedious and distasteful, <lb/>
            which delays my hope and design of strenuously executing <lb/>
            that which is of equal benefit to the poor and to the rich, <lb/>
            which neglected will be of equal detriment to young and to <lb/>
            old. It remains, that I conduct and comfort myself by these <note type="footnote"> example of Veianius, who having often fought with success, was now <lb/>
            retired into the country, determined never to expose himself on the stage <lb/>
            again ; for if a gladiator, who had obtained his discharge, ever engaged <lb/>
            a second time, he was obliged to have a second dismission, and going to <lb/>
            the end of the stage, extrema arena, implored the people to give him his <lb/>
            freedom. CRUQ. </note><note type="footnote"> 5 Jurare in verba magistri. Similarly, Epod. 15, in verba jurant mea. <lb/>
            Soldiers jurabant in verba imperatoris, when entering on service; whence, <lb/>
            some think Horace alludes to this; others suppose the reference is to the <lb/>
            great respect paid to Pythagoras by his disciples, so that the words ipse <lb/>
            dixit were sufficient to decide any question. M'CAUL. </note><note type="footnote"> 6 This naturally follows the three preceding lines. Horace could not <lb/>
            long be reconciled to the two former systems; one required too much <lb/>
            action, the other too much severity; and neither of them was agreeable <lb/>
            to his inclination. The morals of Aristippus, who founded the Epicurean <lb/>
            sect, were more to his taste; but as this philosophy was very severely <lb/>
            treated by the Stoics and Cynics, the poet pleasantly says, he was obliged <lb/>
            with privacy, furtim, to follow its doctrines. SAN. </note><note type="footnote"> Horace, by the word furtim, might probably mean, that he did not <lb/>
            pass, at once, from the sentiments of Zeno to those of Aristippus, as it <lb/>
            were from one extreme to another, but by degrees, and insensibly. DAC. <lb/>
            This latter view is correct. ED. DUEL. </note> <pb n="229"/>

            principles: your sight is not so piercing as that of Lynceus ; <lb/>
            you will not however therefore despise being anointed, if you <lb/>
            are sore-eyed: nor because you despair of the muscles of the <lb/>
            invincible Glycon,7 will you be careless of preserving your <lb/>
            body from the knotty gout. There is some point to which we <lb/>
            may reach, if we can go no further. Does your heart burn <lb/>
            with avarice, and a wretched desire of more? Spells there <lb/>
            are, and incantations, with which you may mitigate this pain, <lb/>
            and rid yourself of a great part of the distemper. Do you <lb/>
            swell with the love of praise? There are certain purgations <lb/>
            which can restore you, a certain treatise being perused thrice <lb/>
            with purity of mind. The envious, the choleric, the indolent, <lb/>
            the slave to wine, to women-none is so savage that he can­ <lb/>
            not be tamed, if he will only lend a patient ear to discipline.</p>
          <p>It is virtue, to fly vice; and the highest wisdom, to have <lb/>
            lived free from folly. You see with what toil of mind and <lb/>
            body you avoid those things which you believe to be the <lb/>
            greatest evils, a small fortune and a shameful repulse. An <lb/>
            active merchant, you run to the remotest Indies,8 fleeing <lb/>
            poverty through sea, through rocks, through flames. And <lb/>
            will you not learn, and hear, and be advised by one who is <lb/>
            wiser, that you may no longer regard those things which you <lb/>
            foolishly admire and wish for ? What little champion of the <lb/>
            villages and of the streets would scorn being crowned at the <lb/>
            great Olympic9 games, who had the hopes and happy oppor- <note type="footnote"> 7 The commentators tell us, from Diogenes Laërtius, that Glycon was <lb/>
            a philosopher who had made himself famous by his dexterity and skill in <lb/>
            athletic exercises. But more probably the poet alluded to a statue, <lb/>
            which is still preserved in Rome, and of which Montfaueon speaks thus: <lb/>
            Hercules of Farnese, the finest of all, is a master-piece of art. It is the <lb/>
            performance of Glycou the Athenian, who hath immortalized his name <lb/>
            by putting it at the bottom of this admirable statue. It is a common <lb/>
            language to say of pictures and statues, that is a Titian; this an Apelles. <lb/>
            FRAN. </note><note type="footnote"> 8 Before the reduction of Egypt and Arabia, the passage to India was <lb/>
            unknown to the Romans. Strabo tells us that while Ælins Gallus <lb/>
            governed Egypt, in the year 727, a fleet of twenty-six merchant-men set <lb/>
            sail from the Red Sea for India. The Romans, attentive to their <lb/>
            interests, flattered by an immense profit arising from this trade, and <lb/>
            allured by the rich and beautiful merchandise, which it brought home, <lb/>
            applied themselves earnestly to this commerce, from whence the poet <lb/>
            reproaches them with excessive covetousness. SAN. </note><note type="footnote"> 9 Horace, in imitation of Pindar, calls the Olympic games " magna, <lb/>

            from the lowest inculcates; young men and old repeat these <lb/>
            maxims, having their bags and account-books hung on the <lb/>
            left arm. You have soul, have breeding, have eloquence and <lb/>
            honour: yet if six or seven thousand sesterces be wanting to <lb/>
            complete your four hundred thousand, you shall be a ple­ <lb/>
            beian.11 But boys at play 12 cry, "You shall be king, if you <lb/>
            will do right." Let this be a [man's] brazen wall, to be <lb/>
            conscious of no ill, to turn pale with no guilt. Tell me, pray, <lb/>
            is the Roscian law best, or the boy's song which offers the <lb/>
            kingdom to them that do right, sung by the manly Curii and <lb/>
            Camilli ? Does he advise you best, who says, " Make a <lb/>
            fortune; a fortune, if you can, honestly ; if not, a fortune by <lb/>
            any means "-that you may view from a nearer bench the <lb/>
            tear-moving poems of Puppius : or he, who still animates and <lb/>
            enables you to stand free and upright, a match for haughty <lb/>

          <p>If now perchance the Roman people should ask me, why I <lb/>
            do not enjoy the same sentiments with them, as [I do the <lb/>

            of Rome, but we are expressly told by Livy, that there were three in the <lb/>

            hundred thousand. Augustus afterwards raised the sum to twelve <lb/>

            who would inveigle covetous widows with sweet-meats and <lb/>
            fruits, and insnare old men, whom they would send [like fish] <lb/>
            into their ponds : the fortunes of many grow by concealed <lb/>
            usury. But be it, that different men are engaged in different <lb/>
            employments and pursuits: can the same persons continue an <lb/>
            hour together approving the same things ? If the man of <lb/>
            wealth has said, " no bay in the world outshines delightful <lb/>
            Baiæ," the lake and the sea presently feel the eagerness of <lb/>
            their impetuous master : to whom, if a vicious humour gives <lb/>
            the omen, [he will cry,]—"to-morrow, workmen, ye shall <lb/>

            better than a single life. If he has not, he swears the married <lb/>
            only are happy. With what noose can I hold this Proteus, <lb/>
            varying thus his forms ? What does the poor man ? Laugh <lb/>
            [at him too] : is he not for ever changing his garrets, beds, <lb/>
            baths, barbers ? He is as much surfeited in a hired boat, as <lb/>
            the rich man is, whom his own galley conveys.</p>
          <p>If I meet you with my hair cut 14 by an uneven barber, you <lb/>
            laugh [at me] : if I chance to have a ragged shirt under a <lb/>
            handsome coat, or if my disproportioned gown fits me ill, you <lb/>
            laugh. What [do you do], when my judgment contradicts <lb/>
            itself ? it despises what it before desired ; seeks for that <lb/>
            which lately it neglected; is all in a ferment, and is incon­ <lb/>

            teaches more clearly, and better than Chrysippus and Crantor, <lb/>
            what is honourable, what shameful, what profitable, what not <lb/>
            so. If nothing hinders you, hear why I have thus concluded. <lb/>
            The story in which, on account of Paris's intrigue, Greece is <lb/>
            stated to be wasted in a tedious war with the barbarians, con­ <lb/>
            tains the tumults of foolish princes and people. Antenor <lb/>
            gives his opinion for cutting off the cause of the war. What <lb/>
            does Paris ? He cannot be brought to comply, [though it be <lb/>
            in order] that he may reign safe, and live happy. Nestor <note type="footnote"> 15 This ridicule will appear in a stronger light by reading a passage of <lb/>
            Epietetus, which hath been preserved to us by Arrian. " Can there be a <lb/>
            providence," cries an Epicurean, " or could it suffer this continual <lb/>
            defluxion to torment me thus ?" " Slave as thou art," says Epicurus, <lb/>
            " why are you formed with hands ? Were they not given you to wipe <lb/>
            your nose?" "Yes; but were it not better," answers the disciple, <lb/>
            " that there was no such thing as phlegm in the world ?" " And is it <lb/>
            not better," replies Epicurus, " to wipe your nose, than deny the being <lb/>
            of providence ?" FRAN. </note><note type="footnote"> 18 Lollius, who was consul in the year 736, had two sons, one of whom <lb/>

            customs of many nations; and, while for himself and his as­ <lb/>

            the spacious sea, not to be sunk by all the waves of adversity. <lb/>
            You are well acquainted with the songs of the Sirens, and <lb/>
            Circe's cups : of which, if he had foolishly and greedily drunk <lb/>
            along with his attendants, he had been an ignominious and <lb/>
            senseless slave under the command of a prostitute: he had <lb/>
            lived a filthy dog, or a hog delighting in mire.</p>
          <p>We are a mere number, and born to consume the fruits of <lb/>
            the earth; like Penelope's suitors, useless drones; like Aid­ <lb/>
            nous' youth, employed above measure in pampering their bo­ <lb/>
            dies ; whose glory was to sleep till mid-day, and to lull their <lb/>
            cares to rest by the sound of the harp. Robbers rise by night, <lb/>
            that they may cut men's throats; and will not you awake to <lb/>
            save yourself? But, if you will not when you are in health, <lb/>
            you will be forced to take exercise when you are in a dropsy ; <lb/>
            and unless before day you call for a book with a light, unless <lb/>
            you brace your mind with study and honest employments, you <lb/>
            will be kept awake and tormented with envy or with love. <lb/>
            For why do you hasten to remove things that hurt your eyes, <lb/>
            but if any thing gnaws your mind, defer the time of curing it <lb/>
            from year to year? He has half the deed done, who has made <lb/>

            he thinks of enjoying the things which he has accumulated. <lb/>
            To him that is a slave to desire or to fear, house and estate <lb/>

            it turns sour. Despise pleasures: pleasure bought with pain <lb/>
            is hurtful. The covetous man is ever in want: set a certain <lb/>
            limit to your wishes. The envious person wastes at the <lb/>
            thriving condition of another: Sicilian tyrants 18 never in­ <lb/>
            vented a greater torment than envy. He who will not curb <lb/>
            his passion, will wish that undone which his grief and resent­ <lb/>
            ment suggested, while be violently plies his revenge with un­ <lb/>
            sated rancour. Rage is a short madness. Rule your passion, <lb/>
            which commands, if it do not obey; do you restrain it with a <lb/>
            bridle, and with fetters. The groom forms the docile horse, <lb/>
            while his neck is yet tender, to go the way which his rider <lb/>
            directs him : the young hound, from the time that he barked <lb/>
            at the deer's skin in the hall, campaigns it in the woods. Now, <lb/>

            to the tunic'd populace, and salutes him first. He pleads to <lb/>
            Philip his employment, and the confinement of his business, <lb/>
            in excuse for not having waited upon him in the morning; <lb/>
            and afterwards, for not seeing him first. " Expect that I <lb/>

            Mounted on horseback, he ceases not to cry up the Sabine <lb/>

            dissembler of my own power, and ready to serve myself alone. <lb/>
            So, avoiding the reproach of a greater fault, I have put in for <lb/>

          <p>When Mænius, having bravely made away with his paternal <lb/>
            and maternal estates, began to be accounted a merry fellow­ <lb/>
            a vagabond droll, who had no certain place of living; who, <lb/>
            when dinnerless, could not distinguish a fellow-citizen from <lb/>
            an enemy ; unmerciful in forging any scandal against any <lb/>
            person; the pest, and hurricane, and gulf of the market; <lb/>
            whatever he could get, he gave to his greedy gut. This fel­ <lb/>
            low, when he had extorted little or nothing from the favourers <lb/>
            of his iniquity, or those that dreaded it, would eat up whole <lb/>
            dishes of coarse tripe and lamb's entrails ; as much as would <lb/>
            have sufficed three bears ; then truly, [like] reformer Bestius,88 <lb/>

            to be branded with a red-hot iron. The same man [how­ <lb/>

            country-house :then declares that probity consists in the consciousness <lb/>
            of good works ; liberty, in probity.</p>
          <p>ASK me not, my best Quinctius, whether 'my farm maintains <lb/>
            its master with corn-fields, or enriches92 him with olives, or <lb/>
            with fruits, or meadow-land, or the elm-tree clothed with <lb/>
            vines: the shape and situation of my ground shall be described <lb/>
            to you at large.</p>
          <p>There is a continued range of mountains, except where­ <lb/>
            they are separated by a shadowy vale ; but in such a manner, <lb/>
            that the approaching sun views it on the right side, and de­ <lb/>
            parting in his flying car warms the left. You would com­ <lb/>
            mend its temperature. What ? If my [very] briers produce <lb/>
            in abundance the ruddy cornels and damsens ? If my oak <lb/>
            and holm-tree accommodate my cattle with plenty of acorns, <lb/>
            and their master with a copious shade ? You would say that <lb/>
            Tarentum, brought nearer [ to Rome], shone in its verdant <lb/>
            beauty. A fountain too, deserving to give name to a river, <lb/>
            insomuch that Hebrus does not surround Thrace more cool or <lb/>
            more limpid, flows salubrious to the infirm head, salubrious <note type="footnote"> 91 We may suppose, that Quinctius had often rallied our poet on the <lb/>
            situation, extent, and revenues of his estate. After having satisfied all his <lb/>
            questions in very few words, he throws himself into the moral, and <lb/>
            touches upon certain points, probably, of much importance to Quinctius ; <lb/>
            but all is pleasing, interesting, and instructive. The name of Augustus <lb/>
            in the twenty-ninth line is a proof, that the letter was written after the <lb/>

          <p>You live well, if you take care to support the character <lb/>
            which you bear. Long ago, all Rome has proclaimed you <lb/>
            happy: but I am apprehensive, lest you should give more <lb/>
            credit concerning yourself to any one than yourself ; and lest <lb/>
            you should imagine a man happy, who differs from the wise and <lb/>
            good; or, because the people pronounces you sound and per­ <lb/>
            fectly well, lest you dissemble the lurking fever at meal-times, <lb/>
            until a trembling seize your greased hands. The false modes­ <lb/>
            ty of fools conceals ulcers, [rather than have them cured]. If <lb/>
            any one should mention battles which you had fought by land <lb/>
            and sea, and in such expressions as these should soothe your <lb/>
            listening ears ; " May Jupiter, who consults the safety both <lb/>
            of you and of the city, keep it in doubt, whether the people <lb/>
            be more solicitous for your welfare, or yon for the people's;" <lb/>
            you might perceive these encomiums to belong [only] to Au­ <lb/>
            gustus : when you suffer yourself to be termed a philosopher, <lb/>
            and one of a refined life; say, pr'ythee, would you answer <lb/>
            [to these appellations] in your own name? To be sure—I <lb/>
            like to be called a wise and good man, as well as you. He <lb/>
            who gave this character to-day, if he will, can take it away <lb/>
            to-morrow: as the same people, if they have conferred the <lb/>
            consulship on an unworthy person, may take it away from <lb/>
            him : " Resign ; it is ours," they cry: I do resign it accord­ <lb/>
            ingly, and chagrined withdraw. Thus if they should call mo <lb/>
            rogue, deny me to be temperate, assert that I had strangled <lb/>
            my own father with a halter; shall I be stung, and change <lb/>
            colour at these false reproaches ? Whom does false honour <lb/>
            delight, or lying calumny terrify, except the vicious and sickly­ <lb/>
            minded ? Who then is a good man ? He who observes the <lb/>
            decrees of the senate, the laws and rules of justice ; by whose <lb/>
            arbitration many and important disputes are decided ; by <lb/>
            whose surety private property, and by whose testimony causes <lb/>
            are safe. Yet [perhaps] his own family and all the neighbour­ <lb/>
            hood observe this man, specious in a fair outside, [to be] pol­ <lb/>
            luted within. If a slave should say to me, " I have not coin­ <lb/>
            mitted a robbery, nor run away " You have your reward ; <lb/>
            you are not galled with the lash," I reply. " I have not killed <lb/>

            friend denies, and contradicts the fact. For the wary wolf <lb/>
            dreads the pitfall, and the hawk the suspected snares, and the <lb/>
            kite the concealed hook. The good, [on the contrary,] hate <lb/>
            to sin from the love of virtue; you will commit no crime <lb/>
            merely for the fear of punishment. Let there be a prospect <lb/>
            of escaping, you will confound sacred and profane things to­ <lb/>
            gether. For, when from a thousand bushels of beans you <lb/>
            filch one, the loss in that case to me is less, but not your vil­ <lb/>
            lany. The honest man, whom every forum and every court <lb/>
            of justice looks upon with reverence, whenever he makes an <lb/>

            pronounced in a clear distinguishable voice, " 0 father Janus, <lb/>

            appearance of a just and upright man : throw a cloud of <lb/>
            night over my frauds." I do not see how a covetous man <lb/>
            can be better, how more free than a slave, when he stoops <lb/>
            down for the sake of a penny, stuck in the road [for sport].94 <lb/>
            For he who will be covetous, will also be anxious : but he that <lb/>
            lives in a state of anxiety, will never in my estimation be free. <lb/>
            He who is always in a hurry, and immersed in the study of <lb/>
            augmenting his fortune, has lost the arms, and deserted the <lb/>
            post of virtue. Do not kill your captive, if you can sell him : <lb/>
            he will serve you advantageously: let him, being inured to <lb/>
            drudgery, feed [your cattle], and plough ; let him go to sea, <lb/>
            and winter in the midst of the waves; let him be of use to <lb/>

              Miletus with greater aversion than [the bite of] do- or viper: <lb/>
              he will die with cold,5 unless you restore him his ragged gar­ <lb/>

              perform exploits, and show the citizens their foes in chains, <lb/>
              reaches the throne of Jupiter, and aims at celestial honours. <lb/>
              To have been acceptable to the great, is not the last of praises. <lb/>
              It is not every man's lot to gain Corinth.6 He [prudently] <lb/>
              sat still, who was afraid lest he should not succeed: be it so ; <lb/>
              what then? Was it not bravely done by him, who carried his <lb/>
              point ? Either here therefore, or no where, is what we are in­ <lb/>
              vestigating. The one dreads the burden, as too much for a <lb/>
              pusillanimous soul and a weak constitution; the other under- <lb/>
              takes, and carries it through. Either virtue is an empty <lb/>
              name,7 or the man who makes the experiment deservedly <lb/>
              claims the honour and the reward. <note type="footnote"> The man who carries a cudgel, wears a double coat, and feeds upon air. <lb/>
              This last expression means a sophist, who, according to Aristophanes, <lb/>
              lives upon the clouds. However, Horace probably meant only a double <lb/>
              mantle, or one as thick as two ; a coarse, heavy coat, in opposition to <lb/>
              purpureum amictum. Servius explains duplicem ex humeris rejecit amic­ <lb/>
              tum, in Virgil, in the same manner. ED. DUBL. </note><note type="footnote"> 5 Aristippus engaged Diogenes to go with him into the bath, and, <lb/>
              coming first out of the water, took the cynic's mantle, and left him his <lb/>
              purple robe. But Diogenes declared he would rather go naked out of <lb/>
              the bath than put it on. DAC. </note><note type="footnote"> 6 Suidas informs us, that the danger and difficulty of going into the <lb/>
              ports of Corinth gave rise to a proverb. Horace makes use of it, to show <lb/>
              that all people have not talents proper for succeeding in a court, and to <lb/>
              raise the glory of those who have courage to attempt and address to con­ <lb/>
              quer the difficulties there. Others apply the proverb to Lais, a famous <lb/>
              Corinthian courtezan; but such an application is too light and trivial for <lb/>
              the solemnity of these lines, nor is it just to the poet's thought. If money <lb/>
              could purchase her favours, it required no great degree of courage to at­ <lb/>
              tempt them. SAN. </note><note type="footnote"> 7 This is the decision which necessarily results from the proofs. The <lb/>
              poet introduces a person, who may be supposed to object that, if it be so <lb/>
              difficult to succeed at court, a wise man had better not attempt it. " Se­ <lb/>
              dit, qui timuit." Horace acknowledges the force of this objection, "esto." <lb/>
              but draws from it a very different conclusion; that, if there be difficulty <lb/>
              or danger, he certainly deserves the highest praise who tries to succeed, <lb/>
              "experiens vir;" and, if virtue be any thing more than a chimerical <lb/>
              name, he may with justice claim a reward proportionable to his merit, <lb/>
              " rectè petit." ED. DUBL. </note> <pb n="265"/>

            lord, will gain more than the importunate. There is a great <lb/>
            difference between modestly accepting, or seizing by violence. <lb/>
            But this was the principle and source of every thing, [which <lb/>
            I alleged]. He who says, " My sister is without a portion, <lb/>
            my mother poor, and my estate neither saleable nor sufficient <lb/>
            for my support," cries out [in effect], " Give me a morsel of <lb/>
            bread:" another whines, "And let the platter be carved out <lb/>
            for me with half a share of the bounty."8 But if the crow <lb/>
            could have fed in silence, he would have had better fare, and <lb/>
            much less of quarrelling and of envy.</p>
          <p>A companion taken [by his lord] to Brundusium, or the <lb/>
            pleasant Surrentum, who complains of the ruggedness of the <lb/>
            roads and the bitter cold and rains, or laments that his chest <lb/>
            is broken open and his provisions stolen ; resembles the well- <lb/>
            known tricks of an harlot, weeping frequently for her neck­ <lb/>
            lace, frequently for a garter forcibly taken from her ; so that <lb/>
            at length no credit is given to her real griefs and losses. Nor <lb/>
            does he, who has been once ridiculed in the streets, care to <lb/>
            lift up a vagrant9 with a [pretended] broken leg; though <lb/>
            abundant tears should flow from him ; though, swearing by <lb/>
            holy Osiris,10 he says, "Believe me, I do not impose upon <lb/>
            you ; 0 cruel, take up the lame." " Seek out for a stranger," 11 <lb/>
            cries the hoarse neighbourhood. <note type="footnote"> 8 This importunate not only teases his patron with perpetual requests, <lb/>
            but provokes others to make the same demands. The poet compares them <lb/>
            to beggars in the street, and gives the same language, for " quadra " sig­ <lb/>

          <p>IF I rightly know your temper, most ingenuous Lollius, you <lb/>
            will beware of imitating a flatterer, while you profess yourself <lb/>
            a friend. As a matron is unlike and of a different aspect <lb/>
            from a strumpet, so will a true friend differ from the toad­ <lb/>
            eater. There is an opposite vice to this, rather the greater <lb/>
            [of the two] ; a clownish, inelegant, and disagreeable blunt­ <lb/>
            ness, which would recommend itself by an unshaven face and <lb/>
            black teeth; while it desires to be termed pure freedom and <lb/>
            true sincerity. Virtue is the medium of the two vices ; and <lb/>
            equally remote from either. The one is over-prone to coin­ <lb/>
            plaisance, and a jester of the lowest couch,12 he so reverences <lb/>
            the rich man's nod, so repeats his speeches, and catches up his <lb/>
            falling words ; that you would take him for a school-boy say­ <lb/>
            ing his lesson to a rigid master, or a player acting an under­ <lb/>
            part: another often wrangles about a goat's hair, and armed <lb/>
            engages 13 for any trifle: " That I, truly, should not have the <lb/>
            first credit; and that I should not boldly speak aloud, what is <lb/>
            my real sentiment-[ upon such terms,] another life would be <lb/>
            of no value." But what is the subject of this controversy? <lb/>
            Why, whether [the gladiator] Castor or Dolichos be the cle­ <lb/>
            verer fellow ; whether the Minucian,14 or the Appian, be the <lb/>
            better road to Brundusium ? <note type="footnote"> 12 Imi derisor lecti, i. e. a buffoon, who is invited to an entertainment <lb/>

            whom a shame and aversion to poverty possess, his rich <lb/>

            himself; and says what is nearly true: "My riches (think <lb/>

            the twins, Zethus and Amphion, broke off; till the lyre, dis­ <lb/>
            liked by the austere brother, was silent. Amphion is thought <lb/>
            to have given way to his brother's humours; so do you yield <lb/>
            to the gentle dictates of your friend in power : as often as he <lb/>
            leads forth his dogs into the fields and his cattle laden with <lb/>

            especially when you are in health, and are able either to excel <lb/>

            some years in Galatia, where he was governor after the death of Amyn­ <lb/>

            returned to Rome in 732, and entered upon his consulship in the begin­ <lb/>

            Timagenes was a rhetorician of Alexandria, who, having provoked All­ <lb/>
            gustus by too great a freedom of raillery, was forbidden to enter the <lb/>
            palace. In resentment of such an affront he burned a history which he <lb/>

            some particular measure, and if we may judge from the fragments of the <lb/>

            Canidia, Cassius Severus, and some others, must acknowledge that <lb/>
            Horace had but too well imitated the satire and severity of Archilochus, <lb/>
            although he did not servilely follow his expressions, or allow himself that <lb/>

          <p>Would you know why the ungrateful reader extols and is <lb/>
            fond of my works at home, unjustly decries them without <lb/>
            doors ? I hunt not after the applause of the inconstant vul­ <lb/>
            gar, at the expense of entertainments, and for the bribe of a <lb/>
            worn-out coat: I am not an auditor of noble writers, nor a <lb/>
            vindictive reciter, nor condescend to court30 the tribes and <lb/>
            desks of the grammarians. Hence are these tears. If I say <lb/>
            that " I am ashamed to repeat my worthless writings to <lb/>
            crowded theatres, and give an air of consequence to trifles :" <lb/>
            " You ridicule us," says [one of them], " and you reserve those <lb/>
            pieces for the ears of Jove: you are confident that it is you <lb/>
            alone who can distil the poetic honey, beautiful in your own <lb/>
            eyes." At these words I am afraid to turn up my nose ; and <lb/>
            lest I should be torn by the acute nails of my adversary, <lb/>
            " This place is disagreeable," I cry out, " and I demand a <note type="footnote"> less harmonious than those of Alcæus or Sappho. They took from <lb/>
            him several sorts of verse for their odes, and Horace, by their example, <lb/>
            hath taken from each of them whatever might enrich his Latin Lyric <lb/>
            poetry. SAN. </note><note type="footnote"> 29 Horace can only mean Alcæus. He hath already said he was the <lb/>
            first Roman who had imitated in Latin the iambics of Archilochus, and <lb/>
            it were ridiculous to repeat it within eight or nine verses. When he <lb/>
            says, " Latinus fidicen," he not only marks his being a Lyric poet him­ <lb/>
            self, but that the writer whom he had imitated was so likewise, which <lb/>
            cannot be said of Archilochus, who was never reckoned in their number. <lb/>
            This reason will be more sensible, if we examine the different expressions <lb/>
            of Horace with attention. He tells us that he was the first Roman Lyric <lb/>
            poet who had imitated Alcæus, " hune ego, non alia dictum priùs ore, <lb/>
            Latinus fidicen ;" and ten verses before this he says he was the first who <lb/>
            showed the iambics of Archilochus to the Latins, " Parios ego primus <lb/>
            iambos ostendi Latio." It is remarkable, that although Horace did not <lb/>
            imitate Sappho less than Archilochus and Alcæus, yet he does not say he <lb/>
            was the first of the Romans, because Catullus and some other Latin <lb/>
            poets had written Sapphic verses before him. BENT. </note><note type="footnote"> 30 Horace laughs at the meanness of a bad poet who pays his court to <lb/>

            presages his book should be banished in its old age. This prediction <lb/>
            should be considered as a modest pleasantry, for our poet knew too well <lb/>

            very sensible to cold: that in winter he went to the sea-coast, and that <lb/>
            he was particularly fond of Tarentum in that season, because it was <lb/>
            milder there. We may likewise understand the words of his exercises <lb/>

            addressed any part of his works to him. Know, says he, that I am angry <lb/>
            with you; or are you apprehensive it shall injure your reputation with <lb/>
            posterity, that you have been one of my friends ? These reproaches, <lb/>
            probably, occasioned this Epistle, which is justly ranked among the best <lb/>
            performances of our author, and not unworthy of a prince of superior <lb/>
            genius, delicate taste, and more than common erudition. It may be <lb/>
            divided into four parts. In the first, the poet examines the comparison <lb/>
            between ancients and moderns, which hath been a matter of dispute in <lb/>
            almost all ages. He then shows, that novelty is the mother of all polite <lb/>
            arts, especially of poetry, that divine art, which deserves the greatest <lb/>
            praises and greatest rewards. In the third part he treats of the theatre, <lb/>
            and the difficulty of succeeding there. In the last, he would inform <lb/>
            princes how much they are interested to animate an emulation among <lb/>
            Epic and Lyric poets, who have it in their power to make them immortal. <lb/>
            These different parts are enlivened by a continual criticism upon the <lb/>
            manner in which the Romans judged of poets, and by many reflections, <lb/>
            equally useful and agreeable, upon the origin and progress of poetry. </note><note type="footnote"> The date of this Epistle is determined by so many facts, and so strongly <lb/>
            marked, that it is unaccountable how it hath been mistaken. It mentions <lb/>
            the divine honours paid to Augustus in 726: the sovereign authority <lb/>
            which he received from the senate in 727: the reduction of the Parthians <lb/>
            in 734 : the laws which he made for the reformation of manners in 737 : <lb/>
            the conquests of Tiberius and Drusus in 739, 742, 743. and shutting the <lb/>
            temple of Janus in 744, when this letter was written, and when Horace <lb/>

          <p>Romulus, and father Bacchus, and Castor and Pollux, after <lb/>

            proportion to their merits. lIe who crushed the dire Hydra, <lb/>
            and subdued the renowned monsters by his forefated labour, <lb/>
            found envy was to be tamed by death [alone]. For he burns <lb/>

            arts beneath him :3 after his decease, he shall be had in lion- <note type="footnote"> 2 The poet is thought to begin with apologizing for the shortness of this <lb/>
            Epistle. And yet it is one of the longest he ever wrote. How is this incon­ <lb/>
            sistency to be reconciled ? The case, I believe, was this. The genius of <lb/>
            epistolary writing demands, that the subject-matter be not abruptly deli­ <lb/>
            vered, or hastily obtruded on the person addressed ; but, as the law of <lb/>
            decorum prescribes, (for the rule holds in writing, as in conversation,) be <lb/>
            gradually and respectfully introduced to him. This obtains more par­ <lb/>
            ticularly in applications to the great, and on important subjects. But now <lb/>
            the poet, being to address his prince on a point of no small delicacy, and <lb/>
            on which he foresaw he should have occasion to hold him pretty long, <lb/>
            prudently contrives to get as soon as possible into his subject; and, to <lb/>
            that end, hath the art to convert the very transgression of this rule into <lb/>
            the justest and most beautiful compliment. </note><note type="footnote"> That cautious preparation, which is ordinarily requisite in our ap­ <lb/>
            proaches to greatness, had been, the poet observes, in the present case, <lb/>
            highly unseasonable, as the business and interests of the empire must, in <lb/>
            the mean time, have stood still and been suspended. By sermone, then, <lb/>
            we are to understand, not the body of the Epistle, but the proem or in­ <lb/>
            troduction only. The body, as of public concern, might be allowed to <lb/>
            engage, at full length, the emperor's attention ; but the introduction, con­ <lb/>
            sisting of ceremonial only, the common good required him to shorten as <lb/>
            much as possible. It was no time for using an insignificant preamble, or, <lb/>
            in our English phrase, of making long speeches. This reason, too, is <lb/>
            founded, not merely in the elevated rank of the emperor, but in the pe­ <lb/>
            culiar diligence and solicitude with which, history tells us, he endea­ <lb/>
            voured to promote, by various ways, the interests of his country. So that <lb/>
            the compliment is as just as it is polite. It may be further observed, that <lb/>
            sermo is used in Horace to signify the ordinary style of conversation, (see <lb/>
            I Sat. 3, 65, and 4, 42,) and therefore not improperly denotes the fami­ <lb/>
            liarity of the epistolary address, which, in its easy expression, so nearly <lb/>
            approaches to it. HURD. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 I have partly followed Anthon, but the variety of interpretations in <lb/>

            height, in the tyranny of J. Cæsar. Balbus, in a letter to Cicero (Ep. ad <lb/>

            Cæsare, moriar." And Dio tells us (L. xliv.) that it was, by the express <lb/>
            injunction of the senate, decreed, even in Cæsar’s life-time, that the Ro­ <lb/>

            from the same writer, L. xliii.) upon the receiving the news of his defeat <lb/>

            it does wine, I would fain know how many years will stamp <lb/>
            a value upon writings. A writer who died a hundred years <lb/>
            ago, is he to be reckoned among the perfect and ancient, or <lb/>
            among the mean and modern authors? Let some fixed period <lb/>

            pletes a hundred years. What! one that died a month or a <lb/>
            year later, among whom is he to be ranked ? Among the old <note type="footnote"> turn of his argument confines us to this sense. For he would show the <lb/>
            folly of concluding the same of the old Roman writers, on their first rude <lb/>
            attempts to copy the finished models of Greece, as of the old Greek writ­ <lb/>
            ers themselves, who were furnished with the means of producing those <lb/>
            models by long discipline and cultivation. This appears, certainly, from <lb/>
            what follows: <lb/>
            " Venimus ad summum fortune : pingimus atque <lb/>

            The design of which hath been entirely overlooked; for it hath been <lb/>
            taken only for a general expression of falsehood and absurdity, of just the <lb/>

            "Nil intra est oleam, nil extra est in nuce duri." <lb/>

            tion of the very absurdity in question, and to show the maintainers of it, <lb/>
            from the nature of things, how senseless their position was. It is to this <lb/>
            purpose : " As well may it be pretended that we Romans surpass the <lb/>
            Greeks in the arts of painting, music, and the exercises of the palæstra, <lb/>
            which yet it is confessed we do not, as that our old writers surpass the <lb/>
            modern. The absurdity, in either case, is the same. For, as the Greeks, <lb/>
            who had long devoted themselves, with great and continued application, <lb/>
            to the practice of these arts. (which is the force of the epithet uncti, here <lb/>
            given them,) must for that reason carry the prize from the Romans, who <lb/>
            have taken very little pains about them; so, the modem Romans, who <lb/>
            have for a long time been studying the arts of poetry and composition, <lb/>
            must needs excel the old Roman writers, who had little or no acquaint­ <lb/>

          <p>Yet how great advantages this error and this slight mad­ <lb/>

            flights of slaves, fires; he contrives no fraud against his <lb/>

            performed to Jupiter to implore rain. The people walked bare-footed <lb/>

            to reduce the god to a necessity of hearing them, they rolled a great stone, <lb/>
            called lapis manalis, through the streets, being persuaded it had a virtue <lb/>
            of bringing down rain. But the priests never brought forth this miracu­ <lb/>
            lous stone, until they were tolerably well assured of the success. Tages <lb/>
            and Baccis, Bœotian and Etruscan soothsayers, had remarked, that the <lb/>

          <p>Our ancient swains, stout and happy-with a little, after the <lb/>

            of their ending, with their slaves and faithful wife, the part­ <lb/>

            Earth, with milk Silvanus, with flowers and wine the genius <lb/>
            that reminds us of our short life. Invented by this custom, <lb/>
            the Fescennine22 licentiousness poured forth its rustic taunts <lb/>
            in alternate stanzas ; and this liberty, received down through <lb/>
            revolving years, sported pleasingly; till at length the bitter <lb/>
            raillery began to be turned into open rage, and threatening <lb/>
            with impunity to stalk through reputable families. They, who <lb/>
            suffered from its bloody tooth, smarted with the pain; the <lb/>
            unhurt likewise were concerned for the common condition: <lb/>
            further also, a law and a penalty23 were enacted, which for­ <lb/>
            bade that any one should be stigmatized in lampoon. Through <lb/>
            fear of the bastinado, they were reduced to the necessity of <lb/>
            changing their manner, and of praising and delighting.</p>

            marriage festivals especially, were not ashamed of licentious and obscene <lb/>
            expressions in the verses pronounced on such occasions. When the <lb/>
            Romans began to form their stage, as the Tuscans were famous for dancing, <lb/>
            and theatrical representations, a company of them were sent for to Rome in <lb/>
            the year 342. They did not speak, because the Romans did not under­ <lb/>
            stand their language, but they supplied their want of speech by a kind of <lb/>
            dumb declamation. By their dancing, gesture, and movements, regulated <lb/>
            by the sound of the flute, they presented every thought and sentiment to <lb/>
            the eyes of the spectators. From these beginnings the Roman theatre <lb/>

            the faults which the best theatrical poets have committed. Plautus, <lb/>

            happy in his characters, which are generally either too tame, or too much <lb/>

            an unworthy poet. A favourite of king Alexander the <lb/>
            Great34 was that Chœrilus, who to his uncouth and ill-formed <lb/>
            verses owed the many pieces he received of Philip's royal <note type="footnote"> 33 Ædituos. Since the time that Augustus had received divine hon­ <lb/>
            ours, our poet looked upon his actions as things sacred. His virtue is <lb/>
            now become a goddess, and hath a temple consecrated to her, and poets <lb/>
            are the guardians of it and of its mysteries. Such is the meaning of <lb/>
            Ædituos. FRAN. </note><note type="footnote"> 34 This praise of Augustus, arising from the comparison of his charac­ <lb/>
            ter with that of Alexander, is extremely fine. It has been observed of <lb/>
            the Macedonian, by his historians and panegyrists, that to the stern virtues <lb/>
            of the conqueror he had joined the softer accomplishments of the virtu­ <lb/>

            other, from his famous edict concerning Apelles and Lysippus, could not <lb/>
            be denied. Horace finds means to turn both these circumstances in his <lb/>
            story to the advantage of his prince. </note><note type="footnote"> From his extravagant pay of such a wretched versifier as Chœrilus, he <lb/>
            would insinuate, that Alexander's love of the muse was, in fact, but a <lb/>
            blind, unintelligent impulse towards glory. And, from his greater skill <lb/>
            in the arts of sculpture and of painting than of verse, he represents him <lb/>
            as more concerned about the drawing of his figure than the portraiture <lb/>
            of his manners and mind. Whereas Augustus, by his liberalities to Varins <lb/>

            pected immortality; and, in trusting to that as the chief instrument of <lb/>
            his fame, had confessed a prior regard to those mental virtues which are <lb/>

            ridiculous a poem, by an edict forbade that any one beside <lb/>
            Apelles should paint him, or that any other than Lysippus <lb/>

            the Bœotians. Yet neither do Virgil and Varius, your be­ <lb/>

            which they have received with great honour to the donor; <lb/>

            when expressed by statues of brass, than their manners and <lb/>
            minds expressed by the works of a poet. Nor would I rather <lb/>
            compose such tracts as these creeping on the ground, than <lb/>

            for sale, which he wants to put off. No emergency obliges <lb/>
            me [to dispose of him] : though poor, I am in nobody's debt. <lb/>
            None of the chapmen would do this for you ; nor should every <lb/>

            with stores. Famous on account of this exploit, he is adorned <lb/>
            with honourable rewards, and receives twenty thousand ses­ <lb/>

            encourage the same man, with words that might even have <lb/>
            given courage to a coward : " Go, my brave fellow, whither <lb/>

            pearance of one at play; and will be [in his invention] on <lb/>
            the rack, like [a dancer on the stage], who one while affects <lb/>
            the motions of a satyr, at another of a clumsy cyclops.</p>
          <p>I had rather be esteemed a foolish and dull writer, while <lb/>
            my faults please myself, or at least escape my notice, than be <lb/>
            wise and smart for it. There lived at Argos a man of no <lb/>
            mean rank, who imagined that he was hearing some admir­ <lb/>
            able tragedians, a joyful sitter and applauder in an empty <lb/>
            theatre: who [nevertheless] could support the other duties of <lb/>
            life in a just manner; a truly honest neighbour, an amiable <lb/>
            host, kind toward his wife, one who could pardon his slaves, <lb/>
            nor would rave at the breaking of a bottle-seal: one who <lb/>
            [had sense enough] to avoid a precipice, or an open well. <lb/>
            This man, being cured at the expense and by the care of his <lb/>
            relations, when he had expelled by the means of pure helle­ <lb/>
            bore the disorder and melancholy humour, and returned to <lb/>
            himself; " By Pollux, my friends, (said he,) you have de­ <lb/>
            stroyed, not saved me; from whom my pleasure is thus taken <lb/>
            away, and a most agreeable delusion of mind removed by <lb/>
            force."</p>
          <p>In a word, it is of the first consequence to be wise in the <lb/>
            rejection of trifles, and leave childish play to boys for whom <lb/>
            it is in season, and not to scan words to be set to music for <lb/>
            the Roman harps, but [rather] to be perfectly an adept in the <lb/>
            numbers and proportions of real life. Thus therefore I com­ <lb/>
            mune with myself, and ponder these things in silence: "If <lb/>
            no quantity of water would put an end to your thirst, you <lb/>
            would tell it to your physicians. And is there none to whom <lb/>
            you dare confess, that the more you get, the more you crave ? <lb/>
            If you had a wound, which was not relieved by a plant or <lb/>
            root prescribed to you, you would refuse being doctored <lb/>
            with a root or plant that did no good. You have heard <lb/>
            that vicious folly left the man, on whom the gods conferred <pb n="296"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK II. </note> <lb/>
            wealth ; and though you are nothing wiser, since you became <lb/>
            richer, will you nevertheless use the same monitors as before ? <lb/>
            But could riches make you wise, could they make you less <lb/>
            covetous and mean-spirited, you well might blush, if there <lb/>
            lived on earth one more avaricious than yourself."</p>
          <p>If that be any man's property which he has bought by the <lb/>
            pound and penny,50 [and] there be some things to which (if <lb/>
            you give credit to the lawyers) possession gives a claim,51 <lb/>
            [then] the field that feeds you is your own ; and Orbius' <lb/>
            steward, when he harrows the corn which is soon to give you <lb/>
            flour, finds you are [in effect] the proper master. You give <lb/>
            your money; you receive grapes, pullets, eggs, a hogshead of <lb/>
            strong wine: certainly in this manner you by little and little <lb/>
            purchase that farm, for which perhaps the owner paid three <lb/>
            hundred thousand sesterces, or more. What does it signify, <lb/>
            whether you live on what was paid for the other day, or a <lb/>
            long while ago ? He who purchased the Aricinian and Vei­ <lb/>
            entine fields some time since, sups on bought vegetables, how­ <lb/>
            ever he may think otherwise ; boils his pot with bought wood <lb/>
            at the approach of the chill evening. But he calls all that <lb/>
            his own, as far as where the planted poplar prevents quarrels <lb/>
            among neighbours by a determinate limitation: as if any <lb/>
            thing were a man's property, which in a moment of the fleet­ <lb/>
            ing hour, now by solicitations, now by sale, now by violence, <lb/>
            and now by the supreme lot [of all men], may change masters, <lb/>
            and come into another's jurisdiction. Thus since the per­ <lb/>
            petual possession is given to none, and one man's heir urges <lb/>
            on another's, as wave impels wave, of what importance are <lb/>
            houses, or granaries; or what the Lucanian pastures joined <lb/>
            to the Calabrian; if Hades, inexorable to gold, mows down <lb/>

          <p>IF a painter 1 should wish to unite a horse's neck to a human <lb/>
            head, and spread a variety of plumage over limbs [of different <lb/>
            animals] taken from every part [of nature],2 so that what is <lb/>
            a beautiful woman in the upper part terminates unsightly in <lb/>
            an ugly fish below; could you, my friends, refrain from <note type="footnote"> 1 All that our poet says here may be referred, in general, to three <lb/>
            heads, the fable, the manners, and the diction. We should take notice <lb/>
            that this piece particularly regards epic and dramatic poetry, and that our <lb/>
            author only occasionally mentions any other kind. </note><note type="footnote"> The most important precept for the composition of a poem is unity and <lb/>
            simplicity of design. There should be only one action, to which all the <lb/>
            incidents ought to refer ; and this point of perfection, every regular work <lb/>
            requires. To show the necessity of this rule, Horace compares an irre­ <lb/>
            gular poem to pictures formed by a wild assortment of many parts en­ <lb/>
            tirely unlike each other. Every part, considered in itself, may have its pro­ <lb/>
            per, natural perfection, while their union produces nothing but what is <lb/>
            monstrous and ridiculous. FRAN. </note><note type="footnote"> The critic's rules must be taken either, I. from the general standing <lb/>
            laws of composition; or, 2. from the peculiar ones, appropriated to the <lb/>
            kind. Now the direction to be fetched from the former of these sources <lb/>
            will of course precede, as well on account of its superior dignity, as that <lb/>
            the mind itself delights to descend from universals to the consideration of <lb/>
            particulars. Agreeably to this rule of nature, the poet, having to correct, <lb/>
            in the Roman drama, these three points, 1. a misconduct in the disposi­ <lb/>
            tion ; 2. an abuse of language ; and, 3. a disregard of the peculiar cha­ <lb/>
            racters and colourings of its different species, hath chosen to do this oil <lb/>
            principles of universal nature; which, while they include the case of the <lb/>
            drama, at the same time extend to poetic composition nt large. Those <lb/>
            prefatory, universal observations being delivered, he then proceeds, with <lb/>
            advantage, to the second source of this art, viz. the consideration of the <lb/>
            laws and rules peculiar to the kind. HURD. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 But Orelli more rightly treats " collatis membris "as the ablative <lb/>

            Pisos, the book will be perfectly like such a picture, the ideas <lb/>
            of which, like a sick man's dreams, are all vain and fictitious: <lb/>
            so that neither head nor foot can correspond to any one form. <lb/>
            " Poets and painters [you will say] have ever had equal au­ <lb/>
            thority for attempting any thing." We are conscious of this, <lb/>
            and this privilege we demand and allow in turn: but not to <lb/>
            such a degree, that the tame should associate with the savage; <lb/>
            nor that serpents should be coupled with birds, lambs with <lb/>
            tigers.</p>
          <p>In pompous introductions,3 and such as promise a great <lb/>
            deal, it generally happens that one or two verses of purple <lb/>
            patch-work, that may make a great show, are tagged on; as <lb/>
            when the grove and the altar of Diana and the meandering of <lb/>
            a current hastening through pleasant fields, or the river <lb/>
            Rhine, or the rainbow is described. But here there was no <lb/>
            room for these [fine things] : perhaps, too, you know how to <lb/>
            draw a cypress: 4 but what is that to the purpose, if he, who <lb/>
            is painted for the given price, is [to be represented as] swim­ <lb/>

            position at large, have been thought to glance more particularly at the <lb/>
            epic poetry which was not improper: for, 1. the drama which he was <lb/>
            about to criticize, had its rise and origin from the epos. Thus we are told <lb/>
            by the great critic, that Homer was the first who invented dramatic imi­ <lb/>
            tations, <foreign xml:lang="grc">μόνος</foreign>—<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅτι μιμήσεις δϱαματικὰς ἐποίησε</foreign>. 2. The several ccn­ <lb/>
            sures, here pointed at the epic, would bear still more directly against the <lb/>
            tragic poem ; it being more glaringly inconsistent with the genius of the <lb/>
            drama to admit of foreign and digressive ornaments, than of the extended, <lb/>
            episodical epopœia. For both these reasons, it was altogether pertinent <lb/>
            to the poet's purpose, in a criticism on the drama, to expose the vicious <lb/>
            practice of the epic models. Though, to preserve the unity of his piece, <lb/>
            and for a further reason, (see note on v. 1,) he hath artfully done this <lb/>
            under the cover of general criticism. HURD. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Boughs of cypress were carried in funeral processions, and placed <lb/>

            drawing a tree for which there was such demand; and he therefore <lb/>

          <p>The great majority of us poets, father, and youths worthy <lb/>
            such a father, are misted by the appearance of right. I labour <lb/>

            that aims at the easy: one, that pretends to be sublime, proves <lb/>

            crawls along the ground: he who wants to vary his subject <lb/>

            how to finish a complete piece. I would no more choose to <lb/>

            than to live with a distorted nose, [though] remarkable for <lb/>
            black eyes and jetty hair.</p>
          <p>Ye who write, make choice of a subject suitable to your <lb/>
            abilities; and revolve in your thoughts a considerable time <lb/>
            what your strength7 declines, and what it is able to support. <lb/>
            Neither elegance of style, nor a perspicuous disposition, shall <lb/>
            desert the man, by whom the subject matter is chosen ju­ <lb/>
            diciously. <note type="footnote"> 5 The word prodigialiter apparently refers to that fictitious monster, <lb/>
            under which the poet allusively shadows out the idea of absurd and in­ <lb/>
            consistent composition. The application, however, differs in this, that, <lb/>
            whereas the monster, there painted, was intended to expose the extrava­ <lb/>
            gance of putting together incongruous parts, without any reference to a <lb/>
            whole, this prodigy is designed to characterize a whole, but deformed by <lb/>
            the ill-judged position of its parts. The former is like a monster, whose <lb/>
            several members, as of right belonging to different animals, could by no <lb/>
            disposition be made to constitute one consistent animal. The other, like <lb/>
            a landscape which hath no objects absolutely irrelative, or irreducible to <lb/>
            a whole, but which a wrong position of the parts only renders prodigious. <lb/>

            painter might show them both on the same canvass. </note><note type="footnote"> Each is a violation of the law of unity, and a real monster : the one, <lb/>
            because it contains an assemblage of natural incoherent parts ; the other, <lb/>

          <p>This, or I am mistaken, will constitute the merit and <lb/>
            beauty of arrangement, that the poet just now say what <lb/>
            ought just now to be said, put off most of his thoughts, and <lb/>
            waive them for the present.</p>
          <p>In the choice of his words, too, the author of the projected <lb/>

            cinctus instead of the tunic, as appears to have been the custom of the <lb/>
            ancient Romans. This was a vest which passed round the waist, and <lb/>
            extended down to the feet. That it was an ancient vesture may appear <lb/>
            from its being used by the Luperci. Comp. Ovid. Fast. v. 101. As it <lb/>
            did not embarrass the motion of the arms, even after the tunic became <lb/>
            part of the dress, it was sometimes substituted for it by those who had <lb/>
            occasion to use much bodily exertion. Hence cinctutis is supposed by <lb/>
            some to have a meaning here similar to that of succinetus, " active, in­ <lb/>

            in familiar verses, and such as almost suit the sock. Let <note type="footnote"> 15 Indignatur item, &amp;c.—Cœna Thyestœs. " II met le souper de Thyeste <lb/>
            pour toutes sortes de tragedies," says M. Dacier, with whom agrees the <lb/>
            whole band of commentators: but why this subject should be singled out, <lb/>
            as the representative of the rest, is no where explained by any of them. <lb/>
            We may be sure, it was not taken up at random. The reason was, that <lb/>
            the Thyestes of Ennius was peculiarly chargeable with the fault here <lb/>
            censured ; as is plain from a curious passage in the Orator, where Cicero, <lb/>
            speaking of the loose numbers of certain poets, observes this, in particular, <lb/>
            of the tragedy of Thyestes, " Similia sunt quædam apud nostros: velut <lb/>
            in Thyeste, <lb/>
            Quemnam te esse dicam ? qui tardâ in senectute, <lb/>
            et quæ sequuntur : quæ, nisi cùm tibicen accesserit, oratione sunt solute <lb/>
            simillimæ:" which character exactly agrees to this of Horace, wherein <lb/>
            the language of that play is censured, as flat and prosaic, and hardly <lb/>
            rising above the plain narrative of an ordinary conversation in comedy. <lb/>
            This allusion to a particular play, written by one of their best poets, and <lb/>
            frequently exhibited on the Roman stage, gives great force and spirit to <lb/>
            the precept, at the same time that it exemplifies it in the happiest man­ <lb/>
            ner. It seems further probable to me, that the poet also designed an in­ <lb/>
            direct compliment to Varius, whose Thyestes we are told (Quinctil. l. x. <lb/>
            c. 1) was not inferior to any tragedy of the Greeks. This double inten­ <lb/>
            tion of these lines well suited to the poet's general aim, which is seen <lb/>
            through all his critical works, of beating down the excessive admiration <lb/>
            of the old poets, and of asserting and advancing the just honours of the <lb/>
            deserving moderns. It may further be observed, that the critics have not <lb/>
            felt the force of the words exponi and narrari in this precept. They are <lb/>
            admirably chosen to express the two faults condemned: the first imply­ <lb/>
            ing a kind of pomp and ostentation in the language, which is therefore <lb/>
            improper for the low subjects of comedy ; and the latter, as I have hinted, <lb/>
            a flat, prosaic expression, not above the cast of a common narrative, and <lb/>
            therefore equally unfit for tragedy. HURD. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="305"/>
            each peculiar species [of writing] fill with decorum its proper <lb/>
            place. Nevertheless sometimes even comedy exalts her voice, <lb/>
            and passionate Chremes rails in a tumid strain: and a tragic <lb/>
            writer generally expresses grief it! a prosaic style. Telephus j <lb/>
            and Peleus, when they are both in poverty and exile, throw <lb/>
            aside their rants and gigantic expressions if they have a mind <lb/>
            to move the heart of the spectator with their complaint.</p>
          <p>It is not enough, that poems be beautiful;16 let them be <lb/>
            tender and affecting, and bear away the soul of the auditor <lb/>
            whithersoever they please. As the human countenance smiles <lb/>
            on those that smile, so does it sympathize with those that <lb/>
            weep. If you would have me weep you must first express <lb/>
            the passion of grief yourself; then, Telephus or Peleus, your <lb/>
            misfortunes hurt me: if you pronounce the parts assigned <lb/>
            you ill, I shall either fall asleep or laugh.</p>
          <p>Pathetic accents suit a melancholy countenance ; words full <lb/>
            of menace, an angry one ; wanton expressions, a sportive look ; <lb/>
            and serious matter, an austere one. For nature forms us first <lb/>
            within to every modification of circumstances ; she delights or <lb/>
            impels us to anger, or depresses us to the earth and aflliets us <lb/>
            with heavy sorrow: then expresses those emotions of the <lb/>
            mind by the tongue, its interpreter. If the words be dis­ <lb/>
            cordant to the station of the speaker, the Roman knights and <lb/>
            plebeians will raise an immoderate laugh. It will make a <lb/>
            wide difference, whether it be Davus that speaks, or a hero ; <lb/>
            a man well-strieken in years, or a hot young fellow in his <lb/>
            bloom; and a matron of distinction, or an oflicious nurse; a <lb/>
            roaming merchant, or the cultivator of a verdant little farm ; <lb/>
            a Colchian, or an Assyrian; one educated at Thebes, or one <lb/>

            fables as are congruous to themselves. If as a poet you have <lb/>
            to represent the renowned Achilles ; let him be indefatigable, <lb/>
            wrathful, inexorable, courageous, let him deny that laws were <lb/>
            made for him, let him arrogate every tiling to force of arms. <lb/>
            Let Medea be fierce and untractable, Ino an object of pity, <lb/>
            Ixion perfidious, 10 wandering, Orestes in distress.</p>

            such as it set out at the beginning, and be consistent with it­ <lb/>
            self. It is difficult to write with propriety 19 on subjects to <lb/>
            which all writers have a common claim; and you with more <lb/>
            prudence will reduce the Iliad into acts, than if you first in­ <lb/>
            troduce arguments unknown and never treated of before. A <lb/>
            public story will become your own property,20 if you do not <lb/>
            dwell upon the whole circle of events, which is paltry and <lb/>
            open to every one; nor must you be so faithful a translator, as <lb/>
            to take the pains of rendering [the original] word for word; <lb/>
            nor by imitating throw yourself into straits, whence either <lb/>
            shame or the rules of your work may forbid you to retreat. <note type="footnote"> 18 The rule is. as appears from the reason of the thing, and from Aris­ <lb/>

            ning to the end of the play, as those of Medea, for instance, and Orestes; <lb/>
            or, if any change be necessary, let it be such as may consist with, and be <lb/>
            easily reconciled to, the manners formerly attributed, as is seen in the <lb/>
            case of Electra and Iphigenia. HURD. </note><note type="footnote"> 19 Difficile est propriè communia dicere. Lambin's comment is, " Com­ <lb/>

            tractata: et ita. quæ cuivis exposita sunt et in medio quodammodo posita, <lb/>
            quasi vacua et a nemine occupata." And that this is the true meaning of <lb/>
            communia is evidently fixed by the words ignota indictaque, which are <lb/>
            explanatory of it. HURD. </note><note type="footnote"> 20 Publica, materies is just the reverse of what the poet had before styled <lb/>
            communia : the latter meaning such subjects or characters as, though by <lb/>
            their nature left in common to all, had yet, in fact, not been occupied by <lb/>
            any writer; the former, those which had already been made public by <lb/>
            occupation. In order to acquire a property in subjects of this sort, the <lb/>
            poet directs us to observe the three following cautions: 1. Not to follow <lb/>
            the trite, obvious round of the original work ; i. c. not servilely and <lb/>
            scrupulously to adhere to its plan or method. 2. Not to be translators, <lb/>
            instead of imitators; i. e. if it shall be thought fit to imitate more ex­ <lb/>
            pressly any part of the original, to do it with freedom and spirit, and <lb/>
            without a slavish attachment to the mode of expression. 3. Not to adopt <lb/>
            any particular incident that may occur in the proposed model, which <lb/>

            marvellous with beauty, [such as] Antiphates, Seylla, the <lb/>
            Cyclops, and Charybdis. Nor does he date Diomede's return <lb/>
            from Meleager's death, nor trace the rise of the Trojan war <lb/>
            from [Leda's] eggs: he always hastens on to the event: and <lb/>

            this,] our inclinations being changed, the age and spirit of <lb/>
            manhood seeks after wealth, and [high] connexions, is sub­ <lb/>
            servient to points of honour; and is cautious of committing <lb/>
            any action, which he would subsequently be industrious to <lb/>
            correct. Many inconveniences encompass a man in years; <lb/>
            either because lie seeks [eagerly] for gain,22 and abstains from <lb/>
            what he has gotten, and is afraid to make use of it: or be­ <lb/>
            cause he transacts every thing in a timorous and dispassionate <lb/>
            manner, dilatory, slow in hope, remiss, and greedy of futurity. <lb/>
            Peevish, querulous, a panegyrist of former times when he was <lb/>
            a boy, a chastiser and censurer of his juniors. Our advancing <lb/>
            years23 bring many advantages along with them. Many our <lb/>
            declining ones take away. That the parts [therefore] belong­ <lb/>
            ing to age may not be given to a youth, and those of a man <lb/>
            to a boy, we must dwell upon those qualities which are joined <lb/>
            and adapted to each person's age.24</p>
          <p>An action is either represented on the stage, or being done <lb/>
            elsewhere is there related. The things which enter by the <lb/>
            ear affect the mind more languidly, than such as are sub­ <lb/>
            mitted to the faithful eyes, and what a spectator presents to <lb/>
            himself. You must not, however, bring upon the stage <lb/>
            things fit only to be acted behind the scenes: and you must <lb/>
            take away from view many actions, which elegant descrip­ <lb/>
            tion25 may soon after deliver in presence [of the spectators]. <lb/>

            the audience, but had a part in the play, and concurred with the other <lb/>

            those of whom the chorus was composed ; " officiumque virile defendat." <lb/>
            The chorus filled up the intervals of the acts with their songs, which were <lb/>
            composed of reflections upon what was past, or their apprehensions of <lb/>
            what might happen. FRAN. </note><note type="footnote"> 28 Officiumque virile. Heinsius takes virile adverbially, for viriliter. <lb/>
            But this is thought harsh. What hinders, but that it may be taken ad­ <lb/>
            jectively ? And then, agreeably to his interpretation, " officium virile " <lb/>
            will mean a strenuous, diligent office, such as becomes a person interested <lb/>
            in the progress of the action. The precept is levelled against the practice <lb/>
            of those poets who, though they allow the part of a persona dramatis to <lb/>
            the chorus, yet for the most part make it so idle and insignificant a one, <lb/>
            a,, is of little consequence in the representation ; by which means the <lb/>
            advantage of probability, intended to be drawn from this use of the <lb/>
            chorus is, in great measure, forfeited. HURD. </note><note type="footnote"> 29 The chorus, says the poet, is to take the side of the good and virtu­ <lb/>
            ous ; i. e. (see note on v. 193), is always to sustain a moral character. <lb/>
            But this will need some explanation and restriction. To conceive aright <lb/>
            of its office, we must suppose the chorus to be a number of persons, by <lb/>
            some probable cause assembled together, as witnesses and spectators of <lb/>
            the great action of the drama. Such persons, as they cannot be wholly <lb/>
            uninterested in what passes before them, will very naturally bear some <lb/>
            share in the representation. This will principally consist in declaring <lb/>
            their sentiments, and indulging their reflections freely on the several <lb/>
            events and distresses as they shall arise. Thus we see the moral at­ <lb/>
            tributed to the chorus, will be no other than the dictates of plain sense; <lb/>
            such as must be obvious to every thinking observer of the action, who is <lb/>
            under the influence of no peculiar partialities from affection or interest. <lb/>
            Though even these may be supposed, in cases where the character to­ <lb/>

            one of those many passages in the epistle bout which the critics have <lb/>
            said a great deal, without explaining any thing. In support of what I <lb/>
            mean to offer, as the true interpretation, I observe, </note><note type="footnote"> I. That the poet's intention certainly was, not to censure the false re­ <lb/>
            finements of their stage music; but, in a short digressive history, (such <lb/>
            as the didactic form will sometimes require,) to describe the rise and <lb/>
            progress of the true. This I collect, 1. From the expression itself, which <lb/>
            cannot, without violence, be understood in any other way. For, as to the <lb/>
            words licentia and prœceps, which have occasioned much of the difficulty, <lb/>
            the first means a freer use, not a licentiousness properly so called ; and <lb/>
            the other only expresses a vehemence and rapidity of language, naturally <lb/>
            productive of a quicker elocution, such as must of course attend the <lb/>
            more numerous harmony of the lyre: not, as M. Dacier translates it, <lb/>
            " une eloquence temeraire et outrée," an extravagant straining and affect­ <lb/>
            ation of style. 2. From the reason of the thing, which makes it incredi­ <lb/>
            ble that the music of the theatre should then be most complete, when the <lb/>
            times were barbarous, and entertainments of this kind little encouraged <lb/>
            or understood. 3. From the character of that music itself; for the rude­ <lb/>
            ness of which, Horace, in effect, apologizes, in defending it only on the <lb/>
            score of the imperfect state of the stage, and the simplicity of its judges. <lb/>
            This then being clear, I observe, </note><note type="footnote"> II. That those two verses, <lb/>
            " Indoctus quid enim saperet liberque laborum, <lb/>
            Rusticus urbano confusus, turpis honesto ?" <lb/>
            are, as they now stand, utterly inexplicable. This hath appeared long <lb/>
            since, from the fruitless labours of the critics, and, above all, of Lambin, <lb/>
            one of the best of them, who, after several repeated efforts to elucidate <lb/>
            this place, leaves it just as dark and unintelligible as he found it. The <lb/>
            interpretation, without them, stands thus: " The tibia," says the poet, <lb/>
            " was at first low and simple. The first, as best agreeing to the then <lb/>
            state of the stage, which required only a soft music to go along with and <lb/>
            assist the chorus, there being no large and crowded theatres to till in</note> <lb/>
             <pb n="311"/>
            the trumpet, but) slender and of simple form, with few stops, <lb/>
            was of service to accompany and assist the chorus, and with <lb/>
            its tone was sufficient to till the rows that were not as yet too <lb/>
            crowded, where an audience, easily numbered, as being small <lb/>
            and sober, chaste and modest, met together. But when the <lb/>
            victorious Romans began to extend their territories, and an <lb/>
            ampler wall encompassed the city, and their genius was in­ <lb/>
            dulged on festivals by drinking wine in the day-time without <lb/>
            censure; a greater freedom arose both to the numbers [of <lb/>
            poetry], and the measure [of music].33 For what taste could <lb/>
            an unlettered clown and one just dismissed from labours have, <note type="footnote"> those days. And the latter, as suiting best to the then state of the times, <lb/>
            whose simplicity and frugal manners exacted the severest temperance, as <lb/>
            in every thing else, so in their dramatic ornaments and decorations. Hut, <lb/>
            when conquest had enlarged the territory and widened the walls of Rome, <lb/>
            and, in consequence thereof, a social spirit had dispelled that severity of <lb/>
            manners, by the introduction of frequent festival solemnities, then, as <lb/>
            was natural to expect, a freer and more varied harmony took place. And <lb/>
            thus it was, that the tibicen. the musician who played to the declamation <lb/>
            in the acts, instead of the rude and simpler strain of the old times, gave <lb/>
            a richness and variety of tone; and instead of the old inactive posture, <lb/>
            added the grace of motion to his art. Just in the same manner," con­ <lb/>
            tinues he, " it happened to the lyre, i. c. the music in the chorus, which <lb/>
            originally, as that of the tibia, was severe and simple; but, by degrees, <lb/>
            acquired a quicker and more expressive modulation, such as corresponded <lb/>
            to the more elevated and passionate turn of the poet's style, and the di­ <lb/>
            viner enthusiasm of his sentiment." HURD. </note><note type="footnote"> 33 Accessit numerisque modisque licentia major. M. Dacier is out again, <lb/>
            when he takes licentia major in a bad sense, as implying " laseiveté, a <lb/>
            culpable and licentious refinement. The licence here spoken of, with re­ <lb/>
            regard to numbers and sounds, like that in another place, which respects <lb/>
            words, (l. 51,) is one of those which is allowed, when sumpta pudenter. <lb/>
            The comparative major, which is a palliative, shows this; and is further <lb/>
            justified by a like passage in Cicero de Oratore, (l. iii. c. 48) where, <lb/>
            speaking of this very licence in poetry, he observes, that out of the heroic <lb/>
            and iambic measure, which was at first strictly observed, there arose by <lb/>
            degrees the anapæst, " procerior quidam numerns, et ille licentior et di­ <lb/>
            vitior dithyrambus ; " evidently not condemning this change, but oppos­ <lb/>
            ing it to the rigorous and confined measures of the elder poet. But the <lb/>
            expression itself occurs in the piece entitled “Orator,” in which, com­ <lb/>
            paring the freedoms of the poetical and oratorical style, " in câ," (i. e. <lb/>
            poeticâ,) says he, " licentiam statuo majorem esSe, quam in nobis facien­ <lb/>
            dorum jungendorumque verborum." The poet says this licence extended <lb/>
            “numeris modisque," the former of which words will express that <lb/>
            licence of metre spoken of by Cicero, and which is further explained, <lb/>
            v. 256, &amp;c., where an account is given of the improvement of the <unclear>iamb</unclear> <lb/>

            when in company with the polite; the base, with the man ot <lb/>
            honour ? Thus the musician added34 new movements and a <note type="footnote"> 34 Sic priscœ—arti tibicen, &amp;c.—Sic fidibus etiam, &amp;c. This is the ap­ <lb/>
            plication of what hath been said, in general, concerning the refinement <lb/>
            of theatrical music to the case of tragedy. Some commentators say, and <lb/>
            to comedy. But in this they mistake, as will appear presently. M. Da­ <lb/>
            cier hath I know not what conceit about a comparison betwixt the Roman <lb/>
            and Greek stage. His reason is, that the lyre was used in the Greek <lb/>
            chorus, as appears, he says, from Sophocles playing upon this instrument <lb/>
            himself in one of his tragedies. And was it not used too in the Roman <lb/>
            chorus, as appears from Nero's playing upon it in several tragedies ? But <lb/>
            the learned critic did not apprehend this matter. Indeed, from the cau­ <lb/>
            tion with which his guides, the dealers in antiquities, always touch this <lb/>
            point, it should seem that they too had no very clear conceptions of it. <lb/>
            The case I take to have been this: the tibia, as being most proper to <lb/>
            accompany the declamation of the acts, cantanti succinere, was constantly <lb/>
            employed, as well in the Roman tragedy as comedy. This appears from <lb/>
            many authorities. I mention only two from Cicero. " Quam multa (Acad. <lb/>
            1. ii. 7.) quæ nos fugiunt in cantu, exaudiunt in eo genere exercitati: Qui, <lb/>
            prime inflatu tibicinis, Antiopam esse aiunt aut Audromachem, cùm nos <lb/>
            ne suspicemur quidem." The other is still more express. In his piece <lb/>
            entitled " Orator," speaking of the negligence of the Roman writers in <lb/>
            respect of numbers, he observes, that there were even many passages in <lb/>
            their tragedies, which, unless the tibia played to them, could not be dis­ <lb/>
            tinguished from mere prose: "quæ nisi cùm tibicen accesserit, orationi <lb/>
            sint solutæ simillima." One of these passages is expressly quoted from <lb/>
            Thyestes, a tragedy of Ennius, and, as appears from the measure, taken <lb/>
            out of one of the acts. It is clear, then, that the tibia was certainly used <lb/>
            in the declamation of tragedy. But now the song of the tragic chorus, <lb/>
            being of the nature of the ode, of course required fides, the lyre, the <lb/>
            peculiar and appropriated instrument of the lyric muse. And this is <lb/>
            clearly collected, if not from express testimonies, yet from some occasional <lb/>
            hints dropped by the ancients. For, 1. the lyre, we are told, (Cic. de <lb/>
            Leg. ii. 9 and 15,) and is agreed on all hands, was an instrument of the <lb/>
            Roman theatre; but it was not employed in comedy. This we certainly <lb/>
            know from the short accounts of the music prefixed to Terence's plays. <lb/>
            2. Further, the tibicen, as we saw, accompanied the declamation of the <lb/>
            acts in tragedy. It remains, then, that the proper place of the lyre was, <lb/>
            where one should naturally look for it, in the songs of the chorus; but <lb/>
            we need not go further than this very passage for a proof. It is un­ <lb/>
            questionable, that the poet is here speaking of the chorus only, the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing lines not admitting any other possible interpretation. By fidibus, <lb/>
            then, is necessarily understood the instrument peculiarly used in it. In <lb/>
            this view, the whole digression is more pertinent and connects better. <lb/>
            The poet had before been speaking of tragedy. All his directions, from <lb/>
            1. 100, respect this species of the drama only. The application of what <lb/>
            he had said concerning music is then most naturally made, 1. to the <lb/>
            tibia, the music of the acts ; and, 2. to fides, that of the choir : thus con­ <lb/>
            lining himself, as the tenor of this part required, to tragedy only. Hence <lb/>
            is seen the mistake, not only of M. Dacicr, whose comment is in every </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="313"/>
            luxuriance to the ancient art, and strutting backward and for­ <lb/>
            ward, drew a length of train over the stage : thus likewise <lb/>
            new notes were added to the severity of the lyre, and precipi­ <lb/>
            tate eloquence produced an unusual language [in the theatre]: <lb/>
            and the sentiments [of the chorus, then] expert in teaching <lb/>
            useful things and prescient of futurity, differ hardly from the <lb/>
            oracular Delphi.35</p>
          <p>The poet, who first tried his skill in tragic verse for the <lb/>
            paltry [prize of a] goat, soon after exposed to view wild <lb/>
            satyrs naked,36 and attempted raillery with severity, still pre­ <lb/>
            serving the gravity [ of tragedy] : because the spectator on <lb/>
            festivals, when heated with wine37 and disorderly, was to be <note type="footnote"> view insupportable ; but, as was hinted, of Heinsius, Lambin, and others, <lb/>
            who, with more probability, explained this of the Roman tragedy and <lb/>
            comedy. For, though tibia might be allowed to stand for comedy, as <lb/>
            opposed to tragœdia, (as, in fact, we find it in II. Ep. l. 98,) that being <lb/>
            the only instrument employed in it; yet, in speaking expressly of the <lb/>
            music of the stage, fides could not determinately enough, and in contra­ <lb/>
            distinction to tibia, denote that of tragedy, it being an instrument used <lb/>
            solely or principally in the chorus, of which, the context shows, he alone <lb/>
            speaks. It is further to be observed, that in the application here made, <lb/>
            besides the music, the poet takes in the other improvements of the tragic <lb/>

            breviter ostendit." (Ad Herenn. Rhet. l. iv.) These aphorisms are heic <lb/>
            mentioned, as constituting the peculiar praise and beauty of the chorus. <lb/>
            This is finely observed, and was intended to convey an oblique censure <lb/>
            on the practice of those poets, who stuff out every part of the drama alike <lb/>
            with moral sentences, not considering that the only proper receptacle of <lb/>
            them is the chorus, where indeed they have an extreme propriety, it <lb/>

            The only piece of this kind remaining to us is the Cyclops of Euripides, <lb/>
            in which Ulysses is the principal actor. The Romans, in imitation of the <lb/>

            were, I observed, certainly misplaced. They should, I think, come in <lb/>
            here, where their sense is extremely pertinent. The poet had been <lb/>

            it will be expedient so to recommend the bantering, so the <lb/>

            But why, it might be asked, this compliance, in so false a taste, with a <lb/>
            drunken, lawless rabble ? The answer is natural, and to the purpose. <lb/>
            " Because their theatres necessarily consisted of a mixed assembly, every <lb/>

            The rusticus and turpis demanded the satyric piece. It was the necessary <lb/>
            result of this mixture ; as, to gratify the better sort, the urbanus and ho­ <lb/>
            nestus, the tragic drama was exhibited. It is some prejudice in favour of <lb/>
            this conjecture, that it explains to us, what would otherwise appear very <lb/>
            strange, that such gross ribaldry, as we know the Atellanes consisted of, <lb/>

            the multitude, as well as of those, quitibus est equus et pater et res. HURD. </note><note type="footnote"> 38 This proves that the same actor, as M. Daeier observes, who had been <lb/>

            " this town, during this play, shall be Epidamnum, and when it has been <lb/>

            this passage ; " our vices oblige us to play many characters, for every vice <lb/>

            known subject. The reasons are, in general, the same for both. Only <lb/>
            one seems peculiar to the Satyrs. For, the cast of them being necessarily <lb/>

              difficulty here in settling a very plain point. The question is, whether <lb/>
              prætextas means tragedy or a species of comedy. The answer is very <lb/>
              clear from Diomedes, whose account is, in short, this : " Togatæis a ge­ <lb/>
              neral term for all sorts of Latin plays adopting the Roman customs and <lb/>
              dresses ; as Palliatæ is for all adopting the Grecian. Of the Togatæ:, the <lb/>
              several species arc, l. Prætexta or pratextata, in which the Roman kings <lb/>
              or generals were introduced, and is so called because the pratexta was <lb/>
              the distinguishing habit of such persons. '2. Tabernwria, frequently called <lb/>
              Togata, though that word, as we have seen, had properly a larger sense. <lb/>
              3. Atellana. 1. Planipedis." He next marks the difference of these <lb/>
              several sorts of the Togatæfrom the similar, corresponding ones of the <lb/>
              Palliatæ, which are these : 1. "Tragœdia, absolutely so styled. 2. Co­ <lb/>
              moedia. 3. Satyri. 4. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μι̃μος</foreign>.” (These four sorts of the Palliatæ were <lb/>
              also probably in use at Rome; certainly, at least, the two former.) It <lb/>
              appears then from thence, that prætextata was properly the Roman tra­ <lb/>
              gedy. But he adds, " Togata prætextata à tragœdia differt " and it is <lb/>
              also said “ to be only like tragedy, tragœdiæ similis.” What is this diner­ <lb/>
              ence-and this likeness? The explanation follows. "Heroes are intro­ <lb/>
              duced in tragedy, such as Orestes, Chryses, and the like. In the præ­ <lb/>
              textata, Brutus, Deems, or Marcellus. ” So then we see when Graecian <lb/>

            ever so perfect in the manners, sentiments, and style, it will not so well <lb/>
            answer the end and purpose of tragedy, as if defective in these, and <lb/>
            finished only in the fable and composition." M. Dacier thinks to clear <lb/>
            this matter by saying, " that what Aristotle remarks holds true of tragedy, <lb/>
            but not of comedy, of which alone Horace is here speaking." But grant­ <lb/>
            ing that the artificial contexture of the fable is less necessary to the per­ <lb/>
            fection of comedy than of tragedy, yet, the tenor of this whole division, <lb/>
            exhorting to correctness in general, makes it unquestionable, that Horace <lb/>
            must intend to include both. The case, as it seems to me, is this. The <lb/>
            poet is not comparing the respective importance of the fable and manners, <lb/>
            but of the manners and diction, under this word including also numbers. <lb/>
            He gives them the preference not to a good plot, nor <unclear/> to fine senti­ <lb/>
            ments, but to versus inopes rerum nuqæque canorae. The art he speaks of, <lb/>
            is the art of expressing the thoughts properly, gracefully, and harmoniously: <lb/>
            the pondus is the force and energy of good versification, Venu is a ge­ <lb/>

          <p>Orpheus, the priest and interpreter of the gods, deterred <lb/>
            the savage race of men from slaughters and inhuman diet; <lb/>
            hence said to tame tigers and furious lions: Amphion too, the <lb/>
            builder of the Theban wall, was said to give the stones mo­ <lb/>
            tion with the sound of his lyre, and to lead them whither­ <lb/>
            soever he would, by engaging persuasion. This was deemed <lb/>
            wisdom of yore, to distinguish the public from private weal; <lb/>
            things sacred from things profane; to prohibit a promiscuous <lb/>
            commerce between the sexes; to give laws to married people: <lb/>
            to plan out cities; to engrave laws on [tables of] wood. <lb/>
            Thus honour accrued to divine poets, and their songs. After <lb/>
            these, excellent Homer and Tyrtæus animated the manly mind <lb/>
            to martial achievements with their verses. Oracles were de­ <lb/>
            livered in poetry, and the economy of life pointed out, and <lb/>
            the favour of sovereign princes was solicited by Pierian56 <note type="footnote"> 55 Invitâ—Minervâ. Cicero, de Off. i. 31, explains this phrase; "ad­ <lb/>
            versante et repugnante naturâ.” And yet the meaning here is not very <lb/>
            evident. Does Horaee say that young Piso will neither do nor say any <lb/>
            thing contrary to his natural endowments; implying that he will not <lb/>
            attempt poetry, as his abilities are inadequate ? Or does he mean to com­ <lb/>

            will attempt, in which genius will not favour and assist him ? The latter <lb/>
            appears to be the correct interpretation. Thus the obvious meaning of <lb/>
            invitâ Minervâ is—Minerva refusing her assistance, or discountenaneing <lb/>
            the attempt : and the interpretation—natural endowments refusing their <lb/>
            assistance, or marring the effort. </note><note type="footnote"> 56 i. e. strains of the muses, surnamed Pierides. </note> <lb/>

          <p>It has been made a question, whether good poetry be de­ <lb/>
            rived from nature or from art. For my part, I can neither <lb/>
            conceive what study can do without a rich [natural] vein, <lb/>
            nor what rude genius can avail of itself: so much does the <lb/>
            one require the assistance of the other, and so amicably do <lb/>
            they conspire [to produce the same effect]. He who is in­ <lb/>
            dustrious to reach the wished-for goal, has done and suffered <lb/>
            much when a boy ; he has sweated and shivered with cold ; <lb/>
            he has abstained from love and wine; he who sings the <lb/>
            Pythian strains,57 was first a learner, and in awe of a master. <lb/>
            But [in poetry] it is now enough for a man to say of him­ <lb/>
            self; "I make admirable verses: a murrain seize the hind­ <lb/>
            most : it is scandalous for me to be outstripped, and fairly to <lb/>
            acknowledge that I am ignorant of that which I never learned."</p>
          <p>As a crier who collects the crowd together to buy his <lb/>
            goods, so a poet rich in land, rich in money put out at inter­ <lb/>

            with his wealth he can distinguish a true friend from a false <lb/>
