            <title type="main">PREFACE BY THE TRANSLATOR.</title>
          </head>
          <p>WHILE the poetical versions of Juvenal deservedly hold a very <lb/>
            high place in the literature of this country, it is a curious fact that <lb/>
            there exists no single prose translation which can stand the test of even <lb/>
            ordinary criticism. Whether it be that the temptation to a metrical <lb/>
            version of a poetical writer is too great with some, or whether the <lb/>
            labour of faithfully representing the genius of confessedly the most <lb/>
            difficult writer in the Latin language has deterred others, the fact <lb/>
            is undeniable, that there is no prose version from which the un­ <lb/>
            classical reader can form any adequate idea of the writings of the <lb/>
            greatest of Satirists.</p>
          <p>Madan, though faithful, is utterly unintelligible to any one who <lb/>
            has not the Latin before him. Sheridan is far too free, in every <lb/>
            sense of the word, to be either a fair expositor of his original, or to <lb/>
            suit the taste of the present day; and without any disparagement of <lb/>
            the labours of Sterling, Nuttall, Smart, or Wallace, it was found <lb/>
            impossible to adopt any one of them even as the basis of a version <lb/>
            which should be worthy of a place in the present series.</p>
          <p>The accompanying translation, therefore, is entirely original; and <lb/>
            the translator is not aware of having copied a single line from any <lb/>
            previous version. How far he has succeeded in giving a faithful <lb/>
            transcript of the author, and in, at the same time, infusing some <lb/>
            spark of the fire and spirit of the original, must be for others to de­ <lb/>
            termine ; all that he dares venture to assert is, that he has brought <lb/>
            to the task an enthusiastic admiration of his author, and a careful <lb/>
            study of many years. The same remarks apply to the translation <lb/>
            of Persius.</p>
          <p>The notes are to a considerable extent original, and the English, <lb/>
            perhaps even the classical, reader may not be displeased at the oc­ <lb/>
            casional introduction of passages from metrical versions in which <lb/>
            the sense appeared to be the most forcibly given.</p>
          <p>A Chronological Table has been added, which the labours of <lb/>
            Mr. Clinton have enabled the Translator to present in a far more <lb/>
            correct form than heretofore.</p><pb n="IV"/>
            
          <p>The poetical version by Gifford has been annexed, as having the <lb/>
            greatest hold on the public favour, and as being perhaps the best, <lb/>
            because the most equal; though, unquestionably, in all the Satires <lb/>
            which Dryden translated, he has immeasurably surpassed Gifford <lb/>
            in fire and spirit; as Hodgson has in elegance and poetic genius, <lb/>
            and Badham in taste, scholarship, and terse and vigorous rendering. <lb/>
            But Gifford is always equal, and generally faithful.</p>
          <p>The remains of Sulpicia and Lucilins appear now for the first <lb/>
            time in English. Of the value of the latter, and of the propriety <lb/>
            of appending his Fragments to a translation of the great Roman <lb/>
            Satirists, no scholar-like reader of Juvenal and Horace can entertain <lb/>
            a doubt. The recent labours of foreign scholars have presented us <lb/>
            with the text in a purer form than almost any collection of Frag­ <lb/>
            ments of the older Latin writers. In the Arguments prefixed to <lb/>
            the several Books, and in the notes, will be found the essence of the <lb/>
            criticisms of Jan. Dousa, Van Heusde, Corpet, Schoenbeck, Schmidt, <lb/>
            ' Petermann, and especially of Gerlach, whose readings have in ge­ <lb/>
            neral been preferred.</p>

            <title type="sub">BY WILLIAM GIFFORD, ESQ.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>DECIMUS JUNIUS JUVENALIS, 1 the author of the following <lb/>
            Satires, was born at Aquinum, an inconsiderable town of the <lb/>
            Volsci, about the year of Christ 38.2 He was either the son, <note type="footnote"> 1 " Junius Juvenalis liberti locupletis incertum filius an alumnus, ad <lb/>
            mediam ætatem declamavit, animi magis causa, quam quod scholæ aut foro <lb/>
            se præpararet." The learned reader knows that this is taken from the brief <lb/>
            account of Juvenal, commonly attributed to Suetonius; but which is pro­ <lb/>
            bably posterior to his time; as it bears very few marks of being written <lb/>
            by a contemporary author : it is, however, the earliest extant. The old <lb/>
            critics, struck with its deficiencies, have attempted to render it more com­ <lb/>
            plete by variations, which take from its authenticity, without adding to its <lb/>
            probability. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 I have adopted Dodwell's chronology. " Sic autem (he says) se rem <lb/>
            illam totam habuisse censeo. Exul erat Juv. cum Satiram scriberet xv. <lb/>
            Hoc confirmat etiam in v. 27, scholiastes. ' De se Juv. dicit, quia in Æ­ <lb/>
            gypto militem tenuit, et ea promittit se relaturum quae ipse vidit.' " Had <lb/>
            not Dodwell been predisposed to believe this, he would have seen that the <lb/>
            scholium " confirmed " nothing: for Juvenal makes no such promise. <lb/>
            " Proinde rixæ illi ipse adfuit quam describit." So error is built up ! How <lb/>
            does it appear that Juvenal was present at the quarrel which he describes ? <lb/>
            He was in Egypt, we know; he had passed through the Ombite nome, and <lb/>
            he speaks of the face of the country as falling under his own inspection : <lb/>
            but this is all; and he might have heard of the quarrel at Rome, or else­ <lb/>
            where. " Tempus autem ipse designavit rixæ illius cum et' nuper'* illam <lb/>
            contigisse dicit, et quidem ' Consule Junio.' Jun. duplicem habent fasti, <lb/>
            alium Domit. in x. Consulatu collegam App. Junium Sabinum A. D. lxxxiv.; <lb/>
            alium Hadriani in suo itidem consulate 111. collegam Q. Junium Rusticum. <lb/>
            Quo minus prior intelligi possit, obstant illa omnia quæ in his ipsis Satiris </note> <note type="footnote"> * This " nuper " is a very convenient word. Here, we see, it signifies lately; but <lb/>
            when it is necessary to bring the works of our author down to a late period, it means, <lb/>
            as Britannicus explains it, " de longo tempore," long ago. </note> <note type="footnote"> a </note> <lb/>

            or the foster-son, of a wealthy freedman, who gave him a liberal <lb/>
            education. From the period of his birth, till he had attained <lb/>
            the age of forty, nothing more is known of him than that <lb/>
            he continued to perfect himself in the study of eloquence, by <lb/>
            declaiming, according to the practice of those days ; yet more <lb/>
            for his own amusement, than from any intention to prepare <lb/>
            himself either for the schools or the courts of law. About <lb/>
            this time he seems to have discovered his true bent, and be­ <lb/>
            taken himself to poetry. Domitian was now at the head of <lb/>
            the government, and showed symptoms of reviving that system <lb/>
            of favouritism which had nearly ruined the empire under <lb/>
            Claudius, by his unbounded partiality for a young pantomime <lb/>
            dancer of the name of Paris. Against this minion, Juvenal <lb/>
            seems to have directed the first shafts of that satire which was <lb/>
            destined to make the most powerful vices tremble, and shake <lb/>
            . the masters of the world on their thrones. He composed a <lb/>
            few lines1 on the influence of Paris, with considerable success, <lb/>
            which encouraged him to cultivate this kind of poetry : he had <lb/>
            the prudence, however, not to trust himself to an auditory, in <lb/>
            a reign which swarmed with informers ; and his compositions <note type="footnote"> occurrunt Domitiani temporibus recentiora." Yet, such is the capricious <lb/>
            nature of criticism ! Dodwell's chief argument to prove the late period at <lb/>
            which Juvenal was banished, is a passage confessedly written under Do­ <lb/>
            mitian, and foisted into a satire published, as he himself maintains, many <lb/>
            years after that emperor's death ! " Posteriorem ergo intellexerit oportet. <lb/>
            Hoc ergo anno (cxix.) erat in exilio. Sed vero Roma ilium ejicere non <lb/>
            potuit Trajanus, qui ab anno usque CXII. Romæ ipse non adfuit; nec <lb/>
            etiam ante CXVIII. quo Romam venit imperator Hadrianus. Sic ante anni <lb/>
            CXVIII. finem, aut cxix. initium, mitti vix potuit in exilium Juvenalis : <lb/>
            erat autem cum relegaretur, octogenarius. Proinde natus fuerit vel anni <lb/>
            xxxviii. fine, vel xxxix. initio." Annal. 157—159. </note><note type="footnote"> I have made this copious extract from Dodwell, because it contains a <lb/>
            summary of the chief arguments which induced Pithæus, Henninius, Lip­ <lb/>
            sius, Salmasius, &amp;c. to attribute the banishment of the author to Hadrian. <lb/>
            To me they appear any thing but conclusive ; for, to omit other objec­ <lb/>
            tions for the present, why may not the Junius of the fifteenth Satire be <lb/>
            the one who was Consul with Domitian in 84, when Juvenal, by Dod­ <lb/>
            well's own calculation, was in his 47th, instead of his 80th, year. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 " Deinde paucorum versuum satira non absurde composita in Parid­ <lb/>
            em pantomimum, poetamque Claudii Neronis," (the writer seems, in this <lb/>
            and the following clause, to have referred to Juvenal's words; it is, there­ <lb/>
            fore, probable that we should read Calvi Neronis, i. e. Domitian; other­ <lb/>
            wise the phrase must be given up as an absurd interpolation,) " ejus se­ <lb/>
            mestribus militiolis tumentem : genus scripturæ industriose excoluit. <lb/>
            Suet. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="III"/>
            were, therefore, secretly handed about amongst his friends. 1 <lb/>
            By degrees he grew bolder; and, having made many large <lb/>
            additions to his first sketch, or perhaps re-cast it, produced <lb/>
            what is now called his Seventh Satire, which he recited to a <lb/>
            numerous assemblage. The consequences were such as he <lb/>
            had probably anticipated: Paris, informed of the part which <lb/>
            he bore in it, was seriously offended, and complained to the <note type="footnote"> 1 " Et tamen diu, ne medico quidem auditorio quicquam committere <lb/>
            ausus est." Suet. On this Dodwell observes: " Tarn longe aberant illa <lb/>
            a Paridis ira concitanda, si vel superstite Paride fuissent scripta, eum irri­ <lb/>
            tare non possent, cum nondum emanassent in publicum," 161. He then <lb/>
            adds that " Martial knew nothing of his poetical studies,* who boasted <lb/>
            that he was as familiar with Juvenal as Pylades with Orestes ! " It ap­ <lb/>
            pears, indeed, that they were acquainted ; but I suspect, notwithstanding <lb/>
            the vehemence of Martial's assertions, that there was no great cordiality <lb/>
            between minds so very dissimilar. Some one, it seems, had accused the <lb/>
            epigrammatist to the satirist, not improbably, of making too free with his <lb/>
            thoughts and expressions. He was seriously offended ; and Martial, in­ <lb/>
            stead of justifying himself, (whatever the charge might be,) imprecates <lb/>
            shame on his accuser in a strain of idle rant not much above the level of <lb/>
            a schoolboy. Lib. vii. 24. </note><note type="footnote"> But if he had been acquainted with his friend's poetry, he would cer­ <lb/>
            tainly have spoken of it. Not quite so certainly. These learned critics <lb/>
            seem to think that Juvenal, like the poets he ridicules, wrote nothing but <lb/>
            trite fooleries on the Argonauts and the Lapithæ. Were the Satires of <lb/>
            Juvenal to be mentioned with approbation ? and, if they were, was Mar-' <lb/>
            tial the person to do it ? Martial, the most devoted sycophant of the age, <lb/>
            who was always begging, and sometimes receiving, favours from the man <lb/>
            whose castigation was, in general, the express object of them. Is it not <lb/>
            more consonant to his character to suppose that he would conceal his <lb/>
            knowledge of them with the most scrupulous care ? </note><note type="footnote"> But when Domitian was dead, and Martial removed from Rome, when, <lb/>
            in short, there was no danger of speaking out, he still appears, continue <lb/>
            they, to be ignorant of his friend's poetic talents. I am almost ashamed <lb/>
            to repeat what the critics so constantly forget-that Juvenal was not only </note> <note type="footnote"> * But how is this ascertained ? Very easily ; he calls him " facundus Juvenalis." <lb/>
            Here the question is finally left; for none of the commentators suppose it possible <lb/>
            that the epithet can be applied to any but a rhetorician. Yet it is applied by the same <lb/>
            writer to a poet of no ordinary kind ; <lb/>
            " Accipe, facundi Culicem, studiose. Maronis <lb/>
            Ne, nugis positis, arma virumque canas." <lb/>
            Lib. xiv. 185. <lb/>
            And, by the author himself, to one who had grown old in the art: <lb/>
            " — tunc seque suamque <lb/>
            Terpsichoren oditfacunda et nuda senectus." <lb/>
            Let it be remembered, too, that Martial, as is evident from the frequent allusions to <lb/>
            Domitian's expedition against the Catti, wrote this epigram (lib. vii. 91) in the com­ <lb/>
            mencement of that prince's reign, when it is acknowledged that Juvenal had produced <lb/>
            but one or two of his Satires. </note> <note type="footnote"> a 2 </note> <lb/>

            the interpolations of the old grammarians, I shall, as before, have recourse <lb/>
            to Dodwell. " Recitavit, ni fallor, omnia, emisitque in publicum CXVIII. <lb/>

            qua occurrunt verba ilia de Paride commendat." 161. Salmasius sup­ <lb/>
            posed that the last of his Satires only were published under Hadrian; <lb/>
            Dodwell goes further, and maintains that the whole, with the exception <lb/>
            of the 15th and 16th,* (" si tamen vere et ilia Juvenalis fuerit,") were <lb/>
            then first produced ! " Ilia in Paridem dicteria histrionem, in suum (cujus <lb/>
            nomen non prodidit auctor) histrionem dicta interpretabatur Hadrianus. <lb/>

            turned of eighty. Salmasius, more rationally, conceives it to have been produced at <lb/>
            Rome. Giving full credit, however, to the story of his late banishment, he is driven <lb/>
            into a very awkward supposition. " An non alio tempore, atque alia de causa Ægyp­ <lb/>

            ple to attribute his exile at once to Domitian ? </note><note type="footnote"> With respect to the 16th Satire, Dodwell, we see, hesitates to attribute it to Juve­ <lb/>
            nal; and, indeed, the old Scholiast says, that, in his time, many thought it to be the <lb/>
            work of a different hand. So it always appeared to me. It is unworthy of the author's <lb/>
            best days, and seems but little suited to his worst. He was at least eighty-one, they <lb/>
            say, when he wrote it, yet it begins— <lb/>
            " — Nam si <lb/>
            Me pavidum excipiet tyronem porta secundo <lb/>
            Sidere," &amp;c. <lb/>
            Surely, at this age, the writer resembled Priam, the tremulus miles, more than the <lb/>
            timid tyro ! Nor do I believe that Juvenal would have been much inclined to amuse <lb/>
            himself with the fancied advantages of a profession to which he was so unworthily <lb/>
            driven. But the Satire must have been as ill-timed for the army as for himself, since <lb/>
            it was probably, at this period, in a better state of subjection than it had been for many <lb/>
            reigns. I suppose it to be written in professed imitation of our author's manner, <lb/>
            about the age of Commodus. It has considerable merit, though the first and last pa­ <lb/>
            ragraphs are feeble and tautological; and the execution of the whole is much inferior <lb/>
            to the design. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="V"/>
            mand. To remove such a man from his court must undoubt­ <lb/>
            edly have been desirable to Domitian ; and, as he was spoken <note type="footnote"> ' intra brevissimum tempus' perierit." 164. Such is the manner in <lb/>
            which Dodwell accommodates Suetonius to his own ideas : which seem, <lb/>
            also, to have been those of a much higher name, Salmasius; and, while <lb/>
            I am now writing, to be sanctioned by the adoption of the learned Ruper­ <lb/>
            ti. I never affected singularity; yet I find myself constrained to differ <lb/>
            from them all: but I will state my reasons. In his 7th Satire, after <lb/>
            speaking of Quintilian, Juvenal adds, <lb/>
            " Si fortuna volet, ties de rhetore consul: <lb/>
            Si volet haec eadem ties de consule rhetor." <lb/>
            Which, taking it for a proverbial expression, I have loosely rendered, <lb/>
            Fortune can make kings of pedants, and pedants of kings. Dodwell, <lb/>
            however, understands it literally. " Hæc sane cum Quintiliani causa dicat, <lb/>
            vix est quin Q. talem ostendant e rhetore nimirum 'nobilem, senatorium, <lb/>
            consularem,' et quidem illis divitiis instructum, quæ essent etiam ad cen­ <lb/>
            sum senatorium necessariæ." 152. Now, as Pliny, who probably died <lb/>
            before Trajan, observes that Quintilian was a man of moderate fortune, it <lb/>
            follows that he must have acquired the wealth and honours of which Ju­ <lb/>
            venal speaks at a later period. Dodwell fixes this to the time when Ha­ <lb/>
            drian entered Rome, cXVIII.,which lie states to be also that of the author's <lb/>
            banishment. It must be confessed that Juvenal lost no time in exerting <lb/>
            himself: he had remained silent fourscore years ; he now bursts forth at <lb/>
            once, as Dodwell expresses it, recites all his Satires without intermission, <lb/>
            (" unis continuisque recitationibus,") celebrates Quintilian, attacks the <lb/>
            emperor, and is immediately despatched to Egypt! 162. Here is a great <lb/>
            deal of business crowded into the compass of a few weeks, or perhaps <lb/>
            days ;—but let us examine it a little more closely. Rigaltius, with several <lb/>
            of the commentators, sees in the lines above quoted a sneer at Quintilian, <lb/>
            and he accounts for the rhetor's silence respecting our author, by the <lb/>
            resentment which he supposes him to have felt at it. As this militates <lb/>
            strongly against Dodwell's ideas, he will not allow that any thing severe <lb/>
            was intended by the passage in question ; and adds that Quintilian could <lb/>
            not mention Juvenal as a satirist, because he had not then written any <lb/>
            satires. 160. I believe that both are wrong. In speaking of the satirists, <lb/>
            Quintilian says that Persius had justly acquired no inconsiderable degree <lb/>
            of reputation by the little he had written. Lib. x. c. 1. He then adds, <lb/>
            " sunt clari hodieque, et qui olim nominabuntur." There are yet some <lb/>
            excellent ones, some who will be better known hereafter. It always ap­ <lb/>
            peared to me, that this last phrase alluded to our author, with whose ex­ <lb/>
            traordinary merits Quintilian was probably acquainted, but whom he did <lb/>
            not choose, or, perhaps, did not dare to mention in a work composed un­ <lb/>
            der a prince whose crimes this unnamed satirist persecuted with a severity <lb/>
            as unmitigated as it was just. Quintilian had no political courage. <lb/>
            Either from a sense of kindness or fear, he flatters Domitian almost as <lb/>
            grossly as Martial does:—but his life was a life of innocence and inte­ <lb/>
            grity ; I will therefore say no more on this subject; but leave it to the <lb/>
            reader to consider whether such a man was likely to startle the " god of <lb/>
            his idolatry " by celebrating the Satires of Juvenal. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="VI"/>
            of with kindness in the same Satire, which is entirely free from <lb/>
            political allusions, the " facetiousness " of the punishment <note type="footnote"> Nor do I agree with the commentators whom Dodwell has followed, in <lb/>
            the literal interpretation of those famous lines. " Unde igitur tot," &amp;c. <lb/>
            Sat. vii. v. 188—194. Quintilian was rich, when the rest of his profes­ <lb/>
            sion were in the utmost want. Here then was an instance of good fortune. <lb/>
            He was lucky; and with luck a man may be any thing; handsome, and <lb/>
            witty, and wise, and noble, and high-born, and a member of the senate. <lb/>
            Who does not see in this a satirical exaggeration ? Wisdom, beauty, and <lb/>
            high-birth, luck cannot give : why then should the remainder of this pas­ <lb/>
            sage be so strictly interpreted, and referred to the actual history of Quin­ <lb/>
            tilian ? The lines, " Si fortuna volet," &amp;c., are still more lax: a reflection <lb/>
            thrown out at random, and expressing the greatest possible extremes of <lb/>
            fortune. Yet on these authorities principally (for the passage of Auso­ <lb/>
            nius,* written more than two centuries later, is of no great weight) has <lb/>
            Quintilian been advanced to consular honours; while Dodwell, who, as <lb/>
            we have seen, has taken immense pains to prove that they could only be <lb/>
            conferred on him by Hadrian, has hence deduced his strongest arguments <lb/>
            for the late date of our author's Satires; which he thus brings down to <lb/>
            the period of mental imbecility! Hence, too, he accounts for the different <lb/>
            ideas of Quintilian's wealth in Juvenal and Pliny. When the latter wrote, <lb/>
            he thinks Quintilian had not acquired much property, he was " modicus <lb/>
            facultatibus when the former, " he had been enriched by the imperial <lb/>
            bounty, and was capable of senatorial honours." Yet Pliny might not <lb/>
            think his old master rich enough to give a fortune with his daughter ade­ <lb/>
            quate to the expectations of a man of considerable rank, (lib. vi. 32,) <lb/>
            though Juvenal, writing at the same instant, might term him wealthy, in <lb/>
            comparison of the rhetoricians who were starving around him ; and count <lb/>
            him a peculiar favourite of fortune. Let us bear in mind, too, that Juvenal <lb/>
            is a satirist, and a poet: in the latter capacity, the minute accuracy of an <lb/>
            annalist cannot be expected at his hands ; and in the former-as his object </note> <note type="footnote"> * " Q. consularia per Clementem ornamenta sortitus, honestamenta potius videtur <lb/>
            quam insignia potestatis habuisse. In gratiar. act." Quintilian, then, was not actually <lb/>
            consul: but this is no great matter-it is of more consequence to ascertain the demons <lb/>
            by whom he was so honoured. In the preface to his fourth book, he says, " Cum vero <lb/>
            mihi Dom. Augustus sororis suæ nepotum delegavit curam," &amp;c. Vespasian had a <lb/>
            daughter, Domitilla, who married, and died long before her father: she left a daughter, <lb/>
            who was given to Flavius Clemens, by whom she had two sons. These were the grand- <lb/>
            children of Domitian's sister, of whom Quintilian speaks; and to their father, Siemens, <lb/>
            according to Ausonius, he was indebted for the show, though not the reality, of power. <lb/>
            There is nothing incongruous in all this; yet so possessed are Dodwell and his numer­ <lb/>
            ous followers (among whom I am sorry to rank Dusaulx) of the late period at which it <lb/>
            happened, that they will needs have Hadrian to be meant by Domitianus Augustus, <lb/>
            though the detestable flattery which follows the words I have quoted, most indisput­ <lb/>
            ably proves it to be Domitian ; and though Dodwell himself is forced to confess that lie <lb/>
            can find no Clemens under Hadrian to whom the passage applies : " Quis autem fuerit <lb/>
            Clemens ille qui Q. ornamenta illa sub Hadriano impetraverit, me sane fateor igno­ <lb/>
            rare!" 165. Another circumstance which has escaped all the commentators, and which <lb/>
            is of considerable importance in determining the question, remains to be noticed. At <lb/>
            the very period of which Dodwell treats, the boundaries of the empire were politically <lb/>
            contracted, while Juvenal, whenever he has occasion to speak on the subject, invari­ <lb/>
            ably dwells on extending or securing them. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="VII"/>
            (though Domitian's was not a facetious reign) renders the fact <lb/>
            not altogether improbable. Yet, when we consider that these <lb/>
            reflections on Paris could scarcely have been published before <lb/>
            LXXXIV., and that the favourite was disgraced and put to <lb/>
            death almost immediately after, we shall be inclined to doubt <lb/>
            whether his banishment actually took place; or, if it did, <lb/>
            whether it was of any long duration. That Juvenal was in <lb/>
            Egypt is certain ; but he might have gone there from motives <lb/>
            of personal safety, or, as Salmasius has it, of curiosity. How­ <lb/>
            ever this may be, it does not appear that he was ever long <lb/>
            absent from Rome, where a thousand internal marks clearly <lb/>
            show that all his Satires were written. But whatever punish­ <lb/>
            ment might have followed the complaint of Paris, 1 it had no <lb/>
            other effect on our author, than that of increasing his hatred <lb/>
            of tyranny, and turning his indignation upon the emperor <note type="footnote"> was to show the general discouragement of literature, he could not, con­ <lb/>
            sistently with his plan, attribute the solitary good fortune of Quintilian to <lb/>
            any thing but luck. </note><note type="footnote"> But why was Quintilian made consul ? Because, replies Dodwell, (164,) <lb/>
            when Hadrian first entered Rome he was desirous of gaining the affec­ <lb/>
            tions of the people ; which could be done no way so effectually as by con­ <lb/>
            ciliating the esteem of the literati; and he therefore conferred this extra­ <lb/>
            ordinary mark of favour on the rhetorician. How did it escape this learned <lb/>
            man, that he was likely to do himself more injury in their opinion by the <lb/>
            banishment of Juvenal at that same instant ? an old man of fourscore, who, <lb/>
            by his own testimony, had spoken of him with kindness, in a poem which <lb/>
            did more honour to his reign than any thing produced in it! and whose <lb/>
            only crime was an allusion to the influence of a favourite player !-In­ <lb/>
            deed, the informers of Hadrian's reign must have had more sagacious <lb/>
            noses than those of Domitian's, to smell out his fault. What Statius, in <lb/>
            his time, was celebrated for the recitation of a Thebaid, or what Paris, for <lb/>
            the purchase of an untouched Agave ? And where, might we ask Dod­ <lb/>
            well, was the "jest" of sending a man on the verge of the grave, in a <lb/>
            military capacity, into Egypt ? Could the most supple of Hadrian's <lb/>
            courtiers look on it as any thing but a wanton exercise of cruelty ? At <lb/>
            eighty, the business of satirizing, either in prose or verse, is nearly over: <lb/>
            what had the emperor then to fear ? And to sum up all in a word,can <lb/>
            any rational being seriously persuade himself that the Satires of Juvenal <lb/>
            were produced, for the first time, by a man turned of fourscore ? </note><note type="footnote"> 1 But why should he complain at all ? Was he ashamed of being known <lb/>
            to possess an influence at the imperial court? Those were not very mo­ <lb/>
            dest times, nor is modesty, in general, the crying vice of the " quality." <lb/>
            He was more likely to have gloried in it. If Bareas, or Camerinus, or <lb/>
            any of the old nobility, had complained of the author, I should have <lb/>
            thought it more reasonable :-but Domitian cared nearly as little for them <lb/>
            as Paris himself did. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="VIII"/>
            himself, whose hypocrisy, cruelty, and licentiousness, became, <lb/>
            from that period, the object of his keenest reprobation. He <lb/>
            profited, indeed, so far by his danger or his punishment, as to <lb/>
            recite no more in public; but he continued to write during <lb/>
            the remainder of Domitian's reign, in which he finished, as I <lb/>
            conceive, his second, third,1 fifth, sixth,2 apd perhaps thir- <note type="footnote"> I I hold, in opposition to the commentators, that Juvenal was known <lb/>
            in Domitian's time, not only as a poet, but as a keen and vigorous satirist. <lb/>
            He himself, though he did not choose to commit his safety to a promis­ <lb/>
            cuous audience, appears to make no great secret of his peculiar talents. <lb/>
            In this Satire, certainly prior to many of the others, he tells us that he <lb/>
            accompanied Umbritius, then on his way to Cumæ, out of the gates of <lb/>
            Rome. Umbritius predicted, as Tacitus says, the death of Galba, at <lb/>
            which time he was looked upon as the most skilful aruspex of the age. <lb/>
            He could not then be a young man ; yet, at quitting the capital, he still <lb/>
            talks of himself as in the first stage of old age, " nova canities, et prima <lb/>
            et recta senectus." His voluntary exile, therefore, could not possibly <lb/>
            have taken place long after the commencement of Domitian's reign; <lb/>
            when he speaks of Juvenal as already celebrated for his Satires, and <lb/>
            modestly doubts whether the assistance of so able a coadjutor as himself <lb/>
            would be accepted. </note><note type="footnote"> This, at least, serves to prove in what light the author wished to be <lb/>
            considered :-for the rest, there can, I think, exclusively of what I have <lb/>
            urged, be little doubt that this Satire was produced under Domitian. It <lb/>
            is known, from other authorities, that he revived the law of Otho in all <lb/>
            its severity, that he introduced a number of low and vicious characters, <lb/>
            " pinnirapi cultos juvenes, juvcnesque lanistæ," into the Equestrian Or­ <lb/>
            der, that he was immoderately attached to building, &amp;c., circumstances <lb/>
            much dwelt on in this Satire, and applicable to him alone. </note><note type="footnote"> 2The following line, " Dacicus et scripto radiat Germanicus auro," <lb/>
            seems to militate against the early date of this Satire. Catanæus and <lb/>
            Arntzenius say that Juvenal could not mean Domitian here, because <lb/>
            " he did not think well enough of him to do him such honour; whereas <lb/>
            he was fond of commending Trajan." I see no marks of this fondness; <lb/>
            nor were the titles, if meant of Domitian, intended to do him honour, <lb/>
            but to reprove his vanity. </note><note type="footnote"> Whether medals were ever struck with the inscription of Dacicus and <lb/>
            Germanicus in honour of Domitian, I am not qualified to determine. <lb/>
            Certain it is, however, that he assumed both these titles; the latter, in­ <lb/>
            deed, in common with his predecessors from the time of Germ. Cæsar ; <lb/>
            and the former, in consequence of his pretended success in the Dacian <lb/>
            war, for which he is bitterly sneered at by Pliny, as well as Dio. It is <lb/>
            given to him, amongst others, by Martial, who dedicates his eighth book, <lb/>
            " Imper. Domit. Cæs. Augusto Germanico Dacico." Dodwell appropri­ <lb/>
            ates (as I do) the line to Domitian—a little inconsistently, it must be <lb/>
            confessed ; but that is his concern. If, however, it be adjudged to Tra­ <lb/>
            jan, I should not for that bring down the date of the Satire to a later <lb/>
            period. Juvenal revised and enlarged all his works, when he gave them <lb/>
            to the public : this under consideration, in particular, has all the marks </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="IX"/>
            teenth1 Satires ; the eighth2 I have always looked upon as his <lb/>
            first.</p>
          <p>In xcv., when Juvenal was in his 54th year, Domitian ban­ <lb/>
            ished the philosophers from Rome, and soon after from Italy, <note type="footnote"> of having received considerable additions; and one of them might be <lb/>
            the line in question. </note><note type="footnote"> I This Satire has contributed as much perhaps as the seventh to per­ <lb/>
            suade Lipsius, Salmasius, and others, that Juvenal wrote his best pieces <lb/>
            when he was turned of fourscore. <lb/>
            " Stupet hæc, qui jam post terga reliquit <lb/>
            Sexaginta annos, Fonteio Consule natus ! " <lb/>
            There were four consuls of this name. The first is out of the question; <lb/>
            the second was consul A. D. 13, the third in 59, and the fourth in 68. If <lb/>
            we take the second, and add any intermediate number of years between <lb/>
            sixty and seventy, for Calvinus had passed his sixtieth year, it will just <lb/>
            bring us down to the early part of Domitian's reign, which I suppose to <lb/>
            be the true date of this Satire; for I cannot believe, as I have already <lb/>
            observed, that this, or indeed any part of Juvenal's works, was produced <lb/>
            when he was trembling on the verge of ninety, as must be the case if <lb/>
            either of the latter periods be adopted. But he observes, " Hæc quota <lb/>
            pars scelerum quae custos Gallicus urbis," &amp;c. Now Rutilius Gallicus <lb/>
            was præfect of Rome from the end of 85 to 88, (Domitian succeeded his <lb/>
            brother in 81,) in which year he died. There seems to be no necessity <lb/>
            for mentioning a magistrate as sitting, who was not then in existence ; <lb/>
            nor can any reason be assigned, if the Satire was written under Hadrian, <lb/>
            for the author's recurring to the times of Domitian for a name, when that <lb/>
            of the " custos urbis" of the day would have better answered his purpose. <lb/>
            It is probable that Gallicus succeeded Pegasus, who was præfect when <lb/>
            the ridiculous farce of the turbot took place (Sat. iv.); this would fix it <lb/>
            to 85, the year before Fuscus, who was present at it, was sent into Dacia. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This Satire is referred by the critics to the reign of Trajan, because <lb/>
            Marius, whose trial took place under that prince, is mentioned in it. I <lb/>
            have attributed it to an earlier period ; principally moved by the consider­ <lb/>
            ation that it presents a faithful copy of the state of Rome and the con­ <lb/>
            quered provinces under Nero, and which could scarcely have been given <lb/>
            in such vivid colours after the original had ceased to affect the mind. <lb/>
            What Rome was under Domitian, may be seen in the second Satire, and <lb/>
            the difference, which has not been sufficiently attended to, is striking in <lb/>
            the extreme. I would observe too, that Juvenal speaks here of the crimes <lb/>
            of Marius :-they might be, and probably were, committed long before <lb/>
            his condemnation ; but under Domitian it was scarcely safe to attempt <lb/>
            bringing such gigantic peculators to justice. Add to this, that the other <lb/>
            culprits mentioned in it are all of them prior to that prince; nay, one <lb/>
            of them, Capito, was tried so early as the beginning of Nero's reign. <lb/>
            The insertion of Marius, however, (which might be an after-thought,) <lb/>
            forms a main argument with Dodwell for the very late date of this Sa­ <lb/>
            tire ; he observes that it had escaped Lipsius and Salmasius ; and boasts <lb/>
            of it as " longe certissimum," &amp;c. 156. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="X"/>
            with many circumstances of cruelty; an action, for which, <lb/>
            I am sorry to observe, he is covertly praised by Quintilian. <lb/>
            Though Juvenal, strictly speaking, did not come under the <lb/>
            description of a philosopher, yet, like the hare in the fable, he <lb/>
            might not unreasonably entertain some apprehensions for his <lb/>
            safety, and, with many other persons eminent for learning and <lb/>
            virtue, judge it prudent to withdraw from the city. To this <lb/>
            period I have always inclined to fix his journey to Egypt. <lb/>
            Two years afterwards the world was happily relieved from <lb/>
            the tyranny of Domitian; and Nerva, who succeeded him, <lb/>
            recalled the exiles. From this time there remains little doubt <lb/>
            of Juvenal's being at Rome, where he continued his studies <lb/>
            in tranquillity.</p>
          <p>His first Satire after the death of Domitian, seems to have <lb/>
            been what is now called the fourth. About this time, too, he <lb/>
            probably thought of revising and publishing those which he <lb/>
            had already written ; and composed or completed that intro­ <lb/>
            ductory piece,' which now stands at the head of his works. <lb/>
            As the order is every where broken in upon, it is utterly im­ <lb/>
            possible to arrange them chronologically; but I am inclined <lb/>
            to think that the eleventh Satire closed his poetical career. <lb/>
            All else is conjecture; but in this he speaks of himself as an <lb/>
            old man, <lb/>
            " Nostra bibat vernum contracta cuticula solem <lb/>
            and indeed he had now passed his grand climacteric.</p>
          <p>This is all that can be collected of the life of Juvenal; and <lb/>
            how much of this is built upon uncertainties ! I hope, how­ <lb/>
            ever, that it bears the stamp of probability; which is all I <lb/>
            contend for; and which, indeed, if I do not deceive myself, is <lb/>
            somewhat more than can be affirmed of what has been hitherto <lb/>
            delivered on the subject.</p>
          <p>Little is known of Juvenal's circumstances; but, happily, <note type="footnote"> 1 I have often wondered at the stress which Dodwell and others lay <lb/>
            on the concluding lines of this Satire : " Experiar quid concedatur," &amp;c. <lb/>
            They fancy that the engagement was seriously made, and religiously ob­ <lb/>
            served. Nothing was ever further from the mind of Juvenal. It is <lb/>
            merely a poetical, or, if you will, a satirical, flourish ; since there is not <lb/>
            a single Satire, I am well persuaded, in which the names of many, who <lb/>
            were alive at the time, are not introduced. Had Dodwell forgotten <lb/>
            Quintilian ? or, that he had allowed one of his Satires, at least, to be <lb/>
            prior to this ? </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="XI"/>
            that little is authentic, as it comes from himself. He had a <lb/>
            competence. The dignity of poetry is never disgraced in him, <lb/>
            as it is in some of his contemporaries, by fretful complaints of <lb/>
            poverty, or clamorous whinings for meat and clothes :-the <lb/>
            little patrimony which his foster-father left him, he never <lb/>
            diminished, and probably never increased. It seems to have <lb/>
            equalled all his wants, and, as far as appears, all his wishes. <lb/>
            Once only he regrets the narrowness of his fortune ; but the <lb/>
            occasion does him honour ; it is solely because he cannot afford <lb/>
            a more costly sacrifice to express his pious gratitude for the <lb/>
            preservation of his friend: yet " two lambs and a youthful <lb/>
            steer " bespeak the affluence of a philosopher; which is not <lb/>
            belied by the entertainment provided for his friend Persicus, <lb/>
            in that beautiful Satire which is here called the last of his <lb/>
            works. Further it is useless to seek : from pride or modesty, <lb/>
            he has left no other notices of himself; or they have perished. <lb/>
            Horace and Persius, his immediate predecessors, are never <lb/>
            weary of speaking of themselves. The life of the former <lb/>
            might be written, from his own materials, with all the mi­ <lb/>
            nuteness of a contemporary history: and the latter, who <lb/>
            attained to little more than a third of Juvenal's age, has <lb/>
            left nothing to be desired on the only topics which could <lb/>
            interest posterity,-his parent, his preceptor, and his course <lb/>
            of studies.</p>

            <title type="main">AN ESSAY ON THE ROMAN SATIRISTS, BY WILLIAM GIFFORD, ESQ.</title>
          </head>
          <p>IT will now be expected from me, perhaps, to say something <lb/>
            on the nature and design of Satire ; but in truth this has so <lb/>
            frequently been done, that it seems, at present, to have as little <lb/>
            of novelty as of utility to recommend it.</p>
          <p>Dryden, who had diligently studied the French critics, drew <lb/>
            up from their remarks, assisted by a cursory perusal of what <lb/>
            Casaubon, Heinsius, Rigaltius, and Scaliger had written on <lb/>
            the subject, an account of the rise and progress of dramatic <lb/>
            and satiric poetry amongst the Romans ; which he prefixed to <lb/>
            his translation of Juvenal. What Dryden knew, he told in a <lb/>
            manner that renders every attempt to recount it after him <lb/>
            equally hopeless and vain ; but his acquaintance with works <lb/>
            of literature was not very extensive, while his reliance on his <lb/>
            own powers sometimes betrayed him into inaccuracies, to which <lb/>
            the influence of his name gives a dangerous importance.</p>
          <p>" The comparison of Horace with Juvenal and Persius," <lb/>
            which makes a principal part of his Essay, is not formed with <lb/>
            much niceness of discrimination, or accuracy of judgment. <lb/>
            To speak my mind, I do not think that he clearly perceived <lb/>
            or fully understood the characters of the first two :-of Persius <lb/>
            indeed he had an intimate knowledge ; for, though he certain­ <lb/>
            ly deemed too humbly of his poetry, he yet speaks of his beau­ <lb/>
            ties and defects in a manner which evinces a more than com­ <lb/>
            mon acquaintance with both.</p>
          <p>What Dryden left imperfect has been filled up in a great <lb/>
            measure by Dusaulx, in the preliminary discourse to his trans­ <lb/>
            lation of Juvenal, and by Ruperti, in his critical Essay " De <lb/>
            diversa Satirarum Lucil. Herat. Pers. et Juvenalis indole."</p><pb n="XIII"/>
            
          <p>With the assistance of the former of these I shall endeavour <lb/>
            to give a more extended view of the characteristic excellencies <lb/>
            and defects of the rival Satirists than has yet appeared in our <lb/>
            language; little solicitous for the praise of originality, if I <lb/>
            may be allowed to aspire to that of candour and truth. Pre­ <lb/>
            viously to this, however, it will be necessary to say something <lb/>
            on the supposed origin of Satire: and, as this is a very beaten <lb/>
            subject, I shall discuss it as briefly as possible.</p>
          <p>It is probable that the first metrical compositions of the Ro­ <lb/>
            mans, like those of every other people, were pious effusions <lb/>
            for favours received or expected from the gods : of these, the <lb/>
            earliest, according to Varro, were the hymns to Mars, which, <lb/>
            though used by the Salii in the Augustan age, were no longer <lb/>
            intelligible., To these succeeded the Fescennine verses, which <lb/>
            were sung, or rather recited, after the vintage and harvest, <lb/>
            and appear to have been little more than rude praises of the <lb/>
            tutelar'divinities of the country, intermixed with clownish <lb/>
            jeers and sarcasms, extemporally poured out by the rustics in <lb/>
            some kind of measure, and indifferently directed at the audi­ <lb/>
            ence, or at one another. These, by degrees, assumed the form <lb/>
            of a dialogue; of which, as nature is every where the same, <lb/>
            and the progress of refinement but little varied, some resem­ <lb/>
            blance may perhaps be found in the grosser eclogues of Theo­ <lb/>
            critus.</p>
          <p>Thus improved, (if the word may be allowed of such bar­ <lb/>
            barous amusements,) they formed, for near three centuries, the <lb/>
            delight of that nation : popular favour, however, had a dan­ <lb/>
            gerous effect on the performers, whose licentiousness dege­ <lb/>
            nerated at length into such wild invective, that it was found <lb/>
            necessary to restrain it by a positive law: " Si qui populo <lb/>
            occentassit, carmenve condisit, quod infamiam faxit ftagitium­ <lb/>
            ve alteri, fuste ferito." From this time we hear no further <lb/>
            complaints of the Fescennine verses, which continued to charm <lb/>
            the Romans ; until, about a century afterwards, and during <lb/>
            the ravages of a dreadful pestilence, the senate, as the histo­ <lb/>
            rians say, in order to propitiate the gods, called a troop of <lb/>
            players from Tuscany, to assist at the celebration of their <lb/>
            ancient festivals. This was a wise and a salutary measure : <lb/>
            the plague had spread dejection through the city, which was <lb/>
            thus rendered more obnoxious to its fury ; and it therefore be­ <lb/>
            came necessary, by novel and extraordinary amusements, to <lb/>
             <pb n="XIV"/>
            divert the attention of the people from the melancholy objects <lb/>
            around them.</p>
          <p>As the Romans were unacquainted with the language of <lb/>
            Tuscany, the players, Livy tells us, omitted the modulation <lb/>
            and the words, and confined themselves solely to gestures, <lb/>
            which were accompanied by the flute. This imperfect exhi­ <lb/>
            bition, however, was so superior to their own, that the Romans <lb/>
            eagerly strove to attain the art; and, as soon as they could <lb/>
            imitate what they admired, graced their rustic measures with <lb/>
            music and dancing. By degrees they dropped the Fescennine <lb/>
            verses for something of a more regular kind, which now took <lb/>
            the name of SATIRE.1</p>
          <p>These Satires (for as yet they had but little claim to the <lb/>
            title of dramas) continued, without much alteration, to the year <lb/>
            514, when Livius Andronicus, a Greek by birth, and a freed­ <lb/>
            man of L. Salinator, who was undoubtedly acquainted with <lb/>
            the old comedy of his country, produced a regular play. That <lb/>
            it pleased cannot be doubted, for it surpassed the Satires, even <lb/>
            in their improved state ; and, indeed, banished them for some <lb/>
            time from the scene. They had, however, taken too strong a <lb/>
            hold of the affections of the people to be easily forgotten, and it <lb/>
            was therefore found necessary to reproduce and join them to <lb/>
            the plays of Andronicus, (the superiority of which could not <lb/>
            be contested,) under the name of Exodia or After-pieces. <lb/>
            These partook, in a certain degree, of the general amelioration <lb/>
            of the stage ; something like a story was now introduced into <lb/>
            them, which, though frequently indecent and always extrava­ <lb/>
            gant, created a greater degree of interest than the reciprocation <lb/>
            of gross humour and scurrility in unconnected dialogues.</p>
          <p>Whether any of the old people still regretted this sophisti­ <lb/>
            cation of their early amusements, it is not easy to say ; but <lb/>
            Ennius, who came to Rome about twenty years after this <note type="footnote"> 1 The origin of this word is now acknowledged to be Roman. Scaliger <lb/>
            derived it from <foreign xml:lang="grc">σατυρος</foreign>, (satyrus,) but Casaubon, Dacier, and others, <lb/>
            more reasonably, from satura, (fern. of satur,) rich, abounding, full of <lb/>
            variety. In this sense it was applied to the lanx or charger, in which <lb/>
            the various productions of the soil were offered up to the gods ; and thus <lb/>
            came to be used for any miscellaneous collection in general. Satura olla, <lb/>
            a hotch-potch; saturæ leges, laws comprehending a multitude of regula­ <lb/>
            tions, &amp;c. This deduction of the name may serve to explain, in some <lb/>
            measure, the nature of the first Satires, which treated of various subjects, <lb/>
            and were full of various matters: but enough on this trite topic. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="XV"/>
            period, and who was more than half a Grecian, conceived that <lb/>
            he should perform an acceptable service by reviving the ancient <lb/>
            Satires.1 He did not pretend to restore them to the stage, <lb/>
            for which indeed the new pieces were infinitely better calcu­ <lb/>
            lated, but endeavoured to adapt them to the closet, by refining <lb/>
            their grossness and softening their asperity. Success justified <lb/>
            the attempt. Satire, thus freed from action, and formed into <lb/>
            a poem, became a favourite pursuit, and was cultivated by <lb/>
            several writers of eminence. In imitation of his model, Ennius <lb/>
            confined himself to no particular species of verse, nor indeed <lb/>
            of language, for he mingled Greek expressions with his Latin <lb/>
            at pleasure. It is solely with a reference to this new attempt <lb/>
            that Horace and Quintilian are to be understood, when they <lb/>
            claim for the Romans the invention 2 of this kind of poetry ; <note type="footnote"> I It should be observed, however, that the idea was obvious, and the <lb/>
            work itself highly necessary. The old Satire, amidst much coarse ribald­ <lb/>
            ry, frequently attacked the follies and vices of the day. This could not <lb/>
            be done by the comedy which superseded it, and which, by a strange <lb/>
            perversity of taste, was never rendered national. Its customs, manners, <lb/>
            nay, its very plots, were Grecian ; and scarcely more applicable to the <lb/>
            humans than to us. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 To extend this to Lucilius, as is sometimes done, is absurd, since he <lb/>
            evidently had in view the old comedy of the Greeks, of which his Satires, <lb/>
            according to Horace, were rigid imitations : <lb/>
            " Eupolis atque Cratinus, Aristophanesque poëtæ <lb/>
            Atque alii, quorum comœdia prisca virorum est ; <lb/>

            Quod mœchus foret, aut sicarius, aut alioqui <lb/>

            Here the matter would seem to be at once determined by a very compe­ <lb/>
            tent judge. Strip the old Greek comedy of its action, and change the <lb/>
            metre from Iambic to Heroic, and you have the Roman Satire! It is <lb/>
            evident from this, that, unless two things be granted, first, that the actors <lb/>
            in those ancient Satires were ignorant of the existence of the Greek <lb/>
            comedy ; and, secondly, that Ennius, who knew it well, passed it by for <lb/>
            a ruder model; the Romans can have no pretensions to the honour they <lb/>
            claim. </note><note type="footnote"> And even if these be granted, the honour appears to be scarcely worth <lb/>
            the claiming; for the Greeks had not only Dramatic, but Lyric and Heroic <lb/>
            Satire. To pass by the Margites, what were the Iambics of Archilochus, <lb/>
            and the Scazons of Hipponax, but Satires ? nay, what were the Silli ?— <lb/>
            Casaubon derives them a<foreign xml:lang="grc">πο που σιλλαινειν</foreign>, to scoff, to treat petulantly; <lb/>
            and there is no doubt of the justness of his derivation. These little pieces <lb/>
            were made up of passages from vanous poems, which by slight alterations </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="XVI"/>
            and certainly they had opportunities of judging which we <lb/>
            have not, for little of Ennius, and nothing of the old Satire, <lb/>
            remains.</p>
          <p>It is not necessary to pursue the history of Satire further <lb/>
            in this place, or to speak of another species of it, the Varro­ <lb/>
            nian, or, as Varro himself called it, the Menippean, which <lb/>
            branched out from the former, and was a medley of prose and <lb/>
            verse: it will be a more pleasing, as well as a more useful <lb/>
            employ, to enter a little into what Dryden, I know not for <lb/>
            what reason, calls the most difficult part of his undertaking­ <lb/>
            " a comparative view of the Satirists not certainly with the <lb/>
            design of depressing one at the expense of another, (for though <lb/>
            I have translated Juvenal, I have no quarrel with Horace and <lb/>
            Persius,) but for the purpose of pointing out the characteristic <lb/>
            excellencies and defects of them all. To do this the more <note type="footnote"> were humorously or satirically applied at will. The Satires of Ennius <lb/>
            were probably little more ; indeed, we have the express authority of Dio­ <lb/>
            medes the grammarian for it. After speaking of Lucilius, whose writings <lb/>
            he derives, with Horace, from the old comedy, he adds, " et olim carmen, <lb/>
            quod ex variis poematibus constabat, satira vocabatur; quale scripserunt <lb/>
            Pacuvius et Ennius." Modern critics agree in understanding " ex variis <lb/>
            poematibus," of various kinds of metre; but I do not see why it may <lb/>
            not mean, as I have rendered it, " of various poems;" unless we choose <lb/>
            to compliment the Romans, by supposing that what was in the Greeks a <lb/>
            mere cento, was in them an original composition. </note><note type="footnote"> It would scarcely be doing justice, however, to Ennius, to suppose that <lb/>
            he did not surpass his models, for, to say the truth, the Greek Silli ap­ <lb/>
            pear to have been no very extraordinary performances. A few short <lb/>
            specimens of them may be seen in Diogenes Lacrtius, and a longer one, <lb/>
            which has escaped the writers on this subject, in Dio Chrysostom. As <lb/>
            this is, perhaps, the only Greek Satire extant, it may be regarded as a <lb/>
            curiosity; and as such, for as a literary effort it is worth nothing, a short <lb/>
            extract from it may not be uninteresting. Sneering at the people of <lb/>
            Alexandria, for their mad attachment to chariot-races, &amp;c., he says, this <lb/>
            folly of theirs is not ill exposed by one of those scurrilous writers of (Silli, <lb/>
            or) parodies : ou <foreign xml:lang="grc">κακως τις παρεποιησε των σαπρων τουτων ποιητων᾽</foreign> </note> <figure type="illustration">

              effectually, it will be previously necessary to take a cursory <lb/>
              view of the times in which their respective works were pro­ <lb/>
              duced.</p>
          <p>LUCILIUS, to whom Horace, forgetting what he had said in <lb/>
            another place, attributes the invention of Satire, flourished in <lb/>
            the interval between the siege of Carthage and the defeat of <lb/>
            the Cimbri and Teutons, by Marius. He lived therefore in an <lb/>
            age in which the struggle between the old and new manners, <lb/>
            though daily becoming more equal, or rather inclining to the <lb/>
            worse side, was still far from being decided. The freedom of <lb/>
            speaking and writing was yet unchecked by fear, or by any <lb/>
            law more precise than that which, as has been already men­ <lb/>
            tioned, was introduced to restrain the coarse ebullitions of <lb/>
            rustic malignity. Add to this, that Lucilius was of a most <lb/>
            respectable family, (he was great-uncle to Pompey,) and lived <lb/>
            in habits of intimacy with the chiefs of the republic, with <lb/>
            Laelius, Scipio, and others, who were well able to protect him <lb/>
            from the Lupi and Mutii of the day, had they attempted, which <lb/>
            they probably did not, to silence or molest him. Hence that <lb/>
            boldness of satirizing the vicious by name, which startled <lb/>
            Horace, and on which Juvenal and Persius delight to felici­ <lb/>
            tate him.</p>
          <p>Too little remains of Lucilius, to enable us to judge of his <lb/>
            manner: his style seems, however, to bear fewer marks of <lb/>
            delicacy than of strength, and his strictures appear harsh and <lb/>
            violent. With all this, he must have been an extraordinary <lb/>
            man ; since Horace, who is evidently hurt by his reputation, <lb/>
            can say nothing worse of his compositions than that they are <lb/>
            careless and hasty, and that if he had lived at a more refined <lb/>
            period, he would have partaken of the general amelioration. I <lb/>
            do not remember to have heard it observed, but I suspect that <lb/>
            there was something of political spleen in the excessive popu­ <lb/>
            larity of Lucilius under Augustus, and something of courtly <lb/>
            complacency in the attempt of Horace to counteract it. Au­ <lb/>
            gustus enlarged the law of the twelve tables respecting libels ; <lb/>
            and the people, who found themselves thus abridged of the <lb/>
            liberty of satirizing the great by name, might not improbably <lb/>
            seek to avenge themselves, by an overstrained attachment to <lb/>
            the works of a man who, living, as they would insinuate, in <lb/>
            better times, practised without fear, what he enjoyed without <lb/>
            restraint. <note type="footnote"> b </note></p><pb n="XVIII"/>
            
          <p>The space between Horace and his predecessor, was a <lb/>
            dreadful interval " filled up with horror all, and big with <lb/>
            death." Luxury and a long train of vices, which followed <lb/>
            the immense wealth incessantly poured in from the conquered <lb/>
            provinces, sapped the foundations of the republic, which were <lb/>
            finally shaken to pieces by the civil wars, the perpetual dic­ <lb/>
            tatorship of Cæsar, and the second triumvirate, which threw <lb/>
            the Roman world, without a hope of escape, into the power of <lb/>
            an individual.</p>
          <p>Augustus, whose sword was yet reeking with the best blood <lb/>
            of the state, now that submission left him no pretence for fur­ <lb/>
            ther cruelty, was desirous of enjoying in tranquillity the fruits <lb/>
            of his guilt. He displayed, therefore, a magnificence hitherto <lb/>
            unknown ; and his example, which was followed by his min­ <lb/>
            isters, quickly spread among the people, who were not very <lb/>
            unwilling to exchange the agitation and terror of successive <lb/>
            proscriptions, for the security and quiet of undisputed des­ <lb/>
            potism.</p>
          <p>Tiberius had other views, and other methods of accomplish­ <lb/>
            ing them. He did not indeed put an actual stop to the elegant <lb/>
            institutions of his predecessor, but he surveyed them with silent <lb/>
            contempt, and they rapidly degenerated. The race of informers <lb/>
            multiplied with dreadful celerity; and danger, which could <lb/>
            only be averted by complying with a caprice not always easy <lb/>
            to discover, created an abject disposition, fitted for the recep­ <lb/>
            tion of the grossest vices, and eminently favourable to the <lb/>
            designs of the emperor ; which were to procure, by universal <lb/>
            depravation, that submission which Augustus sought to obtain <lb/>
            by the blandishments of luxury and the arts.</p>
          <p>From this gloomy and suspicious tyrant, the empire was <lb/>
            transferred to a profligate madman. It can scarcely be told <lb/>
            without indignation, that when the sword of Chærea had freed <lb/>
            the earth from his disgraceful sway, the senate had not suf­ <lb/>
            ficient virtue to resume the rights of which they had been <lb/>
            deprived ; but, after a timid debate, delivered up the state to <lb/>
            a pedantic dotard, incapable of governing himself.</p>
          <p>To the vices of his predecessors, Nero added a frivolity <lb/>
            which rendered his reign at once odious and contemptible. <lb/>
            Depravity could reach no further, but misery might yet be <lb/>
            extended. This was fully experienced through the turbulent <lb/>
            and murderous usurpations of Galba, Otho, and Vitellius; <lb/>
             <pb n="XIX"/>
            when the accession of Vespasian and Titus gave the groaning <lb/>
            world a temporary respite.</p>
          <p>To these succeeded Domitian, whose crimes form the sub­ <lb/>
            ject of many a melancholy page in the ensuing work, and need <lb/>
            not therefore be dwelt on here. Under him, every trace of <lb/>
            ancient manners was obliterated; liberty was unknown, Jaw <lb/>
            openly trampled upon, and, while the national rites were either <lb/>
            neglected or contemned, a base and blind superstition took <lb/>
            possession of the enfeebled and distempered mind.</p>
          <p>Better times followed. Nerva, and Trajan, and Hadrian, <lb/>
            and the Antonines, restored the Romans to safety and tran­ <lb/>
            quillity ; but they could do no more; liberty and virtue were <lb/>
            gone for ever: and after a short period of comparative happi­ <lb/>
            ness, which they scarcely appear to have deserved, and which <lb/>
            brought with it no amelioration of mind, no return of the <lb/>
            ancient modesty and frugality, they were finally resigned to <lb/>
            destruction.</p>
          <p>I now proceed to the " comparative view " of which I have <lb/>
            already spoken: as the subject has been so often treated, little <lb/>
            of novelty can be expected from it ; to read, compare, and <lb/>
            judge, is almost all that remains.</p>
          <p>HORACE, who was gay, and lively, and gentle, and affec­ <lb/>
            tionate, seems fitted for the period in which he wrote. He <lb/>
            had seen the worst times of the republic, and might therefore, <lb/>
            with no great suspicion of his integrity, be allowed to acqui­ <lb/>
            esce in the infant monarchy, which brought with it stability, <lb/>
            peace, and pleasure. How he reconciled himself to his poli­ <lb/>
            tical tergiversation it is useless to inquire.1 What was so <lb/>
            general, we may suppose, brought with it but little obloquy; <lb/>
            and it should be remembered, to his praise, that he took no <lb/>
            active part in the government which he had once opposed.2 <note type="footnote"> 1 I doubt whether he was ever a good royalist at heart; he frequently, <lb/>
            perhaps unconsciously, betrays a lurking dissatisfaction ; but having, as <lb/>
            Johnson says of a much greater man, " tasted the honey of favour," he <lb/>
            did not choose to return to hunger and philosophy. Indeed, he was not <lb/>
            happy; in the country he sighs for the town, in town for the country; and <lb/>
            he is always restless, and straining after something which he never obtains. <lb/>
            To float, like Aristippus, with the stream, is a bad recipe for felicity; there <lb/>
            must be some fixed principle, by which the passions and desires may be <lb/>
            regulated. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 He is careful to disclaim all participation in public affairs. He ac­ <lb/>
            companies Mæcenas in his carriage; but their chat, he wishes it to be </note> <note type="footnote"> b 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="XX"/>
            If he celebrates the master of the world, it is not until he is <lb/>
            asked by him whether he is ashamed that posterity should <lb/>
            know them to be friends; and he declines a post, which few <lb/>
            of his detractors have merit to deserve, or virtue to refuse.</p>
          <p>His choice of privacy, however, was in some measure con­ <lb/>
            stitutional ; for he had an easiness of temper which bordered <lb/>
            on indolence ; hence he never rises to the dignity of a decided <lb/>
            character. Zeno and Epicurus share his homage and undergo <lb/>
            his ridicule by turns: he passes without difficulty from one <lb/>
            school to another, and he thinks it a sufficient excuse for his <lb/>
            versatility, that he continues, amidst every change, the zealous <lb/>
            defender of virtue. Virtue, however, abstractedly considered, <lb/>
            has few obligations to his zeal.</p>
          <p>But though, as an ethical writer, Horace has not many <lb/>
            claims to the esteem of posterity; as a critic, he is entitled to <lb/>
            all our veneration. Such is the soundness of his judgment, <lb/>
            the correctness of his taste, and the extent and variety of his <lb/>
            knowledge, that a body of criticism might be selected from <lb/>
            his works, more perfect in its kind than any thing which <lb/>
            antiquity has bequeathed us.</p>
          <p>As he had little warmth of temper, he reproves his con­ <lb/>
            temporaries without harshness. He is content to " dwell in <lb/>
            decencies," and, like Pope's courtly dean, " never mentions <lb/>
            hell to ears polite." Persius, who was infinitely better ac­ <lb/>
            quainted with him than we can pretend to be, describes him, <lb/>
            I think, with great happiness: <lb/>
            " Omne vafer vitium ridenti Flaccus amico <lb/>
            Tangit, et admissus circum præcordia ludit, <lb/>
            Callidus excusso populum suspendere naso." <lb/>
            " He, with a sly insinuating grace, <lb/>
            Laugh'd at his friend, and look'd him in the face : <lb/>
            Would raise a blush, where secret vice he found, <lb/>
            And tickle, while he gently probed the wound : <lb/>
            With seeming innocence the crowd beguiled ; <lb/>
            But made the desperate passes when he smiled." <note type="footnote"> believed, is on the common topics of the day, the weather, amusements, <lb/>
            &amp;c. Though this may not be strictly true, it is yet probable that politics <lb/>
            furnished but a small part of their conversation. That both Augustus and <lb/>
            his minister were warmly attached to him, cannot be denied ; but then it <lb/>
            was as to a plaything. In a word, Horace seems to have been the " en­ <lb/>
            fant gat6 " of the palace, and was viewed, I believe, with more tender­ <lb/>
            ness than respect. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="XXI"/>
            These beautiful lines have a defect under which Dryden's <lb/>
            translations frequently labour ; they do not give the true <lb/>
            sense of the original. Horace " raised no blush," (at least <lb/>
            Persius does not insinuate any such thing,) and certainly <lb/>
            " made no desperate passes." 1 His aim rather seems to be, to <lb/>
            keep the objects of his satire in good humour with himself, <lb/>
            and with one another.</p>
          <p>To raise a laugh at vice, however, (supposing it feasible,) <lb/>
            is not the legitimate office of Satire, which is to hold up the <lb/>
            vicious, as objects of reprobation and scorn, for the example <lb/>
            of others, who may be deterred by their sufferings. But it is <lb/>
            time to be explicit. To laugh even at fools is superfluous ;­ <lb/>
            if they understand you, they will join in the merriment; but <lb/>
            more commonly, they will sit with vacant unconcern, and gaze <lb/>
            at their own pictures : to laugh at the vicious, is to encourage <lb/>
            them; for there is in such men a wilfulness of disposition, <lb/>
            which prompts them to bear up against shame, and to show <lb/>
            how little they regard slight reproof, by becoming more au­ <lb/>
            dacious in guilt. Goodness, of which the characteristic is <lb/>
            modesty, may, I fear, be shamed; but vice, like folly, to be <lb/>
            restrained, must be overawed. Labeo, says Hall, with great <lb/>
            energy and beauty­ <lb/>
            " Labeo is whipt, and laughs me in the face ; <lb/>
            Why ? for I smite, and hide the galled place. <lb/>
            Gird but the Cynic's helmet on his head, <lb/>
            Cares he for Talus, or his flayle of lead ? "</p>
          <p>PERSIUS, who borrowed so much of Horace's language, has <lb/>
            little of his manner. The immediate object of his imitation <lb/>
            seems to be Lucilius; and if he lashes vice with less severity <lb/>
            than his great prototype, the cause must not be sought in any <lb/>
            desire to spare what he so evidently condemned. But he was <lb/>
            thrown " on evil times;" he was, besides, of a rank distin­ <lb/>
            guished enough to make his freedom dangerous, and of an <lb/>
            age when life had yet lost little of its novelty; to write, <note type="footnote"> I Mr. Drummond has given this passage with equal elegance and <lb/>
            truth: <lb/>
            " With greater art sly Horace gain'd his end, <lb/>
            But spared no failing of his smiling friend ; <lb/>
            Sportive and pleasant round the heart he play'd, <lb/>
            And wrapt in jests the censure he convey'd ; <lb/>
            With such address his willing victims seized, <lb/>
            That tickled fools were rallied, and were pleased." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="XXII"/>
            therefore, even as he has written, proves him to be a person <lb/>
            of very singular courage and virtue.</p>
          <p>In the interval between Horace and Persius, despotism had <lb/>
            changed its nature: the chains which the policy of Augustus <lb/>
            concealed in flowers, were now displayed in all their hideous­ <lb/>
            ness. The arts were neglected, literature of every kind dis­ <lb/>
            couraged or disgraced, and terror and suspicion substituted <lb/>
            in the place of the former ease and security. Stoicism, which <lb/>
            Cicero accuses of having infected poetry, even in his days, <lb/>
            and of which the professors, as Quintilian observes, always <lb/>
            disregarded the graces and elegancies of composition, spread <lb/>
            with amazing rapidity. 1 In this school Persius was edu­ <lb/>
            cated, under the care of one of its most learned and respect­ <lb/>
            able masters.</p>
          <p>Satire was not his first pursuit; indeed, he seems to have <lb/>
            somewhat mistaken his talents when he applied to it. The <lb/>
            true end of this species of writing, as Dusaulx justly says, <lb/>
            is the improvement of society; but for this, much knowledge <lb/>
            of mankind (" quicquid agunt homines ") is previously neces­ <lb/>
            sary. Whoever is deficient in that, may be an excellent moral <lb/>
            and philosophical poet; but cannot, with propriety, lay claim <lb/>
            to the honours of a satirist.</p>
          <p>And Persius was moral and philosophical in a high degree: <lb/>
            lie was also a poet of no mean order. But while he grew pale <lb/>
            over the page of Zeno, and Cleanthes, and Chrysippus; while <lb/>
            he imbibed, with all the ardour of a youthful mind, the para­ <lb/>
            doxes of those great masters, together with their principles, <lb/>
            the foundations of civil society were crumbling around him, <lb/>
            and soliciting his attention in vain. To judge from what he <lb/>
            has left us, it might almost be affirmed that he was a stranger <lb/>
            in his own country. The degradation of Rome was now com­ <lb/>
            plete ; yet he felt, at least he expresses, no indignation at the <lb/>
            means by which it was effected: a sanguinary buffoon was <note type="footnote"> I Dusaulx accounts for this by the general consternation. Most of <lb/>
            those, he says, distinguished for talents or rank, took refuge in the school <lb/>
            of Zeno; not so much to learn in it how to live, as how to die. I think, <lb/>
            on the contrary, that this would rather have driven them into the arms of <lb/>
            Epicurus. " Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die," will generally <lb/>
            be found, I believe, to be the maxim of dangerous times. It would not <lb/>
            be difficult to show, if this were the place for it, that the prevalency of <lb/>
            Stoicism was due to the increase of profligacy, for which it furnished a <lb/>
            convenient cloak. This, however, does not apply to Persius. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="XXIII"/>
            lording it over the prostrate world ; yet he continued to waste <lb/>
            his most elaborate efforts on the miserable pretensions of pe­ <lb/>
            dants in prose and verse ! If this savour of the impassibility <lb/>
            of Stoicism, it is entitled to no great praise on the score of <lb/>
            outraged humanity, which has stronger claims on a well- <lb/>
            regulated mind, than criticism, or even philosophy.</p>
          <p>Dryden gives that praise to the dogmas of Persius, which <lb/>
            he denies to his poetry. " His verse," he says, " is scabrous <lb/>
            and hobbling, and his measures beneath those of Horace." <lb/>
            This is too severe; for Persius has many exquisite passages, <lb/>
            which nothing in Horace will be found to equal or approach. <lb/>
            The charge of obscurity has been urged against him with <lb/>
            more justice; though this, perhaps, is not so great as it is <lb/>
            usually represented. Casaubon could, without question, have <lb/>
            defended him more successfully than he has done; but he was <lb/>
            overawed by the brutal violence of the elder Scaliger ; for I <lb/>
            can scarcely persuade myself that he really believed this ob­ <lb/>
            scurity to be owing to " the fear of Nero, or the advice of <lb/>
            Cornutus." The cause of it should be rather sought in his <lb/>
            natural disposition, and in his habits of thinking. Generally <lb/>
            speaking, however, it springs from a too frequent use of <lb/>
            tropes, approaching in almost every instance to a catachresis, <lb/>
            an anxiety of compression, and a quick and unexpected trans­ <lb/>
            ition from one over-strained figure to another. After all, <lb/>
            with the exception of the sixth Satire, which, from its ab­ <lb/>
            ruptness, does not appear to have received the author's last <lb/>
            touches, I do not think there is much to confound an attentive <lb/>
            reader : some acquaintance, indeed, with the porch " braccatis <lb/>
            illita Medis," is previously necessary. His life may be con­ <lb/>
            templated with unabated pleasure: the virtue he recommends, <lb/>
            he practised in the fullest extent; and at an age when few <lb/>
            have acquired a determinate character, he left behind him an <lb/>
            established reputation for genius, learning, and worth.</p>
          <p>JUVENAL wrote at a period still more detestable than that <lb/>
            of Persius. Domitian, who now governed the empire, seems <lb/>
            to have inherited the bad qualities of all his predecessors. <lb/>
            Tiberius was not more hypocritical, nor Caligula more bloody, <lb/>
            nor Claudius more sottish, nor Nero more mischievous, than <lb/>
            this ferocious despot; who, as Theodorus Gadareus indig­ <lb/>
            nantly declared of Tiberius, was truly <foreign xml:lang="grc">πηλον αιματι πεφυραμε­ <lb/>
            νον</foreign>, a lump of clay kneaded up with blood !</p><pb n="XXIV"/>
            
          <p>Juvenal, like Persius, professes to follow Lucilius ; but <lb/>
            what was in one a simple attempt, is in the other a real imi­ <lb/>
            tation, of his manner.1 Fluent and witty as Horace, grave <lb/>
            and sublime as Persius ; of a more decided character than the <lb/>
            former, better acquainted with mankind than the latter; he <lb/>
            did not confine himself to the mode of regulating an inter­ <lb/>
            course with the great, or to abstract disquisitions on the na­ <lb/>
            ture of scholastic liberty; but, disregarding the claims of a <lb/>
            vain urbanity, and fixing all his soul on the eternal distinc­ <lb/>
            tions of moral good and evil, he laboured, with a magnificence <lb/>
            of language peculiar to himself, to set forth the loveliness of <lb/>
            virtue, and the deformity and horror of vice, in full and per­ <lb/>
            fect display.</p>
          <p>Dusaulx, who is somewhat prejudiced against Horace, does <lb/>
            ample justice to Juvenal. There is great force in what he <lb/>
            says; and, as I do not know that it ever appeared in English, <lb/>
            I shall take the liberty of laying a part of it before the reader, <lb/>
            at the hazard of a few repetitions.</p>
          <p>" The bloody revolution which smothered the last sighs of <lb/>
            liberty,2 had not yet found time to debase the minds of a <lb/>
            people, amongst whom the traditionary remains of the old <lb/>
            manners still subsisted. The cruel but politic Octavius scat­ <lb/>
            tered flowers over the paths he was secretly tracing towards <lb/>
            despotism: the arts of Greece, transplanted to the Capitol, <lb/>
            flourished beneath his auspices; and the remembrance of so <lb/>
            many civil dissensions, succeeding each other with increasing <lb/>
            rapidity, excited a degree of reverence for the author of this <lb/>
            unprecedented tranquillity. The Romans felicitated them- <note type="footnote"> I I believe that Juvenal meant to describe himself in the following <lb/>
            spirited picture of Lucilius :— <lb/>
            " Ense velut stricto quoties Lucilius ardens <lb/>
            Infremuit, rubet auditor, cui frigida mens est <lb/>
            Criminibus, tacita sudant præcordia culpa." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This is an error which has been so often repeated, that it is believed. <lb/>
            What liberty was destroyed by the usurpation of Augustus ? For more <lb/>
            than half a century, Rome had been a prey to ambitious chiefs, while five <lb/>
            or six civil wars, each more bloody than the other, had successively de­ <lb/>
            livered up the franchises of the empire to the conqueror of the day. The <lb/>
            Gracchi first opened the career to ambition, and wanted nothing but the <lb/>
            means of corruption, which the East afterwards supplied, to effect what <lb/>
            Marius, Sylla, and the two triumvirates brought about with sufficient <lb/>
            ease. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="XXV"/>
            selves at not lying down, as before, with an apprehension of <lb/>
            finding themselves included, when they awoke, in the list of <lb/>
            proscription: and neglected, amidst the amusements of the <lb/>
            circus and the theatre, those civil rights of which their fathers <lb/>
            had been so jealous.</p>
          <p>" Profiting of these circumstances, Horace forgot that he <lb/>
            had combated on the side of liberty. A better courtier than <lb/>
            a soldier, he clearly saw how far the refinement, the graces, <lb/>
            and the cultivated state of his genius (qualities not much con­ <lb/>
            sidered or regarded till his time 1) were capable of advancing <lb/>
            him, without any extraordinary effort.</p>
          <p>" Indifferent to the future, and not daring to recall the past, <lb/>
            he thought of nothing but securing himself from all that could <lb/>
            sadden the mind, and disturb the system which he had skil­ <lb/>
            fully arranged on the credit of those then in power. It is on <lb/>
            this account, that, of all his contemporaries, he has celebrated <lb/>
            none but the friends of his master, or, at least, those whom <lb/>
            he could praise without fear of compromising his favour.</p>
          <p>" In what I have said of Horace, my chief design has been <lb/>
            to show that this Proteus, who counted among his friends and <lb/>
            admirers even those whose conduct he censured, chose rather, <lb/>
            to capitulate than contend; that he attached no great import­ <lb/>
            ance to his own rules, and adhered to his principles no longer <lb/>
            than they favoured his views.</p>
          <p>"JUVENAL began his satiric career where the other finished, <lb/>
            that is to say, lie did that for morals and liberty, which Horace <lb/>
            had done for decorum and taste. Disdaining artifice of every <lb/>
            kind, he boldly raised his voice against the usurpation of <lb/>
            power; and incessantly recalled the memory of the glorious <lb/>
            era of independence to those degenerate Romans, who had <lb/>
            substituted suicide in the place of their ancient courage ; and <lb/>
            from the days of Augustus to those of Domitian, only avenged <lb/>
            their slavery by an epigram or a bon-mot.</p>
          <p>" The characteristics of Juvenal were energy, passion, and <lb/>
            indignation: it is, nevertheless, easy to discover that lie is <note type="footnote"> I This is a very strange observation. It looks as if Dusaulx had leaped <lb/>
            from the times of old Metellus to those of Augustus, without casting a <lb/>
            glance at the interval. The chef d'œuvres of Roman literature were in <lb/>
            every hand, when he supposed them to be neglected : and, indeed, if <lb/>
            Horace had left us nothing, the qualities of which Dusaulx speaks, might <lb/>
            still be found in many works produced before he was known. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="XXVI"/>
            sometimes more afilicted than exasperated. His great aim <lb/>
            was to alarm the vicious, and, if possible, to exterminate vice, <lb/>
            which had, as it were, acquired a legal establishment. A noble <lb/>
            enterprise! but be wrote in a detestable age, when the laws <lb/>
            of nature were publicly violated, and the love of their country <lb/>
            so completely eradicated from the breasts of his fellow-citizens, <lb/>
            that, brutified as they were by slavery and voluptuousness, by <lb/>
            luxury and avarice, they merited rather the severity of the <lb/>
            executioner than the censor.</p>
          <p>“ Meanwhile the empire, shaken to its foundations, was <lb/>
            rapidly crumbling to dust. Despotism was consecrated by the <lb/>
            senate; liberty, of which a few slaves were still sensible, was <lb/>
            nothing but an unmeaning word for the rest, which, unmean­ <lb/>
            ing as it was, they did not dare to pronounce in public. Men <lb/>
            of rank were declared enemies to the state for having praised <lb/>
            their equals; historians were condemned to the cross, phi­ <lb/>
            losophy was proscribed, and its professors banished. Indi­ <lb/>
            viduals felt only for their own danger, which they too often <lb/>
            averted by accusing others ; and there were instances of chil­ <lb/>
            dren who denounced their own parents, and appeared as <lb/>
            witnesses against them ! It was not possible to weep for the <lb/>
            proscribed, for tears themselves became the object of proscrip­ <lb/>
            tion ; and when the tyrant of the day had condemned the <lb/>
            accused to banishment or death, the senate decreed that he <lb/>
            should be thanked for it, as for an act of singular favour.</p>
          <p>" Juvenal, who looked upon the alliance of the agreeable <lb/>
            with the odious as utterly incompatible, contemned the feeble <lb/>
            weapon of ridicule, so familiar to his predecessor: he there­ <lb/>
            fore seized the sword of Satire, or, to speak more properly, <lb/>
            fabricated one for himself, and rushing from the palace to the <lb/>
            tavern, and from the gates of Rome to the boundaries of the <lb/>
            empire, struck, without distinction, whoever deviated from the <lb/>
            course of nature, or from the paths of honour. It is no longer <lb/>
            a poet like Horace, fickle, pliant, and fortified with that in­ <lb/>
            difference so falsely called philosophical, who amused himself <lb/>
            with bantering vice, or, at most, with upbraiding a few errors <lb/>
            of little consequence, in a style, which, scarcely raised above <lb/>
            the language of conversation, flowed as indolence and pleasure <lb/>
            directed ; but a stern and incorruptible censor, an inflamed <lb/>
            and impetuous poet, who sometimes rises with his subject to <lb/>
            the noblest heights of tragedy."</p><pb n="XXVII"/>
            
          <p>From this declamatory applause, which even La Harpe <lb/>
            allows to be worthy of the translator of Juvenal, the most <lb/>
            rigid censurer of our author cannot detract much ; nor can <lb/>
            much perhaps be added to it by his warmest admirer. I <lb/>
            could, indeed, have wished that he had not exalted him at the <lb/>
            expense of Horace ; but something must be allowed for the <lb/>
            partiality of long acquaintance; and Casaubon, when he pre­ <lb/>
            ferred Persius, with whom he had taken great, and indeed <lb/>
            successful pains, to Horace and Juvenal, sufficiently exposed, <lb/>
            while he tacitly accounted for, the prejudices of commentators <lb/>
            and translators. With respect to Horace, if he falls beneath I <lb/>
            Juvenal (and who does not?) in eloquence, in energy, and in <lb/>
            a vivid and glowing imagination, he evidently surpasses him <lb/>
            in taste and critical judgment. I could pursue the parallel <lb/>
            through a thousand ramifications, but the reader who does me <lb/>
            the honour to peruse the following sheets, will see that I have <lb/>
            incidentally touched upon some of them in the notes: and, <lb/>
            indeed, I preferred scattering my observations through the <lb/>
            work, as they arose from the subject, to bringing them to­ <lb/>
            gether in this place ; where they must evidently have lost <lb/>
            something of their pertinency, without much certainty of <lb/>
            gaining in their effect.</p>
          <p>Juvenal is accused of being too sparing of praise. But are <lb/>
            his critics well assured that praise from Juvenal could be ac­ <lb/>
            cepted with safety ? I do not know that a private station was <lb/>
            " the post of honour " in those days ; it was, however, that of <lb/>
            security. Martial, Statius, V. Flaccus, and other parasites <lb/>
            of Domitian, might indeed venture to celebrate their friends, <lb/>
            who were also those of the emperor. Juvenal's, it is proba­ <lb/>
            ble, were of another kind ; and he might have been influenced <lb/>
            no less by humanity than prudence, in the sacred silence <lb/>
            which he has observed respecting them. Let it not be forgot­ <lb/>
            ten, however, that this intrepid champion of virtue, who, under <lb/>
            the twelfth despot, persisted, as Dusaulx observes, in recog­ <lb/>
            nising no sovereign but the senate, while he passes by those <lb/>
            whose safety his applause might endanger, has generously <lb/>
            celebrated the ancient assertors of liberty, in strains that <lb/>
            Tyrtæus might have wished his own.</p>
          <p>He is also charged with being too rhetorical in his language. <lb/>
            The critics have discovered that he practised at the bar, and <lb/>
            they will therefore have it that his Satires smack of his pro­ <lb/>
             <pb n="XXVIII"/>
            fession, " redolent declamatorem.” 1 That he is luxuriant, or, <lb/>
            if it must be so, redundant, may be safely granted; but I <lb/>
            doubt whether the passages which are cited for proofs of this <lb/>
            fault, were not reckoned amongst his beauties, by his contem­ <lb/>
            poraries. The enumeration of deities in the thirteenth Satire <lb/>
            is well defended by Rigaltius, who admits, at the same time, <lb/>
            that if the author had inserted it any where but in a Satire, <lb/>
            he should have accounted him a babbler; “faterer Juv. hic <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">περιλαλον</foreign> fuisse et verborum prodigum." He appears to me <lb/>
            equally successful, in justifying the list of oaths in the same <lb/>
            Satire, which Creech, it appears, had not the courage to <lb/>
            translate.</p>
          <p>The other passages adduced in support of this charge, are <lb/>
            either metaphorical exaggerations, or long traits of indirect <lb/>
            Satire, of which Juvenal was as great a master as Horace. <lb/>
            I do not say that these are interesting to us; but they were <lb/>
            eminently so to those for whom they were written; and by <lb/>
            their pertinency at the time, should they, by every rule of fair <lb/>
            criticism, be estimated. The version of such passages is one <lb/>
            of the miseries of translation.</p>
          <p>I have also heard it objected to Juvenal, that there is in <lb/>
            many of his Satires a want of arrangement; this is particularly <lb/>
            observed of the sixth and tenth. I scarcely know what to <lb/>
            reply to this. Those who are inclined to object, would not <lb/>
            be better satisfied, perhaps, if the form of both were changed <lb/>
            for I suspect that there is no natural gradation in the in­ <lb/>
            numerable passions which agitate the human breast. Some <lb/>
            must precede, and others follow; but the order of march is <lb/>
            not, nor ever was, invariable. While I acquit him of this, <lb/>
            however, I readily acknowledge a want of care in many places, <lb/>
            unless it be rather attributable to a want of taste. On some <lb/>
            occasions, too, when he changed or enlarged his first sketch, <note type="footnote"> 1 I have often wished that we had some of the pleadings of Juvenal. <lb/>
            It cannot be affirmed, I think, that there is any natural connexion be­ <lb/>
            tween prose and verse in the same mind, though it may be observed, that <lb/>
            most of our celebrated poets have written admirably " soluta oratione:” <lb/>
            yet if Juvenal's oratory bore any resemblance to his poetry, he yielded to <lb/>
            few of the best ornaments of the bar. The " torrens dicendi copia " was <lb/>
            his, in an eminent degree ; nay, so full, so rich, so strong, and so mag­ <lb/>
            nificent is his eloquence, that I have heard one well qualified to judge, <lb/>
            frequently declare that Cicero himself, in his estimation, could hardly be <lb/>
            said to surpass him. </note> <lb/>

            he forgot to strike out the unnecessary verses: to this are <lb/>
            owing the repetitions to be found in his longer works, as well <lb/>
            as the transpositions, which have so often perplexed the critics <lb/>
            and translators.</p>
          <p>Now I am upon this subject, I must not pass over a sloven­ <lb/>
            liness in some of his lines, for which he has been justly re­ <lb/>
            proached by Jortin and others, as it would have cost him no <lb/>
            great pains to improve them. Why he should voluntarily <lb/>
            debase his poetry, it is difficult to say : if he thought that be <lb/>
            was imitating Horace in his laxity, his judgment must suffer <lb/>
            considerably. The verses of Horace are indeed akin to prose ; <lb/>
            but as he seldom rises, he has the art of making his low flights, <lb/>
            in which all his motions are easy and graceful, appear the <lb/>
            effect of choice. Juvenal was qualified to " sit where he dared <lb/>
            not soar." His element was that of the eagle, “ descent and <lb/>
            fall to him were adverse," and, indeed, he never appears more <lb/>
            awkward than when he flutters, or rather waddles, along the <lb/>
            ground.</p>
          <p>, I have observed in the course of the translation, that he <lb/>
            embraced no sect with warmth. In a man of such lively pas­ <lb/>
            sions, the retention With which be speaks of them all, is to be <lb/>
            admired. From his attachment to the writings of Seneca, I <lb/>
            should incline to think that he leaned towards Stoicism ; his <lb/>
            predilection for the school, however, was not very strong : <lb/>
            perhaps it is to be wished that he had entered a little more <lb/>
            deeply into it, as he seems not to have those distinct ideas of <lb/>
            the nature of virtue and vice, which were entertained by many <lb/>
            of the ancient philosophers, and indeed, by his immediate pre­ <lb/>
            decessor, Persius. As a general champion for virtue, he is <lb/>
            commonly successful, but he sometimes misses his aim; and, <lb/>
            in more than one instance, confounds the nature of the several <lb/>
            vices in his mode of attacking them: he confounds too the <lb/>
            very essence of virtue, which, in his hands, has often “ no <lb/>
            local habitation and name," but varies with the ever-varying <lb/>
            passions and caprices of mankind. I know not whether it be <lb/>
            worth while to add, that he is accused of holding a different <lb/>
            language at different times respecting the gods, since in this <lb/>
            he differs little from the Greek and Roman poets in general; <lb/>
            who, as often as they introduce their divinities, state, as Ju­ <lb/>
            venal does, the mythological circumstances coupled with their <lb/>
            names, without regard to the existing system of physic or <lb/>
             <pb n="XXX"/>
            morals. When they speak from themselves, indeed, they give <lb/>
            us exalted sentiments of virtue and sound philosophy; when <lb/>
            they indulge in poetic recollections, they present us with the <lb/>
            fables of antiquity. Hence the gods are alternately, and as <lb/>
            the subject requires, venerable or contemptible ; and this could <lb/>
            not but happen through the want of some acknowledged re­ <lb/>
            ligious standard, to which all might with confidence refer.</p>
          <p>I come now to a more serious charge against Juvenal, that <lb/>
            of indecency. To hear the clamour raised against him, it <lb/>
            might be supposed, by one unacquainted with the times, that <lb/>
            he was the only indelicate writer of his age and country. Yet <lb/>
            Horace and Persius wrote with equal grossness : yet the rigid <lb/>
            Stoicism of Seneca did not deter him from the use of expres­ <lb/>
            sions, which Juvenal perhaps would have rejected: yet the <lb/>
            courtly Pliny poured out gratuitous indecencies in his frigid <lb/>
            hendecasyllables, which he attempts to justify by the example <lb/>
            of a writer to whose freedom the licentiousness of Juvenal is <lb/>
            purity! It seems as if there was something of pique in the <lb/>
            singular severity with which he is censured. His pure and <lb/>
            sublime morality operates as a tacit reproach on the generality <lb/>
            of mankind, who seek to indemnify themselves by questioning <lb/>
            the sanctity which they cannot but respect; and find a secret <lb/>
            pleasure in persuading one another that “ this dreaded sa­ <lb/>
            tirist " was at heart no inveterate enemy to the licentiousness <lb/>
            which he so vehemently reprehends.</p>
          <p>When we consider the unnatural vices at which Juvenal <lb/>
            directs his indignation, and reflect, at the same time, on the <lb/>
            peculiar qualities of his mind, we shall not find much cause, <lb/>
            perhaps, for wonder at the strength of his expressions. I should <lb/>
            resign him in silence to the hatred of mankind, if his aim, like <lb/>
            that of too many others, whose works are read with delight, <lb/>
            had been to render vice amiable, to fling his seducing colours <lb/>
            over impurity, and inflame the passions by meretricious hints <lb/>
            at what is only innoxious when exposed in native deformity: <lb/>
            but when I find that his views are to render depravity loath­ <lb/>
            some ; that every thing which can alarm and disgust is di­ <lb/>
            rected at her in his terrible page, I forget the grossness of the <lb/>
            execution in the excellence of the design ; and pay my invo­ <lb/>
            luntary homage to that integrity, which fearlessly calling in <lb/>
            strong description to the aid of virtue, attempts to purify the <lb/>
            passions, at the hazard of wounding delicacy and offending <lb/>
             <pb n="XXXI"/>
            taste. This is due to Juvenal: in justice to myself, let me <lb/>
            add, that I could have been better pleased to have had no <lb/>
            occasion to speak at all on the subject.</p>
          <p>Whether any considerations of this or a similar nature de­ <lb/>
            terred our literati from turning these Satires into English, I <lb/>
            cannot say; but, though partial versions might be made, it <lb/>
            was not until the beginning of the seventeenth century that a <lb/>
            complete translation was thought of; when two men, of ce­ <lb/>
            lebrity in their days, undertook it about the same time; these <lb/>
            were Barten Holyday and Sir Robert Stapylton. Who en­ <lb/>
            tered first upon the task, cannot well be told. There appears <lb/>
            somewhat of a querulousness on both sides; a jealousy that <lb/>
            their versions had been communicated in manuscript to each <lb/>
            other: Stapylton's, however, was first published, though that <lb/>
            of Holyday seems to have been first finished.</p>
          <p>Of this ingenious man it is not easy to speak with too much <lb/>
            respect. His learning, industry, judgment, and taste are <lb/>
            every where conspicuous :-nor is he without a very consider­ <lb/>
            able portion of shrewdness to season his observations. His <lb/>
            poetry indeed, or rather his ill-measured prose, is intolerable; <lb/>
            no human patience can toil through a single page of it;1 but <lb/>
            his notes will always be consulted with pleasure. His work <lb/>
            has been of considerable use to the subsequent editors of <lb/>
            Juvenal, both at home and abroad; and indeed, such is its <lb/>
            general accuracy, that little excuse remains for any notorious <lb/>
            deviation from the sense of the original.</p>
          <p>Stapylton had equal industry, and more poetry; but he <lb/>
            wanted his learning, judgment, and ingenuity. His notes, <lb/>
            though numerous, are trite, and scarcely beyond the reach of <lb/>
            a school-boy. He is besides scandalously indecent on many <lb/>
            occasions, where his excellent rival was innocently unfaithful, <lb/>
            or silent.</p>
          <p>With these translations, such as they were, the public was <lb/>
            satisfied until the end of the seventeenth century, when the <lb/>
            necessity of something more poetical becoming apparent, the <lb/>
            booksellers, as Johnson says, " proposed a new version to the <note type="footnote"> I With all my respect for the learning of this good old man, it is im­ <lb/>
            possible, now and then, to suppress a smile at his simplicity. In apolo­ <lb/>
            gizing for his translation, he says: " As for publishing poetry, it needs <lb/>
            no defence ; there being, if my Lord of Verulam’s judgment shall be ad­ <lb/>
            mitted, ' a divine rapture in it!'" </note> <lb/>

            poets of that time, which was undertaken by Dryden, whose <lb/>
            reputation was such, that no man was unwilling to serve the <lb/>
            Muses under him."</p>
          <p>Dryden's account of this translation is given with such can­ <lb/>
            dour, in the exquisite dedication which precedes it, that I shall <lb/>
            lay it before the reader in his own words.</p>
          <p>" The common way which we have taken, is not a literal <lb/>
            translation, but a kind of paraphrase, or somewhat which <lb/>
            is yet more loose, betwixt a paraphrase and a translation. <lb/>
            Thus much may be said for us, that if we give not the whole <lb/>
            sense of Juvenal, yet we give the most considerable part <lb/>
            of it: we give it, in general, so clearly, that few notes are <lb/>
            sufficient to make us intelligible : we make our author at least <lb/>
            appear in a poetie dress. We have actually made him more <lb/>
            sounding, and more elegant, than he was before in English: <lb/>
            and have endeavoured to make him speak that kind of English, <lb/>
            which he would have spoken had he lived in England, and had <lb/>
            written to this age. If sometimes any of us (and it is but <lb/>
            seldom) make him express the customs and manners of his <lb/>
            native country, rather than of Rome, it is, either when there <lb/>
            was some kind of analogy betwixt their customs and ours, or <lb/>
            when, to make him more easy to vulgar understandings, we <lb/>
            gave him those manners which are familiar to us. But I de­ <lb/>
            fend not this innovation, it is enough if I can excuse it. For <lb/>
            to speak sincerely, the manners of nations and ages are not to <lb/>
            be confounded.”1</p>
          <p>This is, surely, sufficiently modest. Johnson's description <lb/>
            of it is somewhat more favourable : " The general character <lb/>
            of this translation will be given, when it is said to preserve the <lb/>
            wit, but to want the dignity, of the original." Is this correct ? <lb/>
            Dryden frequently degrades the author into a jester; but <note type="footnote"> I He evidently alludes to the versions of the second and eighth Satires <lb/>
            by Tate and Stepney, but principally to the latter, in which Juvenal <lb/>
            illustrates his argument by the practice of Smithtield and Newmarket! <lb/>
            Indeed, Dryden himself, though confessedly aware of its impropriety, is <lb/>
            not altogether free from " innovation ;" he talks of the Park, and the <lb/>
            Mall, and the Opera, and of many other objects, familiar to the translator, <lb/>
            but which the original writer could only know by the spirit of prophecy. </note><note type="footnote"> I am sensible how difficult it is to keep the manners of different ages <lb/>
            perfectly distinct in a work like this : I have never knowingly confounded <lb/>
            them, and, I trust, not often inadvertently ; yet more occasions perhaps of <lb/>
            exercising the reader's candour will appear, after all, than are desirable. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="XXXIII"/>
            Juvenal has few moments of levity. Wit, indeed, he possesses <lb/>
            in an eminent degree, but it is tinctured with his peculiarities ; <lb/>
            “ rar<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὸ</foreign> jocos," as Lipsius well observes, “ sæpius acerbos sales <lb/>
            miscet." Dignity is the predominant quality of his mind : he <lb/>
            can, and does, relax with grace, but he never forgets himself; <lb/>
            he smiles, indeed; but his smile is more terrible than his frown, <lb/>
            for it is never excited but when his indignation is mingled <lb/>
            with contempt; " ridet et odit!" Where his dignity, there­ <lb/>
            fore, is wanting, his wit will be imperfectly preserved.1</p>
          <p>On the whole, there is nothing in this quotation to deter <lb/>
            succeeding writers from attempting, at least, to supply the <lb/>
            deficiencies of Dryden and his fellow-labourers ; and, perhaps, <lb/>
            I could point out several circumstances which might make it <lb/>
            laudable, if not necessary:-but this would be to trifle with <lb/>
            the reader, who is already apprized that, as far as relates to <lb/>
            myself, no motives but those of obedience determined me to <lb/>
            the task for which I now solicit the indulgence of the public.</p>
          <p>When I took up this author, I knew not of any other trans­ <lb/>
            lator ; nor was it until the scheme of publishing him was <lb/>
            started, that I began to reflect seriously on the nature of what <lb/>
            I had undertaken, to consider by what exertions I could ren­ <lb/>
            der that useful which was originally meant to amuse, and <lb/>
            justify, in some measure, the partiality of my benefactors.</p>
          <p>My first object was to become as familiar as possible with <lb/>
            my author, of whom I collected every edition that my own <lb/>
            interest, or that of my friends, could procure ; together with <lb/>
            such translations as I could discover either here or abroad: <lb/>
            from a careful examination of all these, I formed the plan, to <lb/>
            which, while I adapted my former labours, I anxiously strove <lb/>
            to accommodate my succeeding ones.</p>
          <p>Dryden has said, " if we give not the whole, yet we give <lb/>
            the most considerable part of it." My determination was to <note type="footnote"> 1 Yet Johnson knew him well. The peculiarity of Juvenal, he says, <lb/>
            (vol. ix. p. 424,) " is a mixture of gaiety and stateliness, of pointed sen­ <lb/>
            tences, and declamatory grandeur." A good idea of it may be formed <lb/>
            from his own beautiful imitation of the third Satire. His imitation of the <lb/>
            tenth (still more beautiful as a poem) has scarcely a trait of the author's <lb/>
            manner ;-that is to say, of that " mixture of gaiety and stateliness," <lb/>
            which, according to his own definition, constitutes the " peculiarity of <lb/>
            Juvenal." " The Vanity of Human Wishes ” is uniformly stately and <lb/>
            severe, and without those light and popular strokes of sarcasm which <lb/>
            abound so much in his “ London." </note> <note type="footnote"> c </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="XXXIV"/>
            give the whole, and really make the work what it professed to <lb/>
            be, a translation of Juvenal. I had seen enough of castrated <lb/>
            editions, to observe that little was gained by them on the score <lb/>
            of propriety; since, when the author was reduced to half his <lb/>
            bulk, at the expense of his spirit and design, sufficient re­ <lb/>
            mained to alarm the delicacy for which the sacrifice had been <lb/>
            made. Chaucer observes with great naivete, <lb/>
            " Whoso shall tell a tale after a man, <lb/>
            He moste reherse as neighe as ever he can <lb/>
            Everieh word, if it be in his charge, <lb/>
            All speke he never so rudely and so large." <lb/>
            And indeed the age of Chaucer, like that of Juvenal, al­ <lb/>
            lowed of such liberties. Other times, other manners. Many <lb/>
            words were in common use with our ancestors, which raised <lb/>
            no improper ideas, though they would not, and indeed could <lb/>
            not, at this time be tolerated. With the Greeks and Romans <lb/>
            it was still worse: their dress, which left many parts of the <lb/>
            body exposed, gave a boldness to their language, which was <lb/>
            not perhaps lessened by the infrequency of women at those <lb/>
            social conversations, of which they now constitute the refine­ <lb/>
            ment and the delight. Add to this, that their mythology, and <lb/>
            sacred rites, which took their rise in very remote periods, <lb/>
            abounded in the undisguised phrases of a rude and simple age, <lb/>
            and being religiously handed down from generation to gener­ <lb/>
            ation, gave a currency to many terms, which offered no vio­ <lb/>
            lence to modesty, though abstractedly considered by people of <lb/>
            a different language and manners, they appear pregnant with <lb/>
            turpitude and guilt.</p>
          <p>When we observe this licentiousness (for I should wrong <lb/>
            many of the ancient writers to call it libertinism) in the pages <lb/>
            of their historians and philosophers, we may be pretty conn­ <lb/>
            dent that it raised no blush on the cheek of their readers. It <lb/>
            was the language of the times—“ hæc illis natura est omnibus <lb/>
            una:" and if it be considered as venial in those, surely a little <lb/>
            further indulgence will not be misapplied to the satirist, whose <lb/>
            object is the exposure of what the former have only to notice.</p>
          <p>Thus much may suffice for Juvenal: but shame and sorrow <lb/>
            on the head of him, who presumes to transfer his grossness <lb/>
            into the vernacular tongues ! " Legimus aliqua ne legantur," <lb/>
            was said of old, by one of a pure and zealous mind. Without <lb/>
            pretending to his high motives, I have felt the influence of <lb/>
             <pb n="XXXV"/>
            his example, and in his apology must therefore hope to find <lb/>
            my own. Though the poet be given'entire, I have endea­ <lb/>
            voured to make him speak as he would probably have spoken <lb/>
            if he had lived among us; when, refined with the age, he <lb/>
            would have fulminated against impurity in terms, to which, <lb/>
            though delicacy might disavow them, manly decency might <lb/>
            listen without offence.</p>
          <p>I have said above, that “ the whole of Juvenal" is here <lb/>
            given ; this, however, must be understood with a few restric­ <lb/>
            tions. Where vice, of whatever nature, formed the immediate <lb/>
            object of reprobation, it has not been spared in the transla­ <lb/>
            tion ; but I have sometimes taken the liberty of omitting an <lb/>
            exceptionable line, when it had no apparent connexion with <lb/>
            the subject of the Satire. Some acquaintance with the original <lb/>
            will be necessary to discover these lacunae, which do not, in <lb/>
            all, amount to half a page: for the rest, I have no apologies <lb/>
            to make. Here are no allusions, covert or open, to the follies <lb/>
            and vices of modern times ; nor has the dignity of the original <lb/>
            been prostituted, in a single instance, to the gratification of <lb/>
            private spleen.</p>
          <p>I have attempted to follow, as far as I judged it feasible, <lb/>
            the style of my author, which is more various than is usually <lb/>
            supposed. It is not necessary to descend to particulars ; but <lb/>
            my meaning will be understood by those, who carefully com­ <lb/>
            pare the original of the thirteenth and fourteenth Satires with <lb/>
            the translation. In the twelfth, and in that alone, I have <lb/>
            perhaps raised it a little ; but it really appears so contemptible <lb/>
            a performance in the doggerel of Dryden's coadjutor, that I <lb/>
            thought somewhat more attention than ordinary was in justice <lb/>
            due to it. It is not a chef-d’œuvre by any means ; but it is <lb/>
            a pretty and a pleasing little poem, deserving more notice than <lb/>
            it has. usually received.</p>
          <p>I could have been sagacious and obscure on many occasions, <lb/>
            with very little difficulty; but I strenuously combated every <lb/>
            inclination to find out more than my author meant. The <lb/>
            general character of this translation, if I do not deceive my­ <lb/>
            self, will be found to be plainness; and, indeed, the highest <lb/>
            praise to which I aspire, is that of having left the original <lb/>
            more intelligible to the English reader than I found it.</p>
          <p>On numbering the lines, I find that my translation contains <lb/>
            a few less than Dryden's. Had it been otherwise, I should <note type="footnote"> c 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="XXXVI"/>
            not have thought an apology necessary, nor would it perhaps <lb/>
            appear extraordinary, when it is considered that I have in­ <lb/>
            troduced an infinite number of circumstances from the text, <lb/>
            which he thought himself justified in omitting; and that, with <lb/>
            the trifling exceptions already mentioned, nothing has been <lb/>
            passed; whereas he and his assistants overlooked whole see­ <lb/>
            tions, and sometimes very considerable ones.1 Every where, <lb/>
            too, I have endeavoured to render the transitions less abrupt, <lb/>
            and to obviate or disguise, the difficulties which a difference <lb/>
            of manners, habits, &amp;c., necessarily creates: all this calls for <lb/>
            an additional number of lines; which the English reader, at <lb/>
            least, will seldom have occasion to regret.</p>
          <p>Of the “ borrowed learning of notes," which Dryden says <lb/>
            he avoided as much as possible, I have amply availed myself. <lb/>
            During the long period in which my thoughts were fixed on <lb/>
            Juvenal, it was usual with me, whenever I found a passage <lb/>
            that related to him, to impress it on my memory, or to note it <lb/>
            down. These, on the revision of the work for publication, <lb/>
            were added to such reflections as arose in my own mind, and <lb/>
            arranged in the manner in which they now appear. I confess <lb/>
            that this was not an unpleasant task to me, and I will venture <lb/>
            to hope, that if my own suggestions fail to please, yet the fre­ <lb/>
            quent recurrence of some of the most striking and beautiful <lb/>
            passages of ancient and modern poetry, history, &amp;c., will ren­ <lb/>
            der it neither unamusing nor uninstructive to the general <lb/>
            reader. The information insinuated into the mind by miscel­ <lb/>
            laneous collections of this nature, is much greater than is <lb/>
            usually imagined ; and I have been frequently encouraged to <lb/>
            proceed, by recollecting the benefits which I formerly derived <lb/>
            from casual notices scattered over the margin, or dropped at <lb/>
            the bottom of a page.</p>
          <p>In this compilation, I proceeded on no regular plan, further <lb/>
            than considering what, if I had been a mere English reader, <lb/>
            I should wish to have had explained : it is therefore extremely <lb/>
            probable, as every rule of this nature must be imperfect, that <lb/>
            I have frequently erred ; have spoken where I should be silent, <lb/>
            and been prolix where I should be brief: on the whole, how­ <lb/>
            ever, I chose to offend on the safer side ; and to leave nothing <note type="footnote"> I In the fourteenth Satire, for example, there is an omission of fifteen <lb/>
            lines, and this, too, in a passage of singular importance. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="XXXVII"/>
            unsaid, at the hazard of sometimes saying too much. Tedious, <lb/>
            perhaps, I may be; but, I trust, not dull ; and with this ne­ <lb/>
            gative commendation I must be satisfied. The passages pro­ <lb/>
            duced are not always translated; but the English reader <lb/>
            needs not for that be discouraged in proceeding, as he will <lb/>
            frequently find sufficient in the context to give him a general <lb/>
            idea of the meaning. In many places I have copied the words, <lb/>
            together with the sentiments of the writer; for this, if it call <lb/>
            for an apology, I shall take that of Macrobius, who had some­ <lb/>
            what more occasion for it than I shall be found to have : “ Net: <lb/>
            mihi vitio vertas, si res quas ex lectione varia mutuabor, ipsis <lb/>
            sæpè verbis quibus ab ipsis auctoribus enarratoe sunt expli­ <lb/>
            cabo, quia proesens opus non eloquentiæ ostentationem, sed <lb/>
            noscendorum congeriem pollicetur," &amp;c. Saturn. lib. i. c. 1.</p>
          <p>I have now said all that occurs to me on this subject: a <lb/>
            more pleasing one remains. I cannot, indeed, like Dryden, <lb/>
            boast of my poetical coadjutors. No Congreves and Creeches <lb/>
            have abridged, while they adorned, my labours; yet have I <lb/>
            not been without assistance, and of the most valuable kind.</p>
          <p>Whoever is acquainted with the habits of intimacy in which <lb/>
            I have lived from early youth with the Rev. Dr. Ireland, 1 <lb/>
            will not want to be informed of his share in the following <lb/>
            pages. To those who are not, it is proper to say, that besides <lb/>
            the passages in which he is introduced by name, every other <lb/>
            part of the work has been submitted to his inspection. Nor <lb/>
            would his affectionate anxiety for the reputation of his friend <lb/>
            suffer any part of the translation to appear, without undergoing <lb/>
            the strictest revision. His uncommon accuracy, judgment, <lb/>
            and learning have been uniformly exerted on it, not less, I <lb/>
            am confident, to the advantage of the reader, than to my own <lb/>
            satisfaction. It will be seen that we sometimes differ in opi­ <lb/>
            nion ; but as I usually distrust my own judgment in those <lb/>
            cases, the decision is submitted to the reader.</p>
          <p>I have also to express my obligations to Abraham Moore, <lb/>
            Esq., Barrister at Law, a gentleman whose taste and learning <note type="footnote"> 1 Sub-Dean and Prebendary of Westminster, and Vicar of Croydon, <lb/>
            in Surrey. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="XXXVIII"/>
            are well known to be only surpassed by his readiness to oblige: <lb/>
            of which I have the most convincing proofs ; since the hours <lb/>
            dedicated to the following sheets (which I lament that he only <lb/>
            saw in their progress through the press) were snatched from <lb/>
            avocations as urgent as they were important.</p>
          <p>Nor must I overlook the friendly assistance of William Por­ <lb/>
            den, Esq.,1 which, like that of the former gentleman, was given <lb/>
            to me, amidst the distraction of more immediate concerns, with <lb/>
            a readiness that enhanced the worth of what was, in itself, <lb/>
            highly valuable.</p>
          <p>A paper was put into my hand by Mr. George Nicol, the <lb/>
            promoter of every literary work, from R. P. Knight, Esq., <lb/>
            containing subjects for engravings illustrative of Juvenal, and, <lb/>
            with singular generosity, offering me the use of his marbles, <lb/>
            gems, &amp;c. As these did not fall within my plan, I can only <lb/>
            here return him my thanks for a kindness as extraordinary <lb/>
            as it was unexpected. But I have other and greater obliga­ <lb/>
            tions to Mr. Nicol. In conjunction with his son, Mr. William <lb/>
            Nicol, he has watched the progress of this work through the <lb/>
            press with unwearied solicitude. During my occasional ab­ <lb/>
            sences from town, the correction of it (for which, indeed, the <lb/>
            state of my eyes renders me at all times rather unfit) rested <lb/>
            almost solely on him; and it is but justice to add, that his <lb/>
            habitual accuracy in this ungrateful employ is not the only <lb/>
            quality to which I am bound to confess my obligations. <note type="footnote"> 1 The architect of Eton Hall, Cheshire, a structure which even now <lb/>

            <title type="sub">APPENDIX, ON THE DATE OF JUVENAL'S SATIRES.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THE first Satire appears, from internal evidence, to have <lb/>
            been written subsequently to at least the larger portion of the <lb/>
            other Satires. But in this, as probably in many others, lines <lb/>
            were interpolated here and there, at a period long after the <lb/>
            original composition of the main body of the Satire ; the cycle <lb/>
            of events reproducing such a combination of circumstances, <lb/>
            that the Satirist could make his shafts come home with two- <lb/>
            fold pungency. For instance, the lines 60 et seq., which pro­ <lb/>
            bably were in the first edition of the Satire directed against <lb/>
            Nero and his favourite Sporus, would tell with equal effect <lb/>
            against Hadrian and Antinous.</p>
          <p>It is impossible therefore, from any one given passage, to <lb/>
            assign a date to any of the Satires of Juvenal. All that can <lb/>
            be done, is to point out the allusion probably intended in the <note type="footnote"> d </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="L"/>
            particular passages, and by that means fix a date prior to <lb/>
            which we may reasonably conclude that portion could not <lb/>
            have been written.</p>
          <p>In those Satires whose subject is less complicated and ex­ <lb/>
            tensive, a nearer approximation may be obtained to the date <lb/>
            of the composition; as e. g. iu the case of the second and <lb/>
            eleventh Satires, and we may add the thirteenth and fifteenth.</p>
          <p>But in the first Satire, the allusions extend over so wide a <lb/>
            period, that unless we may suppose, as in the case just cited, <lb/>
            that other persons are intended under the names known to <lb/>
            history, to whom his readers would apply immediately the <lb/>
            covert sarcasm, we can hardly imagine that they could all at <lb/>
            any one given time serve to give point to the shaft of the <lb/>
            Satirist. Thus Crispinus, mentioned 1. 27, was made a senator <lb/>
            by Nero, and lived probably under Domitian also. The bar­ <lb/>
            ber alluded to in 1. 25, (if, as the commentators suppose, Cin­ <lb/>
            namus is the person,) must have lost all his wealth, and been <lb/>
            reduced to poverty, some where about A. D. 93, the date of <lb/>
            Martial’s seventh book of Epigrams (who mentions the fact, <lb/>
            and advises him to recur to his old trade, Ep. VII. lxiv.). <lb/>
            Massa and Carus (1. 35, 36) are mentioned by Martial as <lb/>
            apparently flourishing when he wrote his twelfth book, which <lb/>
            was sent to Rome A. D. 104. Again, line 49 seems to refer <lb/>
            to the condemnation of Marius as a recent event; but this <lb/>
            took place in A. D. 100. And in that same year M. Cornelius <lb/>
            Fronto was consul with Trajan ; and may have been the pro­ <lb/>
            prietor of the plane-groves, mentioned 1. 12. But then, again, <lb/>
            we hear of Julius Fronto in A. D. 129, and Hadrian's conduct <lb/>
            towards Antinous in that and the following year, might well <lb/>
            have given occasion to the 60th and following lines; and if <lb/>
            we are right in applying line 40 to Plotina’s manoeuvring to <lb/>
            secure the succession to Hadrian, it will furnish an additional <lb/>
            argument for supposing these passages to have been added <lb/>
            some time after. We may therefore offer the conjecture, that <lb/>
            the first Satire was written shortly after the year A. D. 100, <lb/>
            as a preface or introduction to the book, and that a few ad­ <lb/>
            ditions were made to it, even so late as thirty years subse­ <lb/>
            quently.</p>
          <p>The second Satire was, in all probability, the first written. <lb/>
            The allusion in the first line to the Sarmatæ, may perhaps be <lb/>
            connected with the Sarmatian war, which took place A. D. 93, <lb/>
             <pb n="LI"/>
            and in which Domitian engaged in person. And this date <lb/>
            will correspond with the other references in the Satire by <lb/>
            which an approximation to the time of its composition may be <lb/>
            obtained. In A. D. 84 Domitian received the censorship for <lb/>
            life, (1. 121,) at the same time that he was carrying on an <lb/>
            incestuous intercourse with his own niece Julia. This con­ <lb/>
            nexion was continued for some years. Shortly after the death <lb/>
            of Julia, the Vestal virgin Cornelia was buried alive, A. D. 91. <lb/>
            These are alluded to as recent events (1. 29, " nuper”). Agri­ <lb/>
            cola, too, the conqueror of Britain, died A. D. 93, (cf. 1. 160,) <lb/>
            whose campaigns are spoken of as recent occurrences, “ modo <lb/>
            captas Orcadas." The mention of Gracchus also connects this <lb/>
            with the eighth Satire, part of which at least was probably <lb/>
            written soon after the consulship of Lateranus in A. D. 94. <lb/>
            We may therefore conjecture that the Satire was composed <lb/>
            between the years A. D. 93 and 95.</p>
          <p>The third Satire may perhaps have been written in the <lb/>
            reign of Domitian, and may refer to the general departure of <lb/>
            men of worth from Rome, when Domitian expelled the phi­ <lb/>
            losophers, A. D. 90. Umbritius, who predicted the murder of <lb/>
            Galba, A. D. 69, might have been alive at that time; and, from <lb/>
            his political views, would have been a friend of Juvenal, who <lb/>
            was a bitter enemy of Otho. The nightly deeds of violence <lb/>
            perpetrated by Nero would have been still fresh in men's <lb/>
            memories (1. 278, seq.; cf. Pers. Sat. iv. 49); as would the ju­ <lb/>
            dicial murder of Barea SOl'anus, and the arrogance of Fabri­ <lb/>
            cius Veiento (1. 116, 185). Still there are other parts of the <lb/>
            Satire that seem to bear evidence of a later date. The name <lb/>
            of Isæus would hardly have been so familiar in Rome till ten <lb/>
            years after this date, 1. 74. It was not till A. D. 107 that <lb/>
            Trajan undertook the draining of the Pomptine marshes; to <lb/>
            which there is most probably an allusion in 1. 32 and 307 ; to <lb/>
            which nothing of importance had been done since the days of <lb/>
            Augustus. The great influx of foreigners into Rome, in the <lb/>
            train of Hadrian, at a still later date, A. D. 118, probably gave <lb/>
            rise to the spirited episode from 1. 58—125. (See Chronology.) <lb/>
            We may therefore consider it probable that the main body of <lb/>
            the Satire was written towards the close of the reign of Do­ <lb/>
            mitian, and received additions in the commencement of the <lb/>
            reign of Hadrian.</p>
          <p>The fourth Satire in all probability describes a real event; <note type="footnote"> d 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="LII"/>
            and would have possessed but little interest after any great <lb/>
            lapse of time, subsequent to the fact described. We may <lb/>
            therefore fairly assign it to the early part of Nerva's reign, <lb/>
            very shortly after the death of Domitian, which is mentioned <lb/>
            at the close of the Satire.</p>
          <p>The fifth Satire contains nothing by which we can de­ <lb/>
            termine the date. From Juvenal's hatred of Domitian, we <lb/>
            may suppose that 1. 36 was suggested by the condemnation of <lb/>
            Senecio, who was put to death for writing a panegyric on <lb/>
            Helvidius Priscus, A. D. 90. If the Aurelia (1. 98) be the <lb/>
            lady mentioned by Pliny, (Epist. ii. 20,) this would strengthen <lb/>
            the conjecture, as Pliny's second book of Epistles was pro­ <lb/>
            bably written very shortly before that date.</p>
          <p>There is little doubt that considerable portions of the sixth <lb/>
            Satire were written in the reign of Trajan. 1. The lines <lb/>
            407—411 describe exactly the events that took place at Anti­ <lb/>
            och, in A. D. 115, when Trajan was entering on his Armenian <lb/>
            and Parthian campaigns. 2. The coins of Trajan of the year <lb/>
            A. D. 110, have the legend Dacicus and Germanicus, cf. 1. 205 ; <lb/>
            and although Domitian triumphed over the Dacians and Ger­ <lb/>
            mans, none of his extant coins bear that inscription ; the ge­ <lb/>
            neral title being Augustus Germanicus simply. 3. Again, 1. <lb/>
            502 describes a kind of head-dress, very common on the coins <lb/>
            of the reigns of Trajan and Hadrian, representing Plotina <lb/>
            the wife of Trajan, Marciana his sister, and Sabina the wife <lb/>
            of Hadrian, and others: and this fashion was a very short-lived <lb/>
            one. Beginning with the court, it probably soon descended to <lb/>
            the ladies of inferior rank; but like its unnatural antitype, <lb/>
            the towering, powdered, and plastered rolls of our own country­ <lb/>
            women, in the degraded days of the two first Georges, it was <lb/>
            too unnatural and disfiguring to remain long in vogue with <lb/>
            that sex, to whom " tanta est quærendi cura decoris tanquam <lb/>
            famæ discrimen agatur aut animæ.” 4. The subject itself also <lb/>
            affords an additional reason for supposing that the Satire was <lb/>
            composed when the poet was advanced in life. The vices of <lb/>
            women are hardly a topic for a young writer to select: but <lb/>
            the vigorous manner in which he handles the lash, rather marks <lb/>
            the state of mind of the man who has outgrown the passions <lb/>
            of early manhood, and from "the high heaven of his philosophy ” <lb/>
            looks down with cold austerity on the desires, and with bitter <lb/>
            indignation at the vices, of those whose feelings he has long <lb/>
             <pb n="LIII"/>
            since ceased to share. Juvenal was, as Hodgson says, " an <lb/>
            impenetrable bachelor," and if, as he conjectures, he was jilted <lb/>
            in his early youth, this fact would give additional bitterness <lb/>
            to the rancour which in old age he would feel towards the sex <lb/>
            by whom his personal happiness had been embittered, as well <lb/>
            as the ruin of his native country precipitated. 5. If we are <lb/>
            right in supposing that by Heliodorus, Juvenal meant Artemi­ <lb/>
            dorus Capito, (and the change in the name is both simple and <lb/>
            readily suggested,) this would also bring down the date of this <lb/>
            Satire to Juvenal's later years, as about A. D. 122 was the <lb/>
            time when this court-physician of Hadrian had attained his <lb/>
            greatest reputation. 6. In line 320, Saufeia is spoken of in <lb/>
            similar terms to those employed in the eleventh Satire, which <lb/>
            was confessedly the work of his later years. 7. Compare also <lb/>
            the mention of Archigenes (1. 236) with the 98th line of the <lb/>
            thirteenth Satire, written A. D. 118. 8. The allusions to the <lb/>
            importation of foreigners, with their exotic vices, would also <lb/>
            refer to the same date. See Chron. A. D. 118.</p>
          <p>The date of the seventh Satire will depend mainly on the <lb/>
            question, Whom does Juvenal intend to panegyrize in his 1st <lb/>
            line ? <lb/>
            " Et spes et ratio studiorum in Cæsare tantum." <lb/>
            Gifford pronounces unhesitatingly in favour of Domitian, and <lb/>
            his argument is very plausible. “ The Satire," he says, " would <lb/>
            appear to have been written in the early part of Domitian's <lb/>
            reign ; and Juvenal, by giving the emperor ' one honest line' <lb/>
            of praise, probably meant to stimulate him to extend his pa­ <lb/>
            tronage. He did not think very ill of him at the time, and <lb/>
            augured happily for the future." Juvenal's subsequent hatred <lb/>
            of Domitian was caused, he thinks, by his bitter mortification <lb/>
            at finding, in a few years, this “ sole patron of literature " <lb/>
            changed into a ferocious and bloody persecutor of all the arts. <lb/>
            This opinion he supports by some references to contemporary <lb/>
            writers, and by the evidence of coins of Domitian existing <lb/>
            with a head of Pallas on the reverse, to symbolize his royal <lb/>
            patronage of poetry and literary pursuits. But in almost every <lb/>
            instance Gifford errs in assigning too early a date to the <lb/>
            Satires ; and one or two points in this clearly show that we <lb/>
            must bring it down to a much later period. Domitian suc­ <lb/>
            ceeded to the throne A. D. 81, and it could only have been in <lb/>
             <pb n="LIV"/>
            the earlier years of his reign that even his most servile flat­ <lb/>
            terers could have complimented him upon his patronage of <lb/>
            learning. Now, 1. It was not till about ten years after this <lb/>
            that the actor Paris acquired his influence and his wealth; <lb/>
            and even allowing the very problematical story of the banish­ <lb/>
            ment of Juvenal having been caused by the offence given to <lb/>
            the favourite by the famous lines (85—92) to be true, this <lb/>
            would bring it down to a time subsequent to the banishment <lb/>
            of philosophers from Rome ; after which act Juvenal, cer­ <lb/>
            tainly, would not have written the first line on Domitian. 2. <lb/>
            Again, in A. D. 90, Quintilian was teaching in a public school <lb/>
            at Rome, and receiving a salary from the imperial treasury ; <lb/>
            it could hardly therefore be so early as this date that he had <lb/>
            acquired the fortune and estates alluded to in 1. 189. 3. In 1. <lb/>
            82, the Thebaid of Statius is mentioned. This poem was <lb/>
            finished A. D. 94; and though it is true that Statins might, <lb/>
            most probably, have publicly recited portions of it during its <lb/>
            progress, it would have hardly earned the great reputation <lb/>
            implied in Juvenal's lines, at a sufficiently early date to allow <lb/>
            us to assign it to the first two or three years of Domitian's <lb/>
            reign.</p>
          <p>I should, therefore, rather suppose that by Cæsar we are to <lb/>
            understand Nerva. The praise of Domitian is incompatible <lb/>
            with Juvenal's universal hatred and execration of him. The <lb/>
            opening of the reign of the mild and excellent Nerva might <lb/>
            well inspire hopes of the revival of a taste for literature and <lb/>
            the arts; and I would conjecture the close of A. D. 96 as the <lb/>
            date of the Satire. Before the end of the year Statius was <lb/>
            dead; but Juvenal's words seem to imply that he was still <lb/>
            living. Again, Matho the lawyer has failed, and is in great <lb/>
            poverty, (l. 129,) to which Martial alludes in lib. xi. Ep., part <lb/>
            of which book was evidently written shortly before A. D. 97. <lb/>
            But if we are right in supposing the first Satire to have been <lb/>
            written about A. D. 100, the intervening years will have given <lb/>
            Matho ample time to retrieve his fortune by his infamous trade <lb/>
            of informing, and reappear as the luxurious character described <lb/>
            Sat. i. 32.</p>
          <p>Of the eighth Satire, if " Lateranus " be the true reading, <lb/>
            (1. 147,) or if be be intended by " Damasippus," as I believe, <lb/>
            we may assume the year A. D. 101 or 102 as the probable <lb/>
            date: Lateranus had been consul A. D. 94, and in the year <lb/>
             <pb n="LV"/>
            A. D. 101 Trajan for the first time extended the arms of Rome <lb/>
            beyond the Danube. Cf. 1. 169.</p>
          <p>The plunder of his province of Africa, by Marius Priscus, <lb/>
            was a recent event (1. 120 " nuper "); but, as we have said <lb/>
            above, he was impeached by Pliny and Tacitus in the year <lb/>
            A. D. 100. Ponticus, to whom the Satire is addressed, may <lb/>
            be the person to whom Martial refers in his twelfth book, <lb/>
            which was written A. D. 104.</p>
          <p>There are two allusions by which we may form a conjecture <lb/>
            as to the date of the ninth Satire. Crepereius Pollio is men­ <lb/>
            tioned as nearly in the same circumstances of profligate po­ <lb/>
            verty (1. 6, 7) as is described in the eleventh Satire, (1. 43,) <lb/>
            which was undoubtedly written in Juvenal's later years; and <lb/>
            he alludes (1. 117) to Saufeia, in very much the same terms in <lb/>
            which he speaks of her in the sixth Satire, (1. 320,) which we <lb/>
            suppose to have been written in his old age.</p>
          <p>The internal evidence, supplied by the sustained majesty <lb/>
            and dignified flow of language of the tenth (as well as of the <lb/>
            fourteenth) Satire, without taking into consideration the phi­ <lb/>
            losophical nature of the subject of both, is quite sufficient to <lb/>
            prove that they must have been the finished productions of a <lb/>
            late period of a thoughtful life. We are therefore quite pre­ <lb/>
            pared to admit the conjecture that the allusion in line 136 is <lb/>
            to the column of Trajan, erected in the year A. D. 113. The <lb/>
            repetition of the line (226) also connects this with the first <lb/>
            Satire, which it probably preceded only by a short interval.</p>
          <p>The 203rd line of the eleventh Satire fixes its date to the <lb/>
            later years of Juvenal's life. It breathes, besides, throughout <lb/>
            the spirit of a calm and philosophic enjoyment of the blessings <lb/>
            of life, that tells of declining age ; cheered by a chastened ap­ <lb/>
            preciation of the comforts by which it is surrounded, but far <lb/>
            removed from all extraneous or meretricious excitement, and <lb/>
            utterly abhorrent of all noisy or exuberant hilarity. An ad­ <lb/>
            ditional argument is mentioned in the Chronology for referring <lb/>
            it to the date A. D. 124.</p>
          <p>The twelfth Satire contains nothing by which we can fix <lb/>
            its date with any certainty. If, however, as the commentators <lb/>
            suppose, the wife of Fuscus, in the 45th line, be Saufeia, it <lb/>
            will be connected with the sixth, ninth, and eleventh Satires, <lb/>
            and may probably be considered the work of his advanced <lb/>
            age.</p><pb n="LVI"/>
            
          <p>The thirteenth Satire is fixed by line 17 to the year A. D. <lb/>
            118, the 60th after the consulship of L. Fonteius Capito. <lb/>
            This is the only Satire to which Mr. Clinton has assigned a <lb/>
            date.</p>
          <p>The argument applied to the tenth Satire will apply with <lb/>
            nearly equal force to the fourteenth. We are therefore prepared <lb/>
            to admit the plausibility of the conjecture, that 1. 196 refers to <lb/>
            the progress of Hadrian through Britain, which would fix the <lb/>
            date to A. D. 120; a very short time previous to the compo­ <lb/>
            sition of the following Satire.</p>
          <p>The event recorded in the fifteenth Satire occurred shortly <lb/>
            after the consulship of Junius, 1. 27, " nuper consule Junio <lb/>
            gesta." This was, in all probability, Junius Rusticus, who <lb/>
            was consul with Hadrian A. D. 119. The 110th line also <lb/>
            probably refers to the influx of Greeks and other foreigners <lb/>
            into Rome, in the train of Hadrian, (to which we have alluded <lb/>
            in discussing the date of the third Satire,) which took place in <lb/>
            the preceding year.</p>
          <p>The sixteenth Satire may have either been the draught of <lb/>
            a longer poem, commenced in early life, (as 1. 3 may imply,) <lb/>
            which the poet never cared to finish ; or an outline for a more <lb/>
            perfect composition, which he never lived to elaborate. The <lb/>
            mention of Fuscus may connect it with the twelfth Satire. <lb/>
            But though there is quite enough remaining to warrant us in <lb/>
            unhesitatingly ascribing the authorship to Juvenal, there is <lb/>
            too little left to enable us to form even a probable conjecture <lb/>
            as to the date of its composition.</p>
          <p>It is hardly necessary to add, that, after a careful examina­ <lb/>
            tion of the foregoing Chronology, it must be evident to every <lb/>
            novice in scholarship, that the whole life of Juvenal, as usually <lb/>
            given, is a mere myth, to which one cannot even apply, as in <lb/>
            many legendary biographies, the epithet of poetical.</p>

            <title type="sub">SATIRE I.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THIS Satire seems, from several incidental circumstances, to have been <lb/>
            produced subsequently to most of them; and was probably drawn up <lb/>
            after the author had determined to collect and publish his works, as a <lb/>
            kind of Introduction.</p>
          <p>He abruptly breaks silence with an impassioned complaint of the im­ <lb/>
            portunity of bad writers, and a resolution of retaliating upon them; and <lb/>
            after ridiculing their frivolous taste in the choice of their subjects, declares <lb/>
            his own intention to devote himself to Satire. After exposing the cor­ <lb/>
            ruption of men, the profligacy of women, the luxury of courtiers, the <lb/>
            baseness of informers and fortune-hunters, the treachery of guardians, and <lb/>
            the peculation of-officers of state, he censures the general passion for <lb/>
            gambling, the servile rapacity of the patricians, the avarice and gluttony <lb/>
            of the rich, and the miserable poverty and subjection of their dependents; <lb/>
            and after some bitter reflections on the danger of satirizing living villany, <lb/>
            concludes with a resolution to attack it under the mask of departed names.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">SATIRE II.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>This Satire contains an animated attack upon the hypocrisy of the phi­ <lb/>
            losophers and reformers of the day, whose ignorance, profligacy, and <lb/>
            impiety it exposes with just severity.</p>
          <p>Domitian is here the object; his vices are alluded to under every dif­ <lb/>
            ferent name ; and it gives us a high opinion of the intrepid spirit of the <lb/>
            man who could venture to circulate, even in private, so faithful a repre­ <lb/>
            sentation of that blood-thirsty tyrant.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">SATIRE III.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Umbritius, an Aruspex and friend of the author, disgusted at the pre­ <lb/>
            valence of vice and the disregard of unassuming virtue, is on the point <lb/>
            of quitting Rome; and when a little way from the city, stops short to <lb/>
            acquaint the poet, who has accompanied him, with the causes of his re­ <lb/>
            tirement. These may be arranged under the following heads :-That <lb/>
            Flattery and Vice are the only thriving arts at Rome ; in these, especially <lb/>
            the first, foreigners have a manifest superiority over the natives, and con­ <lb/>
            sequently engross all favour-that the poor are universally exposed to <lb/>
             <pb n="LVIII"/>
            scorn and insult-that the general habits of extravagance render it diffi­ <lb/>
            cult for them to subsist-that the want of a well-regulated police subjects <lb/>
            them to numberless miseries and inconveniences, aggravated by the <lb/>
            crowded state of the capital, from all which a country life is happily free <lb/>
            on the tranquillity and security of which he dilates with great beauty.</p>

            <title type="sub">SATIRE IV.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>In this Satire Juvenal indulges his honest spleen against Crispinus, <lb/>
            already noticed, and Domitian, the constant object of his scorn and ab­ <lb/>
            horrence. The introduction of the tyrant is excellent; the mock solem­ <lb/>
            nity with which the anecdote of the Turbot is introduced, the procession <lb/>
            of the affrighted counsellors to the palace, and the ridiculous debate which <lb/>
            terminates in as ridiculous a decision, show a masterly hand. The whole <lb/>
            concludes with an indignant and high-spirited apostrophe.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">SATIRE V.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Under pretence of advising one Trebius to abstain from the table of <lb/>
            Virro, a man of rank and fortune, Juvenal takes occasion to give a spirit­ <lb/>
            ed detail of the insults and mortifications to which the poor were subjected <lb/>
            by the rich, at those entertainments to which, on account of the political <lb/>
            connexion subsisting between patrons and clients, it was sometimes <lb/>
            thought necessary to invite them.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">SATIRE VI.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>The whole of this Satire, not only the longest, but the most complete of <lb/>
            the author's works, is directed against the female sex. It may be dis­ <lb/>
            tributed under the following heads :—Lust variously modified, imperious­ <lb/>
            ness of disposition, fickleness, gallantry, attachment to improper pursuits, <lb/>
            litigiousness, drunkenness, unnatural passions, fondness for singers, <lb/>
            dancers, &amp;c.; gossiping, cruelty, ill manners; outrageous pretensions to <lb/>
            criticism, grammar, and philosophy; superstitious and unbounded cre­ <lb/>
            dulity in diviners and fortune-tellers; introducing supposititious children ; <lb/>
            poisoning their step-sons to possess their fortunes ; and lastly, murdering <lb/>
            their husbands.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">SATIRE VII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>This Satire contains an animated account of the general discourage­ <lb/>
            ment under which literature laboured at Rome. Beginning with poetry, <lb/>
            it proceeds through the various departments of history, law, oratory, <lb/>
            rhetoric, and grammar; interspersing many curious anecdotes, and en­ <lb/>
            livening each different head with such satirical, humorous, and senti­ <lb/>
            mental remarks as naturally flow from the subject.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">SATIRE VIII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Juvenal demonstrates, in this Satire, that distinction is merely per­ <lb/>
            sonal ; that though we may derive rank and titles from our ancestors, <lb/>
            yet if we degenerate from the virtues by which they obtained them, we <lb/>
             <pb n="LIX"/>
            cannot be considered truly noble. This is the main object of the Satire; <lb/>
            which, however, branches out into many collateral topics-the profligacy <lb/>
            of the young nobility ; the miserable state of the provinces, which they <lb/>
            plundered and harassed without mercy; the contrast between the state <lb/>
            of debasement to which the descendants of the best families had sunk, <lb/>
            and the opposite virtues to be found in persons of the lowest station and <lb/>
            humblest descent.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">SATIRE IX.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>The Satire consists of a dialogue between the poet and one Nævolus, <lb/>
            a dependent of some wealthy debauchee, who, after making him subser­ <lb/>
            vient to his unnatural passions, in return starved, insulted, hated, and <lb/>
            discarded him. The whole object seems to be, to inculcate the grand <lb/>

          <p>The subject of this inimitable Satire is the vanity of human wishes. <lb/>
            From the principal events of the lives of the most illustrious characters <lb/>
            of all ages, the poet shows how little happiness is promoted by the attain­ <lb/>
            ment of what our indistinct and limited views represent as the greatest <lb/>
            of earthly blessings. Of these he instances wealth, power, eloquence, <lb/>
            military glory, longevity, and personal accomplishments; all of which, <lb/>
            he shows, have proved dangerous or destructive to their respective pos­ <lb/>
            sessors. Hence he argues the wisdom of acquiescing in the dispensations <lb/>
            of Heaven ; and concludes with a form of prayer, in which he points out <lb/>
            with great force and beauty the objects for which a rational being may <lb/>
            presume to approach the Almighty.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>Under the form of an invitation to his friend Persicus, Juvenal takes <lb/>
            occasion to enunciate many admirable maxims for the due regulation of <lb/>
            life. After ridiculing the miserable state to which a profligate patrician <lb/>
            had reduced himself by his extravagance, he introduces the picture of his <lb/>
            own domestic economy, which he follows by a pleasing view of the sim­ <lb/>
            plicity of ancient manners, artfully contrasted with the extravagance and <lb/>
            luxury of the current times. After describing with great beauty the en­ <lb/>
            tertainment he proposes to give his friend, he concludes with an earnest <lb/>
            recommendation to him to enjoy the present with content, and await the <lb/>
            future with calmness and moderation.</p>

          <p>Catullus, a valued friend of the poet, had narrowly escaped shipwreck. <lb/>
            In a letter of rejoicing to their common friend, Corvinus, Juvenal de­ <lb/>
            scribes the danger that his friend had incurred, and his own hearty and <lb/>
            disinterested delight at his preservation, contrasting his own sacrifices of <lb/>
            thanksgiving at the event, with those offered by the designing legacy- <lb/>
            hunters, by which the rich and childless were attempted to be insnared.</p><pb n="LX"/>

          <p>Calvinus had left a sum of money in the hands of a confidential per­ <lb/>
            son, who, when he came to re-demand it, forswore the deposit. The in­ <lb/>
            dig'nation and fury expressed by Calvinus at this breach of trust, reached <lb/>
            the ears of his friend Juvenal, who endeavours to soothe and comfort him <lb/>
            under his loss. The different topics of consolation follow one another <lb/>
            naturally and forcibly, and the horrors of a troubled conscience were per­ <lb/>
            haps never depicted with such impressive solemnity as in this Satire.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">SATIRE XIV.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>The whole of this Satire is directed to the one great end of self-im­ <lb/>
            provement. By showing the dreadful facility with which children copy <lb/>
            the vices of their parents, the poet points out the necessity as well as the <lb/>
            sacred duty of giving them examples of domestic purity and virtue. <lb/>
            After briefly enumerating the several vices, gluttony, cruelty, debauchery, <lb/>
            &amp;c., which youth imperceptibly imbibe from their seniors, he enters more <lb/>
            at large into that of avarice; of which he shows the fatal and inevitable <lb/>
            consequences. Nothing can surpass the exquisiteness of this division of <lb/>
            the Satire, in which he traces the progress of that passion in the youthful <lb/>
            mind from the paltry tricks of saving a broken meal to the daring violation <lb/>
            of every principle, human and divine. Having placed the absurdity as <lb/>
            well as the danger of immoderate desires in every point of view, he con­ <lb/>
            cludes with a solemn admonition to rest satisfied with those comforts and <lb/>
            conveniences which nature and wisdom require, and which a decent <lb/>
            competence is easily calculated to supply.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>After enumerating with great humour the animal and vegetable gods <lb/>
            of the Egyptians, the author directs his powerful ridicule at their sottish <lb/>
            and ferocious bigotry; of which he gives an atrocious and loathsome <lb/>
            example. The conclusion of the Satire, which is a just and beautiful <lb/>
            description of the origin of civil society, (infinitely superior to any thing <lb/>
            that Lucretius or Horace has delivered on the subject,) founded not on <lb/>
            natural instinct, but on principles of mutual benevolence implanted by <lb/>
            God in the breast of man, and of man alone, does honour to the genius, <lb/>
            good sense, and enlightened morality of the author.</p>

          <p>Under a pretence of pointing out to his friend Gallus the advantages <lb/>
            of a military life, Juvenal attacks with considerable spirit the exclusive <lb/>
            privileges which the army had acquired or usurped, to the manifest injury <lb/>

          <p>I LONG to escape from hence beyond the Sarmatians, and <lb/>
            the frozen sea, whenever those fellows who pretend to be <lb/>
            Curii and live like Bacchanals presume to read a lecture on <lb/>
            morality. First of all, they are utterly unlearned, though <lb/>
            you may find all their quarters full of busts of Chrysippus. <lb/>
            For the most finished scholar among them is he that has <lb/>
            bought an image of Aristotle or Pittacus, or bids his shelves <lb/>
            retain originals of Cleanthes. There is no trusting to the <lb/>
            outside ! For what street is there that does not overflow with <lb/>
            debauchees of demure exterior ? Dost thou reprove abomina­ <lb/>
            tions, that art thyself the most notorious sink among catamites <lb/>
            who pretend to follow Socrates ? Thy rough limbs indeed, <lb/>
            and the stiff bristles on thy arms, seem to promise a vigorous <lb/>
            mind within; but on thy smooth behind, the surgeon with a <lb/>
            smile lances the swelling piles. These fellows affect a pau­ <lb/>
            city of words, and a wonderful taciturnity, and the fashion of <lb/>
            cutting their hair shorter than their eye-brows. There is <lb/>
            therefore more frankness and sincerity in Peribomius ; the <lb/>
            man that by his very look and gait makes no secret of his de­ <lb/>
            pravity, I look upon as the victim of destiny. The plain- <lb/>
            dealing of the latter class excites our pity; their very mad­ <lb/>
            ness pleads for our forgiveness. Far worse are they who in <lb/>
            Hercules' vein practise similar atrocities, and preaching up <lb/>
            virtue, perpetrate the foulest vice. " Shall I feel any dread <lb/>
            for thee, Sextus, unnatural thyself?" says the infamous <lb/>
            Varillus. " How am I worse than thou ? Let the straight­ <lb/>
            limbed, if you please, mock the bandy-legged ; the fair European <lb/>
            sneer at the Ethiop. But who could tolerate the Gracchi if <lb/>
            they railed at sedition ? Who would not confound heaven with <lb/>
            earth, and sea with sky, 1 if a thief were odious to Verres, or a <lb/>

            Catiline Cethegus ? If Sylla's three pupils were to declaim <lb/>

          <p>Lauronia could not endure some fierce reformer of this class <lb/>
            so often exclaiming, "Where is now the Julian law? is it <lb/>
            slumbering? ” and thus silenced him with a sneer: "Blest <lb/>
            days indeed ! that set thee up as a censor of morals ! Rome <lb/>

            buy these perfumes that exhale from your neck, all hairy <lb/>
            though it be ! Do not be ashamed to tell the shopman's name. <lb/>
            But if old laws and statutes are to be raked up,2 before all <lb/>
            others the Scatinian ought to be revived. First scrutinize <lb/>

            not find one single instance of such execrable conduct in our <lb/>
            sex.3 Tædia does not caress Cluvia, nor Flora Catulla. <lb/>
            Hispo acts both sex's parts, and is pale with two-handed lust. <lb/>
            Do ue ever plead causes? Do we study civil law? or dis­ <lb/>
            turb your courts with any clamour of our tongues ? A few of <lb/>
            us perhaps may wrestle, or diet themselves on the trainer's <lb/>
            food; but only a few. You men, you spin wool, and carry <lb/>
            home in women's baskets your finished tasks. You men twist <lb/>

            draw, profane females !" is the cry. No minstrel here may <lb/>
            make her cornet sound ! Such were the orgies by the secret <lb/>
            torch-light which the Baptæ celebrated, who used to weary <lb/>
            out even the Athenian Cotytto.1 One with needle held <lb/>
            oblique adds length to his eyebrows touched with moistened <lb/>
            soot, and raising the lids paints his quivering eyes. Another <lb/>
            drains a Priapus-shaped glass, and confines his long thick <lb/>
            hair with a caul of gold thread, clothed in sky-blue checks, or <lb/>
            close-piled yellow stuffs; while his attendant also swears by <lb/>
            Juno, the patron deity of his master. Another holds a <lb/>
            mirror, the weapon wielded by the pathic Otho, “ the spoil of <lb/>
            Auruncan Actor,"2 in which he surveyed himself when fully <lb/>
            armed, before he gave the signal to engage,-a thing worthy to <lb/>
            be recorded in the latest annals and history of the day. A <lb/>
            mirror ! fit baggage for a civil war ! 0 yes, forsooth ! to kill <lb/>
            old Galba shows the consummate general, to pamper one's <lb/>
            complexion is the consistent occupation of the first citizen of <lb/>
            Rome; to aspire to the empire as the prize on Bebriacum's 3 <lb/>
            plains, and then spread over his face a poultice applied with <lb/>
            his fingers ! Such an act as neither the quivered Semiramis <lb/>
            perpetrated in the Assyrian realms, or Cleopatra flying de­ <lb/>
            jected in her Actian galley. Among this crew there is <lb/>
            neither decency of language, nor respect for the proprieties of <lb/>
            the table. Here is the foul licence that Cybele enjoins, the <lb/>
            lisping speech, the aged priest with hoary hair, like one pos­ <lb/>
            sessed, a prodigy of boundless appetite, open to hire. Yet <lb/>
            why do they delay ? since long ago they ought after the <lb/>
            Phrygian custom to have removed with their knives the <lb/>
            superfluous flesh.</p>
          <p>Gracchus4 gave four hundred sestertia as his dowry, with <lb/>

            You would without doubt be horrified, and deem it a prodigy <lb/>
            of portentous import, if a woman gave birth to a calf, or a <lb/>
            cow to a lamb. The same Gracchus puts on flounces, the <lb/>

            such heinous guilt to the shepherds of Latium ? Whence, a <lb/>
            Gradivus, came this unnatural lust that has tainted thy race ? <lb/>
            See ! a man illustrious in birth and rank is made over to a <lb/>
            man! Dost thou neither shake thy helmet, nor smite the <lb/>
            earth with thy lance ? Dost thou not even appeal to thy <lb/>
            father Jove ? Begone then ! and quit the acres of the Campus <lb/>
            once so severe, which thou ceasest to care for ! “ I have some <lb/>
            duty-work to perform to-morrow at break of day in the <lb/>
            Quirinal valley." " What is the occasion ?" " Why ask ? my <lb/>
            friend is going to be married; only a few are invited !" If <lb/>
            we only live to see it, these things will be done in the broad <lb/>
            light of day, and claim to be registered in the public acts. <lb/>
            Meanwhile, there is one grievous source of pain that clings to <lb/>
            these male-brides, that they are incapable of bearing, and re­ <lb/>
            taining their lords' affections by bringing them children. <lb/>
            No ! better is it that nature in this case gives their minds no <lb/>
            power over their bodies ! They must die barren ! Vain, in <lb/>
            their case, is fat Lyde with her medicated box ; vain the hold­ <lb/>
            ing out their hands to the nimble Luperci.</p>
          <p>Yet even this prodigy of crime is surpassed by the trident <lb/>
            of Gracchus in his gladiator's tunica when in full flight he <lb/>
            traverses the middle of the arena. Gracchus ! more nobly <lb/>
            born than the Manlii, and Marcelli, and Catulus' and Paulus' <lb/>
            race, and the Fabii, and all the spectators in the front row. <lb/>

            cut off at Cremera, and the flower of Roman youth slaughtered <lb/>

          <p>To such a pitch of degradation are we come !2 We have, <lb/>
            indeed, advanced our arms beyond Juvertia's shore, and the <lb/>
            Orcades3 recently subdued, and the Britons content with <lb/>
            night contracted to its briefest span. But those abominations <lb/>
            which are committed in the victorious people's city are un­ <lb/>
            known to those barbarians whom we have conquered.]“ Yet <lb/>
            there is a story told of one, an Armenian Zalates, who, more <lb/>
            effeminate than the rest of his young countrymen, is reported <lb/>
            to have yielded to the tribune's lust." See the result of in­ <lb/>

          <p>ALTHOUGH troubled at the departure of my old friend, yet I <lb/>
            cannot but commend his intention of fixing his abode at <lb/>
            Cumæ, now desolate, and giving the Sibyl one citizen at least. <lb/>
            It is the high road to Baiæ, and has a pleasant shore ; a de­ <lb/>
            lightful retreat.- I prefer even Prochyta1 to the Suburra. <lb/>
            For what have we ever looked on so wretched or so lonely, <lb/>
            that you would not deem it worse to be in constant dread of <lb/>
            fires, the perpetual falling-in of houses, and the thousand <lb/>
            dangers of the cruel city,2 andpoets spouting in the month of <lb/>
            August.3 But while his whole household is being stowed in a <lb/>
            single waggon, my friend Umbritius halted at the ancient tri­ <lb/>
            umphal arches 4 and the moist Capena. Here, where Numa used <lb/>
            to make assignations with his nocturnal mistress, the grove of <lb/>

            they are believed. Can he be reckoned a better actor,1 when <lb/>
            he takes the part of Thais, or acts the wife in the play, or <lb/>
            Doris 2 without her robe. It is surely a woman in reality that <lb/>
            seems to speak, and not a man personifying one. LYou would <lb/>
            swear it was a woman, perfect in all respects. In their coun­ <lb/>
            try, neither Antiochus, nor Stratocles, or Demetrius and the <lb/>
            effeminate Hæmus, would call forth admiration. For there <lb/>
            every man's an actor. Do you smile ? He is convulsed with <lb/>
            a laugh far more hearty. If he spies a tear in his friend's <lb/>
            eye, he bursts into a flood of weeping ; though in reality he <lb/>
            feels no grief. If at the winter solstice you ask for a little <lb/>
            fire, he calls for his thick coat. If you say, I am hot! he <lb/>
            breaks into a sweat. Therefore we are not fairly matched; <lb/>
            he has the best of it, who can at any time, either by night or <lb/>
            day, assume a fictitious face; kiss his hands in ecstasy, quite <lb/>
            ready to praise his patron's grossest acts; if the golden cup <lb/>
            has emitted a sound, when its bottom is inverted.</p>
          <p>Besides, there is nothing that is held sacred by these fel­ <lb/>
            lows, or that is safe from their lust. Neither the mistress of <lb/>
            the house, nor your virgin daughter, nor her suitor, unbearded <lb/>
            as yet, nor your son, heretofore chaste. If none of these are <lb/>
            to be found, he assails his friend's grandmother. They aim <lb/>
            at learning the secrets of the house, and from that knowledge <lb/>
            be feared,</p>
          <p>And since we have begun to make mention of the Greeks, <lb/>
            pass on to their schools of philosophy, and hear the foul crime <lb/>
            of the more dignified cloak.3 It was a Stoic that killed <lb/>
            Bareas—the informer, his personal friend-the old man, his <lb/>
            own pupil-bred on that shore4 on which the pinion of the <lb/>
            Gorgonean horse lighted. There is no room for any Roman <lb/>
            here, where some Protogenes, or Diphilus, or Erimanthus <note type="footnote"> 1 His powers of flattery show his ability of assuming a fictitious cha­ <lb/>

            never shares a friend, but engrosses him entirely to himself. <lb/>

            ejected from the door; all my long-protracted -service goes <lb/>
            for nought. No where is the loss of a client of less account. <lb/>
            Besides (not to flatter ourselves) what service can the poor <lb/>
            man render, what merit can he plead, even though he be <lb/>
            zealous enough to hasten in his toga1 before break of day, <lb/>
            when the very prætor himself urges on his lictor, and bids <lb/>

            other with a hard pole ;1 one knocks a beam against my head, „ <lb/>
            another a ten-gallon cask. My legs are coated thick with <lb/>
            mud; then, anon, I am trampled upon by great heels all <lb/>
            round me, and the hob-nail of the soldier's caliga remains <lb/>
            imprinted on my toe.</p>
          <p>Do you not see with what a smoke the sportula is fre­ <lb/>
            quented ? A hundred guests ! and each followed by his port­ <lb/>
            able kitchen.2 Even Corbulo3 himself could scarcely carry <lb/>
            such a number of huge vessels, so many things piled upon his <lb/>
            head, which, without bending his neck, the wretched little <lb/>
            slave supports, and keeps fanning his fire as he runs along.4</p>
          <p>Tunics that have been patched together are torn asunder <lb/>
            again. Presently, as the tug approaches, the long fir-tree <lb/>
            quivers,- other waggons are conveying pine-trees ; they totter <lb/>
            from their height, and threaten ruin to the crowd. For if <lb/>
            that wain, that is transporting blocks of Ligustican stone, is <lb/>
            upset, and pours its mountain-load upon the masses below, <lb/>
            what is there left of their bodies ? Who can find their limbs <lb/>
            or bones ? Every single carcass of the mob is crushed to; <lb/>
            minute atoms as impalpable as their souls. While, all this <lb/>
            while, the family at home, in happy ignorance of their mas­ <lb/>
            ter's fate, are washing up the dishes, and blowing up the fire <lb/>
            with their mouths, and making a clatter with the well-oiled <lb/>
            strigils, and arranging the bathing towels with the full oil­ <lb/>

            slaves. But the master himself is at this moment seated5 on <lb/>
            the banks of Styx, and, being a novice, is horrified at the <lb/>
            grim ferry-man, and dares not hope for the boat to cross the <lb/>

            unforeseen accident, if you go out to supper without having <lb/>
            made your will. It is clear that there are just so many chances <lb/>
            of death, as there are open windows where the inmates are <lb/>
            awake inside, as you pass by. Pray, therefore, and bear <lb/>

            from his years, and flushed with unmixed wine, he cautiously <lb/>
            avoids him whom a scarlet cloak, and a very long train of <lb/>
            attendants, with plenty of flambeaux and a bronzed candela­ <lb/>
            brum, warns him to steer clear of. As for me, whose only <lb/>

          <p>ONCE more behold Crispinus! 1 and often shall I have to <lb/>
            call him on the stage. A monster! without one virtue to <lb/>
            redeem his vices-of feeble powers, save only in his lust. It <lb/>
            is only a widow's charms this adulterer scorns.</p>
          <p>What matters it then in what large porticoes he wearies <lb/>
            out his steeds-through what vast shady groves his rides <lb/>
            extend2—how many acres close to the forum, or what palaces <lb/>
            he has bought ? No bad man is ever happy. Least of all he <lb/>
            that has added incest to his adultery, and lately seduced the <lb/>
            filleted priestess,3 that with her life-blood still warm must <lb/>
            descend into the earth.</p>
          <p>But now we have to deal with more venial acts. Yet if <lb/>
            any other man had committed the same, he would have come <lb/>
            under the sentence of our imperial censor.4 For what would <lb/>
            be infamous in men of worth, a Titius or Seius, was becoming <lb/>
            to Crispinus. What can you do when no crime can be so <lb/>
            foul and loathsome as the perpetrator himself? He gave six <lb/>
            sestertia for a mullet.5 A thousand sesterces, forsooth ! for <lb/>
            every pound of weight, as they allege, who exaggerate stories <lb/>
            already beyond belief. I should commend the act as a master- <lb/>
            stroke of policy, if by so noble a present he had got himself <lb/>
            named chief heir6 in the will of some childless old man. A <lb/>
            better plea still would be that he had sent it to some mistress <lb/>
            of rank, that rides in her close chair with its wide glasses. <lb/>
            Nothing of the sort! He bought it for himself! We see <lb/>
            many things which even Apicius7 (mean and thrifty com­ <lb/>
            pared with him) never was guilty of. Did you do this in <note type="footnote"> 1 Iterum.

            truth: and so it was that he saw many winters and eighty <lb/>
            summers; safe, by such weapons, even in a court like that. <lb/>
            Next to him hurried Acilius, a man of the same time of life ; <lb/>
            with a youth2 that ill deserved so cruel a death as that which <lb/>
            awaited him, so prematurely inflicted by the tyrant's swords ; <lb/>
            but nobility coupled with old age, has long since been a <lb/>
            miracle. Consequently, for myself, I should prefer being a <lb/>
            younger brother of the giants.3 It was of no avail therefore <lb/>
            to the wretched man, that as a naked huntsman in the amphi­ <lb/>
            theatre of Alba, he fought hand to hand with Numidian <lb/>
            bears. For who, in our days, is not up to the artifices of the <lb/>
            patricians ? Who would now admire that primitive cunning <lb/>
            of thine, Brutus ? It is an easy thing to impose on a king that <lb/>
            wears a beard!4 Then came Rubrius not a whit less pale, <lb/>
            though he was no noble, one accused of an ancient and name­ <lb/>
            less crime, and yet more lost to shame than the pathic satir­ <lb/>
            ist.5 There too is to be seen Montanus' paunch, unwieldy <lb/>
            from its size, and Crispus reeking with unguent though so early <lb/>
            in the day, more than enough to furnish forth two funerals; <note type="footnote"> 1 Vibius Crispus Placentinus, the author of the witticism about <lb/>

            and Pompeius, still more ruthless even than he at cutting <lb/>
            men's throats by his insinuating whisper; and he that kept <lb/>
            his entrails only to fatten the Dacian vultures, Fuscus, that <lb/>
            studied the art of war in his marble palace ; and the shrewd <lb/>
            Veiento with the deadly Catullus,l who raged with lust for a <lb/>
            girl he could not see, a monster and prodigy of guilt even in <lb/>
            our days, the blind flatterer, a common bridge-beggar2 invested <lb/>
            with this hateful power, whose worthiest fate would be to run <lb/>
            begging by the carriages on the road to Aricia, and blow his <lb/>
            fawning kisses to the chariot as it descends the hill. No one <lb/>
            showed more'astonishment at the turbot, for he was profuse <lb/>
            in his wonder, turning towards the left, but unfortunately the <lb/>
            fish lay on the other side. This was just the way he used to <lb/>
            praise the combat and fencing of the Cilician gladiator, and <lb/>
            the stage machinery, and the boys caught up by it to the <lb/>
            awning. Veiento is not to be outdone by him; but, like one <lb/>
            inspired by the maddening influence of Bellona, begins to di­ <lb/>
            vine. "A mighty omen this yon have received of some great <lb/>
            and noble triumph. Some captive king you'll take, or Arvi­ <lb/>
            ragus will be hurled from his British car. For the monster is <lb/>
            a foreign one. Do you see the sharp fins bristling on his <lb/>
            back like spears?" In one point only Fabricius was at fault, <lb/>
            he could not tell the turbot's country or age. “ What then is <lb/>
            your opinion ? Is it to be cut up?" "Heaven forefend so <lb/>
            great dishonour to the noble fish !” says Montanus. " Let a <lb/>
            deep dish be provided, whose thin sides may enclose its huge <lb/>

            imperial court, and Nero's nights,3 and a second appetite when <lb/>

            your friendship with the great man is-a meal! This your <lb/>
            patron sets down to your account, and, rare though it be, still <lb/>
            takes it into the calculation. Therefore, if after the lapse of <lb/>
            two months he deigns to send for his long-neglected client, <lb/>
            only that the third place may not be unoccupied in one couch <lb/>
            of his triclinium1—“ Let us sup together," he says ; the very <lb/>

          <p>But what sort of a supper is it after all ? Wine, such as <lb/>
            wool just shorn would not imbibe.3 You will see the guests <lb/>
            become frantic as the priests of Cybele. Wranglings are the <lb/>
            prelude of the fray: but soon you begin to hurl cups as well <lb/>
            in retaliation; and wipe your wounds with your napkin <lb/>
            stained with blood; as often as a pitched battle, begun with <lb/>
            pitchers of Saguntine ware, rages between you and the <lb/>
            regiment of freedmen. The great man himself drinks wine <lb/>
            racked from the wood under some consul with long hair,4 and <lb/>
            sips5 the juice of the grape pressed in the Social war; never <lb/>

            sick at heart. To-morrow, he will drink the produce of the <lb/>

            the gems and watch your sharp nails. Forgive the precau­ <lb/>
            tion : the jasper so much admired there is indeed a noble one : <lb/>
            for, like many others, Virro transfers to his cups the gems <lb/>
            from off his fingers, which the youth, preferred to the jealous <lb/>
            Hiarbas,2 used to set on the front of his scabbard. You will <lb/>

            sents as used to be sent by Seneca to his friends of humble <lb/>
            station, or the munificent gifts which the bountiful Piso or <lb/>
            Cotta used to dispense ; for in days of old the glory of giving <lb/>
            was esteemed a higher honour than fasces or inscriptions. <lb/>
            All we ask is that you would treat us at supper like fellow- <lb/>

            Virro will order to be served to himself and his brother Virros <lb/>
            such noble apples, on whose fragrance alone you are allowed <lb/>
            to revel ; such as the eternal autumn of the Phæacians pro­ <lb/>

          <p>I BELIEVE that while Saturn still was king, chastity lingered <lb/>
            upon earth, and was long seen there: when a chill cavern <lb/>
            furnished a scanty dwelling, and enclosed in one common <lb/>
            shade the fire and household gods, the cattle, and their <lb/>
            owners. When a wife, bred on the mountains, prepared a <lb/>
            rustic bed with leaves and straw and the skins of the wild <lb/>
            beasts their neighbours; not like thee, Cynthia,1—or thee <lb/>
            whose beaming eyes the death of a sparrow dimmed with <lb/>
            tears,-but bearing breasts from which her huge infants might <lb/>
            drink, not suck, and often more uncivilized even than her <lb/>
            acorn-belching husband. Since men lived very differently <lb/>
            then, when the world was new, and the sky but freshly <lb/>
            created, who, born from the riven oak, or moulded out of clay, <lb/>
            had no parents.</p>
          <p>Many traces of primæval chastity, perhaps, or some few at <lb/>
            least, may have existed, even under Jove ; but then it was be­ <lb/>
            fore Jove's beard was grown; before the Greeks were yet <lb/>
            ready to swear by another's head ; when no one feared a thief <lb/>
            for his cabbages or apples, but lived with garden unenclosed. <lb/>
            Then by degrees Astræa retired to the realms above, with <lb/>
            chastity for her companion, and the two sisters fled together.</p>
          <p>To violate the marriage-bed, and laugh to scorn the genius <lb/>
            that presides over the nuptial couch, is an ancient and a hack­ <lb/>
            neyed vice, Postumus. Every other species of iniquity the <lb/>
            age of iron soon produced. The silver age witnessed the first <lb/>
            adulterers.</p>
          <p>And yet are you preparing your marriage covenant, and <lb/>
            the settlement,2 and betrothal, in our days, and are already <lb/>

            notorious of adulterers, whom the chest of Latinus in peril of <lb/>
            his life has so often concealed, is now going to insert his idiot <lb/>
            head in the nuptial halter ; nay, and more than this, is looking <lb/>
            out for a wife possessed of the virtues of ancient days ! Haste, <lb/>
            physicians, bore through the middle vein ! What a nice man ! <lb/>
            Fall prostrate at the threshold of Tarpeian Jove, and sacri­ <lb/>
            fice to Juno a heifer with gilded horns, if you have the rare <lb/>
            good fortune to find a matron with unsullied chastity. So few <lb/>
            are there worthy to handle the fillets of Ceres ; so few, whose <lb/>
            kisses their own fathers might not dread. Wreathe chaplets <lb/>
            for the door-posts, stretch thick clusters of ivy over the <lb/>
            threshold. Is one husband enough for Iberina ? Sooner <lb/>
            will you prevail on her to be content with one eye. " Yet <lb/>

            country, or even at Fidenæ, and I grant what you say of <lb/>
            the influence of the paternal country-seat. Yet who will <lb/>

            public shows hold one that you could love without mis­ <lb/>
            givings ; or one you could pick out from the rest ? While the <lb/>

            the theatres are closed and empty, and the Megalesian games <lb/>

          <p>Hippia, though wife to a senator, accompanied a gladiator to <lb/>
            Pharos and the Nile, and the infamous walls of Lagos.2 Even <lb/>
            Canopus itself reprobated the immorality of the imperial city. <lb/>
            She, forgetful of her home, her husband, and her sister, showed <lb/>
            no concern for her native land, or, vile wretch as she was, her <lb/>
            weeping children, and, to amaze you even more, quitted the <lb/>
            shows and Paris. But though when a babe she had been pil­ <lb/>
            lowed in great luxury, in the down of her father's mansion, <lb/>
            and a cradle of richest workmanship, she despised the perils <lb/>

            coward hearts are chilled with icy fear-they cannot support <lb/>
            themselves on their trembling feet. They show a dauntless <lb/>
            spirit in those things which they basely dare. If it is their <lb/>
            husband that bids them, it is a great hardship to go on board <lb/>
            ship. Then the bilgewater is insufferable ! the skies spin <lb/>
            round them ! She that follows her adulterer, has no qualms. <lb/>
            The one is sick all over her husband. The other dines among <lb/>
            the sailors and walks the quarter-deck, and delights in hand­ <lb/>
            ling the hard ropes. And yet what was the beauty that in­ <lb/>
            flamed, what the prime of life that captivated Hippia ? What <lb/>
            was it she saw in him to compensate her for being nicknamed <lb/>
            the fencer's whore ? For the darling Sergius had now begun <lb/>
            to shave his throat; and badly wounded in the arm to anti­ <lb/>
            cipate his discharge. Besides, he had many things to dis­ <lb/>
            figure his face, as for instance-he was galled with his helmet, <lb/>
            and had a huge wen between his nostrils, and acrid rheum for <lb/>
            ever trickling from his eye. But then he was a gladiator ! It <lb/>
            is this that makes them beautiful as Hyacinthus ! It was this <lb/>
            she preferred to her children and her native land, her sister <lb/>
            and her husband. It is the steel they are enamoured of. This <lb/>
            very same Sergius, if discharged from the arena, would begin <lb/>
            to be Veiento in her eyes.</p>
          <p>Do you feel an interest in a private house, in a Hippia's <lb/>
            acts ? Turn your eyes to the rivals of the gods ! Hear what <lb/>
            Claudius had to endure. As soon as his wife perceived he <lb/>
            was asleep, this imperial harlot, that dared prefer a coarse <lb/>
            mattress to the royal bed, took her hood she wore by nights, <lb/>
            quitted the palace with but a single attendant, but with a <lb/>
            yellow tire concealing her black hair ; entered the brothel <lb/>
            warm with the old patch-work quilt, and the cell vacant and <lb/>
            appropriated to herself. Then took her stand with naked <lb/>
            breasts and gilded nipples, <unclear>assumi</unclear> the name of Lycisca, and <lb/>
            displayed the person of the mother of the princely Britannicus, <lb/>
            received all comers with caresses and asked her compliment, <lb/>
            and submitted to often-repeated embraces. Then when the <lb/>
            owner dismissed his denizens, sadly she took her leave, and <lb/>
            (all she could do) lingered to the last before she closed her <lb/>
            cell; and still raging with unsatisfied desire, tired with the <lb/>
            toil but yet unsated, she retired with sullied cheeks defiled, <lb/>
            and, foul from the smoke of lamps, bore back the odour of the <lb/>

          <p>Shall I speak of the love-philters, the incantations, the <lb/>

            acts which they commit, to which they are impelled by the <lb/>
            imperative suggestions of their sex, are still more atrocious: <lb/>
            those they commit through lust are the least of their crimes. <lb/>
            “ Then, how can it be that even by her husband's showing <lb/>
            Cesennia is the best of wives ? " She brought him a thousand <lb/>

            not with Venus' quiver that he grows thin, or with her torch <lb/>
            he burns; it is from that his fires are fed ; from her dowry <lb/>
            that the arrows emanate. She has purchased her liberty: <lb/>
            therefore, even in her husband's presence, she may exchange <lb/>
            signals, and answer her love-letters. A rich wife, with a <lb/>

            that seems to you a worthy match ?" Let her be beautiful, <lb/>
            graceful, rich, fruitful; marshal along her porticoes her rows <lb/>
            of ancestral statues; let her be more chaste than any single <lb/>
            Sabine that, with hair dishevelled, brought the war to a close ; <lb/>
            be a very phoenix upon earth, rare as a black swan ; who <lb/>
            could tolerate a wife in whom all excellencies are concen­ <lb/>
            trated ! I would rather, far rather, have a country maiden <lb/>
            from Venusia, than you, O Cornelia, mother of the Gracchi, if <lb/>
            along with your exalted virtues you bring as portion of your <lb/>
            dower a haughty and disdainful brow, and reckon as part of <lb/>
            your fortune the triumphs of your house ! Away, I be,, with <lb/>
            your Hannibal and Syphax conquered in his camp, and tramp <lb/>

            than the white sow. What dignity of deportment, what <lb/>
            beauty, can compensate for your wife's always throwing her <lb/>
            own worth in your teeth ? For all the satisfaction of this <lb/>
            rare and chief good is destroyed, if, entirely spoilt by haughti­ <lb/>

            praises to the skies, and hate her seven hours out of every <lb/>
            twelve ? There are some things, trifling indeed, and yet such <lb/>
            as no husband can tolerate. For what can be more sickening <lb/>
            than the fact that no one woman considers herself beautiful, <lb/>
            unless instead of Tuscan she has become a little Greek-meta­ <lb/>

            Every thing is in Greek. (While surely it is more disgrace­ <lb/>
            ful for our countrywomen not to know their mother tongue.) <lb/>
            In this language they give vent to their fears, their anger, <lb/>
            their joys and cares, and all the inmost workings of their soul. <lb/>
            Nay more, they kiss a la Grecque ! This in young girls you <lb/>
            may excuse. But must thou, forsooth, speak Greek, that hast <lb/>
            had the wear and tear of six and eighty years ? In an old <lb/>
            woman this language becomes immodest, when interspersed <lb/>
            with the wanton <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ζωὴ καὶ ψυχή</foreign>. You are employing in pub­ <lb/>

            these enticing and wanton words ? It has all the force of <lb/>
            actual touching. Yet though you pronounce them all in more <lb/>
            insinuating tones than even Hæmus or Carpophorus, your <lb/>
            face, the tell-tale of your years, makes all the feathers droop.</p>
          <p>If you are not likely to love her that is contracted and <lb/>
            united to you in lawful wedlock, there seems no single reason <lb/>
            why you should marry, nor why you should waste the wed­ <lb/>
            ding dinner and bride cakes1 which you must dispense, when <lb/>
            their complimentary attendance is over, to your bridal guests <lb/>

            nuptial night, when, in the well-stored dish, Dacicus2 and <lb/>
            Germanicus glitters with its golden legend. If you are pos­ <lb/>
            sessed of such simplicity of character as to be enamoured <lb/>
            of your wife, and your whole soul is devoted to her alone, <lb/>
            then bow your head with neck prepared to bear the yoke. <lb/>
            You will find none that will spare a man that loves her. <lb/>
            Though she be enamoured herself, she delights in tormenting <lb/>
            and fleecing her lover. Consequently a wife is far more dis­ <lb/>
            astrous to him that is likely to prove a kind and eligible husband. <lb/>
            You will never be allowed to make a present without your <lb/>
            wife's consent. If she opposes it, you must not sell a single <lb/>
            thing, or buy one, against her will. She will give away your <note type="footnote"> ' Mustacea, (the Greek <foreign xml:lang="grc">σησαμη̃</foreign>. Arist. Pax. 869,) a mixture of meal <lb/>

            wills, and even gladiators enjoy the same amount of privilege, <lb/>

            bridal veil. Then she flies back, and seeks again the traces <lb/>
            of the bed she scorned.2 She leaves the doors so recently <lb/>
            adorned, the tapestry still hanging on the house, and the <lb/>
            branches still green upon the threshold. Thus the number <lb/>
            grows : thus she has her eight3 husbands in five years. A <lb/>
            notable fact to record upon her tomb !,</p>
          <p>All chance of domestic happiness is hopeless while your <lb/>
            wife's mother is alive. She bids her exult in despoiling her <lb/>
            husband to the utmost. She teaches her how to write back <lb/>
            nothing savouring of discourtesy or inexperience to the mis­ <lb/>
            sives of the seducer. She either baulks or bribes your spies ; <lb/>
            then, though your daughter is in rude health, calls in Archi­ <lb/>
            genes, and tosses off the bed-clothes as too oppressive. Mean­ <lb/>
            while the adulterer, concealed apart, stands trembling with <lb/>
            impatient expectation. Do you expect, forsooth, that the <lb/>
            mother will inculcate virtuous principles, or other than she <lb/>
            cherishes herself ? It is right profitable too for a depraved <lb/>
            old hag to train her daughter to the same depravity.</p>

            her secret guilt, she counterfeits groans, or hates the servants, <lb/>
            or upbraids you with some rival of her own creation, with <lb/>
            tears ever fruitful, ever ready at their post, and only waiting <lb/>
            her command in what way to flow. You believe it genuine <lb/>
            love. You, poor hedge-sparrow, plume yourself, and kiss off <lb/>

            read, if you were but to examine the writing-case of that <lb/>
            adulteress that counterfeits jealousy so well!</p>
          <p>But suppose her actually caught in the arms of a slave or <lb/>
            knight. " Pray suggest in this case some colour able excuse, <lb/>

            myself. In spite of your outcry and confounding heaven and <lb/>
            sea, I am mortal." Nothing is more audacious than these <lb/>
            women when detected. They affect resentment, and borrow <lb/>
            courage from their very guilt itself.</p>
          <p>Yet should you ask whence are these unnatural prodigies, <lb/>
            or from what source they spring; it was their humble for­ <lb/>
            tune that made the Latin women chaste in days of yore, nor <lb/>
            did hard toil and short nights’ rest, and hands galled and hard­ <lb/>

            returns, you pass on your way to visit your great friends.</p>
          <p>The secrets of Bona Dea are well known. When the pipe <lb/>
            excites them, and inflamed alike with the horn and wine, <lb/>
            these Mænads of Priapus rush wildly round, and whirl their <lb/>
            locks and howl! Then, as their passions rise, how burning <lb/>
            is their lust, how frantic their words, when all power of re­ <lb/>
            straining their desires is lost! A prize is proposed, and <lb/>
            Saufeia4 challenges the vilest of her sex, and bears off the <lb/>
            prize. In these games nothing is counterfeit, all is acted to <lb/>
            the life; so that even the aged Priam, effete from years, or <lb/>
            Nestor himself, might be inflamed at the sight. Then their <lb/>
            lust admits of no delay. Then the woman appears in all her <lb/>

            the heap from which she takes would be ever full, she never <lb/>

            dorus cheats the barber of his fees. Such is his mistress' <lb/>

          <p>It is worth while to find out exactly what their occupations <lb/>
            and pursuits are through the livelong day. If her husband <lb/>
            has gone to sleep with his back towards her, the housekeeper <lb/>
            is half killed,-the tire-women are stript to be whipped,-the <lb/>
            Liburnian slave is accused of having come behind his time, <lb/>
            and is forced to pay the penalty of another's sleep; one has <lb/>
            rods broken 2 about him, another bleeds from the whips, a third <lb/>
            from the cow-hide. Some women pay a regular salary to <lb/>
            their torturers. While he lashes she is employed in enamel­ <lb/>
            ling her face. She listens to her friend's chat, or examines <lb/>
            the broad gold of an embroidered robe. Still he lashes. She <lb/>
            pores over the items in her long diary.3 Still he lashes. Un­ <lb/>
            til at length, when the torturers are exhausted, " Begone!" <lb/>
            she thunders out in awful voice, the inquisition being now <lb/>
            complete.</p>
          <p>The government of her house is no more merciful than the <lb/>
            court of a Sicilian tyrant. For if she has made an assign­ <lb/>

            usual, and is in a hurry, and has been some time already <lb/>

            " Why is this curl too high ? " Instantly the cow-hide avenges <lb/>
            the heinous crime of the misplacing of a hair. What has poor <lb/>

          <p>Another, on the left hand, draws out and combs her curls <lb/>

            name or life were at stake. So great is the anxiety of getting <lb/>
            beauty! Into so many tiers she forms her curls, so many <lb/>
            stages high she builds 2 her head ; in front you will look upon <lb/>

            buskins, she looks shorter than a Pigmy 3 maiden ; and must <lb/>
            spring lightly up on tiptoe for a kiss. No thought meanwhile <lb/>

            She lives as though she were merely a neighbour 4 of her hus­ <lb/>

            were all clothed in it. All who were about to celebrate her sacred rites <lb/>
            had their heads shaved. Isis married Osiris, who was killed by his brother <lb/>
            Typhon, and his body thrown into a well, where Isis and her son Anubis, <lb/>
            by the assistance of dogs, found it. Osiris was thenceforth deified under <lb/>
            the form of an ox, and called Apis : Anubis, under the form of a dog. <lb/>
            (Hence Virgo EEn. viii. 698, " Latrator Anubis.") An ox, therefore, <lb/>

            the wife does not refrain from nuptial joys on days to be ob­ <lb/>
            served as sacred, and a heavy penalty is incurred from the <lb/>
            violation of the snowy sheeting. And the silver serpent was <lb/>
            seen to nod his head! His are the tears, and his the studied <lb/>
            mumblings, that prevail on Osiris not to withhold pardon for <lb/>
            her fault, when bribed by a fat goose and a thin cake. When <lb/>
            he has withdrawn, some trembling Jewess, having quitted <lb/>
            her basket and hay, begs in her secret ear, the interpretess <lb/>
            of the laws of Solyma, the potent priestess of the tree-the <lb/>
            trusty go-between from highest heaven !1 And she crosses <lb/>
            her hand with money, but sparingly enough: for Jews will <lb/>
            sell you any dreams you please for the minutest coin. The <lb/>
            soothsayer of Armenia or Commagene,2 handling the liver of <lb/>
            the dove still reeking, engages that her lover shall be devoted, <lb/>
            or promises the rich inheritance of some childless rich man; <lb/>
            he pries into the breasts of chickens and the entrails of a <lb/>
            puppy ; sometimes too even of a child — he does acts of <lb/>
            which he will himself turn informer !3,</p>

            whatever the astrologer tells them, they will believe reported <lb/>
            straight from the fountain of Ammon; since at Delphi the <lb/>
            oracles are dumb, and darkness as to the future is the punish- <note type="footnote"> state, which Osiris was supposed to animate; but when it had reached a <lb/>
            certain age, (non est fas eum certos vitae excedere annos, Plin. viii. 46,) <lb/>
            it was drowned in a well (mersum in sacerdotum fonte enecant) with <lb/>
            much ceremonious sorrow, and the priests, attended by an immense con­ <lb/>
            course of people, dispersed themselves over the country, wailing and <lb/>
            lamenting, in quest of another with the prescribed marks (quaesituri <lb/>
            luctu alium quern substituant : et donee invenerint mærent, derasis etiam <lb/>

            were exchanged for songs of joy and shouts of <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐρρήκαμεν</foreign> (cf. viii. 29, <lb/>

            some days; and generally during these (or nine days at least) women <lb/>
            abstained from intercourse with their husbands. These rites were intro­ <lb/>

          <p>Yet these, when circumstances so require, are ready to en­ <lb/>
            counter the perils of childbirth, and endure all the irksome <lb/>
            toils of nursing. But rarely does a gilded bed contain a <lb/>
            woman lying-in : so potent are the arts and drugs of her that <lb/>
            can insure barrenness, and for bribes kill men while yet un­ <lb/>
            born. Yet grieve not at this, poor wretch! and with thine <lb/>
            own hand give thy wife the potion, whatever it be: for did <lb/>
            she choose to bear her leaping children in her womb, thou <lb/>
            wouldst perchance become the sire of an Æthiop; a blacka­ <lb/>
            moor would soon be your sole heir, one whom you would not <lb/>

          <p>I say nothing of supposititious children, and all a husband's <lb/>
            joys and fond hopes baffled at the dirty pools ;2 and the Pon­ <lb/>
            tifices and Salii selected thence, who are to bear in their <lb/>
            counterfeit persons the noble name of Scauri. Fortune, that <lb/>
            delights in mischief, takes her stand by night and smiles upon <lb/>
            the naked babes. All these she cherishes and fosters in her <lb/>
            bosom: then proffers them to the houses of the great, and <lb/>
            prepares in secret a rich sport for herself. These she dotes <lb/>
            on :3 on these she forces her favours ; and smiling, leads them <lb/>
            on to advancement as her own foster-children.</p>
          <p>One fellow offers a wife magical incantations. Another sells <lb/>
            her love-potions from Thessaly, to give her power to disturb her <lb/>
            husband's intellects, and punish him with the indignity of the <lb/>
            slipper. To these it is owing that you are reduced to dotage : <lb/>
            hence comes that dizziness of brain, that strange forgetfulness <note type="footnote"> 1 Mane. " The first thing seen " in the morning was a most important <lb/>

            endurable, if you do not go raving mad as well, like that uncle <lb/>

            ruptured were tottering to their fall, exactly as if Juno had <lb/>
            driven her spouse to madness. Therefore the mushroom I of <lb/>
            Agrippina had far less of guilt: since that stopped the breath <lb/>
            but of a single old man, and bade his trembling head descend <lb/>

          <p>Take my warning, ye that are under age and have a large <lb/>

          <p>All this is our invention ! and Satire is borrowing the tragic <lb/>

          <p>ALL our hope and inducement to study I tests on Caesar alone. <lb/>
            For he alone casts a favouring eye3 on the Muses, who in our <lb/>
            days are in a forlorn state. When poets, now become famous <lb/>
            and men of renown, would fain try and hire a little bath at <lb/>
            Gabii, or a public oven at Rome. While others, again, would <lb/>
            esteem it neither shocking nor degrading to turn public <lb/>
            criers: since Clio herself, if starving, would quit the vales of <lb/>
            Aganippe, and emigrate to courts.4 For if not a singles <lb/>
            farthing is offered you in the Pierian shades, be content with\ <lb/>
            the name and calling of Machaera : 5 and sooner sell what the <lb/>
            auction duly set6 sells to those that stand around ; wine­ <lb/>

            devices of the great man you pay court to, to avoid laying <lb/>
            out any money upon you: quitting the temple of the <lb/>

            yields the palm to Homer himself on the score of his priority <lb/>
            by a thousand years. But if inflamed by the charms of fame <lb/>
            you recite your poetry, he kindly lends you a dirty mansion, <lb/>
            and places at your service one that has been long barred up, <lb/>
            whose front gate emulates those of a city in a state of siege. <lb/>
            He knows how to place his freedmen in seats at the farther <lb/>
            end of the audience, and how to arrange his clients who are <lb/>
            to cheer you lustily. 1 None of these great lords will give you <lb/>
            as much as would pay for the benches,2 or the seats that rise <lb/>
            one above another on the platform you have to hire; or your <lb/>
            orchestra of chairs, which must be returned when your recit­ <lb/>

            in the profitless dust, and keep turning up the sea-shore with <lb/>
            sterile plough. For even if you try to abandon the pursuit, <lb/>
            the long habit 3 of indulging in this vain-glorious trifling,4 holds <lb/>
            you fast in its fetters. An inveterate itch of writing, now <lb/>

          <p>Your toil, forsooth, ye writers of histories ! is more profit­ <lb/>

            some fresh meat, if a sacrificial victim furnished any. Some <lb/>

            credible. Pliny says that Cicero himself, who accuses Verres of stealing <lb/>
            a Citrea mensa from Diodorus, (in Verr. iv. 17,) gave a million of sesterces <lb/>
            for one which was in existence in his time. A " Senatoris Census" was <lb/>
            a price given. These tables were not provided with several feet, but <lb/>
            rested on an ivory column, (sometimes carved into the figure of animals,) <lb/>
            hence called monopodia. They were called " Orbes," not from being <lb/>
            round, but because they were massive plates of wood cut off the stem in <lb/>
            its whole diameter. The wood of the citrus was most preferred. This <lb/>
            is not the citron-tree, which never attains to this bulk, but a tree found in <lb/>
            Mauritania, called the thyæ cypressides. Plin. xiii. 16. Those cut near <lb/>
            the root were most valued from the wood being variegated : hence " Ti­ <lb/>
            grinæ, pantherinæ, pavonum caudæ oculos imitantes." The mensæ were <lb/>
            formerly square, but were afterwards round to suit the new fashion of <lb/>
            the Sigma'couch. The Romans also understood the art of veneering <lb/>

            executed by Claudius, and repaired by Trajan. It is said to have employed <lb/>
            thirty thousand men for eleven years. Suetonius thus describes it (Claud. <lb/>
            c. 20): " Portum Ostiæ exstruxit circumducto dextra sinistrâque brachis, <lb/>
            et ad introitum profundo jam solo mole objecta, quam quo stabilius fun­ <lb/>

            (Cf. vi. 83. The Pharos of Alexandria was built by Sostratus, and ac­ <lb/>

          <p>The stork feeds her young on snakes2 and lizards which she <lb/>
            has discovered in the trackless fields. They too, when fledg­ <lb/>
            ed, go in quest of the same animals. The vulture, quitting <lb/>
            the cattle and dogs and gibbets, hastens to her callow brood, <lb/>
            and bears to them a portion of the carcass. Therefore this is <lb/>

              them, and displayed some curious feats of courage and dexterity. Aphro­ <lb/>

              cheerfulness, and the delights of a grand dinner, when their <lb/>

            balance in motion with the finger, until, perfect equilibrium being ob­ <lb/>

          <p>This Satire, as well as the tenth Satire of Juvenal, is based upon the Second <lb/>
            Alcibiades of Plato, which it closely resembles in arrangement as well as <lb/>
            sentiment.</p>
          <p>The object is the same in all three; to set before us the real opinion which <lb/>
            all good and worthy men entertained, even in the days of Pagan blindness, <lb/>
            of the manner and spirit in which the deity is to be approached by prayer <lb/>
            and sacrifice, and holds up to reprobation and ridicule the grovelling and <lb/>
            low-minded notions whieh the vulgar herd, besotted by ignorance and <lb/>
            blinded by self-interest, hold on the subject. While we admire the logical <lb/>
            subtlety with which Plato leads us to a necessary acknowledgment of the <lb/>
            justiee of his view, and the thoroughly practical philosophy by which Ju­ <lb/>
            venal would divert men from indulging in prayers dictated by mere self- <lb/>
            interest, we must allow Persius the high praise of having compressed the <lb/>
            whole subject with a masterly hand into a few vivid and comprehensive <lb/>
            sentences. <note type="footnote"> 1 Nonaria. Women of loose character were not permitted to show <lb/>

              and loungers. Callirhoe is probably some well-known nonaria of the <lb/>
              day. Persius advises hearers of this class to spend their mornings in <lb/>
              reading the prætor's edicts, and their evenings in sensual pleasures, as <lb/>
              the only occupations they were fit for. Marcilius says that it refers to an <lb/>
              edict of Nero's, who ordered the people to attend on a certain day to <lb/>
              hear him recite his poem of Callirhoe, which, as D'Achaintre says, <lb/>
              would be an admirable interpretation, were not the whole story of the <lb/>

          <p>The Satire consists of three parts. The first is merely an introduction to <lb/>
            the subject. Taking advantage of the custom prevalent among the Ro­ <lb/>
            mans of offering prayers and victims, and receiving presents and con­ <lb/>
            gratulatory addresses from their friends, on their birth-day, Persius sends <lb/>
            a poetical present to his friend Plotius Macrinus, with some hints on the <lb/>
            true nature of prayer. He at the same time compliments him on his <lb/>
            superiority to the mass of mankind, and especially to those of his own <lb/>
            rank, in the view he took of the subject.</p>
          <p>In the second part he exposes the vulgar errors and prejudices respecting <lb/>
            prayer and sacrifice, and shows that prayers usually offered are wrong, <lb/>
            1st, as to their matter, and 2ndly, as to their manner : that they originate <lb/>
            in low and sordid views of self-interest and avarice, in ignorant supersti­ <lb/>
            tion, or the cravings of an inordinate vanity. At the same time he holds <lb/>
            up to scorn the folly of those who offer up costly prayers, the fulfilment <lb/>
            of which they themselves render impossible, by indulging in vicious and <lb/>
            depraved habits, utterly incompatible with the requests they prefer. <lb/>
            Lastly, he explains the origin of these sordid and worse than useless <lb/>
            prayers. They arise from the impious and mistaken notions formed by <lb/>
            men who, vainly imagining that the Deity is even such a one as them­ <lb/>
            selves, endeavour to propitiate his favour in the same grovelling spirit, <lb/>
            and with the same unworthy offerings with which they would bribe the <lb/>
            good-will of one weak and depraved as themselves; as though, in Plato's <lb/>
            words, an <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐμπορικὴ, τὲΧνη</foreign> had been established between themselves and <lb/>
            heaven. The whole concludes with a sublime passage, describing in <lb/>
            language almost approaching the dignity of inspired wisdom, the state <lb/>
            of heart and moral feeling necessary to insure a favourable answer to <lb/>
            prayers preferred at the throne of heaven.</p>

            that he had studied in the house of Servilius. Britannicus calls him <lb/>

          <p>In this Satire, perhaps more than in any other, we detect Persius' predilec­ <lb/>
            tion for the doctrines of the Stoics. With them the summum bonum was <lb/>
            "the sound mind in the sound body." To attain which, man must ap­ <lb/>
            ply himself to the cultivation of virtue, that is, to the study of philosophy. <lb/>
            He that does not, can aspire to neither. Though unknown to himself, he <lb/>
            is labouring under a mortal disease, and though he fancies he possesses a <lb/>
            healthy intellect, he is the victim of as deep-seated and dangerous a de­ <lb/>
            lusion as the recognised maniac. The object of the Satire is to reclaim <lb/>
            the idle and profligate young nobles of his day from their enervating and <lb/>
            pernicious habits, by the illustration of these principles.</p>
          <p>The opening scene of the Satire presents us with the bed-chamber where <lb/>
            one of these young noblemen, accompanied by some other youths pro­ <lb/>
            bably of inferior birth and station, is indulging in sleep many hours after <lb/>
            the sun has risen upon the earth. The entrance of the tutor, who is a pro­ <lb/>
            fessor of the Stoical philosophy, disturbs their slumbers, and the confusion <lb/>
            consequent upon his rebuke, and the thin disguise of their ill-assumed <lb/>
            zeal, is graphically described. After a passionate outburst of contempt at <lb/>
            their paltry excuses, the tutor points out the irretrievable evils that will <lb/>
            result from their allowing the golden hours of youth to pass by unim­ <lb/>
            proved : overthrows all objections which are raised as to their position in <lb/>
            life, and competency of means rendering such vigorous application super- <note type="footnote"> 1 Litabo. Cf. v. 120, "Soli probi Ware dicuntur proprie: sacrificare <lb/>
            quilibet etiam improbi." Litare therefore is to obtain that for which the <lb/>
            sacrifice is offered. Vid. Liv. xxxviii. 20, " Postero die sacrificio facto <lb/>
            cum primis hostiis litasset." Plant. Pcenul. ii. 41, " Turn Jupiter faciat <lb/>

            610. Suet. Cæs. 81. Even the heathen could see that the deity regarded <lb/>
            the purity of the heart, not the costliness of the offering, of the sacrificer. <lb/>

              fluous ; and in a passage of solemn warning, full of majesty and power, <lb/>
              describes the unavailing remorse which will assuredly hereafter visit those <lb/>
              who have so far quitted the rugged path that leads to virtue's heights, that <lb/>
              all return is hopeless. He then proceeds to describe the defects of his own <lb/>
              education; and the vices he fell into in consequence of these defects- <lb/>
              vices however which were venial in himself, as those principles which <lb/>
              would have taught him their folly were never inculcated in him. Whereas <lb/>
              those whom he addresses, from the greater care that has been bestowed <lb/>
              on their early training, are without apology for their neglect of these pal­ <lb/>
              pable duties. Then, with great force and vigour, he briefly describes the <lb/>
              proper pursuits of well-regulated minds ; and looks down with contemptu­ <lb/>
              ous scorn on the sneers with which vulgar ignorance would deride these <lb/>
              truths, too transcendent for their gross comprehension to appreciate. The <lb/>
              Satire concludes very happily with the lively apologue of a glutton ; who, <lb/>
              in despite of all warning and friendly advice, perseveres even when his <lb/>
              health is failing, in such vicious and unrestrained indulgence, that he falls <lb/>
              at length a victim to his intemperance. The application of the moral is <lb/>
              simple. The mind that is destitute of philosophical culture is hopelessly <lb/>
              diseased, and the precepts of philosophy can alone effect a cure. He that <lb/>
              despises these, in vain pronounces himself to be of sound mind. On the <lb/>
              approach of any thing that can kindle the spark, his passions burst into <lb/>
              flame ; and in spite of his boasted sanity, urge him on to acts that would <lb/>
              call forth the reprobation even of the maniac himself. The whole Satire <lb/>
              and its moral, as Gifford says, may be fitly summed up in the solemn in­ <lb/>
              junction of a wiser man than the schools ever produced : " Wisdom is the <lb/>
              principal thing: therefore get Wisdom."</p>

            certain degree, to consecrate what was set on it. (Arnob. ii. 91, " Sacras <lb/>
            facitis mensas salinorum appositu.") Hence the salt-cellar became an <lb/>
            heir-loom, and descended from father to son. (Hor. ii. Od. xvi. 13, <lb/>
            " Vivitur parvo bene cui paternum splendet in mensâ tenui salinum.") <lb/>
            Even in the most frugal times, it formed part, sometimes the only piece, <lb/>

            emergencies, as e. g. A. U. c. 542, when all were called upon to sacrifice <lb/>

            worn by the equites on solemn processions. These were of two kinds, <lb/>
            the transvectio and the censio. The former is referred to here. It took <lb/>

            dressed in the trabea and crowned with olive wreaths, and saluted as they <lb/>
            passed the censors, who were seated in front of the temple of Castor in the <lb/>

            303. (Liv. ix. 46, fin. Aur. Vict. Vir. illustr. 32.) It afterwards fell <lb/>
            ;nto disuse, but was revived by Augustus. (Suet. Vit. 38.) In the censio, <lb/>
            which took place every five years only, the equites walked in procession <lb/>
            before the censors, leading their horses; all whom the censors approved of <lb/>
            were ordered to lead along their horses (equos traducere) ; those who had <lb/>

            Either of these passages might fairly serve as the argument of this Satire. <lb/>
            What, however, Persius really took as his model is the First Alcibiades of <lb/>
            Plato, and the imitation of it is nearly as close as is that of the Second Al­ <lb/>
            cibiades in the Second Satire. And the subject of his criticism is no less <lb/>
            a personage than Nero himself. The close analogy between Nero and <lb/>
            Alcibiades will be further alluded to in the notes. We must remember <lb/>
            that Nero was but seventeen years old when he was called to take the <lb/>
            reins of government, and was but three years younger then Persius him­ <lb/>
            self. The Satire was probably written before Nero had entirely thrown <lb/>
            off the mask; at all events, before he had given the full evidence which <lb/>
            he afterwards did of the savage ferocity and gross licentiousness of his true <lb/>
            nature. There was enough indeed for the stern Satirist to censure ; but <lb/>
            still a spark of something noble remaining, to kindle the hope that the <lb/>
            reproof might work improvement. In his First Satire he had ridiculed <lb/>
            his pretensions to the name of Poet; in this he exposes his inability as a <lb/>
            Politician.—The Satire naturally and readily divides itself into three parts. <lb/>
            In the first he ridicules the misplaced ambition of those who covet exalted <lb/>
            station, and aspire to take the lead in state affairs, without possessing those <lb/>
            qualifications of talent, education, and experience, which alone could fit <lb/>
            them to take the helm of government; and who hold that the adventitious <lb/>
            privileges of high birth and ancient lineage can countervail the enervating <lb/>
            effects of luxurious indolence and vicious self-indulgence. <unclear>The</unclear> second <lb/>
            division of the subject turns on the much-neglected duty of self-examina­ <lb/>
            tion ; and enforces the duty of uprightness and purity of conduct from the <lb/>
            consideration, that while it is hopeless in all to escape the keen scrutiny <lb/>
            that all men exercise in their neighbour's failings, while they are at the <lb/>
            same time utterly blind to their own defects, yet that men of high rank <lb/>
            and station must necessarily provoke the more searching criticism, in ex­ <lb/>
            act proportion to the elevation of their position. He points out also the <lb/>
            policy of checking all tendency to satirize the weakness of others, to which <lb/>
            Nero was greatly prone, and in fact had already aspired to the dignity of <lb/>
            a writer of Satire; as such sarcasm only draws down severer recrimination <lb/>
            on ourselves. In the third part he reverts to the original subject; and <lb/>
            urges upon the profligate nobles of the day the duty of rigid self-scrutiny, <lb/>
            by reminding them of the true character of that worthless rabble, on whose <lb/>
            sordid judgment and mercenary applause they ground their claims to ap­ <lb/>
             <pb n="236"/>
            probation. This love of the “aura popularis” was Nero's besetting vice; <lb/>
            and none could doubt for whom the advice was meant. Yet the allusions <lb/>
            to Nero throughout the Satire, transparent as they must have been to his <lb/>
            contemporaries, are so dexterously covered that Persius might easily have <lb/>
            secured himself from all charge of personally attacking the emperor, under <lb/>
            the plea that his sole object was a declamatory exercise in imitation of the <lb/>
            Dialogue of Plato.</p>
          <p>" DOST thou wield the affairs of the state ?1—(Imagine the <lb/>
            bearded2 master, whom the fell draught of hemlock3 took off, <lb/>
            to be saying this:)—Relying on what? Speak, thou ward4 <note type="footnote"> I Rem populi tractas? from the Greek <foreign xml:lang="grc">περὶ τω̃ν του̃ δήμου πραγμάτων <lb/>
            βουλεύεσθαι</foreign>. The imitations of the First Alcibiades are very close <lb/>
            throughout the Satire. Even in our own day, in looking back upon <lb/>
            ancient history, it would be difficult to find two persons so nearly coun­ <lb/>
            terparts of each other as Nero and Alcibiades ; not only in their personal <lb/>
            character, but in the adventitious circumstances of their life. Both came <lb/>
            into public life at a very early age. Nero was emperor before he was <lb/>
            seventeen years old, and Alcibiades was barely twenty at the siege of Po­ <lb/>
            tidæa. Seneca was to Nero what Socrates was to Alcibiades. Both de­ <lb/>
            rived their claims to pre-eminence from the mother's side : Nero through <lb/>
            Agrippina, from the Julian gens ; Alcibiades through Dinomache, from <lb/>
            the Alcmæonidæ. The public influence of both extended through nearly <lb/>
            the same period, thirteen years. Both were notorious for the same vices : <lb/>
            love of self-indulgence, ambition of pre-eminence, personal vanity, law­ <lb/>
            less insolence towards others, lavish expenditure, and utter disregard of <lb/>
            all principle. It would be very easy to carry out the parallel into greater <lb/>
            detail. Comp. Suet. Nero, c. 26, with Grote's Greece, vol. vii. ch. 55. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Barbatum. Cf. Juv. xiv. 12, " Barbatos licet admoveas mille inde <lb/>

            father, Clinias, having been killed at the battle of Coronea ; when he was <lb/>
            placed, with his younger brother Clinias, under the guardianship of Pe­ <lb/>
            ricles and his brother Ariphron, to whom his ungovernable passions, even <lb/>
            in his boyhood, were a source of great grief. Of this connexion Alci­ <lb/>
            biades was very proud. Cf. Plat. Ale. c. 1. Nero lost his father when <lb/>
            scarcely three years old ; and at the age of eleven, he was adopted by <lb/>
            Claudius and placed under the care of Annæus Seneca. It is curious <lb/>
            that the first public act of both was an act of liberality to the people. <lb/>
            Compare the account of Nero's proposing the Congiarium, (Suet. Nero, <lb/>
            c. 7,) with the anecdote of the quail of Alcibiades told by Plutarch (in <lb/>
            Vit. c. 10;. There is probably also a bitter sarcasm in the word " pupille,” <lb/>
            as it was the term of contempt applied to Nero by Poppæa, who was im­ <lb/>

            roads meet, from the old verb bito or beto. At these places altars, or <lb/>

            ing. (Jani bifrontes.) Cf. v. 35, " Ramosa in compita." Hence they <lb/>
            are called " pertusa," i. e. pervia, " open in all directions." At these <lb/>
            chapels it was the custom for the rustics to suspend the worn-out imple­ <lb/>
            ments of husbandry. Though some think this was more especially done <lb/>
            at the Compitalia. This festival was one of those which the Romans <lb/>
            called Feriæ Conceptivæ, being fixed annually by the Prætor. They <lb/>
            generally followed close upon the Saturnalia, and were held sometimes <lb/>
            three days before the kalends of January, sometimes on the kalends <lb/>
            themselves. Vid. Cic. Pis. iv. Auson. Ecl. de Fev., " Et nunquam <lb/>
            certis redeuntia testa diebus, Compita per vices quum sua quisque colit." <lb/>
            According to Servius, they are described, though not by name, by Virgil, <lb/>
            Æn. viii. 717. Like the Quinquatrus, they lasted only one day, and on <lb/>
            that occasion additional wooden chapels were erected, the sacrificial <lb/>
            cakes were provided by different houses, and slaves, not freed-men, pre­ <lb/>
            sided at the sacrifices. Vid. Plin. XXXVI. xxvii. 70. The gods whom <lb/>
            they worshipped are said to have been the Lares Compitales, of whom <lb/>
            various legends are current. But this is doubtful. Augustus appointed <lb/>
            certain rites in their honour, twice in the year. Suet. Vit. c. xxxi., <lb/>

            rem); yet he grudges scraping off the clay (limum) with which they used <lb/>
            to stop their vessels, in order to pour a libation of his sour wine. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Balanatum gausape. The Balanus, or " Arabian Balsam," was con­ <lb/>

            also a covert allusion to Nero, who, though so open to sarcasm, yet took <lb/>
            upon him to satirize others. Cf. ad Jnv. iv. 106, " Et tamen improbior <lb/>

            Persius, if accused, might maintain that he intended only the other sense, <lb/>
            which the words at first sight bear." Puteal is put for the forum itself <lb/>
            by synecdoche. It is properly the " puteal Libonis," a place which L. <lb/>
            Scribonius Libo caused to be enclosed (perhaps, cir. A. u. c. 604). It <lb/>
            had been perhaps a bidental, (cf. ad Sat. ii. 27,) or, as others say, the <lb/>
            place where the razor of the augur Naevius was deposited. Near it was <lb/>
            the prætor's chair, and the benches frequented by persons who had private <lb/>
            suits, amongst whom the class of usurers would be most conspicuous. <lb/>
            (Hence Hor. i. Epist. xix. 8, " Forum putealque Libonis Mandabo sic­ <lb/>
            cis." ii. Sat. vi. 35.) Puteal flagellare, therefore, is taken in its primitive <lb/>
            sense to mean, " to frequent the forum for the purpose of enforcing rigor­ <lb/>
            ous payment from those to whom you have lent money ; or the benches <lb/>
            of the usurers, in quest of persons to whom you may lend it on exorbi­ <lb/>

            celeresque Kalendas." Cic. Sext. 8. In its secondary sense, it may <lb/>
            apply to the nightly atrocities of Nero, who used to frequent the forum, <lb/>
            violently assaulting those he met, and outrageousl insulting females, not <lb/>

          <p>On this Satire, which is the longest and the best of all, Persius may be said <lb/>
            to rest his claims to be considered a Philosopher and a Poet. It may be <lb/>
            compared with advantage with the Third Satire of the second book of <lb/>
            Horace. As the object in that is to defend what is called the Stoical para­ <lb/>
            dox, " that none but the Philosopher is of sound mind," <lb/>
            " Quern mala stultitia et quemcunque inscitia veri <lb/>
            Caecum agit, insallum Chrysippi porticus et grex <lb/>
            Autumat: " i. 43—45. <lb/>
            so here, Persius maintains that other dogma of the Stoics, " that none but <lb/>
            the Philosopher is truly a free man." Horace argues (in the person of a <lb/>
            Stoic) that there can be but one path that leads in the right direction ; all <lb/>
            others must lead the traveller only further astray. " Unus utrique error <lb/>
            sed variis illudit partibus:" (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐσθλοὶ μὲν γὰρ ἁπλῶς παντοδαπῶς δὲ κακοί</foreign>. <lb/>
            Arist. Eth. II. vi. 4.) So Persius argues, whatever are the varied pursuits <lb/>
            of different minds, he that is under the influence of some overwhelming <lb/>
            passion, can offer no claim to be accounted a free agent. " Mille hominum <note type="footnote"> safety; who kept aloof until their services were required. Nero might <lb/>
            well therefore be called the " scourge of the Forum," and be said to <lb/>
            leave scars and wales behind him in the scenes of his enormities. Juvenal <lb/>
            (Sat. iii. 278, seq.) alludes to the same practices. A description of them <lb/>
            at full length may be found in Tacitus (Ann. xiii. 25) and Suetonius (Vit. <lb/>

              species, et rerum discolor usus." (52.) In fact, if we substitute free­ <lb/>
              dom " for " wisdom," the whole argument of the last part of the Satire <lb/>
              may be expressed in the two lines of Horace : <lb/>
              " Quisquis <lb/>
              Ambitione malâ aut argenti pallet amore <lb/>
              Quisquis Luxuria tristive Superstitions <lb/>
              Aut alio mentis morbo calet:" <lb/>
              that man can neither be pronounced free or of sound mind.</p>
          <p>The Satire consists of two parts; the first serving as a Proëm to the other. <lb/>
            It is, in fact, the earnest expression of unbounded affection for his tutor <lb/>
            and early friend Annæus Cornutus, from whom he had imbibed those <lb/>
            principles of philosophy, which it is the object of the latter part of the <lb/>
            Satire to elucidate. After a few lines of ridicule at the hackneyed pro­ <lb/>
            logues of the day, he puts into the mouth of Cornutus that just criticism <lb/>
            of poetical composition which there is very little doubt Persius had in re­ <lb/>
            ality derived from his master; and in answer to this, he takes occasion to <lb/>
            profess his sincere and deep-seated love and gratitude towards the pre­ <lb/>
            ceptor, whose kind care had rescued him from the vicious courses to which <lb/>
            a young and ardent temperament was leading him; and whose sound <lb/>
            judgment and dexterous management had weaned him from the tempta­ <lb/>
            tions that assail the young, by making him his own companion in those <lb/>
            studies which expanded his intellect while they rectified the obliquity (to <lb/>
            use the Stoics' phrase) of his moral character. Such mutual affection, he <lb/>
            urges, could only exist between two persons whom something more than <lb/>
            mere adventitious circumstances drew together; and he therefore concludes <lb/>
            that the same natal star must have presided over the horoscope of both.</p>
          <p>He then proceeds to the main subject of the Satire, viz. that all men should <lb/>
            aim at attaining that freedom which can only result from that perfect <lb/>
            " soundness of mind " which we have shown to be the summum bonum <lb/>
            of the Stoics. This real freedom no mere external or adventitious cir­ <lb/>
            cumstances can bestow. Dama, though freed at his master's behest, if he <lb/>
            be the slave of passion, is as much a slave as if he had never felt the prae­ <lb/>
            tor's rod. Until he have really cast off, like the snake, the slough of his <lb/>
            former vices, and become changed in heart and principles as he is in po­ <lb/>
            litical standing, he is so far from being really free from bondage that he <lb/>
            cannot rightly perform even the most trivial act of daily life. True free­ <lb/>
            dom consists in virtue alone; but " Virtus est vitium fugere :" and he <lb/>
            who eradicates all other passions, but cherishes still one darling vice, has <lb/>
            but changed his master. The dictates of the passions that sway his breast <lb/>
            are more imperious than those of the severest task-master. Whether it be <lb/>
            avarice, or luxury, or love, or ambition, or superstition, that is the domi­ <lb/>
            nant principle, so long as he cannot shake himself free from the control of <lb/>
            these, he is as much, as real a slave as the drudge that bears his master's <lb/>
            strigil to the bath, or the dog that fancies he has burst his bonds while the <lb/>
            long fragment of his broken chain still dangles from his neck. The last <lb/>
            few lines contain a dignified rebuke of the sneers which such pure senti­ <lb/>
            ments as these would provoke in the coarse minds of some into whose hands <lb/>
            these lines might fall; perhaps, too, they may be meant as a gentle reproof <lb/>
            of the sly irony in which the Epicurean Horace indulged, while professing <lb/>
            to enunciate the Stoic doctrine, that none but the true Philosopher can be <lb/>
            said to be of sound mind.</p><pb n="243"/>

            He was a native of Leptis, in Africa, and came to Rome in the reign of <lb/>
            Nero, where he applied himself with success to the education of young <lb/>
            men. He wrote on Philosophy, Rhetoric, and a treatise entitled <foreign xml:lang="grc">ή έλλη­ <lb/>
            νική ϑεολογία</foreign>. Persius, at the age of sixteen, (A. D. 50,) placed himself <lb/>
            under his charge, and was introduced by him to Lucan ; and at his death <lb/>
            left him one hundred sestertia and his library. Cornutus kept the books, <lb/>
            to the number of seven hundred, but gave back the money to Persius' <lb/>
            sisters. Nero, intending to write an epic poem on Roman History, con­ <lb/>

            words not removed from ordinary use, but such as were in use in the <lb/>
            most elegant and polished society of Rome, as distinguished from the <lb/>

            was carried out to burial. (Juv. Sat. iii. 172.) But then, according to <lb/>
            Horace's precept, (" Dixeris egregiè si notum callida verbum reddiderit <lb/>
            junctura novum," A. P. 47,) grace and dignity was added to these by the <lb/>
            novelty of effect produced by judicious combination. Cf. Cic. de Orat. <lb/>

            time to put on the sagum, but were forced to fight in the toga. Hence <lb/>

            rolled in one of the tribes, in order that he might enjoy the full privileges <lb/>

            the right of receiving a ticket which entitled him to his share at the dis­ <lb/>
            tribution of the public corn, which took place on the nones of each <lb/>
            month. This ticket or tally was of wood or lead, and was transferable. <lb/>
            Sometimes a small sum was paid with it. Cf. Juv. vii. 174, " Summula <lb/>
            ne pereat qua vilis tessera venit frumenti." The slave generally adopted <lb/>
            the prænomen of the person who manumitted him, and the name of <lb/>
            the tribe to which he was admitted was added. This prænomen <lb/>
            was the distinguishing mark of a free-man, and they were proportionally <lb/>
            proud of it. (Hor. ii. Sat. v. 32, " Quinte, puta, aut Publi,—gaudent <lb/>

            is alluded to here. The master took the slave before the prætor or con­ <lb/>

            the prætor, laying the rod (Vindicta) on the slave's head, pronounced <lb/>
            him free ; whereupon his owner or the lictor turned him round, gave him <lb/>

            Sambuca is from the Chaldaic Sabbecà. It was a kind of triangular <lb/>
            harp with four strings, and according to the Greeks, was called from one <lb/>
            Sambuces, who first used it. Others say the Sibyl was the first performer <lb/>
            on it. Ibycus of Rhegium was its reputed inventor, as Anacreon of <lb/>
            the Barbiton: but from its mention in the book of Daniel, (iii. 5,) it was <lb/>
            probably of earlier date. A female performer on it was called Sambucis­ <lb/>

            much diversity of opinion among the philosophers of old as in the present <lb/>
            day. Some maintaining that not only a virtuous, but also a happy life <lb/>
            consisted in the absence of all those external aids that wealth can bestow ; <lb/>
            others as zealously arguing that a competency of means was absolutely <lb/>
            necessary to the due performance of the higher social virtues. The source <lb/>
            of error in most men lies in their mistaking the means for the end ; and <lb/>
            the object of this Satire, which is the most original, and perhaps the most <lb/>
            pleasing of the whole, is to point out how a proper employment of the for­ <lb/>
            tune that falls to our lot may be made to forward the best interests of man. <lb/>
            —Persius begins with a warm encomium on the genius and learning of his <lb/>
            friend Cæsius Bassus, the lyric poet; especially complimenting him on his <lb/>
            antiquarian knowledge, and versatility of talent: and he then proceeds to <lb/>
            show, by setting forth his own line of conduct, how true happiness may <lb/>
            be attained by avoiding the extremes of sordid meanness on the one hand, <lb/>
            and ostentatious prodigality on the other ; by disregarding the suggestions <lb/>
            of envy and the dictates of ambition. A prompt and liberal regard to the <lb/>
            necessities and distresses of others is then inculcated; for this, coupled <lb/>
            with the maintenance of such an establishment as our fortune warrants us <lb/>
            in keeping up, is, to use the words of the poet, " to use wealth, not to abuse <lb/>
            it." He then proceeds with great severity and bitter sarcasm to expose <lb/>
            the shallow artifices of those who attempt to disguise their sordid selfish­ <lb/>
            ness under the specious pretence of a proper prudence, a reverence for the <lb/>
            ancient simplicity and frugality of manners, and a proper regard for the <lb/>
            interests of those who are to succeed to our inheritance. The Satire con­ <lb/>
            cludes with a lively and graphic conversation between Persius and his <lb/>
            imaginary heir, in which he exposes the cupidity of those who are waiting <lb/>
            for the deaths of men whom they expect to succeed; and shows that the <lb/>
            anxiety of these for the death of their friends, furnishes the strongest mo­ <lb/>
            tive for a due indulgence in the good things of this life; which it would <lb/>
            be folly to hoard up merely to be squandered by the spendthrift, or feed <lb/>
            the insatiable avarice of one whom even boundless wealth could never <lb/>
            satisfy. This Satire was probably written, as Gifford says, " while the poet <lb/>
            was still in the flower of youth, possessed of an independent fortune, of <lb/>
            estimable friends, dear connexions, and of a cultivated mind, under the <lb/>
            consciousness of irrecoverable disease : a situation in itself sufficiently af­ <lb/>
            fecting, and which is rendered still more so, by the placid and even cheer­ <lb/>
            ful spirit which pervades every part of the poem."</p>

            for this purpose usually returned from Rome to their country-houses. <lb/>

            Athens. There were three festivals of this kind, according to Suidas, the <lb/>
            Panathenæan, Hephæstian, and Promethean. In the latter, they ran from <lb/>
            the altar of Prometheus through the Ceramicus to the city. The object <lb/>
            of the runners in these races was to carry a lighted torch to the end of <lb/>
            their courses. But the manner of the running is a disputed point among <lb/>
            the commentators. Some say three competitors started together, and he <lb/>
            that carried his torch unextinguished to the goal was victorious. Others <lb/>
            say the runners were stationed at different intervals, and the first who <lb/>
            started gave up his torch at the first station to another, who took up the <lb/>
            running, and in turn delivered it to a third ; and to this the words of <lb/>
            Lucretius seem to refer, ii. 77, “ Inque brevi spatio mutantur sæcla ani­ <lb/>
            mantûm Et quasi cursores vital lampada tradunt.” Others again think <lb/>
            that several competitors started, but one only bore a torch, which, when <lb/>
            wearied, he delivered to some better-winded rival; which view is sup­ <lb/>

          <p>THE occasion of the following Satire is generally known as " the <lb/>
            expulsion of the philosophers from Rome by Domitian.” As the <lb/>
            same thing took place under Vespasian also, it becomes worth while <lb/>
            to inquire who are the persons intended to be included under this <lb/>
            designation; and in what manner the fears of the two emperors <lb/>
            could be so worked upon, as to pass a sweeping sentence of banish­ <lb/>
            ment against persons apparently so helpless and so little formidable <lb/>
            as the peaceful cultivators of philosophy. It seems not improbable <lb/>
            then that the fears both of Vespasian and Domitian were of a per­ <lb/>
            sonal as well as of a political nature. We find that in both cases <lb/>
            the " Mathematici ” are coupled with the " Philosophi." Now these <lb/>
            persons were no more nor less than pretenders to the science of <lb/>
            judicial astrology [cf. Juv. iii. 43 ; vi. 562 ; xiv. 248 ; Suet. Cal. <lb/>
            57 ; Tit. 9 ; Otho, 4 ; Gell. i. 9] ; and to what an extent those who <lb/>
            were believed to possess this knowledge were dreaded in those days <lb/>
            of gross superstition, may be easily inferred by merely looking into <lb/>
            Juvenal's sixth and Persius' fifth Satire. Besides the baleful effects <lb/>
            of incantations, which were sources of terror even in Horace's days, <lb/>
            the mere possession by another of the nativity of a person whose <lb/>
            death might be an object of desire to the bearer, was supposed, at <lb/>
            the time of which we are now speaking, to be a sufficient ground <lb/>
            of serious alarm. We are not surprised therefore to find it recorded <lb/>
            as an instance of great generosity on the part of Vespasian, that on <lb/>
            one occasion he pardoned one Metius Pomposianus, although he was <lb/>
            informed that he had in his possession a " Genesis Imperatoria;" <lb/>
            or that the possession of a similar document with regard to Domi­ <lb/>
            tian cost the owner his life. (Cf. Suet. Vesp. 14; Domit. 10.) <lb/>
             <pb n="270"/>
            With regard to the philosophers, it appears that the followers of <lb/>
            the Stoic school were those against whom the edict was especially <lb/>
            directed. Not only did the tenets of this school inculcate that in­ <lb/>
            dependence of thought and manners most directly at variance with <lb/>
            the servility and submissiveness inseparable from a state of thraldom <lb/>
            under a despot; but the cultivation of this branch of philosophy <lb/>
            was held to be nothing more than a specious cover for an attach­ <lb/>
            ment to the freedom of speech and action enjoyed under the re­ <lb/>
            publican form of government; and philosophy was accounted only <lb/>
            another name for revolution and rebellion.'</p>
          <p>The story told of Demetrius the Cynic, in Dio, (Ixvi. 13,) and <lb/>
            confirmed by Suetonius, (Vesp. c. 13,) illustrates this view of the <lb/>
            subject. (Cf. Tac. Hist. iv. 40.) It appears to have been at the <lb/>
            suggestion of Mucianus,2 that all philosophers, but especially the <lb/>
            Stoics, were banished from Rome ; and that the celebrated Muso­ <lb/>
            nius Rufus was the only one who was suffered to remain. This <lb/>
            took place A. D. 74. Sixteen years after this we find a decree of <lb/>
            the senate passed to a similar effect. Now, as philosophy may be <lb/>
            studied equally well any where, there seems no reason why, if it <lb/>
            were not in some way connected with their political creed, all these <lb/>
            votaries of Stoicism should in the interim have taken up their abode <lb/>
            at Rome. And though, no doubt, the unoffending may have suf­ <lb/>
            fered with the guilty, the history of the edict seems pretty plainly <lb/>
            to show what particular doctrines of their philosophy were so ob­ <lb/>
            noxious to Domitian. Suetonius, Tacitus, and Dio all agree in the <lb/>
            cause assigned for the sentence : viz. that Juuius Arulenus Rusticus <lb/>
            and Herennius Senecio had been enthusiastic in their praises of <lb/>
            Thrasea Pætus and Helvidius Priscus; and that therefore " all phi­ <lb/>
            losophers were removed from Rome." (" Cujus criminis occasione <lb/>
            philosophos omnes Urbe Italiàque submovit." Suet. Domit. 10. <lb/>
            Cf. Tac. Agric. 2. Dio, lxvii. 13.) But it was for their undisguised <lb/>
            hatred of tyrants, and for no dogma of the schools, that the former <lb/>
            of these was put to death by Nero, and the latter by Vespasian. <lb/>
            Both of them, as we know, celebrated with no ordinary festivities <lb/>
            the birth-days of the Bruti (Juv. v. 36); and Helvidius, even while <note type="footnote"> 1 Vid. Niebuhr's Lectures, in. p. 212. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Licinius Mucianus, the governor of Syria. He belonged to the noble <lb/>

            prætor, went so far as to omit all titles of honour or distinction be­ <lb/>
            fore the name of Vespasian. (Suet. Vesp. 15.) We must not <lb/>
            therefore fall into the common error of supposing this " banish­ <lb/>
            ment of philosophers " to have been a mere act of wanton, sense­ <lb/>
            less tyranny, or of brutal ignorance. Even by his enemies' show­ <lb/>
            ing, the opening scenes of Domitian's life' are at direct variance <lb/>
            with such an idea. (Cf. ad Juv. vii. 1.) And though we regret <lb/>
            to find that men like Epictetus and Dio of Prusa were included in <lb/>
            the disastrous sentence, it is some relief to learn that Pliny the <lb/>
            younger, though living at the time in the house of the philosopher <lb/>
            Artemidorus, and the intimate friend of Senecio and six or seven <lb/>
            others of the banished, to whom he supplied money, (a fact which, <lb/>
            as he himself hints, could not but have been known to the emperor, <lb/>
            as Pliny was prætor at the time,) yet escaped unscathed. (Cf. Plin. <lb/>
            iii. Ep. XI. vii. 19. Gell. xv. 11.)</p>
          <p>How far Sulpicia was connected with this movement, or whether <lb/>
            she was involved in the same sentence which overwhelmed the <lb/>
            others, we have now no means of ascertaining. It is quite clear <lb/>
            that all her sympathies were with the Greeks; and the passage <lb/>
            concerning Scipio and Cato (1. 45—50) leaves little doubt that her <lb/>
            philosophical opinions were those of the Stoics. She rivals Juvenal <lb/>
            in her thorough hatred of Domitian ; which may, perhaps, be partly <lb/>
            also attributed to family reasons. For we must remember that she <lb/>
            belonged to the gens which produced Servius Sulpicius Galba ; and, <lb/>
            as we have noticed on many occasions with regard to Juvenal, an <lb/>
            attachment to that emperor seems to go hand in hand with hatred <lb/>
            of Otho and Domitian. From the conclusion of the Satire, it is <lb/>
            probable that her husband was not implicated. <note type="footnote"> 1 “ Domitian was a man of a cultivated mind and decided talent, and is <lb/>
            of considerable importance in the history of Roman literature. The Para­ <lb/>
            phrase of Aratus, which is usually ascribed to Germanicus, is the work of <lb/>
            Domitian. The subject of the poem is poor, but it is executed iu a very <lb/>
            respectable manner. Domitian's taste for Roman literature produced its <lb/>
            beneficial effects. He instituted the great pension for rhetoricians, which <lb/>
            Quintilian, for example, enjoyed, and the Capitoline contests, in which the <lb/>
            prize poems were crowned. During this period, Roman literature received <lb/>
            a great impulse, to which Domitian himself must have contributed. From <lb/>
            his poem we see that he was opposed to the false taste of the time." Nie­ <lb/>
            buhr's Lectures, iii. p. 216. 7. </note></p><pb n="272"/>
            
          <p>The Sulpician gens produced many distinguished men ; of whom <lb/>
            we may mention the commissioner sent to Greece, and the con­ <lb/>
            querors of the Samnites, of Sardinia, and of Pyrrhus, besides the <lb/>
            notorious friend of Marius. Of this illustrious stock she was no <lb/>
            unworthy scion. Martial1 bears the strongest testimony to the <lb/>
            purity of her morals and the chastity of her life, as well as to her <lb/>
            devoted conjugal affection; which latter virtue she illustrated in a <lb/>
            poem replete with the most lively, delicate, and virtuous sentiments; <lb/>
            and which, had not the licentiousness of the age been beyond such <lb/>
            a cure, might have produced a deep moral effect on the peculiar <lb/>
            vices which especially disgraced the æra of the Cæsars. Her bus­ <lb/>
            band's name was Calenus, who not improbably belonged to the <lb/>
            Fufian gens,2 and with him she enjoyed fifteen years of the purest <lb/>
            domestic felicity, as we learn from the Epigram addressed to him <lb/>
            by Martial, in which, not without a tinge of envy, he congratulates <lb/>
            Calenus on the possession of so inestimable a treasure. Both Epi­ <lb/>
            grams are exceedingly beautiful, and every reader of Martial will <lb/>
            be only too ready to say, " 0 si sic omnia." Of her other works <lb/>
            we unfortunately do not possess a single fragment;3 and even the <lb/>
            solitary Satire which bears her name, was at one time, as Scaliger <lb/>
            tells us, falsely attributed to Ausonius.</p>
          <p>Very much of the Satire is corrupt. Wernsdorf's seems, on the <lb/>
            whole, the best approximation to a true reading; and the Com­ <lb/>
            mentary of Dousa is, as far as it goes, satisfactory. <note type="footnote"> I Lib. x. Epig. 35 and 38. There is nothing in these two Epigrams to <lb/>
            imply that Sulpicia and Calenus were not both living peacefully and hap­ <lb/>

            he says himself, that he scarcely produced one book in a year, (x. 70,) and <lb/>
            lib. ix. was written A. D. 94 or 95. The second edition of his tenth book <lb/>
            came out A. D. 99. The Epigrams to Calenus and Sulpitia were probably <lb/>
            therefore written at least six years after the Edict of Domitian, i. e. between <lb/>
            A. D. 90 and 99. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Vid. not. ad 1. 62. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 With the exception of a doubtful fragment quoted by the old Scholiast <lb/>

          <p>The Satire opens with an Invocation of Calliope, the Mnse of Heroic poetry. <lb/>
            The dignity of the subject, which is in fact the undeserved sufferings of <lb/>
            the good and great men whom Domitian's edict was ejecting from their <lb/>
            homes, deserves a higher strain than is compatible with the more common- <lb/>
            place, and therefore less powerful, invectives of Iambic metre. The effect <lb/>
            produced by such a measure is described as nothing less than forcing the <lb/>
            civilized world to retrograde to a state of primeval barbarism. The cause <lb/>
            which has led to such a perversion of taste and degradation of intellect is <lb/>
            then examined; which arc shown to be the result of a long-protracted peace. <lb/>
            The old Roman valour which had raised the city to the proud position <lb/>
            promised by the father of gods and men, had become gradually enervated <lb/>
            and enfeebled, as it ceased to have an object on which to exercise itself.— <lb/>
            The stern and rigid virtue of the best period of the city's history, which <lb/>
            had led her greatest men, even in the fierce struggles for existence against <lb/>
            the rival republic, to appreciate and patronize the philosophy of Greece, <lb/>
            the love of country and the ties of brotherhood which had been fostered <lb/>
            by that “ rugged nurse Adversity," were now all buried in the corpse-like <lb/>
            lethargy induced by the enervating influence of a lengthened peace.-The <lb/>
            Satire concludes with a bitter denunciation of coming vengeance against <lb/>

          <p>GRANT me, 0 Muse,1 to tell my little tale in a few words, <lb/>
            in those numbers in which thou art wont to celebrate2 heroes <lb/>

            of Archilochus, or the Scazontics of Hipponax, but of writing in the good <lb/>
            old Heroic metre. She therefore invokes the aid of Calliope. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Frequentas. " Celebrare ” is often used in the sense of " crowding <lb/>

            (p. 2440) to have been the inventor of the Hendecasyllabic metre, which <lb/>
            consists of five feet; the first a Spondee or lamb., the second a Dactyl, <lb/>
            and the three last Trochees. Many of Catullus's pieces are in this metre. <lb/>
            E. g. " Lugete, 0 Veneres, Cupidinesque." Vid. Hermann, Elem. <lb/>

            nosi applied to these verses by Horace, (i. Od. xvi. 2,) and truces by <lb/>
            Catullus (xxxvi. 5). Archilochus, the Parian, who flourished in the <lb/>
            eighth century B. C., (Cic. Tusc. Q. i. I ; Bähr ad Herod. i. 12,) is said <lb/>
            to have been the inventor of the metre, and to have employed it against <lb/>
            Lycambes, who had promised. him his daughter Neobule, but afterwards <lb/>
            retracted. Cf. Hor. A. P. 79, " Archilochum proprio rabies armavit <lb/>
            lambo." i. Ep. xix. 23, " Parios ego primus lambos Ostendi Latio nu­ <lb/>
            meros animosque secutus Archilochi non res et agentia verba Lycam­ <lb/>
            ben." The allusion in the next line is to Hipponax, who flourished cir. <lb/>
            B. c. 540; 01. Ix. He was a native of Ephesus; but being expelled <lb/>
            from his native country by the tyrant Athenagoras, he settled at Clazo­ <lb/>
            menæ, now the Isle of St. John. The common story is, that he was so <lb/>
            hideously ugly, that the sculptors Bupalus and Athenis caricatured him. <lb/>
            And to avenge this insult, Hipponax altered the Iambic of Archilochus <lb/>
            into a more bitter form by making the last foot a spondee, which gave <lb/>
            the verse a kind of halting rhythm, and was hence called Scazontic, from <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϭκάζω̇</foreign> or Choliambic, from <foreign xml:lang="grc">χω̃λος</foreign>," lame." Diomed. iii. 503. [A <lb/>
            specimen may be seen in Martial's bitter Epigram against Cato. i. Ep. <lb/>
            1, " Cur in Theatrum Cato severe venisti ?"J In this metre he so bit­ <lb/>
            terly satirized them that they banged themselves, as Lycambes had done, <lb/>
            in consequence of the ridicule of Archilochus. Hence Horace, vi. Epod. <lb/>
            13, " Qualis Lycambæ spretus infido gener Aut acer hostis Bupalo." <lb/>
            Pliny (H. N. xxxvi. 5) treats the whole story as mythical. Cf. Mart. <lb/>
            i. Ep. 97, for some good specimens, and Catull. xxxix. Another form <lb/>
            of Choliambic verse is the substitution of an Antibacchius for the final <lb/>
            Iamb. : e. g. " Remittc pallium mihi quod involasti." Catull. xxv. <lb/>
            Two of Hipponax's verses may be seen, Strabo, lib. xiv. c. 1. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Cætera. From the high compliment paid to her chastity and poetical <lb/>
            powers by Martial, it is probable that Sulpicia had composed many poems <lb/>
            before the present Satire. From the metre Martial chooses for his com­ <lb/>
            plimentary effusion, and from the testimony of the old Scholiast, it is <lb/>
            probable these verses were in Hendecasyllabics ; or at all events in some <lb/>
            lyrical metre. There was a poetess named Cornificia in the time of <lb/>

            thee I invoke, in those points in which thou art chief of all, <lb/>

          <p>Tell me, 0 Calliope, what is it the great3 father of the gods <lb/>
            purposes to do ? Does he revert to earth, and his father's age ; <lb/>
            and wrest from us in death the arts that once he gave; and <lb/>
            bid us, in silence, nay, bereft of reason too, just as when we <lb/>
            arose in the primeval age,4 stoop again5 to acorns,6 and the <lb/>

            lands and cities, but thrusts away7 the race of Ausonia, and <lb/>
            the nurselings of Remus ? 8</p>
          <p>For, what must we suppose ? There are two ways by which <lb/>
            Rome reared aloft her mighty head. Valour in war, and <note type="footnote"> ficius, the reputed enemy of Virgil, (vid. Clinton, F. H. in ann. B. c. 41,) <lb/>
            but as she was not a lyrical poetess, Sulpicia claims the palm to herself. </note><note type="footnote"> I Constanter. The subject is too serious and solemn for lyrical poetry; <lb/>
            she therefore employs the dignity of Heroic verse. So Juvenal, iv. 34, <lb/>
            " Incipe Calliope—non est cantandum, res vera agitur, narrate puellæ <lb/>
            Pierides." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Descende. Cf. Hor. iii. Od. iv. 1, " Descende coelo et die age tibia <lb/>

            holds the chief place. (Cf. Anson. Id. xx. 7, " Carmina Calliope libris <lb/>
            Heroïca mandat.") Hence " Princeps." So Hesiod Theog. 79, <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κ</foreign>u<foreign xml:lang="grc">λ­ <lb/>

            Dusa proposes to read Cætera quœ, for Cæteraque, and to place the line <lb/>

            <title type="sub">INTRODUCTION.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>IF but little is known of the personal character and life of the <lb/>
            other Satirists of Rome, it is unfortunately still more the case with <lb/>
            Lucilius. Although the research and industry of modern scholars <lb/>
            have collected nearly a hundred passages from ancient writers where <lb/>
            his name is mentioned, the information that can be gleaned from <lb/>
            them with respect to the events of his life is very scanty indeed; and <lb/>
            even of these meagre statements, there is scarcely one that has not <lb/>
            been called in question by one or more critics of later days. It will <lb/>
            be therefore, perhaps, the most satisfactory course to present in a <lb/>
            continuous form the few facts we can gather respecting his personal <lb/>
            history; and to mention afterwards the doubts that have been thrown <lb/>
            on these statements, and the attempts of recent editors to reconcile <lb/>
            them with the accredited facts of history.</p>
          <p>Caius Lucilius, then, was born, according to the testimony of <lb/>
            S. Hieronymus, (in Euseb. Chron.,) B. c. 148, in the first year <lb/>
            of the 158th Olympiad, and the 606th of the founding of the <lb/>
            city, (Varronian Computation,) in the consulship of Spurius <lb/>
            Posthumius Albinus and Lucius Calpurnius Piso. There was a <lb/>
            plebeian Lucilian gens, as well as a patrician, but it was to the <lb/>
            latter that the family of the poet undoubtedly belonged. Horace <lb/>
            says of himself, (ii. Sat. i. 74,) " Quidquid sum ego, quamvis infra <lb/>
            Lucili censum ingeniumque tamen me cum magnis vixisse invita <lb/>
            fatebitur usque Invidia." Porphyrion, in his commentary on the <lb/>
            passage, says, Lucilius was the great uncle of Pompey the Great; <lb/>
            Pompey's grandmother being the poet's sister. But Acron says he <lb/>
            was Pompey's grandfather. Velleius Paterculus, (ii. 29,) on the <lb/>
            other hand, says that Lucilia, the mother of Pompey, was daughter <lb/>
            of the brother of Lucilius, and of senatorian family.</p>
          <p>His birth-place was Suessa, now Sessa, capital of the Aurunci, in <note type="footnote"> 1 In the Translation, the text and arrangement of Gerlach have been <lb/>
            principally followed. The few Fragments that have not been translated, are <lb/>
            omitted, either from their hopelessly corrupt state, their obscenity, or from <lb/>
            their consisting of single, and those unimportant, words. </note> <lb/>

            Campania; hence Juvenal (Sat. i. 19) says, " Cur tamen hoc potius <lb/>
            libeat decurrere campo, per quern magnus equos Auruncæ flexit <lb/>
            alumnus, Si vacat et placidi rationem admittitis edam ;" and Auso­ <lb/>
            nius, (Ep. xv.,) " Rudes Camænas qui Suessæ prævenis.” At the <lb/>
            age of fifteen, B. C. 134, he accompanied his patron, L. Scipio Afri­ <lb/>
            canus Æmilianus, to the Numantine war, where he is said to have <lb/>
            served as eqnes. Veil. Pat. ii. 9, 4. Here he met with Marius, <lb/>
            now about in his twenty-third year, and the young Jugurtha ; who <lb/>
            were also serving under Africanus, and learning, as Velleius says, <lb/>
            “ that art of war, which they were afterwards to employ against <lb/>
            each other." In the following year Numantia was taken and razed <lb/>
            to the ground, and Lucilius returned with his patron to Rome, <lb/>
            shortly after the sedition and death of Tiberius Gracchus; and <lb/>
            lived on terms of the most familiar friendship with him and C. Læ­ <lb/>
            lius, until the death of Scipio, B. c. 129; and even at that early age <lb/>
            had already acquired the reputation of a distinguished Satirist. <lb/>
            According to Pighius, (in Tabulis,) he held the office of quæstor, <lb/>
            B. c. 127, two years after Scipio's death, and the prætorship, a. c. <lb/>
            117. Van Heusde is also of opinion that he acted as publicanus; <lb/>
            and from a passage in Cicero, (de Orat. ii. 70,) some suppose he <lb/>
            kept large flocks of sheep on the Ager publicus. Besides Africanus <lb/>
            and Lælius, (with whose father-in-law Crassus, however, he was <lb/>
            not on very good terms, vid. Cic. de Or. i. 16,) he is said to have <lb/>
            enjoyed the friendship of the following distinguished men, Sp. Al­ <lb/>
            binus, L. Ælius Stilo, Q. Vectius, Archelaus, P. Philocomus, Lælius <lb/>
            Decimus, and Q. Granins Præco. He had a violent quarrel with <lb/>
            C. Cælius, for acquitting a man who had libelled him. He is said <lb/>
            to have lived under Velia, where the temple of Victory afterwards <lb/>
            stood, in a house built at the public expense for the son of king <lb/>
            Antiochus when hostage at Rome. (Asc. Pedian. in Ciceron. Orat. <lb/>
            c. L. Pisonem, p. 13.) He made a voyage to Sicily, but for what <lb/>
            cause, or at what period of his life, is not stated. His closing years <lb/>
            were spent at Naples, whither he retired to avoid, as some think, the <lb/>
            effects of the hatred of those whom his Satire had offended; and <lb/>
            here he died, B. C. 103, in his forty-sixth year, and was honoured, <lb/>
            according to Eusebius, with a public funeral. He had a faithful <lb/>
            slave named Metrophanes, whose honesty and fidelity he rewarded <lb/>
            by writing an epitaph for his tomb, quoted by Martial as an instance <lb/>
            of antique and rugged style of writing, xi. Ep. 90. <lb/>
            “ Carmina nulla probas molli quw limite currant, <lb/>
            Sed quæ per salebras altaque saxa caduut: <lb/>
            Et tibi Mæonio res carmine major habetur <lb/>
            Luceili Columella heic situ' Metrophaues." <lb/>
            The name of his mistress is said to have been Collyra, to whom the <lb/>
            sixteenth book of his Satires was inscribed. He wrote thirty books <lb/>
            of Satires, of which the first twenty and the last are in Heroic <lb/>
            metre. The other nine in Iambics or Trochaics. He is not to be <lb/>
             <pb n="282"/>
            confounded with a comic poet of the same name, mentioned by the <lb/>
            Scholiast on Horace and by Fulgentius.</p>
          <p>Such is the traditional, and for a long time currently-believed, <lb/>
            story of Lucilius' life. The greater accuracy, or greater scepticism, <lb/>
            of modern scholars has called into question nearly every one of <lb/>
            these meagre facts. Even the method of spelling his name has <lb/>
            been a subject of fierce controversy. In the best manuscripts, <lb/>
            especially those of Horace, Cicero, and Nonius Marcellus, the name <lb/>
            of Lucilius is invariably spelt with one 1. Yet in spite of this <lb/>
            testimony, in order to square with some pre-conceived notions of <lb/>
            orthography, the I was doubled by Hadrian Turnebe, Claude de <lb/>
            Saumaise, Joseph Scaliger, Lambinus, Jos. Mercer, and Cortius. <lb/>
            The propriety, however, of omitting the second I has been fully <lb/>
            established by an appeal to MSS. and inscriptions ; and to Varges <lb/>
            and ElleDdt the credit is due of successfully restoring the correct <lb/>
            mode of spelling. (Cf. Rhenish Philolog. Museum for 1835, and <lb/>
            Ellendt on Cicero de Orat. iii. 43.)</p>
          <p>Again, his prænomen is by some stated to be Lucius; whereas, not <lb/>
            to mention others, Cicero and Quintilian always speak of him asCaius.</p>
          <p>But far more serious doubts, and with great probability, have <lb/>
            been cast upon the dates assigned by S. Hieronymus for his birth <lb/>
            and death. Bayle, in his Dictionary, was the first to suggest them ; <lb/>
            and they were taken up and urged with great zeal and learning by <lb/>
            Van Heusde, (in his Studia Critica in C. Lucilium Poetam, 1842,) <lb/>
            who accused Jerome of negligence and incorrectness in the dates he <lb/>
            assigns to many other events: e. g. the overthrow of Numantia, <lb/>
            the deaths of Plautus, Horace, Catullus, Lucretius, and Livius the <lb/>
            tragedian, and the birth of Messala Corvinus. The charge against <lb/>
            the chronographer has been repeated, and with some show of truth, <lb/>
            by Ritschel in the Rhenish Museum, 1843. Van Heusde's line of <lb/>
            argument is simply this, that the dates of Hieron. are inconsistent <lb/>
            with what Horace and Velleius say of Lucilius, and with what the <lb/>
            poet says of himself,-that it is absurd to suppose that a lad of <lb/>
            fifteen could have served as an eques; or that so young a person <lb/>
            would have been admitted to such intimate familiarity with men <lb/>
            like Scipio Africanus and Laelius ; and that at the time of Scipio's <lb/>
            death, when, as it is said, Lucilius had already gained a great reput­ <lb/>
            ation as a Satirist, he could have been barely over nineteen years <lb/>
            old; that if be had died at the age of forty-six, Horace would not <lb/>
            have applied to him the epithet " Senex,"—that the year of his <lb/>
            birth must be therefore carried back at least six years, and his death <lb/>
            assigned to a much later period, as he mentions the Leges Liciniæ <lb/>
            and Calpurnia, passed some years after the time fixed by Hieron. <lb/>
            for his death at Naples. In this view Milman coincides—" Notwith­ <lb/>
            standing the distinctness of this statement of S. Hieronymus, and <lb/>
            the ingenuity with which many writers have attempted to explain <lb/>
            it, it appears to me utterly irreconcilable with facts." (Personæ <lb/>
             <pb n="283"/>
            Horatianæ, p. 178.) Clinton also says,1 (F. H. ann. B. c. 103,) " The <lb/>
            expression of Horace, Sat. II. i. 34, by whom Lucilius is called <lb/>
            ‘ Senex,' implies that he lived to a later period."</p>
          <p>Such are the principal objections to the common accounts. Of <lb/>
            those who hold their accuracy, and endeavour to explain away the <lb/>
            difficulties attaching to them, the chief are Varges and Gerlach. The <lb/>
            principal points will be taken in the order in which they occur.</p>
          <p>With regard to the first, Varges shows, in opposition to Bayle, that <lb/>
            it was the custom for young Romans to serve long before the legal <lb/>
            age, either voluntarily, that they might apply themselves sooner to <lb/>
            civil matters, by getting over their period of military service ; or <lb/>
            compulsorily, to supply the waste of soldiers caused by the incessant <lb/>
            wars in which Rome was engaged. Hence the necessity for the law <lb/>
            of C. Gracchus to prevent enlistment under the age of seventeen. <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">νεώτερονἐτω̃ν ἐπτακαίδεκα μὴ καταλέγεσθαι στρατιώτην</foreign>.) Cf. Liv. <lb/>
            xxv. 5. Duk. ad Liv. xxvi. 25. As the equestrian service was <lb/>
            the more honourable, it was probably conceded to Lucilius on ac­ <lb/>
            count of bis gentle birth and early promise. Gerlach thinks that <lb/>
            Tibullus2 was only thirteen when he accompanied M. Valerius <lb/>
            Messalla Corvinus in his Aquitanian campaign. Now Tibullus <lb/>
            was only of squestrian family. There is no difficulty therefore in <lb/>
            supposing that Lucilius, who was of senatorian family, might have <lb/>
            served as eques at the age of fifteen.3</p>
          <p>As to the fact of Scipio and Lælius admitting him to their inti­ <lb/>
            mate friendship at so early an age, a parallel may be found in the case <lb/>
            of Archias the poet. Besides, Scipio and Lælius were the most likely <lb/>
            men to discover and to foster the early talent of the young poet. <lb/>
            For the fact of the intimacy we have the testimony of Horace, Sat. <lb/>
            II. i. 71, <lb/>
            " Quin ubi se a vulgo et scena in secreta remorant <lb/>
            Virtus Scipiadæ et mitis sapientia Lælî <lb/>
            Nugari cum illo et discincti ludere, donee <lb/>
            Decoqueretur olus, soliti." <note type="footnote"> 1 Clinton, in his new Epitome of Chronology, (Oxford, 1851,) says, Lu­ <lb/>
            cilius was about twenty years of age when serving at Numantia, B. c. 134. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 But Clinton thinks that the war for which Messalla triumphed was car­ <lb/>
            ried on B. c. 28, and that Tibullus was then about thirty. The war against <lb/>
            the Salassi had been carried on B. c. 34. Heyne assigns his birth to B. C. 49. <lb/>
            Voss, Passow, and Dissen, to B. C. 59. Lachman and Paldanus, to B. C. 54. <lb/>
            He is called a " juvenis" at his death, B. C. 18. But Clinton says there is <lb/>
            " no difficulty in this term, which may express forty years of age." </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Cf. Niebuhr's Lectures, vol. i. p. 316. " Slow and gradual advancement, <lb/>
            and a provision for officers in their old age, were things unknown to the <lb/>
            Romans. No one could by law have a permanent appointment: every one <lb/>
            had to give evidence of his ability. It was, moreover, not necessary to pass <lb/>
            through a long series of subordinate offices. A young Roman noble served <lb/>
            as eques, and the consul had in his cohort the most distinguished to act as <lb/>
            his staff: there they learned enough, and in a few years, a young man, in <lb/>
            the full vigour of life, became a tribune of the soldiers." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="284"/>
            On which the commentator says, " That the three were on such in­ <lb/>
            timate terms, that on one occasion Lælius was running round the <lb/>
            sofas in the Triclinium, while Lucilius was chasing him with a <lb/>
            twisted towel to hit him with." This story agrees exactly with the <lb/>
            description given by Cicero' (de Orat. ii. 6) of the conduct of Scipio <lb/>
            and Lælius, who speaks of their retiring together to the country- <lb/>
            house of the former, and to have descended, for the relaxation of <lb/>
            their minds, to the most childish amusements, such as gathering <lb/>
            shells on the shore of Caieta. Who would be more likely than <lb/>
            such men as these to be captivated by the precocious wit and pun­ <lb/>
            gent sarcasm of a sprightly lad ?</p>
          <p>Again, the character of Lucilius' compositions admits of eminence <lb/>
            at an earlier period of life than the other branches of poetry. And <lb/>
            yet Catullus and Propertius, not to mention many others, attained <lb/>
            great eminence as poets at a very early age ; certainly long before <lb/>
            their twentieth year.</p>
          <p>The Satiric poetry of Lucilius depending more on a keen per­ <lb/>
            ception of the ludicrous, and shrewd observation of passing events <lb/>
            and the foibles of individuals, would more readily win approbation <lb/>
            at an early age, than compositions whose excellence would consist <lb/>
            in the display of judgment, knowledge of the world, and elaborate <lb/>
            finish. There is therefore no reason to suppose that his talent may <lb/>
            not, like that of Cicero, have been developed at an early age, and <lb/>
            having come under the notice, might have won the approbation, of <lb/>
            men of such character in private life as Scipio and Lælius are re­ <lb/>
            ported to have been.</p>
          <p>But Horace calls him " senex," ii. Sat. 28, seq. <lb/>
            " Ille (Lucilius) velut fidis arcana sodalibus olim <lb/>
            Credebat libris : neque si male cesserat, unquam <lb/>
            Decurrens alio, neque si bene, quo fit ut omnis <lb/>
            Votiva pateat veluti descripta tabella <lb/>
            Vita Senis—" <lb/>
            To this it is answered : nothing can be more loose and vague than <lb/>
            the employment by Roman writers of terms relating to the different <lb/>
            periods of human life : e. g. " puer, adolescentulus, adolescens, <lb/>
            juvenis, senex." We have seen that Tibullus at the age of forty <lb/>
            may be called "juvenis." Hannibal, at the age of forty-four, (i. e. <lb/>
            two years younger than Lucilius at his death,) calls himself senex. <lb/>

            Persius (Sat. i. 124) calls Aristophanes " prægrandis senex," though, <lb/>
            as Ranke shows in his Life, (p. xc.,) he was not of great age. We <lb/>
            might add that Horace himself uses the phrase, " poetarum seni­ <unclear/> <lb/>
            eram turba," (i. Sat. x. 67,) as equivalent to priorum.</p>
          <p>In the fourth Fragment of the twentieth book, Lucilius mentions <lb/>
            the Calpurnian Law. <lb/>
            " Calpurnî sævam legem Pisoni' reprendi <lb/>
            Eduxique animam in primoribu' naribus." <lb/>
            This Van Heusde holds to be the Lex Calpurnia, de ambitu, passed <lb/>
            by C. Calpurnius Piso, when consul, A. U. c. 687, B. c. 67, at which <lb/>
            time Lucilius would have been eighty-one years old. But there <lb/>
            was another Lex Calpurnia, de pecuniis repetundis, passed by L. <lb/>
            Calpurnius Piso, tribune, in A. u. c. 604, n. c. 150. Van Heusde <lb/>
            says the former must be meant, because Lucilius applies to it the <lb/>
            epithet sceva, and Cicero (pro Muræna, c. 46) also styles it "seve­ <lb/>
            rissime scriptam." He explains the second line of the Fragment to <lb/>
            mean, that Lucilius " all but paid the penalty of death for his ani­ <lb/>
            madversions of the law," but these words more correctly imply the <lb/>
            fierce snorting of an angry man." So Pers. Sat. v. 91, "Ira <lb/>
            cadat naso." Varro, R. R. ii. 3, 5, " Spiritum naribus ducere." <lb/>
            Mart. vi. Ep. 64, " Rabido nec perditus ore fumantem nasum vivi <lb/>
            tentaveris ursi." And any law whatever would be naturally termed <lb/>
            "sæva" by him who came under the influence of it.</p>
          <p>In the 132nd of the Fragmenta Incerta, we have (quoted from <lb/>
            A. Cell. Noct. Att. ii. 24) these words, " Legem vitemus Licini." <lb/>
            The object of this law was to give greater sanction to the provisions <lb/>
            of the Lex Fannia, a sumptuary law, which had become nearly <lb/>
            obsolete. If passed by P. Licinius Crassus Dives Lusitanicus, when <lb/>
            consul, it must be referred to the year A. U. c. 657, B. c. 97, six <lb/>
            years after the supposed date of Lucilius' death. But there is no <lb/>
            reason why this law should not have been passed by Licinius when <lb/>
            tribune or præto?-, as well as when consul; probably during his <lb/>
            prætorship, as nearer the consulship, though Pighius, (Annal. iii. <lb/>
            122,) though without giving any authority, assigns it to his tri­ <lb/>
            buneship.</p>
          <p>The Orchian Law was passed by C. Orchius when tribune. The <lb/>
            Fannian and many other sumptuary laws were passed by prætors <lb/>
            or tribunes. The argument therefore derived from the law having <lb/>
            been passed by Licinius, when consul, falls to the ground.</p>
          <p>Allowing, however, that Lucilius was alive during the consul­ <lb/>
            ship of Licinius, we have the incidental, and therefore more valua­ <lb/>
            ble, testimony of Cicero that he must have died very shortly after. <lb/>
            In his " De Oratore," he introduces the speakers in the Dialogue <lb/>
            quoting Lucilius, as one evidently not very recently dead. Now <lb/>
            this imaginary Dialogue is supposed to have taken place B. c. 91.</p><pb n="286"/>

          <p>To the first book there is said to have been annexed an Epistle to L. AElius <lb/>
            Stilo, the friend of the poet, to whom in all probability this book was <lb/>
            dedicated. (Fr. 16.) We know from a note of Servius on the tenth book <lb/>
            of the Æneid, (1. 104,) that the subject was a council of gods held to de­ <lb/>
            liberate on the fortune of the Roman state ; the result of the conference <lb/>
            being, that nothing but the death of certain obnoxious individuals could <lb/>
            possibly rescue the city from plunging headlong into ruin. It is a kind of <lb/>
            parody on the council of Celestials held in the first book of the Odyssey, to <lb/>
            discuss the propriety of the return of Ulysses to Greece: and as Homer <lb/>
            represents Neptune, the great enemy of Ulysses, to have been absent <lb/>
            from the meeting, so here (Fr. 2) we find an allusion to some previous <lb/>
            council, at which Jupiter, by the machinations of Juno, (Fr. 15,) was not <lb/>
            present. Virgil, as Servius says, borrowed the idea of his discussion be­ <lb/>
            tween Venus, Juno, and Jupiter, from this book; only he translated the <lb/>
            language of Lucilius into a type more suited to the dignity of Heroic <lb/>
            verse. Lucilius's council begin with discussing the affairs of mankind at <lb/>
            large, and theu proceed to consider the best method of prolonging the <lb/>
            Roman state, (Fr. 5,) which has no greater enemies than its own corrupt <lb/>
            and licentious morals, and the wide-spreading evils of avarice and luxury. <lb/>
            But amidst the growing vices which undermined the state, must especially <lb/>
            be reckoned the study of a spurious kind of philosophy, of rhetoric, and <lb/>
            logic, which not only was the cause of universal indolence and neglect of <lb/>
            all serious duties, but also led men to lay snares to entrap their neighbours. <lb/>
            (Fr. inc. 2.) A fair instance of these sophistical absurdities is given (Fr. <lb/>
            inc. 12) ; and the doctrine of the Stoics, to which Horace alludes, (i. Sat. <lb/>
            iii. 124,) is also ridiculed. (Fr. inc. 23.) The pernicious effects of gold <lb/>
            are then described, as destructive of all honesty, good faith, and every <lb/>
            religious principle (Fr. inc. 39—47) ; the result of which is, that the state <lb/>
            is fast sinking into helpless ruin. (Fr. inc. 50.) Nor are the evils of luxury <lb/>
            less baleful. (Fr. 19—21.)</p>
          <p>All this discussion, in the previous conference, had been nugatory on account <lb/>
            of the absence of Jupiter, and the divisions that had arisen amongst the <lb/>
            gods themselves. In this debate Neptune had taken a very considerable <lb/>
            part, since we hear that, discussing some very abstruse and difficult point, <lb/>
            he said, it could not be cleared up, even though Orcus were to permit <lb/>
            Carneades himself to revisit earth. (Fr. 8.) Apollo also was probably <lb/>
            one of the speakers, and expressed a particular dislike to his cognomen of <lb/>
            " the Beautiful." (Fr. inc. 144.) Perhaps all the gods but Jove (Fr. 3) <lb/>
            had been present; but as they could not agree, the whole matter was re­ <lb/>
            ferred to Jupiter; who, expressing his vexation that he was not present <lb/>
            at the first meeting, blames some and praises others. (Fr. 55, inc.) The <note type="footnote"> 1 Book I. Some of the commentators suppose that the thirty Satires of Lucilius <lb/>
            were divided into two books, and that the first of these books, and not the first Satire <lb/>
            only, was dedicated to Ælius Stilo. - </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="287"/>
            cause of his absence was probably the same as that described (Iliad xiv. <lb/>
            307—327) by Homer; which passage Lueilius probably meant to ridicule. <lb/>
            (Fr. 15.) The result of the deliberation is a determination on the part of <lb/>
            the gods, that the only way to save the Roman state is by requiring the <lb/>
            expiatory sacrifice of the most flagitious and impious amongst the citizens; <lb/>
            and the three fixed upon are, P. Cornelius Lentulus Lupus, L. Papirius <lb/>

            This book must have been published subsequently to the death of Carneades, <lb/>

          <p>On the subject of this book the commentators differ; some supposing that <lb/>
            it was directed against luxury and effeminacy. But the avarice and <lb/>
            licentiousness of the times form a considerable portion of the writings of <lb/>
            Lucilius, and there are very few of his Satires in which these are not in­ <lb/>
            cidentally glanced at. From the sixth Fragment, which after all is a very <lb/>
            obscure one, Ellendt supposed it was written to expose Æmilius Scaurus. <lb/>
            Corpet maintains that it contained the description of a sanguinary brawl, <lb/>
            in which many persons were engaged; that one person was taken up for <lb/>
            dead, his house purified, (Fr. 22,) and all preparations made for his funeral, <lb/>
            when some one saw another lying in his bier. Fr. 1. It is quite clear that <lb/>
            Fr. 14, 24, and perhaps 2, refer to luxury; if by Manlius, in the second <lb/>
            Fragment, is intended Cn. Manlius Vulso. (Vid. note.)</p>
          <p>1 ... whom, when Hortensius and Posthumius had seen ; <lb/>
            the rest, too, saw that he was not on his bier, and that <lb/>
            another was lying there.</p>
          <p>2 Hostilius ... against the plague and ruin which that <lb/>
            halting Manlius, too, [introduced among] us.</p>
          <p>3 .. which were all removed in two hours, when the sun <lb/>
            set, and was enveloped in darkness.</p>
          <p>4 ... that he, having been ill-treated, attacked the other's <lb/>
            jaws, and beat the breath out of him.</p>
          <p>5 Now for the name: next I will tell you what I have got <lb/>
            out of the witnesses, by questioning. <note type="footnote"> 2. There are two persons of the name of Hostilius mentioned by Livy, <lb/>
            as contemporary with Cn. Manlius Vulso. Hostilius is Gerlach's reading <lb/>
            for the old hostilibus. Cn. Manlius got the nickname of Vulso from <lb/>
            vellendo, plucking out superfluous hairs to make his body more delicate. <lb/>
            (Plin. xiv. 20. Juv. viii. 114; ix. 14. Pers. iv. 36.) He was consul <lb/>
            B. c. 189, and marched into Gallo-Græcia, and for his conquests was <lb/>
            allowed a triumph, B. c. 186. Livy enters into great detail in describing <lb/>
            all the various luxuries which he introduced into Rome ; such as sofas, <lb/>
            tables, sideboards, rich and costly vestments and hangings, foreign mu­ <lb/>
            sicians, &amp;c. Liv. xxxix. 6. Plin. H. N. xxxiv. 3, 8. Cf. Bekker's <lb/>
            Gallus, p. 294. Catax (quasi cadax a cadendo) is explained by coxo, <lb/>
            " one lame of the hip." There is probably an allusion to his effeminacy. <lb/>
            Carpet considers Manlius Verna to be intended, who had the sobriquet <lb/>
            of Pantolabus, i. e. " grasp-all." </note><note type="footnote"> 3. Leg. obducto tenebris. Dusa's conjecture, adopted by Gerlach. </note><note type="footnote"> 5. Exsculpo. So Fr. incert. 49, " Esurienti Leoni ex ore exsculpere </note> <pb n="291"/>

            line. Ellendt (vid. sup.) supposes Æmilius Scaurus to be meant; others, <lb/>

            was conducted to the forum, for which he was ridiculed by Appius Clau­ <lb/>

            as Gerlach says, it may apply equally well to Scipio Nasica, or Opimius, <lb/>

            Africanus, who went voluntarily into exile. </note><note type="footnote"> 8. Cf. Ter. Andr. V. vi. 12, " Tuns est nunc Chremes." Gerlach's read­ <lb/>

            suspended lights over their doors or cells. (Juv. vi. 122. Hor. ii. Sat. <lb/>

          <p>We have not only much more ample and satisfactory information respecting <lb/>
            the subject of this Satire from ancient writers, but the Fragments which <lb/>
            have come down to us give sufficient evidence that their statements are <lb/>
            correct. It is the description of a journey which Lucilius took from Rome <lb/>
            to Capua, and thence to the Straits of Messina; with an account of some <lb/>
            of the halting-places on his route, and incidents of travel. Besides this, <lb/>
            which was the main subject, he indulged by the way in a little pleasing <lb/>
            raillery against some of his contemporaries, Ennius, Pacuvius, Cæcilius, <lb/>
            and Terence, according to the old Scholiast. This Satire formed the <lb/>
            model from which Horace copied his Journey to Brundusium, i. Sat. v. <lb/>
            The special points of imitation will be seen in the notes ; from which it <lb/>
            will appear that the particular incidents mentioned by Horace, are probably <lb/>
            fictitious. As to the journey itself, Varges and Gerlach are both of opinion <lb/>
            that it was a real one, and undertaken solely for purposes of pleasure ; as <lb/>
            it was not unusual for the wealthier Romans of that day to travel into <lb/>
            Campania, or even to Lucania, and as far as the district of the Bruttii. (Cf. <lb/>
            Hor. i. Sat. vi. 102, seq.) These journeys were occasionally performed on <lb/>
            foot: as we hear of Cato travelling on foot through the different cities of <lb/>
            Italy, bearing his own arms, and attended only by a single slave, who carried <lb/>
            his baggage and libation-cup for sacrificing. But Lucilius probably on this <lb/>
            occasion had his hackney, (canterius,) like Horace, which carried not only <lb/>
            his master's saddle-bags, but himself also. (Cf. Fr. 9. Hor. i. Sat. vi 104.) <lb/>
            It is not quite clear whether the scene described at Capua was a gladiatorial <lb/>
            exhibition, or merely a drunken brawl that took place in the streets, from <lb/>
            which one of the parties came very badly off. <note type="footnote"> 24. Lurco is derived by some from <foreign xml:lang="grc">λαυ̃ρος</foreign>, " voracious;" but by Festus <lb/>
            from Lura, an old word for " the belly." Cf. Plaut. Pers. III. in. 16, <lb/>
            " Lurco, edax, furax, fugax." Lurco was the cognomen of M. Aufidius, <lb/>
            who first introduced the art of fattening peacocks, by which he made a <lb/>
            large fortune. Varro, R. R. iii. 6. Plin. x. 20, 23. </note><note type="footnote"> 25. Inhospita tesqua. Horace has copied this sentiment in his epistle <lb/>
            to his Villicus, " Nam quæ deserta et inhospita tesqua credis, amæna <lb/>
            vocat mecum qui sentit." i. Ep. xiv. 19. Tesqua is derived from <foreign xml:lang="grc">δάσ­ <lb/>
            κιος</foreign>, " very wooded." (Lucan, vi. 41, " nemorosa tesca.") Varro says <lb/>
            tesca are " places enclosed and set apart as templa for the purposes of <lb/>
            augury." L. L. vi. 2. </note> <lb/>

            the quantity of wells there. It became the great emporium of commerce, <lb/>
            as Delos had been before, and hence was called Delos Minor. It was a <lb/>
            Greek colony, and was called Dicæarcheia, from the strict justice with <lb/>
            which its government was administered, or from the name of its founder. <lb/>

          <p>The Scholiast, on the third Satire of Persius, tells us that the subject of that <lb/>
            Satire, which is directed against the luxury and vices of the rich, was <lb/>
            borrowed from the fourth book of Lucilius. In all probability the form <lb/>
            of the Satire is not the same; as the dialogue between the severe censor <lb/>
            and his pupils approaches too near the Greek form, to have suited the taste <lb/>
            of Lucilius. No doubt there is a much closer imitation in the second Satire <lb/>
            of Horace's second book, which also was confessedly composed upon this <lb/>
            model; where the plain and rustic simplicity of Ofella takes the place of <lb/>
            the grave and sententious philosophy of the more dignified Lælius. The <lb/>
            first six Fragments are evidently to be referred to Lselius ; expatiating on <lb/>
            the praises of frugality, and exhibiting, by examples, the hollowness of all <lb/>
            the pleasures of luxury and gluttony. We have then allusions to a combat <lb/>
            of gladiators; and several references to women, and to the impetuous and <lb/>
            restless anxieties attendant upon the passion of love ; which are incon­ <lb/>
            sistent with the character of Lælius, and were therefore put into the mouth <lb/>
            of some other speaker.</p>
          <p>To the first part of the Satire we may probably refer the Fragments, 192, <lb/>
            193, 132, 133, incert.</p>

            thou art!" he says. “ Thou hast never in all thy life <lb/>

            with the Coan wines, which possessed the same properties. Cf. Hor. ii. <lb/>

            larger fish. Vid. Hor. ii. Sat. viii. 42, " Affertur squillas inter muræna <lb/>
            natantes," which Orell. explains as a conger served up with crabs. The <lb/>

            Salinas. Ex. Plin. 1316: but what it really was is not known. It was <lb/>
            a royal fish, like the sturgeon, (Mart. xiii. Ep. 91,) and when brought to <lb/>
            table, was ushered in with great solemnities ; the servant who bore it had <lb/>
            a chaplet round his head, and was preceded by another playing the flute. <lb/>
            Publius Gallonins, the præco, is said to have been the first who intro­ <lb/>
            duced this luxury. Macrob. Sat. ii. 12. In Pliny's time, however, he <lb/>

            is here used for " the pike that battens on the rich products of the Ro­ <lb/>
            man cloacæ.” (Macrob. Sat. ii. 12.) The Roman epicures distin­ <lb/>
            guished between three different kinds of the Tiber pike (lupus Tiber­ <lb/>
            inus). The worst were those caught quite out at sea; the second best, <lb/>
            those caught at Ostia at the river's mouth ; the finest of all were those <lb/>

            v. 30. For the use of snow in cooling wine, see note to Juv. v. 50. <lb/>
            This wine has lost none of its strength by mixing it with snow, and none <lb/>
            of its flavour from having been filtered through the strainer. (Cf. Plin. <lb/>
            H. N. xiv. 27. Hor. ii. Sat. iv. 51, seq.) A great difficulty with the <lb/>
            ancients seems to have been to clear their wine of the lees; some of the <lb/>
            methods are mentioned in the passage of Horace just quoted. Eggs <lb/>
            were also used for the same purpose. Besides this the wine was poured <lb/>
            through a colum and saccus vinarius. The former was a kind of metal <lb/>
            sieve, of which numbers have been found at Pompeii. The latter was <lb/>
            a filter-bag of linen. (Hence " integrum perdunt lino vitiata saporem." <lb/>
            Hor. u. s.) The usual plan was to fill both the colum and saccus with <lb/>
            snow, and then to pour the wine over it; and with this view the snow <lb/>
            was carefully preserved till summer, as is still done at Naples. (Hence <lb/>
            " æstivæ nives." Mart. v. Ep. lxiv. 2.) Nero's invention of using water <lb/>
            that had been boiled and afterwards frozen, as a substitute for snow, has <lb/>
            been already alluded to. This process also served to moderate the in­ <lb/>
            toxicating power of the stronger wines ; hence the phrases " cast rare, <lb/>

          <p>The person to whom this book is addressed, is supposed by Sealiger to have <lb/>
            been a professor of the art of rhetoric. Lucilius complains that this friend, <lb/>
            though he knew he had been ill, had never come to see him ; and at the <lb/>
            same time he ridicules the affected and pedantie style of language then in <lb/>
            vogue in the schools of the rhetoricians. He then glances slightly at the <lb/>
            fickleness and inconstancy of his friend's attachment, contrasting the pre­ <lb/>
            sent state of his feelings with his staunch friendship in former days; at the <lb/>
            same time assuring him that his own heart remains unchanged. He ad­ <lb/>
            mits, however, that there is some ground for excuse for this disappointment <lb/>
            of his hopes, as even the good Tiresias of yore was occasionally found <lb/>
            tripping. (Fr. 10.) The causes which lead to breach of friendship are <lb/>
            then discussed, the chief of which is avarice, that lust of gold, that nothing <lb/>
            can satiate; while, meantime, the people are lacking the common neces­ <lb/>
            saries of life. With avarice, ambition springs up ; as sure a divider of <lb/>
            faithful hearts as avarice itself. Yet Lælius, that true-hearted and single- <lb/>
            minded man, could hold the highest offices of state, without losing his <lb/>
            integrity of heart, or sacrificing the simplicity of his rugged virtues. This <note type="footnote"> 15. Pessulus was the peg or bolt by which the fastening of the door <lb/>
            was secured on the inside. It probably refers to a lover effecting a forci­ <lb/>
            ble entrance into his mistress's house. Cf. Hor. i. Od. xxv. 1 ; iii. Od. <lb/>
            xxvi. 7, where Horace enumerates vectes amongst the weapons of a lover's <lb/>
            warfare. Cf. Lucil. xxix. Fr. 47, " Vecte atque ancipiti ferro effringam <lb/>
            cardines." </note><note type="footnote"> 19. Cf. Cels. ii. 15. </note> <lb/>

            treachery, however, is gradual in its growth. (Fr. 3.) At first a large <lb/>
            bribe alone has power to sever the bonds of friendship ; yet soon they give <lb/>
            way before the most paltry inducement. Yet such is the infatuation and <lb/>
            gross folly of men, that they even aim at deceiving the gods themselves by <lb/>
            an affectation of piety. With this depraved state of morals he contrasts <lb/>
            the frugal simplicity of ancient days, describing by the way the plain and <lb/>
            homely elements that composed their forefathers' rustic meal. There is <lb/>
            supposed to be also an allusion in this book to one Q. Metellus Caprarius; <lb/>
            a man who proved the worthlessness of his character, both during his ad­ <lb/>
            ministration as prætor, and afterwards when serving in the camp before <lb/>
            Numantia. (Fr. 11, 23, 20, 21, 22, Gerl.) Horace had perhaps part of this <lb/>
            Satire in view, when he wrote his first Satire of the first book; especially <lb/>
            where he mentions avarice as one of the causes which make men discon­ <lb/>
            tented with their lot in life. Very similar sentiments to those expressed <lb/>
            in this book, may be found in Sallust also. (Bell. Cat. c. xii. init.)</p>

            not bear out of his sight, and from which no earthly power can tear him <lb/>
            away, (Fr. 1, 2,) the miserable appliances of his scanty furniture, and the <lb/>
            absence of any thing approaching to luxury. or even comfort, form the first <lb/>

            the manners of the nobles. Their insolent disregard of the feelings of others, <lb/>
            (Fr. 4,) their unbridled licentiousness, their arrogance of look and bearing, <lb/>

          <p>The general subject of the book seems to be agreed upon by all commentators, <lb/>
            though they differ as to the details. Schoenbeck says it is directed against <lb/>
            the lusts of women ; particularly the occasions where those lusts had most <lb/>
            opportunity of being exhibited and gratified, the festivals of the Matron­ <lb/>
            alia and the kindred Saturnalia. Petermann considers that it refers simply <note type="footnote"> (Hor. i. Sat. ii. 98, " a cinere flando," Acron. in loc.,) "the slave who <lb/>

            to the intercourse between husbands and wives, in which view Dousa seems <lb/>
            to coincide. Duentzer takes a wider view, and says it refers to all licen­ <lb/>
            tious pleasures. Van Heusde leaves the matter undecided. Gerlach coin­ <lb/>
            cides with the general view, but supposes that the passions and the quarrels <lb/>
            alluded to, must be referred to slaves, or at all events persons of the lowest <lb/>
            station; for whom festivals, like the Segellaria, (alluded to in Fr. 4,) were <lb/>
            more particularly intended.-The first two Fragments evidently describe <lb/>
            a matrimonial brawl. The tenth, eleventh, and twelfth, refer to an <lb/>
            unhallowed passion. The fifth, sixth, and thirteenth, to the unnatural <lb/>
            and effeminate refinements practised by a class of persons too often re­ <lb/>
            ferred to in Juvenal and Persius. The fifteenth, to the fastidious taste of <lb/>
            those who professed to be judges of such matters. The connexion of the <lb/>
            seventh Fragment is uncertain, as it applies apparently to rewards for <lb/>
            military service.</p>

            at Samos, as at Corinth, Athens, and Ægina, formed a considerable por­ <lb/>

            the festival of the Sigillaria. (Auson. Eel. de Per. Rom. 32, " Sacra <lb/>
            Sigillorum nomine dicta colunt.") The Saturnalia were originally held <lb/>
            on the 19th of December, (xiv. Kal. Jan.,) and lasted for one day only. <lb/>
            They were instituted B. c. 497, (Liv. ii. 21 ; xxii. 1,) and were intended <lb/>
            to commemorate the golden days of Saturn, when slavery was unknown ; <lb/>
            hence slaves were waited on by their masters, who wore a short robe, <lb/>
            called the Synthesis, for that purpose. It was a time of general festivity <lb/>
            and rejoicing; and presents were interchanged between friends. The <lb/>
            festival was afterwards extended to three days by an edict of Julius Cæsar, <lb/>
            which Augustus confirmed ; and, commencing on the 17th, terminated on <lb/>
            the 19th. (Macrob. Sat. i. 10.) Caligula added two more days, (or one <lb/>
            at least, Suet. Cal. 17,) which custom Claudius revived when it had fallen <lb/>
            into desuetude. Then the Sigillaria were added, so that the period of <lb/>
            festivity was extended to seven days. Mart. xiv. Ep. 72. The Sigillaria </note></p><pb n="310"/>

            more barbarous ages. Macrob. u. s.) The name was applied to the little <lb/>

            unlawful love to have been the theme, and that the ancient title of the book <lb/>
            countenanced this opinion.-The second, fourth, fifth, eleventh, and thir­ <lb/>

          <p>The subject of the ninth book is known from several notices in the old <lb/>
            grammarians.* It is said to have contained strictures on the orthography <lb/>
            of the ancient writers ; some emendations of the verses of Accius and En­ <lb/>
            nius, (with especial reference to the former, who is said to have always used <lb/>
            double vowels to express a long syllable,) and a mention of the double <lb/>
            genius, who, according to the notion of Euclides the Socratic, attends upon <lb/>
            each individual of the human race. The exact connexion of this latter <lb/>
            topic with the foregoing, is not at present evident to us. It appears that <lb/>
            this book had anciently the title of " Fornix," as the work of Pomponius <lb/>
            on a cognate subject was called “ Marsyas.”Van Heusde supposes that <lb/>
            it took its name from the Fabian arch on the Via Sacra, and that its sub­ <lb/>
            ject resembled the ninth of Horace's first book of Satires. The poet, in his <lb/>
            walk along the Via Sacra, meets with a troublesome fellow near the arch <lb/>
            of Fabius, who pesters him with a speech which he is about to deliver, as <lb/>
            defendant in a cause, and which he wishes Lucilius to look over and cor­ <lb/>
            rect ; and that this furnishes the poet with the groundwork for a discussion <lb/>
            on several points in grammar, orthography, and rhetoric. With this view <lb/>
            Gerlach so far agrees, as to suppose the subject of both Horace's and Lu­ <lb/>
            cilius's Satires to have been similar ; especially since many similar phrases <lb/>
            and sentiments occur in both ; but he considers a detailed disquisition on <lb/>
            single letters and syllables, inconsistent with a desultory conversation, or <note type="footnote"> 10. Posticum, Nonius makes equivalent to Sella. Gerlach, however, <lb/>

            ticularly, since many other Fragments of this book have come down to us, <lb/>
            wholly irreconcilable with this view of the subject; some referring to <lb/>
            avarice, others to the Salii; which though they might certainly be inci­ <lb/>

            write it in one and the same fashion, “Pacem, Plăcide, <lb/>

            " tumor inguinis." Gerlach inclines to the latter interpretation. Schmidt <lb/>
            supposes Lucilius to employ the metaphor of weaving to express the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing sentiment: " as the outer surface of the woof is of little conse­ <lb/>
            quence if the inner part be good, so, provided a man's internal qualities, <lb/>
            the virtues of his heart and head, are all that we can desire, it matters <lb/>
            little what the outer integument is that shrouds this fair inside :” and <lb/>
            that to this Horace alludes, ii. Sat. i. 63, " Lucilius ausus Primus in hunc <lb/>
            operis componere carmina morem Detrahere et pellem nitidus quâ quisque <lb/>
            per ora Cedcret introrsumturpis." (Lucilii Satyrarum quæ de lib. ix. <lb/>
            supersunt disposita, c. L. F. Schmidt, p. 40.) But Gerlach thinks that <lb/>
            panus could not be used to express pellis. </note><note type="footnote"> 2. This, we learn from Terentianus, is a criticism on Accius, who used <lb/>
            to mark long syllables by doubling the vowels, which Lucilius considers <lb/>
            a fault, there being no more necessity in Latin to mark the quantity by <lb/>
            the orthography than in Greek, where, though the length of the vowel be <lb/>
            changed, as in <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄϱεςἄϱες</foreign>, the spelling remains unaltered. Of. Horn. II. <lb/>

          <p>5 But it is of great consequence whether ABBITERE have <lb/>
            a D or B—</p>
          <p>6 "Now come PUEREI." Put E and I at the end, to <lb/>
            make " pueri " the plural; if you put I only, as Pupilll, <lb/>
            Puerl, Luceill, this will become the singular number. <lb/>
            " Hoc illi factum est unI." Being singular, you will put <lb/>
            I only. " Hoc IllEI fecere" Add E to mark the plural. <lb/>
            Add also E to MendacEI and FurEI, when you make it <lb/>
            the dative case. " MEIle hominum, duo MEIlia." Here <lb/>
            too we must have both vowels, MEIles, MEIlitiam. Pila, <lb/>
            " a ball to play with," Pilum, " a pestle to pound with," <lb/>
            will have I simply. But to PEIla, "javelins," you must <lb/>
            add E, to give the fuller sound.</p>
          <p>7 Our S, and what after a semi-Greek fashion we call Sigma, <lb/>
            admits of no mistake.</p>
          <p>8 ... in the word PeLLiciendo. <lb/>
            9 For just as we see Intro (within) to be a very different <lb/>
            word from Intus, (inside,) so apud se is very different <lb/>
            from, and has not the same force as, ad se. " A man in­ <lb/>

            keeps himself at home, inside his own house (intus <lb/>

          <p>10 " The water boils," may be expressed by Fervit (of the <lb/>

          <p>The old Scholiast, in his Life of Persius, tells us that " after he had quitted <lb/>
            school, and the instruction of his tutors, he was so much struck with the <lb/>
            tenth book of the Satires of Lucilius, that he was seized with a vehement <lb/>
            desire of writing Satire, and immediately applied himself to the imitation <lb/>
            of this book, and after first detracting from his own merits, proceeded to <lb/>
            disparage the poetical attempts of others." Van Heusde supposes that the <lb/>
            book contained a detailed account of the life of Lucilius; and hence the <lb/>
            saying of the Scholiast, that " the whole life of Lucilius was as distinctly <lb/>
            known as if it had been portrayed in pictures." (So Horace says, Sat. II. <lb/>
            i. 30,) " Quo fit ut omnis Votivà pateat veluti descripta tabella Vita senis." <lb/>
            He conjectures the difference between the subjects of the ninth and tenth <lb/>
            books to have been this : that in the ninth, Lucilius criticised the ignorance <lb/>
            and corrected the mistakes of the Librarii; i. e. those who copied the com­ <lb/>
            positions of the poets, only incidentally, and by the way, touching on the <lb/>
            poets themselves. Whereas the tenth was intended directly as an attack <lb/>
            upon the poets who preceded him. Jahn, in his prolegomena on Persius, <lb/>
            imagines this imitation of the tenth book to have been carried further <lb/>
            than we are perhaps justified in assuming ; he conjectures that the lion­ <lb/>

            This opinion he fortifies by two quotations, one from Petronius, Sat. iv., <lb/>
            the other from Apuleius, de Deo Soer. p. 364. In this view Gerlach docs <lb/>
            not coincide, though he is disposed to admit that Lucilius in all probability <lb/>
            began the book with a disparagement of himself, and so far furnished an <lb/>
            example for Persius to imitate. It is a question that must remain doubt­ <lb/>
            ful, and is of no great importance. It is, however, also clear that this <lb/>

          <p>Schoenbeck supposes this book to have been written in memory of the Ibe­ <lb/>
            rian war; because it not only touches on military affairs, but contains also <lb/>
            some bitter sarcasms on the morals of certain young men, who served in <lb/>
            that campaign. Petermann coincides in the same opinion. Corpet sup­ <lb/>
            poses that the principal object of the book, was an elaborate defence of the <lb/>
            character of Scipio Africanus; especially with regard to the salutary and <lb/>
            strict discipline which he restored to the Roman army during the Numan­ <lb/>
            tine war. Gerlach admits the probability of these conjectures, though he <lb/>
            scarcely thinks that the Fragments which have come down to us of this <lb/>
            book, are of sufficient length to enable us to pronounce definitively on the <lb/>
            question. It is quite clear that the mention of Opimius the father, or of <lb/>
            the elder Lucius Cotta, can bear no relation to the Numantine war, since <lb/>
            they both lived before it began ; still it is possible that their names might <lb/>
            have been introduced, to render the morals of their sons still more con­ <lb/>
            spicuous. How the Fragment (2) respecting the plebeian Caius Cassius <lb/>
            Cephalo was connected with the main subject, is not clear; unless he was <lb/>
            introduced for the purpose of incidentally mentioning the bribery of the <lb/>
            unjust judge, Tullius.</p>
          <p>The fourth and ninth Fragments may clearly refer to the Numantine war; <lb/>
            as may perhaps the seventh; as we learn from Cicero, that while Scipio <lb/>
            Africanus was before Numantia, he received some munificent presents, <lb/>
            which were sent to him from Asia by king Attalus, and which he ac­ <lb/>
            cepted in the presence of his army. (Cic. pro Dei, 7.) This happened <lb/>
            probably only a few months before the death of Attains ; and Lucilius was <lb/>
            most likely an eyewitness of the fact. The thirteenth Fragment also may <lb/>
            refer to the same campaign; though Diintzer supposes it to be an allusion <lb/>
            to the miserable penurionsness of Ælius Tubero. The fifth and sixth <lb/>
            Fragments apparently refer rather to civil than military matters.</p>
          <p>1 QUINTUS Opimius, the famous father of this Jugurthinus, <lb/>
            was both a handsome man and an infamous, both in his <lb/>
            early youth ; latterly he conducted himself more uprightly. <note type="footnote"> 7. Of. Donat. in Terent. Andr. II. i. 24. </note><note type="footnote"> 1. Jugurthinus is properly the proud title of Marius. (Ov. Pont. IV. <lb/>

            heir ; while all the rest were disinherited.</p>
          <p>3 Lucius Cotta the elder, the father of this Crassus, " the <lb/>
            all-blazing," was a close-fisted fellow in money-matters; <lb/>

            tinguished by the taking of Fregellae, when in rebellion against Rome, <lb/>
            while he was prætor. The safety of the Roman state had also been com­ <lb/>
            mitted to him when consul, (B. c. 121,) during the riots of Cains Grac­ <lb/>
            chus, which by his prompt measures he was the main instrument in <lb/>
            quelling. (Hence Cicero styles him " civis præstantissimus." Brut. 34.) <lb/>
            For this he was accused by the democratic party, but was acquitted; <lb/>
            his defence being conducted by the same Papirius Carbo who had as­ <lb/>
            sailed Scipio Africanus after the death of Tiberius Gracchus ; (" alia turn <lb/>
            mente Rempublicam capessens." Cic. de Or. ii. 25.) The partisans of <lb/>
            Gracchus, however, afterwards crushed him by means of the Mamilian <lb/>
            law, along with many other excellent men. Cic. Brut. u. s. Sail. Bell. <lb/>
            Jug. 40. He was consul with Q. Fabius Maximus, who that year over­ <lb/>
            threw the Allobroges and Arverni. His consulship was long remembered <lb/>
            as having been a splendid year for wine, hence called Opimianum. Cic. <lb/>
            Brut. 83. Of his father Quintus, Cicero speaks in nearly the same terms <lb/>
            as Lucilius does here : " Q. Opimius, consularis, qui adolescentulus malè <lb/>
            audisset." De Orat. ii. 68. </note><note type="footnote"> 2. Cephalo, like Capito, was probably a nickname from the size of his <lb/>

            Why it was given to this Cotta is not known. Gerlach supposes him to <lb/>
            be the L. Cotta mentioned by Cicero, (de Orat. iii. 11,) as affecting a <lb/>
            coarse and rustic style of speaking, " gaudere videtur gravitate linguæ, <lb/>
            sonoque vocis agresti," and that this name was given him by way of <lb/>
            irony. He would be most justly entitled to the epithet of Crassus, " the <lb/>
            coarse," which was probably given for the same reason. (Crassus not <lb/>
            being the regular cognomen of the Aurelian gens, to which Cotta be­ <lb/>
            longed, but of the. Licinian.) Valerius Maximus gives a story of the <lb/>
            sordid avarice of the father, which illustrates what Lucilius says, that <lb/>
            when tribune of the Plebs, he took advantage of the " sacro-sanet" <lb/>
            character of his office to refuse paying his creditors their just claims, but <lb/>
            was compelled to do so by his colleagues. (Pighius assigns this event to <lb/>
            B. c. 155.) He was afterwards accused by P. Corn. Scipio Africanus <lb/>
            minor ; but being defended by Q. Metellus Macedonicus, was acquitted. <lb/>
            Cf. Cic. Brut. 21, where he gives him the epithet " veterator." He <lb/>
            was one of the partisans of the Gracchi. </note></p><pb n="321"/>

          <p>The extant Fragments of this book are too few and too varied in their mat­ <lb/>
            ter to enable us to form any definite idea of the general subject. From a <lb/>
            passage in Diomedes, (lib. iii. p. 483,) which contains the seventh Frag­ <lb/>
            ment, Schoenbeck supposes it must have referred to scenic matters; which <lb/>
            conjecture he considers further strengthened by the first Fragment. (Cf. <lb/>
            Plaut. Pers. I. iii. 78.) But, as Gerlach observes, " Chorago " in this <lb/>
            passage can hardly be understood in its primitive sense, since it is coupled <lb/>
            with the word " Quæstore ;" and as the quæstors had nothing to do with <lb/>
            the Ludi Scenici, except when it fell to them to take the place of the præ­ <lb/>
            tors or ædiles, this office could hardly be reckoned amongst their positive <lb/>
            or regular duties.</p>

            without any attempt on the part of editors or commentators to reduce it <lb/>
            to the form of a verse. The whole passage stands thus in the original: <lb/>
            " Alii a vino tragœdiam dictam arbitrantur : propterea quod olim dicta­ <lb/>

          <p>The Fragments of this book, as well as of the twelfth, are too few to admit <lb/>
            of any opinion being satisfactorily arrived at with respect to its subject. <lb/>
            Schoenbeck supposes it was directed against sumptuous extravagance and <lb/>

          <p>The fourteenth book contained, according to Schoenbeck's idea, the praises <lb/>
            of a placid and easy life. Duentzer, on the other hand, says the subject <lb/>
            was ambition. The two notions are not so much opposed, says Gerlach, as <lb/>
            at first sight they seem; the object of the poet being to contrast the frugal <lb/>
            simplicity and tranquil leisure of a rustic life, with the empty vanities and <lb/>
            arrogant assumption of the ambitious man. Thus the Fragments 2, 4, 5, <lb/>
            12, 15, 16, and perhaps 1, contain the praises of frugal parsimony and an <lb/>
            honourable leisure; 3, 6, 7, 8, and perhaps others, describe the heart-burn­ <lb/>
            ings and disappointments of a life devoted to ambition.</p>

            i. 61, " Malevoli, invidi, difficiles, lucifugi, maledici, monstrosi." Nebulo <lb/>
            is also applied to a vain, empty-headed fellow, of no more solidity than <lb/>
            a mist; and then to a spendthrift, who has devoured all his substance and <lb/>
            " left not a wrack behind." Vid. Ælium Stilum ap. Fest. in voc. Who <lb/>
            this desirable person was, is doubtful. Gerlach thinks that Lucilius' <lb/>
            quarrel with him began at the siege of Numantia, and that this Fragment <lb/>
            is part of a speech which the poet puts into the mouth of Scipio respect­ <lb/>
            ing his quæstor.—Tuditanus was a cognomen of the Sempronian gens, <lb/>
            from the " mallet-shaped " head of one of the family. Pavus may have <lb/>
            been derived from the taste shown by one of them for feeding and <lb/>
            fattening peacocks. There was a Publius Sempronius Tuditanus consul <lb/>
            with M. Cornelius Cethegus in B. c. 204, and a Caius Semp. Tuditanus <lb/>
            consul B. c. 129, the year of Scipio Africanus' death. Cicero speaks <lb/>
            highly of his eloquence, (Brut. c. 25,) and Dionysius Halicarnassius of <lb/>
            his historical powers (i. p. 9). </note><note type="footnote"> 4. Corpet supposes the allusion to be to the game called " duodecim <lb/>

            game. (Or. i. 50.) Gerlach supposes it to be a Fragment of the speech <lb/>
            of some plain countryman, who couples all these things together, to show <lb/>
            that they do not tend to make life happier.—Calces will be the white lines <lb/>

            says that the poet intended it as a defenee of true tranquillity of mind, in <lb/>
            opposition to the precepts and dogmas of the Stoies. In the sixth Frag­ <lb/>
            ment we certainly have mention made of a philosopher; but it is only to <lb/>
            assert that many common and homely articles in daily and constant use, <lb/>
            are of more real value than any philosopher of any sect. This, however, <lb/>
            may be supposed to be the opinion of some vulgar and ignorant plebeian, <lb/>
            or of a woman. In the fifth Fragment we have the eharaeter of a wife <lb/>
            portrayed, such as Juvenal describes so graphically in his sixth Satire. <lb/>
            Indolent and slatternly in her husband's presence, she reserves all her graces <lb/>
            of manner and elegance of ornament for the presenee of strangers. We <lb/>
            have besides a notice of the wonders in Homer's narratives, the praises of <lb/>
            a good horse, a picture of an usurer, an account of a soldier who has seen <lb/>
            service in Spain, an eulogy of frugality, and other matters; how all these <lb/>
            can possibly be arranged under one head, is, as Gerlach says, a matter of <lb/>
            the greatest obscurity.</p>
          <p>1 MEN think that many wonders described in Homer's verses <lb/>

          <p>We have in the old grammarians two conflicting accounts of the subject of <lb/>
            this book. Censorinus (de Die Natali, iii.) says that it contained a dis­ <lb/>
            cussion on the " double genius " which the Socratic Euclidcs assigned to <lb/>
            all the human race. On the other hand, Porphyrion (in a note of the <note type="footnote"> or vegetables. By tintinnabulum, Scaliger understands, " genus vehiculi." <lb/>
            But sirpiculæ (a sirpando) are also " the twigs with which bundles of <lb/>
            faggots, &amp;c., are bound together," which were also used in administering <lb/>
            punishment; and the allusion may be to this, as those who were led to <lb/>
            punishment sometimes carried bells. Vid. Turneb. Advers. xi. 21. <lb/>

            Decumanus (cf. ad iv. Fr. 2) is often applied to any thing of uncommon <lb/>
            size : here it is used for the worse kind of oil, (quasi ex decimâ quaque <lb/>
            mensurâ rejecto et projecto,) or more probably " such oil as the husband­ <lb/>
            man would select in order to furnish his decimæ," i. e. the very worst. <lb/>

            twenty-second ode of Horace's first book) 'tells us that, Horace here imi­ <lb/>
            tated Lucilius, who inscribed his sixteenth book to his mistress Collyra; <lb/>
            hence this book was called Collyra, as the ninth was styled Fornix (in <lb/>
            which also we may observe that it was stated that the double genius of <lb/>
            Euclides was discussed). Priscian again seems to imply (III. i. 8) that it <lb/>
            was inscribed to Fundius; and that Horace copied from it his fourteenth <lb/>
            Epistle of the first book. Gerlach considers the 1st, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th <lb/>
            Fragments may form part of a conversation between Lucilius and his stew­ <lb/>
            ard, on the true use of riches. The 10th Fragment may refer to Collyra, <lb/>
            especially if we may suppose that the 13th Fragment (incert.) refers to <lb/>
            the same person. If so, she was probably, like the Fornarina of Raffaelle, <lb/>
            some buxom <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρτοκόπος</foreign> (cf. Herod. i. 51) or confectioner. And this her <lb/>
            name seems to imply, Collyra being a kind of circular wheaten-cake, either <lb/>
            prepared in a frving-pan, or baked on the coals or in an oven. (Cf. Coli­ <lb/>
            phium, Juv. ii. 53, and Plaut. Pers. 1. iii. 12, " Collyræ facite ut madeant <lb/>
            et coliphia.") She is therefore the " valida pistrix " who understands the <lb/>
            whole mystery of making Mamphulæ, which, as Festus tells us, was a kind <lb/>
            of Syrian bread or cake, made without leaven.</p>

            dogma of the Stoics, " that no one could be said to possess any thing pe­ <lb/>
            culiarly his own." The poet therefore ridicules the creations of the older <lb/>
            poets, who have dignified their heroines with every conceivable embellish­ <lb/>
            ment, and invested them with the attractions of every virtue that adorns <lb/>

            are not even by them represented as exempt from those passions and vices <lb/>
            which disgrace their unromantic fellow-mortals. In this general detrac­ <lb/>

          <p>The same may be said of this book as of the eighteenth. The few Fragments <lb/>
            that remain being insufficient to furnish any data for a positive opinion as <lb/>
            to its subject. From the 2nd and 3rd Fragments, Mercer supposes that <lb/>
            the same question was discussed, which Cicero refers to in the Offices, <lb/>
            (lib. ii. c. 20,) " Whether a worthy man, without wealth, was to be pre­ <lb/>
            ferred to a very rich man who had but an indifferent reputation." The <lb/>
            second Fragment clearly contains a precept respecting the laying up a store <lb/>
            which may be made available in time of distress ; which Horace had per­ <lb/>
            haps in his eye in book i. Sat. i. 1. 33, seq. Itcontains likewise a criticism <lb/>
            on a verse of Eunius, as being little more than empty sound, devoid of true <lb/>
            poetic sentiment; which probably was the basis of Cicero's censure in the <lb/>
            Tusculan disputations. The study of dramatic composition is also dis­ <lb/>
            couraged, from the fact that the most elaborate passages are frequently <lb/>
            spoiled by the want of skill in the Tragic actor. In the 9th Fragment, <lb/>
            Däcke supposes there is an allusion to the Dulorestes of Pacuvius. The <lb/>
            7th Fragment may also probably refer to Ennius, as the principal word in <lb/>
            it is employed by him in the eleventh book of his Annals. There is pro­ <lb/>

          <p>Gerlach without hesitation pronounces the subject of this book to have <lb/>
            been “the superstition of the lower orders, and the luxury of the ban­ <lb/>
            quets of the wealthy." There were, even in the days of Lucilius, many <lb/>
            who could see through, and heartily despise, the ignorant superstition by <lb/>
            which their fellow-men were shackled. Hence the famous saying of Cato, <lb/>
            that he wondered how a soothsayer could look another of the same pro­ <lb/>
            fession in the face without laughing. The 3rd and 4th Fragments are <lb/>
            probably part of the speech of some notorious epicure, who cordially de­ <lb/>
            tests the simplicity and frugality of ancient days; and the 5th may con­ <lb/>
            tain the fierce expression of his unmeasured indignation at any attempt <lb/>
            to suppress or curtail the lavish munificence and luxurious self-indulgence <lb/>
            of men like himself. The 6th, 7th, and 9th Fragments may also refer to <lb/>
            the sumptuous banquets of the day.</p>

          <p>Gerlach considers this book to contain the strongest evidences of how much <lb/>
            Horace was indebted to Lucilius, not only in the choice of his subjects, <lb/>
            but also in his illustration and method of handling the subject when <lb/>
            chosen. In the 105th of the Fragments incerta, we find the words <lb/>
            " Valeri sententia dia" (which Horace imitates, i. Sat. ii. 32, " sententia <lb/>
            dia Catonis”). By Valerius he here supposes Q. Valerius Soranus to be <lb/>
            intended; a man of great learning, and an intimate friend of Publius <lb/>
            Scipio and Lucilius. He was author of a treatise on grammar, entitled <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐποπτίδων</foreign>; which contained, according to Turnebe's conjecture, a dis­ <lb/>
            cussion on the mysteries of literature and learning (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπόπτης</foreign> being applied <note type="footnote"> 1. Lamberat. Of. Hor. i. Sat. iii. 80, "Si quis eum servum, patinam <lb/>

            used in sacrifices. Hence Horace, i. Epist. x. 10, " Utque sacerdotis <lb/>

            to one initiated into the Mysteries). This is not improbable ; as he is said <lb/>
            to have lost his life for divulging the sacred and mysterious name of Rome. <lb/>
            Vid. Pluto Qu. Rom. lxi. [Two verses of his are quoted by Varro, L. L. <lb/>

          <p>With him, therefore, as a man of judgment and experience, Lucilius, who <lb/>
            had already acquired some ill-will from his Satires, consults, as to the <lb/>
            best method of avoiding all odium for the future, and as to the subjects <lb/>
            he shall select for his compositions. This book then contains an account <lb/>
            of this interview between the poet and his adviser; and Gerlach most in­ <lb/>
            geniously arranges the fragments in such an order, as to represent in <lb/>
            some manner the topics of discussion in a methodical sequence. These <lb/>
            are, chiefly, the propriety of his continuing to pursue the same style of <lb/>
            writing, and the enunciation of the opinions of both on matters relating <lb/>
            to war, marriage, and literary pursuits.</p>
          <p>Van Heusde and Schoenbeck give no definite idea of the subject. Peter­ <lb/>
            mann considers the subject matter to have been far more diversified. <lb/>
            The book begins, in his opinion, with a vivid description of the miseries <lb/>
            of conjugal life, introducing a very graphic matrimonial quarrel; this is <lb/>
            followed by so infinitely diversified a farrago of sentiments, that it is <lb/>
            hopeless to attempt to establish any systematic connexion between them.</p>
          <p>Corpet considers the whole to have been a philosophical discussion of the <lb/>
            miseries of human life, especially those attendant on the married state, <lb/>
            which the poet illustrated by the very forcible example of Agamemnon <lb/>
            and Clytæmnestra.</p>
          <p>The whole of the book was composed in the Trochaic metre ; consisting of <lb/>
            tetrameters catalectic and acatalectic. A few Fragments consist of Iambic <lb/>
            heptametcrs and octometers, (Iambici septenarii et octonarii,) unless, as <lb/>
            is not improbable, these lines have been referred to this book, through the <lb/>
            inadvertence of grammarians or copyists. It might, however, have been <lb/>
            intentional, as in the succeeding books we find Iambic, Trochaic, and <lb/>
            Dactylic metres, indiscriminately employed.</p>

          <p>The Fragments of this book are of too diversified a character to form a cor­ <lb/>
            rect conclusion with regard to the general subject. Corpet admits the <lb/>
            difficulty, but considers that it contained a criticism upon the philosophic <lb/>
            opinions of the day. Mercer thinks that the principal portion was occu­ <lb/>
            pied by a matrimonial discussion, in which the lady had decidedly the <lb/>
            better of the argument; who being sprung from a more noble descent, and <lb/>
            being possessed of a more ample fortune, considered that the control of <lb/>
            the household pertained to herself, as a matter of right. These conjectures, <lb/>
            however satisfactory as far as they go, will not sufficiently account for the <lb/>
            greater portion of the Fragments. Gerlach supposes that the book con­ <lb/>
            tained a defence of the poet's own pursuits and habits of life against the <lb/>
            attacks of calumniators. The book begins, therefore, with a conversation <lb/>
            between the poet and a friend, when the various points at issue are brought <lb/>
            forward and refuted. The chief of these are the study of poetry; which, <lb/>
            as Lucilius maintains, conduces greatly to the well being of the state. He <lb/>
            then defends his choice of the particular branch of poetry which he has <lb/>
            adopted, and proves that his satiric view is to be attributed to no arrogance, <lb/>
            self-sufficiency, or malevolence, or envy towards his fellow-men ; that he <lb/>
            himself is possessed of a certain evenness of temper, neither elated by <lb/>
            prosperity nor depressed by adversity. The result of this temperament <lb/>
            is an openness of heart, and frankness of disposition, which leads him to <lb/>
            form friendships rapidly, without that cautious circumspection which <lb/>
            commonly attends men of less equable tone of mind. This peculiar dis­ <lb/>
            position of mind is alto one which, extending to itself no indulgence for <lb/>
            any frailty, is but little inclined to overlook the weaknesses of others, but <lb/>
            impartially corrects the failings of itself and others: whereas the more <lb/>
            common character of mankind is to be indulgently blind to those faults to <lb/>
            which they are themselves inclined, and severely critical of the imperfec­ <lb/>
            tions of their neighbours. While others, again, make it their whole study <lb/>
            hypocritically to conceal their own defects. He concludes with a sentiment <lb/>
            which Horace has borrowed and enlarged upon, that whereas no perfec­ <lb/>
            tion can be expected in this life, he is to be accounted to have arrived most <lb/>
            nearly at the wished-for goal, who is disfigured by the fewest defects; and <lb/>
            since all human affairs are at the best but frail and fleeting, it is a charac­ <lb/>
            teristic of wisdom out of evils to choose the least.</p>
          <p>1 MOREOVER it is inherent in good men, whether they are <lb/>
            angry or kindly disposed, to remain long in the same way <lb/>
            of thinking. <note type="footnote"> 1. Propitius is sometimes applied to human beings as well as to deities. <lb/>

            iratum putant." The last line is very corrupt. Gerlach proposes to read <lb/>
            " soliditas propositi," which is scarcely tenable. </note></p><pb n="348"/>

          <p>Van Heusde considers that this book contained some severe strictures on <lb/>
            the part of a morose old man, or stern uncle, on the over-indulgence of a <lb/>
            fond and foolish father. Yet a considerable portion of the Satire seems to <lb/>
            contain a defence of the poet himself against the assaults of some invidious <lb/>
            maligners, and in order to do this, he enters, generally, into a discussion <lb/>
            of the habits and manners of young men of the age. Their licentiousness, <lb/>
            he is prepared to admit, has been in great measure produced by the want <lb/>
            of restraint in early youth. This petulance developes itself in an uncon­ <lb/>
            trolled licence of speech, regardless of all annoyance to the feelings of others, <lb/>
            —in avarice,—in haughtiness, the peculiar vice of men of rank,—ambition, <lb/>
            luxury, and love of sensual pleasure. These charges he illustrates by a <lb/>
            passage quoted from Cæcilius. Even those who do show some taste for <lb/>
            better things, and apply themselves to the cultivation of philosophy, do <lb/>
            not, like Polemon, adopt the severe maxims of a self-denying system, but <lb/>
            attach themselves to the school of Epicurus or Aristippus. To such as <lb/>
            these, all good advice, all endeavours to reclaim them to the rugged paths <lb/>
            of a stricter morality, are utterly hopeless and unavailing. <note type="footnote"> 42. Cibicidas, i. e.

            51, 52.) An old man is introduced, inveighing bitterly against the sloth, <lb/>
            the luxury, and immoderate extravagance of the young men of his day; <lb/>
            of their unscrupulousness as to the means by which the money was ac­ <lb/>
            quired, which was squandered on their licentious pleasures. He then <lb/>
            describes one of these scenes of dissipation; and shows how young men, <lb/>
            once entangled in the snares of their worthless paramours, not only become <lb/>
            lost to every principle of virtue and sense of shame, but are so completely <lb/>
            enslaved and enthralled by their passions, that they are able to refuse no­ <lb/>
            thing, however unworthy of them, which is exacted by their tyrannical <lb/>
            mistresses. This corruption extends itself, also, not only to the courts of <lb/>
            law, where justice has become a matter of barter, both with advocates and <lb/>
            judges, but its fatal effects may also be traced in the debasement and de­ <lb/>
            terioration of literature, of poetry, and of the public taste.</p>
          <p>1 WHEN he has done this, the culprit will be handed over <lb/>
            along with others to Lupus: he will not appear. He will <lb/>
            deprive the man of both primary matter and elements: <lb/>
            when he has prohibited him from the use of water and <lb/>
            fire, he has still two elements: he would have preferred</p>
          <p>. . . . . still he will deprive him— <lb/>
            2 .. and rest assured in your mind, that it will be a very <lb/>
            weighty reason indeed with me, which would draw me <lb/>

          <p>Most of the commentators seem to be agreed that the subject of this book <lb/>
            was “matrimonial life." Mercer considers that it contained an altercation <lb/>
            between a married couple, in which the lady strenuously refuses to submit <lb/>
            to the lawful authority of her husband. Van Heusde says that in it were <lb/>
            depicted the miseries of married life generally; especially of those husbands <lb/>
            who are so devoted to their wives, that they surrender the reins of govern­ <lb/>
            ment into the hands of those, for whom the law compels them to provide <lb/>
            subsistence, not only at the expense of their own personal labour, but also <lb/>
            at the risk of life itself: the only return which they receive as an equiva­ <lb/>
            lent from the hands of their wives, being opprobrious language, ill-temper, <lb/>
            haughty exaction, treachery, and unfaithfulness to the marriage-bed. In <lb/>
            addition to this, Gerlach thinks that in this, his last book, Lucilius reca­ <lb/>
            pitulated the subjects of his previous Satires; and consequently many <lb/>
            Fragments are assigned to this book, which might easily be inserted in <lb/>
            others. Amongst other matters, the poet also defends himself against the <lb/>
            malignant charges of envious critics, one, Gaius, being especially noticed <lb/>
            The story of the old lion, which Horace has copied, [i. Ep. i. 74,] may also <lb/>
            lead us to suppose that the treachery of false friends formed part of the <lb/>
            matter of the poem.</p>
          <p>N. B. Gerlach considers that the 30th was undoubtedly the last book. The <lb/>
            passages quoted from subsequent books are the result of the carelessness <lb/>
            of the Librarii. These passages, therefore, will all be found incorporated <lb/>
            into the preceding books.</p>

            Which shifts to every form, and shines in all : <lb/>

            You smile-was't a barbarian, then, that flew? <lb/>
            No, 'twas a Greek ; 'twas an ATHENIAN, too ! <lb n="125"/>
            -Bear with their state who will : for I disdain <lb/>
            To feed their upstart pride, or swell their train : <lb/>
            Slaves, that in Syrian lighters stowed, so late, <lb/>
            With figs and prunes, (an inauspicious freight,) <lb/>
            Already see their faith preferred to mine, <lb n="130"/>
            And sit above me ! and before me sign !— <lb/>
            That on the Aventine I first drew air, <lb/>

            Avails me not! our birthright now is lost, <lb/>
            And all our privilege, an empty boast! <lb n="135"/>
            </p>
          <p>For lo! where versed in every soothing art, <lb/>
            The wily Greek assails his patron's heart, <lb/>
            Finds in each dull harangue an air, a grace, <lb/>
            And all Adonis in a Gorgon face ; <lb/>
            Admires the voice that grates upon the ear,<lb n="140"/>
            Like the shrill scream of amorous chanticleer; <lb/>
            And equals the crane neck, and narrow chest, <lb/>

            So just, you view the very woman there, <lb n="150"/>
            And fancy all beneath the girdle bare ! <lb/>
            No longer now, the favourites of the stage <lb/>
            Boast their exclusive power to charm the age ; <lb/>
            The happy art with them a nation shares. <lb/>
            GREECE IS A THEATRE, WHERE ALL ARE PLAYERS. <lb n="155"/>
            For lo! their patron smiles,-they burst with mirth ; <lb/>
            He weeps,-they droop, the saddest souls on earth ; <lb/>
            He calls for fire,—they court the mantle's heat; <lb/>
            'Tis warm, he cries,-and they dissolve in sweat. <lb/>
            Ill-matched !-secure of victory they start, <lb n="160"/>
            Who, taught from youth to play a borrowed part, <lb/>
            Can, with a glance, the rising passion trace, <lb/>
            And mould their own, to suit their patron's face ; <lb/>
            At deeds of shame their hands admiring raise, <lb/>
            And mad debauchery's worst excesses praise. <lb n="165"/>
            </p>
          <p>Besides, no mound their raging lust restrains, <lb/>
            All ties it breaks, all sanctity profanes; <lb/>
            Wife, virgin-daughter, son unstained before, <lb/>

            On the pale crowd beneath, what would remain, <lb/>
            What joint, what bone, what atom of the slain ? <lb/>
            The body, with the soul, would vanish quite, <lb/>

            Sits pale and trembling on the Stygian coast, <lb n="395"/>
            Scared at the horrors of the novel scene, <lb/>
            At Charon's threatening voice, and scowling mien ; <lb/>
            Nor hopes a passage, thus abruptly hurled, <lb/>
            Without his farthing, to the nether world.</p>
          <p>Pass we these fearful dangers, and survey <lb n="400"/>
            What other evils threat our nightly way. <lb/>
            And first, behold the mansion's towering size, <lb/>
            Where floors on floors to the tenth story rise ; <lb/>
            Whence heedless garretteers their potsherds throw, <lb/>
            And crush the unwary wretch that walks below ! <lb n="405"/>

            As those report, who catch, with greedy ear, <lb/>
            And magnify the mighty things they hear. <lb/>
            Had this expense been meant, with well-timed skill,<lb n="25"/>
            To gull some childless dotard of a Will ; <lb/>
            Or bribe some rich and fashionable fair, <lb/>

            And even Apicius poor and frugal seems. <lb/>
            What! You, Crispinus, brought to Rome, erewhile, <lb/>
            Lapt in the rushes of your native Nile, <lb/>
            Buy scales, at such a price! you might, I guess, <lb n="35"/>
            Have bought the fisherman himself for less ; <lb/>
            Bought, in some countries, manors at this rate, <lb/>

            Yet, of his cheapest meals, the cheapest dish,<lb n="40"/>
            Was guttled down by this impurpled lord, <lb/>
            Chief knight, chief parasite, at Cæsar’s board, <lb/>
            Whom Memphis heard so late, with ceaseless yell, <lb/>
            Clamouring through all her streets—“ Ho ! shads to sell!"</p>

            Nor let the poet style you MAIDS, in vain.</p>
          <p>When the last Flavius, drunk with fury, tore <lb/>
            The prostrate world, which bled at every pore,<lb n="50"/>
            And Rome beheld, in body as in mind, <lb/>
            A bald-pate Nero rise, to curse mankind ; <lb/>
            It chanced, that where the fane of Venus stands, <lb/>
            Reared on Ancona's coast by Grecian hands, <lb/>
            A turbot, wandering from the Illyrian main,<lb n="55"/>
            Fill'd the wide bosom of the bursting seine. <lb/>
            Monsters so bulky, from its frozen stream, <lb/>
            Mæotis renders to the solar beam, <lb/>
            And pours them, fat with a whole winter's ease, <lb/>
            Through the bleak Euxine, into warmer seas. <lb n="60"/>

          <p>The mighty draught the astonished boatman eyes, <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> SAT. IV. </note> <lb/>
            For who would.dare to sell it ? who to buy? <lb/>
            When the coast swarmed with many a practised spy, <lb/>
            Mud-rakers, prompt to swear the fish had fled<lb n="65"/>
            From Cæsar's ponds, ingrate ! where long it fed, <lb/>
            And thus recaptured, claimed to be restored <lb/>
            To the dominion of its ancient lord! <lb/>
            Nay, if Palphurius may our credit gain, <lb/>
            I Whatever rare or precious swims the main,<lb n="70"/>
            Is forfeit to the crown, and you may seize <lb/>
            The obnoxious dainty, when and where you please. <lb/>
            This point allowed, our wary boatman chose <lb/>
            To give-what, else, he had not failed to lose.</p>
          <p>Now were the dogstar's sickly fervours o'er,<lb n="75"/>
            Earth, pinched with cold, her frozen livery wore; <lb/>
            The old began their quartan fits to fear, <lb/>
            And wintry blasts deformed the beauteous year, <lb/>
            And kept the turbot sweet: yet on he flew, <lb/>
            As if the sultry South corruption blew.— <lb n="80"/>
            And now the lake, and now the hill he gains, <lb/>
            Where Alba, though in ruins, still maintains <lb/>
            The Trojan fire, which, but for her, were lost, <lb/>
            And worships Vesta, though with less of cost.</p>
          <p>The wondering crowd, that gathered to survey <lb n="85"/>
            The enormous fish, and barred the fisher's way, <lb/>
            Satiate, at length retires ; the gates unfold !— <lb/>
            Murmuring, the excluded senators behold <lb/>
            The envied dainty enter :-On the man <lb/>
            To great Atrides pressed, and thus began. <lb n="90"/>

          <p>" This, for a private table far too great, <lb/>
            Accept, and sumptuously your Genius treat: <lb/>
            Haste to unload your stomach, and devour <lb/>
            A turbot, destined to this happy hour. <lb/>
            I sought him not ;-he marked the toils I set,<lb n="95"/>
            And rushed, a willing victim, to my net."</p>
          <p>Was flattery e'er so rank ! yet he grows vain, <lb/>
            And his crest rises at the fulsome strain. <lb/>
            When, to divine, a mortal power we raise, <lb/>
            He looks for no hyperboles in praise. <lb n="100"/>
            </p>
          <p>But when was joy unmixed ? no pot is found, <lb/>
            Capacious of the turbot's ample round : <lb/>
            In this distress, he calls the chiefs of state, <lb/>
            At once the objects of his scorn and hate, <lb/>
            In whose pale cheeks distrust and doubt appear,<lb n="105"/>
            And all a tyrant's friendship breeds of fear.</p>
          <p>Scarce was the loud Liburnian heard to say, <lb/>
            " He sits," ere Pegasus was on his way ; <lb/>
            Yes :-the new bailiff of the affrighted town, <lb/>
            (For what were Prefects more?) had snatched his gown,<pb n="393"/>
            <note type="margin"> SAT. IV. </note> <lb n="110"/>
            And rushed to council: from the ivory chair, <lb/>
            He dealt out justice with no common care ; <lb/>
            But yielded oft to those licentious times, <lb/>
            And where he could not punish, winked at crimes.</p>
          <p>Then old, facetious Crispus tript along, <lb n="115"/>
            Of gentle manners, and persuasive tongue : <lb/>
            None fitter to advise the lord of all, <lb/>
            Had that pernicious pest, whom thus we call, <lb/>
            Allowed a friend to soothe his savage mood, <lb/>
            And give him counsel, wise at once and good. <lb n="120"/>
            But who shall dare this liberty to take, <lb/>
            When, every word you hazard, life's at stake ? <lb/>
            Though but of stormy summers, showery springs- <lb/>
            For tyrants' ears, alas! are ticklish things. <lb/>
            So did the good old man his tongue restrain ; <lb n="125"/>
            Nor strove to stem the torrent's force in vain. <lb/>
            Not one of those, who, by no fears deterred, <lb/>
            Spoke the free soul, and truth to life preferred. <lb/>
            He temporized-thus fourscore summers fled, <lb/>
            Even in that court, securely, o'er his head. <lb n="130"/>
            </p>
          <p>Next him, appeared Acilius hurrying on, <lb/>
            Of equal age,-and followed by his son; <lb/>
            Who fell, unjustly fell, in early years, <lb/>
            A victim to the tyrant's jealous fears : <lb/>
            But long ere this were hoary hairs become<lb n="135"/>
            A prodigy, among the great, at Rome; <lb/>
            Hence, had I rather owe my humble birth, <lb/>
            Frail brother of the giant-brood, to earth. <lb/>
            Poor youth ! in vain the ancient sleight you try ; <lb/>
            In vain, with frantic air, and ardent eye, <lb n="140"/>
            Fling every robe aside, and battle wage <lb/>
            With bears and lions, on the Alban stage. <lb/>
            All see the trick : and, spite of Brutus' skill, <lb/>
            There are who count him but a driveller still ; <lb/>
            Since, in his days, it cost no mighty pains <lb n="145"/>
            To outwit a prince, with much more beard than brains.</p>
          <p>Rubrius, though not, like these, of noble race, <lb/>
            Followed with equal terror in his face ; <lb/>
            And, labouring with a crime too foul to name, <lb/>
            More, than the pathic satirist, lost to shame.<lb n="150"/>
            </p>
          <p>Montanus' belly next, and next appeared <lb/>
            The legs, on which that monstrous pile was reared.</p>
          <p>Crispinus followed, daubed with more perfume, <lb/>
            Thus early! than two funerals consume. <lb/>
            Then bloodier Pompey, practised to betray,<lb n="155"/>
            And hesitate the noblest lives away. <lb/>
            Then Fuscus, who in studious pomp at home, <lb/>
            Planned future triumphs for the Arms of Rome. <pb n="394"/>
            <note type="margin"> SAT. IV. </note> <lb/>
            Blind to the event! those arms, a different fate, <lb/>
            Inglorious wounds, and Dacian vultures, wait. 160</p>
          <p>Last, sly Veiento with Catullus came, <lb/>
            Deadly Catullus, who, at beauty's name <lb/>
            Took fire, although unseen : a wretch, whose crimes <lb/>
            Struck with amaze even those prodigious times. <lb/>
            A base, blind parasite, a murderous lord,<lb n="165"/>
            From the bridge-end raised to the council-board ; <lb/>
            Yet fitter still to dog the traveller's heels, <lb/>
            And whine for alms to the descending wheels! <lb/>
            None dwelt so largely on the turbot's size, <lb/>
            Or raised with such applause his wondering eyes; <lb n="170"/>
            But to the left (0, treacherous want of sight) <lb/>
            He poured his praise ;—the fish was on the right! <lb/>
            Thus would he at the fencer's matches sit, <lb/>
            And shout with rapture, at some fancied hit; <lb/>
            And thus applaud the stage-machinery, where <lb n="175"/>
            The youths were rapt aloft, and lost in air.</p>
          <p>Nor fell Veiento short :-as if possest <lb/>
            With all Bellona's rage, his labouring breast <lb/>
            Burst forth in prophecy ; " I see, I see <lb/>
            The omens of some glorious victory!<lb n="180"/>
            Some powerful monarch captured !—lo, he rears, <lb/>
            Horrent on every side, his pointed spears! <lb/>
            Arviragus hurled from the British ear : <lb/>
            The fish is foreign, foreign is the war."</p>
          <p>Proceed, great seer, and what remains untold,<lb n="185"/>
            The turbot's age and country, next unfold; <lb/>
            So shall your lord his fortunes better know, <lb/>
            And where the conquest waits and who the foe.</p>
          <p>The emperor now the important question put, <lb/>
            " How say ye, Fathers, SHALL THE FISH BE CUT?"<lb n="190"/>
            " 0, far be that disgrace," Montanus cries ; <lb/>
            " No, let a pot be formed, of amplest size, <lb/>
            Within whose slender sides the fish, dread sire, <lb/>
            May spread his vast circumference entire! <lb/>
            Bring, bring the tempered clay, and let it feel <lb n="195"/>
            The quick gyrations of the plastic wheel :— <lb/>
            But, Cæsar, thus forewarned, .make no campaign, <lb/>
            Unless your potters follow in your train !"</p>
          <p>Montanus ended ; all approved the plan, <lb/>
            And all, the speech, so worthy of the man!<lb n="200"/>
            Versed in the old court luxury, he knew <lb/>
            The feasts of Nero, and his midnight crew ; <lb/>
            Where oft, when potent draughts had fired the brain, <lb/>
            The jaded taste was spurred to gorge again.- <lb/>
            And. in my time, none understood so well <lb n="205"/>
            The science of good eating: he could tell, <pb n="395"/>
            <note type="margin"> SAT. V. </note> <lb/>
            At the first relish, if his oysters fed <lb/>
            On the Rutupian, or the Lucrine bed; <lb/>
            And from a crab, or lobster's colour, name <lb/>
            The country, nay, the district, whence it came.<lb n="210"/>
            </p>
          <p>Here closed the solemn farce. The Fathers rise, <lb/>
            And each, submissive, from the presence hies :— <lb/>
            Pale, trembling wretches, whom the chief, in sport, <lb/>
            Had dragged, astonished, to the Alban court; <lb/>
            As if the stern Sicambri were in arms,<lb n="215"/>
            Or the fierce Catti threatened new alarms; <lb/>
            As if ill news by flying posts had come, <lb/>
            And gathering nations sought the fall of Rome !</p>
          <p>O! that such scenes (disgraceful at the most) <lb/>
            Had all those years of cruelty engrost, <lb n="220"/>
            Through which his rage pursued the great and good, <lb/>
            Unchecked, while vengeance slumbered o'er their blood! <lb/>
            And yet he fell !-for when he changed his game. <lb/>
            And first grew dreadful to the vulgar name, <lb/>
            They seized the murderer, drenched with Lamian gore, <lb n="225"/>
            And hurled him, headlong, to the infernal shore!</p>

            Which decked with nobler grace the hero's sword, <lb/>
            Whom Dido prized, above the Libyan lord.<lb n="75"/>
            From such he drinks: to you the slaves allot <lb/>
            The Beneventine cobbler's four-lugged pot, <lb/>
            A fragment, a mere shard, of little worth, <lb/>
            But to be trucked for matches-and so forth.</p>
          <p>If Virro's veins with indigestion glow,<lb n="80"/>
            They bring him water cooled in Scythian snow : <lb/>
            What! did I late complain a different wine <lb/>

          <p>Getulian slaves your vile potations pour, <lb/>

            Nor all the wealth-of all the kings of Rome! <lb/>
            Bear this in mind ; and when the cup you need, <lb/>

            Trips by them, with indifference or disdain. <lb/>
            If called, he hears not, or, with rage inflamed— <lb/>
            Indignant, that his services are claimed <lb/>
            By an old client, who, ye gods ! commands, <lb n="100"/>
            And sits at ease, while his superior stands ! <lb/>
            Such proud, audacious minions swarm in Rome, <lb/>
            And trample on the poor, where'er they come.</p>
          <p>Mark with what insolence another thrusts <lb/>
            Before your plate th' impenetrable crusts, <lb n="105"/>
            Black, mouldy fragments, which defy the saw, <lb/>
            The mere despair of every aching jaw! <lb/>
            While manchets, of the finest flour, are set <lb/>
            Before your lord ; but be you mindful, yet, <lb/>
            And taste not, touch not : of the pantler stand <lb n="110"/>
            In trembling awe, and check your desperate hand- <lb/>
            Yet, should you dare-a slave springs forth, to wrest <lb/>
            The sacred morsel from you. " Saucy guest," <lb/>
            He frowns, and mutters, " wilt thou ne'er divine <lb/>
            What's for thy patron's tooth, and what for thine ? <lb n="115"/>

            And up the bleak Esquilian urged my way, <lb/>

            Brought post to Rome ; since Ostia's shores no more <lb/>
            Supply the insatiate glutton, as of yore, <lb/>
            Thinned by the net, whose everlasting throw <lb/>
            Allows no Tuscan fish in peace to grow. <lb n="145"/>
            Still luxury yawns, unfilled ; the nations rise, <lb/>
            And ransack all their coasts for fresh supplies : <lb/>
            Thence come your presents; thence, as rumour tells, <lb/>

          <p>A lamprey next, from the Sicilian straits,<lb n="150"/>
            Of more than common size, on Virro waits-- <lb/>
            For oft as Auster seeks his cave, and flings <lb/>
            The cumbrous moisture from his dripping wings, <lb/>
            Forth flies the daring fisher, lured by gain, <lb/>
            While rocks oppose, and whirlpools threat in vain. <lb n="155"/>

            A few brief hints :—We look not to receive <lb/>

            What the good Piso, to an humble friend ;— <lb/>

            0, there is much, that never can be spoke <lb/>

          <p>YES, I believe that CHASTITY was known, <lb/>
            And prized on earth, while Saturn filled the throne ; <lb/>
            When rocks a bleak and scanty shelter gave, <lb/>
            When sheep and shepherds thronged one common cave, <lb/>
            And when the mountain wife her couch bestrewed <lb n="5"/>
            With skins of beasts, joint tenants of the wood, <lb/>
            And reeds, and leaves plucked from the neighbouring tree :— <lb/>
            A woman, Cynthia, far unlike to thee, <lb/>
            Or thee, weak child of fondness and of fears, <lb/>
            Whose eyes a sparrow's death suffused with tears :<lb n="10"/>
            But strong, and reaching to her burly brood <lb/>
            Her big-swollen breasts, replete with wholesome food, <lb/>
            And rougher than her husband, gorged with mast, <lb/>
            And frequent belching from the coarse repast. <lb/>
            For when the world was new, the race that broke, <lb n="15"/>
            Unfathered, from the soil or opening oak, <lb/>
            Lived most unlike the men of later times, <lb/>
            The puling brood of follies and of crimes.</p>
          <p>Haply some trace of Chastity remained, <lb/>
            While Jove, but Jove as yet unbearded, reigned; <lb n="20"/>
            Before the Greek bound, by another's head, <lb/>
            His doubtful faith ; or men, of theft in dread, <lb/>
            Had learned their herbs and fruitage to immure, <lb/>
            But all was unenclosed, and all secure ! <lb/>
            At length Astrea, from these confines driven, <lb n="25"/>
            Regained by slow degrees her native heaven ; <lb/>
            With her retired her sister in disgust, <lb/>
            And left the world to rapine, and to lust.</p>
          <p>'Tis not a practice, friend, of recent date, <lb/>
            But old, established, and inveterate,<lb n="30"/>

            The sacred Genius of the nuptial rite : <lb/>
            All other crimes the Age of Iron curst; <lb/>
            But that of Silver saw adulterers first. <lb/>

            Wilt thou the turtle and the turbot lose, <lb n="50"/>
            And all the dainties, which the flatterer, still <lb/>
            Heaps on the childless, to secure his Will ?</p>
          <p>But what will hence impossible be held, <lb/>
            If thou, old friend, to wedlock art impelled ? <lb/>
            If thou, the veriest debauchee in town, <lb n="55"/>
            With whom wives, widows, every thing went down, <lb/>
            Shouldst stretch the unsuspecting neck, and poke <lb/>
            Thy foolish nose into the marriage yoke ? <lb/>
            Thou, famed for scapes, and, by the trembling wife, <lb/>
            Thrust in a chest so oft, to save thy life !— <lb n="60"/>
            </p>
          <p>But what! Ursidius hopes a mate to gain, <lb/>
            Frugal, and chaste, and of the good old strain : <lb/>
            Alas, he's frantic! ope a vein with speed, <lb/>
            And bleed him copiously, good doctor, bleed. <lb/>
            Jewel of men ! thy knees to Jove incline,<lb n="65"/>
            And let a heifer fall at Juno's shrine, <lb/>
            If thy researches for a wife be blest, <lb/>
            With one, who is notneed I speak the rest ? <lb/>
            Ah ! few the matrons Ceres now can find, <lb/>
            Her hallowed fillets, with chaste hands, to bind ; <lb n="70"/>
            Few whom their fathers with their lips can trust, <lb/>
            So strong their filial kisses smack of lust!</p>
          <p>Go then, prepare to bring your mistress home, <lb/>
            And crown your doors with garlands, ere she come.- <lb/>
            But will one man suffice, methinks, you cry,<lb n="75"/>
            For all her wants and wishes ? Will one eye !</p>
          <p>And yet there runs, 'tis said, a wondrous tale, <lb/>
            Of some pure maid, who lives-in some lone vale. <lb/>
            There she MAY live ; but let the phoenix, placed <lb/>
            At Gabii or Fidense, prove as chaste so <lb/>
            As at her father's farm!—Yet who will swear, <lb/>
            That nought is done in night and silence there ? <lb/>
            Time was, when Jupiter and Mars, we're told, <lb/>

            She slipt into the stews, unseen, unknown, <lb/>

            -Still raging with the fever of desire, <lb/>
            Her veins all turgid, and her blood all fire, <lb n="185"/>
            With joyless pace, the imperial couch she sought, <lb/>
            And to her happy spouse (yet slumbering) brought <lb/>

            Because she brought him thousands : such the price <lb/>

            Not for her charms the wounded lover pined,<lb n="200"/>
            Nor felt the flame which fires the ardent mind, <lb/>
            Plutus, not Cupid, touched his sordid heart; <lb/>
            And 'twas her dower that winged the unerring dart. <lb/>
            She brought enough her liberty to buy, <lb/>
            And tip the wink before her husband's eye. <lb n="205"/>

            Not one who feels it, and, ere ruin come, <lb/>
            To her small means conforms. Taught by the ant, <lb/>
            Men sometimes guard against the extreme of want, <lb/>
            And stretch, though late, their providential fears, <lb n="525"/>
            </p>
          <p>To food and raiment for their future years : <lb/>
            But women never see their wealth decay; <lb/>
            With lavish hands they scatter night and day, <lb/>
            As if the gold, with vegetative power, <lb/>
            Would spring afresh, and bloom from hour to hour;<lb n="530"/>
            As if the mass its present size would keep, <lb/>
            And no expense reduce the eternal heap.</p>
          <p>Others there are, who centre all their bliss <lb/>
            In the soft eunuch, and the beardless kiss: <lb/>
            They need not from his chin avert their face,<lb n="535"/>
            Nor use abortive drugs, for his embrace. <lb/>
            But oh ! their joys run high, if be be formed, <lb/>
            When his full veins the fire of love has warmed ; <lb/>
            When every part's to full perfection reared, <lb/>
            And nought of manhood wanting, but the beard. <lb n="540"/>
            </p>
          <p>But should the dame in music take delight, <lb/>
            The public singer is disabled quite : <lb/>
            In vain the prætor guards him all be can ; <lb/>
            She slips the buckle, and enjoys her man. <lb/>
            Still in her hand his instrument is found, <lb n="545"/>
            Thick set with gems, that shed a lustre round ; <lb/>
            Still o'er his lyre the ivory quill she flings, <lb/>
            Still runs divisions on the trembling strings, <lb/>
            The trembling strings, which the loved Hedymel <lb/>
            Was wont to strike-so sweetly, and so well! <lb n="550"/>
            These still she holds, with these she soothes her woes, <lb/>
            And kisses on the dear, dear wire bestows.</p>
          <p>A noble matron of the Lamian line <lb/>
            Inquired of Janus, (offering meal and wine,) <lb/>
            If Pollio, at the Harmonic Games, would speed, <lb n="555"/>
            And wear the oaken crown, the victor's meed! <lb/>
            What could she for a husband, more, have done, <lb/>
            What for an only, an expiring son ? <lb/>
            Yes ; for a harper, the besotted dame <lb/>
            Approached the altar, reckless of her fame, <lb n="560"/>
            And veiled her head, and, with a pious air, <lb/>
            Followed the Aruspex through the form of prayer ; <lb/>
            And trembled, and turned pale, as he explored <lb/>
            The entrails, breathless for the fatal word ! <pb n="413"/>
             <note type="margin">SAT. VI. </note> <lb/>
            But, tell me, father Janus, if you please, <lb n="565"/>
            Tell me, most ancient of the deities, <lb/>
            Is your attention to such suppliants given ? <lb/>
            If so-there is not much to do in heaven! <lb/>
            For a comedian, this consults your will, <lb/>
            For a tragedian, that; kept standing, still, <lb n="570"/>
            By this eternal route, the wretched priest <lb/>
            Feels his legs swell, and dies to be releast.</p>
          <p>But let her rather sing, than roam the streets, <lb/>
            And thrust herself in every crowd she meets ; <lb/>
            Chat with great generals, though her lord be there, <lb n="575"/>
            With lawless eye, bold front, and bosom bare.</p>
          <p>She, too, with curiosity o'erflows, <lb/>
            And all the news of all the world she knows; <lb/>
            Knows what in Scythia, what in Thrace is done ; <lb/>
            The secrets of the step-dame and the son; <lb n="580"/>
            Who speeds, and who is jilted : and can swear, } <lb/>
            Who made the widow pregnant, when and where, <lb/>
            And what she said, and how she frolicked there.-</p>
          <p>She first espied the star, whose baleful ray, <lb/>
            O'er Parthia, and Armenia, shed dismay : <lb n="585"/>
            She watches at the gates, for news to come, <lb/>
            And intercepts it, as it enters Rome; <lb/>
            Then, fraught with full intelligence, she flies <lb/>
            Through every street, and, mingling truth with lies, <lb/>
            Tells how Niphates bore down every mound, <lb n="590"/>
            And poured his desolating flood around ; <lb/>
            How earth, convulsed, disclosed her caverns hoar, <lb/>
            And cities trembled, and-were seen no more !</p>
          <p>And yet this itch, though never to be cured, <lb/>
            Is easier, than her cruelty, endured. <lb n="595"/>
            Should a poor neighbour's do, but discompose <lb/>
            Her rest a moment, wild with rage she grows; <lb/>
            " Ho! whips," she cries, " and flay that brute accurst; <lb/>
            " But flay that rascal there, who owns him, first." <lb/>
            Dangerous to meet while in these frantic airs,<lb n="600"/>
            And terrible to look at, she prepares <lb/>
            To bathe at night; she issues her commands, <lb/>
            And in long ranks forth march the obedient bands, <lb/>
            With tubs, cloths, oils :-for 'tis her dear delight <lb/>
            To sweat in clamour, tumult, and affright. <lb n="605"/>
            </p>
          <p>When her tired arms refuse the balls to ply, <lb/>
            And the lewd bath-keeper has rubbed her dry, <lb/>
            She calls to mind each miserable guest, <lb/>
            Long since with hunger, and with sleep opprest, <lb/>
            And hurries home; all glowing, all athirst, <lb n="610"/>
            For wine, whole flasks of wine! and swallows, first, <pb n="414"/>

            Two quarts, to clear her stomach, and excite <lb/>

            And flows in purple torrents round the hall; <lb n="615"/>
            Or a gilt ewer receives the foul contents, <lb/>
            And poisons all the house with vinous scents. <lb/>
            So, dropt into a vat, a snake is said <lb/>
            To drink and spew :-the husband turns his head, <lb/>
            Sick to the soul, from this disgusting scene,<lb n="620"/>
            And struggles to suppress his rising spleen.</p>
          <p>But she is more intolerable yet, <lb/>
            Who plays the critic when at table set; <lb/>
            Calls Virgil charming, and attempts to prove <lb/>
            Poor Dido right, in venturing all for love.<lb n="625"/>
            From Maro, and Masonides, she quotes <lb/>
            The striking passages, and, while she notes <lb/>
            Their beauties and defects, adjusts her scales, <lb/>
            And accurately weighs which bard prevails. <lb/>
            The astonished guests sit mute : grammarians yield,<lb n="630"/>
            Loud rhetoricians, baffled, quit the field; <lb/>
            Even auctioneers and lawyers stand aghast, <lb/>
            And not a woman speaks !-So thick, and fast, <lb/>
            The wordy shower descends, that you would swear <lb/>
            A thousand bells were jangling in your ear,<lb n="635"/>
            A thousand basins clattering. Vex no more <lb/>
            Your trumpets and your timbrels, as of yore, <lb/>
            To ease the labouring moon ; her single yell <lb/>
            Can drown their clangour, and dissolve the spell.</p>
          <p>She lectures too in Ethics, and declaims <lb n="640"/>
            On the CHIEF GOOD !-but, surely, she who aims <lb/>
            To seem too learn'd, should take the male array ; <lb/>
            A hog, due offering, to Sylvanus slay, <lb/>
            And, with the Stoic's privilege, repair <lb/>
            To farthing baths, and strip in public there! <lb n="645"/>
            </p>
          <p>Oh, never may the partner of my bed <lb/>

            Nor whirl her rapid syllogisms around, <lb/>

            Enough for me, if common things she know,<lb n="650"/>

            I hate the female pedagogue, who pores <lb/>

            All modes of speech, regardless of the sense, <lb/>

            From some old canticle of Numa's days ; <lb/>

            Her faults, and make all lawful in her eye. <lb/>
            Sure, of all ills with which mankind are curst, <lb/>
            A wife who brings you money is the worst.<lb n="665"/>
            Behold ! her face a spectacle appears, <lb/>
            Bloated, and foul, and plastered to the ears <lb/>
            With viscous paste :-the husband looks askew, <lb/>
            And sticks his lips in this detested glue. <lb/>
            She meets the adulterer bathed, perfumed, and drest, <lb n="670"/>

            For him she breathes of nard ; for him alone <lb/>

            Scales the first layer of roughcast from her face,<lb n="675"/>

            All, all is lost; the housekeeper is stripped, <lb/>

            How long her jaundiced mother may hold out; <lb/>

            The louring aspect of old Saturn shows ; <lb/>

            To shed her mildest influence from the skies ; <lb/>

            The dame, whose Manual of Astrology <lb n="825"/>
            Still dangles at her side, smooth as chafed gum, <lb/>
            And fretted by her everlasting thumb !— <lb/>
            Deep in the science now, she leaves her mate <lb/>

            The middle sort, a quack, at whose command <lb/>

            Then, to the mansions of the great she bears <lb/>
            The precious brats, and, for herself, prepares <lb/>
            A secret farce ; adopts them for her own : <lb/>

            Deserting truth, I choose a fabled theme, <lb/>
            And, like the buskined bards of Greece, declaim, <lb/>
            In deep-mouthed tones, in swelling strains, on crimes <lb/>
            As yet unknown to our Rutulian climes!<lb n="925"/>
            Would it were so ! but Pontia cries aloud, <lb/>
            " No, I performed it." See ! the fact's avowed­ <lb/>

            Crimes of dire name, which, disbelieved of yore, <lb/>
            Become familiar, and revolt no more :<lb n="935"/>
            Those ancient dames in scenes of blood were bold, <lb/>
            And wrought fell deeds, but not, as ours, for gold :— <lb/>
            In every age, we view, with less surprise, <lb/>
            Such horrors as from bursts of fury rise, <lb/>
            When stormy passions, scorning all control,<lb n="940"/>
            Rend the mad bosom, and unseat the soul. <lb/>
            As when impetuous winds, and driving rain, <lb/>

            But here the difference lies :-those bungling wives, <lb/>
            With a blunt axe hacked out their husbands' lives;<lb n="955"/>
            While now, the deed is done with dexterous art, <lb/>
            And a drugged bowl performs the axe's part. <lb/>
            Yet, if the husband, prescient of his fate, <lb/>
            Have fortified his breast with mithridate, <lb/>
            She baffles him e'en there, and has recourse <lb n="960"/>

            Pour it, mistaken men, who rack your brains <lb/>
            In dungeons, cocklofts, for heroic strains ; <lb/>

            Creeps, like a tetter, through the human breast,<lb n="80"/>
            Nor knows, nor hopes a cure ; since years, which chill <lb/>

            No spurious metal, fused from common ores, <lb/>
            But gold, to matchless purity refined, <lb/>
            And stamped with all the godhead in his mind; <lb/>
            He whom I feel, but want the power to paint, <lb/>
            Springs from a soul impatient of restraint,<lb n="90"/>
            And free from every care ; a soul that loves <lb/>
            The Muse's haunts, clear founts and shady groves. <lb/>
            Never, no never, did He wildly rave, <lb/>
            And shake his thyrsus in the Aonian cave, <lb/>
            Whom poverty kept sober, and the cries<lb n="95"/>
            Of a lean stomach, clamorous for supplies : <lb/>
            No ; the wine circled briskly through the veins, <lb/>
            When Horace poured his dithyrambic strains!- <lb/>
            What room for fancy, say, unless the mind, <lb/>
            And all its thoughts, to poesy resigned,<lb n="100"/>
            Be hurried with resistless force along, <lb/>

            The steeds, the chariots, and the forms of gods : <lb/>
            And the fierce Fury, as her snakes she shook, <lb/>

            Those snakes, had Virgil no Mæcenas found, <lb/>
            Had dropt, in listless length, upon the ground ; [sound. <lb n="110"/>

          <p>Yet we expect, from Lappa's tragic rage, <lb/>

            But what is this, if this be all you give, <lb/>
            To Bassus and Serranus? They must live ! <lb n="125"/>
            </p>
          <p>When Statius fixed a morning, to recite <lb/>
            His Thebaid to the town, with what delight <lb/>
            They flocked to hear ! with what fond rapture hung <lb/>
            On the sweet strains, made sweeter by his tongue! <lb/>
            Yet, while the seats rung with a general peal <lb n="130"/>
            Of boisterous praise, the bard had lacked a meal, <lb/>
            Unless with Paris he had better sped, <lb/>
            And trucked a virgin tragedy for bread. <lb/>
            Mirror of men ! he showers, with liberal hands, <lb/>
            On needy poets, honours and commands :—<lb n="135"/>
            An actor's patronage a peer's outgoes, <lb/>
            And what the last withholds, the first bestows! <lb/>
            -And will you still on Camerinus wait, <lb/>
            And Bareas ? will you still frequent the great ? <lb/>
            Ah, rather to the player your labours take,<lb n="140"/>
            And at one lucky stroke your fortune make!</p>
          <p>Yet envy not the man who earns hard bread <lb/>
            By tragedy : the Muses' friends are fled !— <lb/>
            Mæcenas, Proculeius, Fabius, gone, <lb/>
            And Lentulus, and Cotta,—every one!<lb n="145"/>
            THEN worth was cherished, then the bard might toil, <lb/>
            Secure of favour, o'er the midnight oil; <lb/>
            Then all December's revelries refuse, <lb/>
            And give the festive moments to the Muse.</p>
          <p>So fare the tuneful race : but ampler gains <lb n="150"/>
            Await, no doubt, the grave HISTORIANS’ pains! <lb/>
            More time, more study they require, and pile <lb/>
            Page upon page, heedless of bulk the while, <lb/>
            Till, fact conjoined to fact with thought intense, <lb/>
            The work is closed, at many a ream's expense! <lb n="155"/>
            Say now, what harvest was there ever found, <lb/>
            What golden crop, from this long-laboured ground ? <lb/>
            'Tis barren all; and one poor plodding scribe <lb/>
            Gets more by framing pleas than all the tribe.</p>
          <p>True :—’tis a slothful breed, that, nurst in ease, <lb n="160"/>
            Soft beds, and whispering shades, alone can please. <lb/>
            Say then, what gain the LAWYER'S toil affords, <lb/>
            His sacks of papers, and his war of words ? <lb/>
            Heavens! how he bellows in our tortured ears; <lb/>
            But then, then chiefly, when the client hears, <lb n="165"/>
            Or one prepared, with vouchers, to attest <lb/>
            Some desperate debt, more anxious than the rest, <lb/>
            Twitches his elbow : then, his passions rise !, <lb/>
            Then, forth he puffs the immeasurable lies <lb/>
            From his swollen lungs! then, the white foam appears, <lb n="170"/>
            And, drivelling down his beard, his vest besmears!</p><pb n="425"/>

          <p>The Generals take their seats in regal wise. <lb/>
            You, my pale Ajax, watch the hour, and rise, <lb/>
            In act to plead a trembling client's cause, <lb/>
            Before Judge Jolthead—learned in the laws. <lb/>
            Now stretch your throat, unhappy man ! now raise <lb n="180"/>
            Your clamours, that, when hoarse, a bunch of bays, <lb/>
            Stuck in your garret window, may declare, <lb/>
            That some victorious pleader nestles there ! <lb/>
            O glorious hour ! but what your fee, the while ? <lb/>
            A rope of shrivelled onions from the Nile,<lb n="185"/>
            A rusty ham, a jar of broken sprats, <lb/>
            And wine, the refuse of our country vats ; <lb/>
            Five flagons for four causes! if you hold, <lb/>
            Though this indeed be rare, a piece of gold; <lb/>
            The brethren, as per contract, on you fall, <lb n="190"/>
            And share the prize, solicitors and all!</p>
          <p>Whate'er he asks, Æmilius may command, <lb/>
            Though more of law be ours : but lo ! there stand <lb/>
            Before his gate, conspicuous from afar, <lb/>
            Four stately steeds, yoked to a brazen car : <lb n="195"/>
            And the great pleader, looking wary round, <lb/>
            On a fierce charger that disdains the ground, <lb/>
            Levels his threatening spear, in act to throw, <lb/>
            And seems to meditate no common blow.</p>
          <p>Such arts as these, to beggary Matho brought,<lb n="200"/>
            And such the ruin of Tongillus wrought, <lb/>
            Who, with his troop of slaves, a draggled train, <lb/>
            Annoyed the baths, of his huge oil-horn vain ; <lb/>
            Swept through the Forum, in a chair of state, <lb/>
            To every auction,-villas, slaves, or plate; <lb n="205"/>
            And, trading on the credit of his dress, <lb/>
            Cheapened whate'er he saw, though penniless!</p>
          <p>And some, indeed, have thriven by tricks like these : <lb/>
            Purple and violet swell a lawyer's fees ; <lb/>
            Bustle and show above his means conduce <lb n="210"/>
            To business, and profusion proves of use. <lb/>
            The vice is universal : Rome confounds <lb/>
            The wealthiest;—prodigal beyond all bounds !</p>
          <p>Could our old pleaders visit earth again, <lb/>
            Tully himself would scarce a brief obtain, <lb n="215"/>
            Unless his robe were purple, and a stone, <lb/>
            Diamond or ruby, on his finger shone. <lb/>
            The wary plaintiff, ere a fee he gives, <lb/>
            Inquires at what expense his counsel lives; <pb n="426"/>
            <note type="margin"> SAT. VII. </note> <lb/>
            Has he eight slaves, ten followers ? chairs to wait,<lb n="220"/>
            And clients to precede his march in state ? <lb/>
            This Paulus knows full well, and, therefore, hires <lb/>
            A ring to plead in ; therefore, too, acquires <lb/>
            More briefs than Cossus :-preference not unsound, <lb/>
            For how should eloquence in rags be found?<lb n="225"/>
            Who gives poor Basilus a cause of state ? <lb/>
            When, to avert a trembling culprit's fate, <lb/>
            Shows he a weeping mother ? or who heeds <lb/>
            How close he argues, and how well he pleads ? <lb/>
            Unhappy Basilus !-but he is wrong:<lb n="230"/>
            Would he procure subsistence by his tongue, <lb/>
            Let him renounce the forum, and withdraw <lb/>
            To Gaul, or Afric, the dry-nurse of law.</p>
          <p>But Vectius, yet more desperate than the rest, <lb/>
            Has opened (0 that adamantine breast!)<lb n="235"/>
            A RHETORIC school ; where striplings rave and storm <lb/>
            At tyranny, through many a crowded form.- <lb/>
            The exercises lately, sitting, read, <lb/>
            Standing, distract his miserable head, <lb/>
            And every day and every hour affords <lb n="240"/>
            The selfsame subjects, in the selfsame words ; <lb/>
            Till, like bashed cabbage served for each repast, <lb/>
            The repetition-kills the wretch at last!</p>
          <p>Where the main jet of every question lies, <lb/>
            And whence the chief objections may arise, <lb n="245"/>
            All wish to know; but none the price will pay. <lb/>
            " The price," retorts the scholar, " do you say ! <lb/>
            What have I learned ? " There go the master's pains, <lb/>
            Because, forsooth, the Arcadian brute lacks brains ! <lb/>
            And yet this oaf, every sixth morn, prepares<lb n="250"/>
            To split my head with Hannibal's affairs, <lb/>
            While he debates at large, " Whether 'twere right <lb/>
            " To take advantage of the general fright, <lb/>
            And march to Rome ; or, by the storm alarmed, <lb/>
            And all the elements against him armed, <lb n="255"/>
            The dangerous expedition to delay, <lb/>
            And lead his harassed troops some other way." <lb/>
            -Sick of the theme, which still returns, and still <lb/>
            The exhausted wretch exclaims, Ask what you will, <lb/>
            I'll give it, so you on his sire prevail,<lb n="260"/>
            To hear, thus oft, the booby's endless tale!</p>
          <p>So Vectius speeds : his brethren, wiser far, <lb/>
            Have shut up school, and hurried to the bar. <lb/>

            A long adieu ! on more productive themes, <lb/>

            Thou too, my friend, would'st thou my counsel hear, <lb n="270"/>
            Should'st free thyself from this ungrateful care ; <lb/>
            Lest all be lost, and thou reduced, poor sage, <lb/>
            To want a tally in thy helpless age ! <lb/>
            Bread still the lawyer earns; but tell me yet, <lb/>
            What your Chrysogonus and Pollio get, <lb n="275"/>
            (The chief of rhetoricians,) though they teach <lb/>
            Our youth of quality, THE ART OF SPEECH ?</p>
          <p>Oh, no ! the great pursue a nobler end :— <lb/>
            Five thousand on a bath they freely spend; <lb/>
            More on a portico, where, while it lours, <lb n="280"/>
            They ride, and bid defiance to the showers. <lb/>
            Shall they, for brighter skies, at home remain, <lb/>
            Or dash their pampered mules through mud and rain ? <lb/>
            No : let them pace beneath the stately roof, <lb/>
            For there no mire can soil the shining hoof.<lb n="285"/>
            </p>
          <p>See next, on proud Numidian columns rise <lb/>
            An eating-room, that fronts the eastern skies, <lb/>
            And drinks the cooler sun. Expensive these ! <lb/>
            But, (cost whate'er they may,) the times to please, <lb/>
            Sewers for arrangement of the board admired, <lb n="290"/>
            And cooks of taste and skill must yet be hired. <lb/>
            Mid this extravagance, which knows no bounds, <lb/>
            Quintilian gets, and hardly gets, ten pounds :— <lb/>
            On education all is grudged as lost, <lb/>
            And sons are still a father's lightest cost. <lb n="295"/>
            </p>
          <p>Whence has Quintilian, then, his vast estate ? <lb/>
            Urge not an instance of peculiar fate : <lb/>
            Perhaps, by luck. The lucky, I admit, <lb/>
            Have all advantages; have beauty, wit, <lb/>
            And wisdom, and high blood : the lucky,<lb n="300"/>
            May take, at will, the senatorial shoe ; <lb/>
            Be first-rate speakers, pleaders, every thing; <lb/>
            And, though they croak like frogs, be thought to sing.</p>
          <p>0, there's a difference, friend, beneath what sign <lb/>
            We spring to light, or kindly or malign ! <lb n="305"/>
            FORTUNE IS ALL : She, as the fancy springs, <lb/>
            Makes kings of pedants, and of pedants kings. <lb/>
            For, what were Tullius, and Ventidius, say, <lb/>
            But great examples of the wondrous sway <lb/>
            Of stars, whose mystic influence alone, <lb n="310"/>
            Bestows, on captives triumphs, slaves a throne ?</p>
          <p>He, then, is lucky; and, amidst the clan, <lb/>
            Ranks with the milk-white crow, or sable swan : <lb/>
            While all his hapless brethren count their gains, <lb/>
            And execrate, too late, their fruitless pains. <pb n="428"/>

            And spring eternal shed its influence there ! <lb/>
            You honoured tutors, now a slighted race, <lb/>

          <p>Achilles, grown a man, the lyre essayed <lb/>
            On his paternal hills, and, while he played, <lb/>
            With trembling eyed the rod ;-and yet, the tail <lb/>
            Of the good Centaur, scarcely, then, could fail <lb/>
            To force a smile : such reverence now is rare, <lb n="330"/>
            And boys with bibs strike Rufus on his chair, <lb/>
            Fastidious Rufus, who, with critic rage, <lb/>
            Arraigned the purity of Tully's page!</p>
          <p>Enough of these. Let the last wretched band, <lb/>
            The poor GRAMMARIANS, say, what liberal hand <lb n="335"/>
            Rewards their toil: let learned Palæmon tell, <lb/>
            Who proffers what his skill deserves so well. <lb/>
            Yet from this pittance, whatso'er it be, <lb/>
            (Less, surely, than the rhetorician's fee,) <lb/>
            The usher snips off something for his pains, <lb n="340"/>
            And the purveyor nibbles what remains. <lb/>
            Courage, Palæmon! be not over-nice, <lb/>
            But suffer some abatement in your price; <lb/>
            As those who deal in rugs, will ask you high, <lb/>
            And sink by pence, and half-pence, till you buy.<lb n="345"/>
            Yes, suffer this ; while something's left to pay <lb/>
            Your rising hours before the dawn of day, <lb/>
            When e'en the labouring poor their slumbers take, <lb/>
            And not a weaver, not a smith's awake : <lb/>
            While something's left to pay you for the stench <lb n="350"/>
            Of smouldering lamps, thick spread o'er every bench, <lb/>
            Where ropy vapours Virgil's pages soil, <lb/>
            And Horace looks one blot, all soot and oil!</p>
          <p>Even then, the stipend thus reduced, thus small, <lb/>
            Without a lawsuit, rarely comes at all. <lb n="355"/>
            </p>
          <p>Add yet, ye parents, add to the disgrace, <lb/>
            And heap new hardships on this wretched race. <lb/>
            Make it a point that all, and every part, <lb/>
            Of their own science, be possessed by heart; <lb/>
            That general history with our own they blend, <lb n="360"/>
            And have all authors at their fingers' end : <lb/>

            How long Acestes flourished, and what store <lb/>

            In proud display ; yet, take this truth from me, <lb/>
            VIRTUE ALONE IS TRUE NOBILITY. <lb/>
            Set Cossus, Drusus, Paulus, then, in view, <lb/>
            The bright example of their lives pursue; <lb/>
            Let these precede the statues of your race,<lb n="35"/>

          <p>O give me inborn worth ! Dare to be just, <lb/>

            These praises hear, at least deserve to hear, <lb/>
            I grant your claim, and recognise the peer.<lb n="40"/>
            Hail! from whatever stock you draw your birth, <lb/>

            All hail! in you, exulting Rome espies <lb/>
            Her guardian Power, her great Palladium rise ; <lb/>
            And shouts like Egypt, when her priests have found, <lb n="45"/>

          <p>But shall we call those noble, who disgrace <lb/>

            Vain thought !-but thus, with many a taunting smile, <lb/>
            The dwarf an Atlas, Moor a swan, we style ;<lb n="50"/>

            You, too, beware, lest Satire's piercing eye <lb n="55"/>

            Plautus, thy birth and folly make it thine.<lb n="60"/>
            Thou vaunt'st thy pedigree, on every side <lb/>

            As if thy honours by thyself were won, <lb/>
            And thou hadst some illustrious action done. <lb/>
            To make the world believe thee Julia's heir, <lb n="65"/>
            And not the offspring of some easy fair, <lb/>
            Who, shivering in the wind, near yon dead wall, <lb/>
            Plies her vile labour, and is all to all.</p>

            While thou, in mean, inglorious pleasure lost, <lb/>

            Whose footsteps, in the dust, are foremost still; <lb/>
            While Hirpine's stock are to the market led,<lb n="95"/>
            If Victory perch but rarely on their head : <lb/>
            For no respect to pedigree is paid, <lb/>
            No honour to a sire's illustrious shade. <lb/>
            Flung cheaply off, they drag the cumbrous wain, <lb/>
            With shoulders bare and bleeding from the chain ; <lb n="100"/>
            Or take, with some blind ass in concert found, <lb/>
            At Nepo's mill, their everlasting round.</p>
          <p>That Rome may, therefore, YOU, not YOURS, admire, <lb/>
            By virtuous actions, first, to praise aspire ; <lb/>
            Seek not to shine by borrowed light alone, <lb n="105"/>

            Haste then, Chærippus, ere thy rags be known, <lb/>

          <p>Not such the cries of old, nor such the stroke, <lb/>
            When first the nations bowed beneath our yoke. <lb/>
            Wealth, then, was theirs, wealth without fear possest, <lb/>
            Full every house, and bursting every chest- <lb n="150"/>
            Crimson, in looms of Sparta taught to glow, <lb/>
            And purple, deeply dyed in grain of Co ; <lb/>
            Busts, to which Myro's touch did motion give, <lb/>
            And ivory, taught by Phidias' skill to live ; <lb/>
            On every side a Polyclete you viewed,<lb n="155"/>
            And scarce a board without a Mentor stood. <lb/>
            These, these, the lust of rapine first inspired, <lb/>
            These, Antony and Dolabella fired, <lb/>
            And sacrilegious Yerres:—so, for Rome <lb/>
            They shipped their secret plunder; and brought home <lb n="160"/>
            More treasures from our friends, in peace obtained, <lb/>

            He laughed aloud to see the vulgar fears, <lb/>
            Laughed at their joys, and sometimes at their tears : <lb n="75"/>
            Secure the while, he mocked at Fortune's frown, <lb/>
            And when she threatened, bade her hang or drown ! <lb/>
            Superfluous then, or fatal, is the prayer, <lb/>

            For two poor claims have long renounced the whole, <lb/>
            And only ask,—the Circus and the Dole.</p>
          <p>" But there are more to suffer." " So I find ; <lb/>
            A fire so fierce for one was ne'er designed.<lb n="115"/>
            I met my friend Brutidius, and I fear, <lb/>
            From his pale looks, he thinks there’s danger near. <lb/>
            What if this Ajax, in his frenzy, strike, <lb/>
            Suspicious of our zeal, at all alike ! " <lb/>
            " True : fly we then, our loyalty to show; <lb n="120"/>
            And trample on the carcass of his foe, <lb/>
            While yet exposed on Tiber's banks it lies "— <lb/>

            " Yes ; let them (lest our ardour they forswear, <lb/>

            Give this to sway the army, that the state ; <lb/>
            And keep a prince in ward, retired to reign <lb/>
            O'er Capreæ’s crags, with his Chaldean train ? <lb/>
            Yes, yes, thou would'st (for I can read thy breast) <lb/>
            Enjoy that favour which he once possest, <lb n="135"/>
            Assume all offices, grasp all commands, <lb/>

            'Tis nature, this; even those who want the will, <lb/>
            Pant for the dreadful privilege to kill: <lb/>
            Yet what delight can rank and power bestow, <lb n="140"/>
            Since every joy is balanced by its woe ! <lb/>

            For when he begged for too much wealth and power, <lb n="150"/>
            Stage above stage, he raised a tottering tower, <lb/>

          <p>What wrought the Crassi, what the Pompeys' doom, <lb/>

          <p>But, (for 'tis good our humble hope to prove,) <lb/>
            That thou may'st, still, ask something from above ;<lb n="520"/>
            Thy pious offerings to the temple bear, <lb/>
            And, while the altars blaze, be this thy prayer.</p>
          <p>O THOU, who know'st the wants of human kind, <lb/>
            Vouchsafe me health of body, health of mind; <lb/>
            A soul prepared to meet the frowns of fate, <lb n="525"/>
            And look undaunted on a future state ; <lb/>
            That reckons death a blessing, yet can bear <lb/>
            Existence nobly, with its weight of care ; <lb/>
            That anger and desire alike restrains, <lb/>
            And counts Alcides' toils, and cruel pains,<lb n="530"/>
            Superior far to banquets, wanton nights, <lb/>
            And all the Assyrian monarch's soft delights !</p>
          <p>Here bound, at length, thy wishes. I but teach <lb/>
            What blessings man, by his own powers, may reach. <lb/>
            THE PATH TO PEACE IS VIRTUE. We should see, <lb n="535"/>
            If wise, 0 Fortune, nought divine in thee : <lb/>
            But we have deified a name alone, <lb/>
            And fixed in heaven thy visionary throne!</p><pb n="454"/>

          <p>IF Atticus in sumptuous fare delight, <lb/>
            'Tis taste : if Rutilus, 'tis madness quite : <lb/>
            And what diverts the sneering rabble more <lb/>
            Than an Apicius miserably poor ?</p>
          <p>In every company, go where you will,<lb n="5"/>
            Bath, forum, theatre, the talk is still <lb/>
            Of Rutilus!—While fit (tliey cry) -to wield, <lb/>
            With firm and vigorous arm, the spear and shield, <lb/>
            While his full veins beat high with youthful blood, <lb/>
            Forced by no tribune-yet by none withstood, <lb n="10"/>
            He cultivates the gladiator's trade, <lb/>
            And learns the imperious language of the blade.</p>
          <p>What swarms we see of this degenerate kind ! <lb/>
            Swarms whom their creditors can only find <lb/>
            At flesh and fish-stalls :—thither they repair, <lb n="15"/>
            Sure, though deceived at home, to catch them there. <lb/>
            These live but for their palate ; and, of these, <lb/>
            The most distressed, (while Ruin hastes to seize <lb/>
            The crumbling mansion and disparting wall,) <lb/>
            Spread richer feasts, and riot as they fall !- <lb n="20"/>
            Meanwhile, ere yet the last supply be spent, <lb/>
            They search for dainties every element, <lb/>
            Awed by no price ; nay, making this their boast, <lb/>
            And still preferring that which costs them most, <lb/>
            Joyous, and reckless of to-morrow's fate,<lb n="25"/>
            To raise a desperate sum, they pledge their plate, <lb/>
            Or mother's fractured image ; to prepare <lb/>
            Yet one treat more, though but in earthen ware! <lb/>
            Then to the fencer's mess they come, of course, <lb/>
            And mount the scaffold as a last resource. <lb n="30"/>

          <p>No foe to sumptuous boards, I only scan, <lb/>
            When such are spread, the motives, and the man, <lb/>
            And praise or censure, as I see the feast <lb/>
            Or by the noble or the beggar drest : <lb/>
            In this, 'tis gluttony ; in that, fit pride,<lb n="35"/>
            Sanctioned by wealth, by station dignified.— <lb/>
            Whip me the fool, who marks how Atlas soars <lb/>

            Nor, when thy purse will scarce a gudgeon buy, <lb/>

            At length, when nought remains a meal to bring, <lb/>
            The last poor shift, off comes the knightly ring, <lb n="60"/>
            And " sad Sir Pollio " begs his daily fare, <lb/>
            With undistinguished hands, and finger bare!</p>
          <p>To these, an early grave no terror brings. <lb/>
            " A short and merry life ! " the spendthrift sings ; <lb/>
            Death seems to him a refuge from despair,<lb n="65"/>
            And far less terrible than hoary hair.</p>
          <p>Mark now the progress of their rapid fate! <lb/>
            Money, (regardless of the monthly rate,) <lb/>
            On every side, they borrow, and apace, <lb/>
            Waste what is raised before the lender's face: <lb n="70"/>
            Then, while they yet some wretched remnant hold, <lb/>
            And the pale usurer trembles for his gold, <lb/>
            They wisely sicken for the country air, <lb/>
            And flock to Baiæ, Ostia, Jove knows where.- <lb/>
            For now 'tis held (so rife the evil's grown) <lb n="75"/>
            No greater shame, for debt, to flee the town, <lb/>
            Than from the thronged Suburra to remove, <lb/>
            In dog-days, to the Esquilian shades above. <lb/>
            One thought alone, what time they leave behind <lb/>
            Friends, country, all, weighs heavy on their mind, <lb n="80"/>
            One thought alone,-for twelve long months to lose <lb/>
            The dear delights of Rome, the public shows! <lb/>
            Where sleeps the modest blood ! In all our veins, <lb/>
            No conscious drop, to form a blush, remains : <lb/>
            SHAME, from the town, derided, speeds her way,<lb n="85"/>
            And few, alas! solicit her to stay.</p>
          <p>Enough : to-day my Persicus shall see <lb/>
            Whether my precepts with my life agree ; <lb/>
            Whether, with feigned austerity, I prize <lb/>
            The spare repast, a glutton in disguise!<lb n="90"/>
            Bawl for coarse pottage, that my friends may hear, <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> SAT. XI. </note> <lb/>
            For since, by promise, you are now my guest, <lb/>
            Know, I invite you to no sumptuous feast, <lb/>
            But to such simple fare, as long, long since, <lb n="95"/>
            The good Evander bade the Trojan prince. <lb/>
            Come then, my friend, you will not, sure, despise <lb/>
            The food that pleased the offspring of the skies ; <lb/>
            Come, and while fancy brings past times to view, <lb/>
            I 'll think myself the king, the hero you.<lb n="100"/>
            </p>
          <p>Take now your bill of fare • my simple board <lb/>
            with no dainties from the market stored, <lb/>
            But dishes all my own. From Tibur's stock <lb/>
            A kid shall come, the fattest of the flock, <lb/>
            The tenderest too, and yet too young to browse <lb n="105"/>
            The thistle's shoots, the willow's watery boughs, <lb/>
            With more of milk than blood ; and pullets drest <lb/>
            With new-laid eggs, yet tepid from the nest, <lb/>
            And sperage wild, which, from the mountain's side, <lb/>
            My housemaid left her spindle to provide ; <lb n="110"/>
            And grapes long kept, yet pulpy still, and fair, <lb/>
            And the rich Signian and the Syrian pear ; <lb/>
            And apples, that in flavour and in smell <lb/>
            The boasted Picene equal, or excel :- <lb/>
            Nor need you fear, my friend, their liberal use, <lb n="115"/>
            For age has mellowed and improved their juice.</p>
          <p>How homely this! and yet this homely fare <lb/>
            A senator would, once, have counted rare ; <lb/>
            When the good Curius thought it no disgrace <lb/>
            O'er a few sticks a little pot to place, <lb n="120"/>
            With herbs by his small garden-plot supplied- <lb/>
            Food, which the squalid wretch would now deride, <lb/>
            Who digs in fetters, and, with fond regret, <lb/>
            The tavern's savoury dish remembers yet!</p>
          <p>Time was, when, on the rack, a man would lay <lb n="125"/>
            The seasoned flitch, against a solemn day ; <lb/>
            And think the friends who met, with decent mirth, <lb/>
            To celebrate the hour which gave him birth, <lb/>
            On this, and what of fresh the altars spared, <lb/>
            (For altars then were honoured,) nobly fared.<lb n="130"/>
            Some kinsman, who had camps and senates swayed, <lb/>
            Had thrice been consul, once dictator made, <lb/>
            From public cares retired, would gaily haste, <lb/>
            Before the wonted hour, to such repast, <lb/>
            Shouldering the spade, that, with no common toil, <lb n="135"/>
            Had tamed the genius of the mountain soil.- <lb/>
            the Fabian name, <lb/>
            The Scauran, and Fabrician ; when they saw <lb/>
            A censor's rigour even a censor awe, 140 <pb n="457"/>
            <note type="margin"> SAT. XI. </note> <lb/>
            No son of Troy e'er thought it his concern, <lb/>
            Or worth a moment's serious care, to learn, <lb/>
            What land, what sea, the fairest tortoise bred, <lb/>
            Whose clouded shell might best adorn his bed.- <lb/>
            His bed was small, and did no signs impart<lb n="145"/>
            Or of the painter's or the sculptor's art, <lb/>
            Save where the front, cheaply inlaid with brass, <lb/>
            Showed the rude features of a vine-crowned ass ; <lb/>
            An uncouth brute, round which his children played, <lb/>
            And laughed and jested at the face it made !<lb n="150"/>
            Briefly, his house, his furniture, his food, <lb/>
            Were uniformly plain, and simply good.</p>
          <p>Then the rough soldier, yet untaught by Greece <lb/>
            To hang, enraptured, o'er a finished piece, <lb/>
            If haply, mid the congregated spoils, <lb n="155"/>
            (Proofs of his power, and guerdon of his toils,) <lb/>
            Some antique vase of master-hands were found, <lb/>
            Would dash the glittering bauble on the ground ; <lb/>
            That, in new forms, the molten fragments drest, <lb/>
            Might blaze illustrious round his courser's chest,<lb n="160"/>
            Or, flashing from his burnished helmet, show <lb/>
            (A dreadful omen to the trembling foe) <lb/>
            The mighty sire, with glittering shield and spear, <lb/>
            Hovering, enamoured, o'er the sleeping fair, <lb/>
            The wolf, by Rome's high destinies made mild, <lb n="165"/>
            And, playful at her side, each wondrous child.</p>
          <p>Thus, all the wealth those simple times could boast, <lb/>
            Small wealth ! their horses and their arms engrost; <lb/>
            The rest was homely, and their frugal fare, <lb/>
            Cooked without art, was served in earthen ware : <lb n="170"/>
            Yet worthy all our envy, were the breast <lb/>
            But with one spark of noble spleen possest. <lb/>
            THEN shone the fanes with majesty divine, <lb/>
            A present god was felt at every shrine ! <lb/>
            And solemn sounds, heard from the sacred walls, <lb n="175"/>
            At midnight's solemn hour, announced the Gauls, <lb/>
            Now rushing from the main ; while, prompt to save, <lb/>
            Stood Jove, the prophet of the signs he gave ! <lb/>
            Yet, when he thus revealed the will of fate, <lb/>
            And watched attentive o'er the Latian state, <lb n="180"/>
            His shrine, his statue, rose of humble mould, <lb/>
            Of artless form, and unprofaned with gold.</p>
          <p>Those good old times no foreign tables sought; <lb/>
            From their own woods the walnut tree was brought, <lb/>
            When withering limbs declared its pith unsound, <lb n="185"/>
            Or winds uptore, and stretched it on the ground. <lb/>
            But now, such strange caprice has seized the great, <lb/>
            They find no pleasure in the costliest treat, <pb n="458"/>
            <note type="margin"> SAT. XI. </note> <lb/>
            Suspect the flowers a sickly scent exhale, <lb/>
            And think the ven'son rank, the turbot stale, <lb n="190"/>
            Unless wide-yawning panthers, towering high- <lb/>
            Enormous pedestals of ivory, <lb/>
            Formed of the teeth which Elephantis sends, <lb/>
            Which the dark Moor, or darker Indian, vends, <lb/>
            Or those which, now, too heavy for the head, <lb n="195"/>
            The beasts in Nabathea's forest shed- <lb/>
            The spacious ORBS support: then they can feed, <lb/>
            And every dish is delicate indeed ! <lb/>
            For silver feet are viewed with equal scorn, <lb/>
            As iron rings upon the finger worn.<lb n="200"/>
            </p>
          <p>To me, for ever be the guest unknown, <lb/>
            Who, measuring my expenses by his own, <lb/>
            Remarks the difference with a scornful leer, <lb/>
            And slights my humble house and homely cheer. <lb/>
            Look not to me for ivory ; I have none :<lb n="205"/>
            My chess-board and my men are all of bone ; <lb/>
            Nay, my knife-handles ; yet, my friend, for this, <lb/>
            My pullets neither cut nor taste amiss.</p>
          <p>I boast no artist, tutored in the school <lb/>
            Of learned Trypherus, to carve by rule ;<lb n="210"/>
            Where large sow-paps of elm, and boar, and hare, <lb/>
            And phœnicopter, and pygargus rare, <lb/>
            Getulian oryx, Scythian pheasants, point, <lb/>
            The nice anatomy of every joint; <lb/>
            And dull blunt tools, severing the wooden treat,<lb n="215"/>
            Clatter around, and deafen all the street. <lb/>
            My simple lad, whose highest efforts rise <lb/>
            To broil a steak in the plain country guise, <lb/>
            Knows no such art; humbly content to serve, <lb/>
            And bring the dishes which he cannot kerve. <lb n="220"/>
            Another lad, (for I have two to-day,) <lb/>
            Clad, like the first, in home-spun russet grey, <lb/>
            Shall fill our earthen bowls : no Phrygian he, <lb/>
            No pampered attribute of luxury, <lb/>
            But a rude rustic :-when you want him, speak, <lb n="225"/>
            And speak in Latin, for he knows not Greek. <lb/>
            Both go alike, with close-crept hair, undrest, <lb/>
            But spruced to-day in honour of my guest; <lb/>
            And both were born on my estate, and one <lb/>
            Is my rough shepherd's, one, my neatherd's son. <lb n="230"/>
            Poor youth ! he mourns, with many an artless tear, <lb/>
            His long, long absence from his mother dear ; <lb/>
            Sighs for his little cottage, and would fain <lb/>
            Meet his old play fellows, the goats, again. <lb/>
            Though humble be his birth, ingenuous grace <lb n="235"/>
            Beams from his eye, and flushes in his face ; <pb n="459"/>
            <note type="margin"> SAT. XI. </note> <lb/>
            Charming suffusion ! that would well become <lb/>
            The youthful offspring of the chiefs of Rome.— <lb/>
            He, Persicus, shall fill us wine which grew <lb/>
            Where first the breath of life the stripling drew,<lb n="240"/>
            On Tibur's hills ;-dear hills, that, many a day <lb/>
            Witnessed the transports of his infant play.</p>
          <p>But you, perhaps, expect a wanton throng <lb/>
            Of Gaditanian girls, with dance and song, <lb/>
            To kindle loose desire ; girls, that now bound <lb n="245"/>
            Aloft with active grace, now, on the ground, } <lb/>
            Quivering, alight, while peals of praise go round. <lb/>
            Lo ! wives, beside their husbands placed, behold, <lb/>
            What could not in their ear, for shame, be told <lb/>
            Expedients of the rich, the blood to fire, <lb n="250"/>
            And wake the dying embers of desire. <lb/>
            Behold ? 0 heavens ! they view, with keenest gust, <lb/>
            These strong provocatives of jaded lust; <lb/>
            With every gesture feel their passions rise, <lb/>
            And draw in pleasure both at ears and eyes ! <lb n="255"/>
            </p>
          <p>Such vicious fancies are too great for me. <lb/>
            Let him the wanton dance unblushing see, <lb/>

            The proud expansion of a marble floor : <lb/>
            For there the world a large allowance make, <lb/>
            And spare the folly for the fortune's sake.- <lb/>
            Dice, and adultery, with a small estate, <lb/>
            Are damning crimes; but venial, with a great;<lb n="265"/>
            Venial ? nay, graceful: witty, gallant, brave, <lb/>
            And such wild tricks " as gentlemen should have !"</p>
          <p>My feast, to-day, shall other joys afford : <lb/>
            Hushed as we sit around the frugal board, <lb/>
            Great Homer shall his deep-toned thunder roll, <lb n="270"/>
            'And mighty Maro elevate the soul; <lb/>
            Maro, who, warmed with all the poet's fire, <lb/>
            Disputes the palm of victory with his sire : <lb/>
            Nor fear my rustic clerks; read as they will, <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Come then, my friend, an hour to pleasure spare, <lb/>
            And quit awhile your business and your care ; <lb/>
            The day is all our own : come, and forget <lb/>
            Bonds, interest, all; the credit and the debt; <lb/>
            Nay, e'en your wife : though, with the dawning light,<lb n="280"/>
            She left your couch, and late returned at night; <lb/>

            There leave the thoughts of home, and what the haste <lb/>
            Of heedless slaves may in your absence waste; <lb/>
            And, what the generous spirit most offends, <lb/>
            0, more than all, leave there, UNGRATEFUL FRIENDS.</p>
          <p>But see! the napkin, waved aloft, proclaims <lb n="290"/>
            The glad commencement of the Idæan games, <lb/>
            And the proud prætor, in triumphal state, <lb/>
            Ascends his car, the arbiter of fate ! <lb/>
            Ere this, all Rome (if 'tis, for once, allowed, <lb/>
            To say all Rome, of so immense a crowd) <lb n="295"/>
            The Circus throngs, and—Hark ! loud shouts arise- <lb/>
            From these, I guess the GREEN has won the prize; <lb/>
            For had it lost, all joy had been supprest, <lb/>
            And grief and horror seized the public breast; <lb/>
            As when dire Carthage forced our arms to yield, <lb n="300"/>
            And poured our noblest blood on Cannæ's field.</p>
          <p>Thither let youth, whom it befits, repair, <lb/>
            And seat themselves beside some favourite fair, <lb/>
            Wrangle, and urge the desperate bet aloud ; <lb/>
            While we, retired from business and the crowd, <lb n="305"/>
            Stretch our shrunk limbs by sunny bank or stream, <lb/>
            And drink, at every pore, the vernal beam. <lb/>
            Haste, then : for we may use our freedom now, <lb/>
            And bathe, an hour ere noon, with fearless brow- <lb/>
            Indulge for once :-Yet such delights as these, <lb n="310"/>
            In five short morns, would lose the power to please ; <lb/>
            For still, the sweetest pleasures soonest cloy, <lb/>
            And its best flavour temperance gives to joy.</p>

            The luscious juices of Clitumnus' plains, <lb/>
            Fatter than fat Hispulla, huge and slow, <lb/>

            Fall for my friend, who now, from danger free, <lb/>
            Revolves the recent perils of the sea ; <lb n="20"/>
            Shrinks at the roaring waves, the howling winds, <lb/>
            And scarcely trusts the safety which he finds !</p>
          <p>For not the gods' inevitable fire, <lb/>
            The surging billows that to heaven aspire, <lb/>
            Alone, perdition threat; black clouds arise, <lb n="25"/>
            And blot out all the splendour of the skies ; <lb/>
            Loud and more loud the thunder's voice is heard, <lb/>
            And sulphurous fires flash dreadful on the yard.- <lb/>
            Trembled the crew, and, fixed in wild amaze, <lb/>
            Saw the rent sails burst into sudden blaze ;<lb n="30"/>
            While shipwreck, late so dreadful, now appeared <lb/>
            A refuge from the flames, more wished than feared. <lb/>
            Horror on horror! earth, and sea, and skies, <lb/>
            Convulsed, as when POETIC TEMPESTS rise!</p>
          <p>From the same source another danger view, <lb n="35"/>
            With pitying eye,—though dire alas! not new ; <lb/>
            But known too well, as Isis' temples show, <lb/>
            By many a pictured scene of votive woe ; <lb/>
            Isis, by whom the painters now are fed, <lb/>
            Since our own gods no longer yield them bread !—<lb n="40"/>
            And such befell our friend : for now a sea, <lb/>
            Upsurging, poured tremendous o'er the lee, <lb/>
            And filled the hold; while, pressed by wave and wind, <lb/>
            To right and left, by turns, the ship inclined : <lb/>
            Then, while Catullus viewed, with drooping heart,<lb n="45"/>
            The storm prevailing o'er the pilot's art, <lb/>
            He wisely hastened to compound the strife, <lb/>
            And gave his treasure to preserve his life. <lb/>
            The beaver thus to scape his hunter tries, <lb/>
            And leaves behind the medicated prize ; <lb n="50"/>
            Happy to purchase, with his dearest blood, <lb/>
            A timely refuge in the well-known flood.</p>
          <p>" Away with all that's mine," he cries, "away!" <lb/>
            And plunges in the deep, without delay, <lb/>
            Purples, which soft Mæcenases might wear,<lb n="55"/>
            Crimsons, deep-tinctured in the Bætic air, <lb/>
            Where herbs, and springs of secret virtues, stain <lb/>
            The flocks at feed, with Nature's richest grain. <lb/>
            With these, neat baskets from the Britons bought, <lb/>
            Rare silver chargers by Parthenius wrought, <pb n="462"/>
            <note type="margin"> SAT. XII. </note> <lb n="60"/>
            A huge two-handed goblet, which might strain <lb/>
            A Pholus, or a Fuscus' wife, to drain ; <lb/>
            Followed by numerous services of plate, <lb/>
            Plain, and enchased ; with cups of ancient date, <lb/>
            In which, while at the city's strength he laughed, <lb n="65"/>
            The wily chapman of Olynthus quaffed. <lb/>
            Yet show me, in this elemental strife, <lb/>
            Another, who would barter wealth for life !— <lb/>
            Few GAIN TO LIVE, Corvinus, few or none, <lb/>
            But, blind with avarice, LIVE TO GAIN alone. <lb n="70"/>
            </p>
          <p>Now had the deep devoured their richest store ; <lb/>
            Nor seems their safety nearer than before: <lb/>
            The last resource alone was unexplored- <lb/>
            To cut the mast and rigging by the board ; <lb/>
            Haply the vessel so might steadier ride <lb n="75"/>
            O'er the vexed surface of the raging tide. <lb/>
            Dire threats the impending blow, when, thus distrest, <lb/>
            We sacrifice a part, to save the rest!</p>
          <p>Go now, fond man, the faithless ocean brave, <lb/>
            Commit your fortune to the wind and wave ;<lb n="80"/>
            Trust to a plank, and draw precarious breath, <lb/>
            At most, seven inches from the jaws of death ! <lb/>
            Go, but forget not that a storm may rise, <lb/>
            And put up hatchets with your sea supplies.</p>
          <p>But now the winds were hushed ; the wearied main<lb n="85"/>
            Sunk to repose, a calm, unruffled plain ; <lb/>
            For fate, superior to the tempest's power, <lb/>
            Averted from my friend the mortal hour : <lb/>
            A whiter thread the cheerful Sisters spun, <lb/>
            And lo, with favouring hands their spindles run! <lb n="90"/>
            Mild as the breeze of eve, a rising gale <lb/>
            Rippled the wave, and filled their only sail; <lb/>
            Others the crew supplied, of vests combined, <lb/>
            And spread to catch each vagrant breath of wind : <lb/>
            By aids like these, slow o'er the deep impelled,<lb n="95"/>
            The shattered bark her course for Ostia held; <lb/>
            While the glad sun uprose, supremely bright, <lb/>
            And hope returned with the returning light.</p>
          <p>At length the heights, where, from Lavinum moved, <lb/>
            Iülus built the city which he loved, <lb n="100"/>
            Burst on the view; auspicious heights! whose name <lb/>
            From a white sow and thirty sucklings came. <lb/>
            And now, the port they gain ; the tower, whose ray <lb/>
            Guides the poor wanderer o'er the watery way, <lb/>
            And the huge mole, whose arms the waves embrace, <lb n="105"/>
            And stretching, an immeasurable space, <lb/>
            Far into Ocean's bosom, leave the coast, <lb/>
            Till, in the distance, Italy is lost!- <pb n="463"/>
            <note type="margin"> SAT. XII. </note> <lb/>
            Less wonderful the bays which Nature forms, <lb/>
            And less secure against assailing storms : <lb n="110"/>
            Here rides the wave-worn bark, devoid of fear ; <lb/>
            For Baian skiffs might ply with safety here. <lb/>
            The joyful crew, with shaven crowns, relate <lb/>
            Their timely rescue from the jaws of fate ; <lb/>
            On every ill a pomp of words bestow, <lb n="115"/>
            And dwell delighted on the tale of woe.</p>
          <p>Go then, my boys-but let no boding strain <lb/>
            Break on the sacred silence-dress the fane <lb/>
            With garlands, bind the sod with ribands gay, <lb/>
            And on the knives the salted offering lay : <lb n="120"/>
            This done, I'11 speed, myself the rites to share, <lb/>
            And finish what remains, with pious care. <lb/>
            Then, hastening home, where chaplets of sweet flowers <lb/>
            Bedeck my Lares, dear, domestic Powers! <lb/>
            I '11 offer incense there, and at the shrine <lb n="125"/>
            Of highest Jove, my father's god, and mine ; <lb/>
            There will I scatter every bud that blows, <lb/>
            And every tint the various violet knows. <lb/>
            All savours here of joy : luxuriant bay } <lb/>
            O'ershades my portal, while the taper's ray <lb n="130"/>
            Anticipates the feast, and chides the tardy day.</p>
          <p>Nor think, Corvinus, interest fires my breast : <lb/>
            Catullus, for whose sake my house is drest, <lb/>
            Has three sweet boys, who all such hopes destroy, <lb/>
            And nobler views excite my boundless joy. <lb n="135"/>
            Yet who besides, on such a barren friend, <lb/>
            Would waste a sickly pullet? who would spend <lb/>
            So vast a treasure, where no hopes prevail, <lb/>
            Or, for a FATHER, sacrifice a quail ?—</p>
          <p>But should the symptoms of a slight disease <lb n="140"/>
            The childless Paccius or Gallita seize, <lb/>
            Legions of flatterers to the fanes repair, <lb/>
            And hang in rows their votive tablets there. <lb/>
            Nay, some with vows of hecatombs will come- <lb/>
            For yet no elephants are sold at Rome ; <lb n="145"/>
            The breed, to Latium and to us unknown, <lb/>
            Is only found beneath the burning zone : <lb/>
            Thence to our shore, by swarthy Moors conveyed, <lb/>
            They roam at large through the Rutulian shade, <lb/>
            Kept for the imperial pleasure, envied fate ! <lb n="150"/>
            And sacred from the subject, and the state. <lb/>
            Though their progenitors, in days of yore, <lb/>
            Did worthy service, and to battle bore <lb/>
            Whole cohorts ; taught the general's voice to know, <lb/>
            And rush, themselves an army, on the foe. <pb n="464"/>

            So rare a creature, worth might plead in vain : <lb/>
            Novins, without delay, their blood would shed, <lb/>
            To raise his Paccius from affliction's bed; <lb/>
            An offering, sacred to the great design, <lb n="160"/>
            And worthy of the votary and the shrine !</p>
          <p>Pacuvius, did our laws the crime allow, <lb/>
            The fairest of his numerous slaves would vow ; <lb/>
            The blooming boy, the love-inspiring maid, <lb/>
            With garlands crown, and to the temple lead; <lb n="165"/>
            Nay, seize his Iphigene, prepared to wed, <lb/>
            And drag her to the altar, from the bed ; <lb/>
            Though hopeless, like the Grecian sire, to find, <lb/>
            In happy hour, the substituted hind.</p>
          <p>And who shall say my countryman does ill ?<lb n="170"/>
            A thousand ships are trifles to a Will! <lb/>
            For Paccius, should the fates his health restore, <lb/>
            May cancel every item framed before, <lb/>
            (Won by his friend's vast merits, and beset, <lb/>
            On all sides, by the inextricable net,) <lb n="175"/>
            And, in one line, convey plate, jewels, gold, <lb/>
            Lands, every thing to him, " to have and hold." <lb/>
            With victory crowned, Pacuvius struts along, <lb/>
            And smiles contemptuous on the baffled throng ; <lb/>
            Then counts his gains, and deems himself o'erpaid <lb n="180"/>
            For the cheap murder of one wretched maid.</p>
          <p>Health to the man! and may he THUS get more <lb/>
            Than Nero plundered ! pile his shining store <lb/>
            High, mountain high ; in years a Nestor prove, <lb/>

          <p>MAN, wretched man, whene'er he stoops to sin, <lb/>
            Feels, with the act, a strong remorse within ; <lb/>
            'Tis the first vengeance : Conscience tries the cause, <lb/>

            Call heaven and earth to witness the deceit, <lb n="40"/>
            With cries as deafening, as the shout that breaks <lb/>
            From the bribed audience, when Fæsidius speaks.</p>
          <p>Dotard in nonage! are you to be told <lb/>
            What loves, what graces, deck another's gold ? <lb/>
            Are you to learn, what peals of mirth resound,<lb n="45"/>
            At your simplicity, from all around ? <lb/>
            When you step forth, and, with a serious air, <lb/>

            To tempt the altars,-for A GOD IS THERE !</p>
          <p>Idle old man ! there was, indeed, a time, <lb n="50"/>
            When the rude natives of this happy clime <lb/>
            Cherished such dreams : 'twas ere the king of heaven, <lb/>
            To change his sceptre for a scythe was driven; <lb/>
            Ere Juno yet the sweets of love had tried, <lb/>
            Or Jove advanced beyond the caves of Ide.<lb n="55"/>
            'Twas when no gods indulged in sumptuous feasts, <lb/>
            No Ganymede, no Hebe served the guests ; <lb/>
            No Vulcan, with his sooty labours foul, <lb/>
            Limped round, officious, with the nectared bowl ; <note type="footnote"> 2 H </note> <pb n="466"/>
            <note type="margin"> SAT. XIII. </note> <lb/>
            But each in private dined : 'twas when the throng <lb n="60"/>
            Of godlings, now beyond the scope of song, <lb/>
            The courts of heaven, in spacious ease, possest, <lb/>
            And with a lighter load poor Atlas prest !— <lb/>
            Ere Neptune's lot the watery world obtained, <lb/>
            Or Dis and his Sicilian consort reigned; <lb n="65"/>
            Ere Tityus and his ravening bird were known, <lb/>
            Ixion's wheel, or Sisyphus's stone : <lb/>
            While yet the shades confessed no tyrant's power, <lb/>
            And all below was one Elysian bower !</p>
          <p>Vice was a phoenix in that blissful time,<lb n="70"/>
            Believed, but never seen : and 'twas a crime, <lb/>
            Worthy of death, such awe did years engage, <lb/>
            If manhood rose not up to reverend age, <lb/>
            And youth to manhood, though a larger hoard <lb/>
            Of hips and acorns graced the stripling's board.<lb n="75"/>
            Then, then was age so venerable thought, <lb/>
            That every day increase of honour brought; <lb/>
            And children, in the springing down, revered <lb/>
            The sacred promise of a hoary beard!</p>
          <p>Now, if a friend, miraculously just, <lb n="80"/>
            Restore the pledge, with all its gathered rust, <lb/>
            'Tis deemed a portent, worthy to appear <lb/>
            Among the wonders of the Tuscan year ; <lb/>
            A prodigy of faith, which threats the state, <lb/>
            And a ewe lamb can scarcely expiate!-<lb n="85"/>
            Struck at the view, if now I chance to see <lb/>
            A man of ancient worth and probity, <lb/>
            To preguant mules the MONSTER I compare, <lb/>
            Or fish upturned beneath the wondering share : <lb/>
            Anxious and trembling for the woe to come, <lb n="90"/>
            As if a shower of stones had fallen on Rome ; <lb/>
            As if a swarm of bees, together clung, <lb/>
            Down from the Capitol, thick-clustering, hung ; <lb/>
            Or Tiber, swollen to madness, burst away, <lb/>
            And roll'd, a milky deluge, to the sea. <lb n="95"/>
            </p>
          <p>And dost thou at a trivial loss repine ! <lb/>
            What, if another, by a friend like thine, <lb/>
            Is stript of ten times more ! a third, again, <lb/>
            Of what his bursting chest would scarce contain ! <lb/>
            For 'tis so common, in this age of ours, <lb n="100"/>
            So easy, to contemn the Immortal Powers, <lb/>
            That, can we but elude man's searching eyes, <lb/>
            We laugh to scorn the witness of the skies. <lb/>
            Mark, with how bold a voice, and fixed a brow, <lb/>
            The villain dares his treachery disavow <lb n="105"/>
            " By the all-hallowed orb that flames above, <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> SAT. XIII. </note> <lb/>
            By the winged shaft that laid the Centaur low, <lb/>
            By Dian's arrows, by Apollo's bow, <lb/>
            By the strong lance that Mars delights to wield, <lb n="110"/>
            By Neptune's trident, by Minerva's shield, <lb/>
            And every weapon that, to vengeance given, <lb/>
            Stores the tremendous magazine of heaven!- <lb/>
            Nay, IF I HAD, I'll slay this son of mine, <lb/>
            And eat his head, soused in Egyptian brine." <lb n="115"/>
            </p>
          <p>There are, who think that chance is all in all, <lb/>
            That no First Cause directs the eternal ball; <lb/>
            But that brute Nature, in her blind career, <lb/>
            Varies the seasons, and brings round the year : <lb/>
            These rush to every shrine, with equal ease, <lb n="120"/>
            And, owning none, swear by what Power you please.</p>
          <p>Others believe, and but believe, a god, <lb/>
            And think that punishment MAY follow fraud ; <lb/>
            Yet they forswear, and, reasoning on the deed, <lb/>
            Thus reconcile their actions with their creed :<lb n="125"/>
            " Let Isis storm, if to revenge inclined, <lb/>
            And with her angry sistrum strike me blind, <lb/>
            So, with my eyes, she ravish not my ore, <lb/>
            But let me keep the pledge which I forswore. <lb/>
            Are putrid sores, catarrhs that seldom kill, <lb n="130"/>
            And crippled limbs, forsooth, so great an ill! <lb/>
            Ladas, if not stark mad, would change, no doubt, <lb/>
            His flying feet for riches and the gout ;; <lb/>
            For what do those procure him ? mere renown, <lb/>
            And the starved honour of an olive crown. <lb n="135"/>
            </p>
          <p>" But grant the wrath of heaven be great; 'tis slow, <lb/>
            And days, and months, and years, precede the blow. <lb/>
            If, then, to punish ALL, the gods decree, <lb/>
            When, in their vengeance, will they come to me ? <lb/>
            But I, perhaps, their anger may appease-<lb n="140"/>
            For they are wont to pardon faults like these : <lb/>
            At worst, there's hope; since every age and clime <lb/>
            See different fates attend the self-same crime ; <lb/>
            Some made by villany, and some undone, <lb/>
            And this ascend a scaffold, that a throne." <lb n="145"/>
            </p>
          <p>These sophistries, to fix awhile suffice <lb/>
            The mind, yet shuddering at the thought of vice ; <lb/>
            And, thus confirmed, at the first call they come, <lb/>
            Nay, rush before you to the sacred dome : <lb/>
            Chide your slow pace, drag you, amazed, along, <lb n="150"/>
            And play the raving Phasma, to the throng. <lb/>
            (For impudence the vulgar suffrage draws, <lb/>

            'Tis just :-for thus our losses we declare ; <lb n="175"/>
            And money is bewailed with deeper sighs, <lb/>
            Than friends or kindred, and with louder cries. <lb/>
            There none dissemble, none, with scenic art, <lb/>
            Affect a sorrow, foreign from the heart; <lb/>
            Content in squalid garments to appear, <lb n="180"/>
            And vex their lids for one hard-gotten tear : <lb/>
            No, genuine drops fall copious from their eyes, <lb/>
            And their breasts labour with unbidden sighs. <lb/>
            But when you see each court of justice thronged <lb/>
            With crowds, like you, by faithless friendship wronged, <lb n="185"/>
            See men abjure their bonds, though duly framed, <lb/>

            While their own hand and seal, in every eye, <lb/>

            Or what to those, who, with pernicious craft, <lb/>
            Mingle and set to sale the deadly draught; <lb/>

            From light's first dawning, till it disappears! <lb n="215"/>
            The state of morals would you learn at Rome ? <lb/>
            No further seek than his judicial dome : <lb/>
            Give one short morning to the horrors there, <lb/>
            And then complain, then murmur, if you dare!</p>
          <p>Say, whom do goitres on the Alps surprise ? <lb n="220"/>

            Whom locks, in Germany, of golden hue, <lb/>
            And spiral curls, and eyes of sapphire blue ? <lb/>
            None ; for the prodigy, among them shared, <lb/>
            Becomes mere nature, and escapes regard. <lb n="225"/>
            When clouds of Thracian birds obscure the sky, <lb/>
            To arms! to arms ! the desperate Pigmies cry : <lb/>
            But soon, defeated in the unequal fray, <lb/>

            The victor cranes descend, and, clamouring, bear <lb n="230"/>
            The wriggling mannikins aloft in air. <lb/>
            Here, could our climes to such a scene give birth, <lb/>
            We all should burst with agonies of mirth ; <lb/>
            There, unsurprised, they view the frequent fight, <lb/>

            Yet still your loss, your injury would remain, <lb n="240"/>

          <p>But why are those, Calvinus, thought to scape <lb/>
            Unpunished, whom, in every fearful shape, <lb/>
            Guilt still alarms, and conscience, ne'er asleep, <lb/>
            Wounds with incessant strokes, " not loud but deep," <lb/>
            While the vexed mind, her own tormentor, plies<lb n="265"/>
            A scorpion scourge, unmarked by human eyes! <lb/>
            Trust me, no tortures which the poets feign, <lb/>
            Can match the fierce, the unutterable pain <lb/>
            He feels, who night and day, devoid of rest, <lb/>
            Carries his own accuser in his breast.<lb n="270"/>
            </p>
          <p>A Spartan once the Oracle besought <lb/>
            To solve a scruple which perplexed his thought, <lb/>
            And plainly tell him, if be might forswear <lb/>
            A purse, of old confided to his care. <lb/>
            Incensed, the priestess answered—“ Waverer, no! <lb n="275"/>
            Nor shalt thou, for the doubt, unpunished go." <lb/>
            With that, he hastened to restore the trust; <lb/>
            But fear alone, not virtue, made him just: <lb/>
            Hence, he soon proved the Oracle divine, <lb/>
            And all the answer worthy of the shrine ; <lb n="280"/>
            For plagues pursued his race without delay, <lb/>
            And swept them from the earth, like dust, away. <lb/>
            By such dire sufferings did the wretch atone <lb/>
            The crime of meditated fraud alone ! <lb/>
            For, IN THE EYE OF HEAVEN, a wicked deed <lb n="285"/>
            Devised, is done : What, then, if we proceed ?— <lb/>
            Perpetual fears the offender's peace destroy, <lb/>
            And rob the social hour of all its joy : <lb/>
            Feverish, and parched, he chews, with many a pause, <lb/>
            The tasteless food, that swells beneath his jaws :<lb n="290"/>
            Spits out the produce of the Albanian hill, <lb/>
            Mellowed by age;—you bring him mellower still, <lb/>
            And lo, such wrinkles on his brow appear, <lb/>
            As if you brought Falernian vinegar !</p>
          <p>At night, should sleep his harassed limbs compose, <lb n="295"/>
            And steal him one short moment from his woes, <lb/>
            Then dreams invade ; -sudden, before his eyes <lb/>

            Frowns on the wretch, alarms his treacherous rest, <lb/>

          <p>These, these are they, who tremble and turn pale <lb/>

            Who sink with terror at the transient glare <lb n="305"/>
            Of meteors, glancing through the turbid air! <lb/>
            Oh, 'tis not chance, they cry ; this hideous crash <lb/>
            not the war of winds; nor this dread flash <lb/>
            The encounter of dark clouds ; but blasting fire, <lb/>
            Charged with the wrath of heaven's insulted sire! <lb n="310"/>
            That dreaded peal, innoxious, dies away; <lb/>
            Shuddering, they wait the next with more dismay, <lb/>
            As if the short reprieve were only sent <lb/>
            To add new horrors to their punishment. <lb/>
            Yet more ; when the first symptoms of disease,<lb n="315"/>
            When feverish heats, their restless members seize, <lb/>
            They think the plague by wrath divine bestowed, <lb/>
            And feel, in every pang, the avenging God. <lb/>
            Racked at the thought, in hopeless grief they lie, <lb/>

          <p>With what a rapid change of fancy roll <lb/>
            The varying passions of the guilty soul !- <lb/>
            Bold to offend, they scarce commit the offence, <lb n="325"/>
            Ere the mind labours with an innate sense <lb/>

            When did the flush of modest blood inflame <lb/>
            The cheek, once hardened to the sense of shame ? <lb/>
            Or when the offender, since the birth of time, <lb/>
            Retire, contented with a single crime ?</p>
          <p>And this false friend of ours shall still pursue<lb n="335"/>
            His dangerous course, till vengeance, doubly due, <lb/>

          <p>YES, there are faults, Fuscinus, that disgrace <lb/>
            The noblest qualities of birth and place ; <lb/>
            Which, like infectious blood, transmitted, run, <lb/>
            In one eternal stream, from sire to son.</p>
          <p>If, in destructive play, the senior waste <lb n="5"/>
            His joyous nights, the child, with kindred taste, <lb/>
            Repeats, in miniature, the darling vice, <lb/>
            Shakes the small box, and cogs the little dice.</p>
          <p>Nor does that infant fairer hopes inspire, <lb/>
            Who, trained by the grey epicure, his sire, <lb n="10"/>
            Has learned to pickle mushrooms, and, like him, <lb/>
            To souse the beccaficos, till they swim !— <lb/>
            For take him, thus to early luxury bred, <lb/>
            Ere twice four springs have blossomed o'er his head, <lb/>
            And let ten thousand teachers, hoar with age,<lb n="15"/>
            Inculcate temperance from the stoic page ; <lb/>
            His wish will ever be, in state to dine, <lb/>
            And keep his kitchen's honour from decline !</p>
          <p>Does Rutilus inspire a generous mind, <lb/>
            Prone to forgive, and to slight errors blind ;<lb n="20"/>
            Instil the liberal thought, that slaves have powers, <lb/>
            Sense, feeling, all, as exquisite as ours; <lb/>
            Or fury ? He, who hears the sounding thong <lb/>
            With far more pleasure than the Syren's song; <lb/>
            Who, the stern tyrant of his small domain, <lb n="25"/>
            The Polypheme of his domestic train, <lb/>
            Knows no delight, save when the torturer's hand <lb/>
            Stamps, for low theft, the agonizing brand.- <lb/>
            0, what but rage can fill that stripling's breast, <lb/>
            Who sees his savage sire then only blest, <lb n="30"/>
            When his stretched ears drink in the wretches' cries, <lb/>
            And racks and prisons fill his vengeful eyes !</p>
          <p>And dare we hope, yon girl, from Larga sprung, <lb/>
            Will e'er prove virtuous ; when her little tongue <lb/>
            Ne'er told so fast her mother's wanton train,<lb n="35"/>
            But that she stopt and breathed, and stopt again ? <lb/>
            Even from her tender years, unnatural trust! <lb/>
            The child was privy to the matron's lust :- <lb/>
            Scarce ripe for man, with her own hand, she writes <lb/>
            The billets, which the ancient bawd indites,<lb n="40"/>
            Employs the self-same pimps, and looks, ere long, <lb/>
            To share the visits of the amorous throng!</p>
          <p>So Nature prompts : drawn by her secret tie, <lb/>
            We view a parent's deeds with reverent eye; <pb n="473"/>
            <note type="margin"> SAT. XIV. </note> <lb/>
            With fatal haste, alas! the example take, <lb n="45"/>
            And love the sin, for the dear sinner's sake.- <lb/>
            One youth, perhaps, formed of superior clay, <lb/>
            And warmed, by Titan, with a purer ray, <lb/>
            May dare to slight proximity of blood, <lb/>
            And, in despite of nature, to be good : <lb n="50"/>
            One youth—the rest the beaten pathway tread, <lb/>
            And blindly follow where their fathers led. <lb/>
            O fatal guides! this reason should suffice <lb/>
            To win you from the slippery route of vice, <lb/>
            This powerful reason; lest your sons pursue<lb n="55"/>
            The guilty track, thus plainly marked by you ! <lb/>
            For youth is facile, and its yielding will <lb/>
            Receives, with fatal ease, the imprint of ill : <lb/>
            Hence Catilines in every clime abound ; <lb/>
            But where are Cato and his nephew found! <lb n="60"/>
            </p>
          <p>Swift from the roof where youth, Fuscinus, dwell, <lb/>
            Immodest sights, immodest sounds expel; <lb/>
            THE PLACE IS SACRED : Far, far hence, remove, <lb/>
            Ye venal votaries of illicit love! <lb/>
            Ye dangerous knaves, who pander to be fed, <lb n="65"/>
            And sell yourselves to infamy for bread ! <lb/>
            REVERENCE TO CHILDREN, AS TO HEAVEN, IS DUE : <lb/>
            When you would, then, some darling sin pursue, <lb/>
            Think that your infant offspring eyes the deed; <lb/>
            And let the thought abate your guilty speed, <lb n="70"/>
            Back from the headlong steep your steps entice, <lb/>
            And check you, tottering on the verge of vice. <lb/>
            O yet reflect! for should he e'er provoke, <lb/>
            In riper age, the law's avenging stroke, <lb/>
            (Since not alone in person and in face, <lb n="75"/>

            -Audacious ! with what front do you aspire <lb/>
            To exercise the license of a sire ? <lb/>
            When all, with rising indignation, view <lb/>
            The youth, in turpitude, surpassed by you, <lb/>

            " Let not a spot the clouded columns stain ; <lb/>

            The prying eye of some indifferent friend ? <lb/>
            And do you stir not, that your son may see <lb/>
            The house from moral filth, from vices free !</p>
          <p>True, you have given a citizen to Rome; <lb/>
            And she shall thank you, if the youth become, <lb n="100"/>
            By your o'er-ruling care, or soon or late, <lb/>
            A useful member of the parent state : <lb/>
            For all depends on you ; the stamp he'll take, <lb/>
            From the strong impress which, at first, you make ; <lb/>
            And prove, as vice or virtue was your aim, <lb n="105"/>
            His country's glory, or his country's shame.</p>
          <p>The stork, with snakes and lizards from the wood, <lb/>
            And pathless wild, supports her callow brood ; <lb/>
            And the fledged storklings, when to wing they take, <lb/>
            Seek the same reptiles, through the devious brake. <lb n="110"/>
            The vulture snuffs from far the tainted gale, <lb/>
            And, hurrying where the putrid scents exhale, <lb/>
            From gibbets and from graves the carcass tears, <lb/>
            And to her young the loathsome dainty bears ; <lb/>
            Her young, grown vigorous, hasten from the nest,<lb n="115"/>
            And gorge on carrion with the parent's zest. <lb/>
            While Jove's own eagle, bird of noble blood, <lb/>
            Scours the wide champaign for untainted food, <lb/>
            Bears the swift hare or swifter fawn away, <lb/>
            And feeds her nestlings with the generous prey; <lb n="120"/>
            Her nestlings hence, when from the rock they spring, <lb/>
            And, pinched by hunger, to the quarry wing, <lb/>
            Stoop only to the game they tasted first, <lb/>
            When, clamorous, from the shell, to light they burst.</p>
          <p>Centronius planned and built, and built and planned ; <lb n="125"/>
            And now along Cajeta's winding strand, <lb/>
            And now amid Præneste's hills, and now <lb/>
            On lofty Tibur's solitary brow, <lb/>
            He reared prodigious piles, with marble brought <lb/>
            From distant realms, and exquisitely wrought: <lb n="130"/>
            Prodigious piles! that towered o'er Fortune's shrine, <lb/>
            As those of gelt Posides, Jove, o'er thine ! <lb/>
            While thus Centronius crowded seat on seat, <lb/>
            He spent his cash, and mortgaged his estate; <lb/>
            Yet left enough his family to content: <lb n="135"/>
            Which his mad son, to the last farthing, spent, <lb/>
            While, building on, he strove, with fond desire, <lb/>
            To shame the stately structures of his sire !</p>
          <p>Sprung from a father who the sabbath fears, <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> SAT. XIV. </note> <lb n="140"/>
            And shuns the taste, by old tradition led, <lb/>
            Of human flesh, and swine's, with equal dread :— <lb/>
            This first : the prepuce next he lays aside, <lb/>
            And, taught the Roman ritual to deride, <lb/>
            Clings to the Jewish, and observes with awe <lb n="145"/>
            All Moses bade in his mysterious law : <lb/>
            And, therefore, to the circumcised alone <lb/>
            Will point the road, or make the fountain known ; <lb/>
            Warned by his bigot sire, who whiled away, <lb/>
            Sacred to sloth, each seventh revolving day.<lb n="150"/>
            </p>
          <p>But youth, so prone to follow other ills, <lb/>
            Are driven to AVARICE, against their wills; <lb/>
            For this grave vice, assuming Virtue's guise, <lb/>
            Seems Virtue's self, to undiscerning eyes. <lb/>
            The miser, hence, a frugal man, they name ;<lb n="155"/>
            And hence, they follow, with their whole acclaim, <lb/>
            The griping wretch, who strictlier guards his store, <lb/>
            Than if the Hesperian dragon kept the door.- <lb/>
            Add that the vulgar, stilla slave to gold, <lb/>
            The worthy, in the wealthy, man behold ;<lb n="160"/>
            And, reasoning from the fortune be has made, <lb/>
            Hail him, A perfect master of his trade ! <lb/>
            And true, indeed, it is-such MASTERS raise <lb/>
            Immense estates ; no matter, by what ways ; <lb/>
            But raise they do, with brows in sweat still dyed, <lb n="165"/>
            With forge still glowing, and with sledge still plied. <lb/>
            The father, by the love of wealth possest, <lb/>
            Convinced-the covetous alone are blest, <lb/>
            And that, nor past, nor present times, e'er knew <lb/>
            A poor man happy,-bids his son pursue <lb n="170"/>
            The paths they take, the courses they affect, <lb/>
            And follow, at the heels, this thriving sect.</p>
          <p>Vice boasts its elements, like other arts; <lb/>
            These, he inculcates first: anon, imparts <lb/>
            The petty tricks of saving; last, inspires, <lb n="175"/>
            Of endless wealth, the insatiable desires.- <lb/>
            Hungry himself, his hungry slaves he cheats, <lb/>
            With scanty measures, and unfaithful weights ; <lb/>
            And sees them lessen, with increasing dread, <lb/>
            The flinty fragments of his vinewed bread.<lb n="180"/>
            In dog-days, when the sun, with fervent power, <lb/>
            Corrupts the freshest meat from hour to hour, <lb/>
            He saves the last night's hash, sets by a dish <lb/>
            Of sodden beans, and scraps of summer fish, <lb/>
            And half a stinking shad, and a few strings <lb n="185"/>
            Of a chopped leek—all told, like sacred things, <lb/>
            And sealed with caution, though the sight and smell <lb/>

          <p><note type="margin"> SAT. XIV. </note> But why this dire avidity of gain ? <lb/>
            This mass collected with such toil and pain ?<lb n="190"/>
            Since 'tis the veriest madness, to live poor, <lb/>
            And die with bags and coffers running o'er. <lb/>
            Besides, while thus the streams of affluence roll, <lb/>
            They nurse the eternal dropsy of the soul, <lb/>
            For thirst of wealth still grows with wealth increast,<lb n="195"/>
            And they desire it less, who have it least.-</p>
          <p>Now swell his wants : one manor is too small, <lb/>
            Another must be bought, house, lands, and all; <lb/>
            Still " cribbed confined," he spurns the narrow bounds, <lb/>
            And turns an eye on every neighbour's grounds : <lb n="200"/>
            There all allures; his crops appear a foil <lb/>
            To the rich produce of their happier soil. <lb/>
            " And this, I'll purchase, with the grove," he cries, <lb/>
            " And that fair hill, where the grey olives rise." <lb/>
            Then, if the owner to no price will yield, <lb n="205"/>
            (Resolved to keep the hereditary field,) <lb/>
            Whole droves of oxen, starved to this intent, <lb/>
            Among his springing corn, by night, are sent, <lb/>
            To revel there, till not a blade be seen, <lb/>
            And all appear like a close-shaven green.<lb n="210"/>
            " Monstrous ! " you say-And yet, 'twere hard to tell, <lb/>
            What numbers, tricks like these have forced to sell.</p>
          <p>But, sure, the general voice has marked his name, <lb/>
            And given him up to infamy and shame :— <lb/>
            " And what of that ? " he cries. " I valued more <lb n="215"/>
            A single lupine, added to my store, <lb/>
            Than all the country's praise; if cursed by fate <lb/>

            'Tis well! no more shall age or grief annoy, <lb/>

            The meed of toil and blood! yet never thought <lb/>
            His country thankless, or his pains ill bought. <lb/>

            Three free-born, one a slave : while, on the board, <lb/>
            Huge porringers, with wholesome pottage stored, <lb/>

            And this he silences, and that defies, <lb/>
            Fear, Shame,—he bears down all, and, with loose rein, <lb n="245"/>

            </p>
          <p>Thus, to their children, spoke the sires of yore. <lb/>
            Now, autumn's sickly heats are scarcely o'er, <lb/>
            Ere, while deep midnight yet involves the skies, <lb/>
            The impatient father shakes his son, and cries, <lb/>
            " What, bo, boy, wake ! Up ; pleas, rejoinders draw,<lb n="265"/>
            Turn o'er the rubric of our ancient law; <lb/>
            Up, up, and study : or, with brief in hand, <lb/>
            Petition Lælius for a small command, <lb/>
            A captain's!—Lælius loves a spreading chest, <lb/>
            Broad shoulders, tangled locks, and hairy breast.<lb n="270"/>
            The British towers, the Moorish tents destroy, <lb/>
            And the rich Eagle, at threescore, enjoy !</p>
          <p>" But if the trump, prelusive to the fight, <lb/>
            And the long labours of the camp affright, <lb/>
            Go, look for merchandise of readiest vent,<lb n="275"/>
            Which yields a sure return of cent. per cent. <lb/>
            Buy this, no matter what; the ware is good, <lb/>
            Though not allowed on this side Tiber's flood : <lb/>
            Hides, unguents, mark me, boy, are equal things, <lb/>
            And gain smells sweet, from whatsoe'er it springs. <lb n="280"/>
            This golden sentence, which the Powers of heaven, <lb/>
            Which Jove himself, might glory to have given, <lb/>
            Will never, never, from your thoughts, I trust,- <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> SAT. XIV. </note> <lb/>
            This, when the lisping race a farthing ask,<lb n="285"/>
            Old women set them, as a previous task ; <lb/>
            The wondrous apophthegm all run to get, <lb/>
            And learn it sooner than their alphabet.</p>
          <p>But why this haste ? Without your care, vain fool! <lb/>
            The pupil will, ere long, the tutor school: <lb n="290"/>
            Sleep, then, in peace; secure to be outdone, <lb/>
            Like Telamon, or Peleus, by your son. <lb/>
            0, yet indulge awhile his tender years : <lb/>
            The seeds of vice, sown by your fostering cares, <lb/>
            Have scarce ta'en root; but they will spring at length,<lb n="295"/>
            " Grow with his growth, and strengthen with his strength." <lb/>
            Then, when the firstlings of his youth are paid, <lb/>
            And his rough chin requires the razor's aid, <lb/>
            Then he will swear, then to the altar come, <lb/>
            And sell deep perjuries for a paltry sum !— <lb n="300"/>
            Believe your step-daughter already dead, <lb/>
            If, with an ample dower, she mount his bed : <lb/>
            Lo ! scarcely laid, his murderous fingers creep, <lb/>
            And close her eyes in everlasting sleep. <lb/>
            For that vast wealth which, with long years of pain, <lb n="305"/>
            You thought would be acquired by land and main, <lb/>
            He gets a readier way : the skill's not great, <lb/>
            The toil not much, to make a knave complete.</p>
          <p>But you will say hereafter, " I am free: <lb/>
            He never learned those practices of me." <lb n="310"/>
            Yes, all of you :-for he who, madly blind, <lb/>
            Imbues with avarice his children's mind, <lb/>
            Fires with the thirst of riches, and applauds <lb/>
            The attempt, to double their estate by frauds, <lb/>
            Unconscious, flings the headlong wheels the rein, <lb n="315"/>
            Which he may wish to stop, but wish in vain ; <lb/>
            Deaf to his voice, with growing speed they roll, <lb/>
            Smoke down the steep, and spurn the distant goal!</p>
          <p>None sin by rule ; none heed the charge precise, <lb/>
            THUS, AND NO FURTHER, MAY YE STEP IN VICE ; <lb n="320"/>
            But leap the bounds prescribed, and, with free pace, <lb/>
            Scour far and wide the interdicted space. <lb/>
            So, when you tell the youth, that FOOLS alone <lb/>
            Regard a friend's distresses as their own; <lb/>
            You bid the willing hearer riches raise, <lb n="325"/>
            By fraud, by rapine, by the worst of ways ; <lb/>
            Riches, whose love is on your soul imprest, <lb/>
            Deep as their country's on the Decii's breast; <lb/>
            Or Thebes on his, who sought an early grave, <lb/>
            (If Greece say true,) her sacred walls to save. <lb n="330"/>
            Thebes, where, impregned with serpents' teeth, the earth <lb/>

            From a small sparkle, by your folly nurst, <lb/>
            Blown to a flame, on all around it preys, <lb/>
            And wraps you in the universal blaze. <lb/>
            So the young lion rent, with hideous roar, <lb/>
            His keeper's trembling limbs, and drank his gore. <lb n="340"/>

          <p>" Tush! I am safe," you cry; " Chaldæan seers <lb/>
            Have raised my Scheme, and promised length of years." <lb/>
            But has your son subscribed ? will he await <lb/>
            The lingering distaff of decrepit Fate ? <lb/>
            No ;—his impatience will the work confound, <lb n="345"/>
            And snap the vital thread, ere half unwound. <lb/>
            Even now your long and stag-like age annoys <lb/>
            His future hopes, and palls his present joys. <lb/>

            An antidote, if life be worth your care ; <lb n="350"/>
            If you would see another autumn close, <lb/>
            And pluck another fig, another rose :— <lb/>
            Take mithridate, rash man, before your meat, <lb/>
            A FATHER, you ? and without medicine eat!</p>
          <p>Come, my Fuscinus, come with me, and view <lb n="355"/>
            A scene more comic than the stage e'er knew. <lb/>
            Lo! with what toil, what danger, wealth is sought, <lb/>
            And to the fane of watchful Castor brought; <lb/>
            Since MARS THE AVENGER slumbered, to his cost, <lb/>
            And, with his helmet, all his credit lost ! <lb n="360"/>
            Quit then the plays! the FARCE OF LIFE supplies <lb/>
            A scene more comic in the sage's eyes. <lb/>
            For who amuses most ?-the man who springs, <lb/>
            Light, through the hoop, and on the tight-rope swings ; <lb/>
            Or he, who, to a fragile bark confined,<lb n="365"/>
            Dwells on the deep, the sport of wave and wind ? <lb/>
            Fool-hardy wretch ! scrambling for every bale <lb/>
            Of stinking merchandise, exposed to sale ; <lb/>
            And proud to Crete, for ropy wine, to rove, <lb/>
            And jars, the fellow citizens of Jove! <lb n="370"/>
            THAT skips along the rope, with wavering tread, <lb/>
            Dangerous dexterity, which brings him bread; <lb/>
            THIS ventures life, for wealth too vast to spend, <lb/>
            Farm joined to farm, and villas without end !</p>
          <p>Lo, every harbour thronged and every bay,<lb n="375"/>
            And half mankind upon the watery way! <lb/>
            For, where he bears the attractive voice of gain, <lb/>
            The merchant hurries, and defies the main.- <lb/>
            Nor will he only range the Libyan shore, <lb/>
            But, passing Calpé, other worlds explore : <pb n="480"/>
            <note type="margin"> SAT. XIV. </note> <lb n="380"/>
            See Phœbus, sinking in the Atlantic, lave <lb/>

            And all for what ? 0 glorious end! to come, <lb/>
            His toils o'erpast, with purse replenished, home, <lb/>
            And, with a traveller's privilege, vent his boasts, <lb n="385"/>
            Of unknown monsters seen on unknown coasts.</p>
          <p>What varying forms in madness may we trace !— <lb/>
            Safe in his loved Electra's fond embrace, <lb/>
            Orestes sees the avenging Furies rise, <lb/>
            And flash their bloody torches in his eyes ;<lb n="390"/>
            While Ajax strikes an ox. and, at the blow, <lb/>
            Hears Agamemnon or Ulysses low : <lb/>
            And surely he (though, haply, he forbear, <lb/>
            Like these, his keeper and his clothes to tear) <lb/>
            just as mad, who to the water's brim<lb n="395"/>
            Loads his frail bark-a plank 'twixt death and him! <lb/>
            When all this risk is but to swell his store <lb/>
            With a few coins, a few gold pieces more.</p>
          <p>Heaven lours, and frequent, through the muttering air, <lb/>
            The nimble lightning glares, or seems to glare : <lb n="400"/>
            " Weigh! weigh ! " the impatient man of traffic cries, <lb/>
            " These gathering clouds, this rack that dims the skies, <lb/>
            Are but the pageants of a sultry day; <lb/>
            A thunder shower, that frowns, and melts away." <lb/>
            Deluded wretch ! dashed on some dangerous coast, <lb n="405"/>
            This night, this hour, perhaps, his bark is lost; <lb/>
            While he still strives, though whelmed beneath the wave, <lb/>
            His darling purse with teeth or hand to save. <lb/>
            Thus he, who sighed, of late, for all the gold <lb/>
            Down the bright Tagus and Pactolus rolled, <lb n="410"/>
            Now bounds his wishes to one poor request, <lb/>
            A scanty morsel and a tattered vest; <lb/>
            And shows, where tears, where supplications fail, <lb/>
            A daubing of his melancholy tale !</p>
          <p>Wealth, by such dangers earned, such anxious pain, <lb n="415"/>
            Requires more care to keep it, than to gain: <lb/>
            Whate'er my miseries, make me not, kind Fate, <lb/>
            The sleepless Argus of a vast estate! <lb/>
            The slaves of Licinus, a numerous band, <lb/>
            Watch through the night, with buckets in their hand, <lb n="420"/>
            While their rich master trembling lies, afraid <lb/>
            Lest fire his ivory, amber, gold, invade. <lb/>
            The naked Cynic mocks such restless cares, <lb/>
            His earthen tub no conflagration fears; <lb/>
            If cracked, to-morrow he procures a new,<lb n="425"/>
            Or, coarsely soldering, makes the old one do. <lb/>
            Even Philip's son, when, in his little cell <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> SAT. XV. </note> <lb/>
            Owned, with a sigh, that he, who nought desired, <lb/>
            Was happier far, than he who worlds required, <lb n="430"/>
            And whose ambition certain dangers brought, <lb/>
            Vast, and unbounded, as the object sought.- <lb/>
            Fortune, advanced to heaven by fools alone, <lb/>
            Would lose, were wisdom ours, her shadowy throne.</p>
          <p>" What call I, then, ENOUGH ? " What will afford <lb n="435"/>
            A decent habit, and a frugal board ; <lb/>
            What Epicurus' little garden bore, <lb/>
            And Socrates sufficient thought, before : <lb/>
            These squared by Nature's rules their blameless life- <lb/>
            Nature and Wisdom never are at strife. <lb n="440"/>
            </p>
          <p>You think, perhaps, these rigid means too scant, <lb/>
            And that I ground philosophy on want; <lb/>
            Take then, (for I will be indulgent now, <lb/>
            And something for the change of times allow,) <lb/>
            As much as Otho for a knight requires :— <lb n="445"/>
            If this, unequal to your wild desires, <lb/>
            Contract your brow ; enlarge the sum, and take <lb/>
            As much as two,-as much as three-will make. <lb/>
            If yet, in spite of this prodigious store, <lb/>

            Who swayed the Emperor, and whose fatal word <lb n="455"/>

            Hands, where the gore of mangled eyes yet reeks, <lb/>
            And jaw-bones starting through the cloven cheeks!</p>
          <p>But this is sport, mere children's play, they cry— <lb/>
            As yet beneath their feet no bodies lie, <lb/>
            And, to what purpose should such armies fight <lb n="85"/>
            The cause of heaven, if none be slain outright ? <lb/>
            Roused at the thought, more fiercely they engage, <lb/>
            With stones, the weapons of intestine rage ; <lb/>
            Yet not precisely such, to tell you true, <lb/>
            As Turnus erst, or mightier Ajax, threw: <lb n="90"/>
            Nor quite so large as that two-banded stone, <lb/>
            Which bruised Æneas on the huckle-bone ; <lb/>
            But such as men, in our degenerate days, <lb/>
            Ah, how unlike to theirs! make shift to raise. <lb/>
            Even in his time, Mæonides could trace <lb n="95"/>
            Some diminution of the human race : <lb/>
            Now, earth, grown old and frigid, rears with pain <lb/>
            A pigmy brood, a weak and wicked train ; <lb/>
            Which every god, who marks their passions vile, <lb/>
            Regards with laughter, though he loathes the while. <lb n="100"/>
            </p>
          <p>But to our tale. Enforced with armed supplies, <lb/>
            The zealous Tent'rites feel their courage rise, <lb/>
            And wave their swords, and, kindling at the sight, <lb/>
            Press on, and with fell rage renew the fight. <lb/>
            The Ombites flee ; they follow :-in the rear, <lb n="105"/>
            A luckless wretch, confounded by his fear, <lb/>
            Trips and falls headlong ; with loud yelling cries, <lb/>
            The pack rush in, and seize him as he lies.</p>
          <p>And now the conquerors, none to disappoint <lb/>
            Of the dire banquet, tear him joint by joint, <lb n="110"/>
            And dole him round; the bones yet warm, they gnaw, <lb/>
            And champ the flesh that heaves beneath their jaw. <lb/>
            They want no cook to dress it—'twould be long, <lb/>
            And appetite is keen, and rage is strong. <lb/>
            And here, Volusius, I rejoice at least, <lb n="115"/>
            That fire was unprofaned by this cursed feast, <lb/>
            Fire, rapt from heaven! and you will, sure, agree <lb/>
            To greet the element's escape, with me. <note type="footnote"> 2 I 2 </note> <pb n="484"/>

            -But all who ventured on the carcass, swore <lb/>
            They never tasted-aught so sweet before ! <lb n="120"/>
            Nor did the relish charm the first alone- <lb/>
            Those who arrived too late for flesh, or bone, <lb/>
            Stooped down, and scraping where the wretch had lain, <lb/>
            With savage pleasure licked the gory plain!</p>
          <p>The Vascons once, (the story yet is rife,) <lb n="125"/>
            With such dire sustenance prolonged their life ; <lb/>
            t then the cause was different: Fortune, there, <lb/>
            Proved adverse : they had borne the extremes of war, <lb/>
            The rage of famine, the still-watchful foe, <lb/>
            And all the ills beleaguered cities know.<lb n="130"/>
            (And nothing less should prompt mankind to use <lb/>
            Such desperate means.) May this their crime excuse ! <lb/>
            For after every root and herb were gone, <lb/>
            And every aliment to hunger known ; <lb/>
            When their lean frames, and cheeks of sallow hue, <lb n="135"/>
            Struck even the foe with pity at the view, <lb/>
            And all were ready their own flesh to tear, <lb/>
            They first adventured on this horrid fare. <lb/>
            And surely every god would pity grant <lb/>
            To men so worn by wretchedness and want, <lb n="140"/>
            And even the very ghosts of those they ate, <lb/>
            Absolve them, mindful of their dreadful state!</p>
          <p>True, we are wiser; and, by Zeno taught, J <lb/>
            Know life itself may be too dearly bought; <lb/>
            But the poor Vascon, in that early age, <lb n="145"/>
            Knew nought of Zeno, or the Stoic page.- <lb/>
            Now, thanks to Greece and Rome, in wisdom's robe <lb/>
            The bearded tribes rush forth, and seize the globe : <lb/>
            Already, learned Gaul aspires to teach <lb/>
            Your British orators the Art of Speech ; <lb n="150"/>
            And Thule, blessings on her ! seems to say, <lb/>
            She'll hire a good grammarian, cost what may.</p>
          <p>The Vascons, then, who thus prolonged their breath, <lb/>
            And the Saguntines, true, like them, to death, <lb/>
            Brave too, like them, but by worse ills subdued, <lb n="155"/>
            Had some small plea for this abhorred food.</p>
          <p>Diana first, (and let us doubt no more <lb/>
            The barbarous rites we disbelieved of yore,) <lb/>
            Reared her dread altar near the Tauric flood, <lb/>
            And asked the sacrifice of human blood : <lb n="160"/>
            Yet there the victim only lost his life, <lb/>
            And feared no cruelty beyond the knife. <lb/>
            Far, far more savage Egypt's frantic train, <lb/>
            They butcher first, and then devour the slain ! <lb/>
            But say, what cause impelled them to proceed, <lb n="165"/>
            What siege, what famine, to this monstrous deed ? <lb/>
            What could they more, had Nile refused to rise, <lb/>
            And the soil gaped with ever-glowing skies, <pb n="485"/>
            <note type="margin"> SAT. XV. </note> <lb/>
            What could they more, the guilty Flood to shame, <lb/>
            And heap opprobrium on his hateful name ! <lb n="170"/>
            </p>
          <p>Lo ! what the barbarous hordes of Scythia, Thrace, <lb/>
            Gaul, Britain, never dared-dared by a race <lb/>
            Of puny dastards, who, with fingers frail, <lb/>
            Tui, the light oar, and hoist the little sail, <lb/>
            In painted pans! What tortures can the mind <lb n="175"/>
            Suggest for miscreants of this abject kind, <lb/>
            Whom spite impelled worse horrors to pursue, <lb/>
            Than famine, in its deadliest form, e'er knew !</p>
          <p>NATURE, who gave us tears, by that alone <lb/>
            Proclaims she made the feeling heart our own ; <lb n="180"/>
            And 'tis her noblest boon : This bids us fly, <lb/>
            To wipe the drops from sorrowing friendship's eye, <lb/>
            Sorrowing ourselves ; to wail the prisoner's state, <lb/>
            And sympathize in the wronged orphan's fate, <lb/>
            Compelled his treacherous guardian to accuse, <lb n="185"/>
            While many a shower his blooming cheek bedews, <lb/>
            And through his scattered tresses, wet with tears, <lb/>
            A doubtful face, or boy or girl's, appears. <lb/>
            As Nature bids, we sigh, when some bright maid <lb/>
            Is, ere her spousals, to the pyre conveyed ; <lb n="190"/>
            Some babe-by fate's inexorable doom, <lb/>
            Just shown on earth, and hurried to the tomb.</p>
          <p>For who, that to the sanctity aspires <lb/>
            Which Ceres, for her mystic torch, requires, <lb/>
            Feels not another's woes ? This marks our birth ; <lb n="195"/>
            The great distinction from the beasts of earth ! <lb/>
            And therefore,—gifted with superior powers, <lb/>
            And capable of things divine,—'tis ours, <lb/>
            To learn, and practise, every useful art; <lb/>
            And, from high heaven, deduce that better part, <lb n="200"/>
            That moral sense, denied to creatures prone, <lb/>
            And downward bent, and found with man alone! — <lb/>
            For He, who gave this vast machine to roll, <lb/>
            Breathed LIFE in them, in us a REASONING SOUL; <lb/>
            That kindred feelings might our state improve, <lb n="205"/>
            And mutual wants conduct to mutual love; <lb/>
            Woo to one spot the scattered hordes of men, <lb/>
            From their old forest and paternal den ; <lb/>
            Raise the fair dome, extend the social line, <lb/>
            And, to our mansion, those of others join, <lb n="210"/>
            Join too our faith, our confidence to theirs, <lb/>
            And sleep, relying on the general cares :— <lb/>
            In war, that each to each support might lend, <lb/>
            When wounded, succour, and when fallen, defend ; <lb/>
            At the same trumpet's clangour rush to arms, <lb n="215"/>
            By the same walls be sheltered from alarms, <lb/>
            Near the same tower the foe's incursions wait, <lb/>
            And trust their safety to one common gate. <pb n="486"/>

            -But serpents, now, more links of concord bind : <lb/>
            The cruel leopard spares the spotted kind ; <lb n="220"/>
            No lion spills a weaker lion's gore, <lb/>
            No boar expires beneath a stronger boar; <lb/>
            In leagues of friendship, tigers roam the plain, <lb/>
            And bears with bears perpetual peace maintain. <lb/>
            While man, alas ! fleshed in the dreadful trade, <lb n="225"/>
            Forges without remorse the murderous blade, <lb/>
            On that dire anvil, where primæval skill, <lb/>

            Wrought only what meek nature would allow, <lb/>
            Goads for the ox, and coulters for the plough ! <lb n="230"/>
            </p>
          <p>Even this is trifling : we have seen a rage <lb/>
            Too fierce for murder only to assuage ; <lb/>
            Seen a whole state their victim piecemeal tear, <lb/>

            Dear Callus, on the Military State ?— <lb/>
            For let me once, beneath a lucky star, <lb/>
            Faint as I am of heart, and new to war, <lb/>
            But join the camp, and that ascendant hour <lb n="5"/>
            Shall lord it o'er my fate with happier power, <lb/>
            Than if a line from Venus should commend <lb/>
            My suit to Mars, or Juno stand my friend !</p>
          <p>And first, of benefits which all may share : <lb/>
            'Tis somewhat-that no citizen shall dare<lb n="10"/>
            To strike you, or, though struck, return the blow : <lb/>
            But wave the wrong ; nor to the Prætor show <lb/>
            His teeth dashed out, his face deformed with gore, <lb/>
            And eyes no skill can promise to restore !</p>
          <p>A Judge, if to the camp your plaints you bear, <lb n="15"/>
            Coarse shod, and coarser greaved, awaits you there : <lb/>
            By antique law proceeds the cassocked sage, <lb/>
            And rules prescribed in old Camillus' age ; <lb/>
            To Mit, Let soldiers seek no foreign bench. <lb/>
            Nor plead to any charge without the french. <lb n="20"/>

            And ample, if with reason we complain, <lb/>
            Is, doubtless, the redress our injuries gain ! <lb/>
            Even so :-but the whole legion are our foes, <lb n="25"/>
            And, with determined aim, the award oppose. <pb n="487"/>

            " These snivelling rogues take special pleasure still <lb/>
            To make the punishment outweigh the ill." <lb/>
            So runs the cry ; and he must be possest <lb/>
            Of more, Vagellius, than thy iron breast, <lb n="30"/>
            Who braves their anger, and, with ten poor toes, <lb/>

            Nor ask that kindness, which must be denied. <lb/>
            For, when the Court exclaims, " Your witness, here! " <lb/>
            Let that firm friend, that man of men, appear, <lb/>
            And testify but what he saw and heard; <lb/>
            And I pronounce him worthy of the beard<lb n="40"/>
            And hair of our forefathers! You may find <lb/>
            False witnesses against an honest hind, <lb/>
            Easier than true, (and who their fears can blame ?) <lb/>
            Against a soldier's purse, a soldier's fame!</p>
          <p>But there are other benefits, my friend,<lb n="45"/>
            And greater, which the sons of war attend: <lb/>
            Should a litigious neighbour bid me yield <lb/>
            My vale irriguous, and paternal field ; <lb/>
            Or from my bounds the sacred landmark tear, <lb/>
            To which, with each revolving spring, I bear,<lb n="50"/>
            In pious duty to the grateful soil, <lb/>
            My humble offerings, honey, meal, and oil; <lb/>
            Or a vile debtor my just claims withstand, <lb/>
            Deny his signet, and abjure his hand ; <lb/>
            Term after Term I wait, till months be past, <lb n="55"/>
            And scarce obtain a hearing at the last. <lb/>
            Even when the hour is fixed, a thousand stays <lb/>
            Retard my suit, a thousand vague delays : <lb/>
            The cause is called, the witnesses attend, <lb/>
            Chairs brought, and cushions laid-and there an end!<lb n="60"/>
            Cæditius finds his cloak or gown too hot, <lb/>
            And Fuscus slips aside to seek the pot; <lb/>
            Thus, with our dearest hopes the judges sport, <lb/>
            And when we rise to speak, dismiss the Court! <lb/>
            But spear-and-shield-men may command the hour; <lb n="65"/>
            The time to plead is always in their power ; <lb/>
            Nor are their wealth and patience worn away, <lb/>
            By the slow drag-chain of the law's delay.</p>
          <p>Add that the soldier, while his father lives, <lb/>
            And he alone, his wealth bequeaths or gives ; <lb n="70"/>
            For what by pay is earned, by plunder won, <lb/>
            The law declares, vests solely in the son. <lb/>
            Coranus therefore sees his hoary sire, <lb/>
            To gain his Will, by every art, aspire!- <lb/>
            HE rose by service ; rank in fields obtained, <lb n="75"/>
            And well deserved the fortune which he gained. <pb n="488"/>
            <note type="margin"> SAT. I. </note> <lb/>
            And every prudent chief must, sure, desire, <lb/>

            What are thy thoughts of Jove ? My thoughts ! Yes; thine. <lb/>
            Wouldst thou prefer him to the herd of Rome ? <lb/>
            To any individual ?-But, to whom ? <lb/>
            To Staius, for example. Heavens ! a pause ? <lb n="35"/>
            Which of the two would best dispense the laws ? <lb/>
            Best shield the unfriended orphan ? Good! Now move <lb/>
            The suit to Staius, late preferred to Jove :— <lb/>
            " 0 Jove! good Jove ! " he cries, o'erwhelmed with shame, <lb/>
            And must not Jove himself, 0 Jove! exclaim ?<lb n="40"/>
            </p>
          <p>Or dost thou think the impious wish forgiven, <lb/>
            Because, when thunder shakes the vault of heaven, <lb/>
            The bolt innoxious flies o'er thee and thine. <lb/>
            To rend the forest oak and mountain pine ? <lb/>

            Her starveling Hope ; and breathes a humble prayer,<lb n="60"/>
            That heaven would only tender to his hands <lb/>
            All Crassus' houses, all Licinius' lands !— <lb/>
            " Let every gazer by his charms be won, <lb/>
            And kings and queens aspire to call him son : <lb/>
            Contending virgins fly his smiles to meet, <lb n="65"/>
            And roses spring where'er he sets his feet! "</p>
          <p>Insane of soul-But I, 0 Jove, am free. <lb/>

            Day after day the willing gods withstand, <lb n="75"/>
            And dash the blessing from their opening hand.</p>
          <p>That sues for wealth : the labouring ox is slain, <lb/>

            Steer after steer in offerings melts away ?— <lb/>
            Still he persists; and still new hopes arise, <lb/>
            With harslet and with tripe, to storm the skies. <lb/>

          <p>If from my side-board I should bid you take <lb/>
            Goblets of gold or silver, you would shake <lb/>
            With eager rapture ; drops of joy would start, <lb/>

            And from her altars the cold ashes shakes.- <lb n="90"/>
            Lo ! from the imperial spoils, Cæsonia brings <lb/>
            Arms, and the martial robes of conquered kings, <lb/>
            To deck the temples ; while, on either hand, <lb/>
            Chariots of war and bulky captives stand <lb/>
            In long array. I, too, my joy to prove,<lb n="95"/>
            Will to the emperor's Genius, and to Jove, <lb/>
            Devote, in gratitude for deeds so rare, <lb/>
            Two hundred well-matched fencers, pair by pair. <lb/>
            Who blames-who ventures to forbid me? You ? <lb/>
            Woe to your future prospects ! if you do. <lb n="100"/>
            -And, sir, not this alone; for I have vowed <lb/>
            A supplemental largess to the crowd, <lb/>
            Of corn and oil. What! muttering still ? draw near, <lb/>
            And speak aloud, for once, that I may hear. <lb/>
            " My means are not so low that I should care <lb n="105"/>
            For that poor pittance you may leave your heir."</p>
          <p>Just as you please : but were I, sir, bereft <lb/>
            Of all my kin ; no aunt, no uncle left; <pb n="512"/>
            <note type="margin"> SAT. VI. </note> <lb/>
            No nephew, niece ; were all my cousins gone, <lb/>
            And all my cousins' cousins, every one,<lb n="110"/>
            Aricia soon some Manius would supply, <lb/>
            Well pleased to take that “pittance," when I die.</p>
          <p>" Manius ! a beggar of the first degree, <lb/>
            A son of earth, your heir ! " Nay, question me, <lb/>
            Ask who my grandsire's sire ? I know not well, <lb n="115"/>
            And yet, on recollection, I might tell; <lb/>
            But urge me one step further—I am mute : <lb/>
            A son of earth, like Manius, past dispute. <lb/>
            Thus his descent and mine are equal proved, <lb/>
            Aud we at last are cousins, though removed. <lb n="120"/>
            </p>
          <p>But why should you, who still before me run, <lb/>
            Require my torch ere yet the race be won ?</p>
          <p>Think me your Mercury : Lo ! here I stand, <lb/>
            As painters represent him, purse in hand': <lb/>
            Will you, or not, the proffered boon receive, <lb n="125"/>
            And take, with thankfulness, whate'er I leave ?</p>
          <p>Something, you murmur, of the heap is spent. <lb/>
            True : as occasion called it freely went; <lb/>
            In life 'twas mine : but death your chance secures, <lb/>
            And what remains, or more or less, is yours. <lb n="130"/>
            Of Tadius' legacy no questions raise, <lb/>
            Nor turn upon me with a grandsire-phrase, <lb/>
            " Live on the interest of your fortune, boy ; <lb/>
            To touch the principal is to destroy."</p>
          <p>" What, after all, may I expect to have ? " <lb n="135"/>
            Expect!—Pour oil upon my viands, slave, <lb/>
            Pour with unsparing hand! shall my best cheer <lb/>
            On high and solemn days be the singed ear <lb/>
            Of some tough, smoke-dried hog, with nettles drest; <lb/>
            That your descendant, while in earth I rest, <lb n="140"/>
            May gorge on dainties, and, when lust excites, <lb/>
            Give to patrician beds his wasteful nights ?</p>
          <p>Shall I, a napless figure, pale and thin, <lb/>
            Glide by, transparent, in a parchment skin, <lb/>
            That he may strut with more than priestly pride, <lb n="115"/>
            And swag his portly paunch from side to side ?</p>
          <p>Go, truck your soul for gain ! buy, sell, exchange ; <lb/>
            From pole to pole in quest of profit range. <lb/>
            Let none more shrewdly play the factor's part; <lb/>
            None bring his slaves more timely to the mart ; <lb n="150"/>
            Puff them with happier skill, as caged they stand, <lb/>
            Or clap their well-fed sides with nicer hand.</p>
          <p>Double your fortune-treble it-yet more­ <lb/>
            'Tis four, six, ten-fold what it was before : <lb/>
            O bound the heap—You, who could yours confine, <lb n="155"/>
            Tell me, Chrysippus, how to limit mine!</p>
          <p>JOHN CHILDS AND SON, BUNGAY.</p>
