            <title type="sub">CHAP. I.—Of the Argument of this Treatise: of Syllogism and its kinds.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THE purpose of this treatise is to discover a <lb/>
            method by which we shall be able to syllogize <lb/>
            about every proposed problem from probabilities, <lb/>
            1. The design <lb/>
            of this treatise <lb/>
            set forth. <note type="footnote"> 1 It will contribute to the general elucidation of this treatise, if we re­ <lb/>
            mark, first, upon its scope and purpose, and secondly, upon the import <lb/>
            of its title. </note><note type="footnote"> As to the first, then, Aristotle here discusses the probable or dialectic <lb/>
            syllogism, in order that he who disputes (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὸδιαλεγων</foreign>) may be able to <lb/>
            syllogize concerning any problem upon each part, and to defend each, <lb/>
            not from tine, but probable assertions only, which are the appropriate <lb/>
            province of this art. In a general sense indeed, <foreign xml:lang="grc">διαλεϰτιϰὴ</foreign> is not quite <lb/>
            synonymous with what we understand by logic, but was rather the faculty <lb/>
            of conversational disputation, of which logic was a species, and this is <lb/>
            proved by the subject matter of each; that of logic being the uniform <lb/>
            and absolute that of dialectic being the merely probable syllogism. Still, <lb/>
            though the term dialectic was greatly modified by previous philosophers, <lb/>
            its meaning was limited by Aristotle, who enumerates four kinds of rea­ <lb/>
            soning, conveyed under the colloquial form, viz. <foreign xml:lang="grc">λόγοι διδασϰαλιϰοί, δια­ <lb/>
            λεϰτιϰοί, πειραστιϰοί</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">έριστιϰοί</foreign>: upon the distinction between these, <lb/>
            and upon the Aristotelian dialectic and its diversity from that of Plato, <lb/>
            the reader is referred to Mansel's Introduction, Whately's Logic, and <lb/>
            Ritter, vol. ii. It is merely necessary for our present purpose, to state <lb/>
            that, with Aristotle, dialectic constituted " the art of disputing by question <lb/>
            and answer, of attacking and defending a given thesis from principles of <lb/>
            mere probability, such as the opinions of men in general, or of the ma­ <lb/>
            jority, or of certain eminent authorities, and for this purpose, he col­ <lb/>
            lected <foreign xml:lang="grc">τόποι</foreign>, or general principles of probability, from which the pre­ <lb/>
            mises of the disputants were to be drawn." As Mansel observes, " Each <lb/>
            asked his opponent to grant certain premises, which ought primâ facie to <lb/>
            be sufficiently probable to gain the assent of the other: these being <lb/>
            granted, he endeavoured to deduce from them his own conclusion, or to <lb/>
            involve his antagonist in contradictions resulting from such concession. <lb/>
            For the constitution of the probable syllogism itself, the reader can pro­ <lb/>
            fitably consult Crakanthorpe, or that portion extracted from lib. v. of his <lb/>
            work, appended to Dr. Hessey's Schema Rhetorica. Cf. also Rhetoric, <lb/>
            b. ii. ch. 25. </note><note type="footnote"> Concerning the position the consideration of dialectic occupies here, </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 A 3 </note> <lb/>
            <pb n="358"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[Book I."/><lb/>
            and when we ourselves sustain the argument we may assert <lb/>
            nothing repugnant. First, then, we must declare what a syl­ <note type="footnote">we may notice, that of the three parts of logic, the first, which treats <lb/>
            of objects of simple apprehension, is contained in the Categories, also <lb/>
            in the Introduction by Porphyry; the second part, upon the objects of <lb/>
            enunciation, in the treatise on Interpretation; and the third, which con­ <lb/>
            siders the objects of syllogism, in the remaining treatises of Aristotle. This <lb/>
            third part however is subdivided into four others; the 1st, which discusses <lb/>
            syllogism in general, in the books of the Prior Analytics; the 2nd, of <lb/>
            demonstrative syllogism, in the Posterior Analytics; the 3rd, of probable <lb/>
            syllogism, in the Topics; and the 4th, of sophistical syllogism, in the <lb/>
            Sophistical Elenchi: Aristotle draws however a distinction between the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὲριστιϰός</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">σοφιστιϰός</foreign>, the former employing fallacy for a display of <lb/>
            skill, the latter for pecuniary profit. As dialectic, or that part of logic <lb/>
            which is contained in the Topics, has for its subject probable syllogism, <lb/>
            so, the whole of logic is sometimes called dialectic; we must however <lb/>
            remember that in the Topics it has for its subject probable syllogism, <lb/>
            and so far agrees with demonstration in that it teaches the method of <lb/>
            reasoning probably, as the other does demonstratively, the difference be­ <lb/>
            ing that demonstrative logic is conversant, not with every matter, but <lb/>
            alone with what is appropriate to itself, viz. demonstration and syllogism. <lb/>
            The dialectic of Plato, different in form, is in object identical with the <lb/>
            Metaphysics of Aristotle; besides, the latter delivers many arguments <lb/>
            about one problem, but the former, one method about many problems. <lb/>
            Upon the connexion between dialectic and rhetoric, the last being re­ <lb/>
            garded as an offshoot from the first and politics, vide Rhetoric, b. i. ch. <lb/>
            I and 2. The comparison of Zeno, of the difference between dialectic <lb/>
            and rhetoric, to the hand open and closed, is well known, the fault of the <lb/>
            simile being, that had it been stated exactly converse, it would have been <lb/>
            nearer the truth. </note><note type="footnote"> The term " places," Aristotle uses (Rhet. b. i. ch. 2) for those forms <lb/>
            of reasoning, properly logical or rhetorical, which apply to numerous <lb/>
            subjects, differing in species, but the term " place" seems assumed in <lb/>
            one way by rhetoricians, with Cicero in his topics, and in another way <lb/>
            by Alexander and the dialecticians, with Aristotle here: thus Cicero <lb/>
            defines a place " a seat of argument,” and Quintilian " a seat of arguments <lb/>
            in which they are latent, and from which they are to be derived;” where­ <lb/>
            as the dialecticians held these <foreign xml:lang="grc">τόποι</foreign> as universal propositions latent in <lb/>
            certain seats, which may be assumed as the principles of a dialectic syl­ <lb/>
            logism. But we must observe with Dr. Hessey, that Aristotle is not so <lb/>
            exact as we might have expected in the use of the terms which he em­ <lb/>
            ploys, and that every general statement or common principle may, on the <lb/>
            Stagirite's own authority, be called a rOTrO, or <foreign xml:lang="grc">στοιχε</foreign>ĩ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ον</foreign>. (Cf. Cicero de <lb/>
            Inven. Rhet. lib. ii. c. 4; Cic. Topica; Sanderson's Logic, lib. iii.; Lord <lb/>
            Bacon's " Colours of Good and Evil;” also Hessey's Introd. and table i.) <lb/>
            It will be sufficient if we consider <foreign xml:lang="grc">τόποι</foreign> as general principles of proba­ <lb/>
            bility, standing in the same relation to the dialectic syllogism, as the <lb/>
            axioms to the demonstrative. Cf. the definition given Rhet. ii. 26 : and <lb/>
            as Mansel observes, the origin of the name may be illustrated by calling <lb/>
            it the place in which we look for middle terms. Of these loci, ther</note> <pb n="359"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. I.]"/>logism is and what are its differences, in order that the dia­ <lb/>
            lectic syllogism may be apprehended, for we investigate this <lb/>
            in the proposed treatise.</p>
          <p>A syllogism then is a discourse in which, cer­ <lb/>
            tain things being laid down, something different <lb/>
            from the posita happens from necessity through <lb/>
            the things laid down.1* Demonstration indeed is <lb/>
            when a syllogism consists of things true and pri­ <lb/>
            mary,† or of such a kind as assume the principle <lb/>
            of the knowledge concerning them through certain <lb/>
            things primary and true ; but the dialectic syllo­ <lb/>
            gism is that which is collected from probabilities. <lb/>
            2. Definition of <lb/>
            syllogism. Dis­ <lb/>
            tinction be­ <lb/>
            tween the de­ <lb/>
            monstrative <lb/>
            and the dia­ <lb/>
            lectic. <lb/>
            * Vide Anal. <lb/>
            Prior ii. ch. 1. <lb/>
            t Vide Anal. <lb/>
            Post. b. i. ch. <lb/>
            2 and 4. <lb/>
            Things true and primary indeed are those which obtain be­ <lb/>
            lief, not through others, but through themselves, as there is <lb/>
            no necessity to investigate the “why " in scientific principles, <lb/>
            but each principle itself ought to be credible by <lb/>
            itself. Probabilities however are those which <lb/>
            appear to all, or to most men, or to the wise, and <lb/>
            to these either to all or to the greater number, <lb/>
            or to such as are especially renowned and illus­ <lb/>
            trious. Moreover a contentious syllogism is one <lb/>
            which is constructed from apparent, but not real <lb/>
            3. Definition of <lb/>
            probabilities <lb/>
            (ra <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔνδοξα</foreign>). <lb/>
            Rhet. ii. 25 ; <lb/>
            Poet. ch. 9. <lb/>
            4.Of the conten­ <lb/>
            tious syllogism. <lb/>
            (’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Εριστιϰὸς <lb/>
            συλλ</foreign>.) <lb/>
            probabilities, and which appears to consist of probabilities, or <lb/>
            of apparent probabilities.2 For not every thing which appears <note type="footnote"> were two kinds, which the schoolmen call Maximæ and Differentiæ <lb/>
            Maximarum; the former being propositions expressive of a general prin­ <lb/>
            ciple of probability and extending even to axioms, the latter consisting of <lb/>
            one or more words, expressing the point in which one maxim differed <lb/>
            from another; with Aristotle however the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τόποι</foreign> are always propositions. <lb/>
            (Upon the word maxim, vide Sir W. Hamilton Reid's Works, p. 766; <lb/>
            Petro Hisp. Tract, v.) Since therefore dialectic is the art of syllogizing <lb/>
            probably, concerning every matter, which cannot be done without know­ <lb/>
            ing certain "places" and certain “maximæ,” the principles of syllogiz­ <lb/>
            ing probably, dialectic should be principally employed in delivering and <lb/>
            explaining these places and maximæ, and hence it is called Topics from <lb/>
            its principal part, and this treatise is inscribed a treatise on Topics. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 This definition is thus translated by Aulus Gellius, xv. 26. Oratio in <lb/>
            quâ consensis quibusdam et concessis aliud quid quam quæ concessa sunt, <lb/>
            per ea, quæ concessa sunt necessario conficitur. It will be remarked, that <lb/>
            the introduction of the word concessis strictly limits the definition to the <lb/>
            topical syllogism. Cf. Trendelenburg, Elem. sec. 21. Wallis, ii. 22 and 23. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Upon the eristic syllogism, or, as Whately calls it, the art of wrangling, <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK I"/>probable is so, since none of those which are called probable <lb/>
            has entirely the superficial image (of probability), as happens <lb/>
            to be the case about the principles of contentious arguments, <lb/>
            since immediately, and for the most part, the nature of the false <lb/>
            in them is evident even to those who have small perception. <lb/>
            Let then the first of the syllogisms called contentious, be also <lb/>
            called a syllogism, but let the other be a contentious syllogism, <lb/>
            yet not a syllogism (simply), since it appears indeed to draw <lb/>
            an inference, but does not collect one.</p>
          <p>5. Of paralo­ <lb/>
            gisms which <lb/>
            consist of <lb/>
            things appro­ <lb/>
            priate to cer­ <lb/>
            tain sciences.</p>
          <p>Besides all the above-named syllogisms, there <lb/>
            are paralogisms, which consist of things peculiar <lb/>
            to certain sciences, as happens to be the case in <lb/>
            geometry, and those (sciences) allied to it. For <lb/>
            this mode seems to differ from the syllogisms <lb/>
            enumerated, since he who describes falsely, neither syllogizes <lb/>
            from the true and primary, nor from the probable, for he does <lb/>
            * i. e. the defini­ <lb/>
            tion of the pro­ <lb/>
            bable does not <lb/>
            accord to the <lb/>
            things he uses. <lb/>
            t i. e. from pro­ <lb/>
            positions. <lb/>
            not fall into definition,. since he neither assumes <lb/>
            things which appear to all men, nor those which <lb/>
            appear to the greater number, nor to the wise, and <lb/>
            to these neither to all, nor to the greater part, nor <lb/>
            to the most famous; but he makes a syllogism <lb/>
            from assumptions,† appropriate indeed to science, <lb/>
            yet not from the true, as either by describing <lb/>
            semicircles not as they ought to be, or by drawing certain <lb/>
            lines not as they ought to be drawn, he produces a paralogism.</p>
          <p>6. The method <lb/>
            proposed does <lb/>
            not contem­ <lb/>
            plate accuracy <lb/>
            of detail.</p>
          <p>Let then the species of syllogisms, to compre­ <lb/>
            hend them summarily, be those which I have <lb/>
            stated, and in a word, to sum up all that have been <lb/>
            spoken of, and those which shall be mentioned <lb/>
            hereafter, let our definition be so far given, because we do <lb/>
            not propose to deliver an accurate description of any of these, <lb/>
            but wish merely to run through them briefly, thinking it quite <lb/>
            sufficient according to the proposed method, in some way or <lb/>
            other to be able to know each of them.</p>

            upon every proposed subject. But for conversation (it is use­ <lb/>
            ful), because having enumerated the opinions of the many, we <lb/>
            shall converse with them, not from foreign, but from appro­ <lb/>
            priate dogmas, confuting whatever they appear to us to have <lb/>
            erroneously stated. Again, (it is useful) for philosophical sci­ <lb/>
            ence, because being able to dispute on both sides, we shall <lb/>
            more easily perceive in each the true and the false; also, (it <lb/>
            is applicable) to the first principles of each science, since we <lb/>
            cannot say any thing about these from the appropriate princi. <lb/>
            pIes of a proposed science, as they are the first <lb/>
            principles of all, but we must necessarily discuss <lb/>
            these- through probabilities in the singulars. <lb/>
            This however is peculiar, or especially appropri­ <lb/>

            structed, and how we may be well provided with <lb/>
            these, we shall sufficiently gain our point. Now those <lb/>
            things are equal and the same in number from <lb/>
            which arguments are constructed, and about which <lb/>
            syllogisms are conversant; for arguments are constructed <lb/>

            position and <lb/>
            problem shows <lb/>
            either genus, <lb/>
            property, ac­ <lb/>
            cident, or deft­ <lb/>
            nition.—Each <lb/>
            of these per se <lb/>
            not a problem <lb/>
            nor a prop. <lb/>
            versant are problems.1 Now every proposition <lb/>
            and every problem shows either genus, property, <lb/>
            or accident ; for difference, being generic, we <lb/>
            must place together with genus. Since however <lb/>
            of property, one kind signifies the very nature of <lb/>
            a thing, but the other does not signify it, let pro­ <lb/>
            perty be divided into the two above-named parts, <lb/>
            and let what signifies the very nature of a thing <lb/>
            be called definition, but let the other, according to the com­ <lb/>
            mon appellation attributed about these, be called property. <lb/>
            Now it is clear from what we have said, that according to the <lb/>
            present division it happens that all are four, either property, <lb/>
            or definition, or genus, or accident. Let however no one <lb/>
            suppose that we say that each of these asserted by itself is a <lb/>
            proposition or a problem, but that problems and propositions <lb/>
            3. That problem <lb/>
            and prop. dif­ <lb/>
            fer in mode. <lb/>
            are produced from these. Still a problem and a <lb/>
            proposition differ in mode, since when it is thus <lb/>
            said, is a pedestrian biped animal the definition <lb/>
            of man ?2 and is animal the genus of man ? there is a propo­ <lb/>
            sition, but if (it should be said), whether is a pedestrian biped <lb/>
            animal the definition of man or not ? there is a problem. So <lb/>
            also in other things. Wherefore with propriety problems and <lb/>
            propositions are equal in number, for from every proposition <lb/>
            you will make a problem by changing the mode. <note type="footnote"> 1 The sense of <foreign xml:lang="grc">προβλημα</foreign> in Anal. Prior i. 4, and i. 26, does not dif­ <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>WE must describe what definition, property, genus, and ac­ <lb/>
            cident are. Now definition is a sentence signi­ <lb/>
            fying what a thing is: and either a sentence is <lb/>
            employed instead of a noun,* or a sentence in­ <lb/>
            stead of a sentence,† since it is possible to define <lb/>
            some things which are signified by a sentence. As <lb/>
            many however as in some way or other make the <lb/>
            explanation by a noun,‡ evidently do not explain <lb/>
            the definition of the thing, since every definition <lb/>
            is a certain sentence. Still we must refer a thing <lb/>
            of this kind to definition, as that the becoming is <lb/>
            beautiful; in like manner also whether sense and <lb/>
            science are the same or different, since about these <lb/>
            definitions, whether they are the same or different, <lb/>
            there is a very great discussion.' In short, how­ <lb/>
            ever, all things may be called definitive which <lb/>
            are under the same method with definitions, but <lb/>
            1. What <unclear/>(<foreign xml:lang="grc">δροι</foreign>) <lb/>
            definition is, <lb/>
            and of certain <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὸριϰά</foreign>). Cf.Top. <lb/>
            vi. 4 and 14, <lb/>
            and i. 8; also <lb/>
            Metap. vi. 11, <lb/>
            De Anim. i. 1. <lb/>
            * As, " man ” <lb/>
            is a rational <lb/>
            mortal animal. <lb/>

            to bear adversi­ <lb/>
            ty with forti­ <lb/>
            tude and pros­ <lb/>
            perity with mo­ <lb/>
            deration." <lb/>
            t i. e. to ex­ <lb/>
            press an un­ <lb/>
            known by a <lb/>
            known word. <lb/>
            that all which have been spoken of are of this kind is evident <lb/>
            from these (considerations). For when we are able to argue <lb/>
            that a thing is the same and that it is different, we shall by <lb/>
            the same manner be well supplied with arguments about defi­ <lb/>
            nitions, since when we have shown that it is not the same <lb/>
            we shall have upset the definition. Still what is <lb/>
            now said is not converted, since it is not enough to <lb/>
            construct a definition to show that it is the same,§ <lb/>
            but for the subversion of definition it is sufficient <lb/>
            to show that it is not the same thing. <lb/>
            § Thus a gar­ <lb/>
            ment and a <lb/>
            vestment are <lb/>
            the same, but <lb/>
            neither of them <lb/>
            a definition. <note type="footnote"> 1 Cf. An. Post. ii. 10; De Int. 5; Alex. Schol. p. 743, a. 31; and <lb/>
            Philop. Schol. p. 244, b. 31. Though synonyms are denied to be real <lb/>
            definitions by Aristotle, and admitted only as <foreign xml:lang="grc">όριϰά</foreign>, yet as nominal defi­ <lb/>
            nitions, they are allowed by Alexander on Metap. vi. 4, p. 422, ed. Bonitz: <lb/>
            but the genuineness of this portion of the commentary is questionable <lb/>
            Vide Mansel's Appendix, p. 13; Hill's, Wallis's, and Whately's Logic upon <lb/>
            Definitions. From the portions of his works quoted in the margin, it will <lb/>
            be seen that Aristotle entirely rejects physical and accidental (so called) <lb/>
            definition : Aldrich's error as to the former, is well enunciated by Albert <lb/>
            de Præd. Tract, i. ch. 6, and by Occam, pt. i. ch. 26. The only proper <lb/>
            definition is metaphysical, by genus and differentiae, so that it follows that <lb/>
            summa genera which have no differentiæ, and individuals which are distin­ <lb/>
            guished only by accidents, are not definable, but that the only definable <lb/>
            notion is a species. Cf. Met. iT. 3. </note></p><pb n="364"/>

          <p>2. Of property <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἵδιον</foreign>). Cf. <lb/>
            Top. lib. v., <lb/>
            and Porphyry's <lb/>
            Isagoge.</p>
          <p>Property, indeed, is that which does not show <lb/>
            what a thing is, but is present to it alone, and <lb/>
            reciprocates with the thing. As it is the pro­ <lb/>
            perty of a man to be capable of grammar, for if <lb/>
            he is a man he is capable of grammar, and if he is capable of <lb/>
            grammar he is a man ; since no one calls property that which <lb/>
            may possibly be present with something else, as sleep to a <lb/>
            man, not even if it should happen at a certain time to be <lb/>
            present with him alone. If then any thing of this kind <lb/>
            should be called property, it will not be called property simply, <lb/>
            but at a certain time or with reference to something, since to <lb/>
            be on the right hand is sometimes a property, but biped hap­ <lb/>
            pens to be called property with reference to something, as to <lb/>
            man with reference to horse and dog; but that nothing which <lb/>
            may possibly be present with something else is reciprocally <lb/>
            predicated is clear, since it is not necessary if any thing sleeps <lb/>
            that it should be a man.1</p>
          <p>3. Of genus. <lb/>
            (Top. lib. iv. <lb/>
            Porphyry's <lb/>
            Isagoge, 2.) <lb/>
            Whately, <lb/>
            Wallis, Aldrich, <lb/>
            and Mansel.</p>
          <p>Genus, however, is that which is predicated of <lb/>
            many things differing in species, in (answer to) <lb/>
            what a thing is; but let those things be said to be <lb/>
            predicated in (answer to) what a thing is, which <lb/>
            are fitted to answer the person inquiring what <lb/>
            the proposed thing is, as it is adapted to man, when it is <lb/>
            asked what the proposed thing is, to say that he is animal. <lb/>
            Moreover it is generic,2 whether one thing is in the same <lb/>
            genus with another or in a different genus, since such a <lb/>
            thing falls under the same method with genus, as having <lb/>
            discussed that animal is the genus of man, and in like man­ <lb/>
            ner of ox, we shall reason that they are in the same genus; <lb/>
            if, however, we should show that it is the genus of one of <lb/>
            • Cf. Crakant. <lb/>
            Log. lib. ii. 5. <lb/>
            them, but not of the other, we shall reason that <lb/>
            these are not in the same genus.-<note type="footnote"> I Porphyry with Arist. does not distinguish property from accident, <lb/>
            as flowing necessarily from the essence, but as co-extensive, and simply <lb/>
            convertible with its subject: the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἵδιον</foreign> of the former corresponds to the <lb/>
            property, " quod convenit omni soli et semper." (Aldrich's Logic; Porph. <unclear/> <lb/>
            Isag. xiv.) On the principles of Arist. and Porph. a generic property <lb/>
            can only be regarded as an <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἵδιον</foreign>, with respect to the highest species of <lb/>
            which it is predicable. (Cf. Avicenna and Albert de Prædicab. Tract. <lb/>
            ix. c. 1.) Porphyry makes difference, property, and accident, alike to <lb/>
            be predicated iv <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῴ ὸπο</foreign>ĩó<foreign xml:lang="grc">ν τί έστιν</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 i. e. it ought to be discussed by the same method as genus: Taylor. <lb/>

          <p>Accident, again, is that which is not any of these, <lb/>
            neither definition, nor property, nor genus; yet it <lb/>
            is present with a thing, and is that which may <lb/>
            possibly be present with some one and the same <lb/>

            thing and may not be present,1 as, to sit may be and may not <lb/>
            be present with some one and the same thing, and in like man­ <lb/>
            ner whiteness, for there is nothing to prevent the same thing <lb/>
            being at one time white and at another not white. Now of <lb/>
            these definitions of accident, the second is the better; since <lb/>
            when the first is stated, it is necessary in order to understand <lb/>
            it, to know previously what definition genus and property <lb/>
            are, but the second is self-sufficient for the know­ <lb/>
            ledge per se of what the thing asserted is.t To <lb/>
            accident also let comparisons of things with each <lb/>
            t i. e. what <lb/>
            accident is. <lb/>
            other belong, in whatever way they are derived from acci­ <lb/>
            dent, as, whether the honourable or the advantageous be pre­ <lb/>
            ferable, and whether a life of virtue or of enjoyment is the <lb/>
            sweeter, and if there happens to be any other assertion similar <lb/>
            to these, for in all things of this kind, the question arises as <lb/>
            to which the predicate rather happens to belong.2 Still from <lb/>
            these it is manifest that there is nothing to prevent accident <lb/>
            sometimes, and with reference to something, becoming pro­ <lb/>
            perty, as to sit being accident, when some one <lb/>
            alone sits, will then be a property, but one not ‡ ‡ So Bekker and Waitz. <lb/>
            sitting alone, it will be a property with refer­ <lb/>
            ence to those who do not sit, so that nothing prevents acci­ <lb/>
            dent from becoming property in a certain relation and at <lb/>
            a certain time; simply, however, it will not be property. <note type="footnote"> 1 Of accidents, some belong to a class, others to an individual: of the <lb/>
            former, those are inseparable, which, though not connected with the <lb/>

            members of the class, and can be the predicates. Of an universal pro­ <lb/>

          <p>1. Whatever is <lb/>
            advanced <lb/>
            against genus, <lb/>
            pioperty, and <lb/>
            accident is <lb/>
            subversive of <lb/>
            definition, but <lb/>
            an universal <lb/>
            method is not <lb/>
            for this reason <lb/>
            to be looked for. <lb/>
            * Which is <lb/>
            subverted if <lb/>
            shown not pre­ <lb/>
            sent with a <lb/>
            thing alone. <lb/>
            t So as to sub­ <lb/>
            vert it.</p>
          <p>NEVERTHELESS we must not forget that every <lb/>
            thing which is referred to property, genus, and <lb/>
            accident will also be adapted to definitions, for <lb/>
            by showing that a thing is not present with that <lb/>
            alone which is under definition, as in the case of <lb/>
            property,- or that what is given in the definition is <lb/>
            not genus, or that some one of those things stated <lb/>
            in the definition is not present, which may also <lb/>
            be said in accident,† we shall have subverted the <lb/>
            definition ; so that, on account of the reason given <lb/>
            before, all those things which have been enumer­ <lb/>
            ated will after a certain manner be definitive. <lb/>
            Nevertheless we must not on this account look for one <lb/>
            method universal in all things, as neither is it easy to dis­ <lb/>
            cover this, and if it were discovered it would be altogether <lb/>
            obscure and useless to the proposed treatise. But a pecu­ <lb/>

            and accident. <lb/>

            appropriate to each. Wherefore, as we have be­ <lb/>
            fore said,§ we must make a rough division, but of <lb/>
            the rest we must join those which are especially <lb/>
            appropriate to each,|| denominating them both <lb/>
            definitive and generic. What, however, have <lb/>
            been set forth have almost been adapted to each.1</p>

            be divided triply, since we are accustomed to de <lb/>
            nominate a thing the same, in number, or in spe­ <lb/>
            cies, or in genus; in number indeed when the <lb/>
            names are many but the thing one, as a garment <lb/>
            number, spe­ <lb/>
            cies, or genus,. <lb/>
            a case resolved. <lb/>
            Cf. Metap. lib. <lb/>
            iv. (v.), Leip­ <lb/>
            sic, ch. 9; also <lb/>
            lib. IX. (x.). <lb/>
            and a vestment, but in species when the things being many <lb/>
            are without specific difference, as man with man, and horse <lb/>
            with horse, for such things are said to be the same in species <lb/>
            as are under the same species: in like manner also, those are <lb/>
            the same in genus which are under the same genus, as horse <lb/>
            with man. Nevertheless, it may seem indeed that water from <lb/>
            the same fountain, being called the same, has a certain differ­ <lb/>
            ence besides the modes enumerated, yet such a thing must be <lb/>
            placed at least in the same arrangement with those, which are in <lb/>
            some way or other said to be under one species, for all such <lb/>
            things appear to be of a kindred nature and similar to each <lb/>
            other, since all water is said to be the same in species with all <lb/>
            water, because of the possession of a certain similarity ; but <lb/>
            water from the same fountain differs in nothing else except that <lb/>
            the similarity is greater;1 wherefore we do not separate it from <lb/>
            those which some way or other are said to be ac­ <lb/>
            cording to one species.* Confessedly, however, <lb/>
            that which is one in number, seems especially <lb/>
            to be called the same, by all men; still we usually <lb/>
            attribute this in many ways, most properly indeed <lb/>
            and chiefly, when " same" is attributed in name <lb/>
            * Cf. Waitz, <lb/>
            vol. ii. p. 446. <lb/>

            ally called same <lb/>
            which do not <lb/>
            differ in num­ <lb/>
            ber : how this <lb/>
            is attributed. <lb/>
            or definition, as garment to a vestment, and animal pedestrian <lb/>
            biped, to man ; secondly, when (it is attributed) in property, <lb/>
            as what is susceptible of science to man, and what naturally is <lb/>
            carried upwards, to fire; thirdly, when from accident, as that <lb/>
            which sits or is musical, to Socrates. For all these would <lb/>
            signify one thing in number, and that what we have now said <lb/>
            is true, a person may especially learn, from those who change <lb/>
            appellations ; for frequently when we desire to call some one <lb/>
            who is sitting, by name, we change (the appellation), when <lb/>
            he to whom we give the order, does not happen to understand, <lb/>
            as if he would rather understand from accidents, and we <lb/>
            desire him to call to us, the person who is sitting or discours- <note type="footnote"> 1 This is, between waters flowing from the same, than from different <lb/>

            ing, evidently considering it the same thing to <lb/>

          <p>1. Proof by in­ <lb/>
            duction that <lb/>
            disputations <lb/>
            are composed <lb/>
            of the forego­ <lb/>

          <p>THAT disputations are composed from the things <lb/>
            mentioned before, and through these, and pertain <lb/>
            to 2 these, we have the first evidence through in­ <lb/>
            duction, since if any one considers each of the <lb/>
            propositions and problems, it will appear to have <lb/>
            originated either from definition, or from property, or from <lb/>
            2. By syllo­ <lb/>
            gismo (Cf. Met. <lb/>
            vi. 4,12,16 and <lb/>

            Bonitz. <lb/>
            genus, or from accident. Another evidence how­ <lb/>
            ever is by syllogism, for it is necessary that every <lb/>
            thing which is predicated of a certain thing, <lb/>
            should either reciprocate with that thing or not. <lb/>
            And if indeed it reciprocates it will be definition <lb/>
            or property, since if it signifies what a thing is, it is definition, <lb/>
            but if it does not signify it, it is property, for this was property, <lb/>
            viz. that which reciprocates indeed, but does not signify what <lb/>
            a thing is. If however it does not reciprocate with the thing, <lb/>
            it either is one of those which are predicated in the definition <lb/>
            of the subject, or it is not, and if it is one of those predicated <lb/>
            in the definition it would be genus or difference, since defini­ <lb/>
            tion consists of genus and differences, but if it is not of those <lb/>
            predicated in definition, it would be evidently accident, for <lb/>
            that was said to be accident which is neither definition, nor <lb/>
            genus, nor property, yet is present with a thing. <note type="footnote"> 1 Sundry attempts have been made, not very successfully, to recon. <lb/>
            cile Aristotle's account here with that of Porphyry. Every proposition, <lb/>
            according to Aristotle, expresses one of four relations of the predicate to <lb/>
            its subject, for every predicate must either be convertible with its subject <lb/>
            or not; if convertible, it either expresses the whole essence (ro ri <unclear>ὔι</unclear> <unclear/> <lb/>

            in the latter " property." If not convertible, it either expresses part of <lb/>
            the essence or not; in the former case it is genus, in the latter accident. <lb/>

          <p>WE must next define the genera of the Cate­ <lb/>

            by which it is <lb/>
            shown, that the <lb/>
            predicables are <lb/>
            always in one <lb/>
            of the catego­ <lb/>

            differences. <lb/>

            lib. iv. <lb/>
            what a thing is, or quality, or quantity, or some other cate­ <lb/>
            gory.1 Moreover, it is evident from these that he who signi­ <lb/>
            fies what a thing is, at one time signifies substance, at another <lb/>
            quality, and at another some other category. For when man <lb/>
            being proposed, he says that the thing proposed is man or <lb/>
            animal, he says what it is, and signifies substance ; but when <lb/>
            white colour being proposed, he says that the thing proposed <lb/>
            is white or colour, he says what it is, and signifies quality. <lb/>
            So also, if when the magnitude of one cubit is proposed, he <lb/>
            says that what is proposed is a cubit in size, he will say what <lb/>
            it is, and will signify quantity, and so of the rest, for each <lb/>
            of these, both if it be itself predicated of itself <lb/>
            and if genus (be predicated) of it, signifies what <lb/>
            a thing is. When however (it is spoken) of an­ <lb/>
            other thing,§ it does not signify what it is, but <lb/>
            quantity or quality, or some other category, so <lb/>
            that the things about which || and from which || <lb/>
            arguments (subsist), are these and so many; but <lb/>
            how we shall take them, and by what we shall <lb/>

          <p>1. Definition <lb/>
            of a dialectic <lb/>
            proposition.</p>
          <p>IN the first place then let us define what is a dia­ <lb/>
            lectic proposition, and what a dialectic problem, <lb/>
            for we must not suppose every proposition nor <lb/>
            every problem as dialectic, since no one in his senses would <lb/>
            propose that which is assented to by no one, nor would he ad­ <lb/>
            vance as a question what was palpable to all, or to most men, <lb/>
            for the latter does not admit of a doubt, but the former no one <lb/>
            would admit. Indeed a dialectic proposition is an interroga­ <lb/>
            tion, probable either to all, or to the most, or to the wise; and <lb/>
            to these, either to all or most, or to the most celebrated, it is not <lb/>
            paradoxical, as any one may admit what is assented to by the</p>
          <p>* Cf. Rhet. ii. <lb/>
            25 ; Poet. ch. 9 <lb/>
            and 15.</p>
          <p>wise, if it be not contrary to the opinions of the <lb/>
            multitude.- Dialectic propositions however are <lb/>
            both those which resemble the probable and which <lb/>
            are contrary to those which appear probable, being proposed</p>
          <p>t i. e. which <lb/>
            accord to the <lb/>
            precepts of <lb/>
            some known <lb/>
            art. <lb/>
            2. What are <lb/>
            probable.</p>
          <p>through contradiction, and whatever opinions are <lb/>
            according to the discovered arts.† For if it be <lb/>
            probable that there is the same science of con­ <lb/>
            traries, it would also appear probable that the <lb/>
            sense of contraries is the same, and if the gram­ <lb/>
            matical art be one in number, that there is one <lb/>
            art also of playing on the pipe, but if there are many <lb/>
            grammatical arts, there will also be many piping arts, for all <lb/>
            these things seem to be similar and akin. So also those <lb/>
            things which are contrary to probabilities, being proposed <lb/>
            according to contradiction, will appear probable, for if it is <lb/>
            probable that we ought to benefit friends, it is also proba­ <lb/>
            ble that we ought not to injure them. Nevertheless, that <lb/>
            we ought to injure friends is contrary,1 but that we ought <lb/>
            not to injure them is contradictory; so also if we ought to <lb/>
            benefit friends, we ought not to benefit enemies; but this also <lb/>
            is according to the contradiction of contraries, since the con­ <lb/>

            pear in comparison to be the contrary about the contrary, as, <lb/>
            if we ought to benefit friends, we ought also to injure ene­ <lb/>

            injuring enemies, yet whether it is truly so or not, will be <lb/>
            shown in what we say about contraries. Notwithstanding, it <lb/>
            is apparent that whatever opinions also are according to the <lb/>
            arts, are dialectic propositions; since any one would admit <lb/>
            those things, which are assented to by persons conversant with <lb/>

            Let then problems and propositions be dis­ <lb/>
            tinguished as we have said : a thesis, on the other <lb/>
            hand, is a paradoxical judgment t of some one <lb/>
            celebrated in philosophy, as that contradiction is <lb/>
            impossible, as Antisthenes said, or that all things <lb/>
            are moved, according to Heraclitus, or that being <lb/>
            is one, as Melissus asserted,' for to notice any <lb/>
            casual person setting forth contrarieties to (common) opinions <lb/>
            2. Another. <lb/>
            is silly. Or (a thesis is an opinion) of things <lb/>
            concerning which we have a reason contrary to <lb/>
            opinions, as tnat not every thIng which is, is eitner generated <lb/>
            or perpetual, as the sophists declare, since (they say) that a <lb/>
            t Because once <lb/>
            he was not. <lb/>
            musician is a grammarian, though he is neither <lb/>
            generated2 nor eternal,‡ for this, even if it be <lb/>

          <p>3. Distinction <lb/>
            between thesis <lb/>
            and problem.</p>
          <p>A thesis then is also a problem, yet not every <lb/>
            problem is a thesis, since some problems are of <lb/>
            such a kind, as that we form an opinion about <lb/>
            them in neither way; but that a thesis is also a problem <note type="footnote">I Generation with Plato, and motion with Aristotle, signify mutation. <lb/>

            subject of grammar or the boundary from which: since every thing is said <lb/>
            to be generated from a subject and matter, as a statue from brass; or <lb/>
            from a contrary boundary, as black from white. But a musician is neither <lb/>
            the matter subject to a grammarian, for that is man; nor a contrary <lb/>
            boundary, for the same person is at the same time a musician and a <lb/>
            grammarian. This sophism is solved by saying, that the musician is not <lb/>
            generated per se but from accident: and the grammarian is generated <lb/>
            so far as the being a musician happens to a man who becomes a gram­ <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. XII.]"/>is evident, as it is necesary from what we have said, either <lb/>
            that the multitude should be at variance with the wise about <lb/>
            the thesis, or one or other of these with themselves, since a <lb/>
            thesis is a certain paradoxical judgment. Now almost all <lb/>
            dialectical problems are called theses, let it, however, make <lb/>
            no difference how they are called, as we have not thus divided <lb/>
            them from a desire to fabricate names, but that <lb/>
            we may not be ignorant what are their real <lb/>
            differences.* <lb/>

            blem and a <lb/>
            thesis.</p>
          <p>Still we need not consider every problem nor <lb/>
            every thesis, but that which any one may be in <lb/>

            which it is very remote, for the one do not admit <lb/>
            of doubt, but the other, of greater (doubt) than <lb/>

            there are three propositions of these,1 since it is possible to <lb/>
            make a proposition as to each of them, as that the beautiful, <lb/>
            or the sweet, or the profitable is eligible, and that sense differs <lb/>

            qualities, but others from being effective of something, and <lb/>
            not from themselves being certain qualities, and indeed in a <lb/>
            similar manner in other things.</p>
          <p>2. Ambiguity <lb/>
            ascertainable <lb/>
            from the di­ <lb/>
            versity of con­ <lb/>
            traries.</p>
          <p>Whether however a thing is predicated multi­ <lb/>
            fariously, or in one way in species, we must in­ <lb/>
            vestigate through these. First, we must consider <lb/>
            in the contrary, if it is multifariously predicated, <lb/>
            whether it differs in species or in name, for some things im­ <lb/>
            mediately differ even in names, as the grave is contrary in <lb/>
            voice to the sharp, but in magnitude the obtuse. Therefore <lb/>
            it is clear that the contrary to the sharp is predicated multi­ <lb/>
            * The grave <lb/>
            and the obtuse. <lb/>
            fariously, but if this be so, the sharp also is, for <lb/>
            according to each of these,. the contrary will be <lb/>
            different, since the same sharp will not be contrary <lb/>
            to the obtuse and to the grave, but the sharp will be contrary <lb/>
            to each. Again, to the heavy in voice, the sharp is contrary, <lb/>
            but in weight, the light,1 so that the heavy is predicated mul- <note type="footnote"> 1 It is almost needless to remark that <foreign xml:lang="grc">βαρὺς</foreign> in Greek, and gravis in <lb/>
            Latin, signify both the grave in sound, and gravity or weight. Upon the <lb/>
            subject of ambiguity, see Whately's Logic. In English, of course from <lb/>
            its great resemblance to the Greek in many particulars, ambiguous terms <lb/>
            abound, and both predicate and subject are often, especially in Shaks­ <lb/>
            peare, made to run through all the changes of " equivoque;" in fact. as <lb/>
            was once observed, " a pun was the Cleopatra for which Shakspeare, like <lb/>
            Antony, lost the world, and was content to lose it." As an instance in </note> <pb n="377"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. XV.]"/>tifariously since the contrary also is. Likewise to the beau­ <lb/>
            tiful in an animal, the ugly, but in a family, the depraved (is <lb/>
            contrary), so that the beautiful is equivocal.</p>
          <p>In some, indeed, there is no dissonance in the <lb/>
            names, but the difference in them is at once palpable <lb/>
            in species, as in white and black, for voice is said <lb/>
            to be clear and obscure. in the same manner as <lb/>
            colour. In these, then, there is no dissonance in <lb/>
            3. Cases where <lb/>
            there is no dis­ <lb/>
            sonance, but <lb/>
            specific differ­ <lb/>
            ence. <lb/>
            * Lit. white <lb/>
            and black. <lb/>
            names, but their difference is at once evident in species, for <lb/>
            colour and voice are not similarly called clear, † <lb/>
            and this is also evident from sense, for of things <lb/>
            t Lit. white. <lb/>
            which are the same in species, the sense is the same; but we <lb/>
            do not judge the lightness which is in voice, and that which <lb/>
            is in colour, by the same sense, but one by sight, and the other, <lb/>
            by hearing. So also the sharp and the obtuse in fluids and <lb/>
            magnitudes, the one indeed by touch, the other by taste, since <lb/>
            neither are these dissonant in names, neither in themselves <lb/>
            nor in the contraries, for what is obtuse is contrary to each.</p>
          <p>Again, we must consider if there is any thing <lb/>
            contrary to the one, but nothing simply to the <lb/>
            other; as, to the pleasure from drinking, the pain <lb/>
            4 Contrary to <lb/>
            either, to be <lb/>
            considered. <lb/>
            from thirst is contrary; but to that which arises from con­ <lb/>
            templating, that the diameter of a square is incommensurable <lb/>
            with its side, there is nothing (contrary), wherefore pleasure <lb/>
            is predicated multifariously. To hate, also, is contrary to the <lb/>
            love which is mental, but nothing to that which subsists ac­ <lb/>
            cording to bodily energy, wherefore it is evident <lb/>
            that to love, is equivocal. Besides, we must con­ <lb/>
            sider the media, if there is a certain medium of <lb/>
            5. Also the <lb/>
            media. <lb/>
            some, but not of others, or whether there is of both, yet not <lb/>
            the same, as of white and black, in colour, the dark brown; <lb/>
            but in voice, there is no medium, unless it be the hoarse, as <note type="footnote"> point, involving the very word given by Aristotle, take 2 Hen. IV. act i. <lb/>
            scene 2: </note><note type="footnote"> “ CH. JUS. You follow the prince up and down, like his in angel. </note><note type="footnote"> " FALS. Not so, my lord; your ill angel is light; but I hope, he that <lb/>
            looks upon me, will take me without weighing; and yet in some respects, <lb/>
            I cannot go, I cannot tell.”—The whole scene is so full of puns, that at <lb/>
            last they grow infectious, (like other bad habits,) and the Chief Justice <lb/>
            himself perpetrates an iniquity at the end, in telling Falstaff, " You are <lb/>
            too impatient to bear crosses;” for which monstrosity he should have <lb/>
            been set in the pillory. </note> <pb n="378"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK I."/>some say that a hoarse voice is the medium; so that white is <lb/>
            equivocal, and black in like manner; yet more, whether there <lb/>
            are many media of some things, but one of others, as in the <lb/>
            case of white and black ; for in colours, there are many media, <lb/>
            but in voice, one, viz. the hoarse.</p>
          <p>6. Also if in the <lb/>
            contradictory, <lb/>
            there is various <lb/>
            predication.</p>
          <p>Again, in that which is contradictorily opposed, <lb/>
            we must consider if it is predicated multifariously, <lb/>
            for if this is multifariously predicated, the oppo­ <lb/>
            site to this also will be enunciated multifariously; <lb/>
            thus, not to see, is predicated in many ways; in one, not to <lb/>
            have sight; in another, not to energize with the sight. Now <lb/>
            if this is multifariously, to see, must necessarily be multi­ <lb/>
            fariously predicated; for to each (signification of the verb) <lb/>
            not to see, there will be something opposed, thus to the not <lb/>
            possessing sight, the possession of it, and to the not ener­ <lb/>
            gizing with the sight, the energizing with it.</p>
          <p>7. Cases of pri­ <lb/>
            vation and ha­ <lb/>
            bit.</p>
          <p>Further, we must remark this, in the case of <lb/>
            those things, which are predicated according to <lb/>
            privation and habit; for if the one, is multifari­ <lb/>
            ously predicated, the other is, also; thus, if to perceive, is pre­ <lb/>
            dicated multifariously, both according to the soul and accord­ <lb/>
            ing to the body, to be deprived of sense, will be multifariously <lb/>
            predicated, i. e. both according to the soul and the body. <lb/>
            Nevertheless, that the particulars now mentioned, are opposed <lb/>
            according to privation and habit, is evident, since animals are <lb/>
            naturally adapted to possess each of the senses, viz. both ac­ <lb/>
            cording to the soul and according to the body.</p>
          <p>8. Also whe­ <lb/>
            ther there is <lb/>
            any ambiguity <lb/>
            in case, etc.</p>
          <p>We must look also to the cases, for if "justly" <lb/>
            is predicated multifariously, "the just" also, will <lb/>
            be multifariously predicated ; for the just subsists <lb/>
            according to each of those which are justly, thus <lb/>
            if justly is predicated, both of judging according to one's own <lb/>
            opinions, and also in a proper manner, the just is similarly. <lb/>
            I Likewise, if the healthy is multifariously, the healthily also, will <lb/>
            be spoken multifariously, as if that is called " healthy," which <lb/>
            produces, preserves, and signifies health, the " healthily" also, <lb/>
            will be predicated either productively, or preservingly, or sig­ <lb/>
            nificantly. And in like manner in other things, when (the <lb/>
            noun) itself is multifariously predicated, the case also derived <lb/>
            from it, will be spoken in many ways, and if the case (the <lb/>
            noun) itself besides.</p><pb n="379"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. XV.]"/>
          <p>We must regard too, the genera of the categories, <lb/>
            as to name, whether they are the same in all <lb/>
            things, since if they are not the same, it is evident <lb/>
            that what is predicated, is equivocal; thus good in <lb/>
            9. Whether the <lb/>
            word belongs <lb/>
            to the same <lb/>
            category. <lb/>
            food is what produces pleasure, in medicine, what produces <lb/>
            health, in the soul, to be of a certain quality, as temperate, or <lb/>
            brave, or just, similarly also in the case of man. Sometimes <lb/>
            indeed it is “the when," as the good in opportunity, for that <lb/>
            is called good, which is in season: frequently also quantity, <lb/>
            for instance, the moderate, for the moderate also is called good, <lb/>
            so that good is equivocal. Likewise clearness. <lb/>
            in respect of body, is colour, but in voice, that <lb/>
            * Lit. TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">λευκὸν</foreign>. <lb/>
            which may easily be heard, and in like manner the acute, for <lb/>
            the same, is not predicated in all things, after the same manner, <lb/>
            for a rapid voice is called acute, as musicians say, who are con­ <lb/>
            versant with numbers; but an angle is acute, which is less than <lb/>
            a right angle, and a sword is acute, which has a sharp point.</p>
          <p>We must also notice the genera, of those <lb/>
            things which are under the same name, whether <lb/>
            they are different and not subaltern, thus <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄνος</foreign> is <lb/>
            both an animal and a vessel, since the definition <lb/>
            10. Genera of <lb/>
            those under the <lb/>
            same name to <lb/>
            be considered. <lb/>
            of them according to the name, is different, for the one will be <lb/>
            said to be a certain kind of animal, but the other a certain <lb/>
            kind of vessel.1 If however the genera are subaltern, the de­ <lb/>
            finitions need not be different, as of a crow, both animal and <lb/>
            bird are the genus, when therefore we say, that a crow is a <lb/>
            bird, we also say, that it is a certain kind of animal, so that <lb/>
            both genera are predicated of it; likewise also when we say <lb/>
            that a crow is a winged biped animal, we say that it is a bird, <lb/>
            and thus then both the general are predicated <lb/>
            of the crow, and also the definition of them.‡ <lb/>
            This nevertheless does not occur in genera which <lb/>
            are not subaltern, since neither when we speak of <lb/>
            a vessel, do (we speak of) an animal, nor when <lb/>
            (we speak of) an animal, (do we mean) a vessel. <lb/>
            + Animal and <lb/>
            bird. <lb/>
            ‡ For when <lb/>
            bird is predi­ <lb/>
            cated of the <lb/>
            crow, animal is <lb/>
            also.</p>
          <p>Not only indeed must we observe whether the <lb/>
            genera of the thing proposed, be different and not <lb/>
            subaltern, but also in regard to the contrary, since <lb/>
            11. If the con­ <lb/>
            trary is vari­ <lb/>
            ously predi­ <lb/>
            cated, the pro- <note type="footnote">1 Of this kind are such words as "pig" (of iron and an animal); <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK I."/>position also <lb/>
            will be. <lb/>
            if the contrary is predicated in several ways, it is <lb/>
            evident that the proposition will be so too.</p>
          <p>12. Definition. <lb/>
            of the compo­ <lb/>
            sites to be ex­ <lb/>
            amined.</p>
          <p><unclear/> As of the <lb/>
            white.</p>
          <p>It is useful also, to regard the definition pro­ <lb/>
            duced from the composite, as of a white body <lb/>
            and white (i. e. clear) voice; for the property <lb/>
            being taken away, it is necessary that the same <lb/>
            definition should be left.- Now this does not <lb/>
            occur in equivocals, for instance, in the things <lb/>
            now spoken of, for the one, will be body having such a colour, <lb/>
            but the other, will be an audible voice; body, then, and voice <lb/>
            being taken away, what remains is not the same in each, at <lb/>
            † Waitz and <lb/>
            Bekker omit <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταὐτόν</foreign>. <lb/>
            least it would be necessary if white, were syno­ <lb/>
            nymous, that what is predicated in each (defini­ <lb/>
            tion), should be (the same). †</p>
          <p>IS. Also the <lb/>
            definition of it­ <lb/>
            self in each <lb/>
            thing.</p>
          <p>Frequently also in the definitions themselves, <lb/>
            the equivocal, which is consequent, escapes us, <lb/>
            wherefore, we must look to the definitions. Thus, <lb/>
            if any one were to say, that what is significant <lb/>
            and productive of health, is that which is symmetrically dis­ <lb/>
            posed with respect to health, we must not leave off, but con­ <lb/>
            sider what he calls symmetrically, in each, as if the one, were <lb/>
            to be of such a kind, as to produce health, but the other, such <lb/>
            as to signify, what is the quality of the habit.</p>
          <p>14. Whether <lb/>
            comparison <lb/>
            subsist, as to <lb/>
            the more, or <lb/>
            similar.</p>
          <p>Moreover, (we are to examine) whether they <lb/>
            may not be compared according to the more, or <lb/>
            similarly, as a light voice, and a light garment. <lb/>
            and a sharp flavour, and a sharp voice, for these <lb/>
            are neither called light nor sharp similarly, nor one, more than <lb/>
            the other. So that the light, and the sharp, are equivocal, for <lb/>
            every synonym is capable of comparison, since it will either <lb/>
            be predicated similarly, or one more than the other.</p>
          <p>15. Whether <lb/>
            those under the <lb/>
            same name are <lb/>
            the differences <lb/>
            of different <lb/>
            genera.</p>
          <p>Since however of things heterogeneous and not <lb/>
            subaltern, the differences are also different in spe­ <lb/>
            cies, as of animal and science, (for the differences <lb/>
            of these are diverse,) consider whether those <lb/>
            things, which are under the same name, are the <lb/>
            differences of different, and not of subaltern genera, as the <lb/>
            acute (is the difference) of voice and magnitude, for voice, dif­ <lb/>
            fers from voice, in acuteness, likewise also one mass, from <lb/>
            another, so that the acute is equivocal, for these are the dif­ <lb/>
            ferences of diverse, and not of subaltern, genera.</p><pb n="381"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. XVI. XVII.]"/>
          <p>Again, (observe) whether of things under the <lb/>
            same name, there be divers differences, as of the <lb/>
            chroma1 which belongs to bodies, and of that <lb/>
            which is in melodies, for of that which belongs to <lb/>
            16. Whether <lb/>
            of those under <lb/>
            the same name <lb/>
            there are divert <lb/>
            differences. <lb/>
            bodies, the differences are, that which diffuses, and that which <lb/>
            condenses, the vision, but these are not the same differences of <lb/>
            that which is in melodies, so that chroma is an equivocal word, <lb/>
            for there are the same differences of the same things.</p>
          <p>Once more, since species is not the difference of <lb/>
            any thing,2 notice of those which are under the <lb/>
            same name, whether one is species, but the other, <lb/>
            difference, as bodily clearness is a species of colour, <lb/>
            17. Whether <lb/>
            one is species, <lb/>
            but the other <lb/>
            difference. <lb/>
            but vocal (clearness) is a difference, since voice differs from <lb/>
            voice, in being clear.</p>

            construction.</p>
          <p>To have considered in how many ways a thing <lb/>
            may be predicated, is useful for perspicuity, (as <lb/>
            any one can better know what he admits,1 when <lb/>
            it is clearly explained in how many ways it may <lb/>
            be predicated,) and for the construction of syllo­ <lb/>
            gisms against the thing itself, and not (merely) <lb/>
            against the name. For when it is dubious in how <lb/>
            many ways it is predicated, he who answers, and he who ques­ <lb/>
            tions, may possibly not direct their attention, to the same thing, <lb/>
            but when it is explained in how many ways it is predicated and <lb/>
            with what object a person admits it, the questioner would ap­ <lb/>
            pear ridiculous if he did not frame his argument against this. <lb/>
            3rd. To escape <lb/>
            paralogism,and <lb/>
            to employ it. <lb/>
            But it is also useful that we may not be deceived <lb/>
            (ourselves) by paralogism, and may deceive another <lb/>
            by it, since when we know in how many ways <lb/>
            predication occurs, we can never be deceived by paralogism,2 <lb/>
            but we shall know if the questioner does not argue against the <lb/>
            same thing, and we ourselves, when questioning, shall be able <lb/>
            to deceive by paralogism, except the respondent happens to <lb/>
            know, in how many ways predication occurs. Nevertheless, <lb/>
            this is not possible in all cases, but when of things multifari­ <lb/>
            ously predicated, some are true, but others false;3 this mode <lb/>
            however is not appropriate to dialectic, wherefore a thing of <note type="footnote"> I Or the thesis he defends. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Vide Whately and Hill's Logic. </note><note type="footnote">3 As that the dog barks, for " dog " signifying many things, it would <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. XVIII.]"/>this kind, must be altogether avoided by dialec­ <lb/>
            ticians, viz. arguing against a name, unless any <lb/>
            one should be otherwise incapable of discussing <lb/>
            the proposition. <lb/>
            2. Argument <lb/>
            against a name <lb/>
            to be avoided.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding, it is useful to discover differ­ <lb/>
            ences, in order to (construct) syllogisms of the <lb/>
            same, and of the different, and also to the know­ <lb/>
            ledge of what each thing is. That it is useful <lb/>
            for syllogisms about the same, and the different, <lb/>
            4. This disco­ <lb/>
            very useful to <lb/>
            form syllo­ <lb/>
            gisms of the <lb/>
            same and the <lb/>
            different. <lb/>
            is clear; for when we have discovered the difference of the <lb/>
            things proposed, of whatever kind it may be, we shall have <lb/>
            shown that they are not the same, (and it is useful) for the <lb/>
            knowledge of what a thing is, because we are accustomed to <lb/>
            separate the proper definition of the essence of each thing, by <lb/>
            the peculiar differences of each.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, speculation upon the similar, <lb/>
            is useful for inductive reasons,* t and for hypo­ <lb/>
            thetical syllogisms, and for the statement of de­ <lb/>
            finitions. For inductive reasons then, because by <lb/>
            the induction of similar particulars, we deem it <lb/>
            proper to infer the universal, since it is not easy <lb/>
            to form induction, when we are ignorant of simi­ <lb/>
            lars. (It is useful also for hypothetical syllo­ <lb/>

            5. Speculation <lb/>

            hypothetical <lb/>
            syllogisms. <lb/>
            Method of pro­ <lb/>
            ceeding. <lb/>
            t i. e. to frame <lb/>
            inductions. <lb/>
            gisms, because it is probable that as a thing subsists in one of <lb/>
            those which are similar, so also it does in the rest, so that in <lb/>
            order that we may discuss any of them sufficiently, we should <lb/>
            previously acknowledge, that as a thing is in these, so also is <lb/>
            its condition in the subject proposed; but when we have de­ <lb/>
            monstrated that, we shall also have proved the proposition by <lb/>
            hypothesis, for we have framed a demonstration, upon the <lb/>
            supposition that as a thing is in these, so it is also, in the case <lb/>
            of what is proposed. Again, for the statement of definitions <lb/>
            (it is useful), since being able to comprehend what in each <lb/>
            thing is identical, we shall not be in doubt as to what genus <lb/>
            the thing proposed ought to be referred, in definition ; for oi <lb/>
            those which are common, what is especially predicated in <lb/>
            (the question) what a thing is, will be the genus ; in like man­ <lb/>
            ner in those which are vastly different from each other, the <lb/>
            contemplation of the similar is useful for definitions, as that <lb/>
            tranquillity in the sea, is the same thing as serenity in the air, <lb/>
            (for each of them is quiet,) and that a point in a line (ia <pb n="384"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK II."/>identical) with unity in number, for each is a principle. <lb/>
            3. We define <lb/>
            appropriately <lb/>
            by assigning a <lb/>
            common genus. <lb/>
            4. The instru­ <lb/>
            ments for the <lb/>
            construction of <lb/>
            syllogism are <lb/>
            four, viz. the <lb/>
            assumption of <lb/>
            propositions; <lb/>
            the distinction <lb/>
            of the equivo­ <lb/>
            cal ; the disco­ <lb/>
            very of differ­ <lb/>
            ence ; and the <lb/>
            consideration <lb/>
            of the similar. <lb/>
            Wherefore by assigning the common genus in all <lb/>
            things, we shall appear not to define in a manner <lb/>
            foreign (from the subject), and indeed almost those <lb/>
            who define, are accustomed thus to explain, for <lb/>
            they say that unity is the principle of number, and <lb/>
            that a point is the principle of a line; it is evi­ <lb/>
            dent then that they refer the genus of both to <lb/>
            what is common.</p>
          <p>The instruments therefore by which syllogisms <lb/>
            are constructed, are these; but the places, for <lb/>
            which what we have said, is useful, are those <lb/>
            (which follow).</p>

            however, of problems, those things are common which uni­ <lb/>

            have shown that it is present with no individual, we shall <lb/>

            subversive. <lb/>
            speak, then, of those which are universally sub­ <lb/>
            versive, both because such are common to univer­ <lb/>

            difficulty. <lb/>

            vol. ii. p. 455. <lb/>
            but the disputants subvert them. Nevertheless, <lb/>
            it is most difficult to convert an appropriate <lb/>
            appellation (derived) from accident,- for (to be <lb/>
            inherent) partly, and not universally, is possible <lb/>
            to accidents only, since it is necessary to convert <lb/>
            from definition, property, and genus, as if it is <pb n="385"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. II.]"/>present with a certain thing to be an animal, pedestrian, biped, <lb/>
            it will be true for the person who has converted it, to say, <lb/>
            that it is an animal, pedestrian, biped. Likewise from genus, <lb/>
            for if it is incident to a thing to be an animal, it is an animal; <lb/>
            and it is the same with property, for if it is present with any <lb/>
            to be capable of grammar, it will be capable of grammar, <lb/>
            since nothing of these can be partly present or not present, <lb/>
            but simply present or not present. Yet there is nothing to <lb/>
            prevent accidents from being partly present, for instance, <lb/>
            whiteness or justice,1 so that it is not enough to show that <lb/>
            whiteness or justice is inherent, in order to show that a man is <lb/>
            white or just, since it is doubtful, because he may be partially <lb/>
            white or just, so that conversion is unnecessary in accidents.</p>
          <p>Again, we must determine the errors occurrent <lb/>
            in problems, that they are two, either from false <lb/>
            assertion, or a departure from the established mode <lb/>
            4. Two errors <lb/>
            occurrent in <lb/>
            problems. <lb/>
            of speaking. For both false assertors err, from saying that <lb/>
            what is not present, is present with a certain thing, and those <lb/>
            who call things by foreign names, as a plane tree a man, <lb/>

            ble that he who lays down a thesis, may define according to <lb/>
            denomination (the genus as an accident), e. g. that it is <lb/>
            accidental to justice to be a virtue; frequently, however, <lb/>
            without definition, it is evident that he has given the genus <lb/>
            as an accident, as if any one should have said, that white­ <lb/>

            be) more in the way and in fewer things.1 Still we must <lb/>
            consider and begin from first things, and then (proceed) as <lb/>
            far as individuals, for instance, if a man said that there is the <lb/>
            same science of opposites, we must consider if there is the <lb/>
            same science of relatives, of contraries, and of those which are <lb/>
            enunciated according to privation and habit, and according <lb/>
            to contradiction, and if it should not yet be evident in these, <lb/>
            we must divide them again as far as individuals, as whether <lb/>
            (there is the same science) of the just and the unjust, or of <lb/>
            the double and the half, or of blindness and sight, or of entity <lb/>

          <p>Another (topic) is, to make definitions, both of <lb/>
            accident and of that to which it is accidental, <lb/>
            either of both severally, or of one of them, † then <lb/>
            to consider whether any thing has been assumed <lb/>
            as true, which is not true, in the definitions ; thus <lb/>
            if the (problem) is, that VIle can injure God, (we <lb/>
            must consider) what it is, to injure, for if it be, <lb/>
            to hurt voluntarily, it is evident that God cannot <note type="footnote"> 1 Because species are fewer than individuals, and, in short, things <lb/>
            superior, are fewer than things inferior. </note> <pb n="387"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. II.]"/>possibly be injured, since it is impossible that God can be <lb/>
            hurt. Again, if the worthy man is envious, who is the en­ <lb/>
            vious, and what is envy, (must be considered,) for if envy be <lb/>
            pain at the apparent success of some worthy person, it is evi­ <lb/>
            dent that a worthy man is not envious, for if so, he would be <lb/>
            depraved, and if the man prone to indignation be envious, <lb/>
            (we must explain) who each of these is, for thus it will be <lb/>
            evident whether what is said is true or false, e. g. if he is <lb/>
            envious who is grieved at the success of the good, but he is <lb/>
            prone to indignation who is grieved at the success of the bad, <lb/>
            it is clear that the envious will not be the indignant man. <lb/>
            We must also assume definitions, instead of the names in de­ <lb/>
            finitions, and not desist until we arrive at what is known ; <lb/>
            since often the question is not yet clear, when, indeed, the <lb/>
            whole definition has been given, but it becomes evident, <lb/>
            if the definition is given, instead of some name placed in the <lb/>
            definition.</p>
          <p>Moreover, the problem must be changed into a <lb/>
            proposition and then objected to, for the objec­ <lb/>
            tion* will be an argument against the thesis: <lb/>
            this place, indeed, is almost the same as seeing, <lb/>
            with what, either all or none, a thing is said to be <lb/>
            present, but it differs in the mode.1</p>
          <p>Further, we must define what kind of things <lb/>
            we ought, and what we ought not, to denominate <lb/>
            as the multitude do, for this is useful both for <lb/>
            confirmation and subversion, as that things are to <lb/>
            be called by the same names as the multitude use, <lb/>
            but that we are no longer to attend to the multi­ <lb/>
            tude, as to the quality of things, whether they be <lb/>
            such or such. For instance, that is to be called <lb/>
            salubrious, which is productive of health, as the <lb/>
            4th Top. To <lb/>
            change the <lb/>
            problem into a <lb/>
            proposition. <lb/>

            multitude say, but whether the thing proposed be productive <lb/>
            of health or not, is no longer to be decided by what the <lb/>
            multitude, but by what the physician declares. <note type="footnote"> I It is almost the same, because the objection is taken from the species <lb/>
            of the attribute or subject, as was explained in Anal. Prior ii. ch. 26 . <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>1st Topic. If <lb/>
            an ambiguity <lb/>
            of expression <lb/>
            escape our <lb/>
            opponent, we <lb/>
            must employ <lb/>
            the sense most <lb/>
            adapted to our <lb/>
            own position. <lb/>
            * Where there <lb/>
            is a latent <lb/>
            equivocation.</p>
          <p>MOREOVER, if a thing be multifariously predi­ <lb/>
            cated, but is laid down as inherent, or as non- <lb/>
            inherent, we must prove one of the things multi­ <lb/>
            fariously predicated, if we cannot prove both. <lb/>
            This must be used, however, in those things <lb/>
            which are latent,. for if what is multifariously <lb/>
            predicated is not latent, the opponent may object, <lb/>
            that what he is in doubt about, is not the subject <lb/>
            of dispute, but something else. This topic, indeed, converts <lb/>
            both for confirmation and subversion, for when we desire to <lb/>
            confirm we shall show that one is inherent, if we cannot <lb/>
            both; but when we subvert, we shall show that one is not <lb/>
            inherent, if we cannot both. Nevertheless, there is no need <lb/>
            for the subverter to dispute from compact, neither if a thing <lb/>
            be said to be present with every individual, nor if it be said <lb/>
            to be so with none, since if we show that it is not present <lb/>
            with any individual whatever, we shall have subverted its <lb/>
            being with every individual, likewise also if we should prove <lb/>
            it present with one, we shall have subverted its presence with <lb/>
            nothing. Still, in confirming, we must previously acknow­ <lb/>
            ledge, that if it is present with any whatever, it is present <lb/>
            with every thing, if the axiom be probable, since it is not <lb/>
            enough to discourse about one thing, in order to prove that <lb/>
            it is present with every thing, as if the soul of man is <lb/>
            + Bekker and <lb/>
            Waitz thus, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">διότι</foreign>. Buhle <lb/>
            and Taylor, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">καί ότί</foreign>. <lb/>
            immortal, that † every soul is immortal, where­ <lb/>
            fore, it must be previously taken for granted, that <lb/>
            if any soul whatever is immortal, every soul also <lb/>
            is immortal. This, however, is not always to be <lb/>
            done, but when we cannot supply one common reason in all, <lb/>
            as a geometrician (proves by one common reason, that a <lb/>
            triangle has angles equal to two right).</p>
          <p>2nd Top. If it <lb/>
            does not escape <lb/>
            him, we must <lb/>
            distinguish the <lb/>
            various senses <lb/>
            of predication. <lb/>
            (Cf. Top. vi. 2.)</p>
          <p>Yet if a thing is not latent, being predicated in <lb/>
            many ways, we must subvert and confirm, having <lb/>
            distinguished in how many ways it is predicated ; <lb/>
            thus, if the becoming is the advantageous or the <lb/>
            beautiful, we must try to confirm or subvert, both <lb/>
            about the proposed (problem), e. g. that it is beautiful and <pb n="389"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. III.]"/>advantageous, or that it is neither beautiful nor advantageous. <lb/>
            Still if we cannot prove both, we must prove one, of them, <lb/>
            showing that the one is, but the other not; but the reasoning <lb/>
            is the same, though there should be more mem­ <lb/>
            bers in the division.. <lb/>
            * i. e. than two.</p>
          <p>Again, (we must consider) those things which <lb/>
            are not equivocally predicated in many ways, but <lb/>
            in some other way, thus science is one of many, <lb/>
            either as belonging to the end, or to that which <lb/>
            pertains to the end, as medicine (is the science) <lb/>
            of producing health, and of prescribing diet, or as <lb/>
            belonging to both ends, as of contraries there is <lb/>
            3rd Top. Where <lb/>
            there is not <lb/>
            equivocation; <lb/>
            yet in all cases, <lb/>
            the different <lb/>
            relative and <lb/>
            actual senses, <lb/>
            have to be con­ <lb/>
            sidered. <lb/>
            said to be the same science, (since the one) is no more an <lb/>
            end than the other, or as belonging to that which is per se, <lb/>
            and to that which is accidental, as (we know) per se that a <lb/>
            triangle has angles equal to two right, but according to acci­ <lb/>
            dent, that it is equilateral, for because it happens to an equi­ <lb/>
            lateral triangle to be a triangle, according to this we know <lb/>
            that it has angles equal to two right. If then it is by no <lb/>
            means possible that there should be the same science of many <lb/>
            things, it is clearly altogether impossible, or if in a certain <lb/>
            respect it is possible, it is clear that it is possible. Never­ <lb/>
            theless, we must distinguish in how many ways it is useful; <lb/>
            for instance, if we desire to confirm we must introduce such <lb/>
            things as are possible, and we must divide them into those <lb/>
            only which are useful to confirmation ; but if we would sub­ <lb/>
            vert, (we must introduce) such things as are impossible, and <lb/>
            omit the rest. This too must be done in these, when it is <lb/>
            latent in how many ways they are predicated, that this also <lb/>
            belongs to that, or does not belong, must be confirmed from <lb/>
            the same places; as that this science is of this thing, either as <lb/>
            belonging to the end, or to those things which pertain to the <lb/>
            end, or as to those which are accidental, or on the other hand, <lb/>
            that a thing is not according to any of the above-mentioned <lb/>
            modes. The same reasoning also subsists about desire and <lb/>
            such other things as are said to belong to many, for desire <lb/>
            belongs to this thing either as to the end, as to health, or as <lb/>
            to those things which pertain to the end, as to the taking <lb/>
            medicine, or as to that which is from accident, as in wine, he <lb/>
            who loves sweetness (desires wine), not because it is wine, <lb/>
            but because it is sweet, since he desires sweetness per se, but <pb n="390"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK II."/>wine accidentally, since if it should be sour, he no longer de­ <lb/>
            sires it, therefore he desires it from accident. This place <lb/>
            however is useful in relatives, for almost all such things as <lb/>
            these, belong to relatives.</p>

          <p>1st Top. An in­ <lb/>
            telligible name <lb/>
            to be adopted <lb/>
            instead of an <lb/>
            obscure one.</p>
          <p>AGAIN, a change must be made into a name more <lb/>
            known, as, for instance, the clear instead of the <lb/>
            accurate in notion, and the love of employment <lb/>
            instead of being engaged in various occupations, <lb/>
            for the assertion being more known, the thesis is more easily <lb/>
            opposed. This place also is common to both confirmation <lb/>
            and subversion.</p>
          <p>2nd, To prove <lb/>
            the presence of <lb/>
            contraries, ge­ <lb/>
            nus must be <lb/>
            regarded.</p>
          <p>In order however to show that contraries are <lb/>
            present with the same thing, it is necessary to <lb/>
            attend to the genus; thus if we desire to prove <lb/>
            that there is rectitude and error about sense, <lb/>
            since sensibly to perceive, is to judge, but it is possible to <lb/>
            judge rightly and not rightly, about sense also, there will be <lb/>
            1. Demonstra­ <lb/>
            tion of species <lb/>
            from genus. <lb/>
            2. Vice versâ. <lb/>
            rectitude and error. Now, then, from the genus <lb/>
            the demonstration is concerning the species, since <lb/>
            to judge is the genus of sensible perception, for <lb/>
            he who sensibly perceives, in some way judges. <lb/>
            Again, from species to genus, for whatever things <lb/>
            are present with species are also with genus, as if science is <lb/>
            bad and good, disposition also is bad and good, for disposition <lb/>
            is the genus of science. The former place therefore is false <lb/>
            indeed for confirmation, but the latter is true, since it is <lb/>
            not necessary that whatever things are present with genus, <lb/>
            should also be present with species, since animal is winged <lb/>
            and quadruped, but man is not, yet whatever things are pre­ <lb/>
            sent with species, are necessarily also with genus, for if man is <lb/>
            good, animal also is good. Still for subversion, the former is <lb/>
            true, but the latter false, as whatever are not present with <lb/>
            genus, neither are with species, but it is unnecessary that <lb/>
            whatever are not with species, should not be present with <lb/>
            genus.</p>
          <p>Srd, Of what <lb/>
            genus is predi-</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding, since it is requisite that of <lb/>
            what things genus is predicated, some species also <pb n="391"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. IV.]"/>should be predicated, and whatever things possess <lb/>
            genus, or are paronymously denominated from <lb/>
            genus, have necessarily a certain species, or are <lb/>
            paronymously demonstrated from some species, as <lb/>
            cated, some <lb/>
            species will be, <lb/>
            and if no spe­ <lb/>
            cies if. no ge­ <lb/>

            it science is predicated of some certain thing, grammar also, or <lb/>
            music, or some other science, will be predicated (of it) ; and if <lb/>
            any one has science, or is paronymously denominated from <lb/>
            science, he will also possess grammar, or music, or some other <lb/>
            science, or will be paronymously called from some one of <lb/>
            them, as, for instance, a grammarian or musician ;-if then any <lb/>
            thing should be laid down which is in any way denominated <lb/>
            from genus, as that the soul is moved, we must consider whe­ <lb/>
            ther it is possible for the soul to be moved according to any <lb/>
            species of motion, as to be increased, or corrupted, or generated, <lb/>
            or such other species of motion. *1 For if by „ Cf. Cat. 14. <lb/>
            none (may it be moved), it is evident that it is <lb/>
            not moved: this place also pertains in common to both sub­ <lb/>
            Version and confirmation, for if it is moved according to any <lb/>
            species, it is evident that it is moved, and if according to no <lb/>
            species, it is evidently not moved.</p>
          <p>He however who is not well provided with <lb/>
            arguments about the thesis, must consider from <lb/>

          <p>SINCE contraries are united to each other in six <lb/>
            ways, but produce contrariety when united in four, <lb/>
            we must assume contraries in such a method as <lb/>
            may be useful, both to the subverter and con­ <lb/>
            structor. Now that they are involved six ways <lb/>
            is clear, for either each will be connected with <lb/>
            each of the contraries, and this in a twofold re­ <lb/>
            srect, as to act well by friends and ill by enemies, <lb/>
            or, on the contrary, to act ill by friends and well by <lb/>

            deed, produce contrariety, since to act well by <lb/>
            friends is not contrary to acting ill by enemies, as <lb/>
            both are eligible t and proceed from the same <lb/>
            character.‡1 Nor is the injuring friends contrary <lb/>
            to the benefiting enemies, for both these are to be <lb/>
            avoided and proceed from the same character, but what is to <lb/>
            be avoided does not seem contrary to what is to be avoided, <lb/>
            unless the one is spoken according to excess, but the other <lb/>
            according to defect, for excess appears to be of the number of <lb/>
            2. All the re­ <lb/>

            do produce <lb/>

            All the remaining four, however, produce con­ <lb/>

            the consequence of these also is direct, since the eligible is <lb/>
            contrary to what is to be avoided, and similarly in other <lb/>
            things. But the consequence is inverse, as health indeed <lb/>
            follows a good habit of body, but disease does not, a bad habit, <lb/>
            but a bad habit of body is consequent to disease, wherefore it <lb/>
            is clear that the consequence in these, is inverse. Neverthe­ <lb/>

            simply.</p>
          <p>Again, it a thing is said to be more and less, it <lb/>
            is likewise simply, for what is not good nor white, <lb/>
            will neither be said to be more or less good or <lb/>
            white, for evil is not more or less good, than any <lb/>

            Yet neither does this place convert for the purpose of sub­ <lb/>
            version, since many things which are not said to be more, sub­ <lb/>

          <p>In the same manner we must pay attention to <lb/>
            that which subsists according to something, and <lb/>
            at some time, and in some place; for if it is pos­ <lb/>
            sible as to something, it is also simply possible, <lb/>
            and in like manner the when or the where, <lb/>
            for what is simply impossible, is neither possible as to any <lb/>
            thing, nor any where, nor at any time. It is objected (per­ <lb/>
            haps) that worthy men are naturally (so), as to a certain <lb/>
            thing, for instance, liberal or temperate, but simply they are <lb/>
            not naturally worthy. Likewise it is possible at some time <lb/>
            that something corruptible may not be corrupted, but simply <lb/>
            it is impossible that it should not be corrupted: in the same <lb/>
            way also it is beneficial to use a certain kind of diet some <lb/>
            where, for instance, in unhealthy places, but simply it is not <lb/>
            beneficial. Moreover, in a certain place, it is possible for one <lb/>
            only to be, but simply it is not possible that one only should <lb/>
            + Cf. Pliny and <lb/>
            Herod. iv. 49. <lb/>
            be ; in the same way also at a certain place, it was <lb/>
            good to sacrifice a father, e. g. among the Tribali,† <lb/>
            but simply it is not good. Now does not this in­ <lb/>
            deed signify not a certain place, but to certain people ? for it <lb/>
            makes no difference where they may be, since every where it <lb/>
            will be a noble action with them, (as) Tribali. Again, at <lb/>
            some time it is beneficial to take medicine, as when a man is <lb/>
            ill, but simply it is not (beneficial), may we not say that nei­ <lb/>
            ther does this signify a certain time, but refers to one dis­ <lb/>
            ‡ i.e. who is ill. <lb/>

            the contrary, you will say that to reverence the gods is good <lb/>
            without any addition, for it is simply good ; hence that which <lb/>
            without any addition appears to be good, or base, or any <lb/>
            thing else of the kind, will be said (to be so) simply.</p>

            this is first to be determined, that we do not make <lb/>
            those the subjects of consideration, which are very <lb/>
            remote and greatly differ from each other, (since <lb/>

            eligible is <lb/>
            either- <lb/>

            entertain a doubt, to whether of them, " more " should be added, <lb/>
            because we see no superiority of one to the other. Now in <lb/>
            these it is clear, that one or more excellencies being shown, <lb/>
            the reasoning faculty will grant, that this is more eligible <lb/>

          <p>First, then, that which is longer in duration or <lb/>
            is more certain, is more eligible, than that which <lb/>
            is less such;1 and that which a wise or good man <lb/>

            thing else, as to be well, is preferable to being <lb/>

            they may not injure us. This, however, is the same with <lb/>
            what is prior to it, but it differs in the mode,1 as we desire <lb/>
            our friends, to be just, for their own sake, even if nothing <lb/>

            The cause also, per se, of good, is preferable to <lb/>

            kind. It will be the same, too, in the contrary <lb/>
            (to the eligible), for what is per se, the cause of <lb/>

            one are per se amongst things honourable and <lb/>

            for itself, but for something else, but friendship for itself, <lb/>

          <p>I. We must <lb/>
            judge of the <lb/>
            excellence of <lb/>
            things by their <lb/>
            consequents, <lb/>
            positively and <lb/>
            negatively­ <lb/>
            this investiga­ <lb/>
            tion two-fold.</p>
          <p>MOREOVER, when two things are very like each <lb/>
            other, and we cannot perceive any superiority of <lb/>
            the one to the other, we must investigate from the <lb/>
            consequents, for whichever the greater good fol­ <lb/>
            lows, is the preferable. Still, if the consequents <lb/>
            be evil, that which the less evil follows is prefer­ <lb/>
            able, for both being eligible, there is nothing to prevent <lb/>
            something troublesome resulting. The investigation indeed <lb/>
            from the consequent is two-fold, since it follows both prior <lb/>
            and posterior, as to the learner ignorance is prior, but know­ <lb/>
            ledge posterior; for the most part however the latter conse­ <lb/>
            quent is better, so that we must take whichever consequent <lb/>
            may be useful.</p>
          <p>2. More goods <lb/>
            preferable to <lb/>
            fewer; an ob­ <lb/>
            jection.</p>
          <p>Again, many goods (are to be preferred) to <lb/>
            fewer, either simply, or when some are inherent in <lb/>
            others, viz. the fewer in the more: it is objected <lb/>
            if anywhere one thing is for the sake of another, <lb/>
            for both are not at all preferable to the one ; thus, to be made <lb/>
            well and health are not preferable to health, as we choose to <lb/>
            be made well on account of health, still there is nothing to pre­ <lb/>
            vent things which are not good, conjoined with such as are <lb/>
            good, from being more eligible, as felicity and something else, <lb/>
            which is not good, than justice and fortitude, and the same <lb/>
            things with pleasure, rather than without pleasure, and the <lb/>
            same things with painlessness than with pain.</p>
          <p>3. A thing at <lb/>
            its acme of po­ <lb/>
            tentiality, more <lb/>
            eligible.</p>
          <p>Besides, each thing at the time of its greatest <lb/>
            power is more eligible, as to be without pain in <lb/>
            old age rather than in youth, for it is capable of <note type="footnote"> 1 In the Ethics, b. viii. ch. I, he makes friendship, supersede justice. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Compare Juvenal, Sat. x. 188, et seq.; 2 Samuel xix. 35. </note> <pb n="409"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. II.]"/>effecting more in old age. So also prudence in old age is <lb/>
            preferable, because no one chooses the young as leaders from <lb/>
            not deeming them prudent. Courage indeed is contrary, for <lb/>
            courageous energy is more necessary in youth; so also tem­ <lb/>
            perance, for the young are more burdened by desires than <lb/>
            elderly men.</p>
          <p>Whatever also is useful at every time or at most <lb/>
            times, is more useful, thus justice and temperance <lb/>
            than courage, for the former are always, but the <lb/>
            latter is sometimes useful. Again, that which all <lb/>
            men possessing we require nothing else, (is more <lb/>
            eligible) than that which (all) possessing we <lb/>
            4. Whatever is <lb/>
            useful at all, or <lb/>
            at most, times. <lb/>
            5. What is suf­ <lb/>
            ficient of itself, <lb/>
            when all pos­ <lb/>
            sess it. <lb/>
            should require something else beside, as in the case of jus­ <lb/>
            tice and courage, for if all men were just, courage would not <lb/>
            at all be useful, but though all men were courageous, justice <lb/>
            would be useful.</p>
          <p>Further, (we can derive arguments from cor­ <lb/>
            ruptions and rejections, generations, assumptions, <lb/>
            and contraries, for those, the corruptions of which <lb/>
            are more to be avoided, are themselves more <lb/>

            tions, etc., and <lb/>
            their contra­ <lb/>
            ries. <lb/>
            eligible. Likewise with rejections and contraries, for whe­ <lb/>
            ther the rejection or the contrary is more to be avoided, it is <lb/>
            itself more eligible. Still in generations and assumptions the <lb/>
            contrary occurs, and those are more eligible whose assump­ <lb/>
            tions and generations are so.</p>
          <p>Another place is, that the nearer to the good is <lb/>
            better and preferable, also the more similar to the <lb/>
            good, as justice than a just man. Likewise what <lb/>
            is more similar to the better than itself, as some <lb/>
            7. The nearer <lb/>
            and more simi­ <lb/>
            lar to the good, <lb/>
            etc.: an objec­ <lb/>
            tion stated. <lb/>
            say that Ajax was better than Ulysses, because he was more <lb/>
            similar to Achilles. The objection to this is that it is not <lb/>
            true, since nothing prevents Ajax from being more similar <lb/>
            to Achilles, not so far as Achilles was the best; the other <lb/>
            (IDysses) being indeed good, yet not similar. We <lb/>
            must also see whether the similar exists in things <lb/>
            more ridiculous, as an ape is like a man, when a <lb/>
            horse is not so, since the ape is not more beauti­ <lb/>
            ful, but more similar to man. Again, in two <lb/>
            things, if one more resembles the better, but the <lb/>
            other the worse, that will be the better which <lb/>
            more resembles the better, Yet this also has an <lb/>
            8. Ascertain <lb/>
            whether the <lb/>
            similar exists <lb/>
            in the more <lb/>
            ridiculous. <lb/>
            9. Compare re­ <lb/>
            lative excel­ <lb/>
            lence of the ob­ <lb/>
            ject resembled-. <lb/>
            objection. <pb n="410"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK III."/>objection, since there is nothing to prevent the one being in a <lb/>
            small degree similar to the better, but the other being very <lb/>
            similar to the worse. As if Ajax was a little like Achilles, <lb/>
            10. If the re­ <lb/>
            semblance to <lb/>
            the better, be <lb/>
            in something <lb/>
            inferior. <lb/>
            but Ulysses excessively like Nestor. Also if <lb/>
            what resembles the better is like so far as pertains <lb/>
            to the worse, but what resembles the worse so <lb/>
            far as belongs to the better, as a horse with re­ <lb/>
            spect to an ass, and an ape to a man.</p>
          <p>11. The more <lb/>
            illustrious. <lb/>
            12. The more <lb/>
            difficult. <lb/>
            13. The less <lb/>
            common. <lb/>
            14. The less <lb/>
            connected with <lb/>
            evil.</p>
          <p>Another, the more illustrious, (is preferable) to <lb/>
            that which is less so,1 likewise the more difficult, <lb/>
            for the possession of those things is dearer to us <lb/>
            which cannot easily be obtained. Again, the <lb/>
            more peculiar than the more common.2 Also that <lb/>
            which has less connexion with evils, for that is <lb/>
            preferable which no molestation follows, rather <lb/>
            than that which it does follow.</p>
          <p>15. The best <lb/>
            in the simply <lb/>
            better. <lb/>
            * See the say­ <lb/>
            ing of Cyrus. <lb/>
            Cyropæd. viii. <lb/>
            2.</p>
          <p>Again, if this is simply better than that, that <lb/>
            which is the best in this, is better than that which <lb/>
            is the best in the other, as, if man is better than <lb/>
            horse, the best man also is better than the best <lb/>
            horse,* and if the best is better than the best, <lb/>
            this also is simply better than that, thus, if the <lb/>
            best man is better than the best horse, man also simply is <lb/>
            better than horse.</p>

            17. What we <lb/>
            would rather <lb/>
            do for friends.</p>
          <p>Further, those things of which our friends can <lb/>
            share are preferable3 to what they cannot partake <lb/>
            of: also those which we would rather do for a <lb/>
            friend, are preferable to what we would do for any <lb/>
            one, as, to act justly and to do good are preferable <lb/>
            to seeming (to do so, for we rather desire to benefit our <lb/>
            friends than to seem (to benefit them), but contrarily with <lb/>

          <p>Also those which are from abundance are bet­ <lb/>
            ter than such as are necessary, and sometimes <lb/>
            indeed are more eligible, for to live well, is better <lb/>
            than to live merely,1 but to live well is from the <lb/>

            from abund­ <lb/>
            ance : an ex­ <lb/>
            ception stated. <lb/>
            abundant, and to live itself, is necessary. Sometimes how­ <lb/>
            ever things which are better are not also more eligible, for if <lb/>
            they are better, it is not necessary that they should be more <lb/>
            eligible, for instance, to philosophize is better than to get <lb/>
            money, yet it is not more eligible to one in want of necessaries. <lb/>
            Still it is from abundance, when necessaries being (supplied), <lb/>
            a person procures certain other things good; yet perhaps the <lb/>
            necessary is almost preferable, but that from abundance is <lb/>
            better.</p>
          <p>Again, that which cannot be supplied by an­ <lb/>
            other is better than what another may supply, as <lb/>

            power is not eligible without prudence, but prudence is eligi­ <lb/>
            ble without power. Also it we deny one of two, <lb/>
            that the other may seem to be present with us, <lb/>
            that is the more eligible which we desire to seem <lb/>

            that which has it in a greater degree. Further, <lb/>
            if one thing causes that to be good with which it <lb/>
            is present, but another does not, the efficient is <lb/>
            preferable, as what heats is hotter than what does <lb/>
            not, yet if both cause it, that which causes it the <lb/>
            more, or that which renders the better and more principal <lb/>

          <p>Again, from cases, uses, actions, and works, <lb/>
            and these from those,1 for they follow each other ; <lb/>
            for example, if justly is preferable to courage­ <lb/>
            ously, justice also is preferable to courage, an. if <lb/>
            justice is preferable to courage, justly also is preferable to <lb/>
            courageously, and similarly in other things.</p>
          <p>4. The greater <lb/>
            good of the <lb/>
            same. <lb/>

            5. The one of <lb/>
            two most to be <lb/>
            preferred in re­ <lb/>
            ference to a <lb/>
            third. <lb/>
            6. Where ex­ <lb/>
            cess is prefer­ <lb/>
            able. <lb/>
            7. What a man <lb/>
            prefers to ob­ <lb/>
            tain by him­ <lb/>
            self.</p>
          <p>Besides, if of the same thing one is the greater <lb/>
            good, but the other the less, the greater is pre­ <lb/>
            ferable, or - if it is the good of the greater, it is <lb/>
            the greater (good).2 But also if two things are <lb/>
            preferable to a certain thing, the more eligible is <lb/>
            to be preferred to the less eligible. Again, that <lb/>
            of which the excess is more eligible than the ex­ <lb/>
            cess (of another thing), is itself more eligible, as <lb/>
            friendship than wealth, for the excess of friend­ <lb/>
            ship is preferable to the excess of wealth. Also <lb/>
            that which a man would rather procure through <lb/>
            himself, than which (he procures) through another, <lb/>
            e. g. friends than money.</p>
          <p>8. We must <lb/>
            judge from <lb/>

            ‡ These words <lb/>
            omitted by <lb/>
            Taylor.</p>
          <p>Again, also from addition, if any thing being <lb/>
            added to the same, renders the whole more eligi­ <lb/>
            ble: we must be careful, however, lest we pro­ <lb/>
            pose such things, in which what is common is <lb/>
            employed in one of the things added, or is in <lb/>
            some other† way co-operative with it, but the <lb/>
            rest is not used nor is co-operative; ‡ for example, <lb/>
            a saw and a sickle (being joined) by constructive <lb/>
            art, the saw when conjoined is more eligible, but <note type="footnote"> I Cases, uses, actions, works, are to be judged from those of which they <lb/>
            are the cases, etc. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Health, the good of the body, is therefore inferior to science, the <lb/>
            good of the mind </note> <pb n="413"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. III.]"/>simply is not so. Again, if any thing being added to the less <lb/>
            renders the whole greater. Likewise also from <lb/>
            detraction, for when any thing being taken away <lb/>
            from the same, the remainder is less, that which <lb/>
            9. Also from <lb/>
            detraction. <lb/>
            was taken away) will be greater, since what is removed <lb/>
            renders the remainder less.</p>
          <p>Also, if one is eligible for itself, but the other <lb/>
            on account of estimation, as health than beauty. <lb/>
            Now, the definition of what is eligible on the score <lb/>
            of estimation, is that if no one were conscious, we <lb/>
            should not endeavour to obtain it.1 And if one <lb/>
            thing is eligible for its own sake, and on account <lb/>
            of estimation, but the other on account of one of <lb/>
            them only. And that which is more honourable <lb/>
            for its own sake is better and more eligible, but <lb/>
            that would be more honourable per se, which, no­ <lb/>
            thing else being about to result, we rather prefer <lb/>
            for its own sake. <lb/>
            tO. Also if one <lb/>
            is eligible per <lb/>
            Be, but the <lb/>
            other on ac­ <lb/>
            count of es­ <lb/>
            timation ; de­ <lb/>
            finition of the <lb/>
            latter. <lb/>
            11. If one be <lb/>
            for both, but <lb/>
            the other for <lb/>
            one only. <lb/>
            12. What is <lb/>
            more honour­ <lb/>
            able for its own <lb/>
            sake.</p>
          <p>Moreover, we must distinguish in how many <lb/>
            ways the eligible is predicated, and for the sake <lb/>
            of what things, as for that of the profitable, or <lb/>
            the beautiful, or the pleasant, for whatever is <lb/>
            useful to all or to the greater number, would be <lb/>
            13. Notice in <lb/>
            how many <lb/>
            ways the eligi­ <lb/>
            ble is predi­ <lb/>
            cated, “et quo­ <lb/>
            rum gratiâ.” <lb/>
            more eligible than that which is not similarly (so useful). <lb/>
            When, however, the same are present to both, we must con­ <lb/>
            sider with which they are more present, whether it be the <lb/>
            more pleasant, or the more beautiful, or the more profitable. <lb/>
            Again, what is for the sake of the better, is more eligible, as <lb/>
            what is for the sake of virtue than what is for the sake of <lb/>
            pleasure. It is the same also in things to be avoided, for that <lb/>
            is more to be avoided which is more an impediment to the <lb/>
            eligible, as disease than deformity, since disease is a greater <lb/>
            impediment both to pleasure and probity.</p>
          <p>Once more, from similarly demonstrating,* that <lb/>
            the thing proposed is to be avoided and chosen, <lb/>
            for a thing of such a kind as that one may simi­ <lb/>
            larly choose and avoid it, is less eligible than an­ <lb/>
            other thing which is eligible only.</p>
          <p>* i. e. another <lb/>
            place is deriv­ <lb/>
            able. <lb/>
            14. What is de­ <lb/>
            sired is more <lb/>
            eligible than <lb/>
            what is in­ <lb/>
            different. <note type="footnote"> 1 For the test of real religious character in this respect, see Matt. VI. </note></p><pb n="414"/>

            requisite to take away the excellence by which <lb/>
            one thing surpasses another. For if the more <lb/>
            honourable is more eligible, the honourable also <lb/>
            is eligible, and if what is more useful is more <lb/>
            eligible, the useful also is eligible, it is the same <lb/>
            also in other things which have such a comparison, Still in <lb/>
            some, by making a comparison of one with the other, we pro­ <lb/>
            nounce directly, that either, or that one of them, is eligible, <lb/>
            as when we say, that one thing is naturally, but another <lb/>

          <p>PLACES pre-eminently universal are to be as­ <lb/>

            thus assumed they will be useful for more (pro­ <lb/>

            have mentioned, more universal by changing the <lb/>
            appellation in a slight degree; thus, what is such <lb/>
            by nature, is more such than what is not such by <lb/>
            nature. Also, if the one causes, but the other <lb/>
            does not cause, the thing which possesses that to be such, (or <lb/>
            that) in which it is inherent; what is sometimes the cause, <lb/>
            is more a thing of this kind than what is not the cause, but <lb/>

            of this kind. Moreover, trom addition (we may <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. VI.]"/>the same, renders the whole more such, or if what is <lb/>

            being taken away, the remainder is less such, is <lb/>
            itself more such. Also things which are more <lb/>

            and not universally, all the above-mentioned uni­ <lb/>
            versal places confirmatory or subversive are useful. <lb/>
            For when we subvert or confirm universally, we <lb/>
            also demonstrate particularly, since if a thing is <lb/>
            present with every, it is also present with a cer­ <lb/>
            tain one, and if with none, neither is it with any <lb/>
            one. Notwithstanding, those places are above all <lb/>

            how the above <lb/>
            places in this, <lb/>

            Places from <lb/>

            especially suit <lb/>
            able. <lb/>
            opportune and common, which are assumed from opposites, co- <lb/>
            ordinates, and cases, for it is similarly probable to assume, if <lb/>
            every pleasure is good, that all pain likewise is an evil, and if <lb/>
            a certain pleasure is good, that a certain pain also is an evil. <lb/>
            Yet more, if a certain sense is not a power, a certain privation <lb/>
            of sense also is not impotence, and if a certain thing being the <lb/>
            subject of opinion is also that of science, a certain opinion also <lb/>
            is science. Again, if any thing. unjust is good, something <lb/>
            just also is evil, and if any thing done justly is an evil, some­ <lb/>
            thing done unjustly is good.. Also, if something <lb/>

            ation be among evil things, a certain science will be amongst <lb/>
            things evil, for instance, if to forget the base acts a person <lb/>
            has committed, is among things good, or to remember them, is <lb/>
            amongst things evil, to know the base acts which any one <lb/>

          <p>Moreover, (there is a place) from the more, and <lb/>

            of those from another genus is more such, but no <lb/>
            one of those is such, neither will what was men­ <lb/>

            ther will pleasure be. And in the same way from the simi­ <lb/>
            larly and the less, for both to subvert and to confirm, will be <lb/>
            possible, except (that we may do) both from the similarly, but <lb/>
            from the less, only confirm, and not subvert. For if a certain <lb/>
            power is similarly good, and science, but a certain power is <lb/>
            good, a certain science also is, but if no power, neither is <lb/>
            science; still, if a certain power is less a good than science, <lb/>
            but a certain power is good, science also is. On the other <lb/>
            hand, if no power is good, it is not necessary also that no <lb/>
            science should be good, wherefore we can evidently only con­ <lb/>
            firm, from the less.</p>
          <p>3. That we may <lb/>
            subvert not <lb/>
            only from an­ <lb/>
            other, but from <lb/>
            the same ge­ <lb/>
            nus.</p>
          <p>t The same <lb/>
            thing is done. <lb/>
            4. Case of hy­ <lb/>
            pothesis.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding, we may not only subvert from <lb/>
            another genus, but also from the same, by as­ <lb/>
            suming what is especially such ;.as if it is admitted <lb/>
            that a certain science is good, but it should be <lb/>
            shown that prudence is not good, neither will any <lb/>
            other be, since what especially seems (good) is <lb/>
            not (so). Once more, from hypothesis,t when in <lb/>
            the same way it is assumed, that if a thing is pre­ <lb/>
            sent or not, with one, it is also or not, with all, as <lb/>
            if the soul of man is immortal, that other (souls) also are. but <lb/>
            if this is not, that neither are the others. If indeed then a <lb/>
            thing is assumed present with a certain one, it must be proved <lb/>
            not present with a certain one, since it will follow through <lb/>
            the hypothesis that it is present with nothing, but if it is <lb/>
            laid down not present with any, we must show that it is pre­ <lb/>
            sent with some one, for thus it will follow that it is present <lb/>
            with all. Indeed it is evident that he who makes this hypo­ <pb n="417"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. VI.]"/>thesis, makes the problem universal, which was laid down as <lb/>
            particular, for he requires that to be acknowledged universal, <lb/>
            which was allowed to be particular, since if it is present with <lb/>
            one, he assumes it similarly present with all.</p>
          <p>The problem then being indefinite, it is possi­ <lb/>
            ble to subvert it in one way, as if a person said <lb/>
            that pleasure is good or not good, and added <lb/>
            nothing else in the definition. For if he said that <lb/>
            5. The indefi­ <lb/>
            nite can be sub­ <lb/>
            verted in one <lb/>
            way only. <lb/>
            a certain pleasure is good, we must show universally that no <lb/>
            pleasure is, if the proposition is to be subverted. In like <lb/>
            manner, also, if he said that a certain pleasure is not good, we <lb/>
            must show universally that all is, for otherwise subversion is <lb/>
            impossible; since if we have shown that a certain pleasure is <lb/>
            not good, or that it is good, the proposition is not yet sub­ <lb/>
            verted. It is evident then, that subversion is <lb/>
            possible in one way, but confirmation in two for <lb/>
            both whether we show universally that all mea- <lb/>
            6. Confirmation <lb/>
            possible in two <lb/>
            ways. <lb/>
            sure is good, or that a certain pleasure is good, the proposition <lb/>
            will have been proved. Likewise if it should be required to <lb/>
            be argued that a certain pleasure is not good, if we have <lb/>
            proved that no pleasure is good, or that a certain one is not <lb/>
            good, we shall have argued in both ways, both universally <lb/>
            and particularly, that a certain pleasure is not <lb/>
            good. The thesis indeed being defined, it will <lb/>
            be possible to subvert in two ways, as if it should <lb/>
            be laid down that good is present with a cer- <lb/>
            7. When the <lb/>
            thesis is defi­ <lb/>
            nite, we may <lb/>
            subvert in two <lb/>
            ways. <lb/>
            tain pleasure, but with a certain (pleasure) is not present, <lb/>
            since whether all pleasure, or no pleasure, be proved good, the <lb/>
            proposition will be subverted. Still, if it has been <lb/>
            admitted that one pleasure only is good, subversion <lb/>
            2. Or in three. <lb/>
            is possible in three ways, for by showing that all, or that none, <lb/>
            or that more (pleasures) than one, are good, we shall have <lb/>
            subverted the proposition. Nevertheless, the thesis having <lb/>
            been defined to a greater extent, as that prudence alone of <lb/>
            the virtues is a science, subversion is possible in <lb/>
            four ways, for it having been shown that every <lb/>
            3. Or in four. <lb/>
            virtue is science, or that none, or that some other (is a sci­ <lb/>
            ence), as justice, or that prudence itself is not a science, the <lb/>
            proposition will have been subverted.</p>
          <p>It is also useful to attend to singulars, in which <lb/>
            something was said to be inherent or not, as in <lb/>
            8. Singulars to <lb/>
            be attended to, <lb/>
            as to things in- <note type="footnote">2 E</note> <pb n="418"/>

            genera. <lb/>
            universal problems. Again, we must look to <lb/>
            genera dividing according to species, as far as to <lb/>
            individuals, as we observed before, tor whether a thing ap­ <lb/>
            pears present with every, or with none, (the opponent) must <lb/>

            to acknowledge * universally, or to bring an ob­ <lb/>
            jection, in what thing it is not so. Besides, in what <lb/>
            things it is possible to define accident, whether in <lb/>
            species or in number, it must be considered, if <lb/>
            no one of these is present, as t that time is not <lb/>
            moved, and that neither is it motion, having <lb/>
            how many species of motion there are, since if <lb/>
            these is present with time, it is evidently not <lb/>
            moved, neither is it motion.‡1 Likewise also, (if <lb/>
            we wish to show) that the soul is not number, (we <lb/>
            must prove) by division, every number is either <lb/>
            odd or even, as, if the soul is neither odd nor even, <lb/>
            it is clearly not number. §2</p>
          <p>For accident then we must argue through such (places) as <lb/>
            these, and in such a manner. <note type="footnote"> I It would exceed our limits to give a satisfactory digest, of the com­ <lb/>
            mentary of Simplicius, upon the question of the affinity of time to mo­ <lb/>

            to the no less careful exposition by Taylor, of the Aristotelian philo­ <lb/>
            sophy. The places in the Metaph. and Phys. bearing on the point, are <lb/>
            alluded to: meanwhile I may remark, that in the opinion of Aristotle, <lb/>
            time is not motion, unless so far as motion has number; an indication of <lb/>
            which is, that we "judge of the more and the less, by number, but of a <lb/>
            greater and less motion, by time. Since, again, number is two-fold, (for <lb/>
            we call both the numbered, and that which is numerable, number, and <lb/>
            also that by which we number,) time is that which is numbered, and not <lb/>

          <p>OUR attention must now be directed to what ap­ <lb/>
            pertains to genus, and property, and these are the <lb/>
            elements of such as belong to definitions, but <lb/>
            about them there is seldom a consideration by <lb/>
            disputants. If then it should be laid down that <lb/>
            there is a genus of any certain thing, we must <lb/>
            first have respect to all things allied to what <lb/>
            Ist Top. Genus <lb/>
            deceptively as­ <lb/>
            sumed, if it ap­ <lb/>
            plies not to <lb/>
            every thing, in <lb/>
            the same spe­ <lb/>
            cies with that, <lb/>
            of which it is <lb/>
            predicated. <lb/>
            is spoken,1 whether it is not predicated of something, as is <lb/>
            the case with accident, as if good is assumed as the genus of <lb/>
            pleasure, (we must see) whether a certain pleasure is not <lb/>
            good; for if this happens, it is clear that good is not the <lb/>
            genus of pleasure, since genus is predicated of all things under <lb/>
            the same species.* Next, whether it is not pre­ <lb/>
            dicated in answer to the question, what a thing <lb/>
            is; but as accident, as whiteness, of snow, or <lb/>
            what is moved by itself, of the soul; for neither <lb/>
            is snow, the same thing as whiteness, wherefore <lb/>
            * So Waltz and <lb/>
            Bekker. “Of <lb/>
            all the species <lb/>
            contained un­ <lb/>
            der it" (<foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰὸω̃ν</foreign>), <lb/>
            Taylor and <lb/>
            Buhle. <lb/>
            whiteness, is not the genus of snow, nor is the soul, the same <lb/>
            as what is moved, but it is accidental to it, to be moved, as <lb/>
            also it frequently happens to an animal, to walk and to be <lb/>
            walking. Moreover, the being moved, is not a certain thing, <lb/>
            but appears to signify something active, or passive ; likewise <lb/>
            also whiteness, for it does not discover what snow is, but <lb/>
            what kind of thing it is; hence neither of these, is predicated <lb/>
            in reply to the question what a thing is.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding, we must especially have re­ <lb/>
            gard to the definition of accident, if it concurs with <lb/>
            the stated genus, as also in what has just now <lb/>
            been mentioned, for the same thing may possibly <lb/>

            move, and not move itself, likewise also may be white, and <lb/>
            not white, so that neither of these is genus, but accident, <lb/>
            since we denominate that accident, which possibly may, and <lb/>
            may not be present, with a certain thing. <note type="footnote"> I h. e. ow <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀποδέδοται τὸ</foreign> <unclear>γένοι</unclear>, Waitz, </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 a a. </note></p><pb n="420"/>

          <p>3rd. Also whe­ <lb/>
            ther the genus <lb/>
            and the species <lb/>
            are in the same <lb/>
            category.</p>
          <p>Farther, whether the genus and the species, be <lb/>
            not in the same division, but the one, essence, and <lb/>
            the other, quality, or the one, relative, but the other, <lb/>
            quality, for instance, snow is essence, also a swan, <lb/>
            yet whiteness is not essence, but quality, so that whiteness is <lb/>
            neither the genus of snow, nor of a swan. Again, science is <lb/>
            of the number of relatives, but good, and beautiful, are each a <lb/>
            quality, hence neither the good, nor the beautiful, is the genus <lb/>
            of science, since the genera of relatives, must necessarily <lb/>
            themselves also, be relatives, as in the instance of the double, <lb/>
            for the multiple being the genus of the double, is itself of the <lb/>
            number of relatives. To speak universally, genus must be <lb/>
            under the same division with species, for if the species be <lb/>
            essence, the genus also is, and if the species be a quality, the <lb/>
            genus also is some quality, as if whiteness is a certain quality <lb/>
            so also is colour, and likewise in other cases.</p>
          <p>4th. Whether <lb/>
            the definition <lb/>
            of species is <lb/>
            predicated of <lb/>
            genus.</p>
          <p>Further, (we must examine) whether it is ne­ <lb/>
            cessary or contingent that genus partake of that <lb/>
            which was laid down in genus, and the definition <lb/>
            of partaking, is to receive the definition of what <lb/>
            is participated. Now it is evident that species partake of <lb/>
            genera, but not genera of species, since the species accepts the <lb/>
            definition of genus, but not genus that of the species. Where­ <lb/>
            fore we must observe, whether the proposed genus partakes, or <lb/>
            can partake, of species, as if some one should declare that there <lb/>
            is a certain genus of " being," or of " the one," for the genus <lb/>
            will happen to partake of the species, since "being" and "the <lb/>
            one if are predicated of all entities, so that their definition is <lb/>
            (predicated) also.</p>
          <p>5th. If the ge­ <lb/>
            nus is not pre­ <lb/>
            dicated of what <lb/>
            the species is.</p>
          <p>Besides, whether the assigned species is truly <lb/>
            predicated of a certain thing, but not the genus, <lb/>
            as if " being" or the object of science is laid down <lb/>
            as the eenus of what is the object of opinion, for <lb/>
            the object of opinion will be predicated of non-entity, since <lb/>
            many non-entities are the objects of opinion. Still that <lb/>
            being, or the object of science, is not predicated of non­ <lb/>
            entity, is evident, wherefore neither "being" nor the ob­ <lb/>
            ject of science, is the genus of the object of opinion, as of <lb/>
            what species is predicated, genus must also of necessity be <lb/>
            predicated.</p><pb n="421"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. I.]"/>
          <p>Again, whether what is placed in the genus <lb/>
            can possibly partake of no species, since it is im­ <lb/>
            possible that what partakes of no species, should <lb/>
            partake of genus, unless it should be one of those <lb/>
            6th. If what is <lb/>
            contained in <lb/>
            the genus is <lb/>
            subject to no <lb/>
            species. <lb/>
            species according to the first division, for these alone partake <lb/>
            of genus. If, then, motion be assumed as the genus of plea­ <lb/>
            sure, we must see whether pleasure be not pro­ <lb/>
            duction,* nor alteration, nor any one of the other <lb/>
            assigned motions,1 for it is palpable, that it par­ <lb/>
            takes of no species, wherefore neither of the <lb/>
            genus, since it is necessary that the participant <lb/>
            of the genus, should also be participant of some <lb/>
            * Taylor and <lb/>
            Buhle read <lb/>
            " corruption.” <lb/>
            Cf. Rhetoric i. <lb/>
            6 and 11; and <lb/>
            Eth. x. ch. 1, <lb/>
            et seq. <lb/>
            species, so that pleasure can neither be a species of motion, <lb/>
            nor an individual, (neither among those which are under a <lb/>
            species of motion). For individuals partake, also, of genus <lb/>
            and species, as a certain man, participates both of man, and of <lb/>
            animal.</p>
          <p>Besides, whether what is placed in genus, is of <lb/>
            wider extension than the genus, as the subject of <lb/>
            opinion, than entity, since both entity, and non­ <lb/>
            entity, are objects of opinion, wherefore, the ob­ <lb/>
            ject of opinion, will not be a species of entity, <lb/>
            as the genus is always more widely extended <lb/>
            than the species. Again, whether the species and <lb/>
            7th. If what is <lb/>
            placed in <lb/>
            genus is of <lb/>
            wider exten­ <lb/>
            sion than, or <lb/>
            equal to, the <lb/>
            genus itself. <lb/>

            " the one;” for "being," and "the one," (are consequent) to <lb/>
            every thing, so that neither is the genus of the other, since <lb/>
            they are predicated of an equal number. Likewise also, if <lb/>

            the principal is what is first, and what is first is principal, <lb/>

            same thing.</p>
          <p>CONSIDER, also, whether there is any other genus <lb/>
            of the assigned species, which neither compre­ <lb/>
            hends the assigned genus, nor is under it, as if <lb/>
            some one should assert science to be the genus of <lb/>
            justice, since virtue also is genus, and neither of these genera <lb/>
            comprehends the other, so that science would not be the <lb/>
            genus of justice, for apparently, when one species is under <lb/>
            two genera, one is comprehended under the other. This, <lb/>
            nevertheless, is doubtful in some cases, for to some, prudence <lb/>
            seems both virtue and science, and neither of the genera to <lb/>
            be comprehended under the other, yet it is not admitted by <lb/>
            all, that prudence is science; if, then, any one admitted the <lb/>
            statement to be true, yet it will appear necessary that genera <lb/>
            of the same thing, should be either subaltern, or both under <lb/>
            the same genus,2 just as it happens in virtue and science, for <lb/>
            both are under the same genus, since each of them is habit <lb/>
            and disposition. We must see, therefore, whether neither of <lb/>
            them is present with the assigned genus, for if they are <note type="footnote"> I Cf. Isag. ii. 8, 21; Abelard. De Gen. et Op., ed. Cousin. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Vide Waitz in loc. </note> <pb n="423"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. II.]"/>neither subaltern genera, nor both under the same genus, what <lb/>
            is assigned will not be a genus.</p>
          <p>We must observe too the genus of the assigned <lb/>
            genus, and so always the superior genus, whether <lb/>
            all things are predicated of the species, and <lb/>
            whether they are so in reply to what a thing is, <lb/>
            2nd, Examine <lb/>
            the genus to <lb/>
            which the as­ <lb/>
            signed genus <lb/>
            belongs. <lb/>
            for all superior genera must be predicated of species, in re­ <lb/>
            spect to what a thing is; if then there is any where a discre­ <lb/>
            pancy, what is assigned, is evidently not the genus. Again, <lb/>
            whether the genus partakes of the species, either itself, or any <lb/>
            of the superior genera, as the superior (genus) partakes of <lb/>
            none of the inferior. The subverter must use what we have <lb/>
            said, but for the supporter it will be sufficient (if the pro­ <lb/>
            posed genus is admitted present with the species, but it is <lb/>
            doubtful whether it is present with genus) to show that <lb/>
            some one of the superior genera is predicated of species, in <lb/>
            reference to what a thing is. For if one thing is predicated <lb/>
            in reference to what a thing is, all, both above and below this, <lb/>
            if they are predicated of species, will be so predicated in re­ <lb/>
            ference to what a thing is, so that the assigned genus also is <lb/>
            predicated in reference to the same. But that if one is pre­ <lb/>
            dicated in reference to what a thing is, all the rest will be so, <lb/>
            if they are predicated, must be assumed from induction: never­ <lb/>
            theless, if it is doubted whether the assigned genus is simply <lb/>
            inherent, it is not enough to show that any of the superior <lb/>
            genera is predicated of species, in respect to what a thing is, <lb/>
            e. g. if some one gave lation, as the genus of walk­ <lb/>
            ing,* it is not sufficient to show that walking is <lb/>
            * Cf. Phys. 8. <lb/>
            motion, in order to prove that it is lation, since there are <lb/>
            other motions also, but we must prove besides, that walking <lb/>
            partakes of none of those in the same division, except lation. <lb/>
            For it is necessary that the participant of genus, should also <lb/>
            participate of some one species, according to the first division ; <lb/>
            if then walking, neither partakes of increase, nor of diminu­ <lb/>
            tion, nor of the other motions, it clearly partakes of lation, so <lb/>
            that lation would be the genus of walking.</p>
          <p>Again, in those where the assigned species is <lb/>
            predicated as genus, observe whether the assigned <lb/>
            genus also is predicated of the same things of <lb/>
            which species is, in reference to what a thing is, <lb/>
            3rd, Whether <lb/>
            the assigned <lb/>
            genus is predi­ <lb/>

            same, as the <lb/>
            species is pre. <pb n="424"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK IV."/>dicated of, as <lb/>
            genus. <lb/>
            likewise whether all those things which are above <lb/>
            the genus. For if there is any discrepancy, what <lb/>
            is assigned is evidently not genus, as if it were genus, all <lb/>
            things above this, and the very thing itself, would be predi­ <lb/>
            cated in reference to what a thing is, of which things species <lb/>
            also is predicated, in respect of the same. Now this is useful <lb/>

            respect to what a thing is, of which thing, species <lb/>
            also is predicated,1 but to the confirmer it is use­ <lb/>
            ful, if it is predicated in the question, what a thing <lb/>
            is. For both the genus and the species,. will <lb/>
            happen to be predicated of the same, in respect to <lb/>
            what a thing is,2 so that the same thing t is under <lb/>
            two genera,‡ wherefore the genera are necessarily <lb/>
            subaltern. If then what we wish to constitute <lb/>
            genus § is shown not to be under species, || species <lb/>
            will be evidently under it,IT so that it will have <lb/>
            been proved that this is genus.*</p>
          <p>4th, Whether <lb/>
            the definitions <lb/>
            of the genera <lb/>
            are predicated <lb/>
            of the species <lb/>
            and its sub­ <lb/>
            jects.</p>
          <p>Examine moreover, the definitions of the ge­ <lb/>
            nera, whether they suit the assigned species, and <lb/>
            the participants of the species, since it is neces­ <lb/>
            sary that the definitions of the genera, should be <lb/>
            predicated of the species, and of what partakes of <lb/>
            the species, so that if there is any where a discrepancy, it is <lb/>
            manifest that genus is not, what has been assigned.</p>
          <p>5th, Whether <lb/>
            difference has <lb/>
            been assigned <lb/>
            as a genus;</p>
          <p>Again, whether a person has given the differ­ <lb/>
            ence, as a genus, must be (looked to) ; for instance, <lb/>
            whether the immortal, as a genus of God, for im­ <lb/>
            mortal, is the difference of animal, since of animals, <lb/>
            some are mortal, but some immortal, so that there is evidently <lb/>
            an error, for the difference, is not the genus, of any thing. <lb/>
            But that this is true is evident, for no difference signifies what <note type="footnote"> I Thus, if science is not predicated of fortitude, in answer to the ques­ <lb/>
            tion, " what a thing is," it is not the genus of virtue, because fortitude is <lb/>

            be thus : since both "living" and " animal" are predicated of " man," <lb/>
            as to what he is, therefore both living and animal are subaltern genera: <lb/>
            hence as " living " is not a species of animal, (for the former is of wider <lb/>
            compass, and extends to plants,) man, must necessarily be a species <unclear>or</unclear> <lb/>

            biped.</p>
          <p>Also whether difference is placed in genus, as <lb/>
            that the odd is that which is number, since the <lb/>
            odd is a difference, not a species, of number. Nei- <lb/>
            6th, or as a <lb/>
            species. <lb/>
            ther does difference seem to partake of genus, for every thing <lb/>
            which partakes of the genus, is either species or individual; but <lb/>
            difference is neither species nor individual, wherefore clearly <lb/>
            difference, does not partake of genus, so that neither would <lb/>
            the odd, be species, but difference, since it does not partake of <lb/>
            genus.</p>
          <p>Moreover, whether genus is placed in the spe­ <lb/>
            cies, for instance, that conjunction is continuity, <lb/>
            or that mixture is temperament,*1 or as Plato <lb/>
            defines, that local motion is lation,† since it is not <lb/>
            necessary that conjunction should be continuity, <lb/>
            but on the contrary that continuity should be con­ <lb/>
            junction, since not every thing which touches is <lb/>
            continuous, but every thing which is continuous <lb/>
            touches. The like also occurs with the rest, for <lb/>
            7th, Whether <lb/>
            genus is placed <lb/>
            in species; <lb/>

            neither is all mixture, temperament, (as the mixture of dry <lb/>
            things, is not temperament,) neither is all local change, lation, <lb/>
            since walking, does not seem to be lation. For (the latter) is <lb/>
            asserted generally of those, which involuntarily change their <lb/>
            place, as happens to inanimate natures. Nevertheless, it is <lb/>
            evident, that species is more widely predicated than genus, in <lb/>
            the cases advanced, when the contrary ought to occur.</p>
          <p>Again, whether difference is placed in species, <lb/>
            as that the immortal, is that which is God. For <lb/>
            species will happen to be predicated, either equally <lb/>
            8th, or differ­ <lb/>

            placed. <lb/>
            or of more, since difference is always predicated equally with, <lb/>
            or to a greater extent than, species. Moreover, <lb/>
            whether the genus is placed in the difference, as <lb/>
            that colour, is what concretes, or that number, is <lb/>
            the odd. Likewise, if the genus has been spoken <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK IV."/>some one may adduce, even a thesis of this kind, as that <lb/>
            i mixture is the difference of temperament, or local change, the <lb/>
            difference of lation.1 All such particulars however, we must <lb/>
            consider through the same, (for places intercommunicate,) <lb/>
            since both the genus must necessarily be predicated more <lb/>
            extensively than the difference, and must not partake of dif­ <lb/>
            ference, but when it (genus) is thus assigned, neither of what <lb/>
            have been mentioned can possibly occur; for it will be spoken <lb/>
            of fewer things, and genus will partake of difference.</p>
          <p>11th, Whether <lb/>
            no difference of <lb/>
            ' genera is predi­ <lb/>
            cated of species.</p>
          <p>12th, If species <lb/>
            is naturally <lb/>
            prior to the <lb/>

            to the species.</p>
          <p>Besides, if no difference of genera is predicated <lb/>
            of the assigned species, neither will the genus be <lb/>
            predicated, thus neither the odd, nor the even, is <lb/>
            predicated of the soul; wherefore neither is num­ <lb/>
            ber. Moreover, if species is prior naturally, and <lb/>
            co-subverts the genus, (it will not be genus,) for <lb/>
            the contrary appears to be true. Once more, if <lb/>
            it is possible (for species), to leave the proposed <lb/>
            genus or difference, as to be moved, the soul, or <lb/>
            the true and false, opinion, neither of these named <lb/>

            are under genus, thus, if the soul partakes of life, but no <lb/>
            number can possibly live, the soul would not be a species of <lb/>
            number.</p>
          <p>Notice also, whether the species is equivocal <lb/>
            with the genus, employing for (the investigation <lb/>
            of) the equivocal, the elements before mentioned, <lb/>
            for genus and species, are synonymous.</p>
          <p>2nd. If the <lb/>
            species and ge­ <lb/>
            nus are not em­ <lb/>
            ployed in the <lb/>
            same sense.</p>
          <p>Since however there are many species of every <lb/>
            genus, we must observe whether there may not <lb/>
            be another species of the proposed genus, for if <lb/>
            there is not, it is evident, in short, that the thing <lb/>
            spoken of will not be genus.</p>

          <p>Likewise observe, whether a person has pro­ <lb/>
            posed as genus, that which is spoken of meta­ <lb/>
            phorically, as that temperance is symphony, for <lb/>
            every genus is properly predicated of species, but <lb/>
            symphony is not properly predicated of temper­ <lb/>
            ance, but metaphorically, for all symphony is in <lb/>
            sounds.</p>
          <p>4th. If genus <lb/>
            has not been <lb/>
            taken in its <lb/>
            right sense. <lb/>
            (Vide Aldrich, <lb/>
            cap. 1, de Me­ <lb/>

            Top. vi. 2.)</p>
          <p>Again, whether a thing be contrary to species; <lb/>
            and this consideration is multifarious; first, in­ <lb/>
            deed, whether in the same genus there is also a <lb/>
            contrary when there is not a contrary to genus,1 <lb/>
            5th. If any con­ <lb/>
            trary exist to <lb/>
            species : this <lb/>
            consideration <lb/>
            multiform. <lb/>
            for contraries must necessarily be in the same genus, if <lb/>
            nothing is contrary to genus. If however there is any thing <lb/>
            contrary to genus, we must observe whether the contrary is <lb/>
            in the contrary (genus),2 since it is necessary that the con­ <lb/>
            trary should be in the contrary, if any thing is contrary to <lb/>
            genus; each of these however appears through induction. <lb/>
            Moreover, if in short the contrary to species, is in no genus, <lb/>
            but is itself a genus, as the good, for if this is not in genus, <lb/>
            neither will the contrary to this be in genus, but will be <lb/>
            itself genus, as happens in the case of good and evil, since <lb/>
            neither of these is in genus, but is each of them a genus. <lb/>
            Further, whether both genus and species are contrary to a <lb/>
            certain thing, and whether there is any thing between some, <note type="footnote">I As, if nothing is contrary to animal, but black is contrary to white: <lb/>
            since black is not a species of animal, neither can white be. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Ignorance is contrary to science, and virtue to vice ; but virtue is not <lb/>
            a species of science, neither therefore is vice. </note> <lb/>
            <pb n="428"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK IV."/><lb/>
            but not between others. For if there is something between <lb/>
            genera, there is also between species, and if between species, <lb/>
            likewise between genera, as in virtue and vice, and justice and <lb/>
            injustice, for there is something between each of these. To <lb/>
            this it may be objected, that there is nothing between health <lb/>
            * Yet health is <lb/>
            a species of <lb/>
            good, and dis­ <lb/>
            ease of evil. <lb/>
            and disease, but that there is something between <lb/>
            evil and good,. or whether there is something <lb/>
            between both the species and genera, yet not simi­ <lb/>
            larly, but between the one negatively, and be­ <lb/>
            tween the other as a subject, for it is probable that some­ <lb/>
            thing similarly intervenes between both, as between virtue <lb/>
            and vice, justice and injustice, for there are intermediates be­ <lb/>
            tween both, according to negation. Further, when there is <lb/>
            not a contrary to genus, we must observe not only whether <lb/>
            the contrary is in the same genus, but also whether the medium <lb/>
            is, for the media are in the same genus as the extremes, as, for <lb/>
            instance, in white and black, for colour is both the genus of <lb/>
            these, and of all intermediate colours. An objection may lie, <lb/>
            that defect and excess, are in the same genus, (as both are in <lb/>
            what is evil,) but the moderate, which is a medium between <lb/>
            these, is not in what is evil, but in what is good. Notice too, <lb/>
            whether the genus is contrary to a certain thing, but the spe­ <lb/>
            cies to nothing, as if the genus is contrary to a certain thing, <lb/>
            the species is also, as virtue and vice, justice and injustice. <lb/>
            Likewise, to one who considers other things, such a thing <lb/>
            would appear evident. There is an objection in health and <lb/>
            disease, for health simply, is contrary to disease, yet a certain <lb/>
            disease, being a species of disease, is not contrary to any <lb/>
            thing, e. g. a fever and ophthalmia, and every other disease.</p>
          <p>6th. That the <lb/>
            genus is rightly <lb/>
            constituted, if <lb/>
            there be a con­ <lb/>
            trary to spe­ <lb/>
            cies, is proved <lb/>
            in three ways.</p>
          <p><lb/>
            The subverter then, must pay attention in so <lb/>
            many respects, for if what have been mentioned <lb/>
            are not inherent.1 the thing assigned is evidently <lb/>
            not a genus, but the confirmer (must regard <lb/>
            them) triply: first, whether the contrary to species <lb/>
            is in the before-named genus, when there is not a <lb/>
            contrary to the genus, for if the contrary is in this, it is evident <lb/>
            that the proposition is also:2 next, whether the medium is in <lb/>
            the above-named genus, as in what the media are the ex- <note type="footnote"> I Unless all the conditions explained are found in the proposed genus. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 As, if disease is a quality, and there is nothing repugnant to quality, <lb/>
            it follows that health is a quality. </note> <pb n="429"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. IV.]"/>tremes also are:1 lastly, if there be any thing c( ntrary to <lb/>
            genus we must notice whether the contrary also is in the con­ <lb/>
            trary, since if it be, the proposed (species) is evidently in the <lb/>
            proposed genus.2</p>
          <p>Again, in cases and co-ordinates, both the sub­ <lb/>
            verter and confirmer (must notice) whether they <lb/>
            are similarly consequent, since at the same time <lb/>
            they are present, or are not present, with one <lb/>
            thing, and with all, as if justice is a certain sci­ <lb/>
            ence, what is justly, is also scientifically, done, <lb/>

            rivations; how <lb/>
            the same topics <lb/>

            confirmation <lb/>
            and refutation. <lb/>
            and a just is a scientific man, but if something of these is not, <lb/>
            neither is any of the rest.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>SUCH things also (must be noticed), which are <lb/>
            similarly affected with respect to each other, thus <lb/>
            the pleasant subsists with reference to pleasure, <lb/>
            1st.’ Arguments <lb/>
            to be obtained <lb/>
            from similars. <lb/>
            similarly to the useful with reference to good, for each is ef­ <lb/>
            fective of the other. If then pleasure is what is good, the <lb/>
            pleasant will be what is useful, for it would be clearly effective <lb/>
            of good, since pleasure is good. The like also occurs in <lb/>
            generations and corruptions, as, if to build is to energize, to <lb/>
            have built is to have energized, and if to learn is to remem­ <lb/>
            ber, to have learned is to have remembered, and if to be dis­ <lb/>
            solved is to be corrupted, to have been dissolved is to have <lb/>
            been corrupted, and dissolution is a certain corruption. So <lb/>
            also in those which have the power to generate and to cor­ <lb/>
            rupt, and in powers and uses, and in short, according to any <lb/>
            kind of likeness, as we have observed in generation and cor­ <lb/>
            ruption, consideration must be paid both by the subverter and <lb/>
            the confirmer. For if what is corruptive dissolves, to be cor­ <lb/>
            rupted is to be dissolved, and if what is generative is effective, <lb/>
            to be generated is to be made, and generation is making, and <lb/>
            the same in powers and uses, since if power is disposition, to <lb/>
            be able also is to be disposed; and if the use of a thing is <lb/>
            energy, to use is to energize, and to have used is to have <lb/>
            energized. <note type="footnote"> I Thus, if green and red, are species of colour, black and white, als <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK V."/>
          <p>2nd. How the <lb/>
            argument <lb/>
            about genus is <lb/>
            to be conduct­ <lb/>
            ed, if what is <lb/>
            opposed to spe­ <lb/>
            cies be priva­ <lb/>
            tion.</p>
          <p>If however privation be that which is opposed <lb/>
            to species, we may confute in two ways: first, if <lb/>
            the opposed be in the assigned genus, for either <lb/>
            privation simply, is in no genus, which is the <lb/>
            same, or it is not in the (same) extreme genus, as <lb/>
            if sight is in sense, as the extreme genus, blind­ <lb/>
            ness will not be sense. Secondly, if privation is opposed both <lb/>
            to genus and to species, but the thing opposed is not in the <lb/>
            opposite, neither will the thing assigned be in the assigned;1 <lb/>
            by him therefore who subverts, this must be used as we have <lb/>
            said, but by the constructor only in one way, for if the op­ <lb/>
            posite be in the opposite, the proposition also would be in the <lb/>
            proposition, thus, if blindness be a certain privation of sense, <lb/>
            sight also is sense.</p>
          <p>3rd. Negatives <lb/>
            to be consider­ <lb/>
            ed inversely. <lb/>
            * Vide b. iL <lb/>
            ch. 8.</p>
          <p>Again, we must consider negatives inversely, <lb/>
            as was observed in the case of accident,* thus, if <lb/>
            the pleasant be what is good, what is not good is <lb/>
            not pleasant, for if it were not so, something not <lb/>
            good would be pleasant. Now it is impossible, if good is the <lb/>
            genus of the pleasant, that any thing not good should be plea­ <lb/>
            sant, for of what genus is not predicated, neither will any <lb/>
            species be. He also who confirms, must consider it in like <lb/>
            manner, since if what is not good is not pleasant, the pleasant <lb/>
            is good, so that the good is the genus of the pleasant.</p>
          <p>4th. Of expres­ <lb/>
            lion by rela­ <lb/>
            tion, if species <lb/>
            be relative, ge­ <lb/>
            nus also is.</p>
          <p>If however species be relative, we must see <lb/>
            whether genus also is relative, for if species be a <lb/>
            relative, genus is also, as in the double and the <lb/>
            multiple, for each of these is a relative. If then <lb/>
            genus be a relative, it is not requisite that species <lb/>
            also should be, for science is of the number of relatives, but <lb/>
            grammar is not. Or does what was before asserted appear <lb/>
            neither to be true ? for virtue is that which is beautiful and <lb/>
            which is good, and virtue is a relative, but the good and the <lb/>
            beautiful are not relatives, but qualities.</p>
          <p>5th. If species <lb/>
            be not referred <lb/>
            to the same <lb/>
            thing, both per <lb/>
            Be, and accord­ <lb/>
            ing to genus.</p>
          <p>Moreover, (notice) whether species is not re­ <lb/>
            ferred to the same thing, both per se, and accord­ <lb/>
            ing to genus, as if the double is said to be the <lb/>
            double of the half, it is necessary also that the <lb/>
            multiple should be said (to be the multiple) of <note type="footnote"> I Thus, if ignorance is not privation of sense, science is not sense. </note> <pb n="431"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. IV.]"/>the half, for if not the multiple will not be the genus of the <lb/>
            double.</p>
          <p>Besides, whether it is not referred to the same <lb/>
            thing, both according to genus and according to <lb/>
            all the genera of the genus, for if the double and <lb/>
            the multiple are with reference to the half. to <lb/>
            6th. Or accord­ <lb/>
            ing to all the <lb/>
            genera of the <lb/>
            genus. Ob­ <lb/>
            jection. <lb/>
            exceed will also, be predicated of the half, and in short, ac­ <lb/>
            cording to all the superior genera there will be a reference to <lb/>
            the half. It is objected, that a reference to the same thing <lb/>
            is not necessary per se, and according to genus, for science is <lb/>
            said to be of that which is the object of science, but habit and <lb/>
            disposition are not predicated with reference to the object of <lb/>
            science, but to the soul.</p>
          <p>Again, whether genus and species are predi­ <lb/>
            cated in the same manner as to case, as whether <lb/>
            pertaining to a certain thing, or predicated of <lb/>
            something, or in some other way, for as species, <lb/>
            7th. Whether <lb/>
            genus and <lb/>
            species are pre­ <lb/>
            dicated in the <lb/>
            same case. <lb/>
            so also is genus (predicated), as in the double, and the superior <lb/>
            (genera), for both the double and the multiple are predicated <lb/>
            of a certain thing. Likewise in the case of science, for both <lb/>
            science itself and its genera, as disposition and habit, are (pre­ <lb/>
            dicated) of a certain thing. It is objected, that sometimes this <lb/>
            is not the case, for " the different, * and " the con­ <lb/>
            trary,” (are predicated) with reference to a certain <lb/>
            thing, but " another " t being the genus of these, <lb/>
            is not predicated with reference to, but from, <lb/>
            * TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">διάφορον</foreign>. <lb/>
            t TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔτερον</foreign>. <lb/>
            something, for (a thing) is so predicated " another," (which is <lb/>
            different) from, something else.</p>
          <p>Moreover, whether what are similarly called <lb/>
            relatives, according to cases, do not similarly re­ <lb/>
            ciprocate, as with the double and the multiple, for <lb/>
            each of these is said to be of something, both it­ <lb/>
            self, and reciprocally, for both the half and the <lb/>
            8th. Whether <lb/>
            those similarly <lb/>
            called relatives <lb/>
            as to cases, do <lb/>
            not alike reci­ <lb/>
            procate. <lb/>
            least part, (are said to be so) of something. Likewise with <lb/>
            science and opinion, for these are said to be of a certain thing <lb/>
            and similarly reciprocate, and both the object of science and <lb/>
            of opinion are predicated with reference to something. If, <lb/>
            then, the reciprocation is not similar in the respect of some­ <lb/>
            thing, one is evidently not the genus of the other.</p>
          <p>Again, if genus and species are not predicated <lb/>
            with reference to an equal number of things, for <lb/>
            9th. In as <lb/>

            so many also, <lb/>
            ought genus to <lb/>

            versA. <lb/>
            each, seems predicated similarly, and of the same <lb/>
            number, as in " a gift," and “giving,” for a “gift,” <lb/>
            is said to be "of" some one, or "to" some one, <lb/>
            and " giving " also, " of” a certain one, and " to" a <lb/>
            certain one ; still "giving" is the genus of "gift," <lb/>
            for” a gift," is " a giving " not to be returned. With some, pre­ <lb/>
            dication with reference to an equal number, does not occur; <lb/>
            for the double is the double of something, but the excessive, <lb/>
            anc the greater, (are predicated) of, and with reference to, a <lb/>
            certain thing, for every thing excessive, and that which is <lb/>
            greater, exceeds in something, and is the excess of a certain <lb/>
            thing. Wherefore, what are mentioned, are not the genera of <lb/>
            the double, since they are not predicated with reference to an <lb/>
            equal number in species, or it is not universally true that <lb/>
            species and genus are predicated with reference to an equal <lb/>
            number of things.1</p>
          <p>I th. Whether <lb/>
            the opposite is <lb/>
            the genus of <lb/>
            the opposite.</p>
          <p>Examine, likewise, whether the opposite is the <lb/>
            genus of the opposite, as if the multiple is the <lb/>
            genus of the double, the sub-multiple is so, of the <lb/>
            half, for the opposite must necessarily be the genus <lb/>
            of the opposite. If, then, any one asserts science to be sense, it <lb/>
            will be requisite that the object of science should be sensible, <lb/>
            which, however, is not the case, for not every object of science <lb/>
            is sensible, as some things intelligible are objects of science. <lb/>
            Wherefore, the sensible is not the genus of the object of <lb/>
            science, but if it be not, neither is sense, the genus of science.</p>
          <p>11th. If genus <lb/>
            and species are <lb/>
            stated as re­ <lb/>
            lated to some­ <lb/>
            thing, they <lb/>
            ought to have <lb/>
            the same ratio <lb/>
            to those in <lb/>
            which they are <lb/>
            inherent.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, since of those which are enunci­ <lb/>
            ated with reference to any thing, some are neces­ <lb/>
            sarily in, or about, those, to which they happen to <lb/>
            be referred, as disposition, habit, and symmetry, <lb/>
            (for these can possibly be in nothing else, than in <lb/>
            those things to which they are referred;) but <lb/>
            others are not necessarily in those, to which they <lb/>
            are sometimes referred, yet may be in them, (as if the soul is <lb/>
            an object of science, since nothing prevents the soul having <lb/>
            * Vide de <lb/>
            Anima. <lb/>
            science of itself,* yet it is not necessary, since <lb/>
            this very science may possibly be in something <note type="footnote"> 1 Vide Mansel's, Whately's, and Hill's Logics. Cf. also Porphyry's <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. V.]"/>else;) others, again, cannot simply be inherent in those to <lb/>
            which they happen to be referred, (as the contrary can <lb/>
            neither be in the contrary, nor science in its object, unless <lb/>
            the object of science should be the soul or man ;) we must <lb/>
            observe, whether any one places a thing of this kind in a <lb/>
            genus, which is not of this kind, as if he declared that memory <lb/>
            is the permanency of science. For all permanency is in, and <lb/>
            about, that which is permanent, so that the permanency of <lb/>
            science is in science; memory therefore is in science, since it <lb/>
            is the permanency of science, yet this is impossible, for all <lb/>
            memory is in the soul.1* The place here spoken <lb/>
            of, is common also to accident, for it does not <lb/>
            signify whether we say that permanency is the <lb/>

            way whatever, memory is the permanency of science, the <lb/>

          <p>AGAIN, it a person has referred habit to energy, <lb/>
            or the energy to the habit,2 as that sense is a <lb/>
            motion through the body, for sense is a habit, but <lb/>
            motion an energy. Likewise, if he has stated <lb/>
            memory to be a habit retentive of opinion, since no <lb/>
            memory is a habit, but rather an energy.</p>

            stating the <lb/>
            genus, who <lb/>
            refer energy to <lb/>
            habit, and vice <lb/>
            versA.</p>
          <p>They also err, who arrange habit under con­ <lb/>
            sequent power, as that. mildness is a command of <lb/>

            is not carried away.3 † Perhaps, therefore, such <lb/>

            a power as this is consequent to each, so that if <lb/>
            he suffers, he should not be transported by, but <lb/>
            command (passion). Yet this is not the essence <lb/>
            of a courageous or a mild man, but not to be affected at all, <lb/>
            by such things.</p>
          <p>3rd. Or assume <lb/>
            as genus, what <lb/>
            is in some way <lb/>
            consequent to <lb/>
            species.</p>
          <p>Sometimes, indeed, they admit as genus, that <lb/>
            which is in any way consequent, as that pain is <lb/>
            the genus of anger, and opinion of faith, for both <lb/>
            these we have named follow in a certain way the <lb/>
            assigned species, yet neither of them is a genus, for the angry <lb/>
            man is pained,1 pain having been produced in him before, <lb/>
            since the anger is not the cause of the pain, but the pain of <lb/>
            the anger, so that anger simply is not pain. On this account, <lb/>
            neither is faith opinion, since it is possible to have an opinion <lb/>
            of, without believing in, a thing; and this is impossible, if faith <lb/>
            is a species of opinion, for it is impossible that a thing should <lb/>
            remain the same any longer, if it has been altogether changed <lb/>
            from species, as neither can the same animal by possibility <lb/>
            be sometimes man, but sometimes not. Still, if any one say, <lb/>
            that he who opines, of necessity also believes, opinion and <lb/>
            faith will be predicated of an equality, so that neither thus can <lb/>
            it be genus, since it is necessary that genus possess a greater <lb/>
            extent of predication.</p>
          <p>4th. Genus and <lb/>
            species ought <lb/>
            to be inherent <lb/>
            in the same.</p>
          <p>Observe, moreover, whether both are naturally <lb/>
            adapted to be in any the same thing, for in what <lb/>
            the species is, the genus also is, as in what there <lb/>
            is whiteness, there is also colour, and in what <lb/>
            grammar is present, science also is. If then, any one should <lb/>
            say that shame is fear, or that anger is pain, species and genus <lb/>
            will not happen to be in the same thing, since shame is in <lb/>
            ✹ Vide Eth. i. <lb/>

            the reasoning, but fear in the irascible part of the <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. V.]"/>since they are not naturally adapted to be in the same (sub­ <lb/>
            ject) with the species. In like manner also, if friendship be <lb/>
            in the appetitive, it could not be a certain will, for all will, is <lb/>
            in the reasoning part. This place, indeed, is useful for acci­ <lb/>
            dent, also; for accident, and that to which it is accidental, are <lb/>
            in the same thing, so that unless they should appear in the <lb/>
            same thing, they are evidently not accidents.</p>
          <p>Further, (notice) whether species partakes of <lb/>
            what is said to be genus partially, since genus <lb/>
            does not appear to be partially participated, as <lb/>
            man is not partially an animal, nor grammar par­ <lb/>
            tially a science, likewise also, in other things. <lb/>
            5th. Species <lb/>
            ought to par­ <lb/>
            take of genus, <lb/>
            " simpliciter <lb/>
            non quodam <lb/>
            modo." <lb/>
            Observe, therefore, whether genus is partially partaken of in <lb/>
            certain things, as if animal has been said to be that which is <lb/>
            sensible or visible, for animal is partially sensible and visible ; <lb/>
            as to the body, sensible and visible, but not as to the soul; so <lb/>
            that the visible and the sensible would not be the genus of <lb/>
            animal.</p>
          <p>Sometimes, indeed, they insensibly transfer the <lb/>
            whole to a part, for instance, that animal is ani­ <lb/>
            mated body; yet the part is by no means predi­ <lb/>
            cated of the whole, so that body would not be the <lb/>
            genus of animal, since it is a part.</p>
          <p>6th. Error In <lb/>
            taking a part <lb/>
            of species for <lb/>
            genus.</p>
          <p>Also, see if any thing to be blamed or avoided is <lb/>
            referred to power or to the possible, as that a soph­ <lb/>
            ist (is one able to acquire wealth from apparent <lb/>

            make enemies of his friends), or that a thief is one able secretly <lb/>
            to steal the property of others. For no one of the above- <lb/>
            named is said to be such in consequence of being able to act <lb/>
            in this way, for both God and a good man are able to perform <lb/>
            base actions, yet they are not such in character, since all de­ <lb/>
            based characters are called so, on account of their deliberate <lb/>
            choice.1 Besides, all power is of the number of eligible things, <note type="footnote"> 1 “<foreign xml:lang="grc">Προαίρεσις</foreign>,” says Aristotle, (Ethics iii. 2,) " appears to be most <lb/>
            intimately connected with virtue, and, even more than actions, to be a test <lb/>

            without the will, to do so. Compare also the characteristic of the rea. <lb/>

            that both God and the good man possess them, for they are <lb/>
            able to perform base actions. So that power would not be the <lb/>
            genus of any thing blameable, otherwise it would happen that <lb/>
            something blameable was eligible, since there will be a certain <lb/>

          <p>Also, (notice) whether any thing which is of <lb/>
            itself honourable or eligible, is referred to power, <lb/>
            or to the possible, or to the effective, for every <lb/>
            power and everything possible or efficient is <lb/>
            eligible, on account of something else, or whether <lb/>
            any one of those things which are in two or in <lb/>
            more genera, have been referred to one, since some things <lb/>
            cannot be reduced to one genus, as an impostor and a calum­ <lb/>
            niator ; as neither is he who deliberately chooses, but is inca­ <lb/>
            pable of effecting, nor he who is capable, but does not pre­ <lb/>
            viously choose, a calumniator or an impostor, but he who has <lb/>
            both these ; so that we must not place the above-named in one <lb/>
            genus, but in both genera.</p>
          <p>9th. Error in <lb/>
            assigning ge­ <lb/>
            nus as differ­ <lb/>
            ence, and vice <lb/>
            versa.</p>
          <p>Yet further, vice versa, sometimes they assign <lb/>
            genus as the difference, and the difference as <lb/>
            genus; e. g. that astonishment is the excess of <lb/>
            admiration, and that faith is the vehemence of <lb/>
            opinion. For neither excess nor vehemence is genus, but dif­ <lb/>
            ference ; since astonishment seems to be excessive admiration, <lb/>
            and faith vehement opinion ; so that admiration and opinion are <lb/>
            genus, but excess and vehemence are difference. Moreover, <lb/>
            if any one should assign excess and vehemence as genera, in­ <lb/>
            animate things would be susceptible of faith and astonishment, <lb/>
            for the vehemence and excess of each thing is present with <lb/>
            that of which it is the vehemence and excess; if then astonish­ <lb/>
            ment is the excess of admiration, astonishment will be present <lb/>
            with admiration, so that admiration will be astonished. In a <lb/>
            similar manner also, faith will be present to opinion, if it is <lb/>
            the vehemence of opinion, so that opinion will believe. Again, <lb/>
            it will occur to him who thus assigns (genus), to call vehe­ <lb/>
            mence vehement, and excess excessive, for there is a vehe­ <lb/>
            ment faith, if then faith is vehemence, vehemence would be <note type="footnote"> 1 This is doubtless one great element of our interest in the character <lb/>
            of the devil, drawn by Milton. We all think it " good to have a giant's <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. V.]"/>vehement, likewise also there is an exceeding astonishment, <lb/>
            if then astonishment is excess, excess would be exceeding <lb/>
            Nevertheless, neither of these seems right, as neither is sci <lb/>
            ence the object of science, nor motion that which is moved.</p>
          <p>Sometimes, indeed, an error arises from placing <lb/>
            passion in that which suffers, as a genus, which <lb/>
            happens to as many as declare immortality to be <lb/>
            perpetual life; for immortality appears to be a <lb/>
            lOth. Also in <lb/>
            making the <lb/>
            thing affected, <lb/>

            certain passion or symptom of life,1 and that what we have <lb/>
            stated is true, may become evident, if any one admits that a <lb/>
            person from being mortal has become immortal, for no one <lb/>
            would say that he takes another life, but that a certain symp­ <lb/>
            tom or passion accedes to this life, wherefore life is not the <lb/>
            genus of immortality.</p>
          <p>Again, (an error occurs) if that of which there <lb/>
            is passion, they declare to be the genus of the pas­ <lb/>
            sion, as that wind is air in motion, for wind is <lb/>
            rather the motion of air, ✹ since the same air <lb/>

            * Cf, Lucret. i. <lb/>

            else there would be wind when the air is not moved, since <lb/>
            the same air remains stationary which was wind. The like <lb/>
            will also happen in other such things, if then it is necessary <lb/>
            in this to grant that wind is air in motion, yet such a thing is <lb/>
            not to be admitted in all cases, (i. e.) of which the proposed <lb/>
            genus is not truly predicated, but in those only wherein it is <lb/>
            truly predicated. For in some it does not appear truly predi­ <lb/>
            cated, as in clay and snow, for they describe snow to be con­ <lb/>
            gealed water; but clay, earth, mingled with moisture; yet <lb/>
            neither is snow, water; nor clay, earth; so that neither of the <lb/>

          <p>1st. Examine <lb/>
            whether the <lb/>
            proposed genus <lb/>
            possesses sub­ <lb/>
            ject species.</p>
          <p>FURTHER, (we must notice) whether, in short, <lb/>
            what is proposed is the genus of nothing, for (if <lb/>
            so) it will evidently not be that of the thing enun­ <lb/>
            ciated ; but this must be considered from those <lb/>
            which are participant of the assigned genus, not at all differ­ <lb/>
            ing in species, as, for instance, white things, for such do not <lb/>
            at all differ in species from each other; yet of every genus <lb/>
            the species are different, so that whiteness will not be the <lb/>
            genus of any thing.</p>
          <p>2nd. Whether <lb/>
            the consequent <lb/>
            of all, has been <lb/>
            taken as genus <lb/>
            or difference.</p>
          <p>* Metap. lib. <lb/>
            ix. (x.) xi. <lb/>
            (xii.) Leipsic; <lb/>
            De Anim. lib. <lb/>
            i. and ii. 1.</p>
          <p>Again, whether that which is consequent to all, <lb/>
            has been declared genus or difference, for many <lb/>
            things are consequent to all, as " being," and " the <lb/>
            one," are of the number of things consequent to <lb/>
            all. ✹ If then a person has assigned being as <lb/>
            genus, it will evidently be the genus of all things, <lb/>
            since it is predicated of them, for genus is predi­ <lb/>
            cated of nothing else than of species, so that " the <lb/>
            one " will be a species of " being." 2 Of all then of which genus <lb/>
            is predicated, it happens that species is also predicated, since <lb/>
            "being," and " the one," are simply predicated of all, when it is <lb/>
            t i. e. than ge­ <lb/>
            nus. <lb/>
            necessary that species should be predicated to a <lb/>
            less extent.† If however he has stated that what <lb/>
            is consequent to all, is difference, it is manifest <lb/>
            that difference will be predicated to an equal or greater ex­ <lb/>
            tent than genus, for if genus is of the number of things con­ <lb/>
            sequent to all, it will be predicated to an equal extent, but if <lb/>
            genus does not follow all, difference will be predicated to a <lb/>
            greater extent than it. <note type="footnote"> 1 The whole verse of Empedocles is given by Plutarch, " de causis <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. VI.]"/>
          <p>Yet more, (we must observe) whether the as­ <lb/>
            signed genus is stated to be in the subject species,1 <lb/>
            as whiteness in snow, so that it will evidently not <lb/>
            be genus, for genus is predicated alone of the sub­ <lb/>
            ject species.</p>
          <p>3rd. Whether <lb/>
            the assigned <lb/>
            genus is stated <lb/>
            to be in the sub­ <lb/>
            ject species.</p>
          <p>Notice, moreover, whether genus and species <lb/>
            are not synonymous, as genus is synonymously <lb/>
            predicated of all the species.</p>
          <p>4th. Whether <lb/>
            genus and spe­ <lb/>
            cies are not sy­ <lb/>
            nonymous, etc.</p>
          <p>Besides, (it is erroneous) when there being a <lb/>
            contrary both to species and to genus, the better <lb/>
            of the contraries is referred to the worse genus, <lb/>
            for the remainder will happen to be in the re­ <lb/>
            mainder, since contraries are in contrary genera, <lb/>
            so that the better. will be in the worse,†3 and <lb/>
            the worse in the better, yet the genus of the bet- <lb/>
            5th. Error in <lb/>
            assigning the <lb/>
            better of two <lb/>
            contraries to <lb/>
            the worse ge­ <lb/>
            nus. <lb/>
            * Species. <lb/>
            t Genus. <lb/>
            ter, seems also to be better. Also, if when the same species sub­ <lb/>
            sists similarly, with regard to both, it is referred to the worse, <lb/>
            and not to the better genus, e. g. that the soul is motion or <lb/>
            what is moved. For the same (soul) appears equally to pos­ <lb/>
            sess the power of resting and moving, so that if permanency <lb/>
            be better, it ought to be referred to this genus.</p>
          <p>Again, the subverter (may argue) from the <lb/>
            more and less, if genus accepts the more, but <lb/>
            species does not, neither itself, nor what is enun­ <lb/>
            ciated according to it. For instance, if virtue <lb/>
            6th. Argument <lb/>
            useful to the <lb/>
            subverter from <lb/>
            the more and <lb/>
            less. <lb/>
            accepts the more, justice also, and the just man ( do so, for one <lb/>
            is said to be more just than another, if then the assigned <lb/>
            genus accepts the more, but the species does not, neither itself, <lb/>
            nor what is enunciated according to it, the thing assigned <lb/>
            cannot be genus.</p>
          <p>Again, if what seems to be the more or simi­ <lb/>
            larly, is not genus, it is evident that neither is the <lb/>
            7th. If the more <lb/>
            or similar be <note type="footnote"> 1 Therefore is an accident and not genus. </note><note type="footnote"> 9 Genus, so far as it is genus, is predicated of species; for as Porphyry <lb/>
            observes, genus and species are relatives. Still the same thing, so far as <lb/>
            genus, may be predicated of species, and so far as an accident, may be <lb/>
            predicated of subjects; thus colour, so far as a genus, is predicated of <lb/>
            white and black, but so far as an accident, may be predicated of body. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Thus justice and injustice are contraries, and good counsel and bad <lb/>
            counsel: when therefore Thrasymachus, in Plato's Republic, says that <lb/>
            injustice is good counsel, he is forced to confess justice to be bad counsel, <lb/>
            so that he reduces the better species to the worse genus, and the worse <lb/>
            species to the better genus. </note> <pb n="440"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK IV."/>not genus, nei­ <lb/>
            ther is that <lb/>
            which is as­ <lb/>
            signed. <lb/>
            thing assigned. This place however is useful, <lb/>
            especially in such things wherein those appear <lb/>
            many, which are predicated of species, in refer­ <lb/>
            ence to the question what a thing is, and when there has not <lb/>
            been definition, neither can we say what is their genus; as of <lb/>
            anger, both pain, and the opinion of contempt, seem to be pre­ <lb/>
            dicated, in reference to what a thing is, since the angry man <lb/>
            is pained, and thinks that he is contemned. Indeed there <lb/>
            is the same consideration in species, to any one comparing it <lb/>
            with something else, as if the more, or what appears simi­ <lb/>
            larly to be in the assigned genus, is not in the genus, the as­ <lb/>
            signed species, it is evident, cannot be in the genus.</p>
          <p>8th. This place <lb/>
            not useful to <lb/>
            the supporter, <lb/>
            if the assigned <lb/>
            genus and spe­ <lb/>
            cies accept the <lb/>
            more. Com­ <lb/>
            parison of ge­ <lb/>
            nera, etc., use­ <lb/>
            ful.</p>
          <p>The subverter then must employ this as we <lb/>
            have said, but to the supporter this place is not <lb/>
            useful, if the assigned genus and species accept the <lb/>
            more, for there is nothing to prevent, when both <lb/>
            accept it, one from becoming the genus of the <lb/>
            other; for both the beautiful and the white ac­ <lb/>
            cept the more, and neither is the genus of the <lb/>
            other. Yet the comparison of the genera and of the species <lb/>
            with each other is useful, as if this, and that, are similarly <lb/>
            genus, if one of them is genus, the other also is. Likewise, <lb/>
            * Vide Ethics <lb/>
            iv. 9, and vii. 7. <lb/>
            if the less, the more also is, as if power more <lb/>
            than virtue is the genus of continence,. but vir­ <lb/>
            tue is a genus, so likewise power. The same <lb/>
            things will be adapted to be said also of species, for if this, <lb/>
            and that, are similarly species of the proposed (genus), if one <lb/>
            be species, the other also is, and if the less seeming is species, <lb/>
            the more is likewise.</p>
          <p>9th. To estab­ <lb/>
            lish genus we <lb/>
            must show that <lb/>
            it comprehends <lb/>
            species, with <lb/>
            whose nature <lb/>
            it concurs.</p>
          <p>t Taylor and <lb/>
            Buhle add <lb/>
            here, the latter <lb/>
            in brackets, <lb/>
            “and will be <lb/>
            acknowledged <lb/>
            to be a genus."</p>
          <p>Moreover, in order to confirm, we must examine <lb/>
            whether the genus in those things in which it is <lb/>
            assigned, is predicated in reference to what a <lb/>
            thing is, when the assigned species is not one, <lb/>
            but there are many and different (species), for it <lb/>
            will be evidently genus.1 But if the assigned spe­ <lb/>
            cies be one, see whether the genus is predicated <lb/>
            also of other species in reference to what a thing is ; <lb/>
            since, again, it will occur that the same thing is pre­ <lb/>
            dicated of those which are many and different.† <note type="footnote"> 1 As animal is the genus of man and horse, because these differ in spe­ <lb/>
            cies, and animal is essentially predicated of both. </note> <pb n="441"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. VI.]"/></p>
          <p>Nevertheless, since difference also appears to <lb/>
            some to be predicated of species, in reference to <lb/>
            what a thing is,. we must separate genus from <lb/>
            difference, by employing the above-mentioned <lb/>
            elements: t first, indeed, because genus is of wider <lb/>
            predication than difference ; next, because genus <lb/>
            10th. How ge­ <lb/>
            nus is to be <lb/>
            distinguished <lb/>
            from difference. <lb/>
            ✹ Cf. Porphy. <lb/>
            ry's I sag. <lb/>
            t As in chap. 2. <lb/>
            is more suitable than difference to enunciate, in answer to the <lb/>
            question what a thing is; for he who says that man is an <lb/>
            animal, developes in a greater degree what man is, than he <lb/>
            who terms him pedestrian-and because the difference always <lb/>
            signifies the quality of the genus, but the genus not that of <lb/>
            the difference; for whoever terms man pedestrian, describes <lb/>
            what kind of animal he is ; t but he who calls <lb/>
            him animal, does not describe of what quality is <lb/>
            the pedestrian. <lb/>
            ‡ Quale quid <lb/>
            dicit animal. <lb/>
            Buhle.</p>
          <p>Thus then, we must separate the difference <lb/>
            from the genus; since however what is musical, <lb/>
            so far as it is musical, appears to be scientific, <lb/>
            and music to be a certain science, and if what <lb/>
            11th. We must <lb/>
            collect the ge­ <lb/>
            nus from the <lb/>
            noun and its <lb/>
            derivatives. <lb/>
            walks is moved by walking, walking to be a certain motion, <lb/>
            we must consider in what genus we desire to construct any <lb/>
            thing after the manner stated, e. g. if (we wish to show) that <lb/>
            science is faith, (we must notice) whether he who is scien­ <lb/>
            tifically cognizant, so far as he is so, believes; for it will be <lb/>
            evident that science is a certain faith, and the same method <lb/>
            (must be used in other such cases.</p>
          <p>Once more, since it is difficult to separate what <lb/>
            is always consequent to a certain thing, and does <lb/>
            not reciprocate, (so as to show) that it is not <lb/>
            genus, if this is consequent to every individual of <lb/>
            that, but that not to every individual of this-as <lb/>
            quiet to tranquillity, and divisibility to number, <lb/>
            12th. Examine <lb/>
            whether one is <lb/>
            a consequent <lb/>
            to the other, <lb/>
            whilst the two <lb/>
            do not recipro­ <lb/>
            cate. <lb/>
            but not the contrary, (as not every thing divisible is number, <lb/>
            neither (all) quiet, tranquillity,)—(the disputant) must em­ <lb/>
            ploy this place, as if genus were that which is always conse­ <lb/>
            quent, when the other does not reciprocate; but if another <lb/>
            proposes (this argument), it must not be admitted in all cases. <lb/>
            The objection to it is, that non-entity is consequent to every <lb/>
            thing generated,1 (for what is being generated, is not,) and <note type="footnote"> I That is, which is becoming to be, or passing into existence. </note> <pb n="442"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK V."/>does not reciprocate, (for not every non-entity is generated,) <lb/>
            yet, nevertheless, non-entity is not the genus of what is being <lb/>
            generated, for simply non-entity has no species. About genus <lb/>
            then, we must carry on the discussion, as we have stated.</p>

            the same denied of another, two problems only <lb/>
            arise, as of man with regard to horse, the property is that he <lb/>
            is a biped. For that man is not a biped may be argued by <lb/>
            some one, also that a horse is a biped, and in both ways the <lb/>
            property may be removed. But if each is affirmed of each, <lb/>
            and denied of each, there will be four problems, as the pro­ <lb/>
            perty of man with reference to horse is that the former is <lb/>
            biped, but the latter quadruped, for that man is not a biped <lb/>
            and that he is naturally a quadruped may be argued, and that <lb/>
            a horse is a biped and not a quadruped is capable of argument, <lb/>
            in whatever way therefore it is shown, the proposition is sub­ <lb/>
            verted.</p>

            perty per se, <lb/>
            and with refer-</p>
          <p>That indeed is property per se, which is attri­ <lb/>
            buted to all, and separates from every thing, as of <lb/>
            man to be a mortal animal capable of science. <note type="footnote"> 1 Cf. Whately's Logic, book ii. ch. 5, sec. 3; Mansel's Aldrich; Pore <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. I.]"/>Property on the other hand with relation to an­ <lb/>
            other, is that which does not separate from every <lb/>
            ence to some­ <lb/>
            thing. <lb/>
            thing, but from a certain definite thing, as of virtue in regard <lb/>
            to science, the property is that the one is naturally adapted <lb/>
            to be in many, but the other in the reasoning faculty alone, <lb/>
            and in those who possess the reasoning faculty. <lb/>
            Again, the property always" is that which is <lb/>
            true at all times and never fails, as of animal to <lb/>
            be composed of soul and body, but the property <lb/>
            4. Also between <lb/>
            that "always" <lb/>
            and " some­ <lb/>
            times." <lb/>
            " sometimes " is that which is true at a certain time, yet does <lb/>
            not always follow from necessity, as of a certain man to walk <lb/>
            in the Forum.</p>
          <p>We may however assign property with refer­ <lb/>
            ence to something else, when we assert that dif­ <lb/>
            ference is either in all and always, or for the most <lb/>
            part, and in most, for instance, in all and always, <lb/>
            as the property of man with respect to horse is <lb/>
            the being biped, for both always and every man <lb/>
            5. What is as­ <lb/>
            signed with re­ <lb/>
            ference to an­ <lb/>
            other, is either <lb/>
            always, or for <lb/>
            the most part, <lb/>
            property. <lb/>
            is a biped, but no horse is ever a biped. For the most part <lb/>
            and in most, as the property of the rational in regard to the <lb/>
            appetitive and irascible part, is that the one commands, but <lb/>
            the other obeys, since neither does the rational always govern, <lb/>
            but sometimes is also governed, nor are the appetitive and <lb/>
            irascible always governed, but sometimes also govern when <lb/>
            a man's soul is depraved.</p>
          <p>Of properties however those are especially lo­ <lb/>
            gical, which are per se, and always, with reference <lb/>
            to something else. For the property with refer­ <lb/>
            ence to something else produces many problems, <lb/>
            as also we observed before, since either two or <lb/>
            four problems arise from necessity, wherefore <lb/>
            many arguments originate in reference to these. <lb/>
            6. Disputation <lb/>
            generally con­ <lb/>
            versant with <lb/>
            that property <lb/>
            which is per se, <lb/>
            and always, <lb/>
            and which is <lb/>
            referred to an­ <lb/>
            other. <lb/>
            Still we may argue about what is per se and always, in refer­ <lb/>
            ence to many things, or observe it with regard to many times, <lb/>
            what is per se indeed, with reference to many things, for it is <lb/>
            necessary that property should be present with a subject in <lb/>
            regard to each thing that exists, so that if it is not separated <lb/>
            as to all, it would not be well assigned as property. But we <lb/>
            may observe that which is always, with regard to many times, <lb/>
            and both whether it is not present, or was not present, or will <lb/>
            not be present, it will not be property. But the property at <pb n="444"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK V."/>a certain time, we observe as to the present time, wherefore <lb/>
            there are not many arguments belonging to it, but that is a <lb/>
            logical problem, in reference to which numerous and good <lb/>
            arguments may be framed.</p>
          <p>7. The last to <lb/>
            be considered <lb/>
            from the topics <lb/>
            of accident.</p>
          <p>What therefore is stated to be property with <lb/>
            reference to something else, must be considered <lb/>
            from the places concerning accident, viz. whether <lb/>
            it happens to one, but not to another, but those <lb/>
            which are at all times, and per se, we must examine by the <lb/>
            following places.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>1. What con­ <lb/>
            stitutes a good <lb/>
            exposition of <lb/>
            property, is its <lb/>
            being more evi­ <lb/>
            dent than its <lb/>
            subject.</p>
          <p>FIRST, (it must be considered) whether property <lb/>
            be not well or be well explained; of the ill or <lb/>
            well,1 one point indeed is, if the property is laid <lb/>
            down, not through things which are more known, <lb/>
            or which are more known; subverting it, if not <lb/>
            through things more known, but confirming it if through <lb/>
            things more known. Now of the (being laid down), not <lb/>
            through things more known, one (place) is, if the property <lb/>
            which a person assigns, is altogether more unknown, than that <lb/>
            of which he states it to be the property, for the property will <lb/>
            not be well laid down. For we introduce property for the <lb/>
            sake of knowledge, wherefore it should be assigned through <lb/>
            things more known, for thus it will be more possible sum­ <lb/>
            ciently to apprehend it. For instance, since he who lays it <lb/>
            down as the property of fire to be most similar to the soul, <lb/>
            employs the soul, which is more unknown than fire, (for we <lb/>
            know more what fire, than what the soul, is,) it would not be <lb/>
            well laid down as the property of fire to be most similar to the <lb/>
            soul. Another (way) is, if it is not more known that this is <lb/>
            present with that, since it is necessary not only that (the pro­ <lb/>
            perty) should be more known than the thing, but also that it <lb/>
            should be more known to be present with this thing, since he <lb/>
            who is ignorant, whether it is present with this thing, will not <lb/>
            know whether it is present with this alone, so that whatever <lb/>
            of these happens to be the case, the property becomes obscure. <lb/>
            For instance, since he who lays down the property of fire, to <note type="footnote"> 1 That is, of the question whether it be rightly or wrongly explained.</note> <pb n="445"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. II.]"/>be that, in which first, soul is naturally adapted to be,1 uses <lb/>
            what is more unknown than fire, if soul is inherent in this, <lb/>
            and if it is inherent in this first, hence that in which first, soul <lb/>
            is naturally adapted to be, would not be well placed as the <lb/>
            property of fire. We confirm property indeed, if it is placed <lb/>
            through things more known, and if through things more <lb/>
            known according to each mode, for according to this, property <lb/>
            will be well placed, since of the topics capable of confirming any <lb/>
            thing well, some will show that it is placed according to this <lb/>
            only, but others simply that it is well placed.- <lb/>
            For instance, since he who says that the property <lb/>
            * So Buhle. <lb/>
            of animal is to possess sense, assigns the property through <lb/>
            things more known, and in a manner more known, according <lb/>
            to each mode, after this it would be well assigned, as the pro­ <lb/>
            perty of animal to possess sense.</p>
          <p>In the next place, we subvert it, (property,) if <lb/>
            some one of the names which are assigned in the <lb/>
            property is multifariously predicated, or if alto­ <lb/>
            gether the sentence also signifies many things, for <lb/>
            the property will not be laid down. For instance, <lb/>
            since to perceive signifies many things,† 2 one to <lb/>
            possess sense, but another to use sense, a natural <lb/>
            2. Assignment <lb/>
            of property is <lb/>
            subverted if <lb/>
            there be some <lb/>
            name or sen­ <lb/>
            tence of various <lb/>
            signification. <lb/>
            t Cf. De Anim. <lb/>
            iii. 3, 1. <lb/>
            aptitude to sensation would not be well laid down as the property <lb/>
            of animal. On this account we must neither employ a name <lb/>
            of multifarious signification nor a sentence, as signifying pro­ <lb/>
            perty, because what is multifariously predicated, renders the <lb/>
            statement obscure; he who is about to argue being in doubt <lb/>
            which of the things multifariously predicated he (the other) <lb/>
            means, for property is assigned for the sake of learning. Be­ <lb/>
            sides, there must of necessity be a certain elenchus against <lb/>
            those who thus explain property, when in (a signification in) <lb/>
            which what is proposed is false, some one frames a syllogism <note type="footnote"> 1 Vide De Anim. i. 2, sec. 3; ii. 11. The opinion here alluded to, <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK V."/>of what is multifariously predicated. On the other hand, we <lb/>
            confirm it, if neither any one of the names, nor the whole <lb/>
            sentence signify many things; for in this respect the property <lb/>
            will be well laid down, thus since neither body denotes many <lb/>
            things, nor that which is most easily moved to an upward <lb/>
            place, nor the whole composed of these, according to this, a <lb/>
            body which is most easily moved to an upward place would <lb/>
            be well assigned as the property of fire.</p>
          <p>3. Also if <lb/>
            there is a mul­ <lb/>
            tifarious pre­ <lb/>
            dication of the <lb/>
            subject.</p>
          <p>In the next place, we subvert it if that is mul­ <lb/>
            tifariously predicated, of which they assign the <lb/>
            property, yet it is not defined, of which of them <lb/>
            the property is laid down, for the property (thus), <lb/>
            will not be well assigned. On account of what reason is not <lb/>
            obscure from what has been before said, for the same things <lb/>
            must necessarily result, for instance, since to know this thing <lb/>
            scientifically, signifies many things, (viz. that this possesses <lb/>
            science and that it uses science, and that there is a science of <lb/>
            it, and that we use the science of it,) the property of scienti­ <lb/>
            fically knowing this thing, would not be well assigned when <lb/>
            it is not defined, of which of them, the property is laid down. <lb/>
            We confirm it, however, if that of which the property is placed, <lb/>
            be not multifariously predicated, but is one and simple, for as <lb/>
            to this, the property will be well laid down, for instance, since <lb/>
            man is predicated as one thing, it would be well laid down as <lb/>
            to this, that the property of man (consisted in his being) an <lb/>
            animal naturally mild.</p>
          <p>4. Also if there <lb/>
            be frequent <lb/>
            repetition.</p>
          <p>Again, we subvert it, it the same thing has tre­ <lb/>
            quently been mentioned in the property, for often­ <lb/>
            times it escapes notice when men do this, as well <lb/>
            in properties as in definitions. Now the property of this kind <lb/>
            will not be well laid down, for the frequent repetition disturbs <lb/>
            the hearer, so that obscurity necessarily arises, and besides <lb/>
            this men seem loquacious. Still it will happen that the same <lb/>
            "-thing is frequently repeated in two modes, the one, when we <lb/>
            often denominate the same, as if any one assigned the pro­ <lb/>
            perty of fire to be a body the most subtle of all bodies, (for <lb/>
            he repeats the word body,) and in the second place, if a man <lb/>
            assumes definitions instead of names, as if he should give as <lb/>
            the property of earth, that it was an essence which, most of <lb/>
            all bodies, naturally tends to a downward place, and should <lb/>
            afterwards assume, instead of (the word) bodies, such <pb n="447"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. II.]"/><lb/>
            essences, for body and such an essence are one and the same <lb/>
            thing, so that he will repeat the word essence, and neither of <lb/>
            the properties would be well placed. We confirm it, indeed, <lb/>
            if no one and the same name be frequently used, for as to this <lb/>
            the property will be well assigned, e. g. since he who says, the <lb/>
            property of man is an animal capable of science, does not <lb/>
            frequently employ the same name, in this respect the property <lb/>
            of man would be well assigned.</p>
          <p>Next, property is subverted, if such a name is <lb/>
            assigned in the property as is present with all, for <lb/>
            that will be useless which is not separated from <lb/>
            some, but what is asserted in properties, we ought <lb/>
            5. Also if that <lb/>
            be in the pro­ <lb/>
            perty, which is <lb/>
            common to all. <lb/>
            to separate, as also in definitions, wherefore, the property <lb/>
            will not be well stated. Thus, since he who assigns as the <lb/>
            property of science, opinion immutable by reason, being one, <lb/>
            uses a certain such thing in property, viz. one which is pre­ <lb/>
            sent with all, the property of science would not be well stated; <lb/>
            on the other hand we confirm it, if no common term has <lb/>
            been used, but one separating from a certain thing, for in this <lb/>
            respect the property would be well stated, thus, since he who <lb/>
            says the property of animal is to have a soul, uses no common <lb/>
            (term), in this respect it would be well laid down, as the pro­ <lb/>
            perty of animal, that it possesses a soul. More­ <lb/>
            over it is subverted, if a person assign many <lb/>
            properties of the same thing, not distinguishing <lb/>
            that he assigns many, for the property will not <lb/>
            be well placed. For as in definitions it is not <lb/>
            6. If many <lb/>
            properties are <lb/>
            assigned of the <lb/>
            same thing, <lb/>
            without dis­ <lb/>
            tinction. <lb/>
            requisite that any thing more should be added, than the sen­ <lb/>
            tence denoting the essence, so neither in properties should <lb/>
            any thing be added, besides the sentence which constitutes <lb/>
            what is asserted to be the property, since a thing of this kind <lb/>
            is useless. Thus, since he who states that the property of <lb/>
            fire is to be a body of the greatest subtlety and lightness, <lb/>
            assigns many properties, (for it is true) to assert each of fire <lb/>
            alone, it would not be well laid down as the property of fire <lb/>
            to be a body, most subtle and most light. On the other hand, <lb/>
            he confirms property who has not assigned many properties, <lb/>
            but one of the same thing, for as to this, the property will be <lb/>
            well stated, thus, since he who says that the property of mois­ <lb/>
            ture is a body which can be brought to every shape, assigns <lb/>
             <pb n="448"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK V."/>one property and not many, in this respect property of mois­ <lb/>
            ture would be well stated.</p>

            learning; the same thing therefore is similarly unknown with <lb/>
            itself, but what is the subject of a certain thing is posterior <lb/>
            to it, and therefore is not more known. Hence, through these, <lb/>
            greater instruction in any thing does not happen, e. g. since <lb/>
            he who states the property of animal, to be a substance, a <lb/>
            species of which is man, uses some one of the subjects of this <lb/>
            (animal), the property would not be well stated. But the <lb/>
            confirmer (must observe) if he uses neither it, nor any of its <lb/>
            subjects, for in this respect, property will be well stated; <lb/>
            thus, since he who lays down the property of animal, to be <lb/>
            composed of soul and body neither uses it, nor any of its <lb/>
            subjects, the property of animal, with regard to this, would <lb/>
            be well assigned.</p>
          <p>2. Also whe­ <lb/>
            ther the oppo­ <lb/>
            site to the <lb/>
            thing itself, or <lb/>
            what is less <lb/>
            clear than the <lb/>
            latter, be taken <lb/>
            as the property.</p>
          <p>In the same manner, also, consideration must <lb/>
            be paid as to the other things which do not, or <lb/>
            which do render, a thing more known, subverting, <lb/>
            indeed, if what is opposite is used, or in short, <lb/>
            what is simultaneous in nature, or any thing pos­ <lb/>
            terior, for the property will not be well stated. <lb/>
            W hat is opposite is indeed simultaneous in nature, but what <lb/>
            is simultaneous in nature and what is posterior, do not render <lb/>
            a thing more known. For instance, since he who states the <lb/>
            property of good, to be that which is especially opposed to <lb/>
            evil, uses the opposite of good, the property of good would <lb/>
            not be well assigned. On the other hand, we confirm it if <lb/>
            nothing opposite is used, nor, in short, what is simultaneous <lb/>
            in nature, nor what is posterior, for as to this, the property <lb/>
            will be well assigned; e. g. since he who lays down the pro­ <lb/>
            perty of knowledge, to be a notion in the highest degree <lb/>
            credible, uses neither an opposite, nor what is simultaneous <pb n="449"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. III.]"/> <lb/>
            in nature, nor what is posterior, so far as regards this, the <lb/>
            property of knowledge would be well stated.</p>
          <p>We next subvert peculiarity, indeed, if what <lb/>
            does not always follow, has been assigned as <lb/>
            the property, but that which sometimes hap­ <lb/>
            pens not to be property, for the property will not <lb/>
            S. Also whether <lb/>
            that is assigned, <lb/>
            which is not <lb/>
            always joined <lb/>
            to the thing. <lb/>
            be well explained: since neither will the name even be <lb/>
            necessarily verified, in respect of that in which we apprehend <lb/>
            its being inherent, nor of what it is apprehended not to be <lb/>
            inherent, will the name necessarily not be as­ <lb/>
            serted of this.- Further, besides these, neither <lb/>
            when the property is assigned, will it be clear <lb/>
            whether it is inherent, if it is a thing of that kind <lb/>
            as to fail, therefore the property will not be clear; <lb/>
            * " Hence the <lb/>
            peculiarity will <lb/>
            not be well <lb/>
            posited "-in­ <lb/>
            serted by Tay­ <lb/>
            lor and Buhle. <lb/>
            e. g. since he who places the property of animal sometimes <lb/>
            to be moved and to stand still, has assigned a property which <lb/>
            is sometimes not a property, the latter would not be well laid <lb/>
            down. On the other hand, it is confirmed, if that is assigned <lb/>
            which is necessarily always a property, for in this respect <lb/>
            the property would be well stated, since he who asserts the <lb/>
            property of virtue to be that which makes its possessor a worthy <lb/>
            man, assigns that which always follows as a property, so far <lb/>
            as regards this, the property of virtue would be well assigned.</p>
          <p>In the next place, it is subverted if some one <lb/>
            assigning that which is now a property, does not <lb/>
            declare that he assigns what is now a property, <lb/>
            since the property will not be well stated. For, <lb/>
            first, every thing which is contrary to custom re- <lb/>
            4. Also whe­ <lb/>
            ther the as­ <lb/>
            signer of a pre­ <lb/>
            sent property, <lb/>
            oes not dis­ <lb/>
            tinguish time. <lb/>
            quires explanation, and for the most part, all men are accus­ <lb/>
            tomed to assign as property that which is always conse­ <lb/>
            quent ; secondly, he is uncertain who does not explain whether <lb/>
            he desired to state that which is now property, wherefore a <lb/>
            pretext of reproof must not be given. For instance, since he <lb/>
            who states the property of a certain man, is to sit with a <lb/>
            certain man, lays down that which is now a property ; he would <lb/>
            not place the property well, if he did not speak with explapa­ <lb/>
            tion. Nevertheless, he confirms it if, assigning what is pro­ <lb/>
            perty at present, he explains that he adduces the present pro­ <lb/>
            perty, for in this respect the property will be well stated; <lb/>
            thus, since he who asserts the property of a certain man to be <note type="footnote"> 2 o </note> <pb n="450"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK V."/>his walking now, asserts this with a distinction, the property <lb/>
            would be well alleged.</p>
          <p>5. Whether <lb/>
            what is only <lb/>
            evident by <lb/>
            sense, is as­ <lb/>
            signed.</p>
          <p>Next, it is subverted if such a property is as­ <lb/>
            signed, which is in no other way evident to be <lb/>
            inherent than by sense, since the property will <lb/>
            not be well placed; for every thing sensible, when <lb/>
            it is external to sense becomes obscure, since it is not ap­ <lb/>
            parent whether it is still inherent, because of its only being <lb/>
            known by sense. This, indeed, would be true in those things <lb/>
            which do not always follow from necessity.1 For example, <lb/>
            since he who asserts the property of the sun to be the most <lb/>
            splendid star moved above the earth, uses such (an expres­ <lb/>
            sion) in the property, to be moved above the earth, which is <lb/>
            known by sense, the property of the sun would not be well <lb/>
            assigned, for it would be doubtful when the sun sets, whether <lb/>
            it is moved above the earth, because of sense then failing us. <lb/>
            Property, however, is confirmed if such a kind has been given, <lb/>
            as is not evident to sense, or which, being sensible, is mani­ <lb/>
            festly inherent of necessity, for in this respect the property <lb/>
            will be well stated. Thus, since he who lays down, as the <lb/>
            property of superficies, to be that which is first coloured, uses, <lb/>
            indeed, something sensible, viz. to be coloured, but of such a <lb/>
            kind as is evidently always inherent, in this respect the pro­ <lb/>
            perty of superficies would be well assigned.</p>
          <p>6. Whether de­ <lb/>
            finition is as­ <lb/>
            signed as pro­ <lb/>
            perty.</p>
          <p>Next, it is subverted if definition is assigned <lb/>
            as property, for the property will not be well <lb/>
            stated, since it ought not to manifest the very <lb/>
            nature of a thing ; e. g. since he who says the <lb/>
            property of man is to be an animal pedestrian biped, assigns <lb/>
            as the property of man that which signifies his very nature, <lb/>
            the property of man would not be well assigned. But we <lb/>
            confirm it if a property which reciprocates is assigned, yet <lb/>
            which does not manifest the very nature of a thing, since in <lb/>
            this respect the property would be well assigned; e. g. since <lb/>
            he who states the property of man to be an animal naturally <lb/>
            mild, assigns a property which reciprocates indeed, yet does <lb/>
            not manifest the very nature of man, in this respect the pro­ <lb/>
            perty of man would be well assigned. <note type="footnote"> I See the note of Waitz on this passage. </note></p><pb n="451"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. IV.]"/>
          <p>Moreover, it is subverted, if he who assigns the <lb/>
            property, does not assert what a thing is, since it <lb/>
            is necessary with properties, as with definitions, to <lb/>
            assign the first genus, next, to add what remains, <lb/>
            and to separate.✹ Hence, the property which is <lb/>
            not placed after this manner would not be well <lb/>
            assigned; thus, since he who asserts that the pro- <lb/>
            7. Whether it <lb/>
            does not neces­ <lb/>
            sarily consist <lb/>
            with the very <lb/>
            nature of a <lb/>
            thing. <lb/>
            * i. e. the thing <lb/>
            proposed from <lb/>
            other things. <lb/>
            perty of animal is to have a soul, does not state what an ani­ <lb/>
            mal is, the property of animal would not be well laid down. <lb/>
            Again, we confirm it, if any one, asserting what that is of <lb/>
            which he assigns the property, annexes what remains, for in <lb/>
            this respect the property will be well assigned ; thus, since he <lb/>
            who asserts the property of man to be an animal <lb/>
            susceptible of science, by asserting what man is, <lb/>
            assigns his property, in this respect, the property <lb/>
            of man would be well assigned. t</p>

          </ab>
          <p>WHETHER, however, what is assigned as property, be so well, <lb/>
            or ill, must be examined from such (places), but whether what <lb/>
            is stated be altogether property or not property, must be in­ <lb/>
            spected from these. For those which simply confirm that the <lb/>
            property is well stated, will be the same places as those which <lb/>
            produce property at all, therefore they will be explained with <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>First then in confirmation, we must regard <lb/>
            each particular, of which the property has been <lb/>
            assigned, as whether it is present with no indi­ <lb/>
            vidual, or is not verified in this respect, or whe­ <lb/>
            ther it is not the property of each of them, as re- <lb/>
            1. The assign­ <lb/>
            ed is not pro­ <lb/>
            perty, if it does <lb/>
            not concur <lb/>
            with each indi­ <lb/>
            vidual. <lb/>
            gards that of which the property has been assigned, for the <lb/>
            property will not be that which was laid down as the property. <lb/>
            For instance, since it is not truly asserted of a geometrician <lb/>
            that he cannot be deceived by argument, (for a geometrician <lb/>
            is deceived when there is made a false description,) it would <note type="footnote"> I After explaining how it may be known, whether property be well ex­ <lb/>
            pressed, he now discusses the topics, of deciding whether that assigned be <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK V."/>not be the property of a scientific man, not to be deceived by <lb/>
            argument. It is confirmed, on the other hand, if it is verified <lb/>
            of every thing, and is true as regards this, for that will be <lb/>
            property which was stated not to be property; e. g. since an <lb/>
            animal capable of science is verified of every man, and so far <lb/>
            as he is man, an animal capable of science would be the pro­ <lb/>
            perty of man. This place indeed is for subversion, if a sen­ <lb/>
            tence is not verified of what the name is verified, and if of <lb/>
            what the sentence is verified the name is not verified, but it <lb/>
            belongs to confirmation, if of what the name, the sentence also <lb/>
            is verified, and if of what a sentence is predicated, a name <lb/>
            also is.</p>
          <p>2. Also if the <lb/>
            name is not <lb/>
            verified of what <lb/>
            the sentence is, <lb/>
            and vice versâ.</p>
          <p>In the next place, we subvert it, if, of what the <lb/>
            sentence is, the name also is not verified, and if, of <lb/>
            what the name is spoken, the sentence is not, since <lb/>
            what is stated to be property, will not be property. <lb/>
            For example, since animal partaking of science is verified of <lb/>
            God, but man is not predicated, animal partaking of science <lb/>
            would not be the property of man. But we confirm it, if, of <lb/>
            what the sentence is, the name also is predicated, and if, of <lb/>
            what the name, the sentence also is predicated, since that will <lb/>
            be property which was stated not to be so; thus, since animal <lb/>
            is verified of that of which the possession of a soul is, and the <lb/>
            possession of a soul of that of which animal is, the possession <lb/>
            of a soul would be the property of animal.</p>
          <p>3. If the sub­ <lb/>
            ject is assigned <lb/>
            as the property.</p>
          <p>Again, it is subverted, if the subject is assigned <lb/>
            as the property of what is stated in the subject, <lb/>
            since that will not be property which is stated to <lb/>
            be so ; e. g. since he who asserts the property of body, consist­ <lb/>
            ing of the most subtle parts, is fire, assigns the subject1 as the <lb/>
            property of that which is predicated,2 fire would not be the <lb/>
            property of a body of the most subtle parts. Wherefore the <lb/>
            subject will not be the property of that which is in the sub­ <lb/>
            ject, because the same thing will be the property of many <lb/>
            things specifically different, since many things differing in <lb/>
            species are present with the same, being predicated of it alone, <lb/>
            the property of all which, will be the subject, if a person thus <lb/>
            places the property. Again, property is confirmed if that <lb/>
            which is in the subject is assigned as the property of the sub- <note type="footnote"> 1 i. e. fire. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 i. e. of a body consisting of most subtle parts. </note> <pb n="453"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. IV.]"/>ject, for that will be property which was stated not to be so, <lb/>
            if it is predicated of those alone of which it is said to be the <lb/>
            property; thus, since he who says that the property of earth, <lb/>
            is body specifically the heaviest, assigns the property of the <lb/>
            subject which is predicated of that thing alone, and as a pro­ <lb/>
            perty, the property of earth would be rightly stated.</p>
          <p>We next subvert it, if the property is assigned <lb/>
            according to participation, for that will not be <lb/>
            property which was stated to be so, since what is <lb/>
            present according to participation, belongs to the <lb/>
            very nature of a thing, but this sort would be a <lb/>
            4. If that Is as­ <lb/>
            signed as a pro­ <lb/>
            perty, which <lb/>
            the thing par­ <lb/>
            takes of, as a <lb/>
            difference. <lb/>
            certain difference predicated of some one species: thus, since <lb/>
            he who says the property of man is a pedestrian biped, as­ <lb/>
            signs the property according to participation, pedestrian biped <lb/>
            would not be the property of man. We confirm, on the con­ <lb/>
            trary, if the property is not assigned according to participa­ <lb/>
            tion, nor manifests the very nature when the thing recipro­ <lb/>
            cates, for that will be property which is stated not to be <lb/>
            property; thus, since he who places the property of animal, as <lb/>
            naturally to possess sensation, neither assigns property ae­ <lb/>
            cording to participation, nor manifests the very nature, the <lb/>
            thing itself reciprocating with it, naturally to possess sensation, <lb/>
            would be the property of animal.</p>
          <p>Again, we subvert it, if the property cannot be <lb/>
            at the same time inherent, but either subsequent <lb/>
            or prior to, that of which it is the name, for what <lb/>
            is stated to be property, will not be so, either <lb/>
            5. Or if that <lb/>
            which is by na­ <lb/>
            ture prior, or <lb/>
            posterior, to the <lb/>
            thing itself. <lb/>
            never, or not always: thus, since it is possible for walking <lb/>
            through the forum, to be present with some one, both prior <lb/>
            and subsequent to its being man, walking through the forum <lb/>
            would not be the property of man, either never, or not always. <lb/>
            We confirm it however, if it is always present from necessity <lb/>
            at the same time, being neither definition nor difference, since <lb/>
            that will be property which was stated not to be so; thus, <lb/>
            since animal capable of science, and man, always exist neces­ <lb/>
            sarily at one and the same time, being neither difference nor <lb/>
            definition, animal susceptible of science, would be the pro­ <lb/>
            perty of man.</p>
          <p>Moreover, we subvert it, if the same thing is not <lb/>
            the property of the same things, so far as they are <lb/>
            the same, since that will not be property which is <lb/>
            6. Or if the <lb/>
            same thing be <lb/>
            not the pro­ <lb/>
            perty of the <pb n="454"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK V."/>same things, so <lb/>
            far as they are <lb/>
            the same. <lb/>
            stated to be so; thus, since it is not the property <lb/>
            of what is the object of pursuit, to appear good to <lb/>
            certain persons, the latter would not be the pro­ <lb/>
            perty of the eligible, for what is the object of pursuit, and the <lb/>
            eligible, are the same thing. But it is confirmed, if the same <lb/>
            is the property of the same, so far as it is the same, since that <lb/>
            will be property which is stated not to be so: thus, since of <lb/>
            * Do Anim. iiL <lb/>
            9,2. <lb/>
            man, so far as he is man, the possession of a tri­ <lb/>
            partite soul is said to be the property; * the pos­ <lb/>
            session of this, would also be the property of <lb/>
            mortal, so far as mortal. Now this place is likewise useful <lb/>
            for accident, since it is necessary that the same things should <lb/>
            be or not be present, with the same things, so far as they are <lb/>
            the same.</p>
          <p>7. If of things <lb/>
            the same in <lb/>
            species,the pro­ <lb/>
            perty is not al­ <lb/>
            ways specific­ <lb/>
            ally the same.</p>
          <p>Again, we subvert, if of things the same in <lb/>
            species, the property is not always the same in <lb/>
            species, since neither will what is stated be the <lb/>
            property of the thing proposed ; thus, since man <lb/>
            and horse are the same in species, but it is not <lb/>
            always the property of a horse to stand from himself, neither <lb/>
            will it be the property of man to be moved from himself, since <lb/>
            to be moved and to stand from self are the same in species, <lb/>
            and happen to each of these, so far as he is animal. On the <lb/>
            other hand, we confirm it, if of what are the same in species <lb/>
            the property is always the same, for that will be property <lb/>
            which is stated not to be so; thus, since it is the property of <lb/>
            man to be a pedestrian biped, it would also be the property <lb/>
            of bird to be a winged biped, since each of these is specifically <lb/>
            t i. e. man and <lb/>
            bird. <lb/>
            t i. e. pedes­ <lb/>
            trian and wing­ <lb/>
            ed. <lb/>
            the same, so far as somey are as species under <lb/>
            the same genus, being under animal, but others ‡ <lb/>
            are as differences of the genus, animal. Now this <lb/>
            place indeed is false, when one of those mentioned <lb/>
            is present with one species alone, but the other with many, <lb/>
            as a pedestrian quadruped.1</p>
          <p>8. If what is <lb/>
            the property of</p>
          <p>Since however "same and “different” are <lb/>
            multifariously predicated, it is difficult, when they <note type="footnote"> I For although horse and man are in the same species (animal), yet <lb/>

            same species) does not express the property of a horse; since there are <lb/>
            many other quadrupeds besides a horse. </note> <pb n="455"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. V.]"/>are sophistically assumed, to assign the property <lb/>
            of some one thing alone; for what is present with <lb/>
            something to which any thing happens, will also <lb/>
            be present with the accident assumed together <lb/>
            the subject <lb/>
            alone, be not so <lb/>
            of it,when join­ <lb/>
            ed to accident. <lb/>
            and vice versi. <lb/>
            with that, to which it is accidental; thus, what is present with <lb/>
            man, will also be with white man, if man is white, and what <lb/>
            is with white man, will also be with man. Some one however <lb/>
            may find fault with many of these properties, if he makes one <lb/>
            subject subsistent per se, but another with accident, as if he <lb/>
            stated man to be one thing, but white man another, moreover, <lb/>
            making the habit another, and that which is enunciated ac­ <lb/>
            cording to the habit. For what is present with habit will <lb/>
            also be present with what is denominated according to habit, <lb/>
            and what is present with that denominated according to habit, <lb/>
            will also be present with habit. Thus, since he who pos­ <lb/>
            sesses science is said to be scientifically disposed, the property <lb/>
            of science would not be the being immutable in opinion by <lb/>
            reason, for the man of science will be unpersuadable by rea­ <lb/>
            son. In confirmation however it must be stated, that that to <lb/>
            which a thing happens, and the accident taken together with <lb/>
            that to which it is accidental, are not different simply, but they <lb/>
            are said to be so from their essence being different, since it is <lb/>
            not the same thing for man to be man, and for a white man to <lb/>
            be a white man.1 Besides, we must inspect cases, stating that <lb/>
            neither will he be scientific, who is (a thing) unpersuadable by <lb/>
            reason, but he who is unpersuadable by reason, nor is science <lb/>
            that which cannot be induced to change its opinion by reason, <lb/>
            but the being unchangeable by reason,✹ for he <lb/>
            who in every way objects, must in every way be <lb/>
            opposed.2 <lb/>

          <p>PROPERTY is, in the next place, subverted, if he <lb/>
            who wishes to assign what is naturally inherent, <lb/>
            1. Observe <lb/>
            whether for <lb/>
            that which is <note type="footnote">I If a person wish to prove the property identical of " a man " and of <lb/>
            " a white man," he must state that one is not different from the other <lb/>
            simply, but only in a certain respect, so that their property may really be <lb/>
            the same. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The force of this observation is better conveyed in Latin, as by <lb/>
            Buhle, " Dicendum est neque scientem esse ratione immutabile, sed rations <lb/>
            immutabilem: neque scientiam esse ratione immutabile, sed ratione im­ <lb/>
            mutabilem. </note> <pb n="456"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK V."/>always the pro­ <lb/>
            perty, some­ <lb/>
            thing be as­ <lb/>
            sumed which is <lb/>
            Joined to the <lb/>
            very nature of <lb/>
            a thing. <lb/>
            places it after that manner in his discourse, as to <lb/>
            signify what is always inherent, since he will seem <lb/>
            to have subverted that, which was stated to be <lb/>
            the property. Thus, since he who says that the <lb/>
            property of man is to be a biped, wishes to assign <lb/>
            what is naturally inherent indeed, but signifies in the enun­ <lb/>
            ciation what is always inherent, biped would not be the <lb/>
            property of man, since not every man has two feet. On the <lb/>
            other hand, he confirms it, if he desires to assign the property <lb/>
            which is naturally inherent, and signifies it after this manner <lb/>
            in his speech, for as to this, property will not be subverted. <lb/>
            Thus, since he who assigns the property of man, to be an <lb/>
            animal susceptible of science, both desires and also signifies <lb/>
            in speech, the property which is naturally inherent, it would <lb/>
            not, as regards this, be subverted, as that an animal suscepti* <lb/>
            ble of science is not the property of man.</p>
          <p>2. Whether <lb/>
            that whose <lb/>
            property is as­ <lb/>
            signed, be pre­ <lb/>
            dicated of some <lb/>
            other first, or <lb/>
            another of itself <lb/>
            as first.</p>
          <p>Besides, with regard to such things as are enun­ <lb/>
            ciated, as to some other first, or as that which <lb/>
            is itself first, (i. e. per se,) it is difficult to assign the <lb/>
            property of such as these; for if you assign the <lb/>
            property of what is through something else, it <lb/>
            will also be verified in respect of what is first, but <lb/>
            if you assign the property of the first, it will also be predi­ <lb/>
            cated of that which subsists according to something else. <lb/>
            Thus, if some one asserts the property of superficies to be <lb/>
            coloured, to be coloured will also be verified of body, but if <lb/>
            of body, it will also be predicated of superficies; so that of <lb/>
            what a sentence is verified, a name is not also verified.1</p>
          <p>3. Whether the <lb/>
            manner and <lb/>
            subject of the <lb/>
            property be <lb/>
            accurately <lb/>
            defined.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, it happens with some properties, <lb/>
            that an error for the most part happens from the <lb/>
            want of definition, as to how and of what things <lb/>
            the property is assigned. For all men endeavour <lb/>
            to assign property, either as what is naturally in­ <lb/>
            herent, as biped of man, or as what is (merely) inherent, as of <lb/>
            a certain man to have four fingers, or as in species, as of fire <lb/>
            that which is most subtle, or simply, as of animal to live, or <lb/>
            through another, as of soul to be wise, or as the first, as of the <lb/>
            reasoning faculty to possess prudence, or as in having, as of <lb/>
            the scientific to be unconvincible by argument, (for to be un­ <lb/>
            convincible in argument will be nothing else than to have <note type="footnote"> 1 See Waitz. </note> <pb n="457"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. V.]"/>something,*) or from being had, as of science, the <lb/>
            being unchanged by reason, or from being parti­ <lb/>
            cipated, as sensation, by animal, (since something <lb/>
            * viz. a firm <lb/>
            and constant <lb/>
            opinion. <lb/>
            else also has sensation as man, but he perceives because he is <lb/>
            a participant of animal,) or in consequence of participating, <lb/>
            as of a certain animal to live. He errs, therefore, who does <lb/>
            not add the word naturally, because what is naturally inherent, <lb/>
            it is possible may not be inherent in that, to which it is na­ <lb/>
            tural to be inherent, as in a man to have two feet. He, how­ <lb/>
            ever, who does not distinguish that he assigns what is in. <lb/>
            lierent (errs), because a thing will not be such sometimes <lb/>
            as it is now, † as for man to have four fingers, but <lb/>
            he errs who does not show that he assigns it, as <lb/>
            what is first, or as through something else, because <lb/>
            t So Bekker, <lb/>
            Taylor, and <lb/>
            Buhle. <lb/>
            the name will not be verified of that, of which the definition <lb/>
            is, as to be coloured, whether it is assigned as the property of <lb/>
            superficies or of body. He, again, who does not previously <lb/>
            declare that he assigns property, either from having, or from <lb/>
            being had, (errs,) because it will not be property, for it will <lb/>
            be inherent, if he assign the property from being had, in <lb/>
            that which has, but if from having, in that which is had, as <lb/>
            the being unconvincible by reason being laid down as the <lb/>
            property of science, or of the scientific man. He, again, who <lb/>
            does not, besides, signify (that he assigns property), from a <lb/>
            thing partaking or being partaken of, (errs,) because the pro­ <lb/>
            perty will be present with certain other things also ; if, indeed, <lb/>
            he assign it from being partaken of, it will be present with <lb/>
            those partaking it, but if from its partaking, with those which <lb/>
            are partaken of, as if to live should be placed as the property <lb/>
            of some certain animal, or of animal. (Again he errs), who <lb/>
            does not distinguish (that the property is assigned) in species, <lb/>
            because it will be present with one thing alone, of those which <lb/>
            are under this, of which he assigns the property, for what ex­ <lb/>
            ists according to excess is present with one thing alone; as of <lb/>
            fire, that which is most light. Sometimes, indeed, he who adds <lb/>
            the expression "in species" errs, for it will be necessary that <lb/>
            there should be one species of the things stated, when the words <lb/>
            "in species" are added, but this does not occur in some things, <lb/>
            as neither in fire, for there is not one species of fire, since a <lb/>
            burning coal, flame, and light, each of them being fire, are <lb/>
            specifically different. For this reason, there is no necessity, <pb n="458"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK V."/>when the words " in species” are added, that there should be <lb/>
            another species of what is stated, because what is assigned as <lb/>
            property will be more present with some, but less with others, <lb/>
            as of fire that which is most subtle, for light is more subtle <lb/>
            than a burning coal, and than flame. Nevertheless, this ought <lb/>
            not to happen, when the name is not more predicated of that, <lb/>
            of which the sentence is more verified,1 for otherwise it will <lb/>
            not be (true), that of what the sentence is more, the name is <lb/>
            also more (predicated.) Moreover, besides these, the same <lb/>
            thing will happen to be the property of what is simply, and <lb/>
            of what is especially; in what is simply, as the most subtle <lb/>
            happens in the case of fire, for this very thing will be pro­ <lb/>
            perty of light also, since light is most subtle. If, therefore, <lb/>
            another person should thus assign property, we must argue, but <lb/>
            he must not yield to this objection, but straightway, when the <lb/>
            property is assigned, define the manner in which he assigns it.</p>
          <p>4. If the thing <lb/>
            itself be as­ <lb/>
            signed as its <lb/>
            own property. <lb/>
            (Cf. Hill's Lo­ <lb/>
            gic; Mansel's <lb/>
            Appendix.)</p>
          <p>In the next place, property is subverted if a <lb/>
            thing is assigned as the property of itself, for <lb/>
            what is stated to be, will not be property, since <lb/>
            every thing which is the same with a thing, mani­ <lb/>
            fests essence, but that which manifests essence is <lb/>
            not property, but definition; thus, since he who <lb/>
            says that the becoming, is a property of good, assigns that <lb/>
            which is the property of itself, (for the good and the becoming <lb/>
            are the same,) the becoming, would not be the property of the <lb/>
            good. On the other hand, we confirm it, if the same is not <lb/>
            assigned as the property of itself, but that which reciprocates <lb/>
            is laid down, for what is stated not to be, will be property; <lb/>
            e. g. since he who asserts the property of animal is animated <lb/>
            substance, does not lay down the same thing as the property <lb/>
            of itself, but assigns what reciprocates, animated substance <lb/>
            would be the property of animal.</p>
          <p>5. Whether in <lb/>
            those things <lb/>
            which consist <lb/>
            ofsimilarparts, <lb/>
            the property of <lb/>
            a part, or of the <lb/>
            whole, be laid <lb/>
            down.</p>
          <p>Next, we must consider this in the case of <lb/>
            those which consist of similar parts, the subvertor <lb/>
            indeed whether the property of the whole is not <lb/>
            verified of the part, or whether the property of <lb/>
            the part is not predicated of the whole, since <lb/>
            what is stated to be. will not be property. In <lb/>
            some things indeed this occurs, as a man may assign pro- <note type="footnote"> 1 o <foreign xml:lang="grc">λόγος</foreign>, that which expresses the property of the thing: TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄνομα</foreign>, <lb/>
            the thing whose property is expressed. </note> <pb n="459"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. VI"/>perty in things of similar parts, sometimes looking to the <lb/>
            whole, and sometimes directing his attention to what is enun­ <lb/>
            ciated according to a part, yet neither will be rightly assigned. <lb/>
            For instance, in the whole of thing; since he who states the <lb/>
            property of the sea is an abundance of salt water, introduces <lb/>
            the property of a certain thing, consisting of similar parts, but <lb/>
            assigns such as is not verified of a part, (for a certain sea does <lb/>
            not abound with salt water,) the property of the sea would <lb/>
            not be an abundance of salt water. Again, in the case of a <lb/>
            part, e. g. since he who states the property of air to be the <lb/>
            respirable, asserts the property of a certain thing of similar <lb/>
            parts, but assigns such a thing as is verified of a certain air, <lb/>
            but is not spoken of all air, (for all is not respirable,) the re­ <lb/>
            spirable would not be the property of air. Now he who con­ <lb/>
            firms, (must see) whether of each of the things consisting of <lb/>
            similar parts, that is verified, which is the property of them <lb/>
            according to the whole, since what is stated not to be, will be <lb/>
            property: thus, since it is verified of all earth to tend na­ <lb/>
            turally downward, and this is the property of certain earth <lb/>
            according to earth, to tend naturally downward would be the <lb/>
            property of earth.</p>

          <p>WE must next consider from opposites; first, from <lb/>
            contraries, the subverter indeed whether the con­ <lb/>
            trary is not the property of the contrary, since a <lb/>
            contrary will not be the property of a contrary; <lb/>
            thus, since injustice is contrary to justice, but the <lb/>
            1. Observe <lb/>
            whether of op. <lb/>
            posites, the pro­ <lb/>
            perties be oppo­ <lb/>
            site—of contra­ <lb/>
            ries, contrary. <lb/>
            worst to the best, and the best is not the property of justice, <lb/>
            neither would the worst be the property of injustice. On the <lb/>
            other hand, the confirmer (must examine), whether the con­ <lb/>
            trary is the property of the contrary, for a contrary will be <lb/>
            the property of a contrary; thus, since evil is contrary to <lb/>
            good, and what is to be avoided to what is eligible, but the <lb/>
            property of good is the eligible, the property of evil would <lb/>
            be that which is to be avoided.</p>
          <p>Next, from relatives; the subverter indeed if <lb/>
            one relative is not the property of another rela- 2. Of relatives, relative <lb/>
            tive, for this relative will not be the property of <lb/>
            that relative; thus, since the double is spoken relatively to <pb n="460"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK V."/>tne half, and me exceeding to the exceeded, but me exceed­ <lb/>
            ing is not the property of the double, the exceeded would not <lb/>
            be the property of the half. It is confirmed however, if one <lb/>
            relative is the property of another, for this relative will be the <lb/>
            property of that; thus, since the double is spoken relatively to <lb/>
            the half, one indeed with relation to two, but two to one, and <lb/>
            the property of the double is as two to one, the property of <lb/>
            the half will be as one to two.</p>
          <p>3. Of habit and <lb/>
            privation.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, it is subverted, if what is predicated <lb/>
            according to habit is not the property of the <lb/>
            habit, since neither will what is predicated ac­ <lb/>
            cording to privation be the property of privation ; also if what <lb/>
            is predicated as to privation is not the property of privation, <lb/>
            neither will what is predicated as to habit be the property of <lb/>
            habit; thus, since privation of sense is not said to be the <lb/>
            property of deafness,1 neither would sensation be the pro­ <lb/>
            perty of hearing. Again, it is confirmed, if what is predi­ <lb/>
            cated according to habit is the property of habit, for what is <lb/>
            predicated as to privation will be also the property of priva­ <lb/>
            tion ; and if what is predicated as to privation is the property <lb/>
            of privation, what is predicated as to habit will be the pro­ <lb/>
            perty of habit. Thus, since it is the property of sight to see, <lb/>
            according as we possess sight, not to see, would be the pro­ <lb/>
            perty of blindness, according as we do not possess sight when <lb/>
            we are naturally adapted to have it.</p>
          <p>4. Of affirma­ <lb/>
            tives and nega­ <lb/>
            tives. <lb/>
            1. Whether <lb/>
            things repug­ <lb/>
            nant are as­ <lb/>
            signed as the <lb/>
            properties of <lb/>
            the same thing.</p>
          <p>Moreover, from affirmatives and negatives, and, <lb/>
            first, from the predicates themselves; but this <lb/>
            place is useful for the subverter only. Thus, if <lb/>
            affirmation, or what is predicated as to affirmation, <lb/>
            is the property of a thing, neither negation nor <lb/>
            what is predicated as to negation will be the pro­ <lb/>
            perty of it; but if negation, or what is predicated <lb/>
            according to negation, is its property, neither affirmation nor <lb/>
            what is predicated as to affirmation will be its property; thus, <lb/>
            since animated is the property of animal, what is not animated <lb/>
            will not be the property of animal. <note type="footnote"> I Because non convenit soli. Vide Aldrich's Logic. Taylor and Buhle <lb/>
            insert, (the latter in the Greek text itself,) “for this also is common to <lb/>
            other things, <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ γὰρ τῶν ἄλλων κοινόν</foreign>.” the theory of the neces­ <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. VI.]"/>
          <p>Secondly, from things predicated or not predi­ <lb/>
            cated, and of which they are predicated or not <lb/>
            predicated, subverting it indeed if affirmation is <lb/>
            not the property of affirmation; for neither will <lb/>
            negation be the property of negation, and if nega- <lb/>
            2. Or whether <lb/>
            things non-re­ <lb/>
            pugnant, be as­ <lb/>
            signed as pro­ <lb/>
            perties of re­ <lb/>
            pugnant sub­ <lb/>
            jects. <lb/>
            tion is n. t the property of negation, neither will affirmation <lb/>
            be the property of affirmation. Thus, since animal is not the <lb/>
            property of man, neither would what is not animal be the <lb/>
            property of what is not man, and if what is not animal ap­ <lb/>
            pears to be not the property of what is not man, neither will <lb/>
            animal be the property of man. We confirm it, on the con­ <lb/>
            trary, if affirmation is the property of affirmation, for nega­ <lb/>
            tion will also be the property of negation, and if negation is <lb/>
            the property of negation, affirmation also will be the property <lb/>
            of affirmation ; thus, since not to live is the property of what <lb/>
            is not animal, to live would be the property of animal; and if <lb/>
            to live appears the property of animal, not to live will appear <lb/>
            the property of what is not animal.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, from subjects themselves, subverting <lb/>
            indeed if the Assigned property is the property of <lb/>
            affirmation, since the same will not also be the <lb/>
            property of negation; but if what is assigned be <lb/>
            8. Whether the <lb/>
            same property <lb/>
            be assumed of <lb/>
            things repug­ <lb/>
            nant. <lb/>
            the property of negation, it will not be the property of affirma­ <lb/>
            tion ; thus, since the animated is the property of animal, the <lb/>
            animated would not be the property of what is not animal. <lb/>
            On the other hand confirming it, if the assigned be not the <lb/>
            property of affirmation, for it would be that of negation. This <lb/>
            place however is false, for affirmation is not the property of <lb/>
            negation, nor negation of affirmation, for affirmation is not <lb/>
            wholly present with negation, but negation is with affirmation, <lb/>
            yet is not present as a property.1</p>
          <p>Next, from things oppositely divided, subvert­ <lb/>
            ing indeed, if none of the oppositely divided is the <lb/>
            property of no one of the remaining oppositely <lb/>
            divided, since neither will what is stated, be the <lb/>
            property of that of which it is stated as the pro­ <lb/>
            perty ; thus, since sensible animal is the property <lb/>
            5. Whether of <lb/>
            things of the <lb/>
            same division, <lb/>
            properties are <lb/>
            assigned, so as <lb/>
            not to keep the <lb/>
            same order of <lb/>
            division. <lb/>
            of no other animal, intelligible animal would not be the pro­ <lb/>
            petty of God. Again, confirming it, if any one of the re­ <lb/>
            mainder oppositely divided, is the property of each of these <note type="footnote"> I Cf. Waltz in loc. </note> <pb n="462"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK V."/>✹ Taylor and <lb/>
            Buhle read dif­ <lb/>

            from Waitz and <lb/>
            Bekker. <lb/>
            which are oppositely divided for the remainder <lb/>
            will be the property of that of which it is stated <lb/>
            not to be the property; thus, since it is the pro­ <lb/>
            perty of prudence to be naturally per Be, the vir­ <lb/>
            tue of the reasoning part, and of each of the other virtues <lb/>
            thus assumed, the property of prudence would be, to be na­ <lb/>
            turally per se, the virtue of the appetitive part of the soul.</p>

            <title type="sub">CHAP. VII.—Of Property as to Cases.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. Whether <lb/>
            property is <lb/>
            rightly assign­ <lb/>
            ed, is known <lb/>
            from cases.</p>
          <p>IN the next place, from cases, subverting property <lb/>
            indeed if case is not the property of case, for nei­ <lb/>
            ther will one case be the property of the other; <lb/>
            thus. since what is beautifully is not the property <lb/>
            of what is justly, the beautiful would not be the property of <lb/>
            the just. On the other hand, confirming if case is the pro­ <lb/>
            perty of case, for the one case will be the property of the other; <lb/>
            thus, since pedestrian biped is the property of man (in the <lb/>
            nominative case, it would also be the property of man to be <lb/>
            † i. e. it would <lb/>
            be attributed <lb/>
            to man. <lb/>
            called pedestrian biped (in the dative case).t Not <lb/>
            only however must we observe cases in respect <lb/>
            of what has been stated, but also in opposites, <lb/>
            as was observed in the former places, subverting indeed <lb/>
            if the case of the opposite is not the property of the case of <lb/>
            the opposite, for neither will the case of one opposite be the <lb/>
            property of the case of another opposite; thus, since what is <lb/>
            well (done) is not the property of what is justly (done), nei­ <lb/>
            ther would be ill (done), the property of that which is done un­ <lb/>
            justly. Again, we confirm it, if the case of the opposite be the <lb/>
            property of the case of the opposite, for the case of this opposite <lb/>
            will be the property of the case of that opposite; thus, since best <lb/>
            is the property of good, worst would be the property of evil.</p>
          <p>2. From those <lb/>
            of similar sub­ <lb/>
            sistence.</p>
          <p>Next, from those which subsist similarly, sub­ <lb/>
            verting, indeed, if what subsists similarly is not <lb/>
            the property of what has similar subsistence, for <lb/>
            neither will what subsists similarly be the property of that <lb/>
            which has similar subsistence. Thus, since the builder of a <lb/>
            house subsists similarly with regard to building a house, as <lb/>
            the physician with regard to producing health, but it is not <lb/>
            the property of the physician to produce health, neither would <lb/>
            it be the property of the house-builder to produce a house. <pb n="463"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. VII.]"/>It is confirmed, however, if what subsists similarly is the <lb/>
            property of what has similar subsistence, for the similarly <lb/>
            subsisting will also be the property of what has similar sub­ <lb/>
            sistence; thus, since the physician subsists similarly with <lb/>
            regard to being effective of health, as the trainer of the gym­ <lb/>
            nasium to the being effective of a good habit of body, but the <lb/>
            being effective of a good habit of body is the property of the <lb/>
            trainer, to be effective of health would be the property of the <lb/>
            physician.</p>
          <p>Next, from those which subsist after the same <lb/>
            manner, subverting, indeed, if what subsists after <lb/>
            the same manner is not the property of what <lb/>
            3. From those <lb/>
            of the same <lb/>
            subsistence. <lb/>
            subsists after the same manner, for neither will what subsists <lb/>
            after the same manner be the property of what subsists after <lb/>
            the same manner, but if of that which subsists after the same <lb/>
            manner, that which subsists after the same manner, is the <lb/>
            property, it will not be the property of that thing of which it <lb/>
            is stated to be the property. Thus, since prudence subsists <lb/>
            after the same manner with regard to the honourable and the <lb/>
            base, from their being a science of each of them,. <lb/>
            but to be the science of the honourable is not the <lb/>
            property of prudence, it would not be the pro­ <lb/>
            * Cf. Ethics, <lb/>
            b. vi. ch. 5. <lb/>
            perty of prudence to be the science of the base, but if it is <lb/>
            the property of prudence to be the science of the honourable, <lb/>
            it would not be the property of it to be the science of the <lb/>
            base, since it is impossible that the same thing should be the <lb/>
            property of many. For him who confirms, indeed, this place <lb/>
            is of no use, for what subsists after the same manner is one <lb/>
            thing compared with many.1 <note type="footnote"> I A variety of opinions has been incident to the above passage. The <lb/>
            two most worthy of notice are those of Julius Pacius and Waitz. The <lb/>
            latter observes, " Ponamus notiones a et b eandem rationem habere ad <lb/>
            notionem A : quare si a non exprimit proprietatem notionis A, neque b <lb/>
            ejus proprietatem exprimere consequitur. Sin autem A proprium est <lb/>
            notion is a, non erit proprium notionis b, quum unum duorum proprium <lb/>
            esse nequeat." Pacius, contra, illustrates the passage thus : " Si A non <lb/>
            exprimit proprietatem notionis a, neque proprietatem notion is b exprimet: <lb/>
            sin autem A est proprium notionis a, non simul erit proprium notionis b, <lb/>
            quoniam non datur una duarum rerum proprietas." The difficulty has <lb/>
            arisen in the apparent contradiction of the statement to the example in <lb/>
            the text, and if Pacius’ view be adopted, the whole example must be con­ <lb/>
            sidered as interpolated: Waitz' interpretation, on the other hand, seems <lb/>
            to allow of the example emanating from AristotJe. </note></p><pb n="464"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK V."/>
          <p>f <lb/>
            From exist- <lb/>
            tence, produc­ <lb/>
            tionI and de­ <lb/>
            struction.</p>
          <p>Next, we subvert it, if what is said to exist is <lb/>
            not the property of what is said to exist, since <lb/>
            neither will to be corrupted be the property ot <lb/>
            that which is said to be corrupted, nor to be <lb/>
            generated of what is said to be generated. For instance, since <lb/>
            it is not the property of man to be animal, neither will to be <lb/>
            generated animal, be the property of to be generated man, nor <lb/>
            will the corruption of animal, be the property of the corrup­ <lb/>
            tion of man. After the same manner, we must assume (the <lb/>
            argument) from being generated to existence and being cor­ <lb/>
            rupted, and from being corrupted to existence and being <lb/>
            generated,1 as was just now said from existence, to the being <lb/>
            generated and corrupted. Again, we confirm it, if of what <lb/>
            is arranged according to existence, the property is that which <lb/>
            is arranged according to the same, for what is said to be ac­ <lb/>
            cording to the being generated, will also be the property of <lb/>
            what is said to be according to the being generated, and of <lb/>
            what is said to be corrupted that which is assigned accord <lb/>
            ing to this. Thus, since to be mortal is the property of man, <lb/>
            to be generated mortal would also be the property of the <lb/>
            being generated man, and the corruption of mortal of the <lb/>
            corruption of man. In the same way, indeed, we must take <lb/>
            the argument, both from the being generated and the being <lb/>
            corrupted with regard both to existence and to the same from <lb/>
            the same, as was observed to him who subverts.</p>
          <p>5. From ideas.</p>
          <p>Next, we must pay attention to the idea of the <lb/>
            thing proposed, subverting, indeed, if it be not <lb/>
            present with the idea, or if not as to this, according to which <lb/>
            that is stated, of which the property is a sign,2 for what is <lb/>
            stated to be, will not be the property. Thus, since rest is not <lb/>
            ✹<foreign xml:lang="grc">μὐτοανθρώπος</foreign>, <lb/>
            i. e. the idea <lb/>
            of man. <lb/>
            present with man himself,✹ so far as he is man, <lb/>
            but so far as he is idea,3 rest would not be the <lb/>
            property of man. We confirm it, indeed, if it is <lb/>
            present with the idea, and is present so far as it is predicated <lb/>
            of this very thing, of which it is stated not to be the pro- <note type="footnote"> I Taylor and Buhle insert <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτὰ ἐξ αὐτῶν</foreign>: the former remarks, " For <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>NEXT, from the more and less, first indeed sub­ <lb/>
            verting, if the more is not the property of the more, <lb/>
            for neither will the less be the property of the less, <lb/>
            nor the least of the least, nor the most of the most, <lb/>
            nor the simply of the simply. Thus, since to be <lb/>
            I. Whether <lb/>
            property is <lb/>
            rightly assign­ <lb/>
            ed, is known <lb/>
            from things ad. <lb/>
            mitting degree. <lb/>
            more coloured, is not the property of what is more body, <lb/>
            neither will to be less coloured, be the property of what is <lb/>
            less body, nor in short will to be coloured, be the property <lb/>
            of body. We confirm it however, if the more is the property <lb/>
            of the more, since the less also will be the property of the less, <lb/>
            and the least of the least, and the most of the most, and the <lb/>
            simply of the simply; for instance, since to perceive more, is <lb/>
            the property of what is more vital, to perceive less, would be <lb/>
            the property of the less vital, and the most of the most, the <lb/>
            least of the least, and the simply of the simply.</p>
          <p>From the simply too, the subverter must con­ <lb/>
            sider whether the simply is not the property of <lb/>
            the simply, for neither will the more be the pro­ <lb/>
            perty of the more, nor the less of the less, nor the <lb/>
            I. Topic of sub­ <lb/>
            version. <lb/>
            The simply of <lb/>
            the simply. <lb/>
            most of the most, nor the least of the least; thus, since it is <lb/>
            not the property of man to be worthy, neither would to be <lb/>
            more worthy, be the property of what is more man. The con­ <lb/>
            firmer however (must consider), whether what is simply is <lb/>
            the property of what is simply, for the more will be the property <lb/>
            of the more, the less also of the less, the least of the least, and <lb/>
            the most of the most; thus, since it is the property of fire <lb/>
            naturally to tend upwards, it would also be the property of <lb/>
            what is more fire naturally to tend more upwards, and in the <lb/>
            same manner we must direct attention from other things also, <lb/>
            to all these.</p>
          <p>Secondly, it is subverted, if the more is not the <lb/>
            property of the more, since neither will the less <lb/>
            be the property of the less; thus, since it is more <lb/>

            the more. <note type="footnote">2 H </note> <pb n="466"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK V."/>the property of animal to perceive, than of man to know, but <lb/>
            it is not the property of animal to perceive, it would not be the <lb/>
            property of man to know. We confirm it indeed, if the less <lb/>
            is the property of the less, for the more will also be the pro­ <lb/>
            perty of the more ; thus, since it is less the property of man to <lb/>
            be naturally mild than of animal to live, but it is the property <lb/>
            of man to be naturally mild, it would be the property of ani­ <lb/>
            mal to live.</p>
          <p>3. The rather <lb/>
            property.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, we subvert it, if it is not the property <lb/>
            of which it is more the property, since neither <lb/>
            will it be the property of that of which it is less <lb/>
            the property, but if it is the property of that, it will not be <lb/>
            the property of this. Thus, since to be coloured is more the <lb/>
            property of superficies than of body, but it is not the property <lb/>
            of superficies, neither would to be coloured be the property of <lb/>
            body ; if however it is the property of superficies, it would not <lb/>
            be the property of body. This place indeed is not useful to <lb/>
            the con firmer, since it is impossible that the same thing should <lb/>
            be the property of many.</p>
          <p>4. If the more <lb/>
            be not pro­ <lb/>
            perty.</p>
          <p>Fourthly, it is subverted if what is more the <lb/>
            property (of the thing), is not its property, since <lb/>
            neither will what is less its property be the pro­ <lb/>
            perty, e. g. since the sensible is more the property of animal <lb/>
            than the partible, but the sensible is not the property of <lb/>
            animal, the partible would not be the property of animal. <lb/>
            But it is confirmed if what is less its property is the property <lb/>
            of it, since what is more its property will be the property; <lb/>
            thus, since it is less the property of animal to perceive than to <lb/>
            live, but to perceive is the property of animal, to live would <lb/>
            be the property of animal.</p>
          <p>2. We also as­ <lb/>
            certain whe­ <lb/>
            ther property is <lb/>
            I rightly assign­ <lb/>
            ed, from things <lb/>
            of similar sub­ <lb/>
            sistence. <lb/>

            subversion.</p>
          <p>✹ Vide Ethics <lb/>
            1. 13, and iii. 12.</p>
          <p>Next, from things which exist similarly, first <lb/>
            indeed subverting, if what is similarly the pro­ <lb/>
            perty, is not the property of that of which it is <lb/>
            similarly the property, since neither will what is <lb/>
            similarly property be the property of this of which <lb/>
            it is similarly the property. Thus, since it is <lb/>
            similarly the property of the appetitive part of <lb/>
            the soul to desire, and of the reasoning part to <lb/>
            reason ; * but to desire is not the property of the <lb/>
            appetitive part, neither would to reason be the <lb/>
            property of the reasoning part. On the other hand, we coil­ <pb n="467"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. VIII.]"/>firm it, if what is similarly property is the property of this of <lb/>
            which it is similarly the property; for what is similarly pro­ <lb/>
            perty will be the property of this thing of which it is simi <lb/>
            larly the property. For instance, since what is primarily <lb/>
            prudent is similarly the property of the reasoning part, and <lb/>
            what is primarily temperate of the appetitive part, but what <lb/>
            is primarily prudent is the property of the reasoning, the pri­ <lb/>
            marily temperate would be the property of the appetitive part.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we subvert it, if what is similarly <lb/>
            the property (of a thing) is not its property, since <lb/>
            2nd. <lb/>
            neither will what is similarly property be the property of it. <lb/>
            Thus, since it is similarly the property of man to see and to <lb/>
            hear, but to see is not the property of man,1 neither would the <lb/>
            property of man be to hear. Again, we confirm it, if what is <lb/>
            similarly the property (of a thing) is its property, for what is <lb/>
            similarly its property will be the property; thus, since it is <lb/>
            similarly the property of the soul that a part of it should be <lb/>
            appetitive primarily and argumentative, but it is the property <lb/>
            of the soul that a part of it is primarily appetitive, it would <lb/>
            be the property of the soul that a part of it is primarily <lb/>
            argumentative.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, it is subverted, if it is not the pro­ <lb/>
            pertv of what it is similarly the property, since <lb/>
            3rd. <lb/>
            neither will it be the property of what it is similarly the pro­ <lb/>
            perty, but if it is the property of that, it will not be the <lb/>
            property of the other. Thus, since to burn is similarly the <lb/>
            property of flame and of a burning coal, but it is not the pro­ <lb/>
            perty of flame to burn, neither would it be the property of a <lb/>
            burning coal to burn,2 but if it is the property of flame, it <lb/>
            would not be the property of a burning coal: this place <lb/>
            however is of no use to him who confirms.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, (the place) from things similarly <lb/>
            affected, differs from that from things similarly in­ <lb/>
            herent, because the one is assumed according to <lb/>
            4th. A distinc­ <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>1. Property <lb/>
            subverted if as­ <lb/>
            signed in ca­ <lb/>
            pacity to what <lb/>
            is not.</p>
          <p>NEXT, property is subverted indeed, if he who as­ <lb/>
            signs it in capacity, assigns also that property in <lb/>
            capacity, to that which is not; capacity being by <lb/>
            no possibility present with a non-entity, for what <lb/>
            is laid down to be, will not be, property. Thus, since he who <lb/>
            says the property of air is that which may be breathed, assigns <lb/>
            property in capacity, (for a property of this kind is that which <lb/>
            is capable of being breathed,) but also assigns the property to <lb/>
            that which is not; for although an animal should not exist, <lb/>
            which is naturally capable of breathing the air, yet the air <lb/>
            may exist, though if animal is not, it is not possible to breathe ; <lb/>
            hence a thing of such a kind as that it may be breathed, will <lb/>
            not then be the property of air, when there will not be such <lb/>
            an animal as can breathe, wherefore what may be breathed <lb/>
            would not be the property of air.</p>
          <p>2. Confirmed, <lb/>
            vice versâ.</p>
          <p>Again, we confirm it, if he who assigns it in <lb/>
            capacity either assigns the property to that which <lb/>
            is, or to that which is not, when capacity may be <lb/>
            present with what is not, since what is stated not to be pro­ <lb/>
            perty, will be property. Thus, since he who assigns as the <lb/>
            property of being, the ability to suffer or to act, assigning <lb/>
            property in capacity, has assigned property to being, (for when <lb/>
            being is, it will also be able to suffer, or to do, something,) hence <lb/>
            ability to suffer or to act, would be the property of being.</p>
          <p>3. Subverted if <lb/>
            laid down in <lb/>
            hyperbole.</p>
          <p>Next, it is subverted, if it is placed in hyper­ <lb/>
            bole, since what is laid down to be, will not be <lb/>
            property. For it happens to those who thus as­ <lb/>
            sign property, that the name is not verified in respect of what <lb/>
            the sentence1 is verified, since the thing being corrupted, the <lb/>
            sentence will nevertheless remain, for it will especially be pre­ <lb/>
            sent with something existing; thus, if some one should as­ <lb/>
            sign the property of fire to be the lightest body, for when fire <lb/>
            is corrupted, there will be a certain body, which will be the <lb/>
            0 <unclear>As</unclear> a, , <lb/>
            lightest,* so that the lightest body would not be <lb/>
            the property of fire. It is confirmed however, if <note type="footnote"> I i. e. the property. </note> <pb n="469"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP.I.]"/>the property is not placed in hyperbole, for as to this, the pro­ <lb/>
            perty will be well stated, e. g. since he who states the pro­ <lb/>
            perty of man, to be an animal naturally mild, does not assign <lb/>
            property in hyperbole, so far as regards this, the property <lb/>
            would be well stated.</p>

          <p>THERE are five parts of the discussion of defini­ <lb/>
            tion, for (the latter is reprehended), because it is <lb/>
            not altogether true to assert that the sentence- <lb/>
            (is predicated) of what the name t is; (since it is <lb/>

            the differences, since of things in the definition, genus espe­ <lb/>

            or because the sentence is not proper; since it is necessary <lb/>

          <p>Whether, then, the sentence also is not verified <lb/>

          <p>3. The remain­ <lb/>
            ing inquiry is, <lb/>
            about proper <lb/>
            definition, or <lb/>
            its subsistence <lb/>
            at all.</p>
          <p>It remains, then, to declare how we must in­ <lb/>
            stitute an inquiry, whether a thing is not defined, <lb/>
            or whether it is not rightly defined ; first, indeed, <lb/>
            then we must see whether it is not rightly defined, <lb/>
            since it is easier to do any thing (merely), than to <lb/>
            do it well. Now it is clear that an error is more frequent <lb/>

            and the other, whether he has stated the definition more ex­ <lb/>
            tensively than is requisite, as every thing added in the de­ <lb/>
            finition is superfluous. Again, each of the above-named is <lb/>
            divided into many parts.</p>

          <p>1. Definition <lb/>
            faulty from <lb/>

            words) leading and harmony are equivocal, there­ <lb/>
            fore it is doubtful which of the things signified, <lb/>
            by what is multifariously predicated, a person <lb/>
            wishes to assert. In like manner also, if when the thing de­ <lb/>
            fined is multifariously predicated, a person expresses himself <lb/>
            without distinction, as it will be dubious of what he has given <lb/>
            the definition, and it is possible to cavil, as if the definition <lb/>
            were not adapted to every thing of which he has given the <lb/>
            definition.1 Now, such a thing it is especially possible to <lb/>
            do, when there is latent equivocation, and also it is possible, <lb/>
            when a person has distinguished in how many ways what is <lb/>
            assigned in the definition is predicated, to form a syllogism: <lb/>
            for if it is not sufficiently stated in any mode, it is clear that it <lb/>
            has not been defined according to that mode. <note type="footnote"> I Cf. Waitz. </note></p><pb n="471"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. II.]"/>
          <p>Another (place is), if it is spoken metaphori­ <lb/>
            cally, for instance, that science is that which can­ <lb/>
            not fall, or that the earth is a nurse,1 or that <lb/>
            temperance is symphony, as every thing enunci- <lb/>
            2. Obscurity <lb/>
            incident to <lb/>
            metaphor. <lb/>
            Vide Aldrich, <lb/>
            ch. i. 8. <lb/>
            ated metaphorically is obscure. It is also possible for him <lb/>
            who uses a metaphor to cavil that he has spoken- <lb/>
            rightly, for the given definition will not suit, e. g. <lb/>
            in the case of temperance, since all symphony is <lb/>
            in sounds. Besides, if symphony be the genus of <lb/>
            * So Waitz <lb/>
            and Bekker, <lb/>
            but Buhle and <lb/>
            Taylor insert <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὺ</foreign>. <lb/>
            temperance, the same thing will be in two genera not con­ <lb/>
            taining each other, since neither does symphony contain virtue, <lb/>
            nor virtue symphony.</p>
          <p>Moreover, (the definition is obscure,) if estab­ <lb/>
            lished names are not used, as Plato calls the eye, <lb/>
            that which is shaded by the eyebrows, or a spider, <lb/>
            3. Also to un­ <lb/>
            usual terms. <lb/>
            a feeder on putrescence, or the marrow, bone-begetter, since <lb/>
            whatever is unusual, is obscure.2</p>
          <p>Some things, however, are asserted neither <lb/>
            equivocally, nor metaphorically, nor properly, for <lb/>
            instance, law (defined as) a measure, or an image <lb/>
            of things naturally just. Such things, indeed, are <lb/>
            4. Also if an <lb/>
            expression be <lb/>
            used, not in its <lb/>
            proper sense. <lb/>
            worse than metaphor, for metaphor in some way makes known <lb/>
            what is signified on account of similitude,3 as all who use <lb/>
            metaphors do so according to a certain similitude, but this <lb/>
            kind of thing does not make known, as neither is there any <lb/>
            similitude, according to which law is a measure or an image, <lb/>
            nor is it accustomed to be predicated properly. Wherefore, if <lb/>
            a person says that law is properly a measure or an image, he <lb/>
            speaks falsely, for an image is that, the generation of which <lb/>
            is by imitation, but this does not exist in law: but if it is <lb/>
            improperly, it is clear that he speaks obscurely, and worse <lb/>
            than any thing spoken metaphorically. <note type="footnote"> 1 Vide Iliad Z. Eustathius observes, the earth is so called from being <lb/>

          <p>1. Observation <lb/>
            upon excess to <lb/>
            be made, if any <lb/>
            thing be intro­ <lb/>
            duced which is <lb/>
            predicated of <lb/>
            all things, or <lb/>
            of those which <lb/>
            are in the same <lb/>
            genus as the <lb/>
            thing to be de­ <lb/>
            fined.</p>
          <p>IF then definition be obscure, we must examine <lb/>
            from such places as these, but if it has been stated <lb/>
            excessively,3 we must first see whether any thing <lb/>
            is employed which is present with all things, or sim­ <lb/>
            ply with beings, or with those which are under the <lb/>
            same genus with the thing defined ; since it must <lb/>
            inevitably happen that this will be asserted in ex­ <lb/>
            cess. For it is requisite to separate genus from <lb/>
            other things, but difference from something of those in the <lb/>
            same genus, wherefore what is present with all things is sim­ <lb/>
            ply separated from nothing, but what is present with all under <lb/>
            the same genus is not separated from those in the same genus, <lb/>
            so that an addition of this kind is vain.</p>
          <p>2. Whether any <lb/>
            part of the de­ <lb/>
            finition being <lb/>
            abstracted, the <lb/>
            remainder de­ <lb/>
            fines the thing.</p>
          <p>Or (we must observe), whether what is added <lb/>
            be proper, but this being taken away the remain­ <lb/>
            ing definition is proper, and demonstrates sub­ <lb/>
            stance, e. g. in the definition of man, receptive of <lb/>
            science is superfluously added, since this being <lb/>
            taken away, the remaining definition is appropriate, and mani­ <lb/>
            fests the substance. In a word, every thing is superfluous, <lb/>
            which when taken away the remainder causes the thing de­ <lb/>
            fined to be manifest, such indeed is the definition of the soul, <lb/>
            if it be number moving itself, for that which itself moves <lb/>
            * Cf. Arist. de <lb/>

            itself is soul, as Plato has defined it.- Or is <lb/>
            what has been mentioned property indeed, yet <lb/>
            does not manifest essence. when number is taken <note type="footnote"> I As from the definition of whiteness, that of blackness is evident; for <lb/>

            essence of the soul ? </note> <pb n="473"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. III.]"/>away ? In what way then the thing is, is hard to explain,1 <lb/>
            but we must use (this place) in all such things as may be <lb/>
            expedient. For instance, that the definition of phlegm is, the <lb/>
            first unconcocted moisture from food, for there is one first, <lb/>
            not many, so that the addition of unconcocted is superfluous, <lb/>
            since when this is taken away, what remains will be the pro­ <lb/>
            per definition, since it is impossible that this and something <lb/>
            else, should be the first (moisture) arising from food. Or shall <lb/>
            we say that phlegm is not simply the first thing from food, <lb/>
            but the first of things unconcocted, so that unconcocted must <lb/>
            be added, for if it is stated in that way the definition will not <lb/>
            be true, since it is not the first of all things.</p>
          <p>Moreover, (we must examine) whether some <lb/>
            one of the things in the definition, is not present <lb/>
            with all those under the same species, since such is <lb/>
            defined worse than they do, who use that which is <lb/>
            present with all substances. For in that way the <lb/>
            remainder would be the proper definition, and the <lb/>
            3. Whether <lb/>
            there is any <lb/>
            thing in the de. <lb/>
            finition, which <lb/>
            cannot be pre­ <lb/>
            dicated of all <lb/>
            subjects, of the <lb/>
            same species. <lb/>
            whole would be proper; since, in short, if any thing true is <lb/>
            added to property, the whole (definition) becomes proper. It <lb/>
            however something of those in the definition is not present <lb/>
            with all those under the same species, it is impossible that the <lb/>
            whole definition should be proper, since it will not be reci­ <lb/>
            procally predicated of the thing, e. g. an animal pedestrian <lb/>
            biped of four cubits, for such a definition is not reciprocally <lb/>
            predicated of the thing, from four cubits not being present <lb/>
            with all those, which are under the same species.</p>
          <p>Again, whether the same thing is frequently <lb/>
            stated, as he who says, that desire is the appetite <lb/>
            of the pleasant, for all desire is of the pleasant; <lb/>
            4. If the same <lb/>
            thing be stated <lb/>
            frequently. <lb/>
            wherefore what is the same with desire will also be of the plea­ <lb/>
            sant, the definition then of desire is the appetite of <lb/>
            the pleasant,2* for there is no difference between <lb/>
            saying desire or the appetite of the pleasant, so <lb/>

            the same with man will also be biped, but an animal pedes­ <lb/>
            trian biped is the same as man, so that anima! pedestrian <lb/>
            biped is biped. Nevertheless, no absurdity happens on this <lb/>
            account, for biped is not predicated of pedestrian animal, (for <lb/>
            thus indeed biped would be twice predicated of the same <lb/>
            thing,) but biped is predicated about animal pedestrian biped, <lb/>
            wherefore biped is predicated once only. In the same man­ <lb/>

            so that here also the predication is once. Still, <lb/>

            does not belong to absurdity, but frequently to predicate the <lb/>
            same about a certain thing, as when Xenocrates says that <lb/>

            privation of heat, since privation itself makes it known that it <lb/>
            is spoken of what is naturally.</p>
          <p>5. If the same <lb/>
            thing stated <lb/>
            universally, is <lb/>
            stated also in <lb/>
            addition, of a <lb/>

          <p>Again, whether what is universally asserted <lb/>

            for the just is something profitable, wherefore it <lb/>

            truth, or falsity, <lb/>
            of definition.</p>
          <p>First, if he has not made the definition through <lb/>
            things prior and more known. For since defini­ <lb/>
            tion is assigned for the sake of knowing what is <lb/>
            said, but we know not from things casual, but <lb/>
            from what are prior and more known, as in de­ <lb/>
            monstrations, (for thus all doctrine and discipline <lb/>
            subsists,) it is clear that he who does not define <lb/>
            1. False, if the <lb/>
            definition be <lb/>
            not through <lb/>

            Aid rich, Rule <lb/>
            2.) <lb/>
            through such things as these, does not define (rightly). But <lb/>
            if not, there will be many definitions of the same thing, since <lb/>
            it is evident that whoever defines through things prior and <lb/>
            more known, defines in a better manner, so that both defini­ <lb/>
            lions would be of the same thing; this however does not seem <lb/>
            so, as to each being, to be what it is, is one thing, so that if <lb/>
            there should be many definitions of the same thing, there will <lb/>
            be the same essence of the thing defined, as is manifested <lb/>
            by each of the definitions. These (essences) however are <lb/>
            not the same, since the definitions are different, wherefore he <lb/>

          <p>To assume then that a definition is not framed <lb/>

            a line than a superficies, and a superficies than a solid, as also <lb/>
            unity than number, for it is prior to, and the principle of, all <lb/>
            number; likewise a letter than a syllable. Nevertheless, to us, <lb/>
            the reverse sometimes happens, since a solid falls under sense <lb/>
            rather than a superficies, but a superficies more than a line, <lb/>
            and a line more than a point, for the multitude know these <lb/>
            things in a greater degree, since some things it is possible <lb/>
            for any casual intellect to discern, but others belong to an in­ <lb/>
            tellect accurate and transcendent.</p>
          <p>3. A true defi­ <lb/>
            nition is from <lb/>
            things which <lb/>
            are simply, and <lb/>
            of themselves, <lb/>
            more known.</p>
          <p>Simply then, it is better to aim at the know­ <lb/>
            ledge of things posterior through such as are <lb/>
            prior, for a thing of this kind is more scientific; <lb/>
            still by those who are incapable of knowing <lb/>
            through things of this kind. it is perhaps neces­ <lb/>
            sary to frame the definition through things known to them. <lb/>
            Now of such definitions, are those of a point, and of a line, <lb/>
            and of a superficies, for all manifest things prior, through such <lb/>
            as are posterior, for they say that one is the boundary of a <lb/>
            line, the other of a superficies, and the other of a solid. Still <lb/>
            we must not be unmindful that those who define thus, cannot <lb/>
            denote what the nature is of the thing defined, unless the <lb/>
            same thing should happen both to be more known to us, and <lb/>
            simply to be more known, since he who well defines must <lb/>
            necessarily do so, through the genus and the differences, but <lb/>
            these are of the number of things more known simply than, <lb/>
            and prior to, species. For genus and difference co-subvert <lb/>
            species,1 so that these are prior to species. They are also <lb/>
            more known, for if species is known, it is necessary that genus <lb/>
            also and difference should be known, (as he who knows man, <lb/>
            knows both animal and pedestrian,) but when genus or dif­ <lb/>
            ference is known, it is not necessary that species also should <lb/>
            be known, wherefore species is more unknown. Besides, to <lb/>
            those who really call things of this kind, definitions, which <note type="footnote"> notior definito," he means that the former should be composed of parts, <lb/>
            greater in extension, though less in comprehension, than the definition: <lb/>
            as are the genus and differentia, compared with the species. These <lb/>
            universal notions are <foreign xml:lang="grc">γνωριμώτερα φύσει</foreign>, though individuals and lower <lb/>
            species are <foreign xml:lang="grc">γνωριμώτερα ήμιν</foreign>. Vide Mansel's Logic; also Hill's Logic, <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. IV.]"/>consist of what are known to every one, it will happen to say <lb/>
            that there are many definitions of the same thing, since some <lb/>
            things are more known to some persons, and not the same to all, <lb/>
            so that there would be a different definition to be given to each <lb/>
            person, if it were necessary that definition should be framed <lb/>
            from things more known to each severally. Further, to the <lb/>
            same persons at a certain time, certain things are more known, <lb/>
            at first indeed sensibles, but the reverse when they become <lb/>
            more accurate, so that neither would the same definition have <lb/>
            to be given to the same person, by those who say that a de­ <lb/>
            finition must be given through things more known to each. <lb/>
            Clearly, then, we must not define through such things, but <lb/>
            through those that are simply more known, since thus only <lb/>
            would one and the same definition be always produced. Per­ <lb/>
            haps indeed what is simply known is not that which is known <lb/>
            to all, but that (which is known) to those who have their in­ <lb/>
            tellect well disposed, just as what is simply wholesome is that <lb/>
            which is so, to those whose bodies are in a good state. Hence <lb/>
            it is necessary accurately to explain each of these, and to use <lb/>
            them in discussion as may be expedient, but most confessedly <lb/>
            is it possible to subvert definition, if it be neither framed <lb/>
            from things simply more known, nor from those (which are <lb/>
            so) to us.</p>
          <p>One mode then (of proving) that it is not <lb/>
            through things more known, is when the prior is <lb/>
            manifested through the posterior, as we observed <lb/>
            before ; another, if the definition of what is at rest <lb/>
            4. What is con­ <lb/>
            stant,ought not <lb/>
            therefore to be <lb/>
            defined, by the <lb/>
            inconstant. <lb/>
            and definite, is a sign to us through the indefinite and through <lb/>
            what is in motion, since the permanent and definite are prior <lb/>
            to the indefinite, and to what is in motion.</p>
          <p>The modes indeed (of showing a definition to <lb/>
            be) not from things prior, are three, first, if the <lb/>
            opposite is defined through the opposite, as good <lb/>
            5. Nor the con­ <lb/>
            trary, by the <lb/>
            contrary. <lb/>
            through evil, for opposites are naturally simultaneous. Still <lb/>
            to some there seems to be the same science of both, so that the <lb/>
            one is not more known than the other; nevertheless, we must <lb/>
            bear in mind that some things perhaps it is impossible to de­ <lb/>
            fine otherwise, as the double without the half, and whatever <lb/>
            things are enunciated relatively1 per se, for in all these there <lb/>
            is the same essence from their having relation in a certain re <note type="footnote"> 1 See the note of Waltz on this passage. </note> <pb n="478"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK VI."/>spect, so that it is impossible to know the one without the <lb/>
            other, wherefore in the definition of the one; the other must <lb/>
            of necessity be comprehended. All such things, then, it is <lb/>
            necessary to know, and to employ them as may appear useful.</p>
          <p>6. Nor the <lb/>
            thing itself, to <lb/>
            be Included in <lb/>
            its own defini­ <lb/>
            tion.</p>
          <p>Another (place) is, if in the definition the thing <lb/>
            defined is used, but this is latent when a person <lb/>
            does not employ the very name of the thing de­ <lb/>
            fined, as if he should define the sun to be a star <lb/>
            apparent by day, for using day, he uses sun. In order to de­ <lb/>
            tect such, we must take the definition instead of the name, as <lb/>
            the day is the motion of the sun above the earth ; for it is clear <lb/>
            that he who speaks of the motion of the sun above the earth, <lb/>
            mentions the sun, so that he who uses day, uses sun.</p>
          <p>7. Nor ought <lb/>
            the definition <lb/>
            to be by a co- <lb/>
            ordinate.</p>
          <p>Again, if what is in an opposite division is de­ <lb/>
            fined by what is in an opposite one, as the odd <lb/>
            to be what is greater than the even, by unity: <lb/>
            for things oppositely divided from the same ge­ <lb/>
            nus are naturally simultaneous, but the odd and even, are <lb/>
            divided oppositely, since both are differences of number.</p>
          <p>8. Nor by the <lb/>
            subjects of the <lb/>
            thing defined.</p>
          <p>Similarly also if the superior is defined through <lb/>
            the inferior, as that the even number is what may <lb/>
            be divided into two parts, or that good is the <lb/>
            habit of virtue; for the expression, "into two parts," is assumed <lb/>
            from two, which is an even number; virtue also is a certain <lb/>
            good, so that these are under those. Besides, it is necessary <lb/>
            that whoever uses the inferior should use also (the thing de­ <lb/>
            fined) itself; for both he who uses virtue uses good, since vir­ <lb/>
            tue is a certain good, and likewise also he who uses " in two <lb/>
            parts" uses the even, because a division into two parts, sig­ <lb/>
            nifies to be divided into two, but two is an even number.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>UNIVERSALLY then, one place is, that a definition is no­ <lb/>
            framed through things prior and more known, but the par <lb/>
            1. We must <lb/>
            observe whe. <lb/>
            ther genus, of <lb/>
            the thing to be <lb/>
            defined,is omit­ <lb/>
            ted. <lb/>
            ticulars of it are such as have been mentioned <lb/>
            The second place is, if when a thing is in genus <lb/>
            it is not placed in genus, but in all such, an error <lb/>
            occurs in the definition of which, what a thing is, <lb/>
            is not previously declared;1 for instance, the de- <note type="footnote"> I That is, where the definition does not commence with that, which ex. <lb/>
            presses the nature, of the thing to be defined. </note> <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. V.]"/>dilution of body as having three dimensions, or if any one <lb/>
            should define man to be that which is cognizant of number. <lb/>
            For it has not been stated what that is which has three di­ <lb/>
            mensions, or what it is which is cognizant of number; but <lb/>
            genus would signify what a thing is, and is the first thing <lb/>
            supposed, of those predicated in the definition.</p>
          <p>Besides, if when the thing defined belongs to <lb/>
            many things, it is not adapted to all, as if some <lb/>
            one should define grammar to be the science of <lb/>
            writing what is dictated; for (the words) and of <lb/>
            reading also, are wanting, since he has no more de- <lb/>
            2. Whether any <lb/>
            thing be left <lb/>
            out, of those to <lb/>
            which the defi­ <lb/>
            niendum be­ <lb/>
            longs. <lb/>
            fined grammar, who defines it to be the art of writing, than he <lb/>
            who states it to be the art of reading, so that neither defines, <lb/>
            but he who states both of these, since there cannot be many <lb/>
            definitions of the same thing. In some instances then, the <lb/>
            case is really as we have stated, but in others it is not, as in <lb/>
            those which do not essentially belong to both; thus, medicine <lb/>
            (is the science) of producing disease and health, for of the one <lb/>
            it is said (to be the science essentially, but of the other acci­ <lb/>
            dentally, as to produce disease is simply foreign <lb/>
            from medicine. Wherefore he does not more de­ <lb/>
            fine, who refers to both,. than he does who refers <lb/>
            to one, † of these, but perhaps even in a worse <lb/>
            manner, since any other person ‡ is able to pro­ <lb/>
            duce disease.</p>
          <p>* To producing <lb/>
            both health <lb/>
            and disease. <lb/>
            t The produc­ <lb/>
            tion of health <lb/>
            alone. <lb/>
            ‡ Than a phy­ <lb/>
            sician.</p>
          <p>Besides, (he errs,) who does not refer to the <lb/>
            better, but to the worse, when there are many <lb/>
            things, to which that defined, belongs, since every <lb/>
            science and faculty seems to belong to what is <lb/>
            best.</p>
          <p>3. Whether the <lb/>
            thing be re­ <lb/>
            ferred, not to <lb/>
            the better, but <lb/>
            to the worse.</p>
          <p>Again, whether what is asserted is not placed <lb/>
            in its proper genus, must be observed from the <lb/>
            elements belonging to genera, as we stated before.</p>
          <p>4. Whether the <lb/>
            genus be not <lb/>
            rightly consti­ <lb/>
            tuted.</p>
          <p>Moreover, if stepping over, he speaks of ge­ <lb/>
            nera,1 as he who (defines) justice to be a habit <lb/>
            productive of equality, or distributive of the equal, <lb/>
            for when he thus defines, he passes over virtue. <lb/>
            5. Whether the <lb/>
            proximum ge­ <lb/>
            nus be not as­ <lb/>
            sumed. <lb/>
            Omitting then the genus of justice, he does not state what its <lb/>
            nature is, for the essence of every thing is connected with <note type="footnote"> 1 Who, omitting the proximate genus, proposes some remote and supe­ <lb/>
            nor genus. </note> <pb n="480"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK VI."/>the genus. This however is the same thing with not placing <lb/>
            it in the nearest genus, for he who places it in the nearest, <lb/>
            has mentioned all the superior, since all the superior genera <lb/>
            are predicated of the inferior. Hence, it must either be <lb/>
            placed in the nearest genus, or he must add all the differences, <lb/>
            through which the nearest genus is defined, to the superior <lb/>
            genus; for thus he will have omitted nothing, but instead of a <lb/>
            name, will have mentioned the inferior genus, in the definition. <lb/>
            Whoever, on the other hand, speaks of the superior genus <lb/>
            alone, does not mention also the inferior genus, for the one <lb/>
            who calls a thing a plant, does not state it to be a tree.</p>

            ference to be <lb/>
            considered.</p>
          <p>AGAIN, we must in like manner consider with <lb/>
            regard to differences, whether those of genus are <lb/>
            introduced, for unless a person defines by the pro­ <lb/>
            per differences of a thing, or altogether asserts what can be <lb/>
            the differences of nothing, as animal or substance, he evidently <lb/>
            does not define, since the things stated are not the differences <lb/>
            of any thing. Observe also, whether any thing is divided <lb/>
            oppositely to the difference stated, for if there is not, what is <lb/>
            stated will evidently not be the difference of genus, since <lb/>
            every genus is divided by differences oppositely divided, as <lb/>
            animal by the pedestrian and winged, by the aquatic and <lb/>
            * Cf. Cat. 10 ; <lb/>
            Aldrich (Man­ <lb/>

            biped.*1 Or if indeed there is an oppositely di­ <lb/>
            vided difference, which however is not verified of <lb/>
            the genus, since evidently neither would be the <lb/>
            difference of genus, as all oppositely divided dif­ <lb/>
            ferences are verified of their proper genus. Likewise, if it is <lb/>
            indeed verified, but (the difference) when added to genus does <lb/>
            not produce species, since it is evident that this would not be <lb/>
            the specific difference of genus, as every specific difference <lb/>
            united with genus produces species; but if this be not the <note type="footnote"> I Dichotomy, or a division of every genus into two species by opposed <lb/>
            differentiæ, is only here practicable when the contraries admit no medium <lb/>
            between them : examples of it are found in the Arbor Porphyriana; see <lb/>
            also Eth. Nic. vii. 6. Plato's favourite method of dichotomy was by <lb/>
            contradiction, and he was followed in it by Ramus and his successors. <lb/>

            divided oppositely to this.</p>
          <p>Moreover (he errs), if he divides genus by ne­ <lb/>
            gation, as those who define a line to be length <lb/>
            without breadth, since this signifies nothing else <lb/>
            than that it has no breadth;1 the genus then will <lb/>
            2. Also whe­ <lb/>
            ther genus, be <lb/>
            divided by ne­ <lb/>
            gation. <lb/>
            happen to partake of the species, for every length is either <lb/>
            with, or without breadth, since of every thing either anima­ <lb/>
            tion or negation is verified, so that the genus of a line which <lb/>
            is length, will either be without breadth, or will have breadth. <lb/>
            But length without breadth is the definition of the species; <lb/>
            likewise, length with breadth, for without breadth and with <lb/>
            breadth are differences; but the definition of species is from <lb/>
            the difference and the genus; so that genus would receive <lb/>
            the definition of species; in like manner also, the definition <lb/>
            of difference, since one of the above-named differences is ne­ <lb/>
            cessarily predicated of genus. The place mentioned however <lb/>
            is useful against those who assert that there are ideas, for if <lb/>
            there is length itself, how will it be predicated of the genus <lb/>
            that it has breadth or has it not,2 for it is necessary that one <lb/>
            of these should be verified of every length, if it is to be veri­ <lb/>
            fied of the genus. This however does not occur, since there <lb/>
            are lengths without breadth, and those which have breadth, <lb/>
            so that this place is useful against those only, who say that <lb/>
            genus is one in number, and this they do who <lb/>
            admit ideas, for they say that length itself and <lb/>
            animal itself are genera.­</p>
          <p>* Vide Metaph. <lb/>
            lib. ii., Leipsic <lb/>
            ed.</p>
          <p>Perhaps, indeed, in some cases it is necessary <lb/>
            for a person when defining, to use negation, as in <lb/>
            privations, for that thing is blind which has not <lb/>
            2. Exceptional <lb/>
            case. <lb/>
            sight, when it is naturally adapted to have it. Still it makes <lb/>
            no difference whether we divide genus by negation, or by such <lb/>
            an affirmation, as to which it is necessary that negation should <lb/>
            be oppositely divided; for instance, if length were defined to <lb/>
            be that which has breadth, for to what has breadth that which <note type="footnote"> 1 Several of the mathematical definitions fail, when tested by logical <lb/>
            accuracy. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Length, as in idea, is without dimension, consequently has no length, <lb/>
            but is the cause of all length. Hence, neither the possession nor the <lb/>
            privation of breadth can be predicated of it: the latter however is alone <lb/>
            predicated properly of the geometrical line, and the former of what is <lb/>
            material and sensible. Cf. Boethius de Divisione; Metap. vi. 4. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 I </note> <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK VI."/><lb/>
            has not breadth, is oppositely divided, but nothing else, so that <lb/>
            the genus is again divided by negation.</p>
          <p>3. Whether <lb/>
            species be <lb/>
            assigned as <lb/>
            difference.</p>
          <p>Again observe, whether species is assigned as <lb/>
            difference, as they do who define contumely to be <lb/>
            insolence with derision, for derision is a certain <lb/>
            insolence, so that derision is not difference, but <lb/>
            species.</p>
          <p>of. Or genus be <lb/>
            so assigned.</p>
          <p>Moreover, whether genus is assigned as differ­ <lb/>
            ence, as that virtue is a good or worthy habit, for <lb/>
            good is the genus of virtue; or is good not a genus, <lb/>
            but a difference, since it is true that the same thing cannot <lb/>
            possibly be in two genera which do not comprehend each <lb/>
            other? For neither does good contain habit, nor habit good, <lb/>
            since not every habit is good, nor every thing good, a habit; <lb/>
            hence they would not both be genera. If, then, habit be the <lb/>
            genus of virtue, it is evident that good is not the genus, but <lb/>
            rather the difference; besides, habit signifies what the virtue <lb/>
            is, but good does not signify what, but what kind of thing it <lb/>
            is ; indeed difference, seems to signify quality.</p>
          <p>5. Whether the <lb/>
            difference sig­ <lb/>
            nify this parti­ <lb/>
            cular thing.</p>
          <p>Observe, also, whether the assigned difference <lb/>
            does not signify quality, but this particular thing ; <lb/>
            since every difference appears to signify a certain <lb/>
            quality.</p>
          <p>6. Or has the <lb/>
            notion of <lb/>
            accident.</p>
          <p>Consider, also, whether difference is accident­ <lb/>
            ally present with the thing defined, for no differ­ <lb/>
            ence is of the number of things accidentally pre­ <lb/>
            sent, as neither is genus, since it is not possible that difference <lb/>
            should be present with a certain thing, and not be present.</p>
          <p>7. Or if differ­ <lb/>
            ence or species <lb/>
            be predicated <lb/>
            of genus.</p>
          <p>Moreover, if difference or species be predicated <lb/>
            of genus, or something which is the subject of <lb/>
            species, there will not be a definition, for nothing <lb/>
            of what we have mentioned can possibly be pre­ <lb/>
            dicated of genus, since genus is the most extensively spoken <lb/>
            8. Or genus of <lb/>
            the difference. <lb/>
            of all. Again, it the genus is predicated of the <lb/>
            difference, for genus seems to be predicated not of <lb/>
            difference, but of those of which difference (is <lb/>
            predicated) ; thus, animal of man, and ox, and other pedestrian <lb/>
            animals, and not of difference itself, which is spoken of species. <lb/>
            For if animal were predicated of each of the differences, many <lb/>
            animals would be predicated of the species, for differences are <lb/>
            predicated of species. Again, all differences will either be <pb n="483"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. VI.]"/>species or individuals if they are animals, since each animal <lb/>
            is either species or individual.1</p>
          <p>Likewise, we must observe, whether species or <lb/>
            some one of those under species, is predicated of <lb/>
            difference, for this is impossible, since difference is <lb/>
            9. Or species <lb/>
            of difference. <lb/>
            more widely predicated than species ; further, difference will <lb/>
            happen to be species, if a certain species is predicated of it, <lb/>
            for if man is predicated (of difference), man is evidently a <lb/>
            difference. Again, (see) whether difference be not prior to <lb/>
            species, since difference must necessarily be posterior to genus, <lb/>
            but prior to species.</p>
          <p>Observe, too, whether the assigned difference is <lb/>
            of another genus, neither contained by, nor con­ <lb/>
            taining it, as the same difference does not appear <lb/>
            to be of two genera not comprehending each other. <lb/>
            10. Whether <lb/>
            the same differ­ <lb/>
            ence belong to <lb/>
            another genus <lb/>
            Otherwise, the same species would happen to be in two genera <lb/>
            not comprehending each other, since each difference introduces <lb/>
            its own appropriate genus, as pedestrian and biped co-intro­ <lb/>
            duce animal; wherefore, if each of the genera be predicated of <lb/>
            what the difference is, it is evident that the species is in two <lb/>
            genera not comprehending each other. Or is it not impossible <lb/>
            that there should be the same difference of two genera not <lb/>
            comprehending each other, but it must be added, neither are <lb/>
            both under the same? For pedestrian animal, and winged <lb/>
            animal, are genera not comprehending each other, and biped <lb/>
            is a difference of both these, wherefore, it must be added, that <lb/>
            neither are both under the same, for both of these are under <lb/>
            animal. It is evident, also, that difference need not always <lb/>
            introduce its appropriate genus, since there may be possibly <lb/>
            the same (difference) of two genera not comprehending each <lb/>
            other, but it is necessary that it should co-introduce one alone, <lb/>
            and those which are above it, as biped, winged, pedestrian, <lb/>
            co-introduce animal.</p>
          <p>Observe, also, whether to be in a certain thing <lb/>
            is assigned as the difference of substance, for sub­ <lb/>
            stance does not seem to differ from substance in <lb/>
            being some where, wherefore also, those are to be <lb/>
            11. Whether <lb/>
            situation be <lb/>
            assigned as the <lb/>
            difference of <lb/>
            substance. <lb/>
            blamed, who divide animal by pedestrian and aquatic, as it pe­ <lb/>
            destrian and aquatic signified being some where. Or are they <note type="footnote"> 1 This argument is brought to show that genus is not predicated of <lb/>
            difference. See Waitz, also Mansel's Appendix B. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 1 2 </note> <pb n="484"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK VI."/>not rightly blamed in these things ? for the aquatic does not <lb/>
            signify the being in something or some where, but a certain <lb/>
            quality, since it would be similarly aquatic, if it should even <lb/>
            be in a dry place; likewise, also, the terrestrial, even in a <lb/>
            moist place, will be terrestrial and not aquatic; at the same <lb/>
            time, if ever difference signifies the being in a certain thing, <lb/>
            it is evident that (he who defines will err.</p>
          <p>12. Or affection <lb/>
            be assigned as <lb/>
            difference.</p>
          <p>Again, (notice) whether passion is assigned as <lb/>
            difference; for every passion, when increased, alters <lb/>
            the essence, but difference is not a thing of this <lb/>
            kind, but difference appears rather to preserve that of which <lb/>
            it is the difference, and it is simply impossible for any thing <lb/>
            * i. e. remain. <lb/>
            to be. without its proper difference, since pees­ <lb/>
            trian not existing, there will not be man. In a <lb/>
            word, nothing of those, according to which the thing possess­ <lb/>
            ing it, is changed in quality, is the difference of it, for all such, <lb/>
            when increased, alter the essence, so that if any one assigns <lb/>
            a certain difference of this kind, he errs, as, in short, we are <lb/>
            not changed in quality, according to differences.</p>
          <p>13. Whether <lb/>
            the difference <lb/>
            of relatives, be <lb/>
            not relative.</p>
          <p>He also (mistakes), who assigns the difference <lb/>
            of a certain relative, not with reference to some­ <lb/>
            thing else ; for of relatives, the difference is also <lb/>
            a relative, as in the case of science, for it is said <lb/>
            to be contemplative, practical, and effective; but each of these <lb/>
            signifies relation, since it is contemplative of something, and <lb/>
            effective, and practical of something.</p>
          <p>14. Whether <lb/>
            the relation be <lb/>
            apt.</p>
          <p>Examine, also, whether he who defines, assigns <lb/>
            that to which each relative is naturally adapted, <lb/>
            for some things can only be employed for that to <lb/>
            which each relative is naturally adapted, but for nothing else, <lb/>
            some, on the other hand, for something else also; thus, the <lb/>
            sight is (employed) for seeing only, but some one may draw <lb/>
            up a weight, even with a strigil; notwithstanding, whoever <lb/>
            should define a strigil an instrument for drawing1 would err, <lb/>
            for it is not naturally adapted to this ; the definition however <lb/>
            of what a thing is naturally adapted to, is that for which a <lb/>
            prudent man, so far as he is prudent, would use it, also the <lb/>
            science which properly belongs to each. <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Στλεγγὶς</foreign>. In Aristoph. Thesmop. (556) it is used of an instrument <lb/>
            by which wine is drawn off from a cask: it is a curry-comb, properly, <lb/>
            but has various significations. </note> <pb n="485"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. VI.]"/></p>
          <p>Further, (examine) whether or not, the (defini­ <lb/>
            tion) is assigned of what is first, when it happens <lb/>
            to belong to many things, e. g. that prudence is <lb/>
            the virtue of man, or of the soul, and not of the <lb/>
            Whether <lb/>
            15. definition <lb/>
            be <lb/>
            the of what is <lb/>
            proximate. <lb/>
            reasoning part, for prudence is the virtue of the reasoning part <lb/>
            primarily, since according to this, both the soul and man are <lb/>
            said to be prudent.</p>
          <p>Again, he errs, unless that is receptive of which <lb/>
            the thing defined is stated to be the passion, or <lb/>
            disposition, or something else ; for every disposi­ <lb/>
            tion and every passion is naturally generated in <lb/>
            that of which it is the disposition or passion, as <lb/>
            16. Whether <lb/>
            the affection be <lb/>
            truly in that, <lb/>
            of which it is <lb/>
            defined the af­ <lb/>
            fection. <lb/>
            science in the soul, being a disposition of the soul. Sometimes <lb/>
            indeed men mistake in these things, as they do who say that <lb/>
            sleep is the impotency of sense, and that doubt is the equality <lb/>
            of contrary arguments, and that pain is a separation accom­ <lb/>
            panied with violence, of connascent parts; for neither is sleep <lb/>
            present with sense, which it ought to be if it is the impo­ <lb/>
            tency of sense, likewise neither is doubt present with contrary <lb/>
            arguments, nor pain with connascent parts, for things inani­ <lb/>
            mate would suffer pain, since pain would be present with <lb/>
            them. Such also is the definition of health if it is the har­ <lb/>
            mony of hot and cold, for it is necessary that things hot and <lb/>
            cold should be in health, since the harmony of each, is in those <lb/>
            of which it is the harmony, so that health would be in them ; <lb/>
            besides, by those who thus define, it happens that the thing <lb/>
            made is reduced to the maker, or contrariwise, for neither is <lb/>
            the separation of connascent parts, pain, but is productive of <lb/>
            pain, nor is the impotency of sense, sleep, but one is effective <lb/>
            of the other, for either we sleep in consequence of becoming <lb/>
            powerless, or we become powerless in consequence of sleep. <lb/>
            Likewise, also, the equality of contrary arguments would appear <lb/>
            productive of doubt, for when in reasoning on both sides of <lb/>
            a question, every thing appears to us to have equal weight on <lb/>
            either side, then we doubt which we shall adopt.</p>
          <p>Moreover, we must consider according to all <lb/>
            times, whether there is any discrepancy, e. g. if <lb/>
            one defined the immortal, to be what is now an in­ <lb/>
            corruptible animal, for the animal now incorrupt- <lb/>
            17. Whether <lb/>
            the ratio of <lb/>
            time, concurs <lb/>
            with the thing <lb/>
            defined. <lb/>
            ible will be now immortal. Or does this not happen in this <lb/>
            case, for to be now incorruptible is ambiguous, for it either <pb n="486"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK VI."/>signifies that it is not now corrupted, or that it cannot now <lb/>
            be corrupted, or that it is now a thing of that kind which can <lb/>
            never be corrupted. When therefore we say that the animal <lb/>
            * Taylor and <lb/>
            Buhle insert <lb/>
            " not." <lb/>
            is now incorruptible, we say this,* that it is now <lb/>
            such an animal, as never to be corrupted, and this <lb/>
            would be the same with immortal, so that it does <lb/>
            not happen that it is now immortal. Nevertheless, if it should <lb/>
            happen that what is assigned according to the definition is <lb/>
            now, or was before, inherent, but what is according to the <lb/>
            t i. e. the thing <lb/>
            defined. <lb/>
            stated. <lb/>
            name † is not inherent, it will not be the same: <lb/>
            wherefore this place must be used as we have</p>

          </ab>
          <p>I. Observe if <unclear/> <lb/>
            y thing else <lb/>
            better ex­ <lb/>
            presses the <lb/>
            nature of the <lb/>
            thing to be <lb/>
            defined, than <lb/>
            the proposed <lb/>
            definition.</p>
          <p>IT must also be considered whether the thing de­ <lb/>
            fined is enunciated by some others, rather than by <lb/>
            that definition which was assigned, as if justice <lb/>
            (should be defined) a power distributive of the <lb/>
            equal. For he is rather a just man who deliber­ <lb/>
            ately chooses to distribute the equal, than he who <lb/>
            is able, 1 so that justice would not be a power <lb/>
            distributive of the equal, since he would be especially just, <lb/>
            who is most able to distribute the equal.</p>
          <p>2. Whether the <lb/>
            definition ad­ <lb/>
            mits degrees, <lb/>
            whilst the <lb/>
            thing defined <lb/>
            does not, and <lb/>
            vice versâ.</p>
          <p>Moreover, whether the thing receives increase, <lb/>
            but what is assigned according to the definition <lb/>
            does not receive it, or on the contrary, what is as­ <lb/>
            signed according to the definition receives, but <lb/>
            the thing, not. For it is necessary that both <lb/>
            should receive it or neither, if indeed what is as­ <lb/>
            signed according to the definition is the same with the thing. <lb/>
            3. Or both, not <lb/>
            simultaneous­ <lb/>
            ly. <lb/>
            Again, whether both indeed receive increase,2 yet <lb/>
            both do not simultaneously receive accession, as <lb/>

            what the defi­ <lb/>

            be present with the same thing, if they were the same. <lb/>
            Again, (notice) whether the one is similarly pre­ <lb/>
            sent with both things proposed, but the other not <lb/>
            similarly with both, but in a greater degree with <lb/>
            one of them.</p>
          <p>5. Or the one <lb/>
            similarly pre­ <lb/>
            sent with both, <lb/>
            but not the <lb/>
            other.</p>
          <p>Besides, whether a person accommodates the <lb/>
            definition to two things, according to each, as if <lb/>
            the beautiful (should be defined) what is pleasant <lb/>
            through sight or through hearing, and being, that <lb/>
            which is able to suffer or to act; for the same <lb/>
            6. Whether the <lb/>
            definition be <lb/>
            adapted, to <lb/>
            several things <lb/>
            according to <lb/>
            each. <lb/>
            thing at one and the same time will be beautiful and not beau­ <lb/>
            tiful ; likewise also will be being and not being. For what <lb/>
            is pleasant through hearing will be the same with the beauti­ <lb/>
            ful, so that what is not pleasant through hearing will be the <lb/>
            same with what is not beautiful, since opposites to the same <lb/>
            are the same; but what is not beautiful is opposed to what is <lb/>
            beautiful, and what is not pleasant through hearing to what <lb/>
            is pleasant through hearing. It is clear then, that what is <lb/>
            not pleasant through hearing is the same with what is not <lb/>
            beautiful; if then any thing is pleasant through the sight, but <lb/>
            not through the hearing, it will both be beautiful and not <lb/>
            beautiful,2 and similarly we may show that the same thing is <lb/>
            both being and non-being.</p>
          <p>Again, when framing definitions of genera and <lb/>

          <p>1. Observe if <lb/>
            the defined be <lb/>
            referred to <lb/>
            something, <lb/>
            whether that to <lb/>
            which it is re­ <lb/>
            ferred, has not <lb/>
            been men­ <lb/>
            tioned. <lb/>
            * Cf. Rhet. i. 10.</p>
          <p>IF indeed what is defined should either be per se, <lb/>
            or generically, a relative, consider whether that to <lb/>
            which it is referred, either per se, or generically, <lb/>
            has not been mentioned in the definition, as if <lb/>
            some one had defined science to be immutable <lb/>
            opinion, or the will, appetite unattended with <lb/>
            pain.- For the essence of every relative consists <lb/>
            in a relation to something else, since the being of every thing <lb/>
            which subsists with reference to another thing, is the same <lb/>
            with that of being in a certain respect referred to something ; <lb/>
            wherefore it is necessary to say that science, is the opinion of <lb/>
            the object of science, and the will, the appetency of good. <lb/>
            Likewise, also, if a person defined grammar to be the science <lb/>
            of letters, since it will be necessary in the definition to assign <lb/>
            that to which the thing defined, or to which the genus, is re­ <lb/>
            ferred. Also (consider), whether the definition of a certain <lb/>
            thing referred to something, is not assigned with reference to <lb/>
            the end; now the end in each thing is that which is best, or <lb/>
            t Cf. Ethics, b. <lb/>
            i. ch. 1 and 7. <lb/>
            on account of which other things subsist, † where­ <lb/>
            fore, either what is best, or what is last, must be <lb/>
            stated ; e. g. that desire is not of the pleasant, but <lb/>
            of pleasure, tor we even choose the pleasant tor the sake of this. <lb/>
            2. Whether a <lb/>
            thing be refer­ <lb/>
            red to genera­ <lb/>
            tion, or energy. <lb/>
            Examine, moreover, whether that to which a <lb/>
            thing is referred, be generation or energy, since <lb/>
            nothing of this kind is an end ; for to have ener­ <lb/>
            gized, or to have been generated, are rather the <lb/>
            end, than to generate or to energize, or is it not that such a <lb/>
            thing as this is true in all, for almost all men rather desire <lb/>
            to be delighted than to cease being delighted, so that they <lb/>
            ‡ Cf. Eth. i. <lb/>

            etc.</p>
          <p>In some cases again, (we must notice) whether <lb/>
            there is not a definition of the quantity or qual­ <lb/>
            ity, or the where, or according to the other dif­ <lb/>
            ferences ; for instance, what the quality or quan- <note type="footnote"> I An energy having its end in itself, is perfect and complete, and look­ <lb/>

            an energy. </note> <pb n="489"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. VIII.]"/>tity is of the honour, which the ambitious man desires ; for <lb/>
            all desire honour, so that it is not sufficient to say that he is <lb/>
            ambitious who desires honour, but we must add the above- <lb/>
            mentioned differences. Likewise, also, the quantity of riches <lb/>
            which the avaricious man desires (must be mentioned), or <lb/>
            what quality of pleasure the incontinent man seeks after, for <lb/>
            he is not said to be incontinent who is vanquished by any <lb/>
            pleasure whatever, but he who is so, by a certain one. Or again, <lb/>
            as men define night, the shadow of the earth, or an earth­ <lb/>
            quake, the motion of the earth,. or a cloud, the <lb/>
            condensation of the air, or wind, the motion of the <lb/>
            air, for the quantity, quality, the where, and by <lb/>

            sel's Logic, Ap­ <lb/>
            pend. B. <lb/>
            what, must be added. In like manner, as to other such things, <lb/>
            since he who omits any difference whatever, does not state what <lb/>
            is the very nature of the thing ; indeed we must always argue <lb/>
            against what is wanting, for neither will an earthquake be the <lb/>
            motion of earth in any manner, nor in any quantity, as neither <lb/>
            will wind be the motion of air in any manner, nor in any <lb/>
            quantity.</p>
          <p>Moreover, in (defining) appetites, (there will <lb/>
            be an error), if what appears is not added, and in <lb/>
            as many other things as this is adapted to; for <lb/>
            instance, that the will is the appetency of good, <lb/>
            but desire the appetency of the pleasant, yet not <lb/>
            of what appears good or pleasant. For often- <lb/>
            4. Whether in <lb/>
            the definition <lb/>
            of appetites, a <lb/>
            notion of <lb/>
            things of like <lb/>
            species, be <lb/>
            added. <lb/>
            times it escapes those who aspire after a thing that it is good <lb/>
            or pleasant, so that it is not necessary that it should be good <lb/>
            or pleasant, but only that it should appear to be so, wherefore <lb/>
            it is necessary that the explanation should be made in this <lb/>
            manner. If, on the other hand, what has been mentioned <lb/>
            should be assigned, whoever asserts that there are ideas, must <lb/>
            be led to ideas, since idea is not of any thing apparent,1 but <lb/>
            form seems to be referred to form, thus desire itself is of the <lb/>
            pleasant itself, and the will itself of the good <lb/>
            itself. † Now it will not be of the apparent good, <lb/>
            nor of the apparent pleasant, since that a thing <lb/>
            should be self-apparent good or pleasant is absurd. <lb/>

          <p>1. Observe <lb/>
            whether the <lb/>
            definition of <lb/>
            the contrary, or <lb/>
            of the cognates <lb/>
            of the thing <lb/>
            defined, can be <lb/>
            attained from <lb/>
            the definition <lb/>
            given.</p>
          <p>MOREOVER, if there be the definition of a habit, <lb/>
            take notice of what possesses it, but if the defini­ <lb/>
            tion be of what possesses, consider the habit, and <lb/>
            in like manner with regard to other things of this <lb/>
            kind; e. g. if the pleasant is what is beneficial, <lb/>
            he also who is pleased is benefited. In a word, <lb/>
            it happens after a certain manner in such defini­ <lb/>
            tions, that the definer defines more things than one,1 since he <lb/>
            who defines science, after a certain way defines ignorance <lb/>
            also, likewise the scientific and the unscientific, also to know <lb/>
            and to be ignorant, for the first being evident, the rest also in <lb/>
            some way become evident. We must examine then, in all <lb/>
            such cases, lest any thing should be discordant, employing the <lb/>
            elements which are from contraries, and conjugates.</p>
          <p>2. Whether if <lb/>
            when the genus <lb/>
            is referred to <lb/>
            any thing, the <lb/>
            species is re­ <lb/>
            ferred to the <lb/>
            species, of the <lb/>
            same.</p>
          <p>Examine too, in relatives, whether to what <lb/>
            genus is referred, to that a certain species is re­ <lb/>
            erred, for instance, if apprehension to the object <lb/>
            of apprehension, a certain apprehension also (is <lb/>
            referred) to a certain object of apprehension, and <lb/>
            if the multiple is to the sub-multiple, whether a <lb/>
            certain multiple is to a certain sub-multiple, since if there is <lb/>
            not such reference, there has been evidently an error.</p>
          <p>3. Whether the <lb/>
            definition of an <lb/>
            opposite be <lb/>
            opposed.</p>
          <p>Again, observe whether there is an opposite <lb/>
            definition of the opposite, as whether the definition <lb/>
            of the half is opposite to that of the double, since <lb/>
            if the double be that which surpasses in the equal, <lb/>
            the half will be what is surpassed in the equal. Likewise, <lb/>
            also, in the case of contraries, for the definition of the contrary <lb/>
            will be contrary according to one certain connexion of con­ <lb/>
            traries,2 thus, if that is beneficial which is productive of good, <lb/>
            what is productive of evil or is corruptive of good is injurious, <lb/>
            since one of these must necessarily be contrary to that mention­ <lb/>
            ed at first. If then neither be contrary to that mentioned at <lb/>
            first, it is clear that neither of the definitions afterwards given, <note type="footnote"> 1 Vide Hill's Logic, Notes on Definition. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Since two contrary notions can be arranged in four ways, thus: A <lb/>
            efficient of good : B destructive of good : C efficient of evil: D destructive <lb/>
            of evil; and of these also, the second and third, are contrary to the first, <lb/>
            and the first and fourth, to the third. (Vide Scheme of Opposition.) </note> <pb n="491"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. IX.]"/>can be the definition of the contrary, so that neither has the <lb/>
            definition given at first been rightly given. Never­ <lb/>
            theless, since some contraries are said to be so, <lb/>
            from the privation of another, as inequality seems <lb/>
            the privation of equality, (for things are called <lb/>
            unequal which are not equal,) it is clear that <lb/>
            4. Whether <lb/>
            habit be de­ <lb/>
            fined by priva­ <lb/>
            tion, or a con­ <lb/>
            trary by a <lb/>
            contrary. <lb/>
            what is stated to be contrary as to privation, is necessarily <lb/>
            defined through the other, but that it is no longer (necessary) <lb/>
            that what remains (should be defined) through what is pre­ <lb/>
            dicated as to privation, for each would happen to become <lb/>
            known through each. We must pay attention, therefore, to <lb/>
            such an error as this in contraries, as if some one should de­ <lb/>
            fine equality to be the contrary to inequality, since it is defined <lb/>
            through what is predicated according to privation.1 Further, <lb/>
            it is necessary that he who thus defines should use the thing <lb/>
            defined, which indeed will be evident if the definition be <lb/>
            assumed instead of the name, for there is no difference between <lb/>
            saying inequality or the privation of equality, wherefore, <lb/>
            equality will be the contrary to the privation of equality, so <lb/>
            that the thing itself (defined) will be employed. Still, if <lb/>
            neither contrary should be predicated according to privation, <lb/>
            but the definition similarly assigned, as that good is what is <lb/>
            contrary to evil, it is evident that evil will be what is contrary <lb/>
            to good, since of things thus contrary, the definition must be <lb/>
            similarly assigned. Wherefore, again, the thing defined hap­ <lb/>
            pens to be employed, as good is inherent in the definition of <lb/>
            evil, so that if good is what is contrary to evil, but there is no <lb/>
            difference between evil and the contrary to good, good will be <lb/>
            that which is contrary to the contrary of good, so that the <lb/>
            person has evidently used the thing itself.</p>
          <p>Further, (remark) whether he who assigns <lb/>
            what is predicated according to privation, has not <lb/>
            assigned that of which it is the privation ; for in­ <lb/>
            stance of habit, or of contrary, or of whatever it <lb/>
            is the privation; or whether he has not added that <lb/>
            5. Whether of <lb/>
            what is priva­ <lb/>
            tively predi­ <lb/>
            cated, the sub­ <lb/>
            ject of privation <lb/>
            is not assigned. <note type="footnote"> 1 For since inequality would be the privation of equality, if equality, <lb/>

            equality,) equality should be so defined as to be contrary to inequality, <lb/>
            i. e. equality would be the contrary to the privation of equality, so that <lb/>
            the same thing would appear to be defined through the same; contrary <lb/>
            to rule. This, therefore, Arist. adduces as another reason, why that which <lb/>
            signifies a certain <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕξις</foreign>, cannot properly be defined " per privationem." </note> <pb n="492"/>

            or in which first, it is adapted to be generated. Thus if stating <lb/>
            ignorance to be privation, a person has not said that it is a <lb/>
            privation of science, or has not added in what it is naturally <lb/>
            adapted to be produced, or having added it, has not assigned in <lb/>
            what first, as that it is not in the reasoning faculty, but in man <lb/>
            or soul, for if he has not done some one of these, he commits an <lb/>
            error. So also if he should not have said that blindness is <lb/>
            privation of sight in the eye, for it is requisite that he who <lb/>
            well assigns what (privation) is, should also assign of what it <lb/>
            is the privation, and again, what that is, which is deprived.</p>
          <p>6. Whether <lb/>
            that is defined <lb/>
            by privation, <lb/>
            which is not <lb/>
            privatively <lb/>
            predicated.</p>
          <p>Observe, also, whether a person has defined by <lb/>
            privation, that which is not predicated according <lb/>
            to privation, which fault they will appear to com­ <lb/>
            mit in the definition of ignorance, who do not <lb/>
            speak of ignorance according to negation.1 For <lb/>
            that which has not science does not seem to be ignorant, but <lb/>
            rather that which is deceived, hence we neither say, that in­ <lb/>
            animate things nor children are ignorant, so that ignorance <lb/>
            is not predicated according to the privation of science.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>1. Observe <lb/>
            whether the <lb/>
            cases of the de­ <lb/>
            finition, concur <lb/>
            with the <lb/>
            several ones, of <lb/>
            the thing de­ <lb/>
            fined.</p>
          <p>AGAIN, (examine) whether similar cases of the de­ <lb/>
            finition agree with similar cases of the noun, for <lb/>
            instance, if the beneficial is what produces health, <lb/>
            whether beneficially be productively, and that was <lb/>
            beneficial, which was productive of health.</p>
          <p>2. Whether the <lb/>
            definition, ac­ <lb/>
            cords to the <lb/>
            idea.</p>
          <p>Besides observe, whether the definition stated <lb/>
            accords to the idea, since in some things this does <lb/>
            not happen, as when Plato in his definition of <lb/>
            animals, adds "mortals," for idea will not be <lb/>
            mortal; for instance, man-self, wherefore the definition will <lb/>
            not suit the idea.2 In short, it is necessary that the definition <note type="footnote"> I As Waltz observes, we must supply here <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλλὰ κατὰ διάθεσιν</foreign> : one <lb/>
            kind of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγνοία</foreign>, being according to negation, the other <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατὰ διάθεσιν</foreign>, the <lb/>
            former is to be defined by negation, the latter not by negation. The <lb/>
            sense of the passage therefore is, that they err, who when they define <lb/>
            ignorance per privationem, do not distinguish the kind of ignorance ap­ <lb/>
            propriate to such definition. Of. Ethics, b. iii. 1. </note><note type="footnote"> I Locke says, that simple ideas alone are incapable of definition, by</note> <pb n="493"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. X.]"/>of those things to which the effective or the passive is added, <lb/>
            should be discrepant with the idea, since ideas appear to those <lb/>
            who say that there are ideas, to be impassive and immoveable, <lb/>
            and against these such arguments are useful.</p>
          <p>Yet further, in things predicated equivocally, <lb/>
            (observe) whether a person has assigned one com­ <lb/>
            mon definition of them all. For those are sy­ <lb/>
            nonymous, of which there is one definition accord­ <lb/>
            ing to the name, wherefore the assigned definition <lb/>
            is of no one of those (contained) under the name, <lb/>
            3. Whether of <lb/>
            things ambigu. <lb/>
            ous, one com­ <lb/>
            mon definition <lb/>
            is assigned of <lb/>
            all. (Vide <lb/>
            Waitz, vol. ii. <lb/>
            p. 504.) <lb/>
            since, indeed, the equivocal similarly suits every thing. The <lb/>
            definition given by Dionysius, of life, has this fault, if it be <lb/>
            the motion innate and consequent of a nourished genus, for <lb/>
            this is not more inherent in animals, than in plants, but life <lb/>
            does not seem predicated as to one species, but one kind of <lb/>
            life to be inherent in animals, and another in plants. There­ <lb/>
            fore it is possible on purpose to assign a definition thus, as <lb/>
            if all life were synonymous and predicated of one species, yet <lb/>
            nothing prevents a man while he sees the equivocation, and <lb/>
            wishes to assign the definition of the other, from being igno­ <lb/>
            rant, that he does not assign a proper definition, but one <lb/>
            common to both: notwithstanding, he will no less err if he <lb/>
            has framed it in either way. Since, indeed, some equivoca­ <lb/>
            tions escape us, the interrogator ought to use them as sy­ <lb/>
            nonyms, (as the definition of the one will not be adapted to <lb/>
            the other, so that it will appear in a way not to have been <lb/>
            defined, as the synonymous ought to suit every thing,) on the <lb/>
            other hand, the respondent must distinguish by division.1 <lb/>
            Still since some respondents say, that the synonymous is <lb/>
            equivocal, when the assigned definition does not suit every <lb/>
            thing, but that the equivocal is synonymous if it <lb/>
            suit both ;* it must be previously acknowledged, <lb/>
            or previously inferred of these, that they are <lb/>
            * The things <lb/>
            signified. <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK VI."/>more readily concur who do not foresee the result. Never­ <lb/>
            theless, if they cannot agree, but some one should say that <lb/>
            the synonymous is equivocal, because the assigned definition <lb/>
            does not suit this, observe whether the definition of this, ac­ <lb/>
            * Vide Waltz, <lb/>
            vol. ii. p. 504. <lb/>
            cords also to the rest, as it is evident it will be <lb/>
            synonymous with the rest.* If not, however, <lb/>
            there will be many definitions of the remainder. <lb/>
            since two definitions according to the name, accord to them, viz. <lb/>
            both the prior and the posterior assigned. Again, if a person <lb/>
            having defined any of those multifariously predicated, the <lb/>
            definition also not suiting all, should not indeed say that it is <lb/>
            equivocal, but should deny that the name suits all, because <lb/>
            the definition does not, against such a one we may say that it <lb/>
            is necessary to use that appellation which has been deli­ <lb/>
            vered and received, and not to disturb such things; never­ <lb/>
            theless, some must not be enunciated in a way similar to the <lb/>
            multitude.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>1. Observe <lb/>
            whether of <lb/>
            composites de­ <lb/>
            fined the indi­ <lb/>
            vidual mem­ <lb/>
            bers, be rightly <lb/>
            defined, the de­ <lb/>
            finition being <lb/>
            divided.</p>
          <p>IF the definition of some connected thing should <lb/>
            be given, consider, taking away the definition of <lb/>
            one of the things connected, whether the remain­ <lb/>
            ing (definition) be that of what remains, for if not, <lb/>
            neither it is evident will the whole be of the whole. <lb/>
            Thus, if some one defined a finite straight line <lb/>
            to be the boundary of a superficies having bound­ <lb/>
            aries, of which the middle covers the extremities, if the de­ <lb/>
            finition of a finite line is the boundary of a superficies having <lb/>
            boundaries, it is necessary that the remainder should be that of <lb/>
            + i. e. the defi­ <lb/>
            nition of a <lb/>
            straight line. <lb/>
            a straight line, † of which the middle covers the ex­ <lb/>
            tremities. Yet an infinite has neither middle nor <lb/>
            extremities, but is nevertheless straight, so that <lb/>
            the remainder is not the definition of the remainder.</p>
          <p>2. Whether of <lb/>
            a composite, the <lb/>
            definition con­ <lb/>
            lists, of as many <lb/>
            members as the <lb/>
            thing defined.</p>
          <p>Moreover (observe), if when what is defined is <lb/>
            a composite, the definition is assigned consisting <lb/>
            of as many members as the thing defined; now a <lb/>
            definition is said to be of an equal number of <lb/>
            members, when there are as many nouns and <lb/>
            verbs in the definition as there are composites. For it is <pb n="495"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. XII.]"/>necessary in such cases, that there should be a change of the <lb/>
            names, either of all, or of some of them, since there are no <lb/>
            more names stated now than before; still it is requisite that he <lb/>
            who defines should give a sentence instead of names, of all, <lb/>
            if possible, but if not, of most things. For thus also in sim­ <lb/>
            ple things, he who changes the name will have defined, as, for <lb/>
            instance, (if he should say) vestment instead of <lb/>
            garment.*1 <lb/>
             <lb/>
            * So Waitz and <lb/>
            Bekker.</p>
          <p>Besides there is a greater error, if a person has <lb/>
            made a change for names more unknown, for in­ <lb/>
            stance, a white mortal instead of a white man, for <lb/>
            neither is there a definition, and what is stated <lb/>
            thus, is less clear.</p>
          <p>3. Whether <lb/>
            more obscure <lb/>
            terms are em­ <lb/>
            ployed.</p>
          <p>Examine also in the change of names, whether <lb/>
            he does not signify still the same thing, as when <lb/>
            a person states that contemplative science is con­ <lb/>
            templative opinion, for opinion is not the same <lb/>
            with science, at least indeed it must be, if the <lb/>
            4. Whether for <lb/>
            one word, an­ <lb/>
            other has been <lb/>
            substituted,not <lb/>
            equivalent in <lb/>
            signification. <lb/>
            whole is to be the same, for contemplative is common in both <lb/>
            definitions, but what remains is different.</p>
          <p>Further, when a person changes one of the <lb/>
            names, observe whether a change is made, not of <lb/>
            the difference, but of the genus, as in the instance <lb/>
            just now stated, since contemplative is more un- <lb/>
            5. Whether in <lb/>
            changing a <lb/>
            word, a change <lb/>
            is made of the <lb/>
            genus. <lb/>
            known than science, as the one is genus, and the other differ­ <lb/>
            ice, and genus is most known of all, so that he ought to have <lb/>
            made the change not of the genus, but of the difference, since <lb/>
            this is the more unknown. Or is this reproof ridiculous, as <lb/>
            there is nothing to prevent difference from being signified by <lb/>
            a name most known, but genus not ? but if this is the case, it <lb/>
            is clear that we must make a change, as to the name of genus, <lb/>
            and not of difference. Nevertheless, if (a person) does not <lb/>
            assume a name for a name, but a sentence instead of a name, <lb/>
            it is clear that he must give the definition of difference rather <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ ἁπλα̃</foreign>, elements, (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἁπλα̃ σώματα</foreign>, Met. vii. 1, 2,) properly are not <lb/>
            definable, having not, like compound substances, received a definite form, <lb/>
            here however Aristotle means only simple notions, enunciated in such <lb/>
            terms as shall be most intelligible to the hearer: hence, variety of names <lb/>
            may be employed. Synonymous definition is one means of explaining <lb/>
            nominal signification, only however relatively, and from the accidental <lb/>
            circumstance of one word, being more familiar than another, to the hearer. <lb/>

            than of genus, since definition is given in order <lb/>

          <p>1. Observe <lb/>
            whether the as­ <lb/>
            signed defini­ <lb/>
            tions of differ­ <lb/>
            once, concur <lb/>
            with some <lb/>
            other notion <lb/>
            also.</p>
          <p>IF however the definition of difference is assigned, <lb/>
            examine whether the assigned difference is com­ <lb/>
            mon to any thing else, as when it is said that an <lb/>
            odd number is a number which has a middle, it <lb/>
            must be defined in addition, how it has a middle. <lb/>
            For number is common in both definitions, but <lb/>
            instead of odd, a sentence is assumed; yet both a line and a <lb/>
            body have a middle, though they are not odd numbers, so <lb/>
            that this would not be the definition of the odd. Still, if <lb/>
            t This para­ <lb/>
            graph is con­ <lb/>
            tained in the <lb/>

            Waitz, who <lb/>
            commences the <lb/>
            12th here. <lb/>
            that which has a middle be multifariously pre­ <lb/>
            dicated, we must explain besides, how it pos­ <lb/>
            sessos a middle, so that there will be either a <lb/>
            reproof or a syllogism, that (the thing) has not <lb/>
            been defined. †</p>
          <p>2. Whether <lb/>
            what is to be <lb/>
            defined be ex­ <lb/>
            istent ; but <lb/>
            what is ex­ <lb/>
            pressed by the <lb/>
            assigned defini­ <lb/>
            tion, be non-ex­ <lb/>
            istent.</p>
          <p>Again observe, if that of which the definition <lb/>
            is the sign, belongs to the number of beings, but <lb/>
            what is under the definition does not; e. g. if <lb/>
            white is defined colour mixed with fire, for it is <lb/>
            impossible that the incorporeal should be mixed <lb/>
            with body, so that it could not be colour mixed <lb/>
            with fire, yet it is white.</p>
          <p>3. Whether in <lb/>
            the definition <lb/>
            of a relative, <lb/>
            that to which <lb/>
            the notion to be <lb/>
            defined refers, <lb/>
            is of too wide <lb/>
            extension.</p>
          <p>Moreover, those who in (the definition of) re­ <lb/>
            latives do not distinguish to what reference is <lb/>
            made, but speak, comprehending many things, <lb/>
            either wholly or in part enunciate falsely, as if <lb/>
            some one should say that medicine is the science <lb/>
            of being. For if medicine is the science of nothing <lb/>
            which exists, it is evident that (the definition) is wholly false, <lb/>
            but if it is of one, but not of another, it is partly false ; for it <lb/>
            is necessary (to be the science) of every thing, if it is said to <lb/>
            be the science of being per se, and not accidentally, as is the <lb/>
            case with other relatives, since every object of science is re­ <lb/>
            ferred to science. Likewise, also in other things, since all <note type="footnote"> 1 Mansel's able Appendix is a good digest of the whole of this sub­ <lb/>
            ject. </note> <pb n="497"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. XIII.]"/>relatives reciprocate. Besides, if he who explains a thing not <lb/>
            per se, but accidentally, rightly explains it, each relative would <lb/>
            not be referred to one, but to many things, as there is <lb/>
            nothing to prevent the same thing, being both white, and good, <lb/>
            so that he who explains by reference to one of these, would <lb/>
            rightly explain, if he who explains from accident, does so <lb/>
            rightly. Moreover, it is impossible that such a definition as <lb/>
            this, should be peculiar to the thing assigned, for not only <lb/>
            medicine, but many other sciences are referred to what exists, <lb/>
            so that each will be the science of being ; wherefore it is clear <lb/>
            that such is the definition of no science, for it is necessary <lb/>
            that definition should be peculiar, and not common.</p>
          <p>Sometimes indeed, they define not the thing <lb/>
            (only), but a thing in a good condition, or per­ <lb/>
            fect ; such is the definition of a rhetorician, and <lb/>
            of a thief, since a rhetorician is one who is able <lb/>
            4. Whether the <lb/>
            definition be <lb/>
            assigned " non <lb/>
            rei ipsius," sed <lb/>
            "rei perfectæ" <lb/>
            to perceive what is persuasive in each thing, an. to omit <lb/>
            nothing; but a thief is one who takes on the sly, for it is <lb/>
            evident that each being such. will be good, the one a good <lb/>
            rhetorician, but the other a good thief, for not he who pilfers <lb/>
            secretly is a thief, but he who wishes to pilfer secretly.</p>
          <p>Again, (he errs,) who assigns what is of itself <lb/>
            eligible, as practical or efficient, or in any way <lb/>
            eligible on account of something else; as if he said <lb/>
            that justice, is the preserver of the laws, or that <lb/>
            wisdom, is effective of felicity, for what is effective, <lb/>
            5. Whether <lb/>
            what is eligible <lb/>
            " per se," is de­ <lb/>
            fined, as if eli­ <lb/>
            gible "propter <lb/>
            aliud." <lb/>
            or preservative, is of the number of things eligible on account <lb/>
            of something else. Or does nothing prevent what is eligible <lb/>
            for itself, being eligible for something else also ? nevertheless, <lb/>
            he errs, who thus defines what is eligible per Be, since in <lb/>
            every thing, the best especially subsists in the essence,' but it <lb/>
            is better to be eligible per se, than on account of something <lb/>
            else, so that definition ought of necessity rather to signify this.</p>

            one notion, so <lb/>
            as to make two <lb/>
            (" hoc et il­ <lb/>
            lud "). <lb/>
            these things, or that which consists of these, or <lb/>
            this together with that; for if (it should be) those <lb/>
            things, it would happen to be present with both, <lb/>
            and with neither, as if he defined justice to be temperance <lb/>
            and fortitude; for if when there are two, each has one of <lb/>
            these, both will be just, and neither; since both indeed will <lb/>
            possess justice, but each of them, not possess it. If however <lb/>
            what has been said, be not very absurd from a thing of this <lb/>
            kind happening in others also, (since nothing prevents two <lb/>
            persons having a mina, though neither of them has,) yet that <lb/>
            contraries should be present with the same, would appear to <lb/>
            be altogether absurd. Nevertheless, this would occur if one <lb/>
            of them has temperance and timidity, but the other, fortitude <lb/>
            and intemperance, for both will have justice and injustice; <lb/>
            for if justice be temperance and fortitude, injustice will be <lb/>
            timidity and intemperance. Briefly, whatever arguments may <lb/>
            be brought to prove that the parts and the whole are not the <lb/>
            same, are all useful for what has now been stated, since he <lb/>
            who thus defines, seems to say that the parts are the same as <lb/>
            the whole.1 Still the arguments are especially appropriate in <lb/>
            whatever the composition of the parts is evident, as in a house <lb/>
            and other such things; for it is evident that when the parts <lb/>
            exist, there is nothing to prevent the whole from not existing, <lb/>
            so that the parts are not the same with the whole.</p>
          <p>2. Or so as to <lb/>
            make one no­ <lb/>
            tion, but com­ <lb/>
            posed of many <lb/>
            parts (" hoc ex <lb/>
            illis ").</p>
          <p>If, on the other hand, he should say that the <lb/>
            thing defined is not these, but something consist­ <lb/>
            ing of these, we must first examine whether one <lb/>
            certain thing, is not naturally adapted to be pro­ <lb/>
            duced from these, for some things are so subsist­ <lb/>
            ent in relation to each other, as that nothing is produced from <lb/>
            them, for instance, a line and number. Besides, whether the <lb/>
            thing defined is naturally adapted to be in some one first, but <lb/>
            those of which a person says that it (the thing defined) con­ <lb/>
            sists, are not in some one first, but each in the other, since it <lb/>
            is clear that the thing would not consist of these, as in <lb/>
            what the parts are inherent, it is necessary that the whole <note type="footnote"> I He means that the whole, ought not to be defined as identical with <lb/>
            the parts, (vide Aldrich,) for, in fact, the whole may be defined triply: <lb/>
            I st, By saying it is the parts, viz. this thing and this; 2ndly, By saying <lb/>
            it consists of parts; 3rdly, By saying that the whole is this thing with <lb/>
            that. Taylor. </note> <pb n="499"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. XIII.]"/>also should be inherent, so that the whole would not be in <lb/>
            one first, but in many.1 Still if the parts and the whole are <lb/>
            in one first, consider whether they are not in the same, but <lb/>
            the whole in one, and the parts in another. Again, whether <lb/>
            the parts are destroyed together with the whole, since it is <lb/>
            necessary that it should happen vice versa, the parts being <lb/>
            destroyed that the whole should perish, but the whole being <lb/>
            destroyed it is not necessary that the parts also should be de­ <lb/>
            stroyed. Or whether the whole be good or evil, but the parts <lb/>
            neither, or vice versâ the parts indeed good or evil, but the <lb/>
            whole neither, for neither is it possible that any good or evil <lb/>
            should be produced from neither, nor that neither should be <lb/>
            produced from evil or good. Or whether the one be more <lb/>
            good than the other is evil, but what consists of these be not <lb/>
            more good than evil; for instance, if impudence (should be <lb/>
            said to consist) of fortitude and false opinion. For fortitude <lb/>
            is more a good, than false opinion is an evil, wherefore it is <lb/>
            necessary that what results from these, should be consequent <lb/>
            to the more, and should either be simply good, or more good <lb/>
            than evil. Or indeed is this unnecessary, unless each be good <lb/>
            or evil, per se, for many effective things are not per se, good, <lb/>
            but when mingled; or on the contrary each of them is good, <lb/>
            but when mingled is evil, or neither (good nor evil). What <lb/>
            has been now stated is especially apparent in the case of <lb/>
            things wholesome and hurtful, since some drugs are of such a <lb/>
            nature as that each is good, but if both be given mixed to­ <lb/>
            ether, the compound is) bad.</p>
          <p>Again, (consider whether a thing be stated to <lb/>
            consist) from the better and the worse, of which <lb/>
            the whole is not worse than the better, but is bet- <lb/>
            2. Composition <lb/>
            from the better <lb/>
            and worse. <lb/>
            ter than the worse; or is neither this necessary, unless those <lb/>
            of which the thing consists, be of themselves good ? for there <lb/>
            is nothing to prevent the whole not being good, as in the <lb/>
            instances just now adduced.</p>
          <p>Besides, whether the whole be synonymous with <lb/>
            the other part, which it ought not to be, as neither <lb/>
            S. The whole <lb/>
            synonymous <note type="footnote"> 1 For if the parts of which the definition is composed are A and B, of <lb/>

            and in C, as first, which is absurd, for the ratio of the defined notion <lb/>
            ought always to be the same as that of the definition itself. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 K 2 </note> <pb n="500"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK VI."/>with the other <lb/>
            part. <lb/>
            is it in syllables, for a syllable is synonymous with <lb/>

          <p>4. Explanation <lb/>
            of the mode of <lb/>
            composition.</p>
          <p>Moreover, (observe) whether a person has ex­ <lb/>
            plained the mode of composition. For it is not <lb/>
            sufficient to a knowledge of a thing, to say that it <lb/>
            consists of these, because not merely to consist of these, but to <lb/>
            consist of them in this manner, is the essence of composites; <lb/>
            as in the case of a house, for the composition of these in any <lb/>
            way whatever, is not a house.</p>
          <p><lb/>
            3. Or so as to <lb/>
            state the no­ <lb/>
            tion to be de­ <lb/>
            fined, is equal <lb/>
            to one joined <lb/>
            to the other, <lb/>
            (" hoc cum <lb/>
            Ulo.")</p>
          <p>If again, this thing is assigned together with <lb/>
            that, we must first state that this is with that, or <lb/>
            is the same with these, or because this is from <lb/>
            those ; for he who says, honey with water, either <lb/>
            says honey and water, or what consists of honey and <lb/>
            water, so that whichever of these he allows to be <lb/>
            the same as <lb/>
            2. Obs. of ne­ <lb/>
            gation. <lb/>
            this with that, the same things it will be suitable <lb/>
            to say, as were before urged against each of these. <lb/>
            Further, distinguishing in how many ways one <lb/>
            thing is said to be with another, consider whether this be in <lb/>
            no way with that; e. g. if it is said that one is with another, <lb/>
            either as in one same recipient, as justice and fortitude in the <lb/>
            soul; or in the same place or time, but what is asserted as to <lb/>
            these, should be by no means true, the assigned definition <lb/>
            would, it is evident, not be the definition of any thing, as this <lb/>
            3. Of identity <lb/>
            of relation. <lb/>
            is by no means with that. If, however, when the <lb/>
            things are distinguished, it is true that each is in <lb/>
            the same time, examine whether it is possible that each may <lb/>
            not be referred to the same thing; as if (some one) should <lb/>
            define fortitude to be daring joined with right conception, <lb/>
            for it is possible for a man to have the daring to defraud, <lb/>
            yet a right conception about things wholesome; still he is <lb/>
            not yet a brave man, who has this, together with that, in the <lb/>
            4. Illustration. <lb/>
            same time. Again, if both are referred to the <lb/>
            same thing, as to things medical, since nothing <lb/>
            prevents a man's having boldness and right conception about <lb/>
            medical concerns, yet nevertheless he is not a brave man who <lb/>
            possesses this with that; for neither ought each of them t&lt; <lb/>
            be referred to different things, nor to any thing casually the <lb/>
            * Vide Waltz, <lb/>
            vol. ii. 506. <lb/>
            same, but to the end of fortitude, as to warlike <lb/>
            dangers, or if there be any thing more the end, <lb/>
            than this..</p><pb n="501"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. XIV.]"/>
          <p>Some indeed, of those thus explained, by no <lb/>
            means fall under the above-mentioned division, as <lb/>
            5. Exceptions. <lb/>
            if anger is pain, joined with a notion of being despised: for <lb/>
            this would show that pain arises from a notion of this kind, <lb/>
            but that any thing should exist on account of this, is not the <lb/>
            same as for this to be with that, according to any of the modes <lb/>
            stated.</p>

            <title type="sub">CHAP. XIV.–On the Definition of the whole as a Composite, etc.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>MOREOVER, if (a person) has stated the whole to <lb/>
            be a composition of these, as that animal is a <lb/>
            compound of soul and body, first observe, whether <lb/>
            he has not stated the quality of the composition; <lb/>
            as if defining flesh or bone, he should say that <lb/>
            it is a compound of fire, earth, and air. For it <lb/>
            1. Observe <lb/>
            whether in <lb/>
            stating a com­ <lb/>
            posite, the de­ <lb/>
            finer has added <lb/>
            the quality, of <lb/>
            the compound. <lb/>
            is not enough to say it is a compound, but it must also be <lb/>
            defined of what quality it (the compound) is, since flesh is not <lb/>
            produced from the composition of these in any way whatever, <lb/>
            but flesh, from things composed in this way, and bone, from <lb/>
            those in that. It seems likely, indeed, that neither of those <lb/>
            mentioned is altogether the same with composition, as to all <lb/>
            composition, dissolution is contrary, but nothing to any of <lb/>
            those stated; besides, if it is similarly probable, that every or <lb/>
            no compound, is composition, but each animal being a com­ <lb/>
            pound is not composition, neither will any other compound <lb/>
            be composition.</p>
          <p>Again, if in like manner contraries are natur­ <lb/>
            ally adapted to be in something, and it has been <lb/>
            defined through one of them (alone), there has <lb/>
            evidently not been a definition. Otherwise, in- <lb/>
            2. If he has <lb/>
            defined by one <lb/>
            contrary, that <lb/>
            which is capa­ <lb/>
            ble of both. <lb/>
            deed, there will happen to be many definitions of the same <lb/>
            thing, for what more does he state who has defined through <lb/>
            this, than he who has done so through the other, since both <lb/>
            are in a similar manner naturally adapted to be in it ? such, <lb/>
            indeed, is the definition of the soul, if it is an essence capable <lb/>
            of science, for it is equally capable of ignorance.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding, if a person has it not in his <lb/>
            power to argue against the whole definition from <lb/>
            the whole not being known, he must attack some <lb/>
            3. Definition <lb/>
            partially im­ <lb/>
            pugnable. <lb/>
            part, if it should be known, and apparently not be well assigned, <pb n="502"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK VII."/>since the part being subverted, the whole definition also, is <lb/>
            subverted. (It is also requisite) correcting and reforming <lb/>
            such definitions as are obscure, in order to render something <lb/>
            evident, and to obtain an argument, to consider in this way: <lb/>
            since it is necessary for the respondent, either to admit what <lb/>
            is taken up1 by the interrogator, or himself to unfold what <lb/>
            that is which is signified by the definition. Yet more, as men <lb/>
            are accustomed in assemblies to introduce a law, and if what <lb/>
            4. Or to be <lb/>
            amended. <lb/>
            is introduced be better, they abrogate the former <lb/>
            law, so we must act in definitions, and another <lb/>
            definition must be introduced, since if (this) a- <lb/>
            pear better, and more to develope the thing defined, it is evi­ <lb/>
            dent that the definition laid down (previously) will be sub­ <lb/>
            verted, since there are not many definitions of the same thing.</p>
          <p>5. Advantage <lb/>
            of oneself <lb/>
            arranging a <lb/>
            definition.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, it is not the least element 2 as to <lb/>
            all definitions, to define with oneself sagaciously <lb/>
            the thing proposed, or to take up a definition which <lb/>
            has been well framed; since it is necessary, run­ <lb/>
            ning as it were to an example, to survey what is deficient in <lb/>
            the definition, and what is superfluously added, so as to be <lb/>
            better provided with arguments.</p>
          <p>Let, then, so much suffice for those points which pertain to <lb/>
            definitions.</p>

            ber,) we must consider from cases, co-ordinates <lb/>
            and opposites. For if justice be the same with <lb/>
            fortitude, a just man is also the same with a brave man, and <note type="footnote"> I rb <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκλαμβανόμενον</foreign>, quod ab interrogante assumitur. Buhle,—so <lb/>
            Taylor. It is properly that which the opponent wishes to substitute in <lb/>
            the place of what is obscure. </note><note type="footnote"> * That is not the least efficacious aid</note> <pb n="503"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. I.]"/>justly with courageously. So also with opposites, for if these <lb/>
            be the same, the opposites to these also are the same, accord­ <lb/>
            ing to any of the modes of opposition stated, since it makes <lb/>
            no difference whether we take an opposite to this or that, as <lb/>
            they are the same. Again, from efficients and corruptives, also <lb/>
            from generations, corruptions, and in short, from things which <lb/>
            subsist similarly with reference to either, for whatever are <lb/>
            simply the same, the generations and corruptions also of these <lb/>
            are the same, and besides, the efficients and corruptives.</p>
          <p>Examine also, whether of those things of which <lb/>
            one is especially said to be a certain thing, an­ <lb/>
            other also is especially predicated according to the <lb/>
            same; as Xenocrates shows that a happy and a <lb/>
            worthy life are the same,1 because a worthy and <lb/>
            a happy, are the most eligible of all lives, for the <lb/>
            most eligible, and the greatest, are one thing. Like- <lb/>
            2. Observe <lb/>
            whether where­ <lb/>
            in the thing is <lb/>
            prevalent, the <lb/>
            other also is. <lb/>
            Cf. Eth. i. ch. <lb/>
            8, et seq.; also <lb/>
            Eudem. b. i. <lb/>
            and ii. <lb/>
            wise, in other things of the same kind; yet it is necessary <lb/>
            that each of those which are said to be the greatest, or the <lb/>
            most eligible, should be one in number, otherwise it will not <lb/>
            be demonstrated that it is the same, since it is not necessary, <lb/>
            if the Peloponnesians and the Lacedæmonians are the bravest <lb/>
            of the Greeks,2 that the Peloponnesians should be the same <lb/>
            with the Lacedæmonians, as a Peloponnesian and a Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonian are not one in number. Still it is requisite that <lb/>
            one should be contained under the other, as Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            under Peloponnesians, otherwise it will happen that they are <lb/>
            better than each other, if the one be not comprehended under <lb/>
            the other, for it is necessary that the Peloponnesians should be <lb/>
            better than the Lacedæmonians, if the one be not contained un­ <lb/>
            der the other, for they are better than all the rest (of the Greeks). <lb/>
            So also it is necessary that the Lacedæmonians should be better <lb/>
            than the Peloponnesians, for these also are better than all the <lb/>
            rest, so that they are better than each other. It is clear then, <lb/>
            that what is said to "be best, and greatest, ought to be one in <lb/>
            number, if we would show that it is the same, for which reason <note type="footnote"> 1 The various opinions entertained of the nature of happiness, Aristotle <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK VII."/>also Xenocrates does not demonstrate, for a happy, and a <lb/>

            they should be the same. because both are most eligible, but <lb/>
            that one should be under the other.</p>
          <p>3. Whether <lb/>
            each is equiva­ <lb/>
            lent to the same <lb/>
            third thing.</p>
          <p>Again consider, whether one (of the things <lb/>
            proposed) is the same (as a third thing), also whe­ <lb/>
            ther another (is the same with it), for if both are <lb/>
            not the same with it, it is clear that (they are not <lb/>
            the same) with each other.</p>
          <p>4. If the acci­ <lb/>
            dents are the <lb/>
            same.</p>
          <p>Moreover, observe from the accidents of these, <lb/>
            and from those things to which these are acci­ <lb/>
            dents, since whatever are accidents to the one, <lb/>
            must of necessity be also accidental to the other, and to what <lb/>
            one of them happens, the other must also happen; now if any <lb/>
            discrepancy subsists amongst these, they are evidently not <lb/>
            the same.</p>
          <p>5. If both be in <lb/>
            the same cate­ <lb/>
            gory, the same <lb/>
            genus, and <lb/>
            have the same <lb/>
            differences.</p>
          <p>Notice also, whether both are not in one genus <lb/>
            of category, but the one denotes quality, the other <lb/>
            quantity or relation ; again, whether the genus of <lb/>
            each is not the same, but the one is good, and the <lb/>
            other evil, or the one virtue, and the other sci­ <lb/>
            ence: or whether the genus is indeed the same, yet there are <lb/>
            not the same differences predicated of each, but of the one, <lb/>
            that it is contemplative science, of the other, that it is prac­ <lb/>
            tical, and so of other things.</p>
          <p>6. If both be <lb/>
            simultaneously <lb/>
            increased and <lb/>
            diminished.</p>
          <p>Further, from the more, if one indeed receives <lb/>
            the more, but the other not, or if both indeed re­ <lb/>
            ceive it, yet not at the same time; thus, he who <lb/>
            loves more, does not more desire intercourse, so <lb/>
            that love, and the desire of intercourse, are not the same.</p>
          <p>7. If both are <lb/>
            equal, having <lb/>
            undergone the <lb/>
            same accession <lb/>
            or diminution.</p>
          <p>Besides, from addition, if each being added to <lb/>
            the same, does not make the whole the same, or <lb/>
            if the same being taken away from each, the re­ <lb/>
            mainder is different; as if some one said, that the <lb/>
            double of the half, and the multiple of the half, were the same. <lb/>
            For the half being taken away from each, the remainder ought <lb/>
            to signify the same, yet it does not, for the double, and the <lb/>
            multiple, do not denote the same.</p>
          <p>8. Whether the <lb/>
            consequences <lb/>
            t.r both, upon a <lb/>
            given hypothe-</p>
          <p>Observe however, not only whether any im­ <lb/>
            possibility now happens on account of the thesis, <lb/>
            but also whether it is possible to be from the hy­ <pb n="505"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. II.]"/>pothesis; as (happens) to those who say that a <lb/>
            vacuum, and a plenum of ai <unclear>r</unclear>, are the same, since <lb/>
            sis, be discre­ <lb/>
            pant. <lb/>
            it is clear that if the air should depart, there will not be a <lb/>
            less, but a greater vacuum, yet there will no longer be a <lb/>
            plenum of air. Hence, a certain thing being supposed, whe­ <lb/>
            ther false or true, (it makes no difference,) one of them is sub­ <lb/>
            verted, but the other not, hence they are not the same.</p>
          <p>In a word, from those things which are in any <lb/>
            way predicated of each, and of which these are <lb/>
            predicated, we must consider if there be any dis­ <lb/>
            crepancy; for whatever are predicated of the one, <lb/>
            9. Whether the <lb/>
            same things <lb/>
            may be predi­ <lb/>
            cated of each. <lb/>
            ought likewise to be predicated of the other, and of which the <lb/>
            one, is predicated, it is necessary that the other also, should be.</p>
          <p>Besides, since the same thing is predicated mul­ <lb/>
            tifariously, examine whether after some other <lb/>
            mode they are the same, since it either is not <lb/>
            necessary, or not possible that those which are <lb/>
            the same in species or genus, should be the same in <lb/>
            10. Whether <lb/>
            they are the <lb/>
            same generic­ <lb/>
            ally, or specific­ <lb/>
            ally, not nu­ <lb/>
            merically. <lb/>
            number, but we will investigate whether they are the same in <lb/>
            this way, or not in this way.1</p>
          <p>Again, whether the one can possibly be with­ <lb/>
            out the other, for they would not be the same.</p>
          <p>11. Whether <lb/>
            one can subsist <lb/>
            without the <lb/>
            other.</p>

          <p>THE places then pertaining to the same thing, <lb/>
            are said to be so many,2 but it is clear from what <lb/>
            has been stated, that all places belonging to the <lb/>

            confirming de­ <lb/>
            finition.</p>
          <p>To subvert definition then, we must make our at­ <lb/>
            tempt always in this manner, and through these <lb/>
            things; but if we desire to confirm, it is first <lb/>
            necessary to know, that no one, or few, of those who discuss, <lb/>
            syllogistically infer definition, but all assume such sort of <lb/>
            thing, as a principle; for instance, both those who are con­ <lb/>
            versant with geometry and numbers, and other such instruc­ <lb/>
            tions : next, that it is the business of another treatise accu. <lb/>
            rately to assign both what definition is, and how it is neces­ <lb/>
            sary to define, but now only so much must be observed, as is <lb/>
            sufficient for our present purpose, viz. that it is possible there <lb/>
            may be a syllogism of definition, and of the very nature of a <lb/>
            thing. For if definition be a sentence denoting the very na­ <lb/>
            ture of a thing, and it is necessary that things predicated in <lb/>
            the definition should alone be predicated in (reply to) what a <lb/>
            thing is, but genera and differences are predicated in reply to <lb/>
            this question, it is evident that if any one assumes those <lb/>
            things only to be predicated in reference to what a thing is, <lb/>
            that the sentence which contains these, will evidently be a <lb/>
            definition, since there cannot be possibly another definition, <lb/>
            as nothing else is predicated of the thing, in reference to <lb/>
            what it is.</p>

            and difference, <lb/>
            are to be <lb/>
            elicited from <lb/>
            contraries; so <lb/>
            that the defini­ <lb/>

            be constructed <lb/>

            t The defini­ <lb/>
            tion.</p>
          <p>Evidently then, there may be a syllogism of <lb/>
            definition, but from what we ought to construct <lb/>
            it, has been more accurately determined in other <lb/>
            places; * these same places, however, are useful <lb/>
            for the proposed method. For in contraries, and <lb/>
            other opposites, we mu it observe whole sentences, <lb/>
            observing them also, according to parts; as if <lb/>
            the oppositet (be the definition) of the opposite, <lb/>
            it is necessary that what is stated, should be § of <lb/>
            the thing proposed. Since however, there are <lb/>
            many connexions of contraries, we must select <lb/>
            from them, that definition which especially appears <pb n="507"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. III.]"/>contrary;1 whole sentences then, must be considered in the <lb/>
            manner stated, but according to parts, thus.2 In the first <lb/>
            place, (it must be shown) that the assigned genus is rightly <lb/>
            assigned, for if the contrary be in the contrary genus, but <lb/>
            the thing proposed is not in the same, it will clearly be in the <lb/>
            contrary (genus), since contraries must of necessity either be <lb/>
            in the same, or in contrary genera. We also think that con­ <lb/>
            trary differences are predicated of contraries, as of white and <lb/>
            black, for the one is dissipative, the other is collective of <lb/>
            vision. Wherefore, if contraries are predicated of a contrary, <lb/>
            the assigned (differences) would be predicated of the thing <lb/>
            proposed, so that since both genus and differences are rightly <lb/>
            assigned, it is evident that what is assigned, will be a defini­ <lb/>
            tion. Or it is not necessary that contrary differences should <lb/>
            be predicated of contraries, unless they should be contraries <lb/>
            in the same genus, yet of those of which the genera are con­ <lb/>
            trary, there is nothing to prevent the same difference being <lb/>
            predicated of both; e. g. of justice and injustice,3 for the one <lb/>
            is a virtue, but the other a vice of the soul, so that the word <lb/>
            “of the soul,” being a difference, is predicated of both, since <lb/>
            there is of the body also, a virtue and a vice. Nevertheless, <lb/>
            this at least is true, that the differences of contraries are either <lb/>
            contrary or the same; if then a contrary be predicated of a <lb/>
            contrary, but not of this, it is evident that the difference <lb/>
            adduced, will be predicated of this. In short, since definition <lb/>
            consists of genus and differences, if the definition of the con­ <lb/>
            trary be manifest, the definition also of the thing proposed, <lb/>
            will be manifest. For as what is contrary, is either in the <lb/>
            same, or in a contrary genus, and likewise either contrary <lb/>
            or the same differences, are predicated of contraries, it is evi­ <lb/>
            dent, that the same genus will be predicated of the thing pro­ <lb/>
            posed, which was also of the contrary; but the differences <lb/>
            are contrary, either all or some, yet the remainder are the <lb/>
            same,4 or on the contrary, the differences are the same, but <note type="footnote"> I From the connexions of contraries, (vide b. ii. ch. 7,) that must be <lb/>

            the construc­ <lb/>
            tion of defini­ <lb/>
            tion.</p>
          <p>Besides, (we must argue) from cases, and con­ <lb/>
            jugates, since genera must of necessity follow <lb/>
            genera, and definitions be consequent to defini­ <lb/>
            tions : thus, if oblivion be the loss of science, to <lb/>
            become oblivious, will be to lose science, and to <lb/>
            have forgotten, to have lost science; any one then of the <lb/>
            before-mentioned particulars being admitted, the rest must <lb/>
            necessarily be admitted. Likewise, also, if destruction be a <lb/>
            dissolution of substance, to be destroyed will be for substance <lb/>
            to be dissolved, and destructively will be dissolvingly, and if <lb/>
            what is destructive is dissolvent of substance, destruction is <lb/>
            a dissolution of substance ; similarly also, of other things, <lb/>
            wherefore any one being assumed, all the rest will be conceded.</p>
          <p>4. And those <lb/>
            things also, <lb/>
            which have <lb/>
            mutual similar <lb/>
            subsistence.</p>
          <p>Also, (we must argue) from things which sub­ <lb/>
            sist similarly as to each other ; for if the salubrious <lb/>
            is productive of health, the productive of a good <lb/>
            habit will be effective of a good habit, and the <lb/>
            beneficial will be productive of good. For each of the above <lb/>
            named, subsists similarly with regard to its proper end, so that <lb/>
            if the definition of one of them, is to be effective of the end, <lb/>
            this will also be the definition of each of the rest.</p>
          <p>5. How the <lb/>
            comparison of <lb/>
            other defini­ <lb/>
            tions, conduces <lb/>
            to the forma­ <lb/>
            tion of defini­ <lb/>
            tion.</p>
          <p>Moreover, from the more and the similar, in as <lb/>
            many ways as it is possible to confirm, comparing <lb/>
            two with two, thus; if this is more the definition <lb/>
            of that, than something else of another thing, but <lb/>
            the less is a definition, the more also (will be a <lb/>
            definition); also if this is similarly the definition <lb/>
            of that, and another thing of something else, if the one is a <lb/>
            definition of the other, the remainder will also be of the re­ <lb/>
            mainder. When however, one definition is compared with <lb/>
            two things, or two definitions with one, the consideration from <lb/>
            the more is of no use, as neither can there possibly be one <lb/>
            definition of two things, nor two of the same. <note type="footnote"> ences may be contrary, but others alike : since if contrary differences are <lb/>
            joined with the summum genus, there arise thence, inferior contrary <lb/>
            genera, which may possess the same differences. Cf. Waitz. </note></p><pb n="509"/>

          <p>THAT it is more difficult to confirm, than to sub­ <lb/>
            vert definition, is evident from what will next be <lb/>
            said, since it is not easy for him (who interro­ <lb/>
            gates) to perceive and take from those who are <lb/>
            1. Reason why <lb/>
            definition is <lb/>
            more easily <lb/>
            subverted,than <lb/>
            constructed. <lb/>
            interrogated, propositions of this kind ; as that of the things <lb/>
            in the assigned definition, one is genus, but another difference, <lb/>
            and that genus and differences are predicated (in reply) to <lb/>
            what a thing is. Still without these there cannot possibly be <lb/>
            a syllogism of definition, as if certain other things also are <lb/>
            predicated of a thing, in respect of what it is, it is dubious <lb/>
            whether what is stated, or something else, is its definition, <lb/>
            since definition is a sentence signifying what is the very na­ <lb/>
            ture of a thing.1 Now it is evident from what follows, for it <note type="footnote"> 1 If besides genus and difference, other things are necessarily joined <lb/>
            with the nature of the thing to be defined, the proposed definition which <lb/>
            consists of the genus and differences, will appear deficient, and therefore <lb/>
            questionable. For in order to render the definition conclusive, it is re­ <lb/>
            quisite (vide ch. 3) that the genus and differences alone, be admitted to <lb/>
            express the true nature of the thing to be defined. </note> <pb n="510"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK VII."/>is more easy to conclude one, than many things. To the sub­ <lb/>
            verter indeed, it is sufficient to dispute against one (part of the <lb/>
            definition), (for having subverted any one part, we shall have <lb/>
            subverted the definition,) but it is necessary for the confirmer, <lb/>
            to prove that all those things are inherent, which are in the <lb/>
            definition. Moreover, the confirmer must adduce an universal <lb/>
            syllogism, since it is requisite that of every thing of which a <lb/>
            name is predicated, the definition should be predicated, and <lb/>
            besides this, vice versa, if the assigned definition is to be pro­ <lb/>
            per. On the other hand, it is not requisite for the subverter <lb/>
            to demonstrate the universal, since it suffices to show that the <lb/>
            definition is not verified of any one of the things under the <lb/>
            name, if also it should be necessary to subvert universally, <lb/>
            neither thus, is reciprocation necessary in subversion, for it is <lb/>
            enough that the subverter show universally, that the definition <lb/>
            is not predicated of some one of those things, of which the <lb/>
            name is predicated. On the contrary, it is not necessary to <lb/>
            show that the name is predicated, of what the definition is not <lb/>
            * Buhle and <lb/>
            Taylor insert <unclear/> <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐδὲ</foreign>. <lb/>
            predicated.-. Further, if also it is present with <lb/>
            every thing under the name, yet not with it alone, <lb/>
            the definition will be subverted.</p>
          <p>2. The same to <lb/>
            be said of pro­ <lb/>
            perty.</p>
          <p>In like manner, it is with regard to property <lb/>
            and genus, since in both, it is easier to subvert, <lb/>
            than to confirm. About property then, it is evi­ <lb/>
            dent from what we have stated, as for the most part property <lb/>
            t Of words. <lb/>
            is assigned in conjunction,† so that it is possible <lb/>
            to subvert by taking away one word ; but he <lb/>
            who confirms, must of necessity conclude every thing by syl­ <lb/>
            logism. Now almost every thing else, which may be said of <lb/>
            definition, will also be suitable to say of property, since the <lb/>
            confirmer ought to show that it is inherent in every thing <lb/>
            under the name, but it suffices for the subverter to show it <lb/>
            non-inherent in one thing ; if also it is inherent in every thing, <lb/>
            3. Also of ge­ <lb/>
            nus. <lb/>
            but not in it alone, thus too, it becomes sub­ <lb/>
            verted, as was observed about definition. Concern­ <lb/>
            ing genus indeed, (it is evident, because it is <lb/>
            necessarily confirmed only in one way, if a person shows it <lb/>
            present with every individual; nevertheless, it is subverted in <lb/>
            two ways, for both if it has been shown not present with any, <lb/>
            and not with a certain one, what was assumed in the beginning <lb/>
            is subverted. Moreover, it is not enough, for the confirmer <pb n="511"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. V.]"/>to show that it is inherent, but also it must be shown that it is <lb/>
            inherent, as genus ; but to the subverter it is enough to show <lb/>
            it non-inherent, either in a certain or in every individual: <lb/>
            still it seems, as in other things, to destroy, is easier than to <lb/>
            produce, so in these, subversion, is easier than confirmation.</p>
          <p>In the case of accident, we can more easily sub­ <lb/>
            vert, than construct the universal, for the con­ <lb/>
            firmer must show that it is present with every, <lb/>
            but the subverter need only show it non-inherent <lb/>
            in one. On the contrary, it is easier to confirm, <lb/>
            4. Accident, if <lb/>
            universal, more <lb/>
            easily subvert­ <lb/>
            ed ; if particu­ <lb/>
            lar, more easily <lb/>
            confirmed. <lb/>
            than to subvert the particular, as it suffices for the confirmer <lb/>
            to show it present with a certain one, but the subverter must <lb/>
            show that it is present with none.</p>
          <p>It appears also clear why it is the easiest thing <lb/>
            of all, to subvert definition, for many things being <lb/>
            asserted in it, very many are given;1 but from <lb/>
            the greater number, a syllogism is more quickly <lb/>
            made, since it is likely that error should arise <lb/>
            5. Definition <lb/>
            of all things <lb/>
            most easily de. <lb/>
            stroyed, most <lb/>
            hardly confirm <lb/>
            ed. <lb/>
            in many, more than in few, things. Moreover, it is pos­ <lb/>
            sible to argue against definition through other <lb/>
            things. also, since whether the sentence be not <lb/>
            appropriate, or whether what is assigned be not <lb/>
            genus, or something: of those in the definition be <lb/>
            * As from the <lb/>
            topics belong­ <lb/>
            ing to genus, <lb/>
            property, acci­ <lb/>
            dent. <lb/>
            non-inherent, the definition will be subverted; but against <lb/>
            other things, neither can we assume those arguments which <lb/>
            are derived from definitions, nor all others, † since <lb/>
            those only which belong to accident, are common <lb/>
            to all the particulars mentioned.t For it is neces­ <lb/>
            sary that each of the things stated § should be <lb/>
            inherent, if however genus is not inherent as pro­ <lb/>
            perty, the genus will not yet be subverted ; like­ <lb/>
            t As the above <lb/>
            named. <lb/>
            t i. e. to the <lb/>
            attributes or <lb/>
            problems. <lb/>
            § Accident, <lb/>
            genus, etc. <lb/>
            wise, also property need not be inherent as genus, nor acci­ <lb/>
            dent as genus or property, but merely inherent. Wherefore <lb/>
            it is impossible to argue from some things to others, except in <lb/>
            definition ; hence, it is evident that to subvert definition is <lb/>
            the easiest thing of all, but to confirm it the hardest, since we <lb/>
            must syllogistically infer all those particulars, (viz. that all the <note type="footnote"> 1 " By which it may be subverted," Taylor: for since definition, con­ <lb/>
            sists of more parts, than genus, etc., and more requisites are to be observed <lb/>
            in its proper disposition (vide lib. vi.), it is more readily impugned than <lb/>
            the others. </note> <pb n="512"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK VIII."/>above-named are inherent, and that what is assigned is genus, <lb/>
            and that the sentence is appropriate,) and besides these, that <lb/>
            the sentence denotes the very nature of a thing, and it is <lb/>
            necessary to do this well.</p>
          <p>6. Of all the re­ <lb/>
            mainder, pro­ <lb/>
            perty is the <lb/>
            easiest of sub­ <lb/>
            version.</p>
          <p>Among other things, property is especially a <lb/>
            thing of this sort, for it is easier to subvert it, <lb/>
            from its consisting, for the most part, of many <lb/>
            things, and it is most difficult of confirmation, be­ <lb/>
            cause we must combine many things, and besides, show that <lb/>
            it is inherent in this alone, and reciprocates with a thing.</p>
          <p>7. Accident, of <lb/>
            all, most diffi­ <lb/>
            cult of subver­ <lb/>
            lion. and most <lb/>
            easily confirm­ <lb/>
            ed.</p>
          <p>Of all however, the easiest is to confirm acci­ <lb/>
            dent, for in others, not only inherency, but inhe­ <lb/>
            rency thus, must be shown ; but as to accident it <lb/>
            suffices to show its inherency only. On the other <lb/>
            hand, accident is the hardest to subvert, because <lb/>
            the fewest things are given in it, for it is not signified in acci­ <lb/>
            dent, over and above other things, how it is inherent, so that <lb/>
            subversion is possible in two ways ; as to the rest, either by <lb/>
            showing non-inherency, or non-inherency in this way; but in <lb/>
            accident, it is impossible to subvert, except by showing that <lb/>
            it is not inherent.</p>
          <p>The places then, through which we shall be well provided <lb/>
            with arguments against the several problems, have almost <lb/>

            the question­ <lb/>
            ist; what is <lb/>
            common to the <lb/>
            dialectician and <lb/>
            to the philoso­ <lb/>
            pher, and what <lb/>
            Is not. Cf. Rhet. <lb/>
            iii. 13, et seq.</p>
          <p>WE must next speak about order, and in what <lb/>
            manner it is necessary to interrogate. In the <lb/>
            first place then, he who is about to interrogate <lb/>
            should discover a place whence he may argue, <lb/>
            secondly, he should interrogate and arrange the <lb/>
            several particulars to himself; thirdly and lastly, <lb/>
            he should advance them against another person. <lb/>
            Now as to the discovery of the place, its consideration per­ <lb/>
            tains alike to the philosopher and to the dialectician; but how <lb/>
            to arrange these, and to interrogate, is the peculiar province of <lb/>
            the dialectician, since the whole of this refers to another per­ <pb n="513"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. I.]"/>son ; but to the philosopher, and to him who investigates by <lb/>
            himself, it is no concern, if the particulars through which the <lb/>
            syllogism is constructed, be true and known, whether the re­ <lb/>
            spondent admits them or not, because of their nearness to the <lb/>
            original question, and from their foreseeing the result; they <lb/>
            even perhaps would endeavour that axioms should be espe­ <lb/>
            cially known and approximate, as from these, scientific syl­ <lb/>
            logisms subsist.</p>
          <p>The places then, whence we must derive (argu­ <lb/>
            ments), have been enunciated before, but we must <lb/>
            speak of order, and interrogation, distinguishing <lb/>
            the propositions which are to be assumed, besides <lb/>
            such as are necessary.1 Now those are called ne­ <lb/>
            cessary, through which a syllogism arises, but <lb/>
            2. Certain pro­ <lb/>
            positions dis­ <lb/>
            tinguished, <lb/>
            which, non-ne­ <lb/>
            cessary, are as- <lb/>
            Burned by rea- <lb/>
            Boners. Vide <lb/>
            b. ii.—vii. <lb/>
            those assumed besides these, are four; for (they are so), either <lb/>
            for the sake of induction that the universal may be granted; <lb/>
            or for amplifying what is said; or for concealment of the con­ <lb/>
            clusion; or for greater perspicuity of expression. Besides <lb/>
            these however, we must assume no proposition, but endeavour <lb/>
            through these to increase," and to interrogate: <lb/>
            those which are for concealment (are to be as­ <lb/>
            * What is said. <lb/>
            sumed) for the sake of contention, yet since the whole of this <lb/>
            treatise is with reference to another person, it is necessary to <lb/>
            use these also.2</p>
          <p>The necessary (propositions) then through which <lb/>
            a syllogism arises, must not be advanced imme­ <lb/>
            diately, but we must retire to what is highest ;3 <lb/>
            for instance, not requiring it to be granted, that <lb/>

            are necessary <lb/>
            are to be con­ <lb/>

            gued remotely. <lb/>
            there is the same science of contraries, if it is desired to as­ <lb/>
            sume this, but of opposites, for when this is laid down, it will <lb/>
            be syllogistically inferred that there is the same of contraries <lb/>

            some by induction, but others by syllogism ; such however as <lb/>
            are very perspicuous, we shall propose (straightway), for the <lb/>
            result is always more obscure in receding and induction; and <lb/>

            singulars to the universal, and from things known to those <lb/>
            unknown ; those however are more known, which are accord­ <lb/>

            tions, but some one from among such as are use­ <lb/>
            ful to these. Again, we ought not to mention <lb/>
            the conclusions,t but afterwards conclude them in <lb/>
            a body; for thus he (the interrogator) will recede <lb/>
            farthest from the original thesis. In a word, it is requisite <lb/>
            that he who secretly interrogates, should so question, that <lb/>

            Now this will be particularly done through the <lb/>
            before-mentioned mode, for when the last conclu­ <lb/>
            sion only is mentioned, it will not be evident how <lb/>
            it results, from the respondent not foreseeing from what the <lb/>
            inference would be drawn, the previous syllogisms not having <lb/>
            been dissected, but the syllogism of the conclusion would be <lb/>
            least of all dissected, when we do not lay down its assump­ <lb/>
            tions, but those by which the syllogism arises.2</p>

          <p>Moreover, it is useful to take the axioms from <lb/>
            which the syllogisms arise, not continuously, but <note type="footnote"> 1 i. e. if he does not admit the universal proposition, viz. that there is <lb/>

            ously.</p>
          <p>It is right also, to assume in the definition, as <lb/>
            far as we can, an universal proposition, not in the <lb/>
            things themselves,' but in their conjugates, for (the <lb/>
            respondents) deceive themselves by paralogism, <lb/>
            when the definition is assumed in the conjugate, <lb/>
            6. Rule to be <lb/>
            observed as to <lb/>
            assuming an <lb/>
            universal prop. <lb/>
            in the defini­ <lb/>
            tion. <lb/>
            as if they did not grant the universal; e. g. if it should be <lb/>
            necessary to assume that the angry man desires vengeance on <lb/>
            account of apparent contempt, and anger should be assumed <lb/>
            to be the desire of vengeance on account of apparent con­ <lb/>
            tempt, for it is evident when this is assumed, we should have <lb/>
            the universal, which we prefer. Where how­ <lb/>
            ever, it. is proposed in the very things them­ <lb/>
            selves, † it frequently happens that the respondent <lb/>
            rejects it. because he has rather the objection to <lb/>

            the subject of <lb/>
            discussion. <lb/>
            it; e. g. that the angry man does not desire vengeance, for we <lb/>
            are angry with our parents, and yet do not desire vengeance. <lb/>
            Perhaps therefore, this objection is not enough, as in some <lb/>
            things it is sufficient vengeance only to grieve, and to produce <lb/>
            repentance, nevertheless it has something persuasive, in order <lb/>
            that what is proposed, may not seem to be denied without <lb/>
            reason: to the definition however, of anger, it is not similarly <lb/>
            easy to find an objection.</p>
          <p>Again, (we ought) to propose as if we did not <lb/>
            propose on account of the thing itself but for <lb/>
            the sake of something else, for (respondents) are <lb/>
            t The subject <lb/>
            of discussion. <lb/>
            cautious of such things as are useful against the thesis. <lb/>
            In short, as much as possible the (interrogator) <lb/>
            ought to render it obscure, whether he desires <lb/>
            to assume the thing proposed or the opposite, for <lb/>
            when what is useful against the argument is <lb/>
            doubtful, they § rather lay down that which seems <lb/>
            true to them.</p>

          <p>Moreover, we must interrogate through simili­ <lb/>
            tude, for the universal is persuasive and more <lb/>
            latent;|| for instance, that as there is the same <lb/>

            trary, since there is the same sense, there is also <lb/>
            the same science. This, indeed, is like, yet not <lb/>
            the same as, induction, for there - the universal is <lb/>
            assumed from singulars, but in similars, what is <lb/>

            1. Self-objection.</p>
          <p>2. Custom.</p>
          <p>Again, it behoves him sometimes to object to <lb/>
            himself, since the respondents have no suspicion <lb/>
            towards such as appear to argue justly,1 and it is <lb/>
            also useful to say besides this, that such a thing <lb/>
            is what is usually asserted, since they are reluct­ <lb/>
            ant to change what is usual when they have no ob­ <lb/>
            jection; at the same time, because they use such things them- <lb/>

            indifference. <lb/>
            selves they are careful not to change them. Besides, <lb/>
            (we must not be earnest, although the thing be <lb/>
            altogether useful, for men make greater opposition against per­ <lb/>
            sons in earnest; also (we should propose as by comparison, <lb/>

            for what is proposed on account of something <lb/>
            else, and is not of itself useful, men rather admit. <lb/>
            Again, we must not propose that, which ought to <lb/>
            be assumed, but that to which this is necessarily <lb/>
            for men more readily concur, from the inference <lb/>
            from this not being similarly manifest, and when <lb/>
            this, † is assumed that ‡ also, is assumed. In the last <lb/>
            place, let the interrogator ask that, which he wishes <lb/>
            especially to assume, for (the respondents) will at <lb/>
            first especially deny, because most interrogators <lb/>
            assert those things first, about which they are most <lb/>
            in earnest.2 Against some however, propose such things first; <lb/>
            since those who are difficult to be persuaded, concede at first, <lb/>
            especially if the result is not perfectly apparent, but at the last <lb/>
            they assent with difficulty; likewise, also, they who think <lb/>
            themselves acute in answering, for admitting many things, at <note type="footnote"> 1 These rules are the digest of crafty practice, by a full developmen <lb/>

            readily, trusting to habit, and apprehending that they will <lb/>
            suffer no inconvenience. Moreover, we must ex­ <lb/>
            tend the discourse and insert things which are of <lb/>
            no use to it, as they do, who write falsely, for when <lb/>

            stated, but for ornament, we must employ induc­ <lb/>

            each thing of this kind adorns a speech, yet it is not necessary <lb/>
            that it should be adduced, in order to the conclusion.</p>
          <p>For the sake of perspicuity, we must adduce <lb/>

            or hand, for a painter may have colour, and a cook a foot, not <lb/>
            his own,) employing division in such things, the interrogation <lb/>

            it is necessary by removing that, in which the objection con­ <lb/>

            health being a less good than good bodily habit, a greater evil <lb/>
            is opposed, since disease is a greater evil than cachexy, there­ <lb/>
            fore in this case also we must take away that in which the ob­ <lb/>
            jection consists, for when it is removed, the person would more <lb/>
            readily concede, as that a greater evil is opposed to a greater <lb/>
            good, unless one thing co-introduces another, as a good bodily <lb/>
            habit, does health. Still, not only must this be <lb/>
            done when there is an objection, but also if with­ <lb/>
            out an objection there should be a denial,. from <lb/>

            to what particular thing it is not so, but if he should not con­ <lb/>
            cede when he is asked for his objection, he will not be able to <lb/>
            allege it. Propositions indeed of this kind are such as are <lb/>
            partly false and partly true, for in these it is possible, when <lb/>
            we have taken away, to leave the remainder true ; nevertheless, <lb/>
            if (when interrogating), he proposes in many things, (the other) <lb/>
            does not adduce an objection, concession must be claimed, <lb/>

            When we can syllogistically infer the same <lb/>

            does not dispute, whether the syllogism be in this, <lb/>

          <p>It is necessary indeed to propose such as sub­ <lb/>
            sist thus in many things, but the objection either <lb/>
            is not at all, or is not easily perceived, since not <lb/>

          <p>Yet we ought not to make the conclusion a <lb/>
            question, for otherwise the (respondent) denying, <lb/>
            a syllogism does not appear to have been framed. <lb/>
            For frequently they deny when the person does <lb/>
            not question, but infers as a consequent, and doing this, they <lb/>
            do not appear to confute, to those who do not see that, it hap­ <lb/>
            pens from the things laid down; when then he interrogates, <lb/>
            not asserting that the conclusion follows, but the other denies, <lb/>
            a syllogism does not entirely appear to have been framed.</p>
          <p>8. Not every <lb/>
            universal, <lb/>
            is a dialectic <lb/>
            prop. <lb/>
            * Cf. b. i. ch.10.</p>
          <p>Neither does it seem that every universal is a <lb/>
            dialectic proposition,* as "what is man ?” or "in <lb/>
            how many ways is good predicated?" since a dia­ <lb/>
            lectic proposition is one, to which we can answer <lb/>
            either yes or no, which is impossible to those above-named. <lb/>
            Hence, such interrogations are not dialectic unless the person <lb/>
            speaks by defining or dividing, as; "is good predicated in this <lb/>
            or in that way ?" for the answer to such things is easy either by <lb/>
            affirmation or denial. Wherefore we must endeavour to set <lb/>
            forth such propositions in this way, and at the same time it is <lb/>
            perhaps just to ask him in how many ways good is predicated, <lb/>
            when the (interrogator) divides and proposes, but he (the <lb/>
            respondent) by no means concedes.</p>
          <p>9. The same <lb/>

            not to be re­ <lb/>

            rogated.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, whoever questions for a long time <lb/>
            one reason, interrogates badly, for if he who is <lb/>
            interrogated answers the question, it is evident <lb/>
            that the querist) asks many or oftentimes the <lb/>
            same questions, so that he either trifles or has not a syllogism, <lb/>
            since every syllogism is from a few things ; but if he does not <lb/>
            answer, why does he not reprove him, or depart ?</p>

            easy to maintain, the same hypothesis; such are <lb/>
            those which are first and last naturally, for those <lb/>
            which are first require definition, but the last are <pb n="521"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. III.]"/>concluded through many things, by him who wishes to assume <lb/>
            continuously from the first, or the arguments appear captious, <lb/>
            as we cannot demonstrate any thing without beginning from <lb/>
            appropriate principles, and continuing in a regular series, as <lb/>
            far as the last. Respondents, therefore, neither think fit to <lb/>
            define, nor consider whether the questionist defines, but when <lb/>
            it is not evident what the proposition is, it is not easy to at­ <lb/>
            tack it;1 now, such a thing especially occurs about princi­ <lb/>
            ples, for other things are demonstrated through these, but <lb/>
            these cannot possibly be through others, but it is necessary to <lb/>
            make known each thing of this kind by definition.</p>
          <p>Those also are difficult to impugn which are <lb/>
            very near the principle, since it is impossible to <lb/>
            provide many arguments against them, since there <lb/>
            are but few media between the thing itself and <lb/>

            the principle, through which it is necessary that things subse­ <lb/>
            quent to them should be demonstrated. Still, of <lb/>
            all definitions, those are most difficult to impugn <lb/>
            which employ such names, as at first are uncertain <lb/>

            ousry ; besides which, it is unknown, whether they are predi­ <lb/>
            cated by the definer properly or metaphorically. For from <lb/>
            their obscurity a person does not obtain arguments, but from <lb/>
            his being ignorant whether such things are said metaphori­ <lb/>
            call, he is without reprehension.</p>
          <p>In short, every problem, when it is difficult of <lb/>
            opposition, must be supposed either to stand in <lb/>
            need of definition, or as among the number of <lb/>

            faults incident to its omission hinted at, of which omission also, Aristotle <lb/>
            shows that they are most frequently guilty, who, attacking the position of <lb/>
            an adversary, either do not require, at first, a definition of the thing, to be <lb/>
            given, which forms the subject of dispute, or do not examine its accuracy, <lb/>
            when given. Definition may be compared to the key, which locks the door <lb/>
            of the room, and having put this key into his pocket by the admission of <lb/>
            his opponent, the disputant cuts off all means of escape from his adversary, <lb/>
            who otherwise, after an hour's argument, often slips through his fingers, <lb/>
            with the plausible excuse, that he meant a different thing to that which <lb/>
            the reasoner supposed. Breaches of Contract, Polemical Arguments, etc., <lb/>
            furnish fertile proofs of the result of non-attention to this rule. </note> <pb n="522"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK VIII."/>very thing which occasions the doubt is to be referred ; for the <lb/>
            mode being evident, it is clear that it will be necessary, either <lb/>
            to define, or to divide, or to prepare middle propositions, since <lb/>
            through these, the last are demonstrated.</p>
          <p>5. Difficulty <lb/>
            arising from a <lb/>
            badly enunci­ <lb/>
            ated definition.</p>
          <p>In many theses also, when the definition is not <lb/>
            well delivered, it is not easy to discourse and <lb/>
            argue, as whether one thing is contrary to one or <lb/>
            many things, but contraries being defined pro­ <lb/>
            perly, we can easily collect whether there can be possibly <lb/>
            many contraries of the same thing or not. In the same way <lb/>
            also, as to other things which require definition, and in <lb/>
            * i. e. demon­ <lb/>
            strated, <lb/>
            mathematics, some appear not easily described- <lb/>
            through a defect of definition, as that a line <lb/>
            which laterally cuts a superficies divides simi­ <lb/>
            larly both a line and a spaced When, however, the defini­ <lb/>
            t Of cutting <lb/>
            similarly. <lb/>
            tion† is stated, the assertion is forthwith evi­ <lb/>
            dent, for both the spaces and the lines have a <lb/>
            correspondent division,2 but this is the definition <lb/>
            of the same sentence.3 In short, the first elements when <lb/>
            definitions are laid down, as what is a line, and what a circle, <lb/>
            are easy of demonstration, except that we cannot advance <lb/>
            many arguments against each of these, from there not being <lb/>
            many media, but if the definitions of the principles be not laid <lb/>
            down, it is difficult, and perhaps altogether impossible ; like­ <lb/>
            wise also in those, which belong to disputations.</p>
          <p>6. Whether <lb/>
            things are to <lb/>
            be conceded, <lb/>
            which are more <lb/>
            difficult than <lb/>
            the problem <lb/>
            itself.</p>
          <p>It ought not, therefore, to escape us, that when <lb/>
            a thesis is opposed with difficulty, it has experi­ <lb/>
            enced some one of the above-mentioned (modes); <lb/>
            since, however, it is more difficult to discuss an <lb/>
            axiom and a proposition than a thesis, a person <lb/>
            may doubt whether things of this kind are to be <lb/>
            laid down or not. For if he does not admit them, but thinks <lb/>
            fit to discuss this also, he will enjoin a greater work than <lb/>
            what was at first laid down, but if he does admit, he will <note type="footnote"> 1 For instance, a parallelogram with a line drawn through two of its <lb/>

            down, but if (it is necessary) to syllogize through things more <lb/>

            by the learner, except it be more known, but must be laid <lb/>
            down by him who exercises himself, if it only appear true ? <lb/>
            so that it is evident that the querist, and the teacher ought, not <lb/>

            necessary that the conclusion be probable, but if that, is pro­ <lb/>
            bable, that this, should be improbable, for the querist always <lb/>
            concludes the opposite, of the thesis. If however what is laid <lb/>
            down, be neither improbable, nor probable, the conclusion also <lb/>
            will be of this sort, but since he who syllogizes properly, de­ <lb/>

            simply, nor that which seems indeed, but is less <lb/>
            apparent than the conclusion, for the thesis being improbable, <lb/>
            the conclusion is probable, so that it is necessary that all the <lb/>
            assumptions, should be probable, and more so, than what is <lb/>

            the thesis be simply probable, it is clear that the conclusion is <lb/>
            simply improbable. Whatever then seems (true) must be laid <note type="footnote"> I At the risk of appalling the reader, by the immense length of the <lb/>

            he can, against the questions asked); the fourth and worst <lb/>
            objection is that which relates to time, for some object such <lb/>
            things as require more time for discussion, than the present <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>1. Reprehen­ <lb/>
            sion of argu­ <lb/>
            ments them­ <lb/>
            selves, differ­ <lb/>
            ent from the <lb/>
            reprehension of <lb/>
            persons em­ <lb/>
            ploying them.</p>
          <p>THE reprehension of an argument is not the same <lb/>
            with respect to the argument itself, and when it <lb/>
            forms the subject of interrogation, as often the <lb/>
            person questioned is the cause of the argument <lb/>
            not being well discussed, because he does not <lb/>
            allow things from which it might be properly <lb/>
            argued against the thesis, since it does not belong to the other <lb/>
            alone, that the common work is properly effected. Wherefore <lb/>
            sometimes it is necessary to argue against the speaker, and <lb/>
            not against the thesis, when the respondent, out of contumely, <lb/>
            makes observations contrary to the questionist; hence they <lb/>
            cause through perverseness, the exercises to be contentious <lb/>
            and not dialectic. Besides, since arguments of this kind are <lb/>
            for the sake of exercise and experiment, and not of doctrine, <lb/>
            it is evident that not only what is ti ue, but also what is false, <lb/>
            must be collected, neither always through what is true, but <lb/>
            sometimes also through the false, for often when what is true is <lb/>
            laid down, it is necessary for the disputant to subvert it, so that <lb/>
            false assertions must be proposed.3 Sometimes, also, when the <lb/>
            false is laid down, it must be subverted through falsities, <lb/>
            since there is nothing to prevent things which have no exist­ <lb/>
            ence, seeming to some person to be, rather than those which are <lb/>
            true, so that when the argument subsists from things appear­ <lb/>
            ing (true) to him, he will be more persuaded than profited. <lb/>
            2. Contentious <lb/>
            argument to be <lb/>
            avoided. <lb/>
            Still, it is necessary that he who would transfer <lb/>
            the reasoning properly, should transfer it dialec­ <lb/>
            tically, and not contentiously, as the geometrician <lb/>
            (argues) geometrically, whether what is concluded be false or <lb/>
            true; of what nature however, dialectic syllogisms are, we <lb/>
            have shown before. Yet since he is a depraved associate, who <lb/>
            impedes a common work, it is evident that (this is true also) in <lb/>
            arguments, for there is something common proposed in these <lb/>
            also, except amongst those who dispute, for the sake of con- <note type="footnote"> I Cf. Rhetoric, b. ii. ch. 25. 2 Cf. Whately, b. iv. ch. 2 and 3. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Because the false is not concluded from the true, though the true <lb/>
            may be from the false. Vide in. Post. b. ii. ch. 2—4 </note> <pb n="531"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. XI.]"/>test, as it is impossible for both these to obtain the same end, <lb/>
            for they cannot vanquish more than one. Now it is of nc <lb/>
            consequence whether this is done, through the answer or <lb/>
            through the question, since he who interrogates contentiously, <lb/>
            disputes badly, also he who in his answer does not admit what <lb/>
            is apparent, nor receives what the questionist wishes to in­ <lb/>
            quire. Wherefore it is clear from what we have stated, that <lb/>
            we must not similarly reprehend an argument per se, and the <lb/>
            questionist; since nothing hinders the argument being bad, <lb/>
            but the questionist discoursing against the respondent in the <lb/>
            best way possible; for against the perverse, it is not perhaps <lb/>
            possible, to frame immediately, such syllogisms as some one <lb/>
            would, but such as he can, frame.</p>
          <p>Since also it is indefinite when men assume <lb/>
            contraries, and when things (investigated) in the <lb/>
            beginning, (for often speaking by themselves they <lb/>
            3. Origin of bad <lb/>
            arguments. <lb/>
            assert contraries, and having before denied, they afterwards <lb/>
            admit, hence when questioned they frequently allow contra­ <lb/>
            ries, and that which (was investigated) in the beginning,) bad <lb/>
            arguments, must necessarily arise. The respondent however <lb/>
            is the cause, by not admitting some things, yet admitting such <lb/>
            as these, wherefore it is clear that we must not similarly re­ <lb/>
            prehend querists and arguments.</p>
          <p>Now there are five reprehensions of an argu­ <lb/>
            ment per se, the first indeed, when from the ques­ <lb/>
            tions asked nothing is concluded, neither the pro­ <lb/>
            position, nor, in short, any thing ; all or the <lb/>
            greatest part of those, from which the conclusion <lb/>
            (arises), being either false or improbable; and nei- <lb/>
            4. Reprehen­ <lb/>
            sions of an ar­ <lb/>
            gument per <unclear>se</unclear> <lb/>
            five in number. <lb/>
            Vide Whately <lb/>
            on Fallacies, <lb/>
            and Reasoning. <lb/>
            ther things being taken away, nor being added, nor some be­ <lb/>
            ing taken away, but others added, the conclusion is produced. <lb/>
            The second is, if there be not a syllogism against the thesis <lb/>
            from such things, and in such a way, as was mentioned before. <lb/>
            The third, if there is indeed a syllogism, from certain addi­ <lb/>
            tions, but these should be worse than those questioned, and <lb/>
            less probable than the conclusion. Again, if certain things <lb/>
            are taken away, for sometimes men assume more than is ne­ <lb/>
            cessary, so that the syllogism does not result from these be­ <lb/>
            ing (granted); further, if from things more improbable and <lb/>
            less credible than the conclusion, or if from things true in- <note type="footnote"> 2 a 2 </note> <pb n="532"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK VIII."/>deed, but which require more labour to demonstrate than the <lb/>
            problem.</p>
          <p>5. Argument <lb/>
            may be repre­ <lb/>
            hensible per se, <lb/>
            yet commend­ <lb/>
            able as to the <lb/>
            problem, or <lb/>
            vice versâ. Cf. <lb/>
            Whately, b. iv.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding, we need not require the syl­ <lb/>
            logisms of all problems to be alike probable and <lb/>
            convincing ; for some things investigated, are <lb/>
            straightway by nature more easy, but others more <lb/>
            difficult, so that he will discourse well, who argues <lb/>
            from such as are of the greatest possible proba­ <lb/>
            bility. Wherefore, it is evident then, there is not the same <lb/>
            reprehension of an argument, as to what is laid down in the <lb/>
            question, and when it is per Be, for nothing prevents an argu­ <lb/>
            ment being per Be reprehensible, but commendable as to the <lb/>
            * Because it is <lb/>
            the best argu­ <lb/>
            ment attain­ <lb/>
            able as to that <lb/>
            problem. <lb/>
            problem; * and again, vice versa, praiseworthy <lb/>
            per Be, but reprehensible as to the problem, when <lb/>
            it is more easy to conclude from many things <lb/>
            probable and true.1 For sometimes an argument, <lb/>
            even when conclusive, may be worse than what is incon­ <lb/>
            clusive, when the one concludes from foolish things, the pro­ <lb/>
            blem not being such, but the other requires such as are proba­ <lb/>
            ble and true, and the argument does not consist in the things <lb/>
            assumed. Still, it is not just to reprehend those who con­ <lb/>
            clude the true through the false, for the false must of neces­ <lb/>
            sity always be collected through the false, yet sometimes it is <lb/>
            possible to collect the true, even through the false, indeed it <lb/>
            is evident from the Analytics.</p>
          <p>6. When the <lb/>
            thesis is not re­ <lb/>
            futed—distinc­ <lb/>
            tion between a <lb/>
            philosophema, <lb/>
            an epicheirema, <lb/>
            a sophism, and <lb/>
            an aporema. <lb/>
            t Vide infra; <lb/>
            also Anal. Pr. <lb/>
            it. 2.</p>
          <p>When the before-named argument is a demon­ <lb/>
            stration of something, if there is something else <lb/>
            which has nothing to do with the conclusion, <lb/>
            there will not be a syllogism about it;f but if <lb/>
            there should appear (to be one), it will be a <lb/>
            sophism, not a demonstration. Now, a philoso­ <lb/>
            phema is a demonstrative syllogism; an epichei­ <lb/>
            rema, a dialectic syllogism ; but a sophism, a con­ <lb/>
            tentious syllogism; and an aporema, a dialectic syllogism of <lb/>
            contradiction.2 <note type="footnote"> 1 Cf. Waitz. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 I extract the following scheme, which presents the relative position <lb/>
            of the several terms used here, from Dr. Hessey's Schema Rhetorica; <lb/>

            results from necessary, the epicheirema and enthymem from probable, <lb/>
            and the sophism from apparently, but not really, probable, propositions. </note></p><pb n="533"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. XI.]"/>
          <p>Tf moreover any thing should be demonstrated <lb/>
            from both probable (propositions), yet not simi­ <lb/>
            larly probable, there is nothing to prevent what <lb/>

            but if one be probable, but the other neither (probable nor <lb/>
            improbable), or if one be probable, but the other not, if they <lb/>
            be similarly so, (the conclusion) will also similarly be and not <lb/>
            be, but if one is more, (the conclusion) will follow that which <lb/>
            is more.</p>
          <p>Now this also is an error in syllogisms, when <lb/>
            a person demonstrates through more, what is pos­ <lb/>
            sible through fewer things, which also are inhe­ <lb/>
            rent in the argument; as if any one, (in order to <lb/>
            show) that one opinion is better than another, <lb/>
            should require it to be granted, that each thing <lb/>

            which are not <lb/>
            evident, as to <lb/>
            the cause <lb/>
            whence the <lb/>
            reasoning pro­ <lb/>

            that the object of opinion is truly itself; wherefore it is more <lb/>
            than certain other things, but what is said to be more, is <lb/>
            referred to the more, and the opinion itself is true, which will <lb/>
            be more accurate than certain things; yet it was required to <lb/>
            be granted that opinion itself is true, and that each thing it­ <lb/>
            self most eminently subsists, wherefore this opinion itself is <lb/>
            more accurate. Now, what is the fault here ? It is that it <lb/>
            makes the cause latent, from which the reasoning is derived. <note type="footnote"> The aporema is, as Aristotle observes, a dialectic syllogism of contradic­ <lb/>

          <p>I. When an <lb/>
            argument is <lb/>
            clear.</p>
          <p>AN argument is most clear in one way, and that <lb/>
            the most popular, if it be so concluded, as to re­ <lb/>
            quire no further interrogation ; but in another <lb/>
            way, which is especially said to be, when things are assumed, <lb/>
            * i. e. through <lb/>
            prop., not of <lb/>
            themselves <lb/>
            known, but <lb/>
            proved through <lb/>
            pro-syllogisms. <lb/>
            from which (the conclusion) necessarily results, but <lb/>
            ( the argument) concludes through conclusions;. <lb/>
            moreover, if there is any thing deficient, of what <lb/>
            is very probable.</p>
          <p>2. False in <lb/>
            four ways.</p>
          <p>Again, an argument is called false in four <lb/>
            ways; one when it appears to conclude, yet does <lb/>
            not do so, which is called a contentious syllogism ; <lb/>
            another when it concludes, indeed, that which does not per­ <lb/>
            tain to the proposed (problem), and this happens especially in <lb/>
            arguments leading to the impossible; or it concludes perti­ <lb/>
            nently to what is laid down, yet not after an appropriate <lb/>
            method,2 and this is when a non-medical argument appears <lb/>
            medical, or the non-geometrical to be geometrical, or the non­ <lb/>
            t i. e. an argu­ <lb/>
            ment is said to <lb/>
            be false. <lb/>
            dialectic to be dialectic, whether the result be <lb/>
            false or true. Another way,† if it concludes <lb/>
            through falsities, and of this the conclusion will <lb/>
            be sometimes false, and sometimes true, as the false is always <lb/>
            ‡ 11th chap. <lb/>
            also An. Pr. b. <lb/>
            ii. ch. 2—4. <lb/>
            concluded through falsities, but it IS possible that <lb/>
            the true may be so even from things not true, as <lb/>
            was said also before.‡</p>
          <p>3. If it be false, <lb/>
            whether it is <lb/>
            the fault of the <lb/>
            arguer, or of <lb/>
            the argument. <lb/>
            § That he has <lb/>
            stated a false <lb/>
            argument.</p>
          <p>That the reasoning, then, is false, is rather the <lb/>
            fault of the arguer than of the argument, and <lb/>
            neither is it always the fault of the arguer but <lb/>
            when it escapes him,§ since of many truths per se, <lb/>
            we admit rather that, which from things especially <lb/>
            appearing (probable), subverts something true.3 <lb/>
            For such (reasoning) is a demonstration of other truths, as it <lb/>
            || i. e. in the <lb/>
            demonst. ad <lb/>
            impossibile. <lb/>
            is requisite that some one of the positions || should <lb/>
            not altogether be, so that there will be a de­ <lb/>
            monstration of this;4 but if it should conclude <note type="footnote"> I Vide Whately's Logic, b. ii. ch. 2, 1 : also App. i. 29; Rhet. ii. 24, 25. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 i. e. when the reasoning concludes against the thesis, as if it were a <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. XIII.]"/>the true through false and very silly assertions, it will be <lb/>
            worse than many, which collect the false, and such will be the <lb/>
            reasoning, collecting the false. Wherefore, it is <lb/>
            evident that the first consideration of the argu­ <lb/>
            ment per se will be whether it concludes ; next, <lb/>
            whether (it concludes) the true or false ; thirdly, <lb/>

            from what assertions, for if from those which are false but <lb/>
            probable, it is a logical argument, but if from what are (true) <lb/>
            yet improbable, it is faulty. If, also, they are false, and very <lb/>
            improbable, the argument is evidently bad, either simply, or <lb/>
            with respect to the thing (discussed).</p>

          <p>As to what was (investigated) in the beginning and con­ <lb/>
            traries, how the questionist demands a postulate <lb/>
            according to truth, indeed, has been told in the <lb/>
            Analytics,* but must now be discussed according <lb/>
            to opinion.</p>
          <p>* Vide An. Pr. <lb/>
            b. it. ch. 16. <lb/>
            Cf. Whately <lb/>
            Log. b. iii. 13.</p>
          <p>Now, men appear to beg what was in the be­ <lb/>
            ginning in five ways, most evidently, indeed, and <lb/>
            primarily, if any one begs the very thing which <lb/>
            1. Petitio prin­ <lb/>
            cipii occurrent <lb/>
            in five ways. <lb/>
            ought to be demonstrated; this, however, docs not easily escape <lb/>
            notice, as to the thing itself, but rather in synonyms,1 and <lb/>
            wherein the name and the definition signify the same thing. <lb/>
            Secondly, when what ought to be demonstrated particularly, <lb/>
            any one asks for, universally, as when endeavouring to show <lb/>
            there is one science of contraries, he demands it to be alto­ <lb/>
            gether granted, that there is one of opposites, for he seems to <lb/>
            beg together with many things, that which he ought to de­ <lb/>
            monstrate per se. Thirdly, if any one proposing to demon­ <lb/>
            strate the universal, begs the particular; as if when it is <lb/>
            proposed (to be shown), that there is one science of all con­ <lb/>
            traries, some one should require it to be granted, that (there is <lb/>
            one) of certain contraries; for he also seems to beg per Be <lb/>
            separately, that which he ought to show, together with many <note type="footnote"> hypo an absurdity follows. The subject of this chapter is fully expounded <lb/>
            by the observations of Whately upon argument. </note><note type="footnote"> I Synonyms here, have a different meaning to that attached to them <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK VIII."/>things. Again, if a person dividing (the problem) begs the <lb/>
            thing proposed for discussion; as if when it is necessary to <lb/>
            show that medicine belongs to the healthy, and the diseased, <lb/>
            he should claim each of these, to be granted separately. Or <lb/>
            if some one should beg one of these, which are necessarily <lb/>
            consequent to each other, as that the side of a square is incom­ <lb/>
            mensurate with the diameter, when he ought to show, that the <lb/>
            diameter is incommensurate with the side.1</p>
          <p>2. Of the <lb/>
            " begging " of <lb/>
            contraries. <lb/>
            * As that plea­ <lb/>
            sure is good, <lb/>
            and is not evil.</p>
          <p>Contraries, are begged in as many ways, as the <lb/>
            original question ; for first, if any one should de­ <lb/>
            mand the opposites, affirmation and negation; 0 <lb/>
            secondly, contraries according to opposition, as <lb/>
            that good and evil are the same; thirdly, if a man <lb/>
            claiming universal to be granted should require contradiction <lb/>
            particularly, as if assuming one science of contraries, he should <lb/>
            desire it to be granted that there is different science of the <lb/>
            wholesome and the unwholesome, or begging this, endeavoured <lb/>
            to assume opposition as to the universal. Again, if a man <lb/>
            should beg the contrary to what happens necessarily through <lb/>
            the things laid down; if also, a person should not indeed <lb/>
            assume the opposites themselves, but should claim two such <lb/>
            S. Difference <lb/>
            between them. <lb/>
            things from which there will be an opposite con­ <lb/>
            tradiction. Still, there is a difference between <lb/>
            assuming contraries and a petitio principii, be­ <lb/>
            cause the error of the one belongs to the conclusion, (for having <lb/>
            respect to this, we say that the original question is begged,) <lb/>
            but contraries are in the propositions, from these subsisting in <lb/>
            a certain way, as to each other.</p>

          <p>FOR the exercise and practice of such arguments t <lb/>
            as these, we must, in the first place, be accus­ <lb/>
            tomed to convert arguments; for thus we shall <lb/>
            be better provided for the subject of discussion, <lb/>
            and we shall obtain a knowledge of many argu- <note type="footnote">The varieties of the Petitio Principii given here, do not correspond with <lb/>
            those mentioned by Aldrich, and the second, is not in form, distinguish­ <lb/>

            A </note> <pb n="537"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. XIV.]"/>ments in a few. For to convert, is when we have changed <lb/>
            the conclusion with the remaining interrogations, to subvert <lb/>
            one of the data, since it is necessary, if the conclusion is not, <lb/>
            that some one of the propositions should be subverted, as <lb/>
            when all these are laid down, the conclusion would of necessity <lb/>
            be. We must also consider the argument as to every thesis, <lb/>
            both that it is so, and that it is not so, and having discovered <lb/>
            (this), the solution must be forthwith investigated, for it will <lb/>
            happen thus, that at the same time, we shall be exercised both <lb/>
            in question, and answer. If also we have nobody else, (we <lb/>
            must dispute) to ourselves; also selecting arguments about <lb/>
            the same thesis, we must compare them side by side ; for this <lb/>
            produces a great abundance, for the purpose of constraining <lb/>
            conviction, and affords great aid to confutation, <lb/>
            when a person is well supplied with arguments <lb/>
            both pro and con; since, thus, it happens that <lb/>
            care is taken against contraries. Neither is it a <lb/>
            3. Also an indi­ <lb/>
            vidual scrutiny <lb/>
            of arguments, <lb/>
            pro and con. <lb/>
            small instrument to knowledge and philosophical wisdom, to <lb/>
            be able to perceive and to have perceived the results of each <lb/>
            hypothesis, for it remains rightly to select one of these.1 <lb/>
            Now there is need for a thing of this kind of a naturally good <lb/>
            disposition, and a good disposition is in reality, thus to be able <lb/>
            to select properly the true, and to avoid the false; which those <lb/>
            naturally (good) are able to perform well, since <lb/>
            they who properly love, and hate what is adduced, <lb/>
            judge well, what is best.*2 <lb/>

          <p>it is likewise requisite to know well, the argu­ <lb/>

            * Vide Whate­ <lb/>
            ly, b. iii. iv. <lb/>
            these the respondents are often dissatisfied. More­ <lb/>
            over, we ought to abound in definitions, and to have <lb/>
            at hand those, both of the probable and of the pri­ <lb/>
            mary, since through these, syllogisms are formed.- <lb/>
            We must endeavour also to possess those, into <lb/>
            which the other disputations generally fall; for as in geometry <lb/>
            it is of importance to be exercised about the elements; and in <lb/>
            arithmetic, to be prompt in the multiplication of numbers in a <lb/>
            regular series up to ten, also contributes greatly to the know­ <lb/>
            ledge of the multiplication of the other numbers besides ; so <lb/>
            in like manner in arguments, the being prompt about prin­ <lb/>
            ciples, and tenaciously to retain propositions in the memory <lb/>
            (are of great service). For as places laid down in the mne­ <lb/>
            monic (part of the soul) only, immediately cause us to remem­ <lb/>
            ber them, so these also, will render a person more syllogistic, <lb/>
            in consequence of his regarding these (propositions), defined <lb/>
            numerically. A common proposition also, rather than an <lb/>
            argument, should be committed to memory, since to abound <lb/>
            with principle and hypothesis is moderately difficult.1</p>
          <p>4. An adver­ <lb/>
            sary's single <lb/>
            argument, to be <lb/>
            divided into <lb/>
            many.</p>
          <p>Moreover, we must be accustomed to make one <lb/>
            argument many, concealing as obscurely as possi­ <lb/>
            ble,2 which sort of thing may be done, if a person <lb/>
            very much recedes from the alliance of those <lb/>
            things which are the subject of discussion. Such arguments <lb/>
            indeed, as are especially universal, will be capable of experi­ <lb/>
            encing this ; as that there is not one science of many things, <lb/>
            for tlius it is in relatives, and in contraries, and in con­ <lb/>
            jugates.3</p>
          <p>5. And to be <lb/>
            rendered as <lb/>
            universal, as <lb/>
            possible.</p>
          <p>Besides, we ought to make universal records <lb/>
            of arguments, even if that discussed, be particu­ <lb/>
            lar ; for thus it will be possible to make one argu­ <lb/>
            ment many, so also in rhetorical enthymemes. <note type="footnote"> 1 i. e. it is easier than to commit the whole argument to memory. </note><note type="footnote"> I i. e. we ought to split our opponent's argument into many, in order to <lb/>
            render demonstration a harder task to him; but we must do this as <lb/>

            to points least connected with the subject. Examples of this kind are <lb/>
            continually found in Voltaire, and writers of that stamp. For instances <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. XIV.]"/>Nevertheless, the disputant ought as much as <lb/>
            possible to avoid the universal in introducing <lb/>
            syllogisms; and it is also requisite always to ob­ <lb/>
            serve whether the arguments are conversant with <lb/>
            6. The con­ <lb/>
            trary mode to <lb/>
            be adopted, by <lb/>
            the disputant <lb/>
            himself. <lb/>
            things common, for all particular are conversant with uni­ <lb/>
            versal, and the demonstration of the universal is inherent in <lb/>
            that which is particular, because nothing can be <lb/>
            syllogistically concluded without universals.* <lb/>
            * So Waitz.</p>
          <p>We should assign the exercise of inductive <lb/>
            arguments to a young man, but of syllogistic ones <lb/>
            to a practised man;1 we should also endeavour to <lb/>
            assume propositions from those who are skilful in <lb/>

            allotted. <lb/>
            syllogisms, but comparisons from the inductive, for in these <lb/>
            each are exercised. In short, from dialectic ex­ <lb/>
            ercise, we must endeavour to draw either a syllo­ <lb/>
            gism about something, or a solution, or a proposi- <lb/>

            rightly questioned, whether himself or another, and about <lb/>
            what each is. For from these the power (of discussion arises), <lb/>
            and exercise is on account of power, especially in propositions <lb/>
            and objections; since, in short, he is the dialectician, who is <lb/>
            ready to propose and to object; but to propose is to make <lb/>
            many things one, (since it is requisite for that to be assumed <lb/>
            in the whole, to which the argument belongs,) but to object <lb/>
            (is to make) one many, since a man † either di­ <lb/>
            vides or subverts, partly admitting, and partly <lb/>
            denying the proposition. <lb/>
            t Who objects.</p>
          <p>It is requisite still, not to dispute with every <lb/>
            one, nor to exercise ourselves against any casual <lb/>
            person, for it is necessary to employ bad arguments <lb/>
            against some, since against him, who altogether <lb/>
            9. Not every <lb/>
            one is to be <lb/>
            disputed with. <lb/>
            Montaigne's <lb/>
            Ess. xxv. <lb/>
            tries to seem to elude us, it is just indeed, by all means, to try <lb/>
            to draw a conclusion, yet it is not becoming. Wherefore, it is <lb/>
            not proper readily to engage with casual persons, since de­ <lb/>
            praved disputation will necessarily occur; for even those who <lb/>
            practise themselves, cannot forbear disputing contentiously.2 <note type="footnote"> 1 For the reason of this, cf. Rhet. b. ii. ch. 12, and Whately, b. iv, <lb/>

            nicious effects. But Aristotle in this treatise employs the same method <lb/>
            as he employed in the Topics, for in the first place, he instructs the so­ <lb/>
            phist, unfolding the invention and disposition of deceptions and the <lb/>
            sophistical method of interrogating, and in the next place, he instructs <lb/>

            Conformably with this distinction he divides the treatise into two books, <lb/>

            its more extended sense to an imaginary opponent, and the processes in­ <lb/>

          <p>That some, then, are syllogisms, but that others <lb/>

            as this happens in other things through a certain <lb/>
            similarity, so also does it occur in arguments. <lb/>
            For some have a good habit,* others appear (to <lb/>

            these, some are really silver, and others gold, but others <lb/>
            again, though they are not, appear so to sense ; for instance, <lb/>
            substances like litharge and tin (seem) silvery, others dyed <lb/>

            make their observations as it were, withdrawing to a dis­ <lb/>
            tance ; for syllogism is from certain things so laid down, as <lb/>
            that we collect something of necessity, different <lb/>
            from the things laid down, through the posita; but <lb/>
            an elenchus is a syllogism with contradiction of <lb/>
            the conclusion. Some, indeed, do not do this, <lb/>

            fact, the examination of fallacies is clearly extralogical, except when the <lb/>
            consequence is formally invalid, and this treatise of Aristotle is only an <lb/>
            account of the " pseudo-refutations," as Mansel calls them, in use amongst <lb/>

            the objects which they aim at, who contend, and <lb/>
            strive, in disputations, and these are five in number: <lb/>

            he who is healed, is well; but sitting, he rose, and a sick man, was made <lb/>
            well; therefore, sitting, he stands, and a sick man is well." Thus, in <lb/>
            the minor there is an equivocation, because when it is said that a man <lb/>
            sitting, or being ill, does, or suffers something, two things are signified, <lb/>
            first, that when he sits, he does something, and secondly, that he who <lb/>
            before sat, now does something; so that being taken in one sense in the <lb/>
            premise, and in another in the conclusion, there is no confutation. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Ambiguity is a fallacy founded upon a certain sentence signifying <lb/>
            many things, e. g. the sentence given is ambiguous, because it may equally <lb/>

          <p>Ambiguity therefore, and equivocation, are in <lb/>
            these modes, but the following belong to composi­ <lb/>
            tion ; as that he who sits, can walk, and that he <lb/>
            who does not write, may write. For it does not signity the <lb/>
            same if a person speaks separately and conjointly, that it is <lb/>
            possible that a person sitting, may walk, and that one not <lb/>
            writing, may write, and this in a similar manner, if some one <lb/>
            should connect (the words), that he who does not write, <lb/>
            writes; since it signifies that he has a power by not writing, <lb/>
            of writing. If however he does not join (the words, it signi­ <lb/>
            fies), that he has a power, when he does not write, of writing; <lb/>
            also he now learns letters, since he learned what he knows; <lb/>
            moreover, that he who is able to carry one thing only, is able <lb/>
            to carry many.1</p>

            Whately iii. 11.</p>
          <p>Concerning division, (the arguments are such <lb/>
            as these, that five is two and three, and odd and <lb/>
            even,2 and that the greater is equal for it is so <lb/>
            much, and something more; for the same sentence divided, and <lb/>
            conjoined, does not always appear to signify the same thing ; as <note type="footnote"> 1 The example given here, shows a wrong composition of clauses in a <lb/>
            sentence capable of two punctuations, the sense varying according as <lb/>
            " sedentem " is joined with " possibile est," or with " stare;" so also the <lb/>
            fallacy of division will include the separation of clauses which ought to <lb/>
            be united. In the fallacy of combination, the same term is taken, first, in <lb/>
            a distinctive, and then in a collective sense ; in the fallacy of division, the <lb/>
            argument contains the word, first, employed in a collective, or combined <lb/>
            application, and subsequently in one divided or distributed. There are <lb/>
            some excellent examples in Hill. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 For if five is divided into three and two, three is an odd, and two an <lb/>

            passed upon Alcibiades, for his imperfect utterance, by Aristoph. (Vesp. <lb/>
            45). The fallacy, as Aristotle observes, can hardly occur in Greek sen­ <lb/>
            tences, delivered viva voce, because of the accent and breathing used, <lb/>
            but that it might happen in writings, from the Greeks, in his time, not <lb/>
            marking written words with accent and spiritus. In the 2nd example <lb/>
            from the Iliad, ov ought not to be read " spiritu aspero," and with a cir­ <lb/>
            cumflex accent, so as to signify " where;" but with a grave accent and <lb/>
            " spiritu leni," so as to signify " not," Hippias Thasius thus defends <lb/>
            Homer in the Poetics. In the first example, at Iliad xxi. 297, there is <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίδομεν δέ τοι, κ</foreign>. T. \.; but the line, as here given, and in the Poetics, <lb/>
            does not occur in Homer. See Ritter. Taylor observes, " It is from the <lb/>
            second book of the Iliad, where Jupiter orders a dream to deceive Aga­ <lb/>
            memnon, and, as some read, Jupiter is made to say, that he will give <lb/>
            glory to Agamemnon, and therefore they represent Jupiter as lying, but the <lb/>
            fallacy arises from accent; we ought not to read <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίδομεν</foreign> with an accent <lb/>
            on the antepen., so that it may signify "damus;" but <foreign xml:lang="grc">διδόμεν</foreign>, with an <lb/>
            accent on the penult., so that it may be an infinitive Ionic, and signify <lb/>

            are when it is required to be granted, that any <lb/>
            thing is similarly present with a subject and acci­ <lb/>

          <p>Other (paralogisms arise) from some particular <lb/>
            thing being said to be simply this, or in a certain <lb/>
            respect, and not properly, when what is predicated <lb/>
            in part, is assumed as spoken simply; e. g. if <lb/>
            (some one should infer that if) what is not, is <lb/>
            the object of opinion, what is not, is, for it is not <lb/>

            thing being <lb/>
            simply, or in a <lb/>
            certain respect, <lb/>
            stated. Vide <lb/>
            Whately, iii. <lb/>
            12; Aldrich, <lb/>
            Mansel's App. <lb/>
            Hill, 320. <lb/>
            simply.1 Or, again, that being is not being, if some one of <lb/>
            the number of beings is not, for instance if man is not, for it <lb/>
            is not the same for a certain thing not to be, and not to be <lb/>
            simply, but there seems from the affinity of diction, to be but <lb/>
            a small difference between a certain thing existing and exist­ <lb/>
            ence, and a certain thing not existing and non-existence. <lb/>
            Likewise, also, (paralogisms arise) from (predication) in a cer­ <lb/>
            tain respect, and simply, thus, if an Indian, being wholly black, <lb/>
            has white teeth, he is white and not white, or if both are <lb/>
            present in a certain respect, that contraries are present at the <lb/>
            same time. Such a case, however, (of paralogism) it is easy <lb/>
            for every body to perceive in certain (sentences), for in­ <lb/>
            stance, if assuming the Ethiopian to be black, he should ask <lb/>
            whether he is white as to his teeth,* if then in <lb/>
            this respect he is white, it may be thought syllo­ <lb/>
            gistically proved, when he has perfected the in­ <lb/>
            terrogation, that (the man) is black and not black. <lb/>

            In some sentences, indeed, (the paralogism) is frequently <lb/>
            latent, viz. in those, where when an assertion is made in a <lb/>
            certain respect, the simply (being asserted) also seems to <lb/>
            follow, and in those wherein it is not easy to perceive, whethe' <note type="footnote"> taken simply, to the same term modified by any adjunct; which sophism <lb/>
            is called " fallacia accidentis," because it applies to the accident, what is <lb/>
            true of the subject, only. For examples, see Hill's Logic; that given by <lb/>
            Arist. in the text may be thus stated, <lb/>
            Coriscus is different from Socrates, <lb/>
            Socrates is a man, <lb/>
            ∴ Coriscus is different from a man: and the fallacy consists in <lb/>
            assuming, that whatever is different from a given subject is incompatible <lb/>
            with all the predicates (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ ϭυμβαίνοντα</foreign>) of the subject. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 This, as Whately states, is the converse to the last fallacy : it involves <lb/>
            four terms, as in the example stated by Aristotle, which will be thus, <lb/>

            wherein opposites are similarly inherent, for it seems that <lb/>
            either both, or neither, must be granted as simply predicated ; <lb/>
            e. g. if one half (of a thing) is white, but the other black, <lb/>

          <p>Others (arise) from its not being defined what <lb/>
            a syllogism is, or what an elenchus,1 but the de­ <lb/>

            tion of one and the same, not of a name but of a <lb/>
            thing, and of a name not synonymous, but the <lb/>
            same collected necessarily from the things <lb/>
            granted, the original (question) not being co-enumerated ac­ <lb/>
            cording to the same, with reference to the same in a similar <lb/>
            manner, and in the same time. In the same way also, falsity <lb/>
            about any thing (occurs); some, however, omitting some one <lb/>
            of these, appear to employ an elenchus, as that the double and <lb/>
            the non-double are the same, for two are the double of one, <lb/>
            but not the double of three; or if the same thing is the <lb/>
            double and not the double of the same, yet not according to <lb/>
            the same, for according to length it is double, but according <lb/>
            to breadth it is not double: or if it is (the double) of the <lb/>
            same thing, and according to the same, and in a similar <lb/>

          <p>Those which are from petitio principii, arise <lb/>
            thus, and in as many ways as it is possible to beg <lb/>
            the original question ; they seem, however, to con­ <lb/>

          <p>The elenchus on account of the consequent, is <lb/>
            from fancying that the consequence reciprocates. <lb/>
            For when from the existence of that thing, this <lb/>
            necessarily is, they fancy that if this is, the other <lb/>
            necessarily is, whence also deceptions from sense <note type="footnote"> I In its strict sense, Ignoratio Elenchi denotes the unintentional use of <lb/>

            because a yellow colour is consequent to honey,1 and since it <lb/>
            happens, that the earth when it has rained becomes moist, if <lb/>
            it be moist, we think that it has rained, yet this is not neces­ <lb/>
            sary. In rhetorical (arguments), the demonstrations which <lb/>
            are derived from a sign are from consequent, for when persons <lb/>
            desire to show that a man is an adulterer, they assume a <lb/>
            consequent, that he is fond of adorning his person, or that he <lb/>
            is seen wandering by night, these things, however, are pre­ <lb/>
            sent with many men, but the thing predicated is not present. <lb/>
            Likewise, also, in syllogistic (arguments), for instance, the <lb/>
            argument of Melissus, that the universe is infinite, assuming <lb/>
            the universe to be unbegotten, (for nothing can be generated <lb/>
            from what is not, but what is generated is gener­ <lb/>
            ated from a beginning ;* if, therefore, the universe <lb/>
            was not generated, it had not a beginning, so that <lb/>
            * Cf. Phys. <lb/>
            Ausc. i. 3, 2. <lb/>
            it is infinite. Nevertheless, this does not necessarily happen, for <lb/>
            it does not follow, that if whatever is generated has a begin­ <lb/>
            ning, whatever has a beginning is also generated, as neither is <lb/>
            it necessary, if a man in a fever is hot, that whoever is hot <lb/>

          <p>That which is from what is not a cause, being <lb/>

            taken, as if the elenchus were produced on account <lb/>
            of it.2 Now such a thing happens in syllogisms <lb/>
            leading to the impossible, since in these it is <lb/>
            necessary to subvert some one of the posita; if <lb/>

              some one should not say that life is the same as soul, but <lb/>
              only that life is contrary to death, which is corruption, and <lb/>

              simply unsyllogistic, but unsyllogistic as to the thing proposed, <lb/>

            fallac.</p>
          <p>Such, then, are the arguments which result <lb/>
            from what is consequent, and from what is not a <lb/>
            cause, but others from making two interrogations <lb/>
            one, when it escapes notice that there are many, <lb/>
            and one answer is given as if there were one (inter­ <lb/>
            rogation ).1 In some cases, therefore, it is easy to <lb/>
            perceive that there are many (interrogations), and <lb/>
            that one answer must not be given, as, whether is the earth <lb/>
            sea, or the heaven ? in others it is less (easy), and as if there <lb/>
            were one interrogation, men either assent, because they do <lb/>
            not answer what is asked, or seem to be confuted, as, whether <lb/>
            is this person, and this, a man ? so that if some one should <lb/>
            beat this, and that person, he will beat a man, and not men. <lb/>
            Or again, in those things of which some are good, but others <lb/>
            not good, are all good or not good ? for whatever a man <lb/>
            replies, it is possible to appear either to assert an elenchus <lb/>
            or what is apparently false; for to say that some one of the <lb/>
            things not good is good, or that some one of the things good <lb/>
            is not good, is a falsehood. Still, sometimes, there may be a <lb/>
            true elenchus from certain assumptions, for instance, if a man <lb/>
            should grant that things white, naked, and blind, are simi­ <lb/>
            larly called one and many, for if that is blind which has not <lb/>
            sight, but is adapted to have it by nature, those also will be <lb/>
            blind which have not sight, but are naturally adapted to have <lb/>
            it; when therefore, one thing has it, but another has not, both <lb/>
            will see or will be blind, which is impossible. <note type="footnote"> 1 Whately observes that the " Fallacia plurium interrogationum," or, <lb/>
            as it may be named simply, the fallacy of interrogation, should be referred <lb/>
            to the head of ambiguous middle; it consists in putting two questions as <lb/>
            one, and hence insnaring the opponent by an answer partly false. </note></p><pb n="553"/>

          <p>WE must either, therefore, thus divide apparent <lb/>
            syllogisms and elenchi, or refer them all to ignor­ <lb/>
            ance of the elenchus, assuming this as a principle, <lb/>
            for it is possible to resolve all the modes men­ <lb/>
            tioned into the definition of the elenchus.1 In <lb/>
            the first place, if they are unsyllogistic, for the <lb/>
            1. All decep­ <lb/>
            tions may be <lb/>
            referred to ig­ <lb/>

            I Those in <lb/>
            diction. <lb/>
            conclusion must result from the posita, so that we may say it <lb/>
            is of necessity, and not that it appears to be. Next, as to the <lb/>
            parts of definition, for of those (paralogisms) which are in <lb/>
            diction, some are from two-fold signification, for instance, <lb/>
            equivocation, and a sentence (ambiguous) and a similar figure <lb/>
            (of speech), (for it is usual with all these to signify this parti­ <lb/>
            cular thing,) but composition, and division, and accent, (pro­ <lb/>
            duce false reasoning,) from the sentence not being the same, <lb/>
            or the name being different. But it is necessary that this <lb/>
            should be the same as the thing is so, if there is to be an <lb/>
            elenchus or syllogism; thus, if a garment (is to be concluded), <lb/>
            a garment, and not a vestment, ought to be syllogistically con­ <lb/>
            cluded : for that is true, indeed, but is not syllogistically <lb/>
            inferred, as there is still need of interrogation, that it signifies <lb/>
            the same thing by him who investigates the why.</p>
          <p>Paralogisms from accident, become evident <lb/>
            when the syllogism is defined, for it is necessary <lb/>
            that there be the same definition of the elenchus, <lb/>
            except that contradiction is added, for the elen- <lb/>
            2. And those <lb/>

            nem," as. 1. <lb/>
            from accident. <lb/>
            chug is a syllogism of contradiction. If then there is not a <lb/>
            syllogism of accident, there is not an elenchus, for neither if <lb/>
            when these things exist it is necessary that this should be, (but <lb/>
            this is white,) is it necessary to be white on account of the <lb/>
            syllogism, nor if a triangle has angles equal to two right, but it <lb/>
            happens to it to be a figure, either first or the principle, (does <lb/>
            it follow) that figure, or principle, or first, is this thing. For <lb/>
            the demonstration is not so far as it is figure, nor so far as it is <lb/>
            first, but so far as it is triangle, and similarly in other cases. <note type="footnote"> 1 If any condition required for proving the contradictory of a proposi­ <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[CHAP. VI."/>Wherefore, if an elenchus is a certain syllogism, that which is <lb/>
            from accident will not be an elenchus, but by this, artists, and <lb/>
            the scientific generally, are confuted by the unscientific, for <lb/>
            they form syllogisms from accident, against scientific men, but <lb/>
            they, not being able to distinguish, either grant when ques­ <lb/>

          <p>Those which belong to " in a certain respect,' <lb/>
            and "simply," (arise) because the affirmation and <lb/>
            negation are not of the same thing, for of what is <lb/>
            in a certain respect, white, the negation is, that which in a <lb/>
            certain respect, is not white, but of what is simply, white, that <lb/>
            which is simply, not white. If then, when it is granted that a <lb/>
            thing is in a certain respect white, a person assumes it as if <lb/>
            said, simply white, he does not produce an elenchus, but he <lb/>
            seems to do so, from ignorance of what an elenchus is.</p>

            definition</p>
          <p>The most evident of all, are those which were <lb/>
            before mentioned, from the definition of an elen­ <lb/>

            as an appearance (of elenchus) is produced from the ellipse of <lb/>
            definition, and by those who thus divide, the defect of defini­ <lb/>

          <p>4. Petitio prin­ <lb/>

          <p>Those also which are from petitio principle and <lb/>
            from admitting “ non-causa,” "pro causa" become <lb/>
            manifest bv definition, for it is necessary that the <lb/>
            conclusion should happen in consequence of these things ex­ <lb/>

            to have been generated, and to have a beginning, <lb/>
            * Buhle and <lb/>
            Taylor insert <lb/>
            " whiteness." <lb/>
            t Vide Phys. <lb/>
            Ausc. i. 3, 2. <lb/>
            are the same ; or that to become equals, is identical with to re­ <lb/>
            ceive the same magnitude ; for because what was generated <lb/>
            has a beginning, they require it to be granted, that what had <lb/>
            a beginning, was generated, as if both these were the same from <lb/>
            having a beginning, viz. that which was generated, and what <lb/>
            was finite. Likewise, also in things made equal, if those <lb/>
            which receive one, and the same magnitude, become equal, <lb/>
            those also which become equal, receive one magnitude, so that <lb/>
            the consequent is assumed. Since then, an elenchus which <lb/>
            is from accident, subsists in the ignorance of the elenchus, it <lb/>
            is clear that this also is the case, with that which is from the <lb/>
            consequent, and this is also to be considered in another way.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding, those paralogisms which are <lb/>
            from making many interrogations, one, consist in <lb/>
            our not distinctly unfolding the definition, of the <lb/>
            6. Those from <lb/>
            making many <lb/>
            questions one. <lb/>
            proposition. For the proposition is one thing of one, since <lb/>
            there is the same definition of a thing, one only and simply, as <lb/>
            of man, and of one man only, and similarly in other cases. If <lb/>
            then, one proposition be that which requires one thing of one, <lb/>
            an interrogation of this kind will be simply a proposition, but <lb/>
            since a syllogism is from propositions, and the elenchus is a <lb/>
            syllogism, an elenchus also will consist of propositions, where­ <lb/>
            fore if a proposition be one thing of one, it is evident that <lb/>
            he (who errs) in the definition of syllogism, is in ignorance of <lb/>
            an elenchus, as that seems a proposition, which is not one. <lb/>
            If then he gives an answer, as if to one interrogation, it will <lb/>
            be an elenchus, but if he does not, yet seems to do so, it will <lb/>
            be an apparent elenchus, so that all the places fall into ignor­ <lb/>
            ance of the elenchus, those from diction, because there is ap­ <lb/>
            parent contradiction, which was the characteristic of an elen­ <lb/>
            chus, but the rest from the definition of syllogism. <note type="footnote"> 1 Because an elenchus being defined, a syllogism of contradiction, this <lb/>

          <p>DECEPTION of these (paralogisms) from equivoca­ <lb/>
            tion and (ambiguous) sentence, arises from our <lb/>
            not being able to distinguish that which is multi­ <lb/>
            fariously predicated, (since it is not easy to divide <lb/>
            some things, for instance, the one, being, and the <lb/>
            same ;*) but of those from composition and divi­ <lb/>
            sion, in consequence of fancying there is no dif­ <lb/>
            ference between a conjoined, and a divided sentence, as is the <lb/>
            case in most things. Similarly also with regard to those from <lb/>
            accent, for either in nothing, or not in many things, a sentence <lb/>
            with intention, and a sentence with remission, appear to sig­ <lb/>
            nify the same thing.1 But of those from figure of speech, it is <lb/>
            on account of the similarity of diction, for it is difficult to dis­ <lb/>
            tinguish what things are predicated after the same, and what <lb/>
            in a different manner, (since he who is able to do this, almost <lb/>
            approaches the perception of truth, and especially knows how <lb/>
            to assent,) because we suppose that every thing predicated of <lb/>
            a certain thing, is this definite thing, and we admit it as one; <lb/>
            for this particular definite thing, and being, seem especially to <lb/>
            be consequent to the one, and to essence. Wherefore this <lb/>
            mode is to be placed amongst those (fallacies) which belong <lb/>
            to diction ; first, because deception rather arises to those who <lb/>
            consider with others, than by themselves, (for consideration <lb/>
            with others, is through discourse, but that by oneself, is no <lb/>
            less through the thing itself;) next, it happens that one is de­ <lb/>
            ceived by oneself, when one makes the consideration by <lb/>
            words; moreover, deception is from resemblance, but resem­ <lb/>
            blance from diction. Of the paralogisms from accident, (there <lb/>
            is deception) from our inability to distinguish the same, and <note type="footnote"> I Vide Waitz, vol. ii. p. 541. We are deceived, 1st, By ambiguity and <lb/>
            equivocation, from not knowing the distinction of a multifariously pre­ <lb/>

            erroneously supposing it immaterial whether certain terms be united or <lb/>
            separate; 3rd, By accent, because as sometimes when changed, accent does <lb/>
            not affect the sense, so when the sense is changed, we take it as the same. <lb/>
            4th, By figure of speech, because when words have the same figure, we <lb/>
            erroneously take them in the same way. 5th, By accident triply, from <lb/>
            not distinguishing between the " same " and the " different;" between <lb/>
            " one " and " many;" from ignorance as to all things which are said of <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. VIII.]"/>different, and one, and many, and to what attributes, anJ thing, <lb/>
            all these are accidental. Likewise also, as to those from what <lb/>
            is consequent, for the consequent is a certain part of accident; <lb/>
            besides also, in many instances it appears, and is required to <lb/>
            be granted thus, that if this thing is not separated from that, <lb/>
            neither will that, be separated from this. Nevertheless, of those <lb/>
            which are from the defect of definition, and of those from a <lb/>
            certain respect, and simply, there is deception from the dif­ <lb/>
            ference being small, for we concede universally, as if a cer­ <lb/>
            tain thing, or in a certain respect, or in what manner, or now, <lb/>
            signified nothing in addition. Likewise also, in the case of <lb/>
            those which assume the original question, and which are not <lb/>
            causes, and such as make many interrogations as if they <lb/>
            were one, since in all these, the deception arises from small­ <lb/>
            ness, as we do not accurately distinguish either the definition <lb/>
            of the proposition, or of the syllogism, on account of the <lb/>
            before-named cause.</p>

            the syllogism and elenchus which are apparent elenchus. <lb/>
            but not real, but also the real, but which appear (falsely) <lb/>
            appropriate to a thing. Such are they which do not confute <lb/>
            according to a thing, and expose the ignorant, which was the <lb/>
            province of the peirastic art, but the peirastic is a part of the <lb/>

            Sophistical elenchi, on the other hand, though they syllogisti­ <lb/>

          <p>Now that we obtain these. by the same method <lb/>
            is evident, for from those things, through which <lb/>
            it appears to the hearers, that the subjects of in­ <lb/>
            vestigation are syllogistically concluded, from these <lb/>
            they may appear also to the respondent, so that <lb/>
            there will be false syllogisms through either all or some of <lb/>
            these, for what a person, not interrogated, thinks he has <lb/>
            granted, he will also admit when interrogated, except that in <lb/>
            some cases it happens at the same time that what is deficient <lb/>
            is questioned, and what is false is detected, as in the paralo­ <lb/>
            gisms from diction and solecism. If then, paralogisms of <lb/>
            contradiction arise from apparent elenchus, it is clear that <lb/>
            false syllogisms will be derived from as many (places) as ap­ <lb/>
            parent elenchus. But the apparent is from parts of the true ; <lb/>
            for when each fails, there may appear an elenchus, as that <lb/>
            which is from the conclusion not happening in consequence <lb/>
            of the reasoning; that which leads to the impossible; also, <lb/>
            that which makes two interrogations, one, from the proposi­ <lb/>

            which is (derived) from what is consequent; <lb/>
            besides not to happen in the thing, but in the discussion ; <lb/>
            then, instead of (assuming) contradiction universally, ac­ <lb/>
            cording to the same, and with reference to the same, and after <lb/>

          <p>A sophistical elenchus, is yet not simply an <lb/>
            elenchus, but against some person, and a syllo­ <lb/>
            gism likewise, for except it be assumed that what <lb/>
            is from the equivocal signifies one thing, and what is from <lb/>
            a similar figure of speech, (signifies) this thing only, and the <lb/>
            rest in like manner, there will neither be elenchi nor syllo­ <lb/>
            gisms, whether simply, or against him who is interrogated, <lb/>
            but if this is assumed, there will be, indeed, against him who <lb/>
            § i. e. the re­ <lb/>

            is interrogated, but simply there will not be, since <lb/>

          <p>NEVERTHELESS, we should not endeavour to <lb/>
            assume from how many places they are confuted, <lb/>
            who are confuted by elenchi, without the science <lb/>
            of all things, which, however, belongs to no one <lb/>
            art, since there are perhaps infinite sciences, so that <lb/>
            evidently there are also infinite demonstrations.1 <lb/>
            Still there are also true elenchi, for in whatever it <lb/>
            1. Why we <lb/>
            must not as­ <lb/>
            sume from how <lb/>
            many places <lb/>
            confutation by <lb/>
            elenchus oc­ <lb/>
            curs, without <lb/>
            universal <lb/>
            science. <lb/>
            is possible to demonstrate, we may also therein confute him <lb/>
            who lays down a contradiction of the truth, as if he asserted <lb/>
            the diameter of a square to be commensurate with its side, a <lb/>
            person might confute him by showing it incommensurate. <lb/>
            Wherefore, it will be necessary to be scientifically cognizant <lb/>
            of all, for some (elenchi) will be from geometrical principles, <lb/>
            and their conclusions ; others from medical principles ; others <lb/>
            from those of other sciences; moreover, false elenchi are <lb/>
            similarly amongst infinites, since according to each art there <lb/>
            is a false syllogism, as the geometrical in geometry, and the <lb/>
            medical, (false syllogism) in medicine. Now I mean by ac­ <lb/>
            cording to art, that which is according to the principles of <lb/>
            that art, therefore it is evident that places are not to be as­ <lb/>
            sumed of all elenchi, but of those which belong to dialectic, <lb/>
            since these are common to every art and faculty. <lb/>
            It is also, indeed, the province of the man of <lb/>
            science to investigate the elenchus which is in <lb/>
            2. Duty of the <lb/>
            scientific man. <lb/>
            each science, whether it is only apparent, not real, and if it is, <lb/>
            why it is; but that (elenchus) which is from things common, <lb/>
            and does not fall under any art, belongs to dialectics. For if <lb/>
            we have those particulars from which probable syllogisms <note type="footnote"> I In examining the force and accuracy of an argument, the first step <lb/>
            is to acquire a clear and definite understanding of the question to be <lb/>
            proved, and laying aside all extraneous matter, to express that question <lb/>
            as simply as possible. If then, we wish to ascertain the elements of all <lb/>
            refutation, we must evidently be cognizant in a perfect manner, (not <lb/>
            allowed to humanity,) of all truth; also as there may be an infinite num­ <lb/>
            ber of true, so there may be of false refutations, thence Aristotle does not <lb/>
            here treat of every false or sophistical confutation, but only of the false <lb/>
            dialectic confutation which is common to all arts, since as dialectic shows <lb/>
            how to effect demonstration from probable propositions, it will also show, <lb/>
            how to effect confutation when the same probabilities are employed. </note> <pb n="560"/>

            bable) elenchi are formed, since the elenchus is a syllogism of <lb/>
            contradiction, so that an elenchus is either one or two syllo­ <lb/>
            gisms of contradiction, therefore we have the number of places <lb/>
            from which all such originate, and if we have this, we also <lb/>
            possess their solutions, for objections of these are solutions. <lb/>
            We have, however, the places from which apparent elenchi <lb/>
            arise, not apparent to every one, but to certain persons, for <lb/>

          <p>In short, it is absurd to discuss an elenchus,1 <lb/>

            do mathematical arguments pertain to the reason <lb/>
            or not ? and if a triangle seems to some one to <lb/>

            does not understand, nor fancy (that it does), how <lb/>
            does this disputation not pertain to the reason? <lb/>
            or how must we interrogate, unless by granting a <lb/>
            distinction,2 whether any one may inquire if it is possible for <lb/>
            him who is silent to speak or not, or whether it partly is not, <lb/>
            and partly is, possible ? If then, some one should grant that it <lb/>
            is by no means possible, but another should contend that it is, <lb/>
            will not the disputation be against the reasoning faculty ? <lb/>
            though the dispute seems to belong to those which are from <lb/>
            name; there is not then a certain genus of arguments, which <lb/>
            belong to the reason. Nevertheless, some pertain to name, <lb/>
            yet not all are such, not (I say) those which are elenchi, but <lb/>
            not the apparent elenchi, for there are apparent elenchi, which <lb/>

            a division, I mean that the silent speaks, partly <lb/>
            in this and partly in that manner; yet to demand <lb/>

            conquest entirely the object of their preference, <lb/>
            try all things, and here, the contentious do. Those <lb/>
            therefore who are such, for the sake of victory it­ <lb/>

            Those who love strife also, and sophists, employ the same <lb/>
            arguments, yet not for the sake of the same things, and the <lb/>
            same argument will be both sophistical and contentious, yet <lb/>
            not according to the same, but so far as it is for the sake ot <lb/>

            false describer is to the geometrician, for (the one) <lb/>
            paralogizes from the same things with dialectic, and the false <lb/>
            describer (subsists in the same way with regard to) the geo­ <lb/>
            metrician. Still he is not contentious, because he describes <lb/>
            falsely from principles and conclusions which are subject to <lb/>
            art, but it will be evident that he who is subject to dialectic, is <lb/>
            about other things contentious, as the quadrature of the circle <lb/>
            through lunulae is not contentious, but (the quadrature) of Bryso <note type="footnote"> 601, and Buhle, vol. ii. p. 687. Alexander, (Schol. 307, a. 15,) for Hippo­ <lb/>

            scription does to the geometrician, there would not be a con­ <lb/>
            tentious syllogism about those; now however the dialectician <lb/>
            is not in any definite genus, nor does he demonstrate any <lb/>
            thing, nor is he such as the universal (philoso­ <lb/>

            demonstrate a certain nature is interrogative, for it is not <lb/>
            possible to grant each of the parts, || tor a syllo­ <lb/>
            gism does not arise from both. Dialectic how­ <lb/>

            though not all things, yet it would not interrogate <lb/>
            || Of contradic­ <lb/>
            tion. <lb/>
            4. Dialectic is <lb/>
            interrogative. <lb/>
            primary things and proper principles ; for there being no <lb/>
            concession,¶ he would no longer have arguments <lb/>
            from which he could discourse against the objec­ <lb/>

            tine man may possess it, since it is possible that he who is <lb/>
            ignorant of a thing may make trial of one who is ignorant, <lb/>
            if he concedes not from what he knows, nor from properties, <lb/>
            but from consequents, which are such as there is nothing to <lb/>
            prevent him who knows them, not knowing the art, but it is <lb/>
            necessary that he who does not know them, must be ignorant <lb/>
            (of the art). Wherefore, it is evident that the peirastic art <lb/>
            is the science of nothing definite; hence also, it is conversant <lb/>
            with all things, since all arts use certain common things, on <note type="footnote"> 1 That nothing can be moved. Vide Physics, b. vi. Aristotle observes <lb/>

            men therefore confute, for without art they partake of this <lb/>
            with which dialectic is artistically conversant, and he is a dia­ <lb/>
            lectician who is peirastic in the syllogistic art. Nevertheless, <lb/>
            since these are many, and are about all things, yet are not of <lb/>
            such a kind as to be in a certain nature and genus, but as <lb/>
            negations, other things again are not such, but are properties, <lb/>
            it is possible from these to make a trial about all, and that <lb/>
            there should be a certain art, and that it should not be such <lb/>

            as those are which demonstrate. W heretore, the <lb/>
            contentious person is not one who in all respects <lb/>
            thus subsists, as the maker of a false description, <lb/>
            for the contentious person will not be paralogistic <lb/>
            from a certain definite genus of principles, but will be about <lb/>
            every genus.1</p>
          <p>Such then are the modes of sophistical elenchi, but it is not <lb/>
            difficult to perceive that it is the province of the dialectician to <lb/>
            investigate these, and to be able to effect them, for the method <lb/>

            ject of sophistical preference,) in the first place, this generally <lb/>
            happens from a certain manner of inquiry, and through in­ <lb/>
            terrogation. For to make an interrogation to <lb/>
            nothing definitely laid down, is adapted to the in­ <lb/>
            vestigation of these things ; since those who speak <lb/>
            casually commit a greater fault, and they speak <lb/>
            casually who have nothing proposed. Both to <lb/>

            against which a discussion is made, and to require <lb/>
            a person - to assert what appears,t produces a <lb/>
            certain abundance of argument, so as to lead to <lb/>
            1. To interro­ <lb/>
            gate nothing <lb/>
            definitely laid <lb/>

            him to those particulars against which an abundance of argu­ <lb/>
            ment is supplied. They are able however, to in­ <lb/>
            jure by these means, less now, than formerly, for <lb/>
            they ask what this has to do with the original <lb/>

            vention of <lb/>
            these. <lb/>
            proposition; still the element of obtaining something false or <lb/>
            contrary to opinion, is to question no thesis im­ <lb/>
            mediately, but to assert that the question is made <lb/>
            from the desire of learning; for this consideration <lb/>
            makes a place for argument. <lb/>
            4. To assert the <lb/>
            question is <lb/>
            made for the <lb/>
            sake of learn­ <lb/>
            ing.</p>
          <p>In order to show a false assertion, a proper <lb/>
            sophistical place is to bring (the opponent) to <lb/>
            those things against which there is an abundance <lb/>
            of arguments; but we may do this both well and <lb/>
            badly, as was observed before.</p>
          <p>5. To induce <lb/>
            the opponent to <lb/>
            the arguer's <lb/>
            strong points. <lb/>
            Cf. Top. ii. 5.</p>
          <p>Again, to state paradoxes, observe from what <lb/>
            genus ‡ the disputant is, then ask what that is <lb/>
            which such men assert to be contrary to the com­ <lb/>
            mon opinion, for to each (sect) there is something <lb/>
            of this kind. The element however of these is <lb/>
            to assume the thesis of the several (sects) in the <lb/>
            t Of philoso­ <lb/>
            phers. <lb/>

            what the philo­ <lb/>
            sophers of the <lb/>
            opponent's or­ <lb/>
            der—assert <lb/>
            paradoxical. <lb/>
            propositions, but an appropriate solution of these, is adduced <lb/>
            to show that what is contrary to opinion does not happen <lb/>
            through the argument, and this is always the wish of him <lb/>
            who contends.</p>
          <p>Moreover, from volitions and apparent opi- 7. From voli­ <pb n="568"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[CHAP. XII."/>tions and appa­ <lb/>
            rent opinions. <lb/>
            * Arguments <lb/>
            must be de­ <lb/>
            rived. <lb/>
            nions,*1 since they do not desire and say the <lb/>
            same thing, but employ the most seemly words, <lb/>
            and desire things which appear profitable ; for in­ <lb/>
            stance, they say, it is necessary to die well, rather <lb/>
            than to live pleasantly, and to be justly poor, than to be basely <lb/>
            rich ; but they desire the contrary. He therefore who speaks <lb/>
            according to volitions, must be brought to apparent opinions, <lb/>
            but he who speaks according to these, must be brought to <lb/>
            concealed (volitions), for it is necessary in both ways to speak <lb/>
            paradoxes, since either they assert what is contrary to appa­ <lb/>
            rent or to unapparent opinions.</p>
          <p>8. The place <lb/>
            for inducing <lb/>
            paradox, very <lb/>
            extensive.</p>
          <p>The place indeed of causing the assertion of <lb/>
            paradoxes is very extensive, as Callicles in the <lb/>
            Gorgias is introduced, saying, (which also all the <lb/>
            ancients consider to happen,) from what was ac­ <lb/>
            cording to nature, and according to law; for they say nature, <lb/>
            and law, are contraries, and that justice according to law, is <lb/>
            excellent, but according to nature, it is not excellent. Where­ <lb/>
            fore we must oppose him according to law who speaks accord­ <lb/>
            ing to nature, but lead him to nature who speaks according <lb/>
            to law, for to say that it exists in either of these two ways, is <lb/>
            paradoxical. But according to them, that which is after nature <lb/>
            is true, but what is according to law is that which appears to <lb/>
            the multitude ; wherefore it is evident that they, as the dis­ <lb/>
            putants, now endeavoured either to confute the respondent, or <lb/>
            to make him assert paradoxes.</p>
          <p>9. That some <lb/>
            questions have <lb/>
            answers either <lb/>
            way paradoxi­ <lb/>
            cal.</p>
          <p>Some questions, indeed, have on both sides an <lb/>
            answer contrary to opinion, as whether is it right <lb/>
            to obey the wise or a father, and ought we to do <lb/>
            things advantageous or just, and is to be iniured <lb/>
            more eligible than to injure ? We ought, however, to lead to <lb/>
            conclusions which are opposed to the multitude and the wise, <lb/>
            if, indeed, some one speaks as those who are conversant with <lb/>
            disputations, we ought to bring him to conclusions contrary to <lb/>
            the multitude; but if he speaks as the multitude, (to conclu­ <lb/>
            sions contrary) to those who are conversant with disputations. <lb/>
            t The wise. <lb/>
            For the one, indeed, say that the happy man is <lb/>
            necessarily just, but it seems contrary to the <lb/>
            opinion of the many, that a king should not be happy; thus to <note type="footnote">1 Cf. Waitz in loc. </note> <pb n="569"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. XIII.]"/>collect things contrary to opinion, is the same with leading to <lb/>
            what is contrary to nature and law, for law is the opinion of <lb/>
            the many, but the wise speak after nature and after truth.1</p>

          <p>PARADOXES, indeed, we must investigate from <lb/>
            these places, but with regard to making a man <lb/>

            is stated, but the double and the double and the half are the <lb/>
            same, if then, the double is the double of the half, it will be <lb/>
            the double of the half of the half.3 Again, also, if instead of <lb/>
            double, we lay down the double of the half, it will be thrice <lb/>
            said, the double of the half of the half of the half. And is <lb/>
            desire then the desire of the pleasant ? but this is the appetite <lb/>

            of the pleasant.</p>

            also the things themselves are predicated with <lb/>
            reference to something, and are referred to one <lb/>
            and the same thing; thus appetite is the appetite of some­ <lb/>

          <p>SOLECISM is what we have declared before; some­ <lb/>
            times, however, it is possible to produce this, and <lb/>
            not producing to seem to do so, and producing it, <lb/>
            not to appear to, as Protagoras said, if <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴνις</foreign> ‡. and <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πήληξ</foreign>,§ are of the masculine gender: for he who <lb/>
            says <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐλόμενην</foreign>, commits a solecism according to <lb/>
            him, but to others does not seem to, but he who says <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀυλόμενον</foreign>, <lb/>
            seems to solecize but does not.1 Hence it is clear that a cer­ <lb/>
            tain art can produce this ; wherefore many arguments which <lb/>
            do not infer a solecism, seem to infer it as in the elenchi.</p>
          <p>2. Whence</p>
          <p>Almost all apparent solecisms, indeed, are from <note type="footnote"> I If it is said <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴνις όυλόμενη</foreign> it is solecism, because <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴνις</foreign> is masculine, <lb/>
            but it does not seem so, and if it is said <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴνις ὀυλόμενος</foreign>, it seems a <lb/>
            solecism, yet is not. We may remark that the word (taken from the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Σόλοικοι</foreign>, a people in Cilicia notorious for their corruption of the Greek <lb/>
            language) is applied to impropriety of behaviour, as of expression. Cf. <lb/>
            Rhet. b. ii. ch. 16 : Massinker's Unnatural Combat, act iii. sc. 1; Ben <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. XIV.]"/>hoc, and when the case signifies neither male nor <lb/>
            female, but what is between,1 for hie signifies the <lb/>
            apparent <unclear>solo­</unclear> <lb/>
            cisms arise. <lb/>
            masculine, hæc the feminine, and hoc, indeed, ought to signify <lb/>
            what is between, but frequently signifies either of these, as, for <lb/>
            instance ; “ What is this ? " " Calliope," " wood," <lb/>
            " Coriscus." 2 All * the cases then of the masculine <lb/>
            * Quid est hoc t <lb/>
            and feminine diner, but of what is between, some do, and others <lb/>
            do not ;3 frequently, therefore, when " hoc" is given, they syllo­ <lb/>
            gize as if “hunc” were said, and in like manner take one case <lb/>
            for another. Now a paralogism is produced, because “ hoc" is <lb/>
            common to many cases, for “ hoc" at one time signifies “hic,” <lb/>
            and at another time “hunc;” it is requisite, however, that it <lb/>
            should signify alternately with the verb " est," " hic," but with <lb/>
            "esse," "hunc," for instance, lest Coriscus," "esse Coriscum." <lb/>
            Also in like manner with feminine nouns, and with those which <lb/>
            are called <foreign xml:lang="grc">σκεύη</foreign>, (furniture,) but which have a feminine or mas­ <lb/>
            culine inflection, for whatever end in o and y, have alone the <lb/>
            inflection of <foreign xml:lang="grc">σκεύη</foreign>,4 as <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξύλον</foreign>, wood, <foreign xml:lang="grc">σχοινίον</foreign>, a rope, but those <lb/>
            which are not thus, (have the inflexion) of the masculine or femi­ <lb/>
            nine, some of which we refer to <foreign xml:lang="grc">σκεύη</foreign>, as <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀσκὸς</foreign>, a bladder, is a <lb/>
            masculine noun, but <foreign xml:lang="grc">κλίνη</foreign>, a bed, is feminine; wherefore, like­ <lb/>
            wise, in such things also, "est" and “esse” will produce a dif­ <lb/>
            ference. In a certain respect too, a solecism is <lb/>
            similar to those so called elenchi, from things not <lb/>
            similar being similarly assumed,5 for as in them <lb/>
            in things, so in these a solecism is committed in <lb/>
            3. That a sole­ <lb/>
            cism resembles <lb/>
            an elenchus so <lb/>
            called. Cf. <lb/>
            ch. 4. <lb/>
            words, for "man" and "white" are both things and words.</p>
          <p>It is evident, then, that we must endeavour to infer a sole­ <lb/>

          <p>ONE thing which contributes to confutation by <lb/>
            an elenchus is prolixity,* for it is difficult to con­ <lb/>
            sider many things at once, and for prolixity we <lb/>
            must employ the above-named elements. Another <lb/>
            thing is rapidity, for those who are slow, perceive <lb/>
            less; anger also, and contention, for all men who <lb/>
            are disturbed, have less power of observation.1 <lb/>
            The elements, however, of anger, are for a man <lb/>
            to render himself obviously willing to commit <lb/>
            injustice, and to conduct himself with thorough im­ <lb/>
            pudence. Moreover to arrange the questions <lb/>
            alternately, whether a man has many arguments <lb/>
            for the same thing, or (to show) that they sub­ <lb/>
            sist in one way, and not in another, for at the <lb/>
            same time it happens that (the opponent will guard against <lb/>
            many things or such as are contrary. In short, all the things <lb/>
            enumerated before as contributing to concealment, are useful <lb/>
            also for contentious arguments; for concealment is for the <lb/>
            sake of escaping notice, and escaping notice for the sake of <lb/>
            deception.</p>

          <p>Against those indeed who deny whatever they <lb/>
            think contributes to the argument, an interrogation <lb/>
            must be made from negation, as if he (the querist) <note type="footnote"> I For which reason, Archytas Tarentinus spared his steward : “ Go," <lb/>

            but we must use it as granted, for sometimes they <lb/>

            similitude frequently escapes notice. In order also <lb/>
            to assume a proposition, we ought to make the <lb/>
            inquiry by a comparison of the contrary; as if it <lb/>
            should be necessary to assume, that it is right in <lb/>

            many things will seem to be conceded, for when contraries <lb/>

          <p>Moreover, as in rhetorical, so also in elenchtic <lb/>

            a similar manner, either (such as are contrary) <lb/>

            be such, or to similars, or to most, or to all. And <lb/>
            as also respondents frequently, when they are con­ <lb/>
            futed, assert that what they seem to be confuted in has a <lb/>
            two-fold meaning;1 so questionists must use this mode against <lb/>

            ing from the argument, to cut off the remaining <lb/>
            parts of the attacks, and for the respondent, if <lb/>
            he foresees, to anticipate in objection and speaking. <lb/>

            something dif­ <lb/>

            Sometimes also, we must attack something dif­ <lb/>
            ferent to the assertion, assuming that, if a person <lb/>
            has it not in his power to attack the position; <lb/>

            being mentioned, more caution can be used,) it <lb/>
            must be said that it universally happens in elenchi, <lb/>
            that we assert contradiction, because we deny <lb/>
            what the arguer asserted, but what he denied we <lb/>
            assert; but (we must not say that we begin to prove one <lb/>
            part of the contradiction) ;3 for instance, that there is the same <note type="footnote"> I Taylor inserts, " and that they deny it in one sense, and it is ap­ <lb/>
            proved by the opponent in another," and observes that what is here <lb/>
            said, is so obscure in the original, that he has been under the necessity <lb/>
            of paraphrasing it, to render it legible. The meaning however is, as <lb/>
            Waitz expresses it, that as the respondent foreseeing a refutation, en­ <lb/>
            deavours to escape by pleading a distinction in the meaning of a term, <lb/>
            so the questionist must use the same plea to remove an objection, in <lb/>
            order that he may adopt whatever sense is most suitable to confute his <lb/>

          <p>They are useful then to philosophy for two <lb/>
            causes; first, indeed, as being for the most part <lb/>
            from diction, they enable us to know in a better <lb/>
            manner, in how many ways each thing is predi- <lb/>
            2. The argu­ <lb/>
            ments discuss­ <lb/>
            ed are useful to <lb/>
            philosophy for <lb/>
            two causes. <lb/>
            cate, and what kind happen similarly, and what differently, <lb/>
            both in things and in names. Secondly, (they contribute) to <lb/>
            inquiries by oneself, for he who is easily deceived by a paralo­ <lb/>
            gism by another, and does not perceive this, may also himself <lb/>
            frequently experience the same thing from himself. Thirdly, <lb/>
            in the remaining place, (they tend) still more to fame from <lb/>
            appearing to be exercised about all things, and not to be un­ <lb/>
            skilful in any thing ; for that he who engages in disputation <lb/>
            should blame the arguments (of another), without being able <lb/>
            to distinguish any thing about their badness, produces a sus­ <lb/>
            picion of apparent indignation, not on account of the truth, <lb/>
            but on account of unskilfulness.</p>

            render it dubious whether a person is confuted by an elenchus <lb/>
            or not. For since it is possible at the end, when a conclusion <lb/>

            not be obscure, and what the contentious less require now <lb/>
            than formerly, viz. that the person questioned should answer <lb/>
            yes or no, should occur. Nevertheless, now because querists <lb/>
            do not question well, it is necessary that the person questioned <lb/>
            should add something to his answer, correcting the faultiness <lb/>
            of the proposition, § since it he, the querist, dis­ <lb/>

          <p>If, indeed, any one should suppose that to be <lb/>
            an elenchus, which is according to equivocation, <lb/>
            it will be impossible for the respondent in any <lb/>
            way to avoid confutation by an elenchus, for in <lb/>

            that there is some difference,l if, however, he assigns to the <lb/>

            guity to be <lb/>
            expounded.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, since it is dubious whether he <lb/>
            who does not distinguish the ambiguity, is con­ <lb/>
            futed by an elenchus or not, but it is allowed in <lb/>
            disputations to make a distinction, it is evident that he who <lb/>
            does not distinguish, but simply grants the interrogation, errs, <lb/>
            wherefore, if not the man himself, yet his argument, resembles <lb/>
            a confuted elenchus. It frequently happens, however, that <lb/>
            they who see the ambiguity, are unwilling to distinguish from <lb/>
            the frequency of those who propose things of this kind, that <lb/>
            they may not seem to be morose in every thing, and next, <lb/>

            Vide Wbately, <lb/>
            book iii.</p>
          <p>Unless, indeed, a person makes two interroga­ <lb/>
            tions to be one, there will not be a paralogism <lb/>
            from equivocation and ambiguity, but either an <lb/>
            elenchus or not. For what difference is there in <lb/>
            asking whether Callias and Themistocles are musi­ <lb/>
            cians, or whether to both, being different men, there is one <lb/>
            common name ? for if that signify more than one, he (who <lb/>
            uses it) will ask many things. If, then, it is not right to re­ <lb/>
            quire that we assume simply, one answer to two questions, it is <lb/>
            evidently not becoming to answer simply, any thing equivocal, <lb/>
            not even if, as some require, it be true in all; for this is just <lb/>
            the same as if it were asked, whether Coriscus and Callias <lb/>
            are at home or not ? whether both are present or not present ? <lb/>
            since in both ways the propositions are many. For it does not <lb/>

            tions asked, to all of which it may be true to answer yes or <lb/>
            no, yet nevertheless, one answer must not be given, for dis­ <lb/>
            putation would be subverted, and this is the same as if the <lb/>
            same name, should be assigned to different things. If, then, <lb/>
            it is not right to give one answer to two questions, it is evi­ <lb/>
            dent that we must not answer yes or no in things equivocal, <lb/>
            since neither does he who says this, answer, but speak, <lb/>
            (merely,)1 and this is claimed in a certain respect amongst <lb/>
            those who dispute, because the result is concealed.2</p>
          <p>As, therefore, we said since neither are certain <lb/>
            things, elenchi really, which seem to be so, in the <lb/>
            same manner also, certain will seem to be solutions <lb/>

            is to be made. <lb/>
            which are not, but which we say that sometimes it is necessary <lb/>
            to adduce rather than the true, in contentious arguments and <lb/>
            in opposition to (a paralogism from) duplicity. Likewise, we <lb/>
            must answer things which seem to be (true) by saying, " be <lb/>
            it so," for thus, least of all, would there be a parexelenchus, <lb/>
            but if a person should be compelled to assert some paradox, <lb/>
            there " to seem," must especially be added,* for <lb/>
            thus, there will appear to be neither an elenchus3 <lb/>
            nor a paradox. Since, however, it is clear how <lb/>
            * To the an­ <lb/>
            swer. <lb/>
            the original proposition is made a postulate, and men think <lb/>
            altogether (that it is made so), if it be near (the question) we <lb/>
            must subvert and not grant certain things, as if the interro­ <lb/>
            gator made a petitio principii, and when any one requires such <lb/>
            a thing to be granted which necessarily, indeed, results from <lb/>
            the thesis, but is false or contrary to opinion, it must be said <lb/>
            to be the same (as the question), for things consequent from <lb/>
            necessity appear to be parts of the thesis itself. Moreover, <lb/>
            when universal is assumed not in name but by comparison, it <lb/>
            must be said that he (the opponent) assumes it, not as it was <note type="footnote"> 1 Because what he replies to is nought, for he answers as if to one <lb/>

            ment ought not <lb/>
            to be simply <lb/>
            conceded.</p>
          <p>In names then, which are properly so called, it <lb/>
            is necessary to answer either simply or by dis­ <lb/>
            tinction. As to, however, those things which we <lb/>
            admit, secretly perceiving: them, for instance, <lb/>
            whatever are not clearly interrogated, but with diminution, <lb/>
            from this an elenchus happens, as, for instance, " Is what be­ <lb/>
            longs to the Athenians, the possession of the Athenians ?" <lb/>
            " Yes." In like manner, as to other things, " Does not man also <lb/>
            belong to animals ? ” " Yes." Man therefore is the possession <lb/>
            of animals. For we say that man is of animals, because he is <lb/>
            an animal, and Lysander is of the Lacedæmonians, because he <lb/>
            is a Lacedaemonian ; wherefore it is clear that where the pro­ <lb/>
            position is obscure, we must not make a simple concession.</p>

            other arts in <lb/>
            responsion.</p>
          <p>But when of two existents, the one existing, the <lb/>
            other also appears of necessity to exist,1 but this <lb/>
            existing, that does not from necessity; he who is <lb/>
            asked which of the two (he thinks exists) ought to give that <lb/>
            which is less (widely extended), for it is harder to syllogize <lb/>
            from many things.2 Yet if some one should argue that there <lb/>
            is something contrary to the one, but not to the other, even <lb/>
            if the assertion be true, we must say that the contrary (of the <lb/>
            other, is, but that the name of the other, is not laid down.</p>
          <p>2. Transference <lb/>
            of name.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, since some of the things which <lb/>
            the multitude assert, are such that he who does <lb/>
            not admit them, they would say, answered falsely, but others <lb/>
            are not such ; as those of which there are contrary opinions, (for <lb/>
            whether the soul of animals, is corruptible or incorruptible, is <lb/>
            not determined by the multitude,) in which then it is doubt­ <lb/>
            ful how it is usual to enunciate what is proposed, (so that <lb/>
            it may be asked) whether (it appears to the respondent) as <lb/>

            these, by transferring the names, a person would especially <lb/>

            truth subsists, he will not appear sophistically to cavil, and <lb/>
            from there being opinions on both sides, he will not seem to <lb/>
            answer falsely, for the transition will render his answer in­ <lb/>

          <p>SINCE however a right solution is the detection <lb/>
            of a false syllogism, (showing) by what interro­ <lb/>
            gation the falsity occurs ; but a syllogism is called <lb/>
            1. In what con­ <lb/>
            sists a true so­ <lb/>
            lution. <lb/>
            false in two ways, (either if it is falsely concluded, or if not <lb/>
            being a syllogism, it seems to be one,) what is now said to be <lb/>
            a solution will be a correction of an apparent syllogism, <lb/>
            (showing) from what interrogation it is apparent. Hence, it <lb/>
            happens that those arguments which conclude by syllogism, <lb/>
            are solved by negation, but apparent ones by distinction.2 <lb/>
            Again, since some of the arguments syllogistically concluded <lb/>
            are true, but others have a false conclusion; those which are <lb/>
            false, according to the conclusion, we may solve in two ways, by <lb/>
            taking away some one of the interrogations, and by showing <lb/>
            that the conclusion does not thus subsist; but those (which <lb/>
            are false), according to the propositions,3 by taking away some <note type="footnote"> I I have given this paragraph as literally as it could be rendered con­ <lb/>

            sentence will have neither apodosis, nor meaning. The rule conveyed is, <lb/>
            that if any doubt exist of the truth of a proposition, we ought to change <lb/>
            the names, in order to avoid the appearance of sophism, being defended <lb/>
            by the acknowledged mutability of opinion, from the charge of advancing <lb/>
            a falsity. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Taylor has translated this erroneously, but gives the general meaning <lb/>

            (interrogation) only, for the conclusion is true. <lb/>
            So that they who desire to solve an argument, <lb/>
            should first consider if it is conclusive or incon­ <lb/>
            clusive ; next, whether the conclusion is true or <lb/>
            false, that we may solve it either by division or <lb/>
            subversion, and subverting it either in this or that way, as <lb/>
            was observed before. Still, it makes a great difference whe­ <lb/>

            ing many things, but others a conclusion multi­ <lb/>
            fariously stated; for instance in the case, that he <lb/>

            that he who knows, at the same time does not know,1 one in­ <lb/>

            theless it is from composition. For what is assumed from <lb/>
            division is not two-fold, because there does not arise the same <lb/>

            name is the same, since it is written from the same elements, <lb/>
            and after the same manner, and there indeed the marks are the <lb/>
            same, but the things pronounced are different. Hence what is <lb/>
            assumed from division is not two-fold, and it is likewise clear <lb/>

          <p>The respondent therefore must make a distinc­ <lb/>
            tion, for it is not the same thing for a man to say, <lb/>
            that he saw some one striking with his eyes, and that with <lb/>
            his eyes he saw some one striking, and the argument of <lb/>

            shoemaker?" but some one being a good shoemaker, may be <lb/>
            bad, so that there will be a bad shoemaker. (Again,) “ Are <lb/>
            those exercises worthy, of which the sciences are worthy ?” but <lb/>
            the exercise of a bad man is worthy; wherefore, what is bad, <lb/>
            is a worthy exercise, but what is bad is both an exercise and <lb/>
            that which is bad, so that what is bad, is a bad exercise. “ Is <lb/>
            it true to say now that you are born ? you are therefore born <lb/>

            that you are now born. As to the manner in which you are <lb/>
            able, and the things which you are able to do, will you do <lb/>

            indeed grants when interrogated, that it is not <lb/>
            any of those things which signify essence, but <lb/>
            the other shows that it is one of the number of <lb/>
            relatives or quantities, and seems to signify essence <lb/>
            on account of the diction, for instance, in this <lb/>
            argument. Is it possible to do, and to have done, the same <lb/>
            thing at the same time ? No. But it is possible to see, and at <lb/>
            the same time to have seen, the same thing, and according to <lb/>
            • Cf. Sop. Elen. <lb/>
            the same.*1 Is it possible for any thing which suf­ <lb/>
            fers, to act ? No. But “ it is cut," " it is burned," <lb/>
            "it is perceived, are enunciated similarly, and all signify to <lb/>
            suffer something ; again, " to speak," " to run," " to see " are <lb/>
            enunciated similarly with each other, but “to see" is to per­ <lb/>
            ceive something, so that it is to suffer, and to act something, at <lb/>
            one and the same time. Still, if any one having there granted <lb/>
            that it is impossible to do and to have done the same thing <lb/>
            at the same time, should say that it is possible to see and to <lb/>
            have seen, he is not yet confuted, if he should not say that “ to <lb/>
            see" is to do something, but to suffer, for there is no need of this <lb/>
            interrogation, but he is supposed by the hearer to have granted <lb/>
            this, when he granted that " to cut" is to do, and " to cut" is to <lb/>
            have done something, and whatever other things are similarly <lb/>
            asserted. For the auditor himself supplies the rest as asserted <lb/>
            in a similar manner, but this is not similarly asserted, but <lb/>
            seems to be so from the diction. The same thing indeed hap­ <lb/>
            pens, as in equivocations, for in them, he who is ignorant of <lb/>
            words, thinks that (the opponent) denies the thing which (the <lb/>
            respondent affirms), and not the name (only), though there is <lb/>
            still need of an interrogation, whether regarding one thing he <lb/>
            asserts the equivocal, for this being granted there will be an <lb/>
            elenchus.</p>
          <p>2. Examples <lb/>
            continued.</p>
          <p>The following arguments also are like these. <lb/>
            Whether has some one lost that, which once <note type="footnote"> 1 These are similar expressions, yet an invalid argument alone is de­ <lb/>
            rived from them, since to do and to have done is agency, but to see and <lb/>
            to have seen signify passive qualities elicited in the percipient, by the <lb/>
            object. So, Pet. Hisp. Sum. Log. Tract. 6, speaking of this fallacy, as <lb/>
            “ multiplex phantasticum,” observes, “ Est autem multiplex phantasti­ <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. XXII.]"/>having, he afterwards has not? for he who has lost one <lb/>
            die will not have ten dice, or may we not say that he has <lb/>
            lost what he has not (now), but which he had before; but <lb/>
            that it is not necessary that he who had not so much, or <lb/>
            so many things, should have lost so many. Asking then, <lb/>
            what he has, in the conclusion he introduces so many, for ten <lb/>
            things are so many; if then, it had been asked at first, has he <lb/>
            who has not so many things as he formerly had, lost so many, <lb/>
            no one would admit it, but either that he had lost so many, or <lb/>
            some one of these. Also (the deception is similar), that some <lb/>
            one may give what he has not, for he has not one die only, or <lb/>
            does he not give that which he has not, but as to the manner <lb/>
            in which he had it not, viz. one, for the word " only," does not <lb/>
            signify this particular thing, nor such a quality, nor quantity, <lb/>
            but how it subsists with relation to something, (i. e.) that it is <lb/>
            not with another.1 It is therefore as if some one asked, can. <lb/>
            any one give what he has not, and if a person denied it, should <lb/>
            ask whether any one can give rapidly, when he does not pos­ <lb/>
            sess rapidly, and this being agreed to, should conclude that a <lb/>
            man may give what he has not. It is also manifest that it is <lb/>
            not syllogistically considered, (for to give) rapidly is not to <lb/>
            give this thing, but in this way, and a person may give in a <lb/>
            manner different from that in which he possesses, for possess­ <lb/>
            ing it gladly, he may give it painfully.</p>
          <p>Similar also are all the following: Can any <lb/>
            one strike with that hand which he has not ? or <lb/>
            3. Examples. <lb/>
            see with the eye which he has not, for he has not one alone.2 <note type="footnote"> 1 I read this puzzling paragraph with Waitz; the sophistry seems to <lb/>
            be this: He who had ten dice, having lost one, has no longer ten, there­ <lb/>
            fore he has lost ten, which is absurd. The solution is, He who had <lb/>
            something, having it not now, has lost that something, yet it is not neces­ <lb/>
            sary that he who had so many or so much, and now has not, should have <lb/>
            lost so many or so much, since a man who once had ten things, but has <lb/>
            not them now, need not have lost ten, but may only have lost one or two. <lb/>
            Again, it is not absurd to say that he who has one die without other dice, <lb/>
            may give a die without other dice. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 When it is denied that a man can strike with that hand which he has <lb/>
            not, or can see with that eye which he has not, the sophist argues: He <lb/>
            alone strikes with one hand, he sees with one eye alone; but he has not <lb/>
            one hand alone, nor one eye alone; therefore he strikes with a hand <lb/>
            which he has not, and sees with an eye which he has not. The solution <lb/>
            is the same as in the fourth example, for the particle "alone," does not <lb/>
            signify that which is possessed, in the relation of the thing possessed. </note> <pb n="588"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[CHAP. XXII."/>Some indeed solve this by saying, that he has one alone, whe­ <lb/>
            ther it be an eye or any thing else, who has more than one, <lb/>
            but others that he has received what he has, for he gave one <lb/>
            die alone, and this man has, they say, one die alone from this <lb/>
            man. Others, again, immediately subverting the question, <lb/>
            (say) that it is possible to have what he has not received, as <lb/>
            if having received sweet wine, when it is corrupted in the re­ <lb/>
            ceiving of it, a man should have sour wine; still, as we have <lb/>
            observed before, all these solve, not with reference to the <lb/>
            argument, but to the man. For if this were the solution, he <lb/>
            who gave the opposite would not be able to solve it, as in <lb/>
            other cases; thus, if the solution is, that it partly is, but <lb/>
            partly is not, if it be simply granted, there is a conclusion, <lb/>
            but if there is not a conclusion, there cannot be a solution; <lb/>
            but in the before-named, all things being granted, we do not <lb/>
            admit that there is a syllogism.</p>
          <p>4. Examples.</p>
          <p>Further, of such arguments are the following: <lb/>
            Has some one written what is written ? But <lb/>
            it is written that you now sit, which is a false statement, <lb/>
            yet it was true when it was written, wherefore at one and the <lb/>
            same time, there was written a false and a true assertion. To <lb/>
            declare, however, an assertion or opinion false or true, signi­ <lb/>
            fies, not this particular thing, but this quality, for the reason­ <lb/>
            ing also is the same in opinion. Again,1 as to what a learner <lb/>
            • The oppon­ <lb/>
            ent. <lb/>
            learns, is it that which he learns ? but some one <lb/>
            learns quickly what is slow, therefore he * does <lb/>
            not say what some one learns, but how he learns. <lb/>
            Again, what a person walks through does he tread on ? But <lb/>
            he walks through the whole day, it is not said that which he <lb/>
            walks upon, but when he walks;2 nor when (we say) he <lb/>
            drinks a cup (do we show) what, but from what, he drinks. <lb/>
            Also with regard to what a person knows, does he know it by <lb/>
            learning or discovery ? but of those, one of which he discovers <lb/>
            and the other he learns, (with these,) when both are (as­ <lb/>
            sumed), neither (accords): or is it that here " every thing" <note type="footnote"> Taylor. Of. Blair on Precision in Style, at the words " only," " alone." <lb/>

            cular thing, but the other a thing of a certain quality, so that <lb/>
            we cannot set out this ;3 nor does the exposition make a third <lb/>
            man, but the concession, (that what is common) is that very <lb/>
            thing which is this particular thing, for (thus) to be this <lb/>
            particular thing, is not that which Callias is, and which man <lb/>
            is. Neither will it signify, if some one should say that what <lb/>
            is set out, is not what this particular thing is, but what is a <lb/>
            thing of a certain quality, for besides the many, there will be <lb/>
            one certain thing, for instance man. We must <lb/>
            evidently therefore, not grant that what is predi­ <lb/>
            cated in common of many, is this particular thing, <lb/>
            but that it signifies either quality, or relation, or <lb/>
            quantity, or something of the kind. <lb/>

            sophisms must <lb/>

            which he has not; for instance, one die alone.1 What any <lb/>
            one knows, does he know by learning or discovery, and yet <lb/>
            not the things which he knows, and does he tread on what he <lb/>

          <p>WITH respect to those which are from accident, <lb/>
            there is one and the same solution for all of <lb/>
            them, for since it is uncertain when an assertion <lb/>
            can be made of a thing present from accident, and <lb/>
            in some things this appears and is conceded, but in <lb/>
            others, men deny that it is necessary, it must be <lb/>
            said as being * similarly adapted to all, that (the <lb/>
            conclusion) is not necessary. Nevertheless, it is <lb/>
            necessary to produce something similar. All such <lb/>

            which according to essence are without difference and one, all <lb/>

            is intended to be asked, neither to him who approaches or <lb/>
            who is covered, is it the same thing to be one approaching, <lb/>

            swearing that he shall be perjured when he swears, he swears <lb/>
            this alone in a proper manner, but he does not swear (simply) <lb/>

            disbelieves, but he believes a certain thing. Simi­ <lb/>

            ing falsely and truly at the same time,1 but from its not being <lb/>
            easy to perceive, whether a person assigns the word simply to <lb/>
            the speaking truly or falsely, it (the solution) seems difficult. <lb/>
            Still there is nothing to prevent it being false, indeed, simply, <lb/>
            but in a certain respect, or of a certain thing, true, also certain <lb/>
            things being true and yet not true (simply). Similarly also, <lb/>
            in regard to the terms, "with reference to something," and <lb/>
            “where” and "when," for all such arguments result from <lb/>
            this. Is health or wealth a good thing ? but to the foolish <lb/>
            and to one who does not use it properly, it is not good, where­ <lb/>
            fore it is good and not good. Is to be well or to be powerful <lb/>
            in a city a good thing ? Sometimes this is not better, there­ <lb/>
            fore the same thing is good or not good to the same. Or does <lb/>
            nothing prevent what is simply good, not being good to a <lb/>
            certain person, or good to this man, but not now, or not good <lb/>
            here. Is that which a prudent man would not desire, an evil ? <lb/>
            But he does not desire to lose good, wherefore good is evil, <lb/>
            for it is not the same thing, to say that good is evil, and to <lb/>
            lose good. Likewise, also, the argument about the thief, since <lb/>
            it does not follow if a thief is a bad thing, that to take him is <lb/>
            also bad, therefore he (who wishes to take him) does not de­ <lb/>
            sire a bad, but a good thing, for to take a thief is a good <lb/>
            thing, and disease is bad, but not to lose disease. Is the just <note type="footnote"> 1 It is evident that we may believe a person relatively about some­ <lb/>
            thing, but not in every thing, or simply, yet this is no proof that we can <lb/>
            simply believe and not believe, him. The fallacy touched upon previ­ <lb/>
            ously in the text and compared with the place given in the Ethics, <lb/>
            Cicero denominates " Mentiens," and thus enumerates it, " Si dicis te <lb/>

            mentiris igitur." Acad. Quæst. iv. 30. Its solution is easy enough. <lb/>
            If a man lies, he does so about something; but the something is not <lb/>
            stated in the sophism, " As Mansel says, the question as it stands is <lb/>
            unmeaning." Is this thing very like? Like what? Vide Mansel, 129; <lb/>

            ustly. <lb/>
            4 A judge. <lb/>
            die unjustly is preferable.* Is it just for every <lb/>
            man to have his own property, yet those which <lb/>
            some one † according to his own opinion adj udges, <lb/>
            though it be false, are the property (of that person) by law, <lb/>
            therefore the same thing is just and unjust. Also, whether <lb/>
            is it necessary to condemn him who speaks justly, or him who <lb/>
            speaks unjustly ? Yet it is just that the injured should state <lb/>
            sufficiently what he has suffered, but. these would be unjust <lb/>
            things, since it does not follow if to suffer any thing unjustly <lb/>
            is eligible, the unjustly is more eligible than the justly, but <lb/>
            ‡ Is more <lb/>
            eligible. <lb/>
            simply indeed the justly,t yet nothing hinders <lb/>
            this particular thing, though unjustly (done, being <lb/>
            more eligible) than what is justly (done).1 Also, <lb/>
            for every one to have his own is just, but to have another <lb/>
            person's, is not just, yet nothing hinders this judgment from <lb/>
            being just, e. g. if it be according to the opinion of the judge, <lb/>
            since it does not follow if this thing is just or in this way, <lb/>
            that it is simply just. Likewise, also, those which are unjust, <lb/>
            nothing prevents its being just to relate them, since it does <lb/>
            not follow, if it is just to relate them, necessarily that the <lb/>
            things are just, as neither if it is beneficial to speak of them, <lb/>
            (does it follow) they are beneficial; and the like of just things. <lb/>
            Wherefore if things asserted are unjust, it does not follow <lb/>
            that he who speaks unjust things prevails, for he says those <lb/>
            things which are just to say, but simply, and unjust to bear.</p>

            terrogation not being simple, it happens that those who an­ <lb/>

            in these cases. When then many are present <lb/>
            t Inconveni­ <lb/>
            ent. <lb/>

            him who simply concedes, and who errs according to this <lb/>
            error; but when it is in one, but not in the other, or many <lb/>
            are predicated of many, and both are partly present with <lb/>
            both, and partly not, this, again, is to be avoided. For in­ <lb/>
            stance, in these arguments: If one thing is good, but another <lb/>
            evil, it is true to say that these are good and evil, and again, <lb/>
            that they are neither good nor evil, since each is not each, <lb/>
            wherefore the same thing is good and evil, and is neither good <lb/>
            nor evil. Also, Is every thing the same with itself, and dif­ <lb/>
            ferent from something else ? but since these are not the same <lb/>
            with others, but with themselves, and are different from them­ <lb/>
            selves, the same things are different from, and the same with, <lb/>
            themselves. Besides, if what is good becomes evil, and what <lb/>
            is evil good, there will be two things, and of two, being <lb/>
            unequal, each itself will be equal to itself, so that the same <lb/>
            things will be equal and unequal to themselves.</p>
          <p>Such arguments, then, fall into other solutions,2 <lb/>
            for "both" also, and "all" signify many things,‡ <lb/>
            wherefore, except the name, it does not happen <lb/>

          <p>WITH regard to those which lead to frequently <lb/>
            saying the same thing, we must evidently not <lb/>
            grant that the categories of relatives, separated <lb/>
            by themselves, signify any thing; as the double <lb/>
            without the double of the half, because it is mani­ <lb/>
            fest ;1 for ten is (understood) in (the expression) <lb/>
            ten minus one, and "to make" in the (expression) "not to <lb/>
            make," jn short, affirmation in negation, yet still it does not <lb/>
            follow, if a man says that this is not white, that he should say <lb/>
            it is white. Perhaps indeed, the double signifies nothing <lb/>
            (alone), as neither what is in the half, or if indeed it does <lb/>
            signify any thing, yet not the same as when conjuined.2 Noc <lb/>
            does science in species (as if it is medical science) signify <lb/>
            what is common, but that was the science of the object of sci­ <lb/>
            ence. Indeed, in those attributes through which (the sub­ <lb/>
            jects) are declared,3 we must say this, that what is signified <note type="footnote"> 1 It is evident that the double is the double of the half. Taylor trans­ <lb/>
            lates it, " because it appears to be one thing." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 " Negation does not signify affirmation, and yet it cannot be under­ <lb/>
            stood without affirmation: " wherefore, when I say,“ Socrates is not white, <lb/>
            though what I say cannot be understood, unless the affirmation of white <lb/>
            is understood, yet I do not signify the affirmation of white. Hence, it is <lb/>
            one thing, that a name or a sentence signifies something which cannot be <lb/>
            understood without another thing, and it is another thing that it signifies <lb/>
            that other thing. Though the signification of the double therefore can­ <lb/>
            not be understood unless the half is understood, to which the double is <lb/>
            referred, yet the double does not signify the half. And if it should sig­ <lb/>
            nify something to which it is referred, yet it does not signify the same <lb/>
            thing, assumed by itself, and posited in a sentence. Hence it appears <lb/>
            that there is not a negation. For when it is said that the double is the <lb/>
            double of the half, since the double by itself does not signify the half, at <lb/>
            least, expressly, a repetition is not made, nor does it follow that it should <lb/>
            be said, the double is the double of the half of the half." Taylor. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 " In those attributes which are manifested through subjects—” Taylor <lb/>

            you say that something is a stone, something then <lb/>
            is a stone. Or is to say a stone, not to say "quod" <lb/>

            stated in these <lb/>
            cases that the <lb/>
            opponent not <lb/>
            really, but only <lb/>
            apparently, <lb/>
            concludes a <lb/>
            solecism, be­ <lb/>
            cause we seem <lb/>
            to have granted, <lb/>
            what we have <lb/>
            not granted. <lb/>
            one should ask; Num quern vere dicis est hunc ?1 he would not <lb/>
            seem to speak conformably to the Latin § language, <lb/>
            as neither if he should say; Num quam dicis esse, <lb/>
            § Greek. <lb/>
            est hie ? but when he says wood, or whatever signifies neither <lb/>
            the feminine nor the masculine, it makes no difference. <lb/>
            Wherefore, a solecism does not arise, if what you say is, be <lb/>
            " hoc," but you say that wood is, this therefore is wood: <lb/>
            a " stone," however, and "hie," have the appellation of the <lb/>
            masculine. If, indeed, some one should inquire is he, she ? <lb/>
            and again, what ? (quid) ? Is not he Coriscus ? and then <lb/>
            should say, he therefore is she, he does not syllogistically <lb/>
            collect a solecism, not even if Coriscus signify, what she <note type="footnote"> as having the same signification, when enunciated alone, with that which <lb/>

            sary that this should be questioned, besides. If, however, it <lb/>
            neither is nor is granted, it is not syllogistically collected, <lb/>
            neither in reality nor against him who is questioned, hence in <lb/>
            like manner there also, it is necessary that a stone should <lb/>
            signify Axe, but if this neither is (assumed) nor granted, we <lb/>
            must not admit the conclusion, nevertheless it seems to be <lb/>
            from the dissimilar case of the noun appearing similar. Is it <lb/>

            not necessary * if hœc does not signify parmam, but <lb/>
            parma,t but parmam is hanc. Neither if what <lb/>
            you say is hunc be hie, but you say it is Cleon,l <lb/>
            therefore hie is Cleon,2 hie is not Cleon,3 for it was said, quem <lb/>
            aio hunc esse, est hie, non hunc; for when the question is thus <lb/>
            made it is not according to the rules of grammar. Do you <lb/>
            know hoc ? but this is a stone, you know then a stone, or does <lb/>
            it not signify the same thing in the expression, do you know <lb/>
            hoc? and in hoc autem est lapis? but this is a stone? but <lb/>
            that in the former it signifies hunc and in the latter hic. <lb/>
            Num cujus scientiam habes hoc, scis ? Habes autem scientiam <lb/>
            lapidis: scis igitur lapidis; is it not that when you say hujus, <lb/>
            you say lapidis, but when you say hoc, lapidem? but it is <lb/>
            granted cujus scientiam habes, te scire, non hujus, sed hoc; <lb/>
            and therefore non lapidis, sed lapidem.</p>
          <p>From what is stated then, it is manifest that such argu­ <lb/>
            ments as these do not syllogistically collect a solecism, but <lb/>
            seem (only) to do so, also why they thus seem, and in what <lb/>

            tion, which mode of paralogism seems to be the most usual, <lb/>
            some are manifest to every one, (for almost all absurd sentences <lb/>
            are from diction, for instance, Vir ferebat per scalas <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίφϱον</foreign> ; <lb/>

            chus ? No, but Apollonides ;2 and almost all other deceptions <lb/>
            in the same manner.) Some seem notwithstanding to escape <lb/>
            the most experienced, a proof of which is, that they oftentimes <lb/>
            contend about names, as whether the one and being are predi­ <lb/>
            cated in the same signification, or in a different one, of all <lb/>
            things. For to some indeed, being and the one­ <lb/>
            seem to signify the same thing, but others solve <lb/>
            the argument of Zeno and Parmenides, from say­ <lb/>

            Logic, App. i. <lb/>
            17. <lb/>
            ing that one and being are predicated multifariously.3 Like­ <lb/>
            wise, also with regard to those derived from accident and each <lb/>
            of the other (places), some arguments will be easy to perceive, <lb/>
            but others difficult, and it is not alike easy in all, to perceive <note type="footnote"> 1 That is, they are referred to the same kind of deception. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This last is a mere pun upon the etymology of the word, Evarchus <lb/>
            being a good manager, but Apollonides a destroyer. Of the other ex­ <lb/>
            amples given above which all turn upon equivocation, some are evident, <lb/>
            others obscure. Amongst the first kind we may reckon: " A man put <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίφϱος</foreign>, (a bench or a chariot,) through a ladder," of course in one sense <lb/>
            it is true, in the other, false. Again, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅπου στέλλεσθε</foreign>, a pun upon the differ­ <lb/>
            ent meanings of being " sent" and of “shortening sails." Again, some one <lb/>
            asks: Which of the cows was delivered of a calf, ante, i. e. prior or first, <lb/>
            but the respondent, playing upon the signification of “ante," " before," <lb/>
            applies it not to time, but to the anterior part of the body. Lastly, <foreign xml:lang="grc">καθαϱὸς</foreign> <lb/>
            means " pure " and " harmless," so that Boreas may be called so in the first <lb/>
            sense because it purifies, but not in the last, because it killed two people <lb/>
            with cold. In fact, as Whately and others have remarked, jests are mock <lb/>
            fallacies, i. e. fallacies so palpable as not to be likely to deceive any one, <lb/>
            yet bearing just that resemblance to argument which is calculated to <lb/>

            should speak of the thing proposed, wherefore in the syllo­ <lb/>
            gistic, the shrewder arguments cause greater investigation, but <lb/>
            a syllogistic argument is most acute, if from things which a- <lb/>

            firms.” Taylor <lb/>
            and Buhle. <lb/>
            pear especially probable, a person subverts t what <lb/>
            is especially probable. For the argument being <lb/>
            one, when the contradiction is transposed,2 will <lb/>
            have all the syllogisms alike,3 for a person will always, from <lb/>
            probable assertions, subvert or confirm what is similarly pro­ <lb/>
            bable, wherefore it will be necessary to doubt. An argument <lb/>
            then of this kind is especially acute, which makes a conclu­ <lb/>
            sion equal to the questions,4 but that next, which is from all <lb/>
            similar (assumptions), for this in like manner will produce <lb/>
            doubt, as to which of the interrogatories is to be subverted; <lb/>
            nevertheless, this is difficult, since a subversion is to be made, <lb/>
            but what is to be subverted is uncertain. Of contentious <lb/>
            arguments, the most acute is that in which at first it is forth­ <lb/>
            with uncertain whether it is syllogistically concluded or not, <lb/>
            and whether the solution is from the false or from division, <lb/>
            but the second of the rest is that which evidently must be <lb/>
            (solved) through division or removal, but in which it is not <lb/>
            clear through the removal or division of what interrogation <lb/>
            it must be solved, indeed whether this removal or division is <lb/>
            from the conclusion, or from one of the interrogatories.</p>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[CHAP. XXXIV."/>on this account we not only supposed what was said to be the <lb/>
            object of this treatise, viz. to be able to assume an argument, <lb/>
            but also that sustaining the argument, we may defend the <lb/>
            thesis in a similar manner, through the greatest probabilities. <lb/>
            We have besides, assigned the cause of this ;1 since, for this <lb/>
            reason also, Socrates questioned, but did not answer, for he <lb/>
            confessed that he knew nothing Moreover, it has been <lb/>

            to how many,. and from what number t this will <lb/>
            be, and whence we shall be well supplied with <lb/>
            these; further, how interrogations must be made, and how <lb/>
            every one must be arranged, and likewise, concerning the <lb/>
            answers and solutions of things appertaining to syllogisms. <lb/>
            Such other particulars besides, have been developed as belong <lb/>
            to the same method of arguments, and in addition to these, we <lb/>
            have discussed paralogisms, as we stated before, wherefore, it <lb/>
            is evident that what we proposed has sufficiently obtained its <lb/>
            end. Still we ought not to be ignorant of that which occurs in <lb/>
            this treatise; for of all discoveries, some being received <lb/>
            formerly from others,3 elaborated partially afterwards, have <lb/>
            been increased by those who received them ; but others being <lb/>
            discovered from the beginning, are wont to receive, at first, <lb/>
            but small increase, becoming much more useful by the in­ <lb/>
            crease which they receive from others afterwards. For the <lb/>
            beginning of every thing is perhaps, as it is said, the greatest <lb/>
            thing, and on this account the most difficult; for that is the <lb/>
            hardest to be perceived, which, as it is the most powerful in <lb/>
            faculty, is by so much the smallest in size ; yet when this is <lb/>
            discovered, it is more easy to add and co-increase what re- <note type="footnote"> 1 He here appears to refer to what is stated in the first chapter of this <lb/>

            notwithstanding the testimony of the oracle to his being the wisest of <lb/>
            men, (Plat. Apol., p. 21,) but because he had a mean opinion of the <lb/>

            contentious arguments for gain, there was a cer­ <lb/>

            learn, into which each thought their conversation with each <lb/>
            other would most often fall. Hence the instruction indeed to <lb/>
            their disciples was rapid, but without art, since they supposed <lb/>
            they should instruct them by delivering not art, but the effects <lb/>
            of art, just as if a person professing to deliver the science of <lb/>
            keeping feet from injury, should afterwards not teach shoe­ <lb/>
            making, nor whence such things (as safe-guards for the feet) <lb/>
            may be procured, but should exhibit many kinds of shoes of <lb/>
            every form; for he would indeed afford assistance <lb/>
            as to use, yet not discover the art.§ And indeed, <lb/>

          <p>SINCE it is necessary, Chrysaorius, both to the <lb/>
            doctrine of Aristotle's Categories, to know what <lb/>
            genus, difference, species, property, and accident <lb/>
            are, and also to the assignments of definitions, in <lb/>
            short, since the investigation of these is useful for <lb/>
            those things which belong to division and demon­ <lb/>
            stration,2 I will endeavour by a summary briefly to <lb/>
            1. Knowledge <lb/>
            of the predica­ <lb/>
            bles requisite <lb/>
            as preliminary <lb/>
            to that of the <lb/>
            Aristotelian <lb/>
            Categories, and <lb/>
            the Platonic <lb/>
            dialectic. <lb/>
            discuss to you, as in the form of introduction, what on this sub­ <lb/>
            ject has been delivered by the ancients, abstaining, indeed, from <lb/>
            more profound questions, yet directing attention in a fitting <lb/>
            manner, to such as are more simple. For instance, I shall <note type="footnote"> 1 At the request of Chrysaorius, his pupil, who had recently met with <lb/>
            the Categories of Aristotle, Porphyry wrote this introduction, in order <lb/>
            to his comprehension of that treatise: nearly the whole of it is composed <lb/>
            from the writings, and often almost in the very words of Plato. As <lb/>
            philosophers reduced all things under ten common natures, as gram­ <lb/>
            marians also, with respect to eight words, so Porphyry has comprehended <lb/>
            every significant word, except such as are significant of individuals, under <lb/>
            five terms. The five heads of predicables therefore, taken from this <lb/>
            Isagoge, which was written in the third century, are an addition to the <lb/>
            Aristotelian Logic, in part of which, (the Topics,) the doctrine laid down <lb/>
            differs from that enunciated here, in several points, as Porphyry's view <lb/>
            also differs from that of Aldrich. Upon the subject generally, the reader <lb/>
            may compare Albertus Magnus de Prædicab. Aquinas. Occam Logica. <lb/>
            Abelard de Gen. et Spec. ed Cousin. Trendelenb. Elem. Crakanthorpe's, <lb/>
            Whately's, Hill's, and Wallis' Logics, also Boethius de Divisione. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Dialectic, according to Plato, consists of four parts, division, defini­ <lb/>
            tion, demonstration, and analysis; hence a treatise adapted to the forma­ <lb/>
            tion of these, will be evidently useful to the dialectic of Plato. The differ­ <lb/>
            ence between the dialectic of Plato and that of Aristotle, is noticed in the <lb/>
            subsequent notes upon the Organon, and the reader will find the subject <lb/>
            ably discussed in the introduction to Mansel's Logic; here we need only <lb/>
            observe that Aristotle in the Topics, looks to opinion (in his treatment of <lb/>
            dialectic), while Plato disregards it, and the former delivers many argu­ <lb/>

            problems. Cf. Proclus. MSS. commentary on the Parmenides, Philip., <lb/>

            they are either prior to the many, or in the many, or posterior to the <lb/>

            be in the many, and the image remaining in the conception of the spec­ <lb/>
            tator, after the many, and of posterior origin. This he applies to genus <lb/>

            him, denominated according to separation from <lb/>
            other genera.* Again, after another manner also, <lb/>
            the principle of the generation of every one is <lb/>
            called genus, whether from the generator or from <lb/>

            we say that Orestes had his genus from Tantalus, Hyllus from <lb/>
            Hercules, and again, that Pindar was by genus a Theban, but <lb/>
            Plato an Athenian, for country is a certain principle of each <lb/>
            man's generation, in the same manner as a father. Still, this <lb/>
            signification appears to be most ready,l for they are called <lb/>
            Heraclidæ who derive their origin from the genus of Hercules, <lb/>
            and Cecropidæ who are from Cecrops ; also their next of kin. <lb/>
            The first genus, moreover, is so called, which is the princi­ <lb/>
            ple of each man's generation, but afterwards the number of <lb/>
            those who are from one principle, e. g. from Hercules, which <lb/>
            defining and separating from others, we call the whole col­ <lb/>
            lected multitude the genus of the Heraclidæ.</p>
          <p>Again, in another way that is denominated <lb/>
            genus to which the species is subject, called per­ <lb/>
            haps from the similitude of these; for such a ge­ <lb/>
            nus is a certain principle of things under it, and <lb/>
            seems also to comprehend all the multitude under <lb/>
            itself. As then, genus is predicated triply, the <lb/>
            consideration by philosophers is concerning the <lb/>
            third, which also they explain by description, <lb/>
            3. Or that to <lb/>

            wnen tney say tnat genus is tnat which is predicated 01 many <lb/>
            things differing in species, in answer to what a thing is, e. g. <note type="footnote"> 1 Ammonius remarks that, " It is worth while to doubt why Porphyry <lb/>
            says that the first signification of genus appears to be the one easily <lb/>
            adopted, and not the second signification, which is the habitude of one <lb/>
            thing to one; since this nature first knows, for she first produces one <lb/>
            thing from one, and thus many from many." But as Taylor observes, the <lb/>
            second signification of genus, which is second with reference to us, is first <lb/>
            to nature; for from Hercules, one mail is first produced, and thus after­ <lb/>
            wards the multitude of the Heraclidæ. Universally, whatever is first to <lb/>
            nature is second to us, and vice versâ, e. g. she begins with form and <lb/>
            matter, then flesh and bone; we begin from man, so that things prior to <lb/>
            nature are posterior to our knowledge, wherefore the first signification <lb/>
            is clearer than the second. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 R 2 </note> <pb n="612"/>

            animal. For of predicates some are predicated <lb/>
            of one thing alone, as individuals, for instance, <lb/>
            " Socrates," and "this man," and this thing ;” <lb/>
            but others are predicated of many, as genera, <lb/>
            species, differences, properties, and accidents, pre­ <lb/>
            dicated in common, but not peculiarly to any one. <lb/>
            Now genus is such as " animal," species as " man," <lb/>
            difference as " rational," property as " risible," ac­ <lb/>
            cident as " white," " black," " to sit." From such <lb/>
            things then, as are predicated of one thing only, ge­ <lb/>
            nera differ in that they are predicated of many, but <lb/>
            on the other hand, from those which are predicated <lb/>
            of many and from species, (they differ) because <lb/>
            those species are predicated of many things, yet not <lb/>
            of those which differ in species, but in number only, for man <lb/>
            being a species, is predicated of Socrates and Plato, who do <lb/>
            not differ from each other in species, but in number, while <lb/>
            animal being a genus is predicated of man, and ox, and horse, <lb/>
            7. From pro­ <lb/>
            perty. Cf. ch. 9. <lb/>
            which differ also in species from each other, and <lb/>
            not in number only. From property, moreover, <lb/>
            genus differs because property is predicated of <lb/>
            one species alone of which it is the property, and of the indivi­ <lb/>
            duals under the species, as " risible " of man alone, and of men <lb/>
            particularly, for genus is not predicated of one species, but of <lb/>
            8. From differ­ <lb/>

            And accident. <lb/>
            Cf. ch. 10. <lb/>
            many things, Which are also different in species. <lb/>
            Besides, genus differs from difference and from <lb/>
            accidents in common, because though differences <lb/>
            and accidents in common are predicated of many <lb/>
            things, different also in species, yet they are not so in reply <lb/>
            9. Genus predi­ <lb/>

            ence and acci­ <lb/>

            Top. iv. 2. <lb/>
            to what a thing is, but (what kind of a thing) it is. <lb/>
            For when some persons ask what that is of which <lb/>
            these are predicated, we reply, that it is genus; <lb/>
            but we do not assign in answer differences and <lb/>
            accidents, since they are not predicated of a sub­ <lb/>
            ject, as to what a thing is, but rather as to what <lb/>
            kind of a thing it is. For in reply to the question, what kind <lb/>
            of a thing man is, we say, that he is rational, and in answer <lb/>
            to what kind of a thing a crow is, we say that it is black, yet <note type="footnote"> I Genus specie bus materia est. Nam sicut æs, acceptâ forma, transit <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. II.]"/>rational is difference, but black is accident. When however <lb/>
            we are asked what man is, we answer, an animal, but animal <lb/>
            is the genus of man, so that from genus being predicated of <lb/>
            many, it is diverse from individuals which are predicated of <lb/>
            one thing only, but from being predicated of things different <lb/>
            in species, it is distinguished from such as are predicated as <lb/>
            species or as properties. Moreover, because it is predicated in <lb/>
            reply to what a thing is, it is distinguished from differences <lb/>
            and from accidents commonly, which are severally predicated <lb/>
            of what they are predicated, not in reply to what a thing is, <lb/>
            but what kind of a thing it is, or in what manner it subsists: <lb/>
            the description therefore of the conception of genus, which <lb/>
            has been enunciated, contains nothing superfluous, nothing <lb/>
            deficient.1</p>
          <p>Species indeed is predicated of every form, ac­ <lb/>
            cording to which it is said, " form is first worthy <lb/>
            of imperial sway ;"2 still that is called species also, <lb/>
            which is under the genus stated, according to <lb/>
            which we are accustomed to call man a species of <lb/>
            animal, animal being genus, but white a species <lb/>
            10. Species pre­ <lb/>
            dicated of every <lb/>
            form, and un­ <lb/>
            der genus. Cf. <lb/>

            Log. lib. ii.; <lb/>
            Aldrich and <lb/>
            Hill <lb/>
            of colour, and triangle of figure. Nevertheless, if when we <lb/>
            assign the genus, we make mention of species, saying that <lb/>
            which is predicated of many things differing in species, in <lb/>
            reply to what a thing is, and call species that which is under <lb/>
            the assigned genus, we ought to know that, since genus is the <lb/>
            genus of something, and species the species of something, each <lb/>
            of each, we must necessarily use both in the definitions of <lb/>
            both. They assign, therefore, species thus: species is what <lb/>
            is arranged under genus, and of which genus is predicated in <lb/>
            reply to what a thing is: moreover, thus species <lb/>
            is what is predicated of many things differing in <lb/>
            number, in reply to what a thing is. This ex­ <lb/>
            planation, however, belongs to the most special, <lb/>
            11. The latter <lb/>
            predicated of <lb/>
            the former “in <lb/>

            and “quale,” (cf. Aldrich, Abelard de Gen. et Spe. ed. Cousin,) but <lb/>

            other (descriptions) will pertain to such as are not the most <lb/>
            special. Now, what we have stated will be evident in this <lb/>
            way: in each category there are certain things most generic, <lb/>
            and again, others most special, and between the most generic <lb/>
            and the most special, others which are alike called both <lb/>
            genera and species, but the most generic is that above which <lb/>
            there cannot be another superior genus, and the most special <lb/>
            that below which there cannot be another inferior species.</p>

            between sum-. <lb/>

            and infima <lb/>

            p. 59, and Aid­ <lb/>

          <p>Between the most generic and the most special, <lb/>
            there are others which are alike both genera and <lb/>
            species, referred, nevertheless, to different things, <lb/>
            but what is stated may become clear in one cate­ <lb/>
            gory. Substance indeed, is itself genus, under <lb/>
            this is body, under body animated body, under <lb/>
            which is animal, under animal rational animal, <lb/>
            under which is man, under man Socrates, Plato, <lb/>
            and men particularly. Still, of these, substance is the most <lb/>
            generic, and that which alone is genus; but man is most spe­ <lb/>
            cific, and that which alone is species; yet body is a species <lb/>
            of substance, but a genus of animated body, also animated <lb/>
            body is a species of body, but a genus of animal; again, <lb/>
            animal is a species of animated body, but a genus of rational <lb/>
            animal, and rational animal is a species of animal, but a genus <lb/>
            of man, and man is a species of rational animal, but is no <lb/>
            longer the genus of particular men, but is species only, and <lb/>
            every thing prior to individuals being proximately predicated <lb/>
            of them, will be species only, and no longer genus also. As <lb/>
            then, substance being in the highest place, is most generic, <lb/>
            from there being no genus prior to it, so also man being a <lb/>
            species, after which there is no other species, nor any thing <lb/>
            capable of division into species, but individuals, (for Socrates, <lb/>
            Plato, Alcibiades, and this white thing, I call individual,) will <lb/>
            be species alone, and the last species, and as we say the most <lb/>
            13. Subalterns <lb/>
            are species to <lb/>
            the terms high­ <lb/>
            er, but are ge­ <lb/>
            nera to those <lb/>
            lower than <lb/>
            specific. Yet the media will be the species of <lb/>
            such as are before them, but the genera of things <lb/>
            after them, so that these have two conditions, one <lb/>
            as to things prior to them, according to which they <lb/>
            are said to be their species, the other to things after <note type="footnote"> 1 An infima species can be maintained by none consistently but a <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. II.]"/>them, according to which they are said to be their <lb/>
            genera. The extremes on the other hand, have <lb/>
            one condition, for the most generic has indeed a <lb/>
            themselves. <lb/>

            condition as to the things under it, since it is the highest <lb/>
            genus of all, but has no longer one as to those before it, be­ <lb/>
            ing supreme, and the first principle, and, as we have said, that <lb/>
            above which there cannot be another higher genus. Also, the <lb/>
            most specific has one condition, as to the things prior to it, of <lb/>
            which it is the species, yet it has not a different one, as to <lb/>
            things posterior to it, but is called the species of individuals, <lb/>
            so termed as comprehending them, and again, the species of <lb/>
            things prior to it, as comprehended by them, wherefore the <lb/>
            most generic genus is thus defined to be that which <lb/>
            being genus is not species, and again, above which <lb/>
            there cannot be another higher genus; but the most <lb/>
            specific species, that, which being species is not <lb/>
            genus, and which being species we can no longer <lb/>
            divide into species; moreover, which is predicated <lb/>

            to the most specific, ascending up to the most generic, are <lb/>
            called subaltern genera and species. Thus, Agamemnon is <lb/>
            Atrides, Pelopides, Tantalides, and lastly, (the son) of Jupiter, <lb/>
            yet in genealogies they refer generally to one origin, for in­ <lb/>
            stance, to Jupiter; but this is not the case in genera and spe­ <lb/>
            cies, since being is not the common genus of all things, nor, as <lb/>
            Aristotle says, are all things of the same genus with respect <lb/>
            to one summum genus. Still, let the first ten genera be ar­ <lb/>
            ranged, as in the Categories, as ten first principles, and even <lb/>
            if a person should call all things beings, yet he will call them, <lb/>
            so he says, equivocally, but not synonymously, for if being <lb/>
            were the one common genus of all things, all things would be <lb/>
            synonymously styled beings, but the first principles being <lb/>
            ten, the community is in name only, yet not in the definition <note type="footnote"> I For the exemplification of the above, see the " Arbor Porphyriana:'' <lb/>

            come down to the most specific from the most <lb/>

            so ; but particulars and singulars, on the contrary, <lb/>
            always divide the one into multitude, for by the <lb/>
            participation of species, many men become one <lb/>
            man; but in particulars and singulars, the one, <lb/>
            and what is common, becomes many; for the singular is <lb/>
            always divisive, but what is common is collective and reduc­ <lb/>

          <p>Genus then, and species, being each of them <lb/>
            explained as to what it is, since also genus is one, <lb/>
            but species many, (for there is always a division <lb/>
            of genus into many species,) genus indeed is al­ <lb/>
            ways predicated of species, and all superior of in­ <lb/>
            ferior, but species is neither predicated of its <lb/>
            proximate genus, nor of those superior, since it <lb/>
            does not reciprocate. For it is necessary that either equals <lb/>
            should be predicated of equals, as neighing of a horse, or that <lb/>
            the greater should be predicated of the less, as animal of man, <lb/>
            but the less no longer of the greater, for you can no longer <lb/>
            say that animal is man, as you can say that man is animal. <lb/>
            Of those things however whereof species is predicated, that <note type="footnote"> 1 See notes to pp. 6 and 8, Caterer. An infima species implies a no­ <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. II.]"/>genus of the species will also be necessarily predicated, also that <lb/>
            genus of the genus up to the most generic; for if it is true to <lb/>
            any that Socrates is a man, but man an animal, and animal <lb/>
            substance, it is also true to say that Socrates is animal and <lb/>
            substance. At least, since the superior are always predicated <lb/>
            of the inferior, species indeed will always be predicated of the <lb/>
            individual, but the genus both of the species and of the indi­ <lb/>
            vidual, but the most generic both of the genus or the genera, <lb/>
            (if the media and subaltern be many,) and of the species, and <lb/>
            of the individual. For the most generic is predicated of all <lb/>
            the genera, species, and individuals under it, but the genus <lb/>
            which is prior to the most specific (species), is predicated of <lb/>
            all the most specific species and individuals; but what is spe­ <lb/>
            cies alone of all the individuals (of it), but the individual of <lb/>
            one particular alone.1 Now, an individual is called Socrates, <lb/>
            this white thing, this man who approaches the son of Sophro­ <lb/>
            niscus, if Socrates alone is his son, and such things are called <lb/>
            individuals, because each consists of properties of which the <lb/>
            combination can never be the same in any other, for the pro­ <lb/>
            perties of Socrates can never be the same in any other par­ <lb/>
            ticular person; ;2 the properties of man indeed, (I mean of him <lb/>
            as common, may be the same in many, or rather in all par­ <lb/>
            ticular men, so far as they are men. Wherefore <lb/>
            the individual is comprehended in the species, but <lb/>
            the species by the genus, for genus is a certain <lb/>
            whole, but the individual is a part, and species <lb/>
            19. Genus a <lb/>
            certain whole, <lb/>
            individual a <lb/>
            part: species a <lb/>
            whole and a <note type="footnote"> 1 Properly speaking, there cannot be more than one highest genus, <lb/>
            which is a cognate term to every substance and quality supposed to exist; <lb/>

            Species, when resolved into its component parts, is found to be combined <lb/>
            of genus and difference, and in different points of view, may be referred <lb/>
            to different genera, also many species have no appropriate name, but are <lb/>
            expressed by the combination of their constituent parts, genus and differ­ <lb/>

            Cf. ch. 3, Cat. note ; Crakantliorpe, Log. lib. ii. Any singular term (de­ <lb/>

            whole of what is understood by the species it belongs to, but also more, <lb/>
            namely, whatever distinguishes that single object from others of the same <lb/>

            also all that distinguishes that individual city. Cf. Wallis, ch. 2. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Hence, in describing an individual, we do not employ properties <lb/>

            predicated <lb/>
            commonly,pro­ <lb/>
            perly, and most <lb/>
            properly. Cf. <lb/>
            Whately, Man­ <unclear/> <lb/>
            el, and Wallis.</p>
          <p>DIFFERENCE may be predicated commonly, pro­ <lb/>
            perly, and most properly: for one thing is said to <lb/>
            differ from another in common from its differing <lb/>
            in some respect in diversity of nature, either from <lb/>
            itself, or from something else ; for Socrates differs <lb/>
            from Plato in diversity of nature, and himself <lb/>
            from himself when a boy, and when become a man, also when <lb/>
            he does any thing, or ceases to do it, and it is always perceived <lb/>
            in the different ways in which a thing is somehow effected. <lb/>
            Again, one thing is said to differ properly from another, when <lb/>
            one differs from another by an inseparable accident; but an <lb/>
            inseparable accident is such as blueness, or crookedness, or a <lb/>
            scar become scirrhous from a wound. Moreover, one is most <lb/>
            properly said to differ from another, when it varies by spe­ <lb/>
            cific difference, as man differs from horse by specific differ- <lb/>
            2. Every differ­ <lb/>
            ence is effective <lb/>
            of diversity­ <lb/>
            the common <lb/>
            and proper ren­ <lb/>
            der a thing <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλλοῑον</foreign>(alie­ <lb/>
            num), the most <lb/>
            ence, i. e. by the quality of rational. Universally <lb/>
            then every difference acceding to a thing renders it <lb/>
            different, but differences common and proper ren­ <lb/>
            der it different in quality, and the most proper <lb/>
            render it another thing. Hence, those which ren­ <lb/>
            der it another thing are called specific, but those, <note type="footnote"> I Genus is a whole in predication, containing under it various sub­ <lb/>
            jective species; species is a whole in definition, containing genus and dif­ <lb/>
            ferentia, as parts of the essence; the former may be called " Totum <lb/>
            Universale," the latter "Totum Essentiale," (cf. Crakanthorpe, Logica, <lb/>
            lib. ii. ch. 5): sometimes the distinction is expressed by the terms, <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. III.]"/>which make it different in quality, are simply <lb/>
            (called) differences, for the difference of rational <lb/>
            being added to animal, makes it another thing, <lb/>
            proper render it <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὰλλο</foreign>(aliud); <lb/>
            this last kind Is <lb/>
            called specific. <lb/>
            (and makes a species of animal, but difference of being moved <lb/>
            makes it different in quality only from what is at rest, so that <lb/>
            the one renders it another thing, but the other only of another <lb/>
            quality.1</p>
          <p>According then, to the differences which pro­ <lb/>
            duce another thing do the divisions of genera into <lb/>
            species arise, and the definitions arising from <lb/>
            genus and such differences are assigned. On the <lb/>
            3. Specific dif­ <lb/>
            ferences divide <lb/>
            genus into spe­ <lb/>
            cies. <lb/>
            other hand, as to those which only make a thing different in <lb/>
            quality, diversities alone consist, and the changes of subsist- <lb/>
            tence of a thing; beginning then, again, from the <lb/>
            first, we must say that of differences some are <lb/>
            separable, others inseparable, thus to be moved, <lb/>
            and to be at rest, to be ill, and to be well, and <lb/>
            such as resemble these, are separable, but to have <lb/>
            a crooked, or a flat nose, to be rational, or irra­ <lb/>
            tional, are inseparable differences. Again, of the <lb/>
            inseparable, some exist per se, others by accident, <lb/>
            4. Differences <lb/>
            divided into <lb/>
            separable and <lb/>
            inseparable; <lb/>
            these last sub. <lb/>
            divided into <lb/>
            those "per se,** <lb/>
            and those " per <lb/>
            accidens." Vide <lb/>
            Whately and <lb/>
            Mangel. <lb/>
            for rational, mortal, to be susceptible of science, are inherent <lb/>
            in man per se, but to have a crooked or flat nose, accidentally, <lb/>
            and not per see Wherefore, such as are present <lb/>
            per se, are assumed in the definition of substance, <lb/>
            and effect a different thing, but what are acci­ <lb/>
            dental are neither taken in the definition of sub­ <lb/>
            stance, nor render a thing another, but of another <lb/>
            quality. Those too, which are per Be, do not <lb/>
            admit of the more and less, but the accidental, <lb/>
            5. Differences <lb/>
            " per se <unclear/> as­ <lb/>
            sumed for de­ <lb/>

            even if they be inseparable, admit of intention and remission, <note type="footnote"> 1 According to Porphyry, difference is always predicated " de specie <lb/>
            differentibus," and he recognises only a relative difference between two <lb/>
            given species; thus " rational" is not the difference of man per se, but <lb/>
            of man as distinguished from brutes. Specific difference (<foreign xml:lang="grc">διαφορὰεἰξο­ <lb/>
            ποίος</foreign>)is opposed by him to accidental difference, (<foreign xml:lang="grc">διαφορὰκατὰσυμ­ <lb/>
            βεβηκός</foreign>,)and marks the difference proper, which distinguishes species <lb/>
            from species, (whether subaltern or infima,) as contrasted with accidental, <lb/>
            which only distinguishes between individuals. We must distinguish, how. <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[CHAP. III."/>for neither is genus more and less predicated of that of which <lb/>
            it is the genus, nor the differences of genus according to <lb/>
            which it is divided. For these are such as complete the de­ <lb/>
            finition of each thing, but the essence of each is one and the <lb/>
            same, and neither admits of intention, nor remission ; to have <lb/>
            however a crooked or a flat nose, or to be in some way <lb/>
            coloured, admits both of intension and remission. Since then, <lb/>

            sensitive, rational and irrational, mortal and immortal, the <lb/>
            difference of animated and sensitive is constitutive of the <lb/>
            essence of animal, for animal is an animated substance, en­ <lb/>
            dued with sense, but the difference of mortal and immortal, <lb/>
            and that of rational and irrational, are the divisive differences <lb/>
            of animal, for through these we divide genera into species: <lb/>
            yet these very differences which divide the genera are con­ <lb/>
            stitutive and completive of species. For animal is divided by <lb/>
            the difference of rational and irrational, and again, by the dif­ <lb/>
            ference of mortal and immortal; but the differences of rational <lb/>
            and mortal are constitutive of man, but those of rational and <lb/>
            immortal of God, those again, of mortal and irrational, of <lb/>
            irrational animals.1 Thus also, since the differences of animate <lb/>

            (since whence would species have differences ?) nor has it all <lb/>
            the opposite differences, (since otherwise the same thing would <lb/>

            subsist about the same thing.</p>
          <p>Again, they define it (difference) also thus: <lb/>

            mortal being predicated of man, are spoken in reply to what <lb/>
            kind of thing man is, and not as to the question what is he. <lb/>
            For when we are asked what is man, we properly answer, an <lb/>
            animal, but when men inquire what kind of animal, we say <lb/>
            properly, that he is rational and mortal. For since things <lb/>
            consist of matter and form, or have a constitution analogous to <lb/>
            matter and form, as a statue is composed of brass, matter, but <lb/>
            of figure, form, so also man, both common and specific, con­ <lb/>

            are useless in definition, (vide Opera, p. 3,) accidental definition is, in <lb/>

            proper definition is by genus and differentiæ, hence all definable notions <lb/>
            will be species. The definition here given of difference, as to its being <lb/>

            and horse, which are under the same genus, ani­ <lb/>
            mal. Again, they give it in this way: difference <lb/>
            is that by which each singular thing differs, for <lb/>
            man and horse do not differ as to genus, for both we and <lb/>
            horses are animals, but the addition of rational separates us <lb/>
            from them; again, both we and the gods1 are rational, but <lb/>

            and 13. <lb/>
            the addition of mortal separates us from them. <lb/>
            They however who more nicely discuss what per­ <lb/>
            tains to difference, say that it is not any casual <lb/>
            thing dividing those under the same genus, but <lb/>
            such as contributes to the essence, and to the definition of the <lb/>
            essence of a thing, and which is part of the thing. For to be <lb/>
            naturally adapted to sail is not the difference, though it is <lb/>
            the property of man, since we may say that of animals, some <lb/>
            are naturally adapted to sail, but others not,, separating man <lb/>
            from other animals; yet a natural ability to sail does not <lb/>
            complete the essence, neither is a part of it, but only an apti­ <lb/>
            tude of it, because it is not such a difference as those which <lb/>
            are called specific differences. Wherefore specific differences <lb/>
            will be such as produce another species, and which are as­ <lb/>

            to the highest species of which it is predicable, as to all subordinate species <lb/>
            it must be considered an accident, e. g. " mobile," a property of " corpus," <lb/>

            genus, species, difference, property, accident, we <lb/>
            must declare what things are common, and what <lb/>
            peculiar to them. Now it is common to them all <lb/>
            to be predicated, as we have said, of many things, <lb/>
            but genus (is predicated) of the species and indi­ <lb/>
            viduals under it, and difference in like manner; <lb/>
            but species, of the individuals under it; and property, both of <lb/>
            the species, of which it is the property, and of the individuals <lb/>
            under that species; again, accident (is predicated) both of <lb/>
            species, and individuals. For animal is predicated of horse <lb/>
            and ox, being species, also of this particular horse and ox, <lb/>
            which are individuals, but irrational is predicated of horse <lb/>

            of which it is the property, and of the individuals under that <lb/>

            blackness of the species of crows, and of particulars, being <lb/>
            an inseparable accident; and to be moved, of man and horse, <lb/>
            being a separable accident. Notwithstanding, it is pre-emi­ <lb/>

            tional, as animal does, yet it comprehends man <lb/>
            but not to an <lb/>
            equal extent. <lb/>
            and divinity, which are species. Whatever things also are <lb/>
            predicated of genus as genus, are predicated of the spe­ <lb/>
            cies under it, and whatever are predicated of difference as <lb/>
            difference, will be also of the species formed from it. For <lb/>
            animal being a genus, substance is predicated of it as of a <lb/>
            genus, also animated, and sensible, but these are predicated <lb/>
            of all the species under animal, as far as to individuals. As <lb/>
            moreover, rational is difference, the use of reason is predicated <lb/>
            of it, as of difference, yet the use of reason will not be predi­ <lb/>
            cated of rational only, but also of the species under rational. <lb/>
            This too is common, that when genus or differ­ <lb/>
            ence is subverted, the things under them are also <lb/>
            subverted, for as when animal is not, horse is not, <lb/>
            nor man, thus also, when rational is not, there <lb/>
            will be no animal which uses reason. Now, it is <lb/>
            the property of genus to be predicated of more <lb/>
            2. Either being <lb/>
            subverted co- <lb/>
            subverts its <lb/>
            subject; but <lb/>
            genus is predi­ <lb/>
            cated of more <lb/>
            than the other <lb/>
            predicables. <lb/>
            things than difference, species, property, and accident are, for <lb/>
            animal (is predicated) of man and horse, bird and snake, but <lb/>
            quadruped of animals alone, which have four feet; again, man <lb/>
            of individuals alone, and capacity of neighing of horse alone, <lb/>
            and of particulars. Likewise, accident of fewer things: yet <lb/>
            we must assume the differences by which the genus is di­ <lb/>
            vided, not those which complete, but which divide the essence <lb/>
            of genus.</p>
          <p>Moreover, genus comprehends difference in ca­ <lb/>
            pacity,1 for of animal one kind is rational, but <lb/>
            another irrational, but differences do not com­ <lb/>

            first necessarily exist, afterwards be divided by differences <lb/>

            property. Besides property is reciprocally predicated of that <lb/>

            it a man, nor if a thing be animal is it risible, but if any thing <lb/>
            is a man it is risible, and vice versa. Moreover, property is <lb/>
            inherent in the whole species, of which it is the property, in <lb/>

            genera being subverted, co-subvert species, to which proper­ <lb/>

            primarily subsist about individuals, but genera and species are <lb/>
            by nature prior to individual substances. Moreover, genera <lb/>
            are predicated of the things under them, in respect to what a <lb/>
            thing is, but accidents in respect to what kind of a thing it is, <lb/>

            It is also common always to be present to their <lb/>

            but in as far as differences according to genus constitute him.1 <lb/>
            Besides, difference is often seen in many species, as quadruped <lb/>
            in many animals, different in species, but species is in the in­ <lb/>

            perty, to be reciprocally predicated of each other, <lb/>
            since if any thing be man, it is risible, also if it <lb/>
            be risible, it is man, still we have frequently de­ <lb/>
            clared that risible must be assumed according to <lb/>
            natural adaptation to risibility. It is also common <lb/>

            sent to their participants, and properties to the things of <lb/>
            which they are properties, but species differs from property, <lb/>
            in that species indeed may be the genus of other things, but <lb/>
            property cannot possibly be the property of other things. <lb/>
            Again, species subsists prior to property, but property accedes <lb/>
            to species, for man must exist, in order that risible may: be­ <lb/>
            sides, species is always present in energy with its subject, but <lb/>
            property sometimes also in capacity, for Socrates is a man <lb/>
            always in energy, but he does not always laugh, though he is <lb/>
            always naturally adapted to be risible.1 Once more, things of <note type="footnote"> 1 Upon the distinction between <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνεργεία</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">δυνάμις</foreign>, vide note ch. 13. <lb/>

            and Wallis <lb/>
            (Logics).</p>
          <p>To species and accident it is common to be predi­ <lb/>
            cated of many, but other points of community are <lb/>
            rare, from the circumstance of accident, and that <lb/>
            to which it is accidental, differing very much from <lb/>
            each other. Now, the properties of each are <lb/>
            these: of species, to be predicated of those of <lb/>
            which it is the species, in respect to what a thing <lb/>
            is, but of accident, in reference to what kind a <lb/>
            thing is of, or how it subsists.2 Likewise, that <lb/>
            each substance partakes of one species, but of many accidents, <lb/>
            both separable and inseparable: moreover, species are con­ <lb/>
            ceived prior to accidents, even if they be inseparable, (for <lb/>
            there must be subject, in order that something should happen <lb/>
            to it,) but accidents are naturally adapted to be of posterior <lb/>
            origin, and possess a nature adjunctive to substance. Again, <lb/>
            of species the participation is equal, but of accident, even if <lb/>
            it be inseparable, it is not equal; for an Ethiopian may have <lb/>
            a colour intense, or remitted, according to blackness, with <lb/>

            property and inseparable accident not to subsist <lb/>
            without those things in which they are beheld, <lb/>
            for as man does not subsist without risible,1 so <lb/>
            subsist without <lb/>
            their subjects: <lb/>
            their distinc­ <lb/>
            tions respect­ <lb/>
            ively. <lb/>
            neither can Ethiopian subsist without blackness, and as pro­ <lb/>
            perty is present to every, and always, so also is inseparable <lb/>
            accident. Nevertheless, they differ, in that property is pre­ <lb/>
            sent to one species alone, as the being risible to man, but in­ <lb/>
            separable accident, as black, is present not only to an Ethiopian, <lb/>
            but also to a crow, to a coal, to ebony, and to certain other <lb/>
            things. Moreover, property is reciprocally predicated of that <lb/>
            of which it is the property, and is equally (present), but in­ <lb/>
            separable accident is not reciprocally predicated, besides, the <lb/>
            participation of properties is equal, but of accidents one (sub­ <lb/>
            ject partakes) more, but another less. There are indeed other <lb/>

          <p>INTRODUCTORy.-It being the intention of Aristotle to lay <lb/>
            down a system by which truth and certainty, in respect of <lb/>
            human knowledge, might be ascertained, the term " Organon," <lb/>
            though not sanctioned by himself, appears not inapplicable to <lb/>
            this collection of treatises constituting an instrument, for the <lb/>
            accurate verbal enunciation of all mental conceptions what­ <lb/>
            soever. Regarding language as the vehicle of thought, he <lb/>
            commences his subject by discussing primary words, so far <lb/>
            as they are significant of things ; understanding by “Cate­ <lb/>
            gories," the most extensive genera of what the simple word <lb/>
            expresses. Properly the appellation signifies accusations per­ <lb/>
            taining to judicial processes, but as Porphyry remarks, that <lb/>
            "to treat of things publicly, according to any signification, <lb/>
            in short, to assert any word of a thing, is to predicate," the <lb/>
            word " Categories or " Predicaments," is applied to such <lb/>
            terms as are always adapted to predication. They were held <lb/>
            to be the most universal expressions for the various relations <lb/>
            of things, as classes under some of which every thing might <lb/>
            be reduced, and of these he enumerates ten, not assigning <lb/>
            any reason for the number, neither pretending that the classi­ <lb/>
            fication is complete, though it appears to have been considered <lb/>
            satisfactory, until Kant ventured on another. Moreover, as <lb/>
            truth and falsehood consist in a combination of words or <lb/>
            ideas, to analyze the various processes of the mind, and to ex­ <lb/>
            hibit logic, both as the art of thinking, and the science of <lb/>
            affirmation, were the objects of these treatises; their spirit <lb/>
             <pb n="635"/>
            runs through the whole Aristotelian philosophy, and espe­ <lb/>
            cially elucidated here, has made his logic prized above all his <lb/>
            other works.</p>
          <p>Prior to inquiry into the connexion of subject and predi­ <lb/>
            cate, hf investigates the first element of thought, the simple <lb/>
            word, treats of the materials of incomplex and complex ap­ <lb/>
            prehension, and explains the nature of homonyms, synonyms, <lb/>
            and paronyms, so as to prepare the reader by what was neces­ <lb/>
            sary to the doctrine of the Categories, for their subsequent <lb/>
            consecutive analysis, without digression. For as geometricians <lb/>
            first adduce axioms, definitions, and postulates, so such ante­ <lb/>
            cedent inquiry is necessary to the logical division of things <lb/>
            and their attributes, as well as to the exposition of the affirma­ <lb/>
            tive and negative sentence, taught in the treatise on Inter­ <lb/>
            pretation ; afterwards we proceed to the syllogism and demon­ <lb/>
            stration contained in the Prior and Posterior Analytics.</p>
          <p>CHAP. I.—1. Homonyms are things of which the name is <lb/>
            common, but the definition of substance, according to the <lb/>
            name, is different; they answer to equivocal words.</p>
          <p>2. Synonyms have both the name common, and the de­ <lb/>
            finition the same, corresponding to univocal.</p>
          <p>3. Paronyms differ in case, yet take their nominal ap­ <lb/>
            pellation from something, they are equivalent to deriva­ <lb/>
            tives.</p>
          <p>CHAP. II.—1. Subjects of discourse are complex and incom­ <lb/>
            plex.</p>
          <p>2. Moreover, some things are predicated of, yet are in <lb/>
            no subject.</p>
          <p>3. Others are in, yet are not predicated of a subject. By <lb/>
            being in a subject, Aristotle means that which is in any <lb/>
            thing, not as a part, but which cannot subsist without that <lb/>
            in which it is.</p>
          <p>4. Others are both predicated of, and are in a subject.</p>
          <p>5. Lastly, some are neither in, nor are predicated of any <lb/>
            subject.</p>
          <p>6. Individuals are predicated of no subject, though they <lb/>
            may be in it.</p>
          <p>CHAP. III.—1. Whatever is said of the predicate may be said <lb/>
            of the subject of which it is predicated.</p><pb n="636"/>
            
          <p>2. The differences of different genera are diverse in <lb/>
            species.</p>
          <p>3. Of subaltern genera, the differences may be the same.</p>
          <p>CHAP. IV.—1. The Categories are: <lb/>
            Substance. <lb/>
            Quantity. <lb/>
            Quality. <lb/>
            Relation. <lb/>
            Where. <lb/>
            When. <lb/>
            Position. <lb/>
            Possession. <lb/>
            Action. I <lb/>
            Passion.</p>
          <p>2. The above, by themselves, are neither affirmative nor <lb/>
            negative.</p>
          <p>CHAP. V.—1. Primary substance is neither in, nor is predi­ <lb/>
            cated of any subject.</p>
          <p>2. Secondary substances contain the first.</p>
          <p>3. In predication the name and definition of the subject <lb/>
            must be predicated, though sometimes the name may be <lb/>
            predicated of the subject, when the definition cannot be.</p>
          <p>4. The universal involves the particular.</p>
          <p>5. Of secondary substances, species is more substance <lb/>
            than genus, because it is nearer to the primary substance.</p>
          <p>6. Primary substances, from their becoming subjects to <lb/>
            all predicates, are especially termed substances.</p>
          <p>7. Genus is a predicate of species, but species is not <lb/>
            reciprocally predicated of genus.</p>
          <p>8. Infimæ species concur in not being substance.</p>
          <p>9. After the first substances, of the rest, species and <lb/>
            genera alone, are termed secondary, from their declaring <lb/>
            the primary substances of the predicates.</p>
          <p>10. The same relation which primary substances bear to <lb/>
            all other things, do the species and genera of the primary <lb/>
            bear to all the rest.</p>
          <p>11. No substance is in a subject.</p>
          <p>12. Of inhesives, the name, but not the definition, may <lb/>
            be predicated of the subject: of secondary substances, both <lb/>
            the definition and the name are predicated of the subject.</p>
          <p>13. Difference concurs with substance, in not existing in <lb/>
            the subject.</p>
          <p>14. Parts of substances are also substances.</p>
          <p>15. Both of substances and differences the predication is <lb/>
            univocal.</p><pb n="637"/>
            
          <p>16. Every substance signifies this particular thing.</p>
          <p>17. Secondary substances however signify a certain <lb/>
            “quale.”</p>
          <p>18. The species and genus determine the quality about <lb/>
            the substance, though genus is of wider extension than <lb/>
            species.</p>
          <p>19. It is proved by many instances that substance and <lb/>
            quantity admit no contrary, neither the greater nor less.</p>
          <p>20. Individually substance can receive contraries, which <lb/>
            non-substances cannot, and any objection made to this state­ <lb/>
            ment is refuted by proving a difference in the mode.</p>
          <p>21. When things inherent in substances are changed, <lb/>
            they are capable of contrariety, yet in the case of sentence <lb/>
            and opinion, they are not capable of contraries, from having <lb/>
            received any thing, but in that about something else, a <lb/>
            passive quality has been produced.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VI.—1. Quantity is of two kinds, one discrete, the <lb/>
            other continuous; the former consists of parts having no <lb/>
            position with respect to each other; the latter of parts <lb/>
            having such position. The examples of discrete quantity <lb/>
            are number, and a sentence; of continuous quantity, are <lb/>
            superficies, body, time, and place.</p>
          <p>2. The above are the only proper quantities, all others <lb/>
            are so denominated, merely by accident, and with reference <lb/>
            to these.</p>
          <p>3. Quantity "per se" has no contrary, since there is <lb/>
            nothing, for example, contrary to superficies, but if a per­ <lb/>
            son object that " much ” is contrary to " little," it may be <lb/>
            replied that a thing is so called in reference to something <lb/>
            else, wherefore such terms rather belong to relatives: also <lb/>
            if " great" and " small" be contraries, the same thing will <lb/>
            at the same time receive contraries, and the same things <lb/>
            be contrary to themselves.</p>
          <p>4. Nothing, except substance, appears to receive con­ <lb/>
            traries simultaneously.</p>
          <p>5. The contrariety of quantity subsists especially about <lb/>
            place, as “ upward" is contrary to " downward," and con­ <lb/>
            traries are defined to be those things, which being of the <lb/>
            same genus, are most distant from each other.</p>
          <p>6. Quantity is incapable of degree, e. g. "three" or <lb/>
             <pb n="638"/>
            “five” are not said to be more than “three” or ”five,” <lb/>
            neither “five” more “five” than “three,” “three.”</p>
          <p>7. Quantity is especially characterized by equality and <lb/>
            inequality; whatever are not quantities, being rather termed <lb/>
            similar and dissimilar.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VII.—1. Relatives are so defined from being such things <lb/>
            as belong to others, or may in some way be referred to <lb/>
            something else, e. g. " the double " and " the greater."</p>
          <p>2. Of the number of relatives, are habit, disposition, <lb/>
            sense, knowledge, position.</p>
          <p>3. Contrariety is not inherent in all relatives, but they <lb/>
            admit degree in some cases.</p>
          <p>4. Relatives are styled so by reciprocity, e. g. servant <lb/>
            and master.</p>
          <p>5. An exception occurs to this, if that be not appropri­ <lb/>
            ately attributed to which relation is made.</p>
          <p>6. A name must sometimes be invented for that to which <lb/>
            the reference may be properly applied.</p>
          <p>7. A person may however assume things to which names <lb/>
            are not given, if from the primary he assigns names to <lb/>
            those others with which they reciprocate.</p>
          <p>8. All proper relatives reciprocate, since if they refer to <lb/>
            something casual, and are not properly attributed to what <lb/>
            they relate, they will not reciprocate.</p>
          <p>9. By nature relatives are simultaneous, with some ex­ <lb/>
            ceptions.</p>
          <p>10. The object of science being subverted co-subverts <lb/>
            the science, but this is not true vice versa, since the object <lb/>
            of science may exist when science does not exist. In car­ <lb/>
            rying out this example, he shows that the sensible being <lb/>
            subverted, body which is of the number of sensibles, is sub­ <lb/>
            verted, but sense does not co-subvert the sensible.</p>
          <p>11. Primary substances have no relation, either wholly <lb/>
            or partially; but in the case of some secondary substances, <lb/>
            there is a doubt whether they do really or apparently pos­ <lb/>
            sess it.</p>
          <p>12. One relative being known, the co-relative can be <lb/>
            known also; but in secondary substances this does not fol­ <lb/>
            low, whence the latter appear not to be relatives, neverthe­ <lb/>
            less, a determinate statement upon such is difficult.</p><pb n="639"/>
            
          <p>CHAP. VIII.—1. Quality is defined that, according to which <lb/>
            certain things are said to be what they are: there are four <lb/>
            species of it, viz.</p>
          <p>1st, Habit and disposition: the former differs from the <lb/>
            latter in being more lasting, also the former is the latter <lb/>
            but the latter is not the former.</p>
          <p>2nd, That kind of quality which comprehends the facul­ <lb/>
            ties and natural powers.</p>
          <p>3rd, That which consists of the passions: this is proved <lb/>
            by the fact of their recipients being called "qualia" from <lb/>
            them. Colour moreover is excepted from this number, <lb/>
            and such things as are produced from what is easily dis­ <lb/>
            solved and quickly restored, are <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάθη</foreign> and not qualities: but <lb/>
            certain things supervening upon birth from passions difficult <lb/>
            of removal are comprehended in the latter Category.</p>
          <p>4th, Form and figure, and whatever resembles them. <lb/>
            These four are most commonly called qualities, although <lb/>
            there may appear some other mode.</p>
          <p>2. Qualia are things denominated derivatively from these, <lb/>
            although in some cases this is impossible, from no names <lb/>
            having been given to the qualities, or even when there is a <lb/>
            name, the "quale" is not derivatively denominated: this <lb/>
            latter instance however does not often occur.</p>
          <p>3. To quality, contrariety is incident, though not always, <lb/>
            e. g. in colours.</p>
          <p>4. If one contrary be a " quale," the other will also be one.</p>
          <p>5. Qualia also admit degree, but not always: form and <lb/>
            figure, for instance, are incapable of it.</p>
          <p>6. It is the property of quality that similitude is predi­ <lb/>
            cated in respect of it.</p>
          <p>7. It may be objected that in discussing quality, habits <lb/>
            and dispositions, which are reckoned as relatives, are in­ <lb/>
            cluded, but the reply is, that in all such things the genera <lb/>
            are called relatives, but not one of the singulars : hence too <lb/>
            singulars are not of the number of relatives, though we are <lb/>
            called "quales" from singulars.</p>
          <p>CHAP. IX.—1. Action and passion admit both contrariety and <lb/>
            degree; of the other categories, nothing additional is men­ <lb/>
            tioned to what was stated at first, because they are evident.</p>
          <p>CHAP. X.—1. Opposition takes place in four ways; as rela­ <lb/>
             <pb n="640"/>
            tive, contrary, privation and habit, affirmation and nega­ <lb/>
            tion.</p>
          <p>2. Relative opposition is so denominated, with reference <lb/>
            to opposites, e. g. knowledge, to the object of knowledge.</p>
          <p>3. Contrary opposition is that which is by no means in­ <lb/>
            cident to relatives: some contraries have something inter­ <lb/>
            mediate, others have not, and in some instances the inter­ <lb/>
            mediates have names, e. g. certain mixed colours.</p>
          <p>4. The opposition of privation and habit is predicated of <lb/>
            something identical, and universally of what the habit is <lb/>
            naturally adapted to be produced in.</p>
          <p>5. To be deprived of, and to possess habit, however, are <lb/>
            not privation and habit: but the two former appear to be <lb/>
            similarly opposed as the two latter.</p>
          <p>6. The above remark applies also to the opposition of <lb/>
            affirmative and negative.</p>
          <p>7. Returning to privation and habit, he proves that they <lb/>
            are not relatively opposed, nor contrarily, since relatives are <lb/>
            referred to reciprocals, and neither privation nor habit need <lb/>
            always be inherent in what is capable of either. Moreover, <lb/>
            they are not included amongst such as have any intermedi­ <lb/>
            ate, and in contraries a change into each other may happen, <lb/>
            unless one is naturally inherent; but though a change may <lb/>
            take place from habit to privation, vice versâ it is impos­ <lb/>
            sible.</p>
          <p>8. The peculiarity of affirmative and negative opposition <lb/>
            consists in one being true, and the other false, which, though <lb/>
            apparently, is not really nor always necessary to contraries <lb/>
            predicated conjunctively.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XI.—1. Though "evil" is opposed to "good," yet at <lb/>
            one time " good," and at another " evil," may be contrary to <lb/>
            “evil;” otherwise, generally “good” is contrary to "evil."</p>
          <p>2. Where one contrary exists, the other need not exist, <lb/>
            for sometimes one destroys the other.</p>
          <p>3. Nevertheless, contraries generally subsist about the <lb/>
            same thing in species or genus.</p>
          <p>4. Also they must be either in the same genus, or in <lb/>
            contrary genera, or be genera themselves.</p>
          <p>CHAT. XII.—1. Priority subsists in four respects, viz. either, <lb/>
            Ist, In regard to time.</p><pb n="641"/>
            
          <p>2nd, When there is no reciprocity as to the consequence <lb/>
            at existence.</p>
          <p>3rd, In respect of order.</p>
          <p>4th, As to excellence: this however is almost the most <lb/>
            foreign of all the modes.</p>
          <p>2. Another mode of priority may be added where one <lb/>
            thing is the cause of another existing.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XIII.—1. Things are properly called simultaneous <lb/>
            which are produced at the same time, and reciprocate, or, <lb/>
            which derived from the same genus, are by division mutu­ <lb/>
            ally opposed, i. e. those which subsist, according to the same <lb/>
            division, as “winged " to " pedestrian " and “aquatic."</p>
          <p>2. Things are naturally simultaneous, which reciprocate, <lb/>
            yet one is not effective of the other's existence.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XIV.— I. Motion possesses six species: generation, <lb/>
            corruption, increase, diminution, alteration, and change of <lb/>
            place.</p>
          <p>2. Although considered doubtful sometimes, yet it is <lb/>
            erroneous to suppose that what is altered, is so in respect <lb/>
            of some one of the other motions. It is proved different <lb/>
            from the other motions, 1st, By no increase or diminution <lb/>
            necessarily occurring to what is altered. 2nd, By no change <lb/>
            taking place in quality.</p>
          <p>3. Generic contrariety between the different motions, <lb/>
            corresponds to the specific contrariety.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XV.—1. "To have" is predicated, either, Ist, as qua­ <lb/>
            lity ; 2nd, quantity; 3rd, investiture; 4th, as in a part; <lb/>
            5th, as to a part; 6th, in measure; 7th, as possession ; it is <lb/>
            also predicated indirectly or by analogy.</p>

            <title type="sub">ON INTERPRETATION.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>INTRODucToRy.-From the view that a true or false thought <lb/>
            must be expressed by the union or separation of a subject and <lb/>
            a predicate, Aristotle in his treatise On Interpretation," con­ <lb/>
            siders the combination of the general term and the verb; <lb/>
            whence arises the proposition or <foreign xml:lang="grc">λόγος</foreign>. Although, there <note type="footnote"> 2 T </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="642"/>
            are many species of proposition, yet the enunciative alone in <lb/>
            its two kinds, affirmative and negative, admits the discovery <lb/>
            of truth or falsehood, and is therefore the subject of his especial <lb/>
            consideration. Again, contradiction arising from the mutual <lb/>
            opposition of the affirmative and negative, is discussed as con­ <lb/>
            stituting the principle of all subsequent demonstration, also <lb/>
            the nature of opposition generally, so as to admit fixed rules <lb/>
            for the true enunciation of thought in its relation to being, <lb/>
            whether possible or impossible, necessary or contingent. In <lb/>
            short, the design of the present treatise is to examine the first <lb/>
            composition of simple terms, subsisting according to the cate­ <lb/>
            goric form of the enunciative sentence, and, as here, he con­ <lb/>
            siders these terms as enunciations, so in his Analytics he <lb/>
            assumes them as parts of the syllogism itself. The sub­ <lb/>
            ject discussed may be divided into four sections; the first, <lb/>
            developing the principles of the enunciative sentence, by de­ <lb/>
            termining what the noun and verb, negation, affirmation, <lb/>
            enunciation, and a sentence are; the second, unfolding the <lb/>
            most simple proposition or enunciation from a subject and <lb/>
            predicate ; the third, expounding proposition as composed of <lb/>
            a subject, predicate, and something additional; and the fourth, <lb/>
            treating of proposition with a mode. The title on Interpreta­ <lb/>
            non seems to be applied as descriptive of language in its con­ <lb/>
            struction, being enunciative of the gnostic powers of the soul, <lb/>
            Aristotle considering that truth was only possible in combina­ <lb/>
            tion of words into a proposition, and that the truth of language <lb/>
            is invariably connected with the truth of being.</p>
          <p>CHAP. I.—1. Things enunciated by the voice are symbols of <lb/>
            the passions in the soul; these passions and the things of <lb/>
            which symbols are used are the same in all.</p>
          <p>2. Falsehood and truth are involved in composition and <lb/>
            division: the noun and verb of themselves resemble con­ <lb/>
            ception without composition and division.</p>
          <p>CHAP. II.—1. The noun is defined a sound significant by com­ <lb/>
            pact without time of which no part is separately significant: <lb/>
            it is according to compact, because naturally there is no <lb/>
            noun but when it becomes a symbol.</p>
          <p>2. The indefinite is not a noun, but is called so because <lb/>
            it exists alike in respect of entity and non-entity.</p><pb n="643"/>
            
          <p>3. Cases of the noun d'ffer from it in that being joined <lb/>
            to the copula, they signify neither truth nor falsehood.</p>
          <p>CHAP. III.—1. The verb is defined to be that which besides <lb/>
            something else signifies time, of which no part is separately <lb/>
            significant; also it is always indicative of those things which <lb/>
            are asserted of something else.</p>
          <p>2. A verb joined with negation is an indefinite and not <lb/>
            a proper logical verb, this also is true of other tenses, but <lb/>
            the present.</p>
          <p>3. Infinitives are properly nouns, and are insignificant, <lb/>
            except in composition.</p>
          <p>CHAP. IV.—1. A sentence is defined voice significant by com­ <lb/>
            pact, of which any part separately possesses signification as <lb/>
            a word, but not as affirmation or negation.</p>
          <p>2. Not every sentence is enunciative, but that in which <lb/>
            truth or falsehood is inherent.</p>
          <p>3. Other sentences dismissed as belonging more properly <lb/>
            to Rhetoric or Property, here the enunciative sentence alone <lb/>
            is considered.</p>
          <p>CHAP. V.—1. The first enunciative sentence is affirmation, <lb/>
            afterwards negation.</p>
          <p>2. Every enunciative sentence must be from a verb, or <lb/>
            its case.</p>
          <p>3. The enunciative sentence either signifies one thing, or <lb/>
            that which is one by conjunction.</p>
          <p>4. Of enunciations, one is simply affirmative or negative, <lb/>
            another is composed of these.</p>
          <p>5. Simple enunciation is defined to be voice significant of <lb/>
            something being inherent or non-inherent, according as <lb/>
            times are divided.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VI.—1. Affirmation is the enunciation of something con­ <lb/>
            cerning something, but negation is the enunciation of some­ <lb/>
            thing from something.</p>
          <p>2. We may enunciate what is, as though it were not, and <lb/>
            what is not, as though it were inherent; i. e. to all enun­ <lb/>
            ciation, truth or falsehood is incident.</p>
          <p>3. Affirmation may be denied, and vice versa; hence it <lb/>
            follows, that,</p>
          <p>4. To every affirmation there is an opposite negation, <lb/>
            and to every negation an opposite affirmation. <note type="footnote"> 2 T 2 </note></p><pb n="644"/>
            
          <p>5. Opposition between affirmative and negative, consti­ <lb/>
            tutes contradiction.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VII.—1. Universal is that which may naturally be pre­ <lb/>
            dicated of many things ; singular, that which may not.</p>
          <p>2. Contrariety is that which subsists between universal <lb/>
            affirmative and universal negative.</p>
          <p>3. No affirmative is true in which the universal is predi­ <lb/>
            cated of an universal predicate.</p>
          <p>4. Contradiction is between the universal affirmative and <lb/>
            the particular negative, or between the universal negative <lb/>
            and the particular affirmative.</p>
          <p>5. Contraries cannot at the same time be true, though <lb/>
            their opposites may.</p>
          <p>6. One negation is incident to each affirmation.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VIII.—1. What constitutes single affirmation and nega­ <lb/>
            tion is the unity of the subject and of the predicate, with­ <lb/>
            out equivocation.</p>
          <p>CHAP. IX.—1. In things present and past, affirmation and <lb/>
            negation must be true or false, in universals taken as such, <lb/>
            and in singulars; but in universals not universally enun­ <lb/>
            ciated, this is not necessary.</p>
          <p>2. Whatever true affirmation or negation is made of fu­ <lb/>
            tures, excludes casual existence.</p>
          <p>3. It cannot be truly affirmed that a thing will neither <lb/>
            be, nor not be.</p>
          <p>4. Whatever is generated, always so subsisted, as to have <lb/>
            been generated from necessity, so far as regards the predi­ <lb/>
            cation at any future time, being true or false.</p>
          <p>5. In things which do not always energize, there is <lb/>
            equally a power of being and of not being, so that many <lb/>
            things subsist casually, as to the nature of their affirmation <lb/>
            or negation.</p>
          <p>6. Being must necessarily be when it is, and non-being <lb/>
            not be when it is not; yet every being need not be, nor <lb/>
            every non-being not be; this reasoning is parallel as to <lb/>
            contradiction.</p>
          <p>CHAP. X.—1. As all affirmation and negation will be either <lb/>
            from a noun and verb, or from an indefinite noun and <lb/>
            verb; so without the verb, there is neither affirmation not <lb/>
            negation.</p><pb n="645"/>
            
          <p>2. With the addition of the copula, oppositions are enun­ <lb/>
            ciated doubly, wherefore there are four enunciations.</p>
          <p>3. There are also four others, if the affirmation be of a <lb/>
            noun taken universally, yet the diametrically opposed do <lb/>
            not happen to be co-verified.</p>
          <p>4. Opposites, as to indefinite nouns and verbs, are not <lb/>
            negations without a noun and verb.</p>
          <p>5. An indefinite is not a legitimate enunciation.</p>
          <p>6. When a noun and verb are transposed they have the <lb/>
            same signification, a., to affirmation and negation.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XI.—1. One thing cannot be said of many, nor many <lb/>
            of one, by one affirmation or negation.</p>
          <p>2. " What is it ?" is not a dialectic interrogation, because <lb/>
            it does not afford a choice to enunciate either part of con­ <lb/>
            tradiction.</p>
          <p>3. Disjunctions must not be assumed as conjunctively <lb/>
            true.</p>
          <p>4. In whatever categories contrariety is not inherent, if <lb/>
            definitions are essentially predicated, of these a particular <lb/>
            thing may be singly asserted with truth.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XII.—1. It is necessary to consider how the affirma­ <lb/>
            tions and negations of the "possible" and "impossible to <lb/>
            be, it of the contingent and the non-contingent, and of the <lb/>
            impossible and necessary, subsist.</p>
          <p>2. The reason that the same thing may both be and not <lb/>
            be, is that every thing which is thus possible does not al <lb/>
            ways energize.</p>
          <p>3. The negation of "It is possible to be," is "It is not <lb/>
            possible to be also of the contingent in like manner, and <lb/>
            of the necessary and the impossible.</p>
          <p>4. The negation of " It is possible not to be," is " It is not <lb/>
            possible not to be the two first follow each other; but the <lb/>
            two former and the two latter are never true at the same <lb/>
            time of the same thing.</p>
          <p>5. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἐιναι</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴ ἔιναι</foreign> must be considered as subjects <lb/>

            nected.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XIII.—1. The following is the proper method of dis­ <lb/>
            posing relative consequence: <pb n="646"/>
             </p>
          <p>1 <lb/>
            It is possible to be. <lb/>
            It may happen to be. <lb/>
            It is not impossible to be. <lb/>
            It is not necessary to be.</p>
          <p>2 <lb/>
            It is possible not to be. <lb/>
            It may happen not to be. <lb/>
            It is not impossible not to be. <lb/>
            It is not necessary not to be.</p>
          <p>3 <lb/>
            It is not possible to be. <lb/>
            It may not happen to be. <lb/>
            It is impossible to be. <lb/>
            It is necessary not to be.</p>
          <p>4 <lb/>
            It is not possible not to be. <lb/>
            It may happen not to be. <lb/>
            It is impossible not to be. <lb/>
            It is necessary to be.</p>
          <p>2. In the table above, the two former in each column <lb/>
            are contraries to the two former in the opposite, and the <lb/>
            two latter in each are contrary sequences from the two <lb/>
            former; but in necessary matter it is not thus, but contra­ <lb/>
            ries follow, and contradictories are placed separately.</p>
          <p>3. A distinction must be drawn between rational and <lb/>
            irrational potentiality, since not every thing which "can <lb/>
            be " is capable also of the opposite, hence,</p>
          <p>4. Rational powers are those of many things, and of the <lb/>
            contraries; but irrational are those which do not always <lb/>
            receive opposites.</p>
          <p>5. Some powers are equivocal: thus the possible is some­ <lb/>
            times predicated as being in energy, sometimes because it <lb/>
            may be in energy.</p>
          <p>6. The necessary and the non-necessary may perhaps be <lb/>
            the principle of all existence, or non-existence.</p>
          <p>7. Whatever exists of necessity, is in energy.</p>
          <p>8. If eternal natures are prior in existence, energy is <lb/>
            prior to power.</p>
          <p>9. The first substances are energies without power.</p>
          <p>10. Those are energies with power, which are prior by <lb/>
            nature, but posterior in time.</p>
          <p>11. Lastly, there are some which are never energies, but <lb/>
            capacities only.</p>
          <p>CnAP. XIV.—1. Those opinions are contrary which are of <lb/>
            contrary matter, and propositional contrariety corresponds <lb/>
            with the contrariety of opinion ; also as generations arise <lb/>
            from opposites, so also do deceptions.</p>
          <p>2. Contraries belong to those things which are the most <lb/>
            diverse about the same thing.</p><pb n="647"/>
            
          <p>3. Whatever things have no contraries, of these the op­ <lb/>
            posite to the true opinion is false.</p>
          <p>4. The opinion of good, that it is not good, will be the <lb/>
            proper contrary to that of good, that it is good.</p>
          <p>5. To " Every thing good is good," the contrary is <lb/>
            "Nothing is good;" but the contradictory to it is, “No­ <lb/>
            every thing is good."</p>

          <p>INTRODUCTORY.- IN this portion of his work, Aristotle <lb/>
            investigates the parts and principles of syllogism, and in the <lb/>
            Posterior Analytics, those of demonstration: unfolding the <lb/>
            icsolution of syllogisms from one figure to another, and ex­ <lb/>
            plaining how syllogisms framed without art, are reducible to <lb/>
            modes and figures.</p>
          <p>The theory of reasoning generally, with a view to ac­ <lb/>
            curate demonstration, depends upon the establishment of a <lb/>
            perfect syllogism, which is defined an enunciation, wherein <lb/>
            certain propositions being laid down, a necessary conclusion <lb/>
            is drawn, distinct from the propositions, and without the em­ <lb/>
            ployment of any idea not contained in them. For reason­ <lb/>
            ing is a certain transition from one thing to another, in the <lb/>
            development of successive truths, each dependent upon, and <lb/>
            concluded from, the other, when the last conclusion is pri­ <lb/>
            marily not conceded. Hence intellect and sense do not pro­ <lb/>
            duce arguments, because the perception of the former is intui­ <lb/>
            tive, and the inertness and mutability of the latter forbid it <lb/>
            to assume the province of reasoning. Neither can opinion <lb/>
            reason, since, though it may know conclusions, yet it cannot <lb/>
            frame them by a syllogistic process, so that demonstrative <lb/>
            reasoning results from certain principles, like axioms estab­ <lb/>
            lished and acted upon, the conclusions of which, derived by <lb/>
            fixed rules, are always true. Although indeed Aristotle, <lb/>
            after establishing the actual laws, did not fully elucidate their <lb/>
            results, appearing only to know the first three figures of the <lb/>
             <pb n="648"/>
            so-called Categorical syllogism, yet this does not militate <lb/>
            against the value of that inquiry into the facts relative to the <lb/>
            language of reasoning, instituted in the Analytics; since the <lb/>
            examination of the syllogism itself shows how the more general <lb/>
            principles of science must be obtained.</p>
          <p>The first figure he considers the only perfect syllogism, <lb/>
            because in this alone, an universal can be established. To <lb/>
            determine how the conclusion is formed and found, he dis­ <lb/>
            tinguishes three species of entity or being, one of which <lb/>
            cannot be predicated of any other; a second may be predi­ <lb/>
            cated of some other, which yet cannot be predicated of it; <lb/>
            whereas the third can be both predicated of other, and other <lb/>
            of it. By the first, all individuals are understood as appre­ <lb/>
            hended by the senses, or as contained in the lowest genera; <lb/>
            by the second, the highest genera; and by the third, the <lb/>
            genera intermediate between the highest and lowest. Now, <lb/>
            since from the highest genera, we can derive no conclusion, as <lb/>
            no other higher idea can be predicated of them; since also the <lb/>
            lowest cannot be concluded, as they cannot be predicated of <lb/>
            aught else, it remains that the demonstrative process acts <lb/>
            freely about the middle genera, in which procedure the essen­ <lb/>
            tial point is, to derive by experience from general notions <lb/>
            those which admit of being predicated of others. Moreover, <lb/>
            since Plato's method appeared to Aristotle vague and unsatis­ <lb/>
            factory, and virtually to involve a " petitio principii" in its <lb/>
            doctrine of the remembrance of ideas originally subsistent in <lb/>
            the human mind, being awoke by means of sensation ; he <lb/>
            established the syllogism of induction, which is further dis­ <lb/>
            . tinguished from the demonstrative, in that proceeding from <lb/>
            the lower notion, it shows the middle one to belong to the <lb/>
            higher, whereas the other proceeds from the middle notion, <lb/>
            and connects the lower with the higher. These two alone, <lb/>
            according to Aristotle, are strictly scientific procedures, and <lb/>
            in a word, the value of syllogism generally is proved by its <lb/>
            rendering the laws of thought necessary and certain, instead <lb/>
            of allowing them to become merely contingent, and by its sub­ <lb/>
            stitution of proof for vague probability.</p>
          <p>CHAP. I—1. The purport of this treatise being the attain­ <lb/>
            ment of demonstrative science, it is necessary to define a <lb/>
            proposition, a term, and a syllogism. Of the latter, more­ <lb/>
             <pb n="649"/>
            over, what kind is perfect, and what imperfect; also what <lb/>
            is meant by a thing being in a certain whole, and what <lb/>
            it is to be predicated of every thing, or of nothing of a <lb/>
            class.</p>
          <p>2. A proposition is a sentence affirming or denying some­ <lb/>
            thing of something, and is either universal, by which is im­ <lb/>
            plied presence with all or none; particular, the being pre­ <lb/>
            sent not with every thing; or indefinite, i. e. the being <lb/>
            present or not without the universal or particular sign.</p>
          <p>3. The demonstrative proposition is an assumption of <lb/>
            one part of contradiction ; the dialectic proposition is an in­ <lb/>
            terrogation of contradiction: as to forming the syllogism <lb/>
            from either, there exists no difference.</p>
          <p>1. A syllogistic proposition is an affirmation or negation <lb/>
            of something concerning something, after the above-men­ <lb/>
            tioned modes.</p>
          <p>5. A term is that into which a proposition is resolved, <lb/>
            e. g. the predicate and the subject, with or without the <lb/>
            copula.</p>
          <p>6. A syllogism is a sentence wherein certain things be­ <lb/>
            ing laid down, something else different from the premises <lb/>
            necessarily results in consequence of their existence ; and a <lb/>
            perfect syllogism is that which requires nothing else be­ <lb/>
            yond the premises assumed, for the necessary consequence <lb/>
            to appear.</p>
          <p>7. Predication "de omni” is said to occur when nothing <lb/>
            can be assumed of the subject of which the other may not <lb/>
            be asserted ; and “de nullo" the reverse.</p>
          <p>CHAP. II.—1. The universal negative proposition (E) is con­ <lb/>
            verted universally.</p>
          <p>2. A and I are converted particularly.</p>
          <p>3. The conversion of 0 is unnecessary.</p>
          <p>CHAP. III.—1. The same rule obtains in the conversion of <lb/>
            necessary (modal) propositions.</p>
          <p>2. In contingent affirmatives, the conversion is similarly <lb/>
            ordered, but this is not the case with negatives, but in these <lb/>
            E is not converted, but 0 is.</p>
          <p>CHAP. IV.—1. Syllogism is more universal than demonstra­ <lb/>
            tion, since demonstration is a certain syllogism, but not <lb/>
             <pb n="650"/>
            every syllogism is demonstration; hence the former is first <lb/>
            discussed.</p>
          <p>2. When three terms so subsist with reference to each <lb/>
            other, as that the last is in the whole of the middle, and the <lb/>
            middle is or is not in the whole of the first, there is then a <lb/>
            perfect syllogism of the extremes.</p>
          <p>3. The middle is that which is itself in another, while <lb/>
            another is in it, and which becomes the middle by posi­ <lb/>
            tion, i. e. in the first figure.</p>
          <p>4. The extreme is that which is itself in another and in <lb/>
            which another also is.</p>
          <p>5. If the first is in every middle, but the middle is in no <lb/>
            last, there is not a syllogism of the extremes.</p>
          <p>6. If one of the terms be universal and the other particu­ <lb/>
            lar, when the major extreme is universal (A or E), but the <lb/>
            minor I, there is necessarily a perfect syllogism.</p>
          <p>7. The major extreme is defined that in which the mid­ <lb/>
            dle is, the minor that which is under the middle.</p>
          <p>8. The syllogistic ratio is the same for the indefinite as <lb/>
            for the particular.</p>
          <p>9. If the minor be universal, but the major particular or <lb/>
            indefinite, there is no syllogism.</p>
          <p>10. Nor when the major is A or E, but the minor O.</p>
          <p>11. Nor when both propositions are particular, or one or <lb/>
            both indefinite.</p>
          <p>12. From the above, it is concluded that the first figure <lb/>
            is complete, and comprehends all classes of affirmation and <lb/>
            negation.</p>
          <p>CHAP. V.—1. The second figure is defined to be that where­ <lb/>
            in the middle is present with every individual of the one, <lb/>
            but with none of the other term, or with every or with none <lb/>
            of each.</p>
          <p>2. The middle term is that which is predicated of both <lb/>
            extremes.</p>
          <p>3. The extremes are those of which the middle is predi­ <lb/>
            cated : the greater extreme being that which is placed near <lb/>
            the middle, and the less that which is further from the middle.</p>
          <p>4. No perfect syllogism occurs in this figure from the <lb/>
            middle being placed beyond the extremes, and being first <lb/>
            in position.</p><pb n="651"/>
            
          <p>5. From universal affirmatives or negatives, there is no <lb/>
            consequence : also when the major is A or E, and the minor <lb/>
            I or 0, the conclusion is O.</p>
          <p>6. An affirmative syllogism is not produced in this figure, <lb/>
            but all are negative, both the universal and the particular.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VI.—1. The third figure is defined to be that in which <lb/>
            with the same thing one is present with every, and another <lb/>
            with no individual, or both with every or with none.</p>
          <p>2. The middle is that of which we predicate both.</p>
          <p>3. The predicates are the extremes, the greater being <lb/>
            more remote from, the less nearer to, the middle.</p>
          <p>4. There is no perfect syllogism in this figure.</p>
          <p>5. When both premises are affirmative, there will be a <lb/>
            syllogism, but not when both are negative: moreover, the <lb/>
            major may be negative and the minor affirmative.</p>
          <p>6. An universal conclusion cannot be drawn from this <lb/>
            figure.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VI.—1. In all the three figures generally, if one pre­ <lb/>
            mise be A or I, and the other E, in the conclusion the <lb/>
            minor is predicated of the major.</p>
          <p>2. An indefinite taken for I, will produce the same syl­ <lb/>
            logism in all the figures.</p>
          <p>3. All incomplete syllogisms are completed by conversion <lb/>
            in the first figure.</p>
          <p>4. All syllogisms may be reduced to universals in the <lb/>
            first figure.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VIII.—1. A different syllogism arises from the simple <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπαρχειν</foreign>, the TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀναγκαι̃ον ἔιναι</foreign>and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ἐνδἐχεσθαι</foreign>.</p>
          <p>2. Necessary syllogisms resemble generally those which <lb/>
            are absolute.</p>
          <p>CHAP. IX.—1. Conclusion of a syllogism with one necessary <lb/>
            premise often follows the major.</p>
          <p>CHAP. X.—1. In the second figure when one necessary pre­ <lb/>
            mise is joined with a simple one, the conclusion follows the <lb/>
            negative necessary premise.</p>
          <p>2. If the affirmative be necessary, the conclusion will <lb/>
            not be.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XI.—1. In the third figure, if either premise be neces­ <lb/>
            sary and both be A, the conclusion will be necessary.</p><pb n="652"/>
            
          <p>2. If one premise be A or I, when A is necessary, the <lb/>
            conclusion is so, but not when I is necessary.</p>
          <p>3. When the affirmative is necessary, either A or I, or <lb/>
            when 0 is assumed, there will not be a necessary conclusion.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XII.—1. There is no pure categorical syllogism unless <lb/>
            both premises are affirmative.</p>
          <p>2. One of the premises must be similar to the conclusion, <lb/>
            therefore also it appears that there is no simple or neces­ <lb/>
            sary conclusion, unless one premise be necessary or pure.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XIII.—1. The contingent is defined that which, not <lb/>
            being necessary, but assumed to exist, nothing impossible <lb/>
            hence arises; the accuracy of this definition is proved by <lb/>
            opposite affirmatives and negatives.</p>
          <p>2. All contingent propositions are mutually convertible, <lb/>
            i. e. as many as have an affirmative figure, as to opposition.</p>
          <p>3. The contingent is predicated in two ways, one gener­ <lb/>
            ally, the other indefinitely, and the method of conversion <lb/>
            varies in each.</p>
          <p>4. As science and the demonstrative syllogism do not <lb/>
            belong to indefinites, the indefinite contingent is not gener­ <lb/>
            ally investigated.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XIV.—1. With contingent premises, both universal, <lb/>
            there will be a perfect syllogism.</p>
          <p>2. When the premises are both negative, or the minor <lb/>
            negative, there is either no syllogism or an incomplete one; <lb/>
            in the case of the major universal with the minor particular, <lb/>
            there is a perfect syllogism.</p>
          <p>3. Hence it is concluded, that when the premises are A <lb/>
            or E, a syllogism arises in the first figure, the former (A) <lb/>
            complete, the latter (E) incomplete.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XV.—1. In syllogisms with mixed premises, (pure and <lb/>
            modal,) if the major is contingent, the syllogism will be <lb/>
            perfect, not otherwise.</p>
          <p>2. From a false hypothesis, not impossible, a similar con­ <lb/>
            clusion follows.</p>
          <p>3. Universal predication is not to be limited by time.</p>
          <p>4. The general law of mixed syllogisms is that when the <lb/>
            minor premise is contingent, a syllogism is constructed, <lb/>
            either directly or by conversion.</p><pb n="653"/>
            
          <p>5. If the major is particular there will be no syllogism, <lb/>
            neither if both premises be particular or indefinite.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XVI.—1. When one premise is necessary and pure, and <lb/>
            the other contingent, there is a syllogism perfect when the <lb/>
            minor is necessary.</p>
          <p>2. When both premises are A, there is not a necessary <lb/>
            conclusion.</p>
          <p>3. Also in particular syllogism, when the negative is <lb/>
            necessary the conclusion is simply negative.</p>
          <p>4. When in a negative syllogism the particular affirma­ <lb/>
            tive is necessary, there is no syllogism de inesse. Neither <lb/>
            if the minor be universal and the major particular necessary.</p>
          <p>5. Nor when indefinite propositions or both particular are <lb/>
            assumed, will there be a syllogism.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XVII.—1. In the second figure when both premises <lb/>
            are contingent there is no syllogism, nor if the affirmative <lb/>
            be pure and the other contingent.</p>
          <p>2. A contingent negative is not convertible in its terms.</p>
          <p>3. Contingency is predicated negatively in two ways, <lb/>
            either if a thing is necessarily present with something, or <lb/>
            if it is necessarily not present with something.</p>
          <p>4. From two premises A or E, contingent in the second <lb/>
            figure, no syllogism is constructed.</p>
          <p>5. Nor from one universal and the other particular, or <lb/>
            both particular or indefinite.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XVIII.—1. If one proposition signifies the inesse, and <lb/>
            the other the contingent, the affirmative being simple, but <lb/>
            the negative contingent, there will never be a syllogism, <lb/>
            but there will be when the affirmative is contingent, but <lb/>
            the negative simple.</p>
          <p>2. If both propositions be negative, there is a syllogism <lb/>
            by conversion of the contingent.</p>
          <p>3. If both be affirmative, there will not be a syllogism.</p>
          <p>4. If the negative be pure and particular, there will not <lb/>
            be a syllogism, nor when both are assumed indefinite.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XIX.—1. In syllogisms with one necessary and the <lb/>
            other a contingent premise in the second figure, when the <lb/>
            negative is necessary, a syllogism may be constructed, but <lb/>
            not when the affirmative is necessary.</p>
          <p>2. When both premises are negative, a syllogism is formed <lb/>
             <pb n="654"/>
            by converting the contingent, but if both be affirmative, <lb/>
            there is no syllogism, neither if both premises be indefinite <lb/>
            or particular.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XX.—1. In the third figure with both premises or only <lb/>
            one contingent, there is a syllogism in which the conclusion <lb/>
            follows the contingent.</p>
          <p>2. If one premise be universal and the other particular, <lb/>
            there will and will not be a syllogism, but there will not <lb/>
            be one when both are particular or indefinite.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XXI.—1. A contingent is inferred in the third figure <lb/>
            from one simple and another contingent premise.</p>
          <p>2. From a negative minor or from two negatives no syl­ <lb/>
            logism results.</p>
          <p>3. When both premises are indefinite or particular, there <lb/>
            is not a syllogism.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XXII.—1. If one premise be necessary, but the other <lb/>
            contingent in the third figure, a syllogism of the contingent <lb/>
            arises when the terms are affirmative.</p>
          <p>2. When one is affirmative necessary, but the other ne­ <lb/>
            gative, there is a syllogism of the contingent non-inesse ; <lb/>
            if it be negative, there will be one both of the contingent <lb/>
            and of the pure non-inesse.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XXIII.—1. Every syllogism must show affirmation or <lb/>
            negation of the inesse; either universally or partially, <lb/>
            ostensively or by hypothesis.</p>
          <p>2. In the ostensive a simple conclusion must have two <lb/>
            preliminary propositions connected by a middle term, which <lb/>
            connexion is three-fold, and all ostensive syllogisms are <lb/>
            perfected by the above-named figures.</p>
          <p>3. Of syllogism per impossibile there is the same method, <lb/>
            which kind of reasoning implies the showing an impossi­ <lb/>
            bility from the original hypothesis.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XXIV.—1. In every syllogism it is necessary that there <lb/>
            be one term affirmative, and one universal.</p>
          <p>2. An universal conclusion follows from universal pre­ <lb/>
            mises, though sometimes only a particular, results.</p>
          <p>3. One premise must resemble the conclusion in charac­ <lb/>
            ter and quality.</p><pb n="655"/>
            
          <p>CHAP. XXV.—1. Every demonstrative syllogism consists ot <lb/>
            only three terms, and of two premises.</p>
          <p>2. The same conclusion may arise from many syllogisms.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XXVI.—1. The conclusion by more figures constitutes <lb/>
            a greater facility of demonstration.</p>
          <p>2. An universal affirmative is proved by the first figure, <lb/>
            in one way only.</p>
          <p>3. A negative is proved in one way by the first figure, <lb/>
            and in two ways by the second figure.</p>
          <p>4. A particular affirmative is proved by the first and <lb/>
            third figures, in one way by the first, and in three ways by <lb/>
            the last.</p>
          <p>5. A particular negative is proved by all the figures, in the <lb/>
            1st in one way, in the 2nd in two, and in the 3rd in three.</p>
          <p>6. An universal affirmative is most difficult of construc­ <lb/>
            tion, and easiest of subversion, and universals generally are <lb/>
            more easy to subvert than particulars, which last are easier <lb/>
            of construction.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XXVII.—1. In the analysis of the principles of syllo­ <lb/>
            gism, it is observable that there are several kinds of predi­ <lb/>
            cates, some of which can only be employed accidentally. <lb/>
            Also, there are some things at which we must stop, since <lb/>
            another predicate of them cannot be pointed out.</p>
          <p>2. Argument generally is conversant with intermediates, <lb/>
            that is, with such as may be predicated of others, and <lb/>
            others of them.</p>
          <p>3. In the arrangement of propositions we must first as­ <lb/>
            sume (hypothetically) the subject, the definitions, and the <lb/>
            peculiarities of a thing: next, its consequents, and what it <lb/>
            is consequent to; lastly, such as cannot be in it.</p>
          <p>4. In the consequents, what are predicated as properties <lb/>
            must be distinguished from what are so as accidents: also <lb/>
            if according to opinion or to truth.</p>
          <p>5. The universal and not the particular consequents are <lb/>
            to be selected: and the properties of each thing must be <lb/>
            taken, but not things consequent to all.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XXVIII.—1. Every portion of the problem must be <lb/>
            examined; also the first elements in the consequents and <lb/>
            antecedents, end those which are for the most part uni­ <lb/>
            versal.</p><pb n="656"/>
            
          <p>2. Whoever wishes to conclude a negative, must take a <lb/>
            middle, which concurs with one extreme.</p>
          <p>3. We must select in investigation, not that wherein the <lb/>
            terms differ, but in which they agree.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XXIX.—1. The same method must be observed in se­ <lb/>
            lecting a middle term in syllogisms of "the impossible" as <lb/>
            in the others.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XXX.—1. The method of demonstration laid down pre­ <lb/>
            viously is applicable to all matters of philosophical inquiry.</p>
          <p>2. As the appropriate principles of every science are <lb/>
            many, it belongs to experience to supply those of each thing.</p>
          <p>3. The end of analytical investigation is to elucidate sub­ <lb/>
            jects naturally abstruse.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XXXI.—1. Division through genera, i. e. by which the <lb/>
            latter are divided into species by addition of differences, is <lb/>
            a species of weak syllogism, being in some sort a petitio <lb/>
            principii.</p>
          <p>2. In demonstration of the absolute, the middle must be <lb/>
            less, and not universal, in respect of the first extreme.</p>
          <p>3. Division is unsuitable for refutation, and for various <lb/>
            kinds of question.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XXXII.—1. In order to reduce every syllogism to one <lb/>
            of the three figures, we must first investigate the proposi­ <lb/>
            tions, as to quantity, examining also wherein they are su­ <lb/>
            perfluous or deficient.</p>
          <p>2. Next, consider the reality of inference.</p>
          <p>3. Ascertain the figure to which properly the problem <lb/>
            belongs, by the middle.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XXXIII.—1. Error frequently arises from our matter <lb/>
            tion to the relative quantity of propositions.</p>
          <p>CHAP, XXXIV.—1. Also from an inaccurate exposition of the <lb/>
            terms.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XXXV.—1. The middle must not always be assumed <lb/>
            as a particular definite thing, since one word cannot always <lb/>
            be used for some terms, inasmuch as they are sentences.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XXXVI.—I. For the construction of a syllogism, it is <lb/>
            not always requisite that one term should be predicated of <lb/>
             <pb n="657"/>
            the other, "casu rector as either major or minor premises, <lb/>
            or both may have an oblique case.</p>
          <p>2. The proposition must be assumed according to the <lb/>
            case of the noun.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XXXVII.—1. For true and absolute predication, we <lb/>
            must accept the several varieties of categorical division.</p>
          <p>CHAP, XXXVIII.—1. Whatever is reiterated must be annexed <lb/>
            to the major, not to the middle term.</p>
          <p>2. The position of the terms differs, according as the in­ <lb/>
            ference is simple or qualified.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XXXIX.—1. In syllogistic analysis, simplicity of terms <lb/>
            and perspicuity are to be studied.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XL.—1. The definite article is to be added, according <lb/>
            to the nature of the conclusion.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XLI.—1. There are certain forms of universal predica­ <lb/>
            tion which require distinction ; e. g. it is not the same <lb/>
            thing to assert that A is present with every individual with <lb/>
            which B is, and to say that A is present with every indi­ <lb/>
            vidual of what B is present with.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XLII.—1. All conclusions in the same syllogism are <lb/>
            not produced by one figure, but the conclusion shows in <lb/>
            what figure the inquiry is to be made.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XLIII.—1. For the sake of brevity, the thing impugned <lb/>
            in the definition, and not the whole definition itself, is to be <lb/>
            laid down.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XLIV.—1. Hypothetical syllogisms need not be reduced, <lb/>
            as they are admitted by consent.</p>
          <p>2. Nor syllogisms per impossibile, which are incapable of <lb/>
            analysis: for the present, however, further consideration <lb/>
            of hypotheticals is deferred.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XLV.—1. Whatever syllogisms are proved in many <lb/>
            figures, may be reduced from one figure to another.</p>
          <p>2. Universals in the second are reducible to the first, but <lb/>
            only one particular.</p>
          <p>3. Of those in the third figure one only, when the nega­ <lb/>
            tive is not universal, is not reducible to the first.</p>
          <p>4. In order to reduction, the <unclear>:r</unclear> ersion of the minor <lb/>
            premise is necessary. <note type="footnote"> 2 u </note></p><pb n="658"/>
            
          <p>5. Syllogisms of the third figure, may be reduced to the <lb/>
            second, when the negative is aniversal.</p>
          <p>6. Those syllogisms are not mutually reducible into the <lb/>
            other figures, which are not into the first.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XLVI.—1. There is a difference in statement arising <lb/>
            from whether we conceive the expressions " not to be " and <lb/>
            "to be not" identical or different: it is shown that they <lb/>
            are not the former.</p>
          <p>2. As to the relation also between privatives and attri­ <lb/>
            butes, the different character of the assertion is proved by <lb/>
            the difference in the mode of demonstration.</p>
          <p>3. A fallacy often arises from not assuming opposites <lb/>
            properly.</p>

          <p>CHAP. I.—1. UNIVERSAL syllogisms infer many conclusions, <lb/>
            so also do the particular affirmative, but the negative par­ <lb/>
            ticular infer one only.</p>
          <p>2. Three conclusions may be drawn from the same syllo­ <lb/>
            gism, viz. one of the minor extreme, another of what is un­ <lb/>
            der the minor, the third of what is the subject of the middle.</p>
          <p>CHAP. II.—1. The propositions of a syllogism may be true or <lb/>
            false indifferently, but the conclusion must of necessity be <lb/>
            either one or the other.</p>
          <p>2. From true propositions we cannot infer a falsity, but <lb/>
            from false premises we may infer the truth, except that not <lb/>
            the why" but the mere “that” is inferred.</p>
          <p>3. When the major is wholly false, but the minor is true, <lb/>
            the conclusion is false; but when the whole is not assumed <lb/>
            false, the conclusion is true.</p>
          <p>4. If the major is true wholly, but the minor wholly false, <lb/>
            the conclusion is true.</p>
          <p>5. In particulars with a major false, but a minor true, <lb/>
            there may be a true conclusion.</p>
          <p>6. If the major is partly false, the conclusion will be true.</p>
          <p>CHAP. III.—1. In the middle figure we may infer the true <lb/>
            from premises, either one or both wholly or partially false.</p>
          <p>CHAP. IV.—1. The case is the same in the third, as in the <lb/>
            preceding figures.</p><pb n="659"/>
            
          <p>2. Particulars follow the same rule, i. e. those with one <lb/>
            universal and one particular premise.</p>
          <p>3. If the conclusion be false there must be falsity in one <lb/>
            or more of the premises, but this does not hold good vice <lb/>
            versâ.</p>
          <p>CHAP. V.—1. The demonstration of things in a circle and <lb/>
            from each other is by the conclusion, and by taking one <lb/>
            proposition converse in predication to conclude the other, <lb/>
            which we had taken in a former syllogism.</p>
          <p>2. A demonstration of this kind not truly made, except <lb/>
            through converted terms, and then by assumption "pro <lb/>
            concesso " only.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VI.—1. As to the same in the second figure, in uni­ <lb/>
            versals an affirmative proposition is not demonstrated.</p>
          <p>2. In particulars, the particular proposition alone is de­ <lb/>
            monstrated when the universal is affirmative.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VII.—1. In the third figure, when both propositions <lb/>
            are universal, there is no circular demonstration.</p>
          <p>2. There will be demonstration where the minor is uni­ <lb/>
            versal, and the major particular.</p>
          <p>3. When the affirmative is universal there is demonstra­ <lb/>
            tion of the particular negative, but not when the negative <lb/>
            is universal.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VIII.—1. Conversion is by transposition of the conclu­ <lb/>
            sion to produce a syllogism, either that the major is not <lb/>
            with the middle, or that this last is not with the minor.</p>
          <p>2. There is a different syllogism, according as the above <lb/>
            is done contradictorily or contrarily.</p>
          <p>CHAP. IX.—1. As to conversions in the second figure, we <lb/>
            cannot, in universals, infer the contrary to the major pre­ <lb/>
            mise, but we may the contradictory ; the minor is depend­ <lb/>
            ent upon the assumption of the conclusion.</p>
          <p>2. In particulars, if the contrary of the conclusion be as­ <lb/>
            sumed, neither proposition is subverted ; if the contra­ <lb/>
            dictory, both are.</p>
          <p>CHAP. X.—1. In the third figure, if the contrary to the con­ <lb/>
            clusion be assumed, or the contradictory, the same result <lb/>
            respectively occurs, as in particulars of the second figure.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XI.—1. A syllogism ”per impossibile" is shown when <note type="footnote"> 2 U 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="660"/>
            the contradiction of the conclusion is laid down and another <lb/>
            proposition is assumed: it is produced in all the figures.</p>
          <p>2. It resembles conversion, except that the opposite is <lb/>
            not previously acknowledged, but is manifestly true.</p>
          <p>3. In the first figure the universal affirmative is not de­ <lb/>
            monstrable " per impossibile."</p>
          <p>4. The particular affirmative and universal negative may <lb/>
            be demonstrated, when the contradictory of the conclusion <lb/>
            is assumed.</p>
          <p>5. The particular negative is demonstrated, but if the <lb/>
            sub-contrary to the conclusion be assumed, what was pro­ <lb/>
            posed is subverted.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XII.—1. In the second figure A is proved "per ab­ <lb/>
            surdum," if the contradictory be assumed, not if the con­ <lb/>
            trary.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XIII.—1. In the third figure, both affirmatives and <lb/>
            negatives are demonstrable "per absurdum."</p>
          <p>CHAP. XIV.1—. A demonstration to the impossible differs <lb/>
            from the ostensive, in that it admits what it wishes to sub­ <lb/>
            vert, leading to an acknowledged falsehood, whilst the <lb/>
            ostensive commences from confessed theses: in the osten­ <lb/>
            sive also, the conclusion need not be known, whether it is <lb/>
            or is not, but in the other we must previously assume that <lb/>
            it is not.</p>
          <p>2. What is demonstrated " per absurdum " in the first <lb/>
            figure, is proved in the second ostensively, if the problem <lb/>
            be negative, and in the third figure if it be affirmative.</p>
          <p>3. What is demonstrable "per absurdum," is so also <lb/>
            ostensively, and vice versa.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XV.—1. Opposite propositions are according to diction <lb/>
            four, apparently, but in truth, they are three.</p>
          <p>2. There is no conclusion from opposites of either kind <lb/>
            in the first figure, but from both in the second; in the third <lb/>
            no affirmation is deduced.</p>
          <p>3. Since the oppositions of affirmations are three, we may <lb/>
            take opposites in six ways.</p>
          <p>4. From such propositions no true conclusion is deduci­ <lb/>
            ble, but from contradictories a contradiction to the assump­ <lb/>
            tion is inferred ; in order, however, to infer contradiction in <lb/>
            the conclusion, we must have contradiction in the premises.</p><pb n="661"/>
            
          <p>CHAP. XVI.—1. A "petitio principii" generically defined, <lb/>
            consists in not demonstrating the proposition, which also <lb/>
            happens in many ways, when a person tries to show by it­ <lb/>
            self, what cannot be known by itself: mathematicians are <lb/>
            frequently guilty of this fallacy.</p>
          <p>2. This error may occur in both the second and third <lb/>
            figures; but in the case of an affirmative syllogism, in the <lb/>
            third and first.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XVII.—1. In the consideration of the syllogism, in <lb/>
            which it is argued that the false does not happen " on ac­ <lb/>
            count of this" (<foreign xml:lang="grc">παρὰ του̃το</foreign>), it is remarked as occurrent, <lb/>
            first in a deduction to the impossible which is contradicted, <lb/>
            not in ostensive demonstration.</p>
          <p>2. A perfect example of this is, when the syllogism lead­ <lb/>
            ing to the impossible does not conjoin with the hypothesis <lb/>
            by its media: it is necessary however to connect the im­ <lb/>
            possible with the terms assumed from the first.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XVIII.—1. False reasoning arises from error, in the <lb/>
            primary propositions.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XIX.—1. In order to prevent a catasyllogism, or syllo­ <lb/>
            gistical conclusion being adduced against us, we must watch <lb/>
            against the same term being twice admitted in the pro­ <lb/>
            position.</p>
          <p>2. In argument, we should conceal that which we direct <lb/>
            the respondent to guard against, and the two methods of <lb/>
            effecting this are:</p>
          <p>1st, If the conclusions are not pre-syllogized, but un­ <lb/>
            known, when necessary propositions are assumed.</p>
          <p>2ndly, If a person does not question things proximate, <lb/>
            but such as are especially immediate.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XX.—1. An elenchus is a syllogism of contradiction, to <lb/>
            produce which there must be a syllogism, though the latter <lb/>
            may subsist without the former.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XXI.—1. Deception, as to supposition ( <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατὰ , τὴν ὑπό­ <lb/>
            ληψιν</foreign>), arises if the same thing being present with many <lb/>
            primary, a person should be ignorant of one, and think it <lb/>
            present with nothing, but should know the other; or if a <lb/>
            man is deceived about things from the same class.</p>
          <p>2. There is a difference between universal and particular <lb/>
             <pb n="662"/>
            science: for we have not a pre-existent knowledge of par­ <lb/>
            ticulars, but together with induction receive the science of <lb/>
            particulars, as it were by recognition, after which manner <lb/>
            is the reasoning in the Meno, that discipline is reminiscence.</p>
          <p>3. Some things we immediately know, and by universal <lb/>
            knowledge observe particulars; but as we do not know <lb/>
            them by innate, peculiar knowledge, we are liable to decep­ <lb/>
            tion, yet not contrarily, but possessing the universal, may <lb/>
            err in the particular.</p>
          <p>4. Scientific knowledge is predicated triply; as to the <lb/>
            universal, the peculiar, or as to energizing, hence deception <lb/>
            is incident in as many ways.</p>
          <p>5. From the above, it results that a man may imagine a <lb/>
            thing concurrent with its contrary.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XXII.—1. If the terms connected by a certain middle <lb/>
            are converted, the middle must be converted with both: in <lb/>
            converting a negative syllogism the method commences from <lb/>
            the conclusion.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XXIII.—1. Not only dialectic and demonstrative syllo­ <lb/>
            gisms, but also rhetorical, and every kind of demonstration <lb/>
            are through the above-named figures: we believe all things <lb/>
            either through syllogism or induction.</p>
          <p>2. Induction then, or the inductive syllogism, is to prove <lb/>
            one extreme in the middle through the other, i. e. proving <lb/>
            the major of the middle by the minor: it is also occur­ <lb/>
            rent in those demonstrations which are proved without a <lb/>
            middle.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XXIV.—1. Example (<foreign xml:lang="grc">παράδειγμα</foreign>), is proving the major <lb/>
            of the middle, by a term resembling the minor. It subsists <lb/>
            as part to part, and differs from induction because the lat­ <lb/>
            ter shows from all individuals that the major is present with <lb/>
            the middle, and does not join the syllogism to the extreme, <lb/>
            but the former both joins it and does not demonstrate from <lb/>
            all individuals.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XXV.—1. Abduction (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπαγωγη</foreign>), is a syllogism with a <lb/>
            major premise certain, and the minor more credible than <lb/>
            the conclusion : moreover, when the minor is proved by the <lb/>
            interposition of few middle terms.</p>
          <p>CnAP. XXVI.—1. Objection (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνστασις</foreign>), is a proposition con <lb/>
             <pb n="663"/>
            trary to a proposition, it differs from a proposition, how­ <lb/>
            ever, in that it may be either <foreign xml:lang="grc">καθόλον</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπὶ μέρος</foreign>.</p>
          <p>2. It is occurrent in two figures, because they are used <lb/>
            opposite to the proposition, and opposites are concluded in <lb/>
            the first and third figures alone: wherefore, if the proposi­ <lb/>
            tion is negative, an objection to it cannot be proper in the <lb/>
            second figure, since the objection ought to affirm.</p>
          <p>3. Objections may be adduced from the contrary, the <lb/>
            similar, and from what is according to opinion.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XXVII.—1. Likelihood (<foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰκός</foreign>) is a probable proposition, <lb/>
            for what men know to have generally happened or not, or <lb/>
            to be, or not to be, this is a likelihood.</p>
          <p>2. A sign (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σημείον</foreign>), is a demonstrative preposition, either <lb/>
            necessary or probable; it is assumed triply, according to <lb/>
            the number of figures.</p>
          <p>3. An entbymeme is a syllogism drawn from either of <lb/>
            these.</p>
          <p>4. If one proposition be enunciated, there is only a sign, <lb/>
            but if the other also, there is a syllogism, which last, if it <lb/>
            be true, is incontrovertible in the first figure, but not so in <lb/>
            the last or second figure.</p>
          <p>5. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τεκμήριον</foreign> (indicium), is a syllogism in the first figure, <lb/>
            which Aristotle proves to belong to it, by the example of <lb/>
            physiognomy ; the first physiognomic hypothesis being that <lb/>
            natural passion changes at one time the body and soul; the <lb/>
            second, that there is one sign of one passion; the third, <lb/>
            that the proper passion of each species of animal may be <lb/>
            known. Whatever, however, is inferred in this respect, is <lb/>
            collected in the first figure.</p>

          <p>INTRoDuCToRy.-The title of Prior and Posterior was given <lb/>
            to the Analytics in the time of Galen ; in the first, syllogisms <lb/>
            are considered in respect of their form ; in the last, ir respect <lb/>
            of their matter.</p>
          <p>From certain premises a conclusion being formally drawn, <lb/>
             <pb n="664"/>
            demonstration is deduced, and also demonstrative science. <lb/>
            Syllogisms of this kind, called apodeictic, are the subject of <lb/>
            the Posterior Analytics: dialectic syllogisms, or those from <lb/>
            uncertain and merely probable premises, are discussed in the <lb/>
            eight books of the Topics; whilst such as are apparently, <lb/>
            yet not really perfect in matter and form, being fallacious, <lb/>
            are called sophistical, and are found in the book under that <lb/>
            title.</p>
          <p>All knowledge rests upon antecedent conviction, and as the <lb/>
            general principle which is the basis of all demonstrative rea­ <lb/>
            soning is better known in itself and in its nature, so the par­ <lb/>
            ticulars from which induction proceeds, are better known to us. <lb/>
            This antecedent knowledge is the major proposition of a syl­ <lb/>
            logism, the conclusion being the application of the general to <lb/>
            the particular, whence the syllogism is the form of all proper <lb/>
            science, nor, though strongly attacked by Ramus, has the lat­ <lb/>
            ter critic ever substituted a better inferential method.</p>
          <p>From these statements, it follows that things cannot be de­ <lb/>
            monstrated in a circle; neither can the number of middle terms <lb/>
            between the first principle and the conclusion be infinite. <lb/>
            Again, these principles and intermediate propositions must he <lb/>
            necessary and general, since of what is fortuitous or mutable <lb/>
            there is no demonstration. Of all figures the first is best <lb/>
            adapted to demonstration, from its conclusions being univers­ <lb/>
            ally affirmative, and as the proof of an affirmative is prefer­ <lb/>
            able to that of a negative, so universal is more eligible than <lb/>
            particular and direct demonstration to that ad absurdum.</p>
          <p>Moreover, since it is one thing to know that a thing is so, <lb/>
            and another to know why it is so, we have to consider demon­ <lb/>
            stration in two respects, that <foreign xml:lang="grc">του̃ ὄτι</foreign>, or “ the deduction of the <lb/>
            cause from a consideration of the effect;" and the other, <foreign xml:lang="grc">του̃ <lb/>
            διὸτι</foreign>, "the deduction of the effect from the presence of the <lb/>
            caused In the second book therefore, we have an exposition <lb/>
            of cause, definition, and the acquisition of first principles, and <lb/>
            we may remark that so closely did Aristotle consider intel­ <lb/>
            lectual knowledge and sensuous perception blended with each <lb/>
            other, in the cognizance of these elements, that he broadly as­ <lb/>
            serts the loss of a sense to entail the loss of a species of sci­ <lb/>
            ence. The knowledge of first principles, indeed, is not ac. <lb/>
            quired by demonstration, and not being entitled to be called <lb/>
            bcience is termed intelligence; still the conception of the <lb/>
             <pb n="665"/>
            general, is in a manner in the soul itself, and Aristotle did not <lb/>
            so derive all scientific knowledge from the senses, as not to <lb/>
            draw a strong distinction between experience and science, as <lb/>
            also between memory and intellectual thought.1</p>
          <p>CHAP. I.—1. All doctrine and intellectual discipline arise <lb/>
            from pre-existent knowledge, e. g. mathematical sciences, <lb/>
            also arguments, whether syllogistic or inductive: this pre­ <lb/>
            vious knowledge, however, must be possessed in a two-fold <lb/>
            respect, either with some things presupposing that they are, <lb/>
            or with others understanding the subject; with some again, <lb/>
            both must be known.</p>
          <p>2. What we know universally and generally, we may <lb/>
            not know singly, yet not in the same manner; indeed a <lb/>
            man may in a certain respect know, and in another be <lb/>
            ignorant.</p>
          <p>CHAP. II.—1. Scientific knowledge is possessed when we know <lb/>
            the necessary connexion between a thing and its cause.</p>
          <p>2. Demonstration being a scientific syllogism, i. e. a syl­ <lb/>
            logism which causes us to know, it is necessary that de­ <lb/>
            monstrative science should be from things true, first, im­ <lb/>
            mediate, more known than, prior to, and the causes of the <lb/>
            conclusion.</p>
          <p>3. Things are prior and more known in two ways ; 1st, <lb/>
            As regards nature; 2nd, As regards ourselves; the latter <lb/>
            are such as are nearer to sense, the most remote are those <lb/>
            which are especially universal, the nearest are such as are <lb/>
            singular.</p>
          <p>4. The principle of demonstration is an immediate pro­ <lb/>
            position, the latter is that to which there is no other prior.</p>
          <p>5. A proposition is one part of enunciation ; dialectic, <lb/>
            which similarly assumes either part of contradiction; de­ <lb/>
            monstrative, that which definitely assumes one part to be <lb/>
            true.</p>
          <p>6. Enunciation is either part of contradiction; contra­ <lb/>
            diction is an opposition which has no medium in respect to <lb/>
            itself; affirmation is that part of the latter which declares <note type="footnote">1 This is well laid down by Ritter, to whose great work the reader is <lb/>
            referred, as well as to the excellent remarks upon formal and material <lb/>
            induction, enunciated by Mansel in his Prolegomena Logica. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="666"/>
            something of somewhat; negation that which signifies some <lb/>
            thing from somewhat.</p>
          <p>7. The thesis of an immediate syllogistic principle is that <lb/>
            which we cannot demonstrate, nor need the learner possess <lb/>
            it: what the latter must possess is an axiom.</p>
          <p>8. Of thesis, that which receives either part of contra­ <lb/>
            diction is hypothesis; what is without this, is definition.</p>
          <p>9. He who would possess knowledge through demonstra­ <lb/>
            tion, must not only know in a greater degree first princi­ <lb/>
            ples ; but also nothing should be more credible or known <lb/>
            to him than the opposites of the principles, from which a <lb/>
            syllogism of contra-deception may consist.</p>
          <p>CHAP. III.—1. Two errors occur as to science and demonstra­ <lb/>
            tion, the one in thinking that science does not exist, because <lb/>
            first things must be known; the other in the supposition <lb/>
            that there are demonstrations of all things, whereas all sci­ <lb/>
            ence is not demonstrable, for that of things immediate is <lb/>
            indemonstrable, and at these we must some time or other <lb/>
            arrive.</p>
          <p>2. There is not only science, but also a certain principle <lb/>
            of it, by which we know terms: we cannot however de­ <lb/>
            monstrate in a circle simply.</p>
          <p>CHAP. IV.—1. A syllogism is a demonstration from necessary <lb/>
            propositions, previous to examining which last, it is neces­ <lb/>
            sary to define, " of every," " per sc," and " universal."</p>
          <p>2. "Of every" is that which is not in a certain thing, <lb/>
            and in another certain thing is not, nor which is at one <lb/>
            time, and not at another.</p>
          <p>3. Such are " per se" which are inherent in the defini­ <lb/>
            tion of what a thing is: also those which are inherent in <lb/>
            their attributes in the definition declaring what a thing is; <lb/>
            also that which, on account of itself, is present with each <lb/>
            thing.</p>
          <p>4. Accidents are such as are inherent in neither way.</p>
          <p>5. A contrary is either privation or contradiction in the <lb/>
            same genus.</p>
          <p>6. “Universal” is that which is both predicated " of <lb/>
            every" and "per se," and "so far as the thing is:" these <lb/>
            two last expressions are equivalent. Universal is present <lb/>
            when it is demonstrated of any casual and primary thing.</p><pb n="667"/>
            
          <p>CHAP. V.—1. An error about the primary universal occurs, <lb/>
            as to demonstration, when either nothing can be assumed <lb/>
            higher, except the singular or singulars; or when some­ <lb/>
            thing else can be assumed, but it wants a specific name ; or <lb/>
            when it happens to be as a whole, in a part of which the <lb/>
            demonstration is made.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VI.—1. By a recapitulation it is proved, that the de­ <lb/>
            monstrative syllogism consists of certain propositions " per <lb/>
            se." The demonstrative syllogism is from necessary mat­ <lb/>
            ter, wherefore the sophists err, who think they assume <lb/>
            principles rightly, if the proposition be probable and true, <lb/>
            alleging that to know is to possess knowledge.</p>
          <p>2. Neither the probable nor the improbable is the princi. <lb/>
            ple, but that which is primary of the genus, about which <lb/>
            the demonstration is made. Not every thing true is appro­ <lb/>
            priate.</p>
          <p>3. If the conclusion be necessary, the premises need not <lb/>
            be so, but when the latter are so, the conclusion must be <lb/>
            necessary.</p>
          <p>4. Of accidents there is no demonstrative science: yet <lb/>
            the non-necessary is not to be neglected in disputation.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VII.—1. Three things are present in demonstrations; <lb/>
            viz. the demonstrated conclusion; axioms, i. e. those from <lb/>
            which the demonstration is made; and the subject genus <lb/>
            whose properties and essential accidents demonstration <lb/>
            makes manifest.</p>
          <p>2. The extremes and media must be of the same genus.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VIII.—1. There is no demonstration nor definition <lb/>
            "per se" of mutable natures, because the universal is non- <lb/>
            existent therein.</p>
          <p>CHAP. IX.—1. True demonstration only results from principles <lb/>
            appropriate to the subject of demonstration.</p>
          <p>2. The terms must be either homogeneous, or from two <lb/>
            genera of which one is contained in the other.</p>
          <p>3. The appropriate principles of each thing are them­ <lb/>
            selves incapable of demonstration: the science of them is <lb/>
            the mistress of all sciences.</p>
          <p>4. It is difficult to decide whether a thing is really <lb/>
            known or not; we think however that we know, if we have <lb/>
             <pb n="668"/>
            got a syllogism from certain primary truths, which however <lb/>
            is an error.</p>
          <p>CHAP. X.—1. Those are principles (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρχὰ</foreign>) in each genus <lb/>
            whose existence, it being impossible to demonstrate, must be <lb/>
            assumed.</p>
          <p>2. Of those employed in demonstrative sciences, some <lb/>
            are peculiar to each, others are common.</p>
          <p>3. Proper principles are those which are assumed to be.</p>
          <p>4. Of the three things with which all demonstration is <lb/>
            conversant, (vide vii. 1,) we sometimes neglect two.</p>
          <p>5. Neither hypothesis nor postulate need exist " per se," <lb/>
            nor be necessarily seen, since neither syllogism nor demon­ <lb/>
            stration belongs to external speech, but to what is in the soul.</p>
          <p>6. Postulate is any thing sub-contrary to the opinion of <lb/>
            the learner, which, though demonstrable, a man assumes, <lb/>
            and uses without demonstration.</p>
          <p>7. Definitions are not hypotheses, since they are not as­ <lb/>
            serted to be or not to be; hypotheses also are in proposi­ <lb/>
            tions, and definitions need only be understood.</p>
          <p>8. Hypotheses are those from the existence of which, in <lb/>
            that they are, the conclusion is produced.</p>
          <p>9. Postulate and hypothesis are either as a whole, or as <lb/>
            in a part, but definitions are neither of these.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XI.—1. It is not necessary for demonstration that there <lb/>
            should be forms (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔιδη</foreign>), or one certain thing besides the <lb/>
            many, yet one thing must be truly predicated of the many, <lb/>
            so that there must be an universal conception.</p>
          <p>2. In order to conclude, we assume the major proposition <lb/>
            to be true of the middle ; the middle may be assumed either <lb/>
            to be or not to be; similarly also the minor.</p>
          <p>3. The demonstration " ad impossible " assumes that of <lb/>
            every thing, affirmation or negation is true.</p>
          <p>4. All sciences communicate with each other, according <lb/>
            to common principles, i. e. those which men use as demon­ <lb/>
            strating from these, not those about which they demonstrate, <lb/>
            nor that which they demonstrate.</p>
          <p>5. Dialectic is common to all sciences, and conversant <lb/>
            with all subjects.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XII.—1. There is a certain scientific interrogation, from <lb/>
            which the syllogism, appropriate to each science, is drawn.</p><pb n="669"/>
            
          <p>2. He who possesses science is not to be interrogated <lb/>
            with every question, nor every question to be answered, <lb/>
            out those which are defined about the science.</p>
          <p>3. Some argue unsyllogisticaUy from assuming the con­ <lb/>
            sequences of both extremes.</p>
          <p>4. Mathematical demonstrations rarely prove the same by <lb/>
            many media.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XIII.—1. There is a two-fold difference if the syllogism <lb/>
            be not through things immediate; next, if it be, but not <lb/>
            through cause in the same science; wherefore this consti­ <lb/>
            stutes the fundamental distinction between the science, <lb/>
            " that" a thing is, and "why" it is.</p>
          <p>2. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅτιι</foreign>s demonstrated, where the media do not re­ <lb/>
            ciprocate, also where the middle is externally placed.</p>
          <p>3. There is a difference between a syllogism of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅτι</foreign> and <lb/>
            one of the " <foreign xml:lang="grc">διότι</foreign>,” in respect of each belonging to a different <lb/>
            science; moreover, the knowledge of the former belongs to <lb/>
            the perceptive, of the latter to the mathematical arguer.</p>
          <p>4. The superior sciences are essentially different from <lb/>
            their subject sciences, and use forms.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XIV.—1. The first figure is most suitable to science, for <lb/>
            the mathematical, and nearly all those sciences which in­ <lb/>
            vestigate the " why," demonstrate by this : the investigation <lb/>
            of the "why" constitutes the highest property of knowledge.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XV.—1. One thing may possibly not be individually <lb/>
            present with another, i. e. have no medium between them.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XVI.—1. Ignorance, according to disposition (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγνοια ἡ</foreign> <lb/>
            Kara <foreign xml:lang="grc">διάθεσιν</foreign>), is a deception through syllogism, occurrent <lb/>
            in two ways, in those things which are primarily present or <lb/>
            not present, viz. either by simple opinion or by syllogism.</p>
          <p>2. Of simple opinion the deception is simple; of that <lb/>
            which is through syllogism it is manifold.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XVII.—1. In cases which have no medium, both pro­ <lb/>
            positions cannot be false, but only the major, when decep­ <lb/>
            tion is produced.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XVIII.—1. Universals, from which demonstration pro­ <lb/>
            ceeds, depend upon induction, the latter upon sense.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XIX.—1. By those who syllogize according to opinion <lb/>
            only, and dialectically, it must be considered whether the <lb/>
             <pb n="670"/>
            syllogisms arise from propositions especially probable: as <lb/>
            to truth, we must observe from things inherent.</p>
          <p>2. If a stated series of terms or demonstrations proceed <lb/>
            . to infinity, there are no first principles, since these are in­ <lb/>
            demonstrable.</p>
          <p>3. In circular proofs, as in the circle itself, there is <lb/>
            nothing first or last.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XX.—1. If the predications, both downward and up­ <lb/>
            ward, stop, the media cannot be infinite.</p>
          <p>CHAP, XXI.—1. In negative demonstration there is not an in­ <lb/>
            finity of media in the several figures: since as progression <lb/>
            stops in cases of affirmation, so it must do also in negation.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XXII.—1. Of predications, as to what a thing is, there <lb/>
            cannot be infinity: it is to be understood that the predicate <lb/>
            is always spoken of its subject simply, and not accidentally, <lb/>
            and that it is enunciated of its subject with reference to <lb/>
            some one category. True predications either define their <lb/>
            subjects or are accidents.</p>
          <p>2. The theory of ideas is useless as to demonstration.</p>
          <p>3. That of which infinites are predicated, is indefinable.</p>
          <p>4. It is proved from the nature of category, that there <lb/>
            cannot be an infinite series.</p>
          <p>5. Propositions are not multiplied by the conjunction of <lb/>
            attributes.</p>
          <p>6. If there be infinity of predication, demonstration can­ <lb/>
            not exist, and this is also shown analytically from the na­ <lb/>
            ture of those things which are predicated <foreign xml:lang="grc">καθ̕̕</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὑτά</foreign>.</p>
          <p>CHAP, XXIII.—1. It follows from the above that one thing <lb/>
            may not be always inherent in another, according to some­ <lb/>
            thing common.</p>
          <p>2. Also that as there are certain indemonstrable principles <lb/>
            of affirmative, so there are certain such of negative demon­ <lb/>
            stration.</p>
          <p>3. In affirmative syllogisms nothing falls beyond the mid­ <lb/>
            dle: in negatives, in the first figure, nothing falls beyond <lb/>
            that which ought (not?) to be inherent.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XXIV.—1. Particular demonstration may appear pre­ <lb/>
            ferable to universal, because by the former we know ap­ <lb/>
            parently a thing per se, and therefore know it better; and <lb/>
             <lb/>
             <pb n="671"/>
            because universal is nothing else than particulars, is less <lb/>
            conversant with being, and produces false opinion.</p>
          <p>2. It is replied however to the above, that the preliminary <lb/>
            observation made in the last section is applicable to both <lb/>
            universal and particular, and that he who knows the uni­ <lb/>
            versal knows more of the absolute being present than he <lb/>
            who knows the particular ; moreover, that in the universal, <lb/>
            things are incorruptible, but particular more corruptible.</p>
          <p>3. Universal alone is cognizant of cause: hence the uni­ <lb/>
            versal demonstration is better.</p>
          <p>4. Particulars more nearly, universals less, approach in­ <lb/>
            finites : the latter therefore are more scientific.</p>
          <p>5. He who possesses the universal, has also the particular, <lb/>
            the former also comes closer in demonstration to the prin­ <lb/>
            ciple.</p>
          <p>6. The universal, moreover, is intuitively intelligible, but <lb/>
            the particular ends in sense.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XXV.—1. Affirmative is better than negative demon­ <lb/>
            stration, since that is the better demonstration “cæteris <lb/>
            paribus " which is through fewer postulates.</p>
          <p>2. The negative requires the affirmative, but the latter <lb/>
            does not need the former: also the latter (affirmative) comes <lb/>
            nearer to the nature of a principle.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XXVI.—1. Since affirmative is better than negative <lb/>
            demonstration, it is also evidently superior to the demon­ <lb/>
            stration " ad impossibile."</p>
          <p>CHAP. XXVII.—1. One science is more subtle and accurate <lb/>
            than another, e. g. " that a thing is," and " why it is," but <lb/>
            not separately that it is," than why it is:" also that <lb/>
            which is not of a subject, than that which is of a subject: <lb/>
            and that which consists of fewer things, than that which is <lb/>
            from addition.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XXVIII.—1. Whatever things are demonstrated from <lb/>
            principles of a common genus, these constitute one science.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XXIX.—1. The same thing may be demonstrable in <lb/>
            many modes, both when the middles are taken from the <lb/>
            same and from a different genus.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XXX.—1. There is no science of the fortuitous, which <lb/>
            is neither as necessary, nor as for the most part, but what <lb/>
             <pb n="672"/>
            is produced besides; hence it is inconsistent with demon­ <lb/>
            stration, the latter being one of these.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XXXI.—1. We do not possess scientific knowledge <lb/>
            through sensation, neither is sense science, though they are <lb/>
            employed about the same things, for sense apprehends par­ <lb/>
            ticularly, science universally.</p>
          <p>2. The universal exceeds the scope of sensuous percep­ <lb/>
            tion as to its ascertainment, the perception of the senses <lb/>
            being limited by time and place, while science is not so <lb/>
            restricted.</p>
          <p>3. Nevertheless, certain things are unknown from a de­ <lb/>
            ficiency of sensible perception.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XXXII.—1. It is impossible that there should be the <lb/>
            same principles of all syllogisms, since neither are there the <lb/>
            same of even all the true conclusions: principles are not <lb/>
            much fewer than conclusions, which latter are infinite: <lb/>
            moreover, some principles are from necessity, others con­ <lb/>
            tingent.</p>
          <p>2. To demonstrate any thing from all things, is not the <lb/>
            same with investigating whether there are the same princi­ <lb/>
            ples of all.</p>
          <p>3. Principles are two-fold (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξ ὧν</foreign>) and (<foreign xml:lang="grc">περὶ ὅ</foreign>).</p>
          <p>CHAP. XXXIII.—1. A difference between science and opinion <lb/>
            consists in the former being universal and subsisting through <lb/>
            things necessary; the principle of science is intellect, be­ <lb/>
            cause of our cognizance of axioms by it; opinion, on the <lb/>
            contrary, is conversant with the non-necessary.</p>
          <p>2. Both he who knows, and he who opines, follow <lb/>
            through media, to the immediate.</p>
          <p>3. Science and opinion are not conversant with the same <lb/>
            subject altogether, the subject of the one being certain, of <lb/>
            the other uncertain.</p>
          <p>4. We cannot at one and the same time both know and <lb/>
            opine, i. e. the same man cannot.</p>
          <p>5. The distinction between discourse, intellect, science, <lb/>
            art, prudence, wisdom, belongs partly to the physical, <lb/>
            partly to the ethical, theory.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XXXIV.—1. Sagacity (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγχίνοία</foreign>) is defined to be a cer­ <lb/>
            tain happy extempore conjecture of the middle term.</p><pb n="673"/>

            <title type="sub">BOOK II.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>CHAP. I.—1. THE subjects of scientific investigation are four, <lb/>
            viz. "that a thing is;" "why it is;" "if it is;" "what <lb/>
            it is.,,</p>
          <p>CHAP. 11.—1. The preceding four investigations may be re­ <lb/>
            duced to two, concerning the middle term, if there be one, <lb/>
            and what it is.</p>
          <p>2. The middle is that which expresses the cause why the <lb/>
            major is predicated of the minor.</p>
          <p>3. We do not however investigate the middle, if the thing <lb/>
            itself and its cause fall within the cognizance of our senses.</p>
          <p>CHAP. III.—1. Upon the difference existent between demon­ <lb/>
            stration and definition, it may be observed that we cannot <lb/>
            know by the latter every subject capable of the former, nor <lb/>
            by demonstration every thing capable of definition ; in fact, <lb/>
            nothing capable of definition admits demonstration.</p>
          <p>2. One part of a definition is not predicated of another.</p>
          <p>3. Definition shows what a thing is, but demonstration <lb/>
            that this is or is not of this: briefly, we cannot have both <lb/>
            of the same thing.</p>
          <p>CHAP. IV.—1. In order to collect syllogistically what a thing <lb/>
            is, the middle term should express the definition : he indeed <lb/>
            who proves the definition by syllogism, begs the question.</p>
          <p>CHAP. V.—1. The method by divisions does not infer a con­ <lb/>
            clusion, neither does he demonstrate who forms an induction.</p>
          <p>2. By constant division, when a perfect definition is ar­ <lb/>
            rived at, we are said to arrive at the individual.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VI.—1. There is no demonstration of the definition, <lb/>
            neither if one proposition defines the definition itself, nor <lb/>
            by any other hypothetical syllogism.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VII.—1. By an inquiry into the method of concluding <lb/>
            definition, it is shown that neither are syllogism and de­ <lb/>
            finition the same, nor of the same thing; also that definition <lb/>
            does not demonstrate a thing, and that we can know what a <lb/>
            thing is, neither by definition nor by demonstration.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VIII.—1. By an examination of the logical syllogism of <lb/>
            what a thing is, it is proved that of what a thing is there is <note type="footnote"> 2 x </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="674"/>
            neither a syllogism nor demonstration, but it is manifested <lb/>
            by both.</p>
          <p>2. To know what a thing is and to know its cause, are <lb/>
            the same.</p>
          <p>3. If the cause be different from the essence of which it <lb/>
            is the cause, and be capable of demonstration, the cause must <lb/>
            of necessity be a medium, and be demonstrated in the first <lb/>
            figure.</p>
          <p>4. Whatever we know accidentally that they are, we <lb/>
            need not possess any means of knowing what they are.</p>
          <p>CHAP. IX.—1. There are certain natures incapable of demon­ <lb/>
            stration, hence their existence and what they are" must <lb/>
            be manifested after a different manner, e. g. by induction: <lb/>
            of those which have a cause different from themselves, we <lb/>
            may produce a manifestation by demonstration, yet not by <lb/>
            demonstrating what they are.</p>
          <p>CHAP. X.—1. Definition being said to be a sentence explana­ <lb/>
            tory of " what a thing is," one kind of it will be of what a <lb/>
            name signifies, or another nominal sentence: hence defini­ <lb/>
            tion either explains the name of a thing or shows its cause ; <lb/>
            in the one case, there is signification without demonstration, <lb/>
            in the other a demonstration of what a thing is, differing <lb/>
            however from demonstration in the position of the terms; <lb/>
            wherefore,</p>
          <p>2. One definition is an indemonstrable sentence, signifi­ <lb/>
            cative of essence: another, a syllogism of essence differing <lb/>
            from demonstration in case; a third, is the conclusion of <lb/>
            the demonstration of what a thing is.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XI.—1. There are four causes of things, which are all <lb/>
            expressed by the middle term, viz. the formal, the material, <lb/>
            the efficient, and the final cause.</p>
          <p>2. The same thing may sometimes possess two causes: <lb/>
            so nature produces one thing for the sake of something, and <lb/>
            another from necessity.</p>
          <p>3. Necessity also is two-fold, one according to nature and <lb/>
            impulse (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁρμὴ</foreign>), another with violence contrary to impulse.</p>
          <p>4. In things from reason, some never subsist from chance, <lb/>
            nor from necessity, whilst others are from fortune; from <lb/>
            this last, nothing is produced for the sake of something.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XII.—1. As to the causes of the present, past, and <lb/>
             <pb n="675"/>
            future, it is observable that causes and effects are properly <lb/>
            simultaneous, and the posterior is not collected from the <lb/>
            prior. The medium also must be simultaneous with those <lb/>
            of which it is the medium.</p>
          <p>2. In the cases of past and future, some principle or first <lb/>
            must be taken; and of things which are not universally, but <lb/>
            usually, the principles should be non-necessary, yet for the <lb/>
            most part true.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XIII.—1. In investigation of definition, we must notice <lb/>
            a division of things as to extension, since some which are <lb/>
            always present with each individual, extend more widely, <lb/>
            yet not beyond the genus of the subject: by wider exten­ <lb/>
            sion is meant, that some are present with each individual <lb/>
            universally, yet also with another thing.</p>
          <p>2. To attain definition, such must be taken as are each <lb/>
            severally of wider extension than, yet all together equal to, <lb/>
            the thing to be defined.</p>
          <p>3. In investigating the definition of a subaltern species, <lb/>
            we should divide the genus into the individuals which are <lb/>
            first in species, then endeavour to assume the definitions <lb/>
            of these, next assuming in what category the thing defined <lb/>
            is contained, examine the peculiar passions of the first <lb/>
            species through principles common to the first and remain­ <lb/>
            ing lowest species.</p>
          <p>4. Differential division is useful to the above process, but <lb/>
            attention must be paid to whether the predicate be applied <lb/>
            prior or posterior.</p>
          <p>5. Nevertheless, it is not requisite that he who defines <lb/>
            should know all other subjects, from which he distinguishes <lb/>
            the thing defined.</p>
          <p>6. In divisional definition we must attend to three things, <lb/>
            viz. assume the things predicated in respect of what a <lb/>
            thing is ; arrange these as to first and second; and notice <lb/>
            that these are all.</p>
          <p>7. We must in our process, regard those which are simi­ <lb/>
            lar, and do not differ, considering their point of similarity, <lb/>
            then again, in those generically the same with them, until <lb/>
            we arrive at one reason, which will be the definition of the <lb/>
            thing.</p>
          <p>8. If we do not arrive at one, but at two or more, the <lb/>
            question will not be one, but many. <note type="footnote"> 2x2 </note></p><pb n="676"/>
            
          <p>9. Every definition is universal, but the especially uni­ <lb/>
            versal is most difficult to be defined.</p>
          <p>10. Perspicuity is particularly necessary in definition, <lb/>
            wherefore metaphors are not to be employed in it.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XIV.—1. Division is necessary, in order rightly to ap­ <lb/>
            propriate problems to each science; first, by the common <lb/>
            properties of the genus, then by those of the first species, <lb/>
            also if there be any thing common without a name, we <lb/>
            must yet assume it, in order to investigate its properties, <lb/>
            see to what species it is attributed, and the quality of the <lb/>
            things consequent to the anonymous genus. There is, <lb/>
            lastly, another mode, viz. by analogy, i. e. to assume a com­ <lb/>
            mon analogous thing.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XV.—1. Problems are identical, which have either the <lb/>
            same middle term, or of which the one is subject to the other.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XVI.—1. It may be doubted whether when the effect <lb/>
            is inherent, the cause is also; this difficulty is solved by <lb/>
            the rule, that the middle term should always express the <lb/>
            cause of the inference.</p>
          <p>2. There is only one cause of one and the same thing, <lb/>
            from which it is inferred.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XVII.—1. If the same thing be predicated of many, <lb/>
            except there is an accidental demonstration, it must be <lb/>
            shown from the same cause.</p>
          <p>2. If the conclusion is equivocal, the middle term will <lb/>
            be so.</p>
          <p>3. Things analogically the same will have also the same <lb/>
            medium by analogy.</p>
          <p>4. The major term ought to equal the minor in extent, <lb/>
            although it ought to exceed the individuals comprehended.</p>
          <p>5. If the same be predicated of things specifically differ­ <lb/>
            ent, it can be demonstrated by diverse middle terms.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XVIII.—1. Upon cause to singulars, observe that the <lb/>
            middle term ought to be the nearest to the singular, to <lb/>
            which it is cause.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XIX.—1. In reply to the questions whether the know­ <lb/>
            ledge of immediate principles be the same or not, with a <lb/>
            knowledge of the conclusion: also whether there is a sci­ <lb/>
            ence of each, or a varied science of either; lastly, whether <lb/>
             <pb n="677"/>
            non-inherent habits are acquired, or when inherent are <lb/>
            latent, the following observations may be adduced.</p>
          <p>2. The habit of principles can neither be possessed nor <lb/>
            ingenerated in the ignorant, and in those who have no habit, <lb/>
            wherefore it is necessary to possess a certain power.</p>
          <p>3. An innate power, called sensible perception, is inhe­ <lb/>
            rent in all animals.</p>
          <p>4. Sense being inherent in some, a permanency of the <lb/>
            sensible object is engendered, but in others it is not; the <lb/>
            latter have no knowledge without sensible perception, but <lb/>
            others perceiving, retain one certain thing in the soul.</p>
          <p>5. Hence it follows that with some, reason is produced <lb/>
            from the permanency of such things, in others it is not.</p>
          <p>6. From sense, memory is produced, and from repeated <lb/>
            remembrance of the same thing we get experience, and from <lb/>
            experience, the principle of art and science arises, of art, if <lb/>
            it be conversant with things perishable, but if with being, <lb/>
            of science.</p>
          <p>7. Definite habits are neither inherent nor produced from <lb/>
            other habits more known, but from sensible perception.</p>
          <p>8. The soul can retain many successive images: the uni­ <lb/>
            versal first exists in it, when one thing without difference <lb/>
            abides; primary things however become known to us by <lb/>
            induction, so that thus the universal is produced by sensi­ <lb/>
            ble perception.</p>
          <p>9. Of the habits conversant with intellect by which we <lb/>
            ascertain truth, some are always true, as science and intel­ <lb/>
            lect, others admit the false, as opinion and reasoning: intel­ <lb/>
            lect is the only kind of knowledge more accurate than science.</p>
          <p>10. Intellect alone is conversant with, and itself the prin­ <lb/>
            ciple of, science ; moreover, all science through demonstra­ <lb/>
            tion knows the objects of science.</p>

          <p>INTRoDUCTORy.-THE object and title of the Topics have <lb/>
            been so fully expounded in the note appended to the opening <lb/>
             <pb n="678"/>
            chapter, in the body of this work, that a brief summary here <lb/>
            of the chief divisions will suffice.</p>
          <p>The professed design is " to show a method by which a man <lb/>
            may be able to reason with probability and consistency upon <lb/>
            every question that can occur." Now every question either <lb/>
            concerns the genus of the subject, its specific difference, some­ <lb/>
            thing proper, or something accidental to it. Moreover, dia­ <lb/>
            lectic argument may be reduced either, first, to probable pro­ <lb/>
            positions suitable to an argument upon occasion ; secondly, to <lb/>
            distinctions of words nearly of the same signification; thirdly, <lb/>
            to distinction of things so far allied as that they may be mis­ <lb/>
            taken for identical; fourthly, to similitudes. The first book <lb/>
            therefore treats of the design of this treatise, the distinction <lb/>
            between the different syllogisms, propositions, categories, and <lb/>
            the various predication of the word "same;" also of dia­ <lb/>
            lectic, problem, and thesis, with the means adapted to the <lb/>
            provision of syllogisms, inductions, and propositions ; the <lb/>
            purport of the subsequent books will be successively pre­ <lb/>
            fixed to each. It is well remarked by Dr. Reid, that though <lb/>
            in the enumeration of Topics, Aristotle has shown more the <lb/>
            fertility of genius than the accuracy of method, yet he has <lb/>
            furnished the materials from which Cicero, Quintilian, and <lb/>
            other rhetorical writers have borrowed their doctrine of <lb/>
            " Loci."</p>
          <p>CHAP. I.—1. The purpose of this treatise is to discover a <lb/>
            method, by which we shall be able to syllogize about every <lb/>
            proposed problem from probabilities, and that when we our­ <lb/>
            selves sustain the argument, we may assert nothing re­ <lb/>
            pugnant. As a preliminary then, it is necessary to declare <lb/>
            the nature and differences of syllogism, in order to appre­ <lb/>
            .hend the dialectic syllogism which is investigated in the <lb/>
            following treatise.</p>
          <p>2. A syllogism is a discourse in which certain things <lb/>
            being laid down, something different from the posita hap­ <lb/>
            pens from necessity through the things laid down.</p>
          <p>3. Demonstration is when a syllogism consists of things <lb/>
            true and primary, or of such as assume the principle of the <lb/>
            knowledge concerning them through certain things primary <lb/>
            and true, i. e. such as obtain belief, not through others, but <lb/>
            through themselves.</p><pb n="679"/>
            
          <p>4. The dialectic syllogism is that which is collected from <lb/>
            probabilities.</p>
          <p>5. Probabilities are those which appear to all, or to most <lb/>
            men, or to the wise, and to these either to all or to the <lb/>
            greater number, or to such as are especially renowned or <lb/>
            illustrious.</p>
          <p>6. A contentious syllogism is one constructed from ap­ <lb/>
            parent but not real probabilities, and which appears to con­ <lb/>
            sist of probabilities, or of apparent probabilities.</p>
          <p>7. Paralogisms consist of things appropriate to certain <lb/>
            sciences, and are effected by making a syllogism from as­ <lb/>
            sumptions appropriate to science, yet not from the true.</p>
          <p>8. It is not intended in the following discourse to deliver <lb/>
            an accurate detail of these, but merely to run through them <lb/>
            briefly, it being deemed sufficient according to the proposed <lb/>
            method in some way to be able to know each of them.</p>
          <p>CHAP. II.—1. This treatise is usefully employed for exercise <lb/>
            conversation, and philosophical science ; for the first, because <lb/>
            we shall hence more easily argue upon every proposed <lb/>
            subject; for the second, because, having enumerated the <lb/>
            opinion of the many, we shall converse with, and confute <lb/>
            their errors, not from foreign, but from appropriate dogmas ; <lb/>
            and for the third, because, being able to dispute on both <lb/>
            sides, we shall more easily perceive in each the true and <lb/>
            the false. It is also applicable to the first principles of <lb/>
            each science, as it is the peculiarity of dialectic, from its <lb/>
            investigative character, to possess the way to the principles <lb/>
            of all methods.</p>
          <p>CHAP. III.—1. He is a skilful dialectician, who can effect a <lb/>
            selected purpose by the application of every possibility.</p>
          <p>CHAP. IV.—1. As to the particulars of this method, it is found <lb/>
            that the concomitants of arguments and of syllogisms are <lb/>
            equal and identical in number; arguments indeed being <lb/>
            constructed of propositions, and syllogisms being conversant <lb/>
            with problems.</p>
          <p>2. Every proposition and problem enunciates either ge­ <lb/>
            nus, property, accident, or definition ; difference, being ge­ <lb/>
            neric, is placed together with genus.</p>
          <p>3. Each of these per se is neither a problem nor a pro­ <lb/>
             <pb n="680"/>
            position ; moreover, problem and proposition differ in mode, <lb/>
            and from the latter you can make the former, by changing <lb/>
            the mode.</p>
          <p>CHAP. V.—1. Definition is a sentence signifying what a thing <lb/>
            is, and either a sentence is employed for a noun, or a sen­ <lb/>
            tence for a sentence, since we may define some things which <lb/>
            are signified by a sentence. Such, however, as in some <lb/>
            way or other make the explanation by a noun, do not ex­ <lb/>
            plain the definition of the thing, though we may refer these <lb/>
            to definition.</p>
          <p>2. Property is that which does not show what a thing is, <lb/>
            but is present to it alone, and reciprocates with it.</p>
          <p>3. Genus is what is predicated of many things different <lb/>
            in species, in answer to what a thing is, i. e. which is fitted <lb/>
            to answer the person inquiring what the thing is. It ought <lb/>
            also to be discussed by the same method as genus, whether <lb/>
            one thing is in the same or in a different genus with another.</p>
          <p>4. Accident is neither of the above, yet is present with <lb/>
            a thing. It is that also which may be so or not, this last <lb/>
            definition is the better, being self-sufficient for the know­ <lb/>
            ledge "per se" of what accident is.</p>
          <p>5. To accident, comparisons belong of things with each <lb/>
            other in whatever way they are derived from accident.</p>
          <p>6. Accident may sometimes and with reference to some­ <lb/>
            thing become property, though simply it is not so.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VI.—1. Whatever is advanced against genus, property, <lb/>
            and accident, is subversive of definition, but we must not <lb/>
            therefore on this account look for an universal method.</p>
          <p>JHAP. VII.—1. " Same" (TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταὐτὸν</foreign>) may appear to be divided <lb/>
            as to predication triply, viz. as to number, species, or genus ; <lb/>
            those however are especially called " same," which do not <lb/>
            differ in number, and this is attributed most properly in <lb/>
            name or definition; secondly, in property; thirdly, from <lb/>
            accident.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VIII.—1. It may be proved by induction and syllogism <lb/>
            that all questions belong to definition, genus, property, or <lb/>
            accident.</p>
          <p>CHAP. IX.—1. As the genera of the Categories are ten, so <lb/>
            the definition will always be in one of them.</p><pb n="681"/>
            
          <p>CHAP. X.—1. A dialectic proposition is an interrogation, pro­ <lb/>
            bable either to all, or to most, or to the wise. Dialectic <lb/>
            propositions also are both those which resemble the proba­ <lb/>
            ble, and which are contrary to those which appear probable, <lb/>
            being proposed through contradiction, and whatever opi­ <lb/>
            nions are according to the discovered arts.</p>
          <p>2. The probable, in comparison, will appear to be the <lb/>
            contrary about the contrary.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XI.—1. The dialectic problem is a theorem, (i. e. a <lb/>
            proposition whose truth is to be inquired into,) tending <lb/>
            either to choice and avoidance, or to truth and knowledge, <lb/>
            either per se, or as co-operative with something else of this <lb/>
            kind, about which the multitude either hold an opinion in <lb/>
            neither way, or in a way contrary to the wise, or the wise <lb/>
            to the multitude, or each of these to themselves.</p>
          <p>2. A thesis is a paradoxical judgment of some one cele­ <lb/>
            brated in philosophy, since to notice any casual person set­ <lb/>
            ting forth contrarieties to common opinion is absurd ; or a <lb/>
            thesis is an opinion of things, concerning which we have a <lb/>
            reason contrary to opinions.</p>
          <p>3. A thesis also is a problem, yet not every problem is a <lb/>
            thesis, since some problems we can form an opinion about in <lb/>
            neither way ; almost all dialectical problems are called theses; <lb/>
            neither, however, need be here severally considered.</p>
          <p>4. We need not discuss those things of which the demon­ <lb/>
            stration is at hand, nor those of which it is very remote.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XII.—1. In distinguishing how many species of dia­ <lb/>
            lectic arguments there are, it is observed that one is induc­ <lb/>
            tion, but the other syllogism, and the latter having been <lb/>
            described before (top. ch. i.) the former (induction) is here <lb/>
            defined to be a progression from singulars to universals. <lb/>
            It is also more persuasive, clearer, more known according <lb/>
            to sense, and common to many things: syllogism, on the <lb/>
            other hand, is more cogent and efficient against opponents <lb/>
            in disputation.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XIII.—1. The instruments by which we abound in syl­ <lb/>
            logisms are four, viz. 1st, To assume propositions; 2nd, To <lb/>
            be able to distinguish in how many ways each thing is pre­ <lb/>
            dicated ; 3rd, To discover differences; 4th, The considera­ <lb/>
            tion of the similar.</p><pb n="682"/>
            
          <p>2. In a certain way there are three propositions fron <lb/>
            these; i. e. distinction of what is predicated in many ways ; <lb/>
            the discovery of difference; the examination of similarity.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XIV.—1. Propositions must be selected in as many <lb/>
            ways as there has been difference about proposition, pro­ <lb/>
            posing contradictorily those which are contrary to the ap­ <lb/>
            parently probable, and selecting not only the probable, but <lb/>
            those also which resemble these.</p>
          <p>2. We must take as principle and as apparent thesis, <lb/>
            whatever is seen in all or in most things.</p>
          <p>3. We must select from written arguments, but descrip­ <lb/>
            tions must be made supposing separately about each genus.</p>
          <p>4. The several opinions also are to be noted, of celebrated <lb/>
            men.</p>
          <p>5. Comprehensively there are three parts of propositions <lb/>
            and of problems, viz. ethical, physical, and logical: it is not <lb/>
            easy to define what the quality of each is, but we must learn <lb/>
            their distinctive character by habit, arising from induction.</p>
          <p>6. As to philosophy, these propositions must be discussed <lb/>
            according to truth ; but as to opinion, dialectically.</p>
          <p>7. Propositions must be assumed as universal as possible, <lb/>
            many singulars being made one universal, subsequently <lb/>
            employing division, as far as possible.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XV.—1. The disputant should be acquainted with the <lb/>
            various significations of a word, and the reason of them.</p>
          <p>2. Ambiguity must be discovered from the diversity of <lb/>
            contraries.</p>
          <p>3. In some cases there is no dissonance in names, but <lb/>
            their difference is at once palpable in species.</p>
          <p>4. We must consider if there be any thing contrary to <lb/>
            the one, but nothing simply to the other.</p>
          <p>5. We must also consider the media, whether there is a <lb/>
            certain medium of some, but not of others ; or whether there <lb/>
            is of both, yet not the same.</p>
          <p>6. Moreover, if there is various predication in the con­ <lb/>
            tradictory.</p>
          <p>7. We must also notice the same in those predicated <lb/>
            according to privation and habit.</p>
          <p>8. Also whether there is any ambiguity in case.</p>
          <p>9. Whether the word belongs to the same category.</p><pb n="683"/>
            
          <p>10. Consider also the genera of those under the same <lb/>
            name, whether different and not subaltern.</p>
          <p>11. If the contrary is variously predicated, the proposi­ <lb/>
            tion also will be, hence the former must be regarded.</p>
          <p>12. Examine the definitions of the composite.</p>
          <p>13. Also the definitions themselves.</p>
          <p>14. Whether comparison subsists as to the more cr <lb/>
            similar.</p>
          <p>15. Whether those under the same name are the differ­ <lb/>
            ences of different and not subaltern genera.</p>
          <p>16. Whether of those under the same name there are <lb/>
            divers differences.</p>
          <p>17. Whether of those under the same name, one is spe­ <lb/>
            cies, but the other difference.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XVI.—1. The differences of genera themselves are to <lb/>
            be observed with respect to each other.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XVII.—1. Similitude, in the case of things of different <lb/>
            genera, must be considered thus: as one thing is to another, <lb/>
            so is another to another; and as one thing in a certain <lb/>
            other thing, so is another in another.</p>
          <p>2. As to those things which are in the same genus, we <lb/>
            must observe whether something identical is present with all.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XVIII.—1. To have considered in how many ways a <lb/>
            thing may be predicated, is useful. 1st, For perspicuity. <lb/>
            2nd, For syllogistic construction against the thing itself, <lb/>
            and not merely against the name. 3rd, For avoidance of <lb/>
            paralogism against ourselves, and for the employment of it <lb/>
            against others: observe, arguing against a name must be <lb/>
            altogether avoided by dialecticians, unless the proposition <lb/>
            cannot otherwise be discussed by any one.</p>
          <p>2. Discovery of differences, is useful to form syllogisms <lb/>
            of the same and the different, and for the knowledge of <lb/>
            what each thing is.</p>
          <p>3. Speculation upon the similar, is useful for inductive <lb/>
            and hypothetical syllogisms, and for the statement of de­ <lb/>
            finitions.</p>
          <p>4. From the above statements, it is concluded that the <lb/>
            number of instruments by which we abound in syllogism is <lb/>
            correctly declared to be four, as given at ch. xiii.</p><pb n="684"/>

          <p>INTRODUCTORY.—THIS book relates to the conversion of <lb/>
            the accidental, to problematical errors, to places belonging to <lb/>
            name, genus, etc., and to affirmative and negative argument <lb/>
            relatively; also to contraries and similars, and to arguments <lb/>
            drawn from addition, and from what is simply.</p>
          <p>CHAP. I.—1. Problems are either universal or particular, and <lb/>
            to both of them those things are common which universally <lb/>
            construct and subvert; the universally subversive are to be <lb/>
            first discussed.</p>
          <p>2. It is most difficult to convert an appropriate appella­ <lb/>
            tion derived from accident, as to be inherent partly is pos­ <lb/>
            sible to accident only, and we must convert from definition, <lb/>
            proposition, and genus.</p>
          <p>3. There are two errors occurrent in problems, either <lb/>
            from false assertion, or a departure from the established <lb/>
            mode of speaking.</p>
          <p>CHAP. II.—1. Of the "places" belonging to problems of ac­ <lb/>
            cident, one is, to prove that has been assigned as accident <lb/>
            which is present in some other mode.</p>
          <p>2. Also to examine the subjects of predication, beginning <lb/>
            from firsts, as far as individuals: this place converts to con­ <lb/>
            firmation and refutation.</p>
          <p>3. To make definitions both of accident and its subject, <lb/>
            either of both severally or of one of them, then to observe <lb/>
            when any thing has been assumed as true which is not true <lb/>
            in the definitions: we must also assume definitions instead <lb/>
            of the names in definitions, not desisting until we arrive at <lb/>
            what is known.</p>
          <p>4. Change the problem into a proposition previous to <lb/>
            objecting to it, as the objection will be an argument against <lb/>
            the thesis.</p>
          <p>5. Define what kind of things we ought, and what we <lb/>
            ought not to denominate, as the multitude do, and this place <lb/>
            is useful for confirmation and subversion.</p>
          <p>CHAP. III.—1. If an ambiguity of expression escape our oppo­ <lb/>
            nent, we must employ the sense most adapted to our own <lb/>
            position.</p><pb n="685"/>
            
          <p>2. If it does not escape him, we must distinguish the <lb/>
            various senses of predication.</p>
          <p>3. Where there is not equivocation, yet in an cases the <lb/>
            different relative and actual senses have to be considered.</p>
          <p>CHAP. IV.—1. An intelligible name is to be adopted in the <lb/>
            place of an obscure one.</p>
          <p>2. To prove the presence of contraries, genus must be <lb/>
            regarded; the demonstration being from the genus con­ <lb/>
            cerning the species, and vice versa: the former place is <lb/>
            false for confirmation, but true for subversion ; the latter is <lb/>
            the reverse.</p>
          <p>3. Of what genus is predicated, some species will be, and <lb/>
            if no species is, no genus can be: hence if any position <lb/>
            denominated from genus be taken, we must consider its <lb/>
            specific possibility.</p>
          <p>4. Definitions of the subject matter must be examined.</p>
          <p>5. Also the consequences of the proposition subsisting <lb/>
            must be noticed by the subverter, and the confirmer must <lb/>
            remark to what the proposition will belong.</p>
          <p>6. Time is to be attended to, if it is any where dis­ <lb/>
            crepant.</p>
          <p>CHAP. V.—1. It is a sophistical place to draw off our oppo­ <lb/>
            nent to our own strong point, which topic is sometimes <lb/>
            really, sometimes apparently, at others neither really nor <lb/>
            apparently necessary: the last mode we must be cautious <lb/>
            about, as it seems foreign from dialectic.</p>
          <p>2. If the consequent be subverted, the original proposi­ <lb/>
            tion is, yet we must take care not to make a transition to <lb/>
            what is more difficult, as sometimes the consequent, at others <lb/>
            the proposition itself, is easier of subversion.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VI.—1. If one of two things concerning a matter be <lb/>
            predicated, the same argument comprehends both; i. e. in <lb/>
            those with which one thing alone can be present.</p>
          <p>2. We must argue by transferring the name to the mean­ <lb/>
            ing, as being more appropriate to assume, than as the name <lb/>
            is placed.</p>
          <p>3. A place is afforded for argument by distinction be­ <lb/>
            tween necessary, general, and casual subsistence, being in­ <lb/>
            stituted.</p><pb n="686"/>
            
          <p>4. Consider whether notions only nominally different be <lb/>
            stated as accidents to each other.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VII.—1. Of many propositions contrary to the same, <lb/>
            we assume that which especially suits our position; it is <lb/>
            to be remembered here, that contraries are united to each <lb/>
            other in six ways, but produce contrariety when united in <lb/>
            four; the two first conjunctions not producing contrariety, <lb/>
            which is effected only by the remaining ones.</p>
          <p>2. If any thing is contrary to accident, observe whether <lb/>
            it is present with what the accident is said to be present <lb/>
            with.</p>
          <p>3. Also whether any thing has been predicated, from <lb/>
            which existing, contraries follow: e. g. if ideas exist, they <lb/>
            will be both moved and be at rest, also be both sensible and <lb/>
            intelligible.</p>
          <p>4. Whether an accident to which there is a contrary, <lb/>
            takes the contrary also, which contains the accident; this <lb/>
            place is chiefly useful to the subverter.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VIII.—1. We must employ the four kinds of opposition, <lb/>
            so as to see whether if A follows B, non-A also follows <lb/>
            non-B.</p>
          <p>2. Also notice whether the contrary follows the contrary, <lb/>
            directly or inversely.</p>
          <p>3. In privations and habits we must make an examina­ <lb/>
            tion, as in contraries, but in privations the inverse does not <lb/>
            occur, but the consequence is necessarily direct.</p>
          <p>4. Relatives are to be used similarly to habit and priva­ <lb/>
            tion ; an objection which however appears fallacious may <lb/>
            perhaps be urged, that there need not be a consequence in <lb/>
            relatives.</p>
          <p>CHAP. IX.—1. What is proved of one derivative of the same <lb/>
            word, is proved at the same time of all.</p>
          <p>2. Things efficient and conservative are co-elementary <lb/>
            with their products.</p>
          <p>3. Remark whether the contrary is predicated of the <lb/>
            contrary, (vide ch. viii.,) for as a principle the contrary fol­ <lb/>
            lows the contrary.</p>
          <p>4. We must collect from the generation and corruption <lb/>
            of a thing, whether itself be good or bad.</p>
          <p>CHAP. X.—1. Observe whether similars are enunciated of <lb/>
             <pb n="687"/>
            similars, and what is predicated of the one, be also truly <lb/>
            said of the many.</p>
          <p>2. Arguments must be derived from the more and less, <lb/>
            of which there are four places:</p>
          <p>1. If the more follows the more.</p>
          <p>2. When one thing is predicated of two, if it is not pre­ <lb/>
            sent with the more probable to possess it, it will not be <lb/>
            with the less, and in the same way affirmatively if present <lb/>
            with the less, it will be with the more.</p>
          <p>3. When two things are predicated of one, if what ap­ <lb/>
            pears more present is not, neither will the less be ; or if the <lb/>
            less apparent be, a fortiori, the more apparent will be.</p>
          <p>4. When two are predicated of two, if the more ap­ <lb/>
            parently present with the one is not so, neither will the re­ <lb/>
            mainder be with the remainder; or if what appears less <lb/>
            present with the other is present, the remainder will be <lb/>
            with the remainder.</p>
          <p>3. Argument is derivable triply from similitude or anal­ <lb/>
            ogy, as in the cases of the more present.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XI.—1. If an addition is made affecting the quality, <lb/>
            what is added will partake of the same quality. This place <lb/>
            is useful in those cases wherein there happens to be an ex­ <lb/>
            cess of the more, but it does not convert for subversion.</p>
          <p>2. Whatever is predicated comparatively, will also be so <lb/>
            simply, yet neither is this place useful for subversion.</p>
          <p>3. What subsists at some time and place, and according <lb/>
            to something, is also possible simply; also as to the when <lb/>
            and the where, what is simply impossible is neither possible <lb/>
            as to any thing, nor any where, nor at any time.</p>

          <p>INTRODUCTORY.—THIS book refers to Topics connected <lb/>
            with the more eligible and the better.</p>
          <p>CHAP. I.—1. In the consideration of the eligible, we do not <lb/>
            notice things vastly diverse, but those which are near and <lb/>
            about the eligibility of which we doubt: the most excellent <lb/>
            is the most eligible.</p>
          <p>2. The more durable, the more certain, that which a <lb/>
            wise or good man would choose, or upright law, or the <lb/>
             <pb n="688"/>
            studious, or the scientific, or the greater number, or all <lb/>
            would prefer, such constitute the more eligible.</p>
          <p>3. Simply the more eligible is that which is according to <lb/>
            the better science, but to a certain one that which is accord­ <lb/>
            ing to his proper science.</p>
          <p>4. What is in genus is preferable to what is not in it.</p>
          <p>5. Also what is chosen for itself: and what is per se <lb/>
            to what is accidental. The cause also per se of good is <lb/>
            preferable to the accidental cause.</p>
          <p>6. What is simply good is more eligible than what is so <lb/>
            to a certain person.</p>
          <p>7. Also what is naturally good.</p>
          <p>8. Also what is present with the more honourable.</p>
          <p>9. Also the property of the better is preferable to that <lb/>
            of the worse.</p>
          <p>10. Also whatever is in the better or the prior.</p>
          <p>11. Also the end to the means.</p>
          <p>12. Also what more approximates to the end.</p>
          <p>13. The possible to the impossible, and when there are <lb/>
            two efficients, that of which the end is better: these how­ <lb/>
            ever we must consider from analogy.</p>
          <p>14. The more beautiful per se, and the more honourable <lb/>
            and praiseworthy.</p>
          <p>CHAP. II.—1. We must judge of the excellence of things by <lb/>
            their consequents positively and negatively. This investi­ <lb/>
            gation is two-fold, since it follows both the prior and pos­ <lb/>
            terior.</p>
          <p>2. More goods are preferable to fewer, either simply or <lb/>
            when some are inherent in others, viz. the fewer in the <lb/>
            more.</p>
          <p>3. A thing at its acme of potentiality is more eligible.</p>
          <p>4. Whatever is useful at all or at most times.</p>
          <p>5. What is sufficient of itself when all possess it.</p>
          <p>6. Arguments may be derived as to the more eligible <lb/>
            from corruptions, rejections, generations, assumptions, and <lb/>
            contraries.</p>
          <p>7. The nearer to the good is preferable; also the more <lb/>
            similar to it, and what is more similar to the better than <lb/>
            itself.</p>
          <p>8. Ascertain whether the similar exists in things more <lb/>
            ridiculous.</p><pb n="689"/>
            
          <p>9. Compare relative excellence of the object resembled, <lb/>
            since that will be better which more resembles the better.</p>
          <p>10. Examine if the resemblance to the better be in some­ <lb/>
            thing inferior.</p>
          <p>11. The more illustrious is preferable to that which is <lb/>
            less so.</p>
          <p>12. Also the more difficult.</p>
          <p>13. The less common.</p>
          <p>14. The less connected with evil.</p>
          <p>15. The best in the simply better.</p>
          <p>16. What our friends can share.</p>
          <p>17. What we would rather do for friends.</p>
          <p>18. Things from abundance are better than such as are <lb/>
            necessary, yet sometimes those which are better are not <lb/>
            also more eligible.</p>
          <p>19. What cannot be supplied by another is more eligible <lb/>
            than what can be.</p>
          <p>20. What we chiefly desire to be present to us.</p>
          <p>21. The absence of which we less reprove persons for <lb/>
            lamenting.</p>
          <p>CHAP. III.—1. Of things under the same species, that which <lb/>
            possesses its own proper virtue is preferable to that which <lb/>
            does not, but when both possess it, that which has it in a <lb/>
            greater degree.</p>
          <p>2. That whose presence produces good, or the greater <lb/>
            good.</p>
          <p>8. Judgment of the preferable is to be formed from <lb/>
            cases, uses, actions, and works, and these last from those of <lb/>
            which they are the cases, etc.</p>
          <p>4. The greater good of the same thing is preferable, or <lb/>
            if it is the good of the greater.</p>
          <p>5. If two things are preferable to a certain one, the more <lb/>
            eligible is preferable to the less so.</p>
          <p>6. Again, that of which the excess is more eligible.</p>
          <p>7. That which a man would rather procure through him­ <lb/>
            self, than what he procures through another.</p>
          <p>8. Judgment must be formed from additions, with care, <lb/>
            however, against the proposition of such things in which <lb/>
            what is common is employed.</p>
          <p>9. The same must be done from detraction,</p>
          <p>10. Also if one is eligible per Be, but the ether on ac- <note type="footnote">2 T </note> <lb/>

            count of estimation, i. e. such as if no one were conscious, <lb/>
            we should not endeavour to obtain.</p>
          <p>11. If one be eligible for both the last, but the other for <lb/>
            one only.</p>
          <p>12. The more honourable for its own sake is more eli­ <lb/>
            gible, i. e. that which, nothing else resulting, we should <lb/>
            rather prefer for its own sake.</p>
          <p>13. Notice in how many ways the eligible is predicated, <lb/>
            and " quorum gratia."</p>
          <p>14. What is desired is more eligible than what is indif­ <lb/>
            ferent.</p>
          <p>CHAP. IV.—1. The places last enumerated are useful for show­ <lb/>
            ing whatever is to be chosen or to be avoided.</p>
          <p>CHAP. V.—1. Places pre-eminently universal are to be as­ <lb/>
            sumed of the more and greater, as they will be useful for <lb/>
            more problems: we may render some more universal by <lb/>
            slightly changing the appellation.</p>
          <p>2. Causes also are to be distinguished.</p>
          <p>3. If of the same thing one is more, but another less such.</p>
          <p>4. A topic of this kind is derivable from addition.</p>
          <p>5. And from detraction.</p>
          <p>6. Things more unmixed with contraries are more such.</p>
          <p>7. Also what is more receptive of the definition.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VI.—1. If the problem be laid down partially, all the <lb/>
            above-mentioned universal places are useful, whether con­ <lb/>
            firmatory or subversive.</p>
          <p>2. Those places are especially suitable which are as­ <lb/>
            sumed from opposites, co-ordinates, and cases.</p>
          <p>3. A topic is derivable from the more, and the less, and <lb/>
            the similarly.</p>
          <p>4. We may subvert not only from another, but from the <lb/>
            same genus.</p>
          <p>5. Also from hypothesis.</p>
          <p>6. The indefinite can be subverted in one way only, but <lb/>
            confirmation is possible in two ways.</p>
          <p>7. When the thesis is definite, we may subvert in two <lb/>
            ways, or in three, or in four.</p>
          <p>8. We must attend to singulars as to things inherent; <lb/>
            also to genera, employing specific division.</p>
          <p>9. Besides, in what things we may define accident, we <lb/>
            must see if no one of these is present.</p><pb n="691"/>

          <p>INTRODUCTORY.—THIS book refers to the Topics of genus <lb/>
            and species, similitude, and relation.</p>
          <p>CHAP. I.—1. In considering topics relative to genus, we may <lb/>
            observe that the latter is deceptively assumed, if it applies <lb/>
            not to every thing in the same species with that of which it <lb/>
            is predicated.</p>
          <p>2. Notice whether it is predicated as accident, regarding <lb/>
            especially the definition of accident, if it concurs with the <lb/>
            stated genus.</p>
          <p>3. Also whether the genus and species are not in the <lb/>
            same category, since universally speaking, genus must be <lb/>
            under the same division as species.</p>
          <p>4. Whether the definition of species is predicated of <lb/>
            genus.</p>
          <p>5. If the genus is not predicated of what the species is.</p>
          <p>6. If what is contained in the genus is subject to no <lb/>
            species.</p>
          <p>7. If what is placed in genus is of wider extension than, <lb/>
            or equal to, the genus itself.</p>
          <p>8. If what are in the same species are not in the genus.</p>
          <p>CHAP. II.—1. Consider whether there is any other genus of <lb/>
            the assigned species, which neither comprehends the as­ <lb/>
            signed genus nor is under it.</p>
          <p>2. Examine the genus of the assigned genus, and always <lb/>
            the superior genus, whether all things are predicated of the <lb/>
            species, in reply to what a thing is.</p>
          <p>3. Whether the genus partakes of the species, either it­ <lb/>
            self or any of the superior genera.</p>
          <p>4. Whether the assigned genus is predicated of the same <lb/>
            as the species is predicated of, in reference to what a thing <lb/>
            is ; also whether all those things which are above the genus.</p>
          <p>5. Whether the definitions of the genera are predicated <lb/>
            of the species and its subjects.</p>
          <p>6. Whether difference has been assigned as a genus or <lb/>
            as a species.</p>
          <p>7. Whether genus is placed in species.</p>
          <p>8. Or whether difference is so placed.</p>
          <p>9 Whether genus is made subject to difference. <note type="footnote"> 2 Y 2 </note></p><pb n="692"/>
            
          <p>10. Or genus predicated as difference.</p>
          <p>11. Whether no difference of genera is predicated of <lb/>
            species.</p>
          <p>12. If species is naturally prior to the genus.</p>
          <p>13. Or the genus and difference are not necessarily joined <lb/>
            to the species.</p>
          <p>CHAP. III.—1. Genus is erroneously assigned, if its subject <lb/>
            partake either of some contrary to genus or of what cannor <lb/>
            be joined to it.</p>
          <p>2. Observe whether the species is equivocal with the genus.</p>
          <p>3. And if there be not another species of the proposed <lb/>
            genus.</p>
          <p>4. Observe also if genus has not been taken in its right <lb/>
            sense, but something proposed as genus, which is spoken of <lb/>
            metaphorically.</p>
          <p>5. Also if any contrary exist to species, which considera­ <lb/>
            tion is multifarious.</p>
          <p>6. The genus is rightly constituted if there be a contrary <lb/>
            to species.</p>
          <p>7. Both the subverter and confirmer must notice cases <lb/>
            and co-ordinates, whether they are similarly consequent.</p>
          <p>CHAP. IV.—1. Arguments may be obtained from similars.</p>
          <p>2. If privation be opposed to species, we may confute in <lb/>
            two ways: first, If the opposed be in the assigned genus ; <lb/>
            secondly, If privation be opposed both to genus and species, <lb/>
            but the thing opposed is not in the opposite, since neither <lb/>
            will the thing assigned be in the assigned.</p>
          <p>3. Negatives must be considered inversely, as in the case <lb/>
            of accident (vide b. ii. ch. 8).</p>
          <p>4. Of expression by relation, if species be relative, genus <lb/>
            also is, but not vice versâ.</p>
          <p>5. Notice whether species is not referred to the same <lb/>
            thing both per se and according to genus.</p>
          <p>6. Or according to all the genera of the genus.</p>
          <p>7. Whether genus and species are predicated in the same <lb/>
            manner as to case.</p>
          <p>8. Whether those similarly called relatives as to cases do <lb/>
            not alike reciprocate.</p>
          <p>9. In as many ways as species is referred to another <lb/>
            thing, in so many also ought genus to be, and vice versa.</p><pb n="693"/>
            
          <p>10. Notice whether the opposite is the genus of the op­ <lb/>
            posite.</p>
          <p>11. If genus and species are stated as related to some­ <lb/>
            thing, they ought to have the same ratio to those in which <lb/>
            they are inherent.</p>
          <p>CHAP. V.—1. The following errors are committed by some in <lb/>
            points relative to genus.</p>
          <p>1st, They refer habit to energy, or energy to habit.</p>
          <p>2nd, Or arrange habit under consequent power.</p>
          <p>3rd, Or admit as genus what is in some way consequent <lb/>
            to species.</p>
          <p>2. Genus and species ought to be inherent in the same <lb/>
            thing.</p>
          <p>3. Species ought to participate of genus " simply," not <lb/>
            it quodammodo."</p>
          <p>4. Sometimes by mistake men take a part of species for <lb/>
            genus.</p>
          <p>5. Notice if any thing culpable or to be avoided is re­ <lb/>
            ferred to power or to the possible.</p>
          <p>6. Or if any thing honourable " per se " is referred to <lb/>
            power or to the effective.</p>
          <p>7. An error is incident to those who assign genus as <lb/>
            difference, and vice versa.</p>
          <p>8. Also to such as make the thing affected the genus of <lb/>
            the affection.</p>
          <p>9. Or declare that of which there is passion to be the <lb/>
            genus of the passion.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VI.—1. Examine whether the proposed genus possesses <lb/>
            subject species.</p>
          <p>2. Whether also the consequent of all has been taken as <lb/>
            genus or difference.</p>
          <p>3. Whether the assigned genus is stated to be in the <lb/>
            subject species.</p>
          <p>4. Or whether genus and species are not synonymous.</p>
          <p>5. Error occurs if the better of two contraries be as­ <lb/>
            signed to the worse genus.</p>
          <p>6. The subverter may argue from the more and less, if <lb/>
            genus accepts the more, but species does not, neither itself, <lb/>
            nor what is enunciated according to it.</p>
          <p>7. If the more or similar be not genus, neither is that <lb/>
             <pb n="694"/>
            which is assigned. The above place is not useful to the <lb/>
            supporter, if the assigned genus and species accept the more, <lb/>
            yet the comparison of genera and species with each other <lb/>
            is useful.</p>
          <p>8. To establish genus, we must show that it compre­ <lb/>
            hends species with whose nature it concurs.</p>
          <p>9. Genus must be distinguished from difference, by em­ <lb/>
            ploying the elements mentioned in ch. ii.; first, because <lb/>
            genus is more widely extended than difference; next, be­ <lb/>
            cause genus is more suitable to enunciate, in answer to the <lb/>
            , question, " What a thing is;" thirdly, because the differ­ <lb/>
            ence always signifies the quality of the genus, but the genus <lb/>
            not that of the difference.</p>
          <p>10. The genus must be collected from the noun and its <lb/>
            derivatives.</p>
          <p>11. Examine whether one is a consequent to the other, <lb/>
            whilst the two do not reciprocate: the disputant must em­ <lb/>
            ploy this place, as if genus were that which is always con­ <lb/>
            sequent when the other does not reciprocate, but must <lb/>
            object to this argument if advanced by the other side.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>INTRODUCTORY.—THIS book consists of an examination <lb/>
            into whether what is asserted be, or be not, property.</p>
          <p>CHAP. I.—1. Property is assigned either "per se" and al­ <lb/>
            ways, or with reference to something and sometimes.</p>
          <p>2. The property assigned with reference to something <lb/>
            else, if it be affirmed of one thing, but the same denied of <lb/>
            another, produces two problems; but if each be affirmed and <lb/>
            denied of each, it will produce four problems.</p>
          <p>3. That is property " per se " which is attributed to all, <lb/>
            and separates from every thing.</p>
          <p>4. Property with relation to another is that which does <lb/>
            not separate from every thing, but from a certain definite <lb/>
            thing.</p>
          <p>5. Property "always" is what is true at all times and <lb/>
            never fails.</p>
          <p>6. Property "sometimes" is that which is true at a cer­ <lb/>
            tain time, yet does not always follow from necessity.</p><pb n="695"/>
            
          <p>7. Property may be assigned with reference to something <lb/>
            else, when difference is asserted to be either in all and al­ <lb/>
            ways, or for the most part and in most.</p>
          <p>8. Properties are especially logical, which are " per se," <lb/>
            and always, with reference to something else: that also is <lb/>
            a logical problem in reference to which, numerous and good <lb/>
            arguments may be framed.</p>
          <p>CHAP. II.—1. What constitutes a good exposition of property <lb/>
            is its being more evident than its subject.</p>
          <p>2. Assignment of property is subverted if there be some <lb/>
            name assigned in it, of multifarious predication, or if alto­ <lb/>
            gether the sentence signifies many things.</p>
          <p>3. Also if there is multifarious predication of the subject.</p>
          <p>4. Also if there be frequent repetition, which happens <lb/>
            either when we often denominate the same, or when any <lb/>
            one assumes definitions instead -of names.</p>
          <p>5. Also if that be in the property which is common to all.</p>
          <p>6. And if many properties are assigned of the same thing, <lb/>
            without distinction.</p>
          <p>CHAP. III.—1. The subverter must remark whether the thing <lb/>
            itself is contained in its assigned property.</p>
          <p>2. Also whether the opposite to the thing itself, or what <lb/>
            is less clear than the latter, be taken as the property, or in <lb/>
            short, what is naturally simultaneous or posterior.</p>
          <p>3. And whether that is assigned which is not always <lb/>
            joined to the thing.</p>
          <p>4. And whether the assignor of a present property does <lb/>
            not distinguish time.</p>
          <p>5. Whether what is only evident by sense, is assigned.</p>
          <p>6. Whether definition is assigned as property.</p>
          <p>7. Whether it does not necessarily consist with the very <lb/>
            nature of a thing.</p>
          <p>CHAP. IV.—1. As to the question whether the assigned be <lb/>
            property or not, it is observed that it is not so, if it does <lb/>
            not concur with every individual.</p>
          <p>2. Also if the name be not verified of what the sentence <lb/>
            is, and vice versa.</p>
          <p>3. And if the subject be assigned as the property.</p>
          <p>4. And if that is assigned as a property which the thing <lb/>
            partakes of, as a difference.</p><pb n="696"/>
            
          <p>5. Or if the property cannot be at the same time in­ <lb/>
            herent in, but either prior or posterior to, that of which it is <lb/>
            the name.</p>
          <p>6. Or if the same thing be not the property of the same <lb/>
            things, so far as they are the same.</p>
          <p>7. And if of things the same in species, the property is <lb/>
            not always specifically the same.</p>
          <p>8. It being difficult when “same” and “different” are <lb/>
            sophistically assumed, to assign the property of some one <lb/>
            thing alone, a person may object to many of these proper­ <lb/>
            ties, if he make one subject subsistent " per se,” but another <lb/>
            with accident. Still in confirming we must state that that <lb/>
            to which a thing happens and the accident, taken together <lb/>
            with that to which it is accidental, are not different simply, <lb/>
            but are said to be so from their essence being different. <lb/>
            Cases also are to be inspected.</p>
          <p>CHAP. V.—1. Observe whether for that which is always the <lb/>
            property, something be assumed which is joined to the very <lb/>
            nature of a thing.</p>
          <p>2. Whether that whose property is assigned be predi­ <lb/>
            cated of some other first, or another of itself as first.</p>
          <p>3. Whether the manner and subject of the property be <lb/>
            accurately defined, as either naturally inherent, or from <lb/>
            possession, participation, in species, and simply.</p>
          <p>4. Property is subverted, if a thing is assigned as the <lb/>
            property of itself.</p>
          <p>5. Observe whether in those things which consist of <lb/>
            similar parts, the property of a part or of the whole be <lb/>
            laid down.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VI.—1. Observe whether of opposites the properties be <lb/>
            opposite; of contraries, contrary.</p>
          <p>2. Observe whether one relative is not the property of <lb/>
            another relative.</p>
          <p>3. Property is subverted, if what is predicated accord­ <lb/>
            ing to habit is not the property of the habit.</p>
          <p>4. The subverter must consider a topic from affirmatives <lb/>
            and negatives, for if the one be predicated as property, the <lb/>
            other will not be property.</p>
          <p>5. Whether things non-repugnant be assigned as pro­ <lb/>
            perty of repugnant subjects.</p><pb n="697"/>
            
          <p>6. Whether the same property be assumed of things re­ <lb/>
            pugnant.</p>
          <p>7. Whether of things of the same division, properties are <lb/>
            assigned, so as not to keep the same order of division.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VII.—1. Property is subverted also, if case is not the <lb/>
            property of case; and if the case of the opposite is not the <lb/>
            property of the case of the opposite.</p>
          <p>2. Also if what subsists similarly is not the property of <lb/>
            what has similar subsistence.</p>
          <p>3. Also if what subsists after the same manner is not the <lb/>
            property of what subsists after the same manner.</p>
          <p>4. Also if what is said to exist is not the property of <lb/>
            what is said to exist, neither will to be corrupted be the <lb/>
            property of that which is said to be corrupted.</p>
          <p>5. Observe the idea of the thing proposed, subverting, if <lb/>
            it be not present with the idea.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VIII.—1. Whether property is rightly assigned is known <lb/>
            from things admitting degree.</p>
          <p>2. The subverter must consider whether the simply is <lb/>
            not the property of the simply, since neither will the more <lb/>
            be that of the more.</p>
          <p>3. If the more is not the property of the more, neither <lb/>
            will the less be the property of the less.</p>
          <p>4. It is subverted if it is not the property of which it is <lb/>
            more the property, as neither will it be the property of that <lb/>
            of which it is less the property.</p>
          <p>5. Also if what is more the property of the thing is not <lb/>
            its property, as neither will what is less so be its pro­ <lb/>
            perty.</p>
          <p>6. A topic of subversion arises, if what is similarly the <lb/>
            property is not the property of that of which it is similarly <lb/>
            the property.</p>
          <p>7. Also if what is similarly the property of a thing is <lb/>
            not its property.</p>
          <p>8. Also if it is not the property of what it is similarly <lb/>
            the property. A difference arises between the topic from <lb/>
            things similarly affected, and that from things similarly in­ <lb/>
            herent, inasmuch as the one is, and the other is not con­ <lb/>
            sidered, in respect ot something being inherent.</p>
          <p>CHAP. IX.—1. Property is subverted if assigned in capacity <lb/>
             <pb n="698"/>
            to that which is not, but it is confirmed if assigned to that <lb/>
            to which capacity may be present.</p>
          <p>2. It is subverted if it is placed in hyperbole.</p>

          <p>INTRoDUCTORy.-This book refers to places connected with <lb/>
            definition.</p>
          <p>CHAP. I.—1. Definition is subverted in five ways, viz. 1st, If <lb/>
            the sentence is declared to be predicated of what the name <lb/>
            is; 2nd, If the thing defined is not placed in its appropriate <lb/>
            genus; 3rd, If the sentence is not proper; 4th, If it does <lb/>
            not state the nature of the thing defined; 5tb, If it be not <lb/>
            defined well.</p>
          <p>2. Whether the sentence is not verified of what the name <lb/>
            is, must be observed from topics of accident.</p>
          <p>3. Whether the assigned definition is not in its proper <lb/>
            genus, or is not proper, must be observed from topics of <lb/>
            genus and property.</p>
          <p>4. The remaining inquiry is about proper definition, or <lb/>
            its subsistence at all.</p>
          <p>5. The question of defining erroneously is resolvable into <lb/>
            two parts: 1st, Whether obscurity is employed in the in­ <lb/>
            terpretation ; 2nd, Whether the definition is stated more <lb/>
            extensively than is requisite.</p>
          <p>CHAT. II.—1. The place appertaining to obscure definition is <lb/>
            if an equivocal statement be employed, or the thing defined <lb/>
            be equivocal.</p>
          <p>2. Also if it is spoken metaphorically.</p>
          <p>3. Also if in unusual terms.</p>
          <p>4. Also if an expression be used, not in its proper sense.</p>
          <p>5. Also if the contrary is not intelligible from it, or the <lb/>
            definition needs explanation.</p>
          <p>CHAP. III.—1. As to superfluity in definition, we must see <lb/>
            whether any thing is introduced which is present with all <lb/>
            things, or with those which are under the same genus with <lb/>
            the thing to be defined.</p>
          <p>2. Observe whether any part of the definition being ab­ <lb/>
            stracted, the remainder defines the thing.</p>
          <p>3. Moreover, whether there is any thing in the defini­ <lb/>
             <pb n="699"/>
            tion which cannot be predicated of all subjects of the same <lb/>
            species.</p>
          <p>4. Whether the same thing be stated frequently.</p>
          <p>5. Whether what is universally asserted, adds also some­ <lb/>
            thing particular.</p>
          <p>CHAP. IV.—1. In considering whether a person has defined <lb/>
            what a thing is or not, we may discover definition to be <lb/>
            false, if it be not through things prior to, and more known <lb/>
            than, the thing defined.</p>
          <p>. 2. To assume that definition is not framed through things <lb/>
            more known, is possible in two ways, either if it is simply <lb/>
            from things more unknown, or from those more unknown <lb/>
            to us: simply the prior is more known than the posterior, <lb/>
            but the reverse sometimes happens to us.</p>
          <p>3. A true definition is from things simply, and of them­ <lb/>
            selves more known: nevertheless, though simply, it is bet­ <lb/>
            ter to aim at the knowledge of things posterior, through <lb/>
            those which are prior, yet to persons incapable of knowledge <lb/>
            through such, it is sometimes necessary to define through <lb/>
            things known to them.</p>
          <p>4. The constant ought not to be defined by the inconstant.</p>
          <p>5. There are three modes of showing a definition to be <lb/>
            not from things prior: 1st, If the opposite be defined <lb/>
            through the opposite; 2nd, If the thing defined be used in <lb/>
            the definition; 3rd, If what is in an opposite division be <lb/>
            defined by what is in an opposite division.</p>
          <p>6. The superior must not be defined by the inferior.</p>
          <p>CHAP. V.—1. We must notice whether the genus of the thing <lb/>
            to be defined is omitted.</p>
          <p>2. Also if when the thing to be defined belongs to many <lb/>
            things, it is not adapted to all.</p>
          <p>3. It is erroneous in definition to refer the thing to the <lb/>
            worse, and not to the better.</p>
          <p>4. And not to place what is asserted in its proper genus.</p>
          <p>5. Also omitting proximate genus to propose remote and <lb/>
            superior genus.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VI.—1. Consider as to differences whether those of <lb/>
            genus are introduced, since it is an error in definition, not <lb/>
            to define by the proper differences of a thing.</p>
          <p>2. Observe whether any thing is divided oppositely to <lb/>
            the difference stated.</p><pb n="700"/>
            
          <p>3. Or if there be oppositely divided difference, which is <lb/>
            not verified of the genus.</p>
          <p>4. Or if it be verified, but the difference added to genus <lb/>
            does not produce species.</p>
          <p>5. It is an error to divide genus by negation; this place <lb/>
            is useful against the theory of ideas: a person may, how­ <lb/>
            ever, in some cases be obliged to use negation, as in priva­ <lb/>
            tions, yet it makes no difference whether we divide genus <lb/>
            by negation or by such an affirmation as to which it is <lb/>
            necessary that negation should be oppositely divided.</p>
          <p>6. Observe if species is assigned as difference.</p>
          <p>7. Or if genus be assigned as difference.</p>
          <p>8. Whether also the difference signifies this particular <lb/>
            thing.</p>
          <p>9. Or has the notion of accident.</p>
          <p>10. Or if difference or species be predicated of genus.</p>
          <p>11. Or genus of difference.</p>
          <p>12. Or species of difference.</p>
          <p>13. Whether also the same difference belongs to another <lb/>
            genus.</p>
          <p>14. Whether situation be assigned as the difference of <lb/>
            substance.</p>
          <p>15. Whether passion be assigned as difference.</p>
          <p>16. It is erroneous to assign the difference of a certain <lb/>
            relative, irrelatively to something else.</p>
          <p>17. Observe whether the relation be apt.</p>
          <p>18. Also whether the definition be of what is proximate.</p>
          <p>19. Whether that is receptive, of which the thing defined <lb/>
            is stated to be the passion or disposition.</p>
          <p>20. Whether the ratio of time concurs with the thing <lb/>
            defined.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VII.—1. Observe if any thing else better expresses the <lb/>
            nature of the thing to be defined, than the proposed definition.</p>
          <p>2. Whether the definition admits degrees, whilst the <lb/>
            thing defined does not, and vice versa.</p>
          <p>3. Whether both receive increase, yet not simultaneously.</p>
          <p>4. Whether when two things are proposed, of what the <lb/>
            thing defined is more predicated, that which is according <lb/>
            to definition is less predicated.</p>
          <p>5. Whether the one is similarly present with both, but <lb/>
            not the other.</p><pb n="701"/>
            
          <p>6. Whether the definition be adapted to several things <lb/>
            according to each.</p>
          <p>7. Whether there is any discrepancy in framing defini­ <lb/>
            tions of genera and differences.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VIII.—1. Observe if the defined be referred to some­ <lb/>
            thing, whether that to which it is referred has not been <lb/>
            mentioned.</p>
          <p>2. Whether a thing be referred to generation or energy.</p>
          <p>3. Whether respect be had to quantity, quality, place, etc.</p>
          <p>4. Whether in the definition of appetites, a notion of <lb/>
            things of like species be added.</p>
          <p>CHAP. IX.—1. Observe whether the definition of the contrary <lb/>
            or of the cognates of the thing defined can be attained from <lb/>
            the definition given.</p>
          <p>2. Whether if the genus is referred to any thing, the <lb/>
            species is referred to the species of the same.</p>
          <p>3. Whether there is an opposite definition of the opposite.</p>
          <p>4. Whether habit be defined by privation, or a contrary <lb/>
            by a contrary.</p>
          <p>5. Whether of what is privatively predicated, the subject <lb/>
            is not assigned.</p>
          <p>6. Whether that is defined by privation which is not <lb/>
            privatively predicated.</p>
          <p>CHAP. X.—1. Observe whether similar cases of the definition <lb/>
            agree with similar cases of the noun.</p>
          <p>2. Whether the definition accords to the idea.</p>
          <p>3. Whether in things predicated equivocally a person has <lb/>
            assigned one common definition of them all; for those are <lb/>
            synonymous, of which there is one definition, according to <lb/>
            the name, and the equivocal suits every thing similarly.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XI.—1. Observe whether of composites defined, the <lb/>
            individual members are rightly defined, the definition being <lb/>
            divided.</p>
          <p>2. Whether of a composite, the definition consists of as <lb/>
            many members as the thing defined.</p>
          <p>3. He errs who makes a change in definition, for names <lb/>
            .nore unknown.</p>
          <p>4. Observe in the change of names, whether a person <lb/>
            does not signify still the same thing.</p><pb n="702"/>
            
          <p>5. Whether in changing one of the names, a person <lb/>
            changes not the difference, but the genus.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XII.—1. The definition of difference being assigned, <lb/>
            observe whether the assigned difference is common to any <lb/>
            thing else.</p>
          <p>2. Whether what is defined be existent, but what is ex­ <lb/>
            pressed by the assigned definition be non-existent.</p>
          <p>3. Whether in the definition of a relative, that to which <lb/>
            the notion to be defined refers, is of too wide extension.</p>
          <p>4. Whether the definition be assigned "non rei ipsius," <lb/>
            sed "rei perfectæ.”</p>
          <p>5. Whether what is eligible "per se” is defined as <lb/>
            though eligible " propter aliud."</p>
          <p>CHAP. XIII.—1. Observe whether he who assigns the defini­ <lb/>
            tion of a certain thing, defines it as " these" things, or as <lb/>
            that which consists of “these,” or "this together with <lb/>
            that;" for whatever arguments may be adduced to prove <lb/>
            the parts and the whole not identical, are useful, but those <lb/>
            are especially appropriate in whatever the composition of <lb/>
            the parts is evident.</p>
          <p>2. If he defines the thing as not these, but something <lb/>
            consisting of these (hoc ex illis), examine whether one cer­ <lb/>
            tain thing is not naturally adapted to be produced from these.</p>
          <p>3. Also whether the thing defined is naturally adapted <lb/>
            to be in some one first, but those of which it is stated to <lb/>
            consist, are not in some one first, but each in the other.</p>
          <p>4. Or if the parts and the whole are in one first, whether <lb/>
            they are not in the same, but the whole in one, and the <lb/>
            parts in another.</p>
          <p>5. Also whether the parts are destroyed together with <lb/>
            the whole.</p>
          <p>6. Or whether the whole be good or evil, but the parts <lb/>
            neither, or vice versâ.</p>
          <p>7. Or whether the one be more good than the other is <lb/>
            evil, but what consists of these be not more good than evil.</p>
          <p>8. Observe whether it be stated to consist of the better <lb/>
            and the worse, of which the whole is not worse than the <lb/>
            better, but is better than the worse, though it is question­ <lb/>
            able if this be necessary, unless those be of themselves good. <lb/>
            of which the thing consists.</p><pb n="703"/>
            
          <p>9. Whether the whole be synonymous with the other <lb/>
            part, which it ought not to be.</p>
          <p>10. Whether the mode of composition has been explained.</p>
          <p>11. If “this” thing is assigned with that" (“hoc cum <lb/>
            illo "), we must first state that this is with that, or is the <lb/>
            same with these, or because this is from those.</p>
          <p>12. Distinguishing in how many ways one thing is said <lb/>
            to be with another, observe whether this be in no way <lb/>
            with that.</p>
          <p>13. When distinction is made, if it is true that each is <lb/>
            in the same time, observe whether it is possible that each <lb/>
            may not be referred to the same thing.</p>
          <p>14. Some cases indeed do not fall under the division <lb/>
            mentioned, but constitute exceptions.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XIV.—1. Observe whether in stating a composite, the <lb/>
            definer has not added the quality of the compound.</p>
          <p>2. He errs, who defines through one contrary alone, that <lb/>
            which is capable of both.</p>
          <p>3. If the whole definition is unassailable by a person, <lb/>
            from the whole not being known, he must attack some <lb/>
            part known, but apparently ill assigned.</p>
          <p>4. This is necessary also, to correct and reform obscure <lb/>
            definitions, in order to obtain an argument by rendering <lb/>
            something evident; since the respondent must either admit <lb/>
            what is taken up by the querist, or himself discover what <lb/>
            the definition signifies.</p>
          <p>5. As bad laws are abrogated for better, so good defini­ <lb/>
            tions must be substituted for bad.</p>
          <p>6. It is useful to define with oneself sagaciously the pro­ <lb/>
            position, or assume a definition which has been well framed.</p>

          <p>INTRODUCTORY.—THIS book refers to the question of iden­ <lb/>
            tity, also to places which confirm or subvert definition.</p>
          <p>CHAP. I.—1. Identity must be considered from cases, co-ordi­ <lb/>
            nates, and opposites, for if one be the same with a thing, the <lb/>
            other will be, and of opposites the opposites are the same.</p>
          <p>2. Observe whether of those of which one is especially <lb/>
            said to be a certain thing, another also is especially predi­ <lb/>
             <pb n="704"/>
            cated according to the same: note that each of those things <lb/>
            which are said to be the greatest or the most eligible, must <lb/>
            be one in number, if we would show that it is the same. <lb/>
            Xenocrates errs in this omission, as to proving the identity <lb/>
            of a happy and a worthy life.</p>
          <p>3. Observe whether one of the things proposed is the <lb/>
            same as a third thing, also whether another is the same <lb/>
            with it, for if both are not the same with it, they are not <lb/>
            identical with each other.</p>
          <p>4. Observe from the accidents of these and from those <lb/>
            things to which these are accidents, if there be any discre­ <lb/>
            pancy.</p>
          <p>5. Observe if both be in the same category, the same <lb/>
            genus, and have the same differences.</p>
          <p>6. If both are alike or simultaneously increased and di­ <lb/>
            minished.</p>
          <p>7. If both are equal when the same addition is made tc <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>8. Whether also the consequences of both upon the given <lb/>
            thesis or hypothesis be discrepant.</p>
          <p>9. Whether the same things may be predicated of each, <lb/>
            and they of the same.</p>
          <p>10. Whether they are the same generically, or specifically, <lb/>
            not numerically.</p>
          <p>11. Whether one can subsist without the other.</p>
          <p>CHAP. II.—1. The preceding topics are useful for the subver­ <lb/>
            sion, not the confirmation of definition.</p>
          <p>CHAP. III.—1. As a preliminary to the topics necessary for <lb/>
            confirmation of definition, we should know that few arguers <lb/>
            syllogistically infer definition, but assume such a thing as <lb/>
            a principle.</p>
          <p>2. Next, it belongs to another treatise to assign accurately <lb/>
            what definition is, and how it is necessary to define ; now it <lb/>
            is observed only as sufficient for our present purpose, that <lb/>
            it is possible there may be a syllogism of definition, and of <lb/>
            the very nature of a thing.</p>
          <p>3. In contraries and opposites generally, we must observe <lb/>
            whole sentences and according to parts, selecting from the <lb/>
            many connexions of contraries, that definition which espe­ <lb/>
            cially appears contrary.</p><pb n="705"/>
            
          <p>4. Consideration, according to parts, must be carried on, <lb/>
            first, by showing that the assigned genus is rightly as­ <lb/>
            signed.</p>
          <p>5. Contrary differences also are predicated of contraries, <lb/>
            except the latter be of contrary genera.</p>
          <p>6. We must argue from cases and conjugates, as genera <lb/>
            follow genera, and definitions are consequent to definitions.</p>
          <p>7. Also from things which subsist similarly as to each <lb/>
            other, since the definition of one, will be that of each of <lb/>
            the rest.</p>
          <p>8. Moreover, from the more and the similar, in as many ways <lb/>
            as it is possible to confirm, comparing two with two: when <lb/>
            one definition is compared with two things or two defini­ <lb/>
            tions with one, the consideration from the more is of no use,</p>
          <p>CHAP. IV.—1. The places stated and those from cases and <lb/>
            conjugates, are the most appropriate, so that we should re­ <lb/>
            tain these and have them ready, and of the rest such as are <lb/>
            chiefly common are efficacious.</p>
          <p>CHAP. V.—1. It is easier to subvert than to construct definition.</p>
          <p>2. Also it is easier to subvert than to confirm property, <lb/>
            since the latter being for the most part assigned in conjunc­ <lb/>
            tion of words, may be subverted by the removal of one word, <lb/>
            but he who confirms must conclude every thing by syllogism.</p>
          <p>3. Almost every thing else which may be said of defini­ <lb/>
            tion, will also be suitably said of property.</p>
          <p>4. Genus is confirmed only in one way, viz. by being shown <lb/>
            present with every individual, but it is subverted in two, <lb/>
            i. e. if it is shown not present with any, and not with a <lb/>
            certain one. The confirmer must prove it inherent also as <lb/>
            genus.</p>
          <p>5. Accident, if universal, is more easily subverted: if <lb/>
            particular, more easily confirmed.</p>
          <p>6. Definition is the easiest of all to subvert, since many <lb/>
            things being asserted in it, very many are given, by which <lb/>
            it may be subverted: we may also argue against it, through <lb/>
            topics of genus, property, accident, etc.</p>
          <p>7. Against ether things, we cannot assume arguments <lb/>
            derived from definitions. Neither can we, except in de­ <lb/>
            finitions, argue from some things to others.</p>
          <p>8. Of the rest, property is easiest to subvert, as it con­ <note type="footnote">as </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="706"/>
            sists of many things, for which reason also it is most diffi­ <lb/>
            cult of confirmation.</p>
          <p>9. Accident, of all, is the easiest to confirm, and the <lb/>
            hardest to subvert, since only its inherency need be proved, <lb/>
            and the fewest things are given in it.</p>

          <p>INTRODUCTORY.—THIS last book contains a digest of rules <lb/>
            for syllogistical disputation, which are to be observed by the <lb/>
            questionist and respondent, whence it is evident that not <lb/>
            merely truth, but also victory was regarded by Aristotle as an <lb/>
            object to be attained in controversy.</p>
          <p>CHAP. I.—1. In consideration of order, and how we must in­ <lb/>
            terrogate, the querist must first discover a place whence he <lb/>
            may argue; 2ndly, he must question and arrange the several <lb/>
            particulars to himself; 3rdly, he should advance them <lb/>
            against another person.</p>
          <p>2. The discovery of the place pertains in its consideration <lb/>
            alike to the philosopher and to the dialectician: the lat­ <lb/>
            ter's peculiar province is to arrange and to interrogate, <lb/>
            since this refers to another person, but the philosopher cares <lb/>
            not whether the respondent admits his data or not, if they <lb/>
            be only true and known.</p>
          <p>3. There are certain propositions to be assumed besides <lb/>
            such as are necessary, (i. e. through which a syllogism <lb/>
            arises,) and these are four, viz. either for the sake of induc­ <lb/>
            tion that the universal may be granted, or for amplification, <lb/>
            or for concealment of the conclusion, or for greater perspi­ <lb/>
            cuity. Besides these, no proposition must be assumed.</p>
          <p>4. The necessary propositions must not be advanced im­ <lb/>
            mediately.</p>
          <p>5. They must be assumed either through syllogism or <lb/>
            induction, or some by one and others by the other, except <lb/>
            such as are very evident.</p>
          <p>6. Whoever uses concealment must prove his data for <lb/>
            the syllogism of the original proposition, by pro-syllogisms.</p>
          <p>7. The conclusions of the pro-syllogism are not to be <lb/>
            mentioned, but collected afterwards in a body.</p>
          <p>8. The axioms are not to be taken continuously, but <lb/>
            alternately mixed with the conclusions.</p><pb n="707"/>
            
          <p>9. As far as possible an universal proposition is to be <lb/>
            assumed in the definition, not in the things themselves, but <lb/>
            in their conjugates.</p>
          <p>10. We ought to propose as if we did not do so on ac­ <lb/>
            count of the subject of discussion, but for something else, <lb/>
            and generally concealment of the desired object of conces­ <lb/>
            sion is to be observed.</p>
          <p>11. We must interrogate through similitude.</p>
          <p>12. In order to mask design, the interrogator should <lb/>
            sometimes object to himself, so as to gain the appearance of <lb/>
            candour.</p>
          <p>13. Also affirm that his point is usually asserted.</p>
          <p>14. Wear the appearance of indifference.</p>
          <p>15. Propose as by comparison.</p>
          <p>16. We ought not to propose what ought to be assumed, <lb/>
            but that which this necessarily follows.</p>
          <p>17. Let the querist ask that which he wishes especially <lb/>
            to assume: against some persons such things must be pro­ <lb/>
            posed first.</p>
          <p>18. Extend the discourse and insert things which are of <lb/>
            no use to it.</p>
          <p>19. Induction and division of things homogeneous are to <lb/>
            be used for ornament.</p>
          <p>20. Examples and comparisons are to be adduced for <lb/>
            perspicuity.</p>
          <p>CHAP. II.—1. Syllogism is to be used with dialecticians rather <lb/>
            than with the multitude, but induction rather with the lat­ <lb/>
            ter : in some cases he who makes an induction may interro­ <lb/>
            gate the universal.</p>
          <p>2. In order to prevent the deception incident to the asser­ <lb/>
            tion of similarity, the disputant must endeavour to assign a <lb/>
            name.</p>
          <p>3. When an induction being made in many things, a per­ <lb/>
            son does not admit the universal, the objection may be de­ <lb/>
            manded : also it may be claimed that the objections be not <lb/>
            alleged in the thing itself, unless there is only one such <lb/>
            thing.</p>
          <p>4. Against such as object to the universal, yet do not so <lb/>
            in the same genus, we must interrogate by division.</p>
          <p>5. If thA objection impede the question, being made in <note type="footnote"> 2 Z 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="708"/>
            the same genus, we must remove the ground of objection <lb/>
            and advance the remainder, making it universal.</p>
          <p>6. This must also be done when there is a denial without <lb/>
            an objection.</p>
          <p>7. Direct demonstration is preferable to the deduction <lb/>
            “ ad absurdum."</p>
          <p>8. Things are to be proposed which are difficult of ob­ <lb/>
            jection.</p>
          <p>9. The conclusion must not be made a matter of question.</p>
          <p>10. Not every universal is a dialectic proposition, the <lb/>
            latter being one to which we can reply " yes " or " no."</p>
          <p>11. He interrogates badly who questions one reason for <lb/>
            a long time.</p>
          <p>CHAP. III.—1. Things naturally first and last are difficult to <lb/>
            attack, but easy to defend.</p>
          <p>2. Those proximate to the principle are difficult to be <lb/>
            impugned.</p>
          <p>3. Those definitions are most difficult of attack which <lb/>
            employ such names as render it uncertain whether they are <lb/>
            predicated simply or multifariously, properly or metaphor­ <lb/>
            ically.</p>
          <p>4. Every problem difficult of attack must be supposed to <lb/>
            require definition.</p>
          <p>5. Or as of those things predicated multifariously.</p>
          <p>6. Or as not remote from principles.</p>
          <p>7. Or from the mode to which we are to refer the doubt <lb/>
            being obscure to us.</p>
          <p>8. It is difficult to argue when the definition is badly <lb/>
            enunciated.</p>
          <p>9. The querist and the teacher are not similarly to re­ <lb/>
            quire a thing to be laid down.</p>
          <p>CHAP. IV.—1. It is the querist's duty to make the respondent <lb/>
            assert absurdities: the respondent's, to remove the apparent <lb/>
            absurdity from himself to the thesis.</p>
          <p>CHAP. V.—1. As a different method in dispute is to be ob­ <lb/>
            served by the teacher, the contentious, and the inquirer, it <lb/>
            is necessary to remark that the thesis laid down may be <lb/>
            either probable, improbable, or neither: whichever it is, the <lb/>
            querist always concludes its opposite.</p>
          <p>2. In the case of improbable thesis, the respondent mutt <lb/>
             <pb n="709"/>
            neither grant that which is not simply apparent, nor what <lb/>
            is less so than the conclusion.</p>
          <p>3. If the thesis be simply probable, the conclusion will <lb/>
            be simply improbable: such a thesis must be laid down as <lb/>
            is less improbable than the conclusion.</p>
          <p>4. The same rule must be observed, if the thesis be <lb/>
            neither.</p>
          <p>5. If the thesis be simply probable or improbable, we <lb/>
            must compare it with the apparently true: if it be neither, <lb/>
            we must refer it to the respondent.</p>
          <p>6. If the respondent defends another's opinion, we must <lb/>
            affirm or deny with reference to the entertainment of strange <lb/>
            theories.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VI.—1. As to admissible points, if a statement be pro­ <lb/>
            bable and irrelevant, we must admit it when stated to be <lb/>
            probable: if improbable and irrelevant, we must admit it <lb/>
            with an intimation of its improbability: if it be probable <lb/>
            and relevant, we must allow its apparent truth, but state <lb/>
            that is too near the original proposition, and that this being <lb/>
            admitted, the position is subverted: if it be relevant, but <lb/>
            improbable, we must assert its folly: if neither probable, <lb/>
            nor improbable, nor relevant, we must grant it with no <lb/>
            definition: if relevant, we must assert that from its being <lb/>
            posited the original position is subverted.</p>
          <p>2. They do not syllogize well, who argue from things <lb/>
            more improbable than the conclusion.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VII.—1. The respondent must acknowledge his in­ <lb/>
            comprehension of the obscure.</p>
          <p>2. He must also signify what is multifariously predi­ <lb/>
            cated, and why it is partly false and partly true, in order to <lb/>
            prove that he perceived the ambiguity at first.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VIII.—1. He argues perversely, who neither has any <lb/>
            thing to urge against an induction, nor whence he can <lb/>
            prove the contrary.</p>
          <p>2. Perversity in argument is defined to be a responsion, <lb/>
            contrary to the stated modes destructive of syllogism.</p>
          <p>CHAP. IX.—1. The disputant ought to set out to himself in <lb/>
            argument the thesis and the definition.</p>
          <p>2. But must not defend an improbable hypothesis.</p>
          <p>a. An hypothesis is improbable, either from which ab. <lb/>
             <pb n="710"/>
            surdities arise: or such as the more depraved dispositions <lb/>
            select, and which is contrary to the will.</p>
          <p>CHAP. X.—1. Such arguments as collect the false, must be <lb/>
            solved by subverting the ground of the falsity.</p>
          <p>2. There are four ways of preventing the conclusiveness <lb/>
            of an argument, viz. either, <lb/>
            1st, By subverting the ground of the falsity. <lb/>
            2ndly, By objecting to the querist. <lb/>
            3rdly, By objecting to the questions made. <lb/>
            4thly, By reference to time: this is the worst objection.</p>
          <p>3. Of the above, the first alone is a solution, the others <lb/>
            are certain impediments to the conclusions.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XI.—1. The reprehension of arguments themselves <lb/>
            differs from that of the persons employing them, as some­ <lb/>
            times the person questioned is the cause of erroneous dis­ <lb/>
            cussion.</p>
          <p>2. We must object sometimes to the speaker, sometimes <lb/>
            to the thesis.</p>
          <p>3. Arguments of this kind, being for the sake of exercise, <lb/>
            the false must be sometimes collected and subverted, even <lb/>
            through the false.</p>
          <p>4. In transferring the reasoning, it should be done dia­ <unclear/> <lb/>
            ectically and not contentiously.</p>
          <p>5. An argument may be bad, yet the questionist may <lb/>
            conduct it well.</p>
          <p>6. Bad arguments arise from men asserting contraries, <lb/>
            and admitting what they at first denied.</p>
          <p>7. Reprehensions of argument per se are five: viz. 1st, <lb/>
            When nothing is concluded from the questions. 2nd, When <lb/>
            there is no syllogism against the thesis, from the things and <lb/>
            in the way described. 3rd, If there be a syllogism from ad­ <lb/>
            ditions, worse than those questioned, and less probable thai <lb/>
            the conclusion. 4th, If certain things are taken away <lb/>
            when more has been assumed than was necessary. 5th, If <lb/>
            from things more improbable and less credible than the <lb/>
            conclusion, or from things requiring more labour to demon­ <lb/>
            strate than the problem.</p>
          <p>8. Argument may be reprehensible per se, yet commend­ <lb/>
            able as to the problem, or vice versâ.</p>
          <p>9. When the argument demonstrates, yet there is some­ <lb/>
             <pb n="711"/>
            thing else irrelevant to the conclusion, and there should <lb/>
            appear to be a syllogism, (which however there is not,) it <lb/>
            will be a sophism.</p>
          <p>10. A philosophema is a demonstrative syllogism.</p>
          <p>11. An epicheirema is a dialectic syllogism.</p>
          <p>.12. A sophism is a contentious syllogism.</p>
          <p>13. An aporema is a dialectic syllogism of contradiction.</p>
          <p>14. If a demonstration occurs from two propositions of <lb/>
            unequal probability, what is demonstrated may be more <lb/>
            probable than either.</p>
          <p>15. Circumlocution in proof is erroneous; also to prove <lb/>
            from things not evident, as to the cause whence the reason­ <lb/>
            ing proceeds.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XII.—1. An argument is clear which requires no fur­ <lb/>
            ther interrogation.</p>
          <p>2. Also when things are assumed from which the con­ <lb/>
            clusion necessarily results, but the argument concludes <lb/>
            through conclusions, proved through pro-syllogisms: also <lb/>
            if any thing very probable is deficient.</p>
          <p>3. An argument is false in four ways. Ist, When it <lb/>
            only appears conclusive, i. e. is a contentious syllogism. <lb/>
            2nd, When it concludes irrelevantly. 3rd, Or in an erro­ <lb/>
            neous method. 4th, Or through falsities.</p>
          <p>4. If the reasoning is false it is the fault of the arguer, <lb/>
            yet sometimes inadvertently.</p>
          <p>5. Wherefore the first consideration of argument per se <lb/>
            will be, whether it concludes: next, whether it concludes <lb/>
            the true or false: thirdly, from what data.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XIII.—1. In the discussion of "petitio principii" and <lb/>
            contraries as to opinion, the former seems to occur in five ways.</p>
          <p>Ist, When that is "begged" which ought to be proved: <lb/>
            this is usual in synonyms.</p>
          <p>2nd, When the universal is " begged of what ought to <lb/>
            be particularly proved.</p>
          <p>3rd, When proposing to demonstrate the universal, a per­ <lb/>
            son begs the particular.</p>
          <p>4th, When dividing the problem, he " begs " the question <lb/>
            at issue.</p>
          <p>5th, When he begs one of those which are necessarily <lb/>
            consequent to each other.</p><pb n="712"/>
            
          <p>2. Contraries are also " begged " in five ways, viz.,</p>
          <p>1st, By demanding the opposites, affirmation, and nega­ <lb/>
            tion.</p>
          <p>2ndly, Contraries according to opposition.</p>
          <p>3rdly, If demanding universal to be granted, a person <lb/>
            should require contradiction particularly.</p>
          <p>4thly, If the contrary is begged to the necessary result <lb/>
            of the posita.</p>
          <p>5thly, If two such things are claimed from which there <lb/>
            will be an opposite contradiction.</p>
          <p>3. The difference between the above is, that the error of <lb/>
            “petitio principii" belongs to the conclusion, but contraries <lb/>
            are in the propositions.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XIV.—1. As a preliminary of argumentative exercise, <lb/>
            we must be accustomed to convert arguments.</p>
          <p>2. To convert is, by changing the conclusion with the <lb/>
            remaining interrogations, to subvert one of the data.</p>
          <p>3. Argument is to be considered affirmatively and nega­ <lb/>
            tively, as to every thesis.</p>
          <p>4. We must dispute with ourselves if necessary.</p>
          <p>5. Arguments about the same thesis, must be selected <lb/>
            and compared.</p>
          <p>6. The results of each hypothesis are to be noticed.</p>
          <p>7. A naturally good disposition is requisite for this exer­ <lb/>
            cise, and such disposition consists in ability to select pro­ <lb/>
            perly the true, and to avoid the false.</p>
          <p>8. A thorough knowledge is requisite of the most usual <lb/>
            arguments, especially as to primary theses.</p>
          <p>9. Also abundance and readiness in definitions.</p>
          <p>10. Also promptitude about principles, and a tenacious <lb/>
            memory for propositions; a common proposition, rather than <lb/>
            an argument, should be committed to memory.</p>
          <p>11. An adversary's single argument is to be divided into <lb/>
            many: this may be done by withdrawal from things allied <lb/>
            to the subject matter.</p>
          <p>12. Universal records of arguments must be made.</p>
          <p>13. The contrary mode is to be adopted by the disputant <lb/>
            himself, who is to avoid the universal.</p>
          <p>14. Inductive arguments are to be assigned to the young, <lb/>
            syllogistic ones to the practised man.</p><pb n="713"/>
            
          <p>15. Propositions must be assumed from those skilful in <lb/>
            syllogism, and comparisons from the inductive.</p>
          <p>16. The object of a dialectic exercise is to derive either <lb/>
            a syllogism, or a solution, or a proposition, or an objection, <lb/>
            or whether there has been a right question, and about what.</p>
          <p>17. Exercise is on account of power, especially in pro­ <lb/>
            position and objection.</p>
          <p>18. To propose is to make many things one: to object is <lb/>
            to make one many.</p>
          <p>19. Not every casual person is to be disputed with, lest <lb/>
            we fall into depraved and contentious disputation.</p>
          <p>20. Universal arguments being with more difficulty sup­ <lb/>
            plied, yet of the most general application, are especially to <lb/>
            be sought.</p>

          <p>INTRODUCTORy.-A fallacy occupies the same position to <lb/>
            sound argument, as hypocrisy does to virtue, since it is <lb/>
            error under the mask of truth. Since, however, the human <lb/>
            mind would never be deceived extraneously, except it pos­ <lb/>
            sessed an affinity to deception in itself, the detection of sophis­ <lb/>
            try is no less necessary to the mind's individual deduction of <lb/>
            truth by its own processes, than it is for its defence against <lb/>
            the assailment of another.</p>
          <p>It is fair to attribute all fallacies to a mistake of the con­ <lb/>
            nexion existing between the primary concept and its verbal <lb/>
            sign ; for if the latter be not an appropriate exponent of the <lb/>
            former, it is clear that the simple becomes the multiform, and <lb/>
            the relation of A to B as existent in the mind of the speaker, <lb/>
            does not present the same combination of idea to the mind of <lb/>
            the hearer. I say this to place at once upon simple ground <lb/>
            the actual nature of sophistry in idea, by removing the dif­ <lb/>
            fuse dogmatism which has obscured the proper understand­ <lb/>
            ing of it.</p>
          <p>Aristotle reduces fallacies in diction to six, which belong to <lb/>
            ambiguity in 1. sense, 2. manner, 3 and 4 syntax, 5. accent, <lb/>
            6. figure of speech ; and besides these annexes, seven fallacies <lb/>
            not in diction, but in the thing itself, all which latter, he <lb/>
             <pb n="714"/>
            shows may be brought under ignoratio elenchi. Besides this <lb/>
            enumeration, there are many other points in the treatise, con­ <lb/>
            cerning the management of syllogistical dispute, and its im­ <lb/>
            portance cannot be overrated when we recollect that the very <lb/>
            essence of evil, characterizing falsity, is its possessing a cer­ <lb/>
            tain portion of mutilated truth, which falsity, under the form <lb/>
            of genuine argument, may by the misapplication of words, or <lb/>
            the misrepresentation of a principle, surreptitiously introduce <lb/>
            incompetent reasoning, to disturb the formal and material <lb/>
            laws of human thought.</p>
          <p>CHAP. I.—1. Those are not always true syllogisms which <lb/>
            appear so, as in other things neither is that really noble nor <lb/>
            genuine which seems so, both in the case of what is animate <lb/>
            and inanimate.</p>
          <p>2. An elenchus is a syllogism with contradiction of a <lb/>
            conclusion.</p>
          <p>3. Its most natural place is from names, since using <lb/>
            names as symbols of things, we think that what happens to <lb/>
            the one, does also to the other.</p>
          <p>4. The unskilful in the power of names is most exposed <lb/>
            to paralogism.</p>
          <p>5. As some men rather desire to seem than to be wise, <lb/>
            so the sophist is a trader from apparent, but not real wisdom.</p>
          <p>6. It is the duty of the skilful man not to practise, but <lb/>
            to expose deception; this consists in being able to give and <lb/>
            receive a reason.</p>
          <p>7. The following treatise is intended for the investi­ <lb/>
            gation of such arguments from which sophistical power and <lb/>
            its various sources may be understood.</p>
          <p>CHAP. II.—1. There are four genera of arguments in disputa­ <lb/>
            tion, viz. the didactic, the dialectic, the peirastic or tenta­ <lb/>
            tive, and the contentious.</p>
          <p>2. The didactic syllogize from the proper principles of <lb/>
            each discipline.</p>
          <p>3. The dialectic collect contradiction from probabilities.</p>
          <p>4. The peirastic conclude from things appearing to the <lb/>
            respondent, and which he must know, who pretends to <lb/>
            science.</p>
          <p>5. The contentious infer, or seem to infer, from the ap­ <lb/>
            parently probable.</p><pb n="715"/>
            
          <p>6. The demonstrative having been discussed in the Ana­ <lb/>
            lytics, and the dialectic and peirastic in the Topics, the <lb/>
            discussion is now about the contentious.</p>
          <p>CHAP. III.—1. The objects which disputants have in view are <lb/>
            five, viz. 1. An elenchus. 2. The false. 3. The paradox.</p>
          <p>4. The solecism. 5. To make the opponent trifle, or repeat <lb/>
            himself, or what seems to be each of these. The order <lb/>
            stated presents the comparative preference of each mode <lb/>
            entertained by the sophist.</p>
          <p>CHAP. IV.—1. Elenchus may be employed either, 1st, With <lb/>
            diction ; 2nd, Without diction.</p>
          <p>2. Elenchus with diction contains six modes, viz. equivo­ <lb/>
            cation, ambiguity, composition, division, accent, figure of <lb/>
            speech.</p>
          <p>3. The modes of the equivocal and ambiguous are three: <lb/>
            1. When the sentence signifies properly many things. 2. <lb/>
            When we are accustomed thus to speak. 3. When the con­ <lb/>
            joined signifies many things, but when separate is taken <lb/>
            simply.</p>
          <p>4. In the fallacy of composition, the same term is taken, <lb/>
            first, in a distinctive, next, in a collective sense: in division <lb/>
            it is vice versa.</p>
          <p>5. Errors in accent are chiefly incident to writing.</p>
          <p>6. Those from figure of speech are when the gender is <lb/>
            interpreted wrongly, or a confusion is made in the Cate­ <lb/>
            gories.</p>
          <p>CHAP. V.—1. Paralogisms without diction are seven, 1. From <lb/>
            accident. 2. From what is asserted simply or not simply.</p>
          <p>3. From ignorance of the elenchus. 4. From the conse­ <lb/>
            quent. 5. From petitio principii. 6. From placing non <lb/>
            causa pro causa. 7. From making many interrogations one.</p>
          <p>2. Paralogism from accident is when a thing is required <lb/>
            to be granted similarly present with a subject and accident.</p>
          <p>3. From the simply and not simply, when what is predi­ <lb/>
            cated in part is assumed as spoken simply; in some cases <lb/>
            this paralogism is latent.</p>
          <p>4. From absence of definition of syllogism or elenchus, <lb/>
            in fact, in an extensive sense every fallacy is an ignoratio <lb/>
            elenchi.</p>
          <p>5. Fallacies from petitio principii arise from as many <lb/>
             <pb n="716"/>
            ways as we can beg the original question, they seem to <lb/>
            confute from mistaken identity.</p>
          <p>6. The elenchus from the consequent arises from fancy­ <lb/>
            ing that. the consequence reciprocates.</p>
          <p>7. From non causa pro causa is, when what is causeless <lb/>
            is taken as if the elenchus arose from it, this happens in <lb/>
            syllogisms ad impossibile.</p>
          <p>8. From making two interrogations one, a fallacy arises <lb/>
            when neglecting that there are many, we answer as if to <lb/>
            one interrogation. In some cases it is easy, in others diffi­ <lb/>
            cult, to detect this fallacy.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VI.—1. All deceptions may be referred to ignorance <lb/>
            of the elenchus, and of syllogistic art.</p>
          <p>2. Paralogisms from diction are either from two-fold <lb/>
            signification; a sentence not being the same, or the name <lb/>
            being different.</p>
          <p>3. If there is not a syllogism of accident, there is not an <lb/>
            . elenchus, the former frequently occurs between artists and <lb/>
            unscientific men.</p>
          <p>4. Those " in a certain respect and simply," are from the <lb/>
            affirmation and negation being not of the same thing.</p>
          <p>5. An apparent elenchus is produced. from ellipse of <lb/>
            definition.</p>
          <p>6. Those from petitio principii and admitting non causa <lb/>
            pro causa, become manifest by definition.</p>
          <p>7. Those from the consequent are a part of accident, dif­ <lb/>
            fering only in that we can assume accident only in one <lb/>
            thing, but the consequent in many things.</p>
          <p>8. Paralogisms, from making many questions one, consist <lb/>
            in not distinctly unfolding the definition of the proposition.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VII.—1. Deception from equivocation and ambiguity, <lb/>
            arises from inability to distinguish what is variously pre­ <lb/>
            dicated.</p>
          <p>2. From composition and division, from imagining no dif­ <lb/>
            ference to exist between a conjoined and divided sentence.</p>
          <p>3. From accent, because as sometimes accent does not <lb/>
            affect the sense, so when the latter. is changed, we take it <lb/>
            as the same.</p>
          <p>4. From figure of speech, because when words have the <lb/>
            ame figure, we wrongly take them in the same way.</p><pb n="717"/>
            
          <p>5. From accident triply, by not distinguishing between <lb/>
            the same and different, between one and many, and from <lb/>
            ignorance as to all things which are said of the attribute <lb/>
            being said of the subject.</p>
          <p>6. From the consequent as being a certain part of acci­ <lb/>
            dent, we erroneously take it universally.</p>
          <p>7. From defective definition and from those " in a certain <lb/>
            respect and simply," because the difference is small, like­ <lb/>
            wise in the case of petitio principii.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VIII.—1. A sophistical elenchus and syllogism are not <lb/>
            only such as are apparent, but not real, but also the real, <lb/>
            yet which appear falsely appropriate to a thing.</p>
          <p>2. Sophistical elenchi, though they syllogistically infer <lb/>
            contradiction, do not render manifest the ignorance of the <lb/>
            opponent.</p>
          <p>3. False syllogisms will be derived from as many places <lb/>
            as apparent elenchus : the latter is from parts of the true.</p>
          <p>4. A sophistical elenchus is not simply so, but against <lb/>
            some person, and a syllogism likewise.</p>
          <p>CHAP. IX.—1. We must not assume from how many places <lb/>
            confutation by elenchus occurs, without universal science.</p>
          <p>2. There are true elenchi, since in what we may demon­ <lb/>
            strate, we may also confute him who contradicts the truth; <lb/>
            hence we must be scientifically cognizant of the principles <lb/>
            of the several arts.</p>
          <p>3. Places are not to be assumed of all elenchi, but of those <lb/>
            which belong to dialectic, and are common to every art and <lb/>
            faculty.</p>
          <p>4. The scientific man ought to investigate the elenchus <lb/>
            in each science; that which falls under no art, but is from <lb/>
            things common, belongs to dialectics.</p>
          <p>5. The dialectician should be able to assume from what <lb/>
            number of particulars through common propositions, either <lb/>
            a real or apparent elenchus, dialectic or apparently dialectic, <lb/>
            is produced.</p>
          <p>CHAP. X.—1. They err, who state that some arguments belong <lb/>
            to the name, but others to the reason, since the one only de­ <lb/>
            rives its effect from the signification given to it by the other.</p>
          <p>2. The immediate discussion of an elenchus is absurd, as <lb/>
            that of a syllogism ought to precede it.</p><pb n="718"/>
            
          <p>3. The cause of deception is either in the syllogism or in <lb/>
            the contradiction, or in both, if the elenchus be apparent. <lb/>
            This statement is confirmed by mathematical questions.</p>
          <p>4. In order to avoid equivocation, if the questionist should <lb/>
            be required, where distinction is made, to point out the fal­ <lb/>
            lacy, the demand will be absurd, since not only may the <lb/>
            querist himself not perceive the fallacy, but such a process <lb/>
            would be not disputation, but teaching.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XI.—1. To postulate affirmation or denial is not the <lb/>
            province of the demonstrative, but of the peirastic art.</p>
          <p>2. The dialectician considers things common, the sophist <lb/>
            does this apparently.</p>
          <p>3. The contentious and sophistical syllogism are one, ap­ <lb/>
            parently syllogistic about things with which the peirastic <lb/>
            dialectic is conversant, but false descriptions are not con­ <lb/>
            tentious.</p>
          <p>4. Those who make conquest their object are contentious, <lb/>
            those who strive for the sake of glory, which tends to gain, <lb/>
            are sophists.</p>
          <p>5. The sophistical art is defined to be a certain art of <lb/>
            making money from apparent wisdom.</p>
          <p>6. The contentious and sophistical employ the same ar­ <lb/>
            guments, but so far as the latter are used for apparent <lb/>
            victory, they are contentious, and so far as they are for <lb/>
            apparent wisdom, they are sophistical.</p>
          <p>7. The contentious man stands in relation to the dialec­ <lb/>
            tician, as the false describer to the geometrician.</p>
          <p>8. The dialectician is neither in any definite genus, nor <lb/>
            is he such as the universal philosopher, since neither are all <lb/>
            things in one certain genus, nor are demonstrative arts in­ <lb/>
            terrogative, which last is the characteristic of dialectic.</p>
          <p>9. Dialectic is also peirastic, the latter being the science <lb/>
            of nothing definite, but is conversant with all things.</p>
          <p>10. All men, even idiots, use after a certain manner dia­ <lb/>
            lectic and peirastic, and partake without art of the subject <lb/>
            of dialectic.</p>
          <p>11. The contentious will not be paralogistic from a certain <lb/>
            definite genus of principles, but will be about every genus.</p>
          <p>CHAP XII.— .1. With regard to showing some false assertion, <lb/>
            it is remarked that this generally happens from a certain <lb/>
             <pb n="719"/>
            manner of inquiry, and through interrogation, e. g. to inter­ <lb/>
            rogate nothing definitely laid down, and to ask many ques­ <lb/>
            tions requiring a person to declare his opinion.</p>
          <p>2. Though less common than formerly, yet the element <lb/>
            of obtaining something false is to question no thesis imme­ <lb/>
            diately, but to assert that the question is made from the <lb/>
            desire of learning.</p>
          <p>3. To prove a false assertion, a proper sophistical place <lb/>
            is to bring the opponent to the arguer's strong point.</p>
          <p>4. To prove paradoxes, ascertain what the philosophers <lb/>
            of the opponent's order assert paradoxical.</p>
          <p>5. From volitions, the secret wish of the mind, and ap­ <lb/>
            parent opinions, paradoxes may be elicited, indeed generally <lb/>
            the place of causing paradoxical assertion is very extensive.</p>
          <p>6. From nature and law.</p>
          <p>7. From the opinion of the wise and of the multitude, <lb/>
            indeed some questions have a paradoxical answer either way.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XIII.—1. Loquacious trifling is produced from such <lb/>
            arguments as belong to relative notions, or wherein there <lb/>
            are habits, or passions, or some such thing manifested in the <lb/>
            definition of the predicates. Generally it is from the in­ <lb/>
            quiry not being added as to the meaning of the double <lb/>
            enunciation.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XIV.—1. Solecism may be produced without appearing <lb/>
            to do so, and not produced when it apparently is.</p>
          <p>2. Almost all apparent solecisms are from hoc, that is, the <lb/>
            neuter gender.</p>
          <p>3. Solecism resembles fallacy from figure of speech, from <lb/>
            things not similar being similarly assumed.</p>
          <p>4. In order to conceal, it is necessary to arrange the <lb/>
            elements of interrogations.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XV.—1. Certain artifices which contribute to confuta­ <lb/>
            tion by an elenchus are prolixity, rapidity, anger, and con­ <lb/>
            tention, (which last arise from a man's conducting himself <lb/>
            with impudence,) alternate arrangement of questions, and <lb/>
            whatever, in short, contribute to concealment, the same are <lb/>
            also useful for contentious arguments.</p>
          <p>2. Against contentious opponents, we must interrogate <lb/>
            from negation or equally.</p>
          <p>3. Also employ the universal as granted.</p><pb n="720"/>
            
          <p>4. Also assuming a proposition through comparison of <lb/>
            the quantity.</p>
          <p>5. The sophistical false charge of those who question <lb/>
            without syllogistic conclusion, asserting as if a conclusion be <lb/>
            made, often contributes to apparent confutation by elenchus.</p>
          <p>6. It is sophistical when a paradox is laid down to chal­ <lb/>
            lenge what is apparent.</p>
          <p>7. In elenchtic disputations, as in rhetorical, we must <lb/>
            investigate contrarieties.</p>
          <p>8. Also withdraw from the argument, in order to antici­ <lb/>
            pate future attack.</p>
          <p>9. Also attack something different to the assertion.</p>
          <p>10. Also state that in elenchi we assert contradiction.</p>
          <p>11. The conclusion must not be questioned after the <lb/>
            manner of a proposition.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XVI.—1. In this and the following chapters, he pro­ <lb/>
            ceeds to discuss the solution of sophistical arguments, and <lb/>
            in what their use consists.</p>
          <p>2. They are useful to philosophy, for three reasons, first, <lb/>
            as being chiefly from diction, they render us better ac­ <lb/>
            quainted with the various ways of predication; secondly, <lb/>
            they contribute to inquiries by oneself, thus precluding self­ <lb/>
            deception ; thirdly, they enhance our fame from giving the <lb/>
            appearance of general skill.</p>
          <p>3. To solve a futile argument is not the same thing as to <lb/>
            be able quickly to oppose an interrogator; hence in argu­ <lb/>
            mentative as in other exercises, practice is necessary to per­ <lb/>
            fection.</p>
          <p>4. We may know the cause of connexion, yet be unable <lb/>
            to solve the argument.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XVII.—1. Probable rather than true solution, is some­ <lb/>
            times to be sought. And we must guard, not only against <lb/>
            real, but apparent confutation of ourselves.</p>
          <p>2. If that is supposed to be an elenchus, which is accord­ <lb/>
            ing to equivocation, the respondent cannot avoid confutation <lb/>
            by an elenchus, but wherever there is an ambiguity, it is <lb/>
            to be expounded, and the interrogation is not to be simply <lb/>
            granted.</p>
          <p>3. Without two interrogations are made one, there will <lb/>
            net be a paralogism from ambiguity.</p><pb n="721"/>
            
          <p>4. As there may be pseudo elenchi, so also there may be <lb/>
            pseudo solutions, which yet are sometimes to be adduced <lb/>
            against contentious arguments and duplicity.</p>
          <p>5. We must seem to admit things which seem to be true <lb/>
            in order to avoid a parexelenchus.</p>
          <p>6. As things consequent from necessity seem to be parts <lb/>
            of the thesis itself, that must be admitted to be the same as <lb/>
            the question, which though false or paradoxical, yet results <lb/>
            from the thesis, and is required to be granted.</p>
          <p>7. When universal is assumed, not in name, but com­ <lb/>
            paratively, the opponent must be said to assume it, not as <lb/>
            it was given.</p>
          <p>8. Whoever is excluded from these, must attack the <lb/>
            demonstration.</p>
          <p>9. Names properly so called, we must answer either sim­ <lb/>
            ply or distinctively.</p>
          <p>10. When the existence of one thing seems necessarily <lb/>
            to follow that of another, but not vice versa, the respondent <lb/>
            ought to grant the particular rather than the universal.</p>
          <p>11. By transferring names in things asserted by the <lb/>
            multitude, and of which there is a double opinion as to <lb/>
            truth, a person may escape detection.</p>
          <p>12. Anticipated questions must be previously objected to.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XVIII.—1. A right solution is the detection of a false <lb/>
            syllogism, showing by what questions the falsity occurs.</p>
          <p>2. A syllogism is called false, either if it be falsely con­ <lb/>
            cluded, or if, not being a syllogism, it seems to be one.</p>
          <p>3. The solution now treated of as true, is a correction of <lb/>
            apparent syllogism, showing from what question it is ap­ <lb/>
            parent.</p>
          <p>4. Syllogistic arguments are solved by negation, appa­ <lb/>
            rent ones by distinction.</p>
          <p>5. We solve syllogistic arguments, false in the conclusion, <lb/>
            by removing some one of the interrogations, and by showing <lb/>
            that the conclusion does not thus subsist.</p>
          <p>6. Those which are false according to the propositions, we <lb/>
            solve by removing some interrogation only.</p>
          <p>7. Those who desire to solve argument, must first consider <lb/>
            its conclusiveness, next, the truth or falsity of its conclusion.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XIX.—1. Of elenchi from equivocation and ambiguity <note type="footnote"> 3 A </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="722"/>
            some have an interrogation signifying many things, others <lb/>
            have a conclusion multifariously stated.</p>
          <p>2. In the latter case, except the opponent assumes contra­ <lb/>
            diction, there is not an elenchus: in the former, it is not <lb/>
            necessary to deny what is two-fold before the distinction is <lb/>
            drawn.</p>
          <p>3. The name and the sentence being two-fold, we must <lb/>
            partially admit and deny.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XX.—1. In solution of arguments from composition and <lb/>
            division, we must state what is contrary to the conclusion.</p>
          <p>2. What is assumed from division is not two-fold, nor <lb/>
            are all elenchi from the two-fold.</p>
          <p>3. Where there is different signification, a distinction is <lb/>
            to be drawn, by the respondent.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XXI.—1. Only a few arguments are derived from <lb/>
            accent, the solution of which is easy from the signification <lb/>
            of the word being dissimilar, according to the variety of <lb/>
            accent.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XXII.—1. The error of sophisms founded upon figure <lb/>
            of speech, consists in their taking different things for the <lb/>
            same, and referring to the same what belong to different <lb/>
            categories.</p>
          <p>2. Such sophisms therefore must be solved by distin­ <lb/>
            guishing the categories.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XXIII.—1. Sophisms whereof the fault is "in dictione" <lb/>
            may all be solved by asserting the contrary to the sophis­ <lb/>
            tical assumption, which being affirmed produces the false <lb/>
            syllogism.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XXIV.—1. As to solution of deceptions from accident, <lb/>
            we must assert that what is present with the accident need <lb/>
            not be with the subject, in other words, we must deny the <lb/>
            consequence from the accident to the subject.</p>
          <p>2. Some solve these sophisms by distinguishing the ques­ <lb/>
            tion, but in both cases there must be the same correction of <lb/>
            arguments derived from the same place, so that this is an <lb/>
            inappropriate method of solution.</p>
          <p>3. It is also an imperfect solution to endeavour tc lead to <lb/>
            the impossible.</p>
          <p>4. Also to say every number is both great and small, <lb/>
            since in reality no conclusion is drawn</p><pb n="723"/>
            
          <p>5. Some solve them by duplicity, the deception arising <lb/>
            from the double sense in which the word is used.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XXV.—1. Arguments deduced from what is properly <lb/>
            and not simply predicated, we must solve by comparing the <lb/>
            opponent's conclusion with our own thesis, in order to as­ <lb/>
            certain whether a statement can be made, not simply, but <lb/>
            in a certain respect or relation.</p>
          <p>2. A thing may be simply false, but relatively true, also <lb/>
            certain things may be true, and yet not true simply.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XXVI.—1. In solution of arguments from the definition <lb/>
            of elenchus, we must consider the conclusion with reference <lb/>
            to contradiction, since except there is the latter, there is no <lb/>
            elenchus.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XXVII.—1. Sophisms from petitio principii must not be <lb/>
            granted to the inquirer.</p>
          <p>2. If the original question be dubious, the fault must be <lb/>
            charged on the questionist.</p>
          <p>3. The defender must plead that he did not grant it for <lb/>
            the opponent's use, but in order syllogistically to prove the <lb/>
            contrary.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XXVIII.—1. Solution of deceptions from consequents <lb/>
            we must draw from the argument itself.</p>
          <p>2. The consequence of consequents is either as universal <lb/>
            to particular, or according to oppositions.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XXIX.—1. Whatever syllogistically concludes from some <lb/>
            addition, we must observe whether it being taken away, the <lb/>
            impossible results, afterwards making this clear, we must <lb/>
            state that the respondent granted not what appeared true, <lb/>
            but what was adapted to the argument, and the charge of <lb/>
            irrelevant argument must be brought against the arguer.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XXX.—1. Against sophisms which make many inter­ <lb/>
            rogations one, we must use definition immediately at first.</p>
          <p>2. Some arguments of this kind come under the head of <lb/>
            equivocation.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XXXI.—1. In sophisms leading to repetition, we must <lb/>
            deny that the categories of relatives signify any thing by <lb/>
            themselves.</p>
          <p>2. Diction must not be granted in a direct case. <note type="footnote"> 3 A 2 </note></p><pb n="724"/>
            
          <p>CHAP. XXXII.—In solecisms it must be stated that the oppo­ <lb/>
            nent does not really, but only apparently, conclude a sole­ <lb/>
            cism, because we seem to have granted what we have not <lb/>
            granted.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XXXIII.—1. In some arguments it is easier, in others <lb/>
            more difficult, to ascertain the cause of deception, and the <lb/>
            argument which may seem to some to be derived from the <lb/>
            diction, may to others appear to arise from accident: that <lb/>
            however is the same argument which is derived from the <lb/>
            same place.</p>
          <p>2. The most acute argument is that which induces the <lb/>
            greatest doubt.</p>
          <p>3. Doubt is two-fold, one in arguments concluding syllo­ <lb/>
            gistically as to which proposition is to be denied, the other <lb/>
            in contentious arguments, as to how some one should dis­ <lb/>
            cuss the proposition.</p>
          <p>4. A syllogistic argument is most acute which subverts <lb/>
            what is especially probable from things especially pro­ <lb/>
            bable.</p>
          <p>5. The most acute contentious argument is that wherein <lb/>
            from the first it is uncertain whether it is syllogistically <lb/>
            concluded or not, and whether the solution is from the <lb/>
            false or from division.</p>
          <p>6. The argument inconclusive is absurd, if the assump­ <lb/>
            tions be very incredible or false, but sometimes it is not <lb/>
            altogether despicable.</p>
          <p>7. The querist may argue against the thesis, against the <lb/>
            respondent, and against the time.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XXXIV.—1. In recapitulation the reader is reminded <lb/>
            of the author's original design in his work, viz. to discover <lb/>
            a certain syllogistic faculty about a problem, proposed from <lb/>
            things in the highest degree probable, which is the office of <lb/>
            the dialectic per se, and also of the peirastic art.</p>
          <p>2. That as true argument may be assailed by sophistry <lb/>
            the defence of the thesis in a similar manner, through the <lb/>
            greatest probabilities was to be considered.</p>
          <p>3. That the number of problems with their proper <lb/>
            sources, also the method and arrangement of interroga­ <lb/>
            tions and paralogisms, had been developed.</p>
          <p>4. As the commencement of every thing is perhaps the <lb/>
             <pb n="725"/>
            greatest part of it, so almost all discoveries owe their <lb/>
            excellence to an imperfect original, a subsequent partial <lb/>
            elaboration, and successive increase, but of dialectic nothing <lb/>
            has existed at all.</p>
          <p>5. The schools of contentious arguers for gain, merely <lb/>
            afforded a certain kind of instruction, similar to the treatise <lb/>
            of Gorgias; on the other hand, teachers gave rhetorical <lb/>
            or interrogative discourses to be learned, according as they <lb/>
            thought such to be adapted to their conversation with each <lb/>
            other.</p>
          <p>6. Though many old discourses are extant about rhetoric, <lb/>
            yet, before Aristotle, none existed concerning the art of syl­ <lb/>
            logism, wherefore as the barrenness of the materials ought <lb/>
            to plead an excuse for any deficiency in the method, so it <lb/>
            should enhance the gratitude felt by the student towards <lb/>
            the author of so laborious an investigation.</p>
