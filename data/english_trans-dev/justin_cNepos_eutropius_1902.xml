          <p>THIS volume contains Versions of Justin, Cornelius <lb/>
            Nepos, and Eutropius.</p>
          <p>Justin has been translated from the text of Wetzel, <lb/>
            Cornelius Nepos from that of Bos, as re-edited by Fischer; <lb/>
            and Eutropius from that of Tszchucke.</p>
          <p>Each of the authors has been rendered in a style as <lb/>
            easy as was consistent with a faithful adherence to the <lb/>
            sense.</p>
          <p>Notes on points of history, and on peculiarities in the <lb/>
            text, have been given wherever they seemed to be required. <lb/>
            Remarks on the authors are prefixed, and a copious Index <lb/>
            added <lb/>

          </head>
          <p>As Justiu is not properly an author, but an abridger, we stall <lb/>
            first give our attention to the writer whom he abridged.</p>
          <p>All that is certainly known of the personal history of <lb/>
            Trogus Pompeius is, that he was a Roman by birth ;* that his <lb/>
            ancestors were of the Vocontii, a people of Italy; that his <lb/>
            grandfather, Trogus Pompeius, was presented with the right <lb/>
            of citizenship by Pompey during the war with Sertorius ; that <lb/>
            his uncle was an officer of cavalry under Pompey, in the war <lb/>
            with Mithridates; and that his father served in the army <lb/>
            under Julius Cæsar, and was afterwards his private secretary.! <lb/>
            Trogus himself must, therefore, have flourished under Au­ <lb/>
            gustus. The last event that he appears to have recorded is <lb/>
            the restoration of the Roman standards by the Parthians.</p>
          <p>He wrote a history in forty-four books, which he entitled <lb/>
            Historic Plilippicæ, because, as is supposed, his chief design <lb/>
            in writing it was to relate the origin, progress, decline, and <lb/>
            extinction of the Macedonian monarchy, and especially the <lb/>
            achievements of Philip and his son. But he allowed himself, <lb/>
            like Herodotus and other historians, to indulge in such large <lb/>
            digressions and excursions, that it was regarded by many as a <lb/>
            Universal History, and is represented, in some manuscripts. <note type="footnote"> * Just. xliii. 1. </note><note type="footnote">t Jus4 xliii. fin. </note> <note type="footnote"> b </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="vi"/>
            as containing totius mundi origines et terræ situs, a character <lb/>
            to which it had no right.</p>
          <p>The first six books comprised the period antecedent to <lb/>
            Philip, in which an account was given of the Assyrians, Per­ <lb/>
            sians, Egyptians, Scythians, Athenians, and Lacedæmonians; <lb/>
            the history of Macedonia was commenced in the seventh book, <lb/>
            and continued, in combination with other matters, to the over <lb/>
            throw of Andriscus, the Pseudo-Philippus, in the thirty-third. <lb/>
            The prologi, or arguments, which we have of all the books, <lb/>
            similar to the epitomes of the lost books of Livy, were first <lb/>
            published by Bongarsius.</p>
          <p>He seems to have taken his materials from the Greek his­ <lb/>
            torians.* His title appears to have been suggested by the <lb/>
            Philippica of Theopompus, a voluminous work, of which Ste­ <lb/>
            phanus do Urbibus cites the fifty-seventh book.</p>
          <p>Whatever speeches he inserted were in the oblique form, for <lb/>
            he blamed Livy and Sallust for giving long direct speeches <lb/>
            in their histories.‡ He is praised by Justin for his eloquence ; <lb/>
            vir priscæ eloquentiæ; § and Vopiseus|| ranks his style with <lb/>
            those of Sallust, Livy, and Tacitus.</p>
          <p>A treatise of Trogus, de Animalibus, is mentioned by Chari­ <lb/>
            sius,¶ and Trogus is quoted as an authority by Pliny in several <lb/>
            passages of his Natural History; and this Trogus is generally <lb/>
            supposed to be the same as Trogus the historian.</p>
          <p>A writer named Trogus is also twice cited by Priscian, in <lb/>
            his fifth and sixth books, but whether he is the Trogus of <lb/>
            Justin, is uncertain. <note type="footnote"> * See Heeren de Trog. Pomp. Fontibus et Auctoritate, prefixed te <lb/>
            Frotscher’s edition. </note><note type="footnote"> t In <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μεσσαπέαι</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Just. xxviii. a. </note><note type="footnote">§ Just.

          <p>The epitome that Justin made of the large work of Trogus, <lb/>
            has often been supposed the cause that the original was lost.</p>
          <p>Who or what JUSTIN was, we are left in ignorance; we <lb/>
            know not even what name he had besides Justinus, for though <lb/>
            one manuscript entitles him Justinus Frontinus, and another <lb/>
            M. Junianus Justinus, the other manuscripts give him only <lb/>
            one name.</p>
          <p>From the words Imperator Antonine, which occur in the <lb/>
            preface in the editions of Aldus and others, he has been often <lb/>
            said to have lived in the reign of that emperor; but those <lb/>
            words are now generally thought to have been interpolated by <lb/>
            some, who, like Isidore and Jornandes, confounded him with <lb/>
            Justin Martyr.* From an expression in the eighth book, <lb/>
            where Greece is said to be etiam nunc et viribus et dignitate <lb/>
            orbis terrarum princeps, it has been conjectured that lie <lb/>
            flourished under the Eastern emperors; but such conjecture is <lb/>
            groundless, for the words merely refer to the period of which <lb/>
            the author is writing, and may be, indeed, not Justin's, but <lb/>
            Trogus's.</p>
          <p>His style, however, in which occur the words adunare, im­ <lb/>
            possibilis, præsumtio, opinio for " report, and other words and <lb/>
            phrases of inferior Latinity, show that he must have lived <lb/>
            some considerable time after the Augustan age. Such phrase­ <lb/>
            ology could not have been found in the pages of Trogus. But <lb/>
            Justin could not have been later than the beginning of the <lb/>
            fifth century, as he is mentioned by St. Jerome.t</p>
          <p>That he was not a Christian, is proved, as Vossius remarks, <lb/>
            by the ignorance which he manifests of the Jewish Scrip­ <lb/>
            tures; ‡ for he could not, assuredly, have copied Trogus's <lb/>
            vagaries without bestowing some correction upon them. He <lb/>
            has been censured for not making a more regular abridgment <note type="footnote"> * See the note on that passage of the Preface. </note><note type="footnote"> + Proœm. in Daniel. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Just. xxxvi. 1, 2. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="viii"/>
            of his author's work, but without justice; for he intended only <lb/>
            to extract or abbreviate such portions as he thought more <lb/>
            likely than others to please the general reader.</p>
          <p>His composition is animated, and in general correct, but <lb/>
            not of the highest order of merit. His peculiarities of phrase­ <lb/>
            ology are carefully specified by Wetzel in his prolegomena, <lb/>
            though he has omitted to remark his constant use of the con­ <lb/>
            junction quasi in his narratives and descriptions.</p>
          <p>It is observed by Dr. Robertson,* that “ we cannot rely on <lb/>
            Justin's evidence, unless when it is confirmed by the tes­ <lb/>
            timony of other ancient authors." The remark ought rather <lb/>
            to be transferred to Trogus, whom Justin seems faithfully to <lb/>
            have followed, and who seems, indeed, to have been a writer <lb/>
            of sufficient credulity, as his account of Habis, in his forty- <lb/>
            fourth book, may serve to show. But there is no historian, as <lb/>
            Vopiscust says, that does not tell something false, and Livy, <lb/>
            Sallust, Tacitus, and Trogus, alike exhibit passages not proof <lb/>
            against strict examination.</p>
          <p>The best editions of Justin are those of Bongarsius, Paris, <lb/>
            1581 ; of Grævius, Lugd. Bat., 1683, which has been several <lb/>
            times reprinted ; of Hearne, Oxon, 1703 ; of Gronovius, Lugd. <lb/>
            Bat. 1719, 1760; of Fischer, Lips. 1757; and of Wetzel, <lb/>
            Lips. 1806. reprinted in Lemaire's Bibliotheque Classique, <lb/>
            1823.</p>
          <p>The oldest English Version is that of Arthur Goldinge, <lb/>
            1564, and the next that of Robert Codrington, 1654, both of <lb/>
            whom had but an imperfect knowledge of the language of <lb/>
            their author. There have since appeared translations by <lb/>
            Thomas Brown, 1712; by Nicolas Bayley, 1732; by Clarke, <lb/>
            1732 ; and by Turn bull, 1746, the last being the most readable <lb/>
            performance, but not always faithful to the sense. <note type="footnote"> * Disquisition on Anc. India, note 12, </note><note type="footnote"> † Life of Aurelian, prope init. </note></p>

            <title type="main">NOTICE OF THE LIFE AND WRITINGS OF CORNELIUS NEPOS.</title>
          </head>
          <p>COBNELIUS NEPOS is generally supposed to have been born <lb/>
            at Hostilia,* a village in the neighbourhood of Verona, a town <lb/>
            included in Cisalpine Gaul. Hence Ausonius,† speaking of <lb/>
            Catullus's ‡ dedication of his poems to Cornelius Nepos, says <lb/>
            that Gaul supplied the personage to whom the dedication was <lb/>
            addressed. Pliny the elder § calls him Padi accola, Hostilia <lb/>
            being at no great distance from the Po.</p>
          <p>He enjoyed the intimate friendship, not only of Catullus, <lb/>
            but of Cicero || and Atticus.¶ In Eusebius's Chronicon he is <lb/>
            placed in the fourth year of the reign of Augustus, which <lb/>
            Vossius supposed to be the time when he first began to attract <lb/>
            attention by his writings. Pliny** says that he died in the <lb/>
            reign of Augustus. No other particulars concerning his per­ <lb/>
            sonal history have reached us. <note type="footnote"> * Voss. de Hist. Lat. Prolegomena to Van Staveren’s edition by <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>From various passages in ancient authors we find that he <lb/>
            wrote the following works.</p>
          <p>1. Chronica, to which Catullus appears to allude in his <lb/>
            dedication to Nepos:— <lb/>
            Ausus as unus Italorum <lb/>
            Omne ævum tribus explicare chartis, <lb/>
            Doctis, Jupiter! et laboriosis.</p>
          <p>Ausonius also mentions the work in his sixteenth Epistle, to <lb/>
            Probus, and Aulus Genius in the twenty-first chapter of his <lb/>
            seventeenth book.. The tres chartæ of Catullus are sup­ <lb/>
            posed to indicate that the work was in three books.</p>
          <p>2. Exemplorum libri, of which Charisius cites the second <lb/>
            book, and Aulus Gellius t the fifth. It is thought to have <lb/>
            been a work of the same nature as the subsequent compilation <lb/>
            of Valerius Maximus.</p>
          <p>3. Do Viris Illustribus, from which Gellius ‡ gives an anec­ <lb/>
            dote respecting Cato. But this may be merely another desig­ <lb/>
            nation of the preceding work, or of the Lives.</p>
          <p>4. De Vitd Ciceronis, of which Gellius § corrects an error in <lb/>
            the first book, respecting the age at which Cicero pleaded his <lb/>
            first cause.</p>
          <p>5. Epistolæ ad Ciceronem. Lactantius || gives an extract <lb/>
            from one of them. But it is not certain that they were ever <lb/>
            published in a volume by themselves.</p>
          <p>6. The younger Pliny, in one of his epistles, speaks of verses <lb/>
            made by Cornelius Nepos, but it is equally uncertain whether <lb/>
            they were a separate publication.</p>
          <p>7. A work De Historicis, mentioned in the third chapter of <lb/>
            the Life of Dion.</p>
          <p>8. A larger Life of Cato, which is mentioned at the end of <lb/>
            the existing short Life, as having been written at the request <note type="footnote"> * See also Solinus, i. 7; xliv. 1. </note><note type="footnote">vii. 18. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ ix. 8. </note><note type="footnote">§ xv. 28. </note><note type="footnote">|| Instit.

            of Atticus; but this may have been included in one of the collec­ <lb/>
            tions above mentioned. In the Guelferbytanus Codex, in­ <lb/>
            deed, the shorter Life is said to be extracted E libro Cornelia <lb/>
            Nepotis de Latinis Historicis.</p>
          <p>9. The Excellentium Imperatorum Vita appeared in the reign <lb/>
            of Theodosius I. as the work of Æmilius Probus, a grammarian, <lb/>
            who presented it to that emperor with a dedication in bad <lb/>
            Latin verse, in which he openly claims to himself the author­ <lb/>
            ship of it.</p>
          <p>Vade liber noster, fato meliore, memento, <lb/>
            Quum leget hæc Dominus, te sciat ease meum. <lb/>
            * * * * <lb/>
            Si rogat auctorem, paullatim detege nostrum <lb/>
            Tune Domino nomen; me sciat esse Probum.</p>
          <p>He says that the work was the joint production of his <lb/>
            mother or father (some copies have genetricis and others genito­ <lb/>
            ris), his grandfather, and himself. The editio princeps accord­ <lb/>
            ingly, and some subsequent editions, containing the first twenty- <lb/>
            three lives, from Miltiades to Hannibal, with the dedication to <lb/>
            Atticus prefixed, were published in the name of Æmilius Probus, <lb/>
            and nobody seems at first to have doubted that they were <lb/>
            produced as stated in the verses. But suspicions could not but <lb/>
            at length arise. Who was the Atticus to whom the preface <lb/>
            was addressed? Or why should Probus have addressed his <lb/>
            preface to any Atticus, and not to Theodosius to whom he <lb/>
            dedicated the book ? Atticus is also mentioned in the Life of <lb/>
            Hannibal as being dead, and having left writings; was this <lb/>
            the same Atticus, addressed as living in the preface, and <lb/>
            spoken of as dead in the bod of the work ?</p>
          <p>At length Peter Cornerus discovered, in a manuscript <lb/>
            containing Cicero's Letters to Atticus, the biographies of Cato <lb/>
            and Atticus, and added them to the other Lives, publishing <lb/>
            them all under the name of Æmilius Probus, in defiance of <lb/>
             <pb n="xii"/>
            internal evidence, as the writer of those pieces speaks of him­ <lb/>
            self as a contemporary and friend of Atticus; and in defiance <lb/>
            also of the inscription at the head of the manuscript, which de­ <lb/>
            clared them to be E libro posteriors Cornelii Nepotis.</p>
          <p>At last Dionysius Lambinus, undertaking an edition in 1569, <lb/>
            affixed to it a dissertation and commentary, in which he endea­ <lb/>
            voured to prove that the Lives, exhibiting matter and style <lb/>
            greatly at variance with the age of Theodosius, were not the <lb/>
            production of Æmilius Probus, but wholly Nepos's own. The <lb/>
            authority of Lambinus was such, that none ventured to question <lb/>
            his decision, until Barthius, observing that there were certain <lb/>
            solecisms and other peculiarities in the Lives which forbade <lb/>
            them to be attributed entirely to a writer of the Augustan age, <lb/>
            suggested that they were partly the work of Nepos and partly <lb/>
            that of Probus, Probus having probably abridged the original <lb/>
            performances, and introduced occasionally some matter and phra­ <lb/>
            seology of his own. This supposition will account for the strange <lb/>
            observations in the Preface, and in the Life of Epaminondas, on <lb/>
            the manners of the Greeks, and for many of the inaccuracies, <lb/>
            singular constructions, and abruptnesses of transition, of which <lb/>
            it cannot be supposed that such a writer as Cornelius Nepos <lb/>
            would have been guilty.</p>
          <p>This opinion has now been adopted by most critics. The <lb/>
            reader will find the question amply discussed by Rinckius, in a <lb/>
            dissertation prefixed to the edition of Roth, Basil, 1841, enti­ <lb/>
            tled Æmilius Probus de Excellentibus Ducibus Exterarum <lb/>
            Gentium et Cornelii Nepotis quæ supersunt. The chief histo <lb/>
            heal inaccuracies in the lives are briefly but judiciously noticed <lb/>
            by Mr. Barker in his edition of Lempriere.</p>
          <p>That the Life of Atticus is wholly the work of Cornelius <lb/>
            Nepos, has been generally acknowledged. As to the Life <lb/>
            of Cato, it may have been first abridged by Nepos himself, and <lb/>
            afterwards again by Probus. If Nepos wrote a dedication to <lb/>
             <pb n="xiii"/>
            Atticus, as we may suppose that he did, and was also the au­ <lb/>
            thor of the Life of Hannibal, we must conclude that that Life <lb/>
            was not contained in the first edition of the work. but was <lb/>
            added to it after Atticus's death</p>
          <p>Of the biography of Atticus, part was published while Atticus <lb/>
            was alive, and part after his decease..</p>
          <p>From the conclusion of the Life of Hannibal, it appears that <lb/>
            Nepos intended also to write biographies of eminent Roman <lb/>
            commanders, that their actions might be compared with those <lb/>
            of the Greeks. Whether this work was completed, we have no <lb/>
            means of knowing, but from some passages of Plutarch, who <lb/>
            cites Nepos for facts in the Lives of Lucullus and Marcelius, <lb/>
            we may suppose that at least some part of it was written</p>
          <p>There are many good editions of Cornelius Nepos, but the <lb/>
            text has perhaps never, on the whole, been presented in a better <lb/>
            state than it is given in the edition of Bos, as re-edited by <lb/>
            Fischer, Leipsic, 1806.</p>
          <p>Two or three English translations have preceded that which <lb/>
            is now offered to the public, but none of them good. Clarke's <lb/>
            is the most faithful, but the English resembles that of the rest <lb/>
            of his versions. Sir Matthew Hale translated the Life of Atti­ <lb/>
            cus, with Moral and Political Observations, published in 1677. <note type="footnote"> <unclear/> Att a 13. </note></p>

            <title type="main">NOTICE OF THE LIFE AND WRITINGS OF EUTROPIUS.</title>
          </head>
          <p>FROM Eutropius* himself we learn that he served under <lb/>
            Julian, and attended him in his expedition to the east. From <lb/>
            Georgius Codinus, de Originibus Constantinopolitanis,† we <lb/>
            find that he had previously been secretary, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιστσλογάϕος</foreign>, to <lb/>
            Constantine the Great. He was alive in the age of Valen­ <lb/>
            tinian and Valens; to the latter of whom he dedicates his <lb/>
            book. This is all that is known of his personal history.</p>
          <p>When or where he was born, it is useless to attempt to dis­ <lb/>
            cover. Suidas calls him ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ιταλὸς σοϕιστής</foreign> which we may <lb/>
            translate, an Italian eminent writer; but Suidas, as Fabricius <lb/>
            and others have observed, may merely have called him so <lb/>
            because he wrote in Latin. The authors of the Histoire <lb/>
            Littéraire de la France‡ wished to prove, from Symmachus, <lb/>
            that he was the countryman of Ausonius, and born near <lb/>
            Bourdeaux; and Vinetus, from his name and other suppo­ <lb/>
            sitions, would make him a Greek; but none of the arguments <lb/>
            in favour of either hypothesis deserve the least regard. Like <lb/>
            Justin, he has but one name; for though he is called Flavius <note type="footnote"> * Lib. x. o. 16. t Ed. Par. fol. p. 9 ; Test. Vet. apud Verheyk. </note><note type="footnote"> : Tom. i p. 22C ; Tzschucke, Prolegom. in Eutrop. p. iii., v. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xv"/>
            Eutropius by Sigonius and Boniface, the Flavius rests on no <lb/>
            sufficient authority..</p>
          <p>Some, as Vossius observes, have sought to demonstrate <lb/>
            from Gennadiust that he was a disciple of Augustin. But <lb/>
            Augustin did not flourish till the end of the fourth and begin­ <lb/>
            ning of the fifth century, at which period Eutropius must <lb/>
            either have been dead or extremely old. Others have en­ <lb/>
            deavoured to make him a Christian from what is said of <lb/>
            Julian, nimius insectator religionis Christianæ,‡ but the word <lb/>
            nimius is wanting in the best manuscripts, and, if it were <lb/>
            found in all, would be of little weight</p>
          <p>It seems, indeed, tolerably evident, that Eutropius must have <lb/>
            been, not a Christian, but a heathen. " He takes no notice," says <lb/>
            Vossius, "of the ten persecutions, and in his notice of Jovian § <lb/>
            plainly advocates dishonest dealings." But direct evidence of <lb/>
            his heathenism is given by Nicephorus Gregoras,|| one of the <lb/>
            Byzantine historians, in an oration on the character of Con­ <lb/>
            stantine the Great, in which it is observed, that what Eutropius <lb/>
            says in favour of Constantine is peculiarly deserving of atten­ <lb/>
            tion, as proceeding from a writer who must have had some <lb/>
            feeling against him in consequence of being of a different <lb/>
            religion, <foreign xml:lang="grc">διά τε τό τη̃ς θρησϰείας ἀϰοινώνητον</foreign>, and also of being <lb/>
            a contemporary and partizan of Julian, <foreign xml:lang="grc">διὰ τό ἡλιϰιώτην ϰαὶ <lb/>
            αἰρεσιώτην</foreign> ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ιουλιάνου γένεσθαι</foreign>. Nicephorus also calls him a <lb/>
            Greek or Gentile, <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἔλλην ϰαὶ ἀλλοϕύλου θρησϰείας τρόϕιμος</foreign>, and <lb/>
            speaks in such a way as to leave no doubt that the historian <lb/>
            Eutropius is meant.</p>
          <p>According to Suidas, he wrote other things besides his <lb/>
            epitome, but what they were is unknown. A Eutropius is <lb/>
            cited by Priscian as an authority for the sound of the letter x, <note type="footnote"> * Tzschucke, p. 'Tii. </note><note type="footnote">t Do Illustribus Ecclisiæ Scriptoribus. </note><note type="footnote"> t Eutrop. x. 16. </note><note type="footnote">S Eutrop. x. 17. </note><note type="footnote"> || Test.

            but no intimation is given that he was the compiler of the <lb/>
            history. Whether he executed the work in a loftier style, <lb/>
            which he promises at the end of his epitome, is uncertain.</p>
          <p>As a historian, he is guilty of some errors as to facts and <lb/>
            chronology, which are minntely particularized by Tzschucke,* <lb/>
            but is faithful on the whole, except that he omits, or colours <lb/>
            too favourably, some of the transactions that are dishonour­ <lb/>
            able to Rome.</p>
          <p>His style is correct and sufficiently polished, but exhibits <lb/>
            some words, as medietas, dubietas, and some expressions, that <lb/>
            are of the lower age of the Latin language. But when we <lb/>
            consider how late he lived, we may rather commend him for <lb/>
            having so few of such peculiarities, than blame him for those <lb/>
            that occur.</p>
          <p>His text was in a very corrupt state, until Ignatius, in 1516, <lb/>
            and Schonhovius, in 1546, exerted themselves to clear it from <lb/>
            the foreign matter that had been attached to it by Paulus <lb/>
            Diaconus and others. The best editions now are those of <lb/>
            Havercamp, 1729; Verheyk, 1762, 1793; and Tzschucke, <lb/>
            1796, 1804. Grosse also has since published a useful edition.</p>
          <p>Eutropius was twice translated into Greek, by Capito <lb/>
            Lycius, † whose version is lost, and by Pæanius, whose per­ <lb/>
            formance survives in a nearly complete state, and is printed in <lb/>
            the editions of Cellarius and Verheyk. Who Pæanius was, <lb/>
            we do not know; Sylburgius first gave the translation to the <lb/>
            press in 1590. It sometimes deviates from the sense, but is <lb/>
            in general faithful.</p>
          <p>Eutropius has been translated into English by Nicolas <lb/>
            Hayward, 1564; by Clarke. 1722, a version that has been <lb/>
            several times reprinted, and by Thomas, 1760. None of these <lb/>
            performances deserve any particular notice. <note type="footnote"> * P. xx vi seqq. </note><note type="footnote">t Suidas v. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Καπίτων</foreign>, </note></p>

          <p>AFTER many Romans,* men even of consular dignity, had <lb/>
            committed the acts of their countrymen to writing in Greek, <lb/>
            a foreign language,! Trogus Pompeius, a man of eloquence <lb/>
            equal to that of the ancients,‡ whether prompted by a desire <lb/>
            to emulate their glory, or charmed by the variety and novelty <lb/>
            of the undertaking, composed the history of Greece, and of <lb/>
            the whole world, in the Latin tongue, in order that, as our <lb/>
            actions might be read in Greek, so those of the Greeks might <lb/>
            be read in our language; attempting a work that demanded <lb/>
            extraordinary resolution and labour. For when, to most <lb/>
            authors who write the history only of particular princes or <lb/>
            nations, their task appears an affair of arduous effort, must <lb/>
            not Trogus Pompeius, in attempting the whole world, seem to <lb/>
            have acted with a boldness like that of Hercules, since in his <lb/>
            books are contained the actions of all ages, monarchs, nations, <lb/>
            and people? All that the historians of Greece had under­ <lb/>
            taken separately, according to what was suitable to each, <lb/>
            Trogus Pompeius, omitting only what was useless, has put <note type="footnote"> * Among these were Aulus Albinus, consul A.U.C. 602, Cic. Brit. c. <lb/>

            together in one narration, everything being assigned to its <lb/>
            proper period, and arranged in the regular order of events. <lb/>
            From these forty-four volumes therefore (for such was the num­ <lb/>
            ber that he published), I have extracted, during the leisure <lb/>
            that I enjoyed in the city, whatever was most worthy of being <lb/>
            known; and, rejecting such parts as were neither attractive <lb/>
            for the pleasure of reading, nor necessary by way of example, <lb/>
            have formed, as it were, a small collection of flowers, that <lb/>
            those who are acquainted with the history of Greece might <lb/>
            have something to refresh their memories, and those who are <lb/>
            strangers to it something for their instruction. This work I <lb/>
            have sent to you, * not so much that it may add to your know­ <lb/>
            ledge, as that it may receive your correction ; and that, at the <lb/>
            same time, the account of my leisure, of which Cato thinks <lb/>
            that an account must be given, may stand fair with you. For <lb/>
            your approbation is sufficient for me for the present, with the <lb/>
            expectation of receiving from posterity, when the malice of <lb/>
            detraction has died away, an ample testimony to my diligence. <note type="footnote"> * Ad te.] In the editions before that of Bongarsius, 1581, the words <lb/>
            Marce Antonine followed te, but as they did not appear in the manu­ <lb/>

            who confounded Justin the historian with Justin Martyr, who lived in <lb/>

            for their people, and, content with victory, declined to govern <lb/>
            those whom they subdued. But Ninus established the great­ <lb/>
            ness of his acquired dominion by immediately possessing <lb/>
            himself of the conquered countries.* Overcoming, accord­ <lb/>
            ingly, the nearest people, and advancing, fortified with an <lb/>
            accession of strength, against others, while each successive <lb/>
            victory became the instrument of one to follow, he subjugated <lb/>
            the nations of the whole east. His last war was with Zoro­ <lb/>
            aster,† king of the Bactrians, who is said to have been the <lb/>
            first that invented magic arts, and to have investigated, with <lb/>
            great attention, the origin of the world and the motions of the <lb/>
            stars. After killing Zoroaster, Ninus himself died, leaving a <lb/>
            son called Ninyas, still a minor, and a wife, whose name was <lb/>
            Semiramis.t</p>
          <p>II. Semiramis, not daring to entrust the government to a <lb/>
            youth, or openly to take it upon herself (as so many great <lb/>
            nations would scarcely submit to one man, much less to <lb/>
            a woman), pretended that she was the son of Ninus instead of <lb/>
            his wife, a male instead of a female. The stature of both <lb/>
            mother and son was low, their voice alike weak, and the cast <lb/>
            of their features similar. She accordingly clad her arms and <lb/>
            legs in long garments, and decked her head with a turban ; <lb/>
            and, that she might not appear to conceal any thing by this <lb/>
            new dress, she ordered her subjects also to wear the same <lb/>
            apparel; a fashion which the whole nation has since retained. <lb/>
            Having thus dissembled her sex at the commencement of her <note type="footnote"> * Continuâ possessione.] His establishment of his power over the <lb/>

            overcome by the greatness of them, she acknowledged who she <lb/>
            was, and whom she had personated. Nor did this confession <lb/>
            detract from her authority as a sovereign, but increased the <lb/>
            admiration of her, since she, being a woman, surpassed, not <lb/>
            only women, but men, in heroism.</p>
          <p>It was she that built Babylon,* and constructed round the <lb/>
            city a wall of burnt brick; bitumen, a substance which every­ <lb/>
            where oozes from the ground in those parts, being spread <lb/>
            between the bricks instead of mortar.t Many other famous <lb/>
            acts, too, were performed by this queen; for, not content with <lb/>
            preserving the territories acquired by her husband, she added <lb/>
            Ethiopia also to her empire; and she even made war upon <lb/>
            India, into which no prince,‡ except her and Alexander the <lb/>
            Great, ever penetrated. At last, conceiving a criminal passion <lb/>
            for her son, she was killed by him, after holding the kingdom <lb/>
            two and forty years from the death of Ninus.</p>
          <p>Her son Ninyas, content with the empire acquired by his <lb/>
            parents, laid aside the pursuits of war, and, as if he had changed <lb/>
            sexes with his mother, was seldom seen by men, but grew old <lb/>
            in the company of his women. His successors too, following <lb/>
            his example, gave answers to their people through their <lb/>
            ministers. The Assyrians, who were afterwards called Syrians, <lb/>

            named Arbaces, governor of the Medes, having, with great <lb/>
            difficulty and after much solicitation, obtained admission to <lb/>

            distributing tasks to girls, but surpassing all the women in the <lb/>
            effeminacy of his person and the wantonness of his looks. At <lb/>
            that sight, feeling indignant that so many men should be <lb/>
            subject to one so much of a woman, and that those who bore <lb/>
            swords and arms should obey one that handled wool, he pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded to his companions, and told them what he had seen, <lb/>
            protesting that he could not submit to a prince who had rather <lb/>
            be a woman than a man. A conspiracy was consequently formed, <lb/>
            and war raised against Sardanapalus; who, hearing of what <lb/>
            had occurred, and acting, not like a man that would defend <lb/>
            his kingdom, but as women are wont to do under fear of <lb/>
            death, first looked about for a hiding-place, but afterwards <lb/>
            marched into the field with a few ill-disciplined troops. Being <lb/>
            conquered in battle, he withdrew into his palace, and, <lb/>
            having raised and set fire to a pile of combustibles, threw <lb/>
            himself and his riches into the flames, in this respect only <lb/>
            acting like a man. After him Arbaces, who was the occasion <lb/>
            of his death, and who had been governor of the Medes, was <lb/>
            made king, and transferred the empire from the Assyrians to <lb/>
            the Medes.</p>
          <p>IV. After several kings, the crown, by order of succession, <lb/>
            descended to Astyages. This prince, in a dream, saw a <lb/>
            vine spring from the womb of his only daughter, with the <lb/>
            branches of which all Asia was overshadowed. The sooth­ <lb/>
            sayers being consulted concerning the vision, replied, that he <lb/>
            would have a grandson by that daughter, whose greatness was <lb/>
            foreshown, and the loss of Astyages's kingdom portended. <lb/>
            Alarmed at this answer, he gave his daughter in marriage, not <lb/>
            to an eminent man, nor to one of his own subjects (lest <lb/>
            nobility on the father or mother's side should rouse the spirit <lb/>
            of his grandson), but to Cambyses, a man of mean fortune, <lb/>
            and of the race of the Persians, which was at that time <lb/>
            obscure. But not having, even thus, got rid of his fear of <lb/>
            the dream, he sent for his daughter, while she was pregnant, <lb/>
            that her child might be put to death under the very eye of <lb/>
            his grandfather. The infant, as soon as it was born, was given <lb/>
            to Harpagus, a friend of the king's and in his secrets, to be <lb/>
            killed. Harpagus, fearing that if the crown, on the death of <lb/>
            the king (as Astyages had no male issue), should devolve upon <lb/>
            his daughter, she might exact from the agent, for the murder <lb/>
            of her child, that revenge which she could not inflict on her <pb n="7"/>
            <note type="margin"> B.C. 561] </note> <lb/>
            father, gave the infant to the herdsman of the king's cattle to <lb/>
            be exposed. The herdsman, by chance, had a son born at the <lb/>
            same time ; and his wife, hearing of the exposure of the royal <lb/>
            infant, entreated, with the utmost earnestness, that the child <lb/>
            might be brought and shown to her. The herdsman, over­ <lb/>
            come by her solicitations, went back into the wood, and found <lb/>
            a dog by the infant, giving it her teats, and protecting it from <lb/>
            the beasts and birds of prey. Being moved with pity, with <lb/>
            which he saw even a dog moved, he carried the child to the <lb/>
            cattle-folds, the dog vigilantly following him. When the <lb/>
            woman took the babe into her hands, it smiled upon her as if <lb/>
            it knew her ; and there appeared so much vivacity in it, with <lb/>
            a certain sweetness in its smile as it clung to her. that the wife <lb/>
            at once entreated the herdsman to expose her own child <lb/>
            instead of the other, and to allow her to bring up the royal <lb/>
            infant, whether to his own fortune or to her hopes.* Thus <lb/>
            the lot of the children being changed, the one was brought <lb/>
            up as the shepherd's son, and the other exposed as the king's <lb/>
            grandson. The nurse had afterwards the name of Space ; for <lb/>
            so the Persians call a dog.</p>
          <p>V. The boy after a time, while he was among the shepherds, <lb/>
            received the name of Cyrus. Subsequently, being chosen by <lb/>
            lot king among his play-fellows, and having boldly scourged <lb/>
            such of them as were disobedient to him, a complaint was <lb/>
            made to the king by the parents of the boys, who were angry <lb/>
            that free-born youths should be lashed with servile stripes by <lb/>
            the king's slave. Astyages having sent for the boy and <lb/>
            questioned him, and the boy replying, without any change of <lb/>
            countenance, that “ he had acted as a king," was struck with <lb/>
            his high spirit, and reminded of his dream and its interpre­ <lb/>
            tation. In consequence, as both the resemblance of his <lb/>
            features, the time of his exposure, and the confession of the <lb/>
            herdsman, concurred exactly, he acknowledged him as his <lb/>
            grandson. And since he seemed to have had his dream <lb/>
            accomplished, by the boy's exercise of rule among the shep­ <lb/>
            herds, he subdued his feelings of animosity; but with regard <lb/>
            to him only; for, being incensed with his friend Harpagus, he, <lb/>
            in revenge for the preservation of his grandson, killed his son, <note type="footnote"> * Sive fortunes ipsius sive spei sum puerum nutrire.] She hoped that <lb/>
            the child would be restored to the regal station or fortune in which it <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B.I. CH.VI. </note> <lb/>
            and gave him to his father to eat. Harpagus, dissembling <lb/>
            his resentment for the present, deferred showing his malice <lb/>
            towards the king, until a proper time for vengeance should <lb/>
            occur.</p>
          <p>Some time having elapsed, and Cyrus being grown up, <lb/>
            Harpagus, prompted by his resentment for the loss of his <lb/>
            child, wrote him an account how he had been banished to the <lb/>
            Persians by his grandfather; how his grandfather had ordered <lb/>
            him to be killed when he was an infant; how he had been <lb/>
            saved by his kindness; how he himself had incurred the king's <lb/>
            displeasure, and how he had lost his son. He exhorted him <lb/>
            to raise an army, and march directly to seize the throne, <lb/>
            promising that the Medes should join him. This letter, <lb/>
            because it could not be conveyed openly, as the king's guards <lb/>
            occupied all the roads, was enclosed in the body of a hare, of <lb/>
            which the bowels had been taken out; and the hare was corn <lb/>
            mitted to a trusty slave, to be carried into Persia to Cyrus. <lb/>
            Nets were also given him, that the plot might be concealed <lb/>
            under the appearance of a hunting expedition.</p>
          <p>VI. Cyrus, after reading the letter, was exhorted in a dream <lb/>
            to make the same attempt; but was also admonished to take <lb/>
            the first man that he should meet on the following day, as <lb/>
            a companion in his enterprize. Commencing his journey <lb/>
            from the country, accordingly, before it was light, he met a <lb/>
            slave named Sœbaris, coming from the slave-house of a certain <lb/>
            Mede. Having questioned him as to his birth-place, and <lb/>
            hearing that he was born in Persia, he knocked off his fetters, <lb/>
            took him with him as his companion, and returned to Per­ <lb/>
            sepolis. Here, having called the people together, he ordered <lb/>
            them all to attend him with axes, and to cut down a wood <lb/>
            that skirted each side of the road. When they had thoroughly <lb/>
            accomplished this, he invited them on the following day to <lb/>
            a feast prepared for them. Then, as soon as he saw them <lb/>
            exhilarated with the banquet, he asked them, “ if an offer <lb/>
            were made them, which sort of life they would choose, a life of <lb/>
            labour like that of yesterday, or of feasting like the present ? " <lb/>
            As they all exclaimed, “A life of feasting like the present," <lb/>
            he told them that, “ as long as they obeyed the Medes, they <lb/>
            must lead a life like the drudgery of yesterday; but, if they <lb/>
            would follow him, a life like the present entertainment." All <lb/>
            expressing their joy, he made war upon the Medea. <pb n="9"/>
            <note type="margin"> B.C. 550.] </note> </p>
          <p>Astyages, forgetting his treatment of Harpagus, entrusted <lb/>
            him with the management of the war. Harpagus immediately <lb/>
            delivered up the forces, which he had received from Astyages, <lb/>
            to Cyrus, and took revenge for the king's cruelty by a <lb/>
            treacherous desertion of him. Astyages, hearing of this <lb/>
            occurrence, and collecting troops from all quarters, marched <lb/>
            against the Persians in person. Having vigorously renewed <lb/>
            the contest, he posted part of his army, while his men were <lb/>
            fighting, in their rear, and ordered that those who turned back <lb/>
            should be driven on the enemy with the point of the sword; <lb/>
            telling them that, “unless they conquered, they would find men <lb/>
            in their rear not less stout than those in their front; and they <lb/>
            were therefore to consider whether they would penetrate the <lb/>
            one body by fleeing, or the other body by fighting." In <lb/>
            consequence of this obligation to fight, great spirit and vigour <lb/>
            was infused into his army. As the Persian troops, therefore, <lb/>
            were driven back, and were gradually retiring, their mothers <lb/>
            and wives ran to meet them, and besought them to return to <lb/>
            the field. While they hesitated, they took up their garments, <lb/>
            and showed them the secret parts of their persons, asking <lb/>
            them, “ if they would shrink back into the wombs of their <lb/>
            mothers or their wives." Checked with this reproach, they <lb/>
            returned to the battle, and, making a vigorous assault, <lb/>
            compelled those from whom they had fled to flee in their turn. <lb/>
            In this battle Astyages was taken prisoner; from whom Cyrus <lb/>
            took nothing but his kingdom, and, acting towards him the <lb/>
            part rather of a grandson than of a conqueror, made him ruler <lb/>
            of the powerful nation of the Hyrcanians; for to the Medes he <lb/>
            was unwilling to return. Such was the termination of the <lb/>
            empire of the Medes, who had ruled three hundred and fifty <lb/>
            years.</p>
          <p>VII. In the beginning of his reign, Cyrus appointed <lb/>
            Sœbaris (his companion in his undertakings, whom, in <lb/>
            conformity with his dream, he had released from the slave- <lb/>
            house, and made a sharer in all his enterprises), governor of <lb/>
            Persia, and gave him his sister in marriage But several <lb/>
            cities, which had been tributary to the Medes, thinking that <lb/>
            their condition was changed by this change in the government, <lb/>
            revolted from Cyrus; a revolt which was the occasion and <lb/>
            source of many wars against him. When he had at length, <lb/>
            however, reduced most of them to submission, and was carrying <pb n="10"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.I. CH.VII"/> <lb/>
            on war against the Babylonians, Croesus, king of Lydia, whose <lb/>
            power and riches were at that time extraordinary, came to the <lb/>
            aid of that people, but, being soon defeated and abandoned, <lb/>
            fled back to his kingdom. Cyrus, after his victory, as soon as <lb/>
            he had settled affairs in Babylonia, transferred the war into <lb/>
            Lydia, where he easily routed the army of Crœsus, already <lb/>
            dispirited by the event of the former battle. Crœsus himself <lb/>
            was taken prisoner. But in proportion to the smallness of the <lb/>
            danger in the battle, was the greatness of the clemency shown <lb/>
            by Cyrus on his victory. To Crœsus was granted his life, <lb/>
            part of his hereditary possessions, and the city Barene,* in <lb/>
            which he lived, though not the life of a king, yet one scarcely <lb/>
            inferior to royal dignity. This lenity was of no less advantage <lb/>
            to the conqueror than to the conquered; for when it was <lb/>
            known that war was made upon Crœsus, auxiliaries flocked to <lb/>
            him from the whole of Greece,† as if to extinguish a <lb/>
            conflagration that threatened them all; so popular was Crœsus <lb/>
            in all the Greek cities; and Cyrus would have incurred a <lb/>
            heavy war with Greece, if he had resolved on any severe <lb/>
            treatment of Crœsus.</p>
          <p>Some time after, when Cyrus was engaged in other wars, the <lb/>
            Lydians rebelled, and, being a second time conquered, their <lb/>
            arms and horses were taken from them, and they were compelled <lb/>
            to keep taverns, to turn their thoughts to amusements, and <lb/>
            open houses of pleasure. Thus a nation, formerly powerful <lb/>
            through its industry, and brave in the field, was rendered <lb/>
            effeminate by ease and luxury, and lost its ancient spirit; and <lb/>
            those whom their wars had proved invincible till the time of <lb/>
            Cyrus, idleness and sloth overpowered when they had fallen <lb/>
            into dissoluteness of manners.</p>
          <p>The Lydians had many kings before Crœsus, remarkable for <lb/>
            various turns of fate; but none to be compared, in singularity <note type="footnote"> * This word has been received into the text instead of the old <lb/>

            of fortune, to Candaules. This prince used to speak of his wife, <lb/>
            on whom he doated for her extreme beauty, to every body, for <lb/>
            he was not content with the quiet consciousness of his happiness, <lb/>
            unless he also published the secrets of his married life ; just as <lb/>
            if silence concerning her beauty had been a detraction from it. <lb/>
            At last, to gain credit to his representations, he showed her <lb/>
            undressed to his confidant, Gyges; an act by which he both <lb/>
            rendered his friend, who was thus tempted to corrupt his wife, <lb/>
            his enemy, and alienated his wife from him, by transferring, as <lb/>
            it were, her love to another; for, soon after, the murder of <lb/>
            Candaules was stipulated as the condition of her marriage with <lb/>
            Gyges, and the wife, making her husbands blood her dowry, <lb/>
            bestowed at once his kingdom and herself on her paramour.</p>
          <p>VIII. Cyrus, after subduing Asia,. and reducing the whole <lb/>
            of the east under his power, made war upon the Scythians. <lb/>
            At that time, the Scythians were ruled by a queen named <lb/>
            Tomyris, who, not alarmed like a woman at the approach of an <lb/>
            enemy, suffered them to pass the river Araxes, though she <lb/>
            might have hindered them from passing it; thinking that it <lb/>
            would be easier for her to fight within the limits of her kingdom, <lb/>
            and that escape would be harder for the enemy from the <lb/>
            obstruction of the river. Cyrus accordingly, having carried his <lb/>
            troops across, and advanced some distance into Scythia, pitched <lb/>
            his camp. On the day following, having quitted his camp in <lb/>
            pretended alarm, and as if in full flight, he left behind him <lb/>
            abundance of wine, and such things as were proper for a feast. <lb/>
            The news of this event being brought to the queen, she <lb/>
            despatched her son, a very young man, with a third part of her <lb/>
            army, in pursuit of him. When they reached the camp of <lb/>
            Cyrus, the youth, inexperienced in military matters, seeming to <lb/>
            think he was come to feast and not to fight, paid no attention <lb/>
            to the enemy, but allowed his barbarians, who were unused to <lb/>
            wine, to overload themselves with it; so that the Scythian? <lb/>
            were overcome with wine before they were subdued by the <lb/>
            enemy; for Cyrus, learning what had happened, and returning <lb/>
            in the night, fell upon them unawares,† and killed all the <lb/>
            Scythians together with the queen's son. <note type="footnote"> it That is, the kingdom of Lydia, which included almost all Asia <lb/>

          <p>But Tomyris, afte: losing so great an army, and, what she <lb/>
            still more lamented, her only son, did not pour forth her <lb/>
            sorrow for her loss in tears, but turned her thoughts to the <lb/>
            solace of revenge, and entrapped her enemies, exulting in <lb/>
            their recent victory, by a deception and stratagem similar <lb/>
            to their own. For, counterfeiting timidity on account of the <lb/>
            damage which she had received, and taking to flight, she <lb/>
            allured Cyrus into a narrow defile, where, placing an ambush <lb/>
            on the hills, she slew two hundred thousand of the Persians <lb/>
            with their king himself; a triumph in which this also was <lb/>
            remarkable, that not a man to tell of such a massacre survived. <lb/>
            The queen ordered the head of Cyrus to be cut off and thrown <lb/>
            into a vessel full of human blood, adding this exclamation <lb/>
            against his cruelty, “ Satiate thyself with blood for which thou <lb/>
            hast thirsted, and of which thou hast always been insatiable." <lb/>
            Cyrus reigned thirty years, and was a man wonderfully dis­ <lb/>
            tinguished, not only in the beginning of his reign, but during <lb/>
            the whole course of his life.</p>
          <p>IX. He was succeeded by his son Cambyses, who added <lb/>
            Egypt to his father's dominions, but, disgusted at the super­ <lb/>
            stitions of the Egyptians, ordered the temples of Apis and the <lb/>
            other gods to be demolished. He also sent an army to destroy <lb/>
            the celebrated temple of Ammou; which army was over­ <lb/>
            whelmed with tempests and heaps of sand, and utterly <lb/>
            annihilated. Afterwards he learned in a dream that his <lb/>
            brother Smerdis was to be king. Alarmed at this vision, he <lb/>
            did not scruple to add fratricide *to sacrilege ; nor was it to <lb/>
            be expected, indeed, that he, who, in contempt of religion, <lb/>
            had braved the gods themselves, would spare his own relations. <lb/>
            To execute this cruel service, he selected from his confidants <lb/>
            a man named Prexaspes, one of the Magi. But in the mean <lb/>
            time, he himself, being severely hurt in the thigh by his sword, <lb/>
            which had started out of its sheathe died of the wound, and <note type="footnote"> sopitos. Though it should be observed that Justin, xxiv. 8, has mero <lb/>

            miraculous in the unsheathing of the sword. Herodotus, iii. 64, says <lb/>
            the sword fell from the sheath by accident, the cap at the end of the <lb/>
            sheath having dropped off; observing, however, that the occurrence </note> <pb n="13"/>
            <note type="margin"> B.C. 521.] </note> <lb/>
            paid the penalty whether of the fratricide which he had <lb/>
            intended, or of the sacrilege which he had perpetrated. The <lb/>
            Magus, receiving intelligence of this event, despatched his <lb/>
            commission before the report of the king's death was spread <lb/>
            abroad, and, having killed Smerdis, to whom the kingdom <lb/>
            belonged, set up in his room his own brother Orospastes, who <lb/>
            closely resembled him in features and person, and, no one <lb/>
            suspecting any imposture in the case, Orospastes was declared <lb/>
            king instead of Smerdis. This transaction was the more <lb/>
            easily kept secret, as, among the Persians, the person of <lb/>
            the king is concealed from public view, under pretext of <lb/>
            keeping his majesty inviolate. The Magi,. to gain the favour <lb/>
            of the people, granted a remission of the taxes, and an im­ <lb/>
            munity from military service, for three years, that they might <lb/>
            secure by indulgence and bounties the kingdom which they <lb/>
            had gained by fraud. The imposition was first suspected by <lb/>
            Otanes, a man of noble birth, and extremely happy in forming <lb/>
            conjectures. He accordingly, by the aid of certain agents, <lb/>
            inquired of his daughter, who was one of the royal concubines, <lb/>
            whether the son of king Cyrus was now king. She replied <lb/>
            that " she neither knew, nor could learn from any other woman, <lb/>
            as all the females were shut up in separate apartments." <lb/>
            He then desired her to feel his head while he was asleep ; as <lb/>
            Cambyses had cut off both the Magus's ears. Being then <lb/>
            assured by his daughter that " the king was without ears," he <lb/>
            disclosed the affair to some of the Persian noblemen, and, <lb/>
            having persuaded them to murder the pretended king, bound <lb/>
            them to the commission of the deed by a solemn oath. To <lb/>
            this conspiracy seven only were privy, who at once (lest if <lb/>
            time were allowed for change of mind, the affair should be <lb/>
            made public by any one) proceeded to the palace with swords <lb/>
            hidden under their garments. Here, having killed all that <lb/>
            they met, they made their way to the Magi, who indeed did <lb/>
            not want courage to defend themselves, for they drew their <lb/>
            swords and killed two of the conspirators. They were over­ <lb/>
            powered, however, by numbers. Gobryas, having seized one <lb/>
            of them by the waist, and his companions hesitating to use <note type="footnote"> took place on the spot where Cambyses had previously wounded the <lb/>

            their swords, lest, as the affair was transacted in the dark, <lb/>
            they should stab him instead of the Magus, desired them to <lb/>
            thrust the weapon into the Magus even through his body ; but, <lb/>
            as good fortune directed, the Magus was slain, and Gobryas <lb/>
            escaped unhurt</p>
          <p>X. The Magi being slain, the glory of the noblemen, in <lb/>
            having recovered the kingdom, was indeed great, but proved <lb/>
            far greater in this, that when they came to debate about the <lb/>
            disposal of it, they were able to act in concert. They were <lb/>
            so equal in merit and nobility of birth, that their very equality <lb/>
            would have rendered it hard for the people to make a selection <lb/>
            from them. They themselves, therefore, contrived a method <lb/>
            by which they might refer the judgment respecting them to <lb/>
            religion- and fortune, and agreed that, on an appointed day, <lb/>
            they should all bring their horses early in the morning before <lb/>
            the palace, and that he whose horse should neigh first, on <lb/>
            the rising of the sun,f should be king. For the Persians <lb/>
            believe the sun to be the only god, and regard horses as <lb/>
            sacred to the god. Among the conspirators was Darius the <lb/>
            son of Hystaspes, to whom, when he felt anxious about his <lb/>
            chance of the kingdom, his groom said that, “ if that matter <lb/>
            was the only obstacle to his success, there would not be the <lb/>
            least difficulty about it." The groom then took the horse, in <lb/>
            the night before the appointed day, to the place agreed upon, <lb/>
            and there let him cover a mare, thinking that from the pleasure <lb/>
            of the leap would result what actually came to pass. On the <lb/>
            next day, accordingly, when they were all met at the appointed <lb/>
            hour, the horse of Darius, recognizing the place, set up a <lb/>
            neigh from desire for the mare, and, while the other horses <lb/>
            were silent, was the first to give a fortunate signal for his <lb/>
            master. Such was the moderation of the other nobles, that <lb/>
            when they heard the omen, they immediately leaped from their <lb/>
            horses, and saluted Darius as king. The whole people too, <lb/>
            following the judgment of their chiefs, acknowledged him as <lb/>
            their ruler. Thus the kingdom of the Persians, recovered by <note type="footnote"> * Religioni.] To the gods, who might signify their will by omens. <lb/>

            the valour of seven of its noblest men, was by so easy a mode <lb/>
            of decision conferred upon one of them. It is incredible <lb/>
            that they should have resigned, with so much patience, their <lb/>
            pretensions to a kingdom, for which, in order to recover it <lb/>
            from the Magi, they had not hesitated to expose their lives. <lb/>
            However, besides possessing gracefulness of person, and merit <lb/>
            deserving of such an empire, Darius was related to the <lb/>
            preceding kings ; and, in the beginning of his reign, he took <lb/>
            to wife the daughter of Cyrus, in order to strengthen his <lb/>
            kingdom by a royal marriage, so that it might not so much <lb/>
            seem transferred to a stranger, as to be restored to Cyrus's <lb/>
            family.</p>
          <p>Some time after, when the Assyrians had revolted and <lb/>
            seized upon Babylon, and the capture of the city proved <lb/>
            difficult, so that the king was in great anxiety about it, <lb/>
            Zopyrus, one of the assassins of the Magi, caused himself to <lb/>
            be mangled with stripes, in his own house, over his whole <lb/>
            body, and his nose, ears, and lips to be cut off, and in this <lb/>
            condition presented himself unexpectedly before the king; <lb/>
            when he privately informed Darius, who was astonished, and <lb/>
            inquired the cause and author of so dire an outrage, with what <lb/>
            object he had done it, and, having settled his plan of action <lb/>
            for the future, set out for Babylon in the character of a <lb/>
            deserter. There he showed the people his lacerated body; <lb/>
            complained of the barbarity of the king, by whom, in the <lb/>
            competition for the throne, he had been defeated, not by <lb/>
            merit but by fortune, not by the judgment of men but by <lb/>
            the neighing of a horse; and bade them form an opinion, <lb/>
            from his treatment of his friends, what was to be apprehended <lb/>
            by his enemies; exhorting them not to trust to their walls <lb/>
            more than to their arms, and to allow him, whose resentment <lb/>
            was fresher, to carry on the war in common with them. The <lb/>
            nobleness and bravery of the man was known to them all: <lb/>
            nor did they doubt of his sincerity, of which they had the <lb/>
            wounds on his person, and the marks of his ill-usage, as <lb/>
            proofs. He was therefore chosen general by the suffrages of <lb/>
            all; and, having received a small body of men, and the <lb/>
            Persians, once or twice, purposely retreating from the field, he <lb/>
            fought some successful battles. At last he betrayed the whole <lb/>
            army, with which he had been entrusted, to Darius, and <lb/>
            brought the city under his power. Some time after, Darius <pb n="16"/>

          <p>I. IN narrating the acts of the Scythians, which were very <lb/>
            great and glorious, we must commence from their origin ; <lb/>
            for they had a rise not less illustrious than their empire ; nor <lb/>
            were they more famous for the government of their men than <lb/>
            for the brave actions of their women. As the men were <lb/>
            founders of the Parthians and Bactrians, the women settled <lb/>
            the kingdom of the Amazons; so that to those who compare <lb/>
            the deeds of their males and females, it is difficult to decide <lb/>
            which of the sexes was more distinguished.</p>
          <p>The nation of the Scythians was always regarded as very <lb/>
            ancient; though there was long a dispute between them and <lb/>
            the Egyptians concerning the antiquity of their respective <lb/>
            races; the Egyptians alleging that, “ In the beginning oi <lb/>
            things, when some countries were parched with the excessive <lb/>
            heat of the sun, and others frozen with extremity of cold, so <lb/>
            that, in their early condition, they were not only unable to <lb/>
            produce human beings, but were incapable even of receiving <lb/>
            and supporting such as came from other parts (before coverings <lb/>
            for the body were found out against heat and cold, or the moon­ <lb/>
            veniences of countries corrected by artificial remedies), Egypt <lb/>
            was always so temperate, that neither the cold in winter nor <lb/>
            the sun's heat in summer, incommoded its inhabitants; <lb/>
            and its soil so fertile, that no land was ever more productive of <lb/>
            food for the use of man; and that, consequently, men must <lb/>
             <pb n="17"/>
            reasonably be considered to have been first produced in that <lb/>
            country,* where they could most easily be nourished."</p>
          <p>The Scythians, on the other hand, thought that the tem <lb/>
            perateness of the air was no argument of antiquity; " because <lb/>
            Nature, when she first distributed to different countries degrees <lb/>
            of heat and cold, immediately produced in them animals fitted <lb/>
            to endure the several climates, and generated also numerous <lb/>
            sorts of trees and herbs, happily varied according to the con­ <lb/>
            dition of the places in which they grew; and that, as the <lb/>
            Scythians have a sharper air than the Egyptians, so are their <lb/>
            bodies and constitutions in proportion more hardy. But that <lb/>
            if the world, which is now distinguished into parts of a different <lb/>
            nature, was once uniform throughout; whether a deluge of <lb/>
            waters originally kept the earth buried under it; or whether <lb/>
            fire, which also produced the world,† had possession of all the <lb/>
            parts of it, the Scythians, under either supposition as to tne <lb/>
            primordial state of things, had the advantage as to origin. <lb/>
            For if fire was at first predominant over all things, and, being <lb/>
            gradually extinguished, gave place to the earth, no part of it <lb/>
            would be sooner separated from the fire, by the severity of <lb/>
            winter cold, than the northern, since even now no part is more <lb/>
            frozen with cold; but Egypt and all the east must have been <lb/>
            the latest to cool, as being now burnt up with the parching <lb/>
            heat of the sun. But if originally all the earth were sunk <lb/>
            under water, assuredly the highest parts would be first <lb/>
            uncovered when the waters decreased, and the water must <lb/>
            have remained longest in the lowest grounds; while the <lb/>
            sooner any portion of the earth was dry, the sooner it must <lb/>
            have begun to produce animals; but Scythia was so much <lb/>
            higher than all other countries, that all the rivers which rise <lb/>
            in it run down into the Mæotis, and then into the Pontic and <lb/>
            Egyptian seas; whereas Egypt, (which, though it had been <lb/>
            fenced by the care and expense of so many princes and gene­ <lb/>
            rations, and furnished with such strong mounds against the <lb/>
            violence of the encroaching waters, and though it had been <lb/>
            intersected also by so many canals, the waters being kept <lb/>

            thought to have been the most anciently peopled;† being <lb/>
            a land, which, whether from the accessions of soil col­ <lb/>
            lected by its kings, or those from the Nile, bringing mud with <lb/>
            it, must appear to have been the most recently formed of all <lb/>
            lands." The Egyptians being confounded with these argu­ <lb/>
            meats, the Scythians were always accounted the more ancient.</p>
          <p>II. Scythia, which stretches towards the east, is bounded on <lb/>
            one side by the Pontus Euxinus; on the other, by the <lb/>
            Rhipæan Mountains; at the back,‡ by Asiai and the river <lb/>
            Phasis. It extends to a vast distance, both in length and <lb/>
            breadth. The people have no landmarks, for they neither <lb/>
            cultivate the soil, nor have they any house, dwelling, or settled <lb/>
            place of abode, but are always engaged in feeding herds and <lb/>
            flocks, and wandering through uncultivated deserts. They <lb/>
            carry their wives and children with them in waggons,|| which, <lb/>
            as they are covered with hides against the rain and cold, they <lb/>
            use instead of houses. Justice is observed among them, more <lb/>
            from the temper of the people, than from the influence of <lb/>
            laws. No crime in their opinion is more heinous than theft; <lb/>
            for, among people that keep their flocks and herds without <lb/>
            fence or shelter in the woods, what would be safe, if stealing <lb/>
            were permitted ? Gold and silver they despise, as much as <lb/>
            other men covet them. They live on milk and honey. The <lb/>
            use of wool and clothes is unknown among them, although <lb/>
            they are pinched by perpetual cold; they wear, however, the <lb/>
            skins of wild animals, great and small.¶ Such abstemiousness <note type="footnote"> * Nisi exluso Nilo.] Excluded from the land, or confined to its <lb/>

            has caused justice to be observed among them, as they covet <lb/>
            nothing belonging to their neighbours; for it is only where <lb/>
            riches are of use, that the desire of them prevails. And <lb/>
            would that other men had like temperance, and like freedom <lb/>
            from desire for the goods of others! There would then <lb/>
            assuredly be fewer wars in all ages and countries, and the sword <lb/>
            would not destroy more than the natural course of destiny. <lb/>
            And it appears extremely wonderful, that nature should grant <lb/>
            that to them which the Greeks cannot attain by long instruc­ <lb/>
            tion from their wise men and the precepts of their philo­ <lb/>
            sophers ; and that cultivated morals should have the disadvan­ <lb/>
            tage in a comparison with those of unpolished barbarians. So <lb/>
            much better effect has the ignorance of vice in the one people <lb/>
            than the knowledge of virtue in the other.</p>
          <p>III. They thrice * aspired to the supreme command in Asia; <lb/>
            while they themselves remained always either unmolested or <lb/>
            unconquered by any foreign power. Darius, king of the Per­ <lb/>
            sians, they forced to quit Scythia in disgraceful flight. They <lb/>
            slew Cyrus with his whole army. They cut off in like manner <lb/>
            Zopyrion, a general of Alexander the Great, with all his <lb/>
            forces. Of the arms of the Romans they have heard, but <lb/>
            never felt them. They founded the Parthian and Bactrian <lb/>
            powers. They are a nation hardy in toils and warfare : their <lb/>
            strength of body is extraordinary; they take possession of <lb/>
            nothing which they fear to lose, and covet, when they are <lb/>
            conquerors, nothing but glory.</p>
          <p>The first that proclaimed war against the Scythians was <lb/>
            Sesostris, king of Egypt, previously sending messengers t to <lb/>
            announce conditions on which they might become his subjects. <lb/>
            But the Scythians, who were already apprized by their neigh­ <lb/>
            bours of the king's approach, made answer to the deputies, <lb/>
            that the prince of so rich a people had been foolish in com­ <lb/>
            mencing a war with a poor one (for war was more to be <lb/>
            dreaded by himself at home), as the result of the contest was <lb/>
            uncertain, prizes of victory there were none, and the ill con­ <lb/>
            sequences of defeat were apparent; and that the Scythians, <note type="footnote"> • One expedition only is mentioned by Herodotus.—Wetzel. </note><note type="footnote"> t Lononibus.] Messenger, mediator, or conciliator, seems to have <lb/>

            therefore, would not wait till he came to them, since there was <lb/>
            so much more to be desired in the hands of the enemy, but <lb/>
            would proceed of their own accord to seek the spoil." Nor <lb/>
            were their deeds slower than their words; and the king, <lb/>
            hearing that they were advancing with such speed, took to flight,. <lb/>
            and leaving behind him his army and all his military stores, <lb/>
            returned in consternation to his own kingdom. The morasses <lb/>
            prevented the Scythians from invading Egypt; in their <lb/>
            retreat from which they subdued Asia, and made it tributary, <lb/>
            imposing, however, only a moderate tribute, rather as a token <lb/>
            of their power over it, than as a recompence for their victory. <lb/>
            After spending fifteen years in the reduction of Asia, they <lb/>
            were called home by the importunity of their wives, who sent <lb/>
            them word that " unless their husbands returned, they would <lb/>
            seek issue from their neighbours, and not suffer the race of the <lb/>
            Scythians to fail of posterity through the fault of their <lb/>
            women." Asia was tributary to them for fifteen hundred <lb/>
            years; and it was Ninus, king of Assyria, that put a stop to <lb/>
            the payment of the tribute.</p>
          <p>IV. Among the Scythians, in the meantime, two youths † <lb/>
            of royal extraction, Ylinos and Scolopitus, being driven from <lb/>
            their country by a faction of the nobility, took with them a <lb/>
            numerous band of young men, and found a settlement on the <lb/>
            coast of Cappadocia, near the river Thermodon, occupying the <lb/>
            Themiscyrian plains that border on it. Here, making it their <lb/>
            practice for several years to rob their neighbours, they were at <lb/>
            last, by a combination of the surrounding people, cut to pieces <lb/>
            in an ambuscade. Their wives, when they found that to exile <lb/>
            was added the loss of their husbands, took arms themselves, <lb/>
            and maintained their position, repelling the attacks of their <lb/>
            enemies at first, and afterwards assailing them in return. <lb/>
            They relinquished all thoughts of marrying with their neigh­ <lb/>
            bours, saying that it would be slavery, not matrimony. Ven­ <lb/>
            turing to set an example unimitated through all generations. <lb/>
            they established their government without the aid of men, and <note type="footnote"> * Herodotus, on the contrary, with Diodorus Siculus, and Dicæar- <lb/>

            soon maintained their power in defiance of them. And that <lb/>
            none of their females might seem more fortunate than others, <lb/>
            they put to death all the men who had remained at home. <lb/>
            They also took revenge for their husbands that were killed in <lb/>
            wart by a great slaughter of their neighbours.</p>
          <p>Having thus secured peace by means of their arms, they <lb/>
            proceeded, in order that their race might not fail, to form con­ <lb/>
            nexions with the men of the adjacent nations. If any male <lb/>
            children were born, they put them to death. The girls they <lb/>
            bred up to the same mode of life with themselves, not con­ <lb/>
            signing them to idleness, or working in wool, but training <lb/>
            them to arms, the management of horses, and hunting; <lb/>
            burning their right breasts in infancy, that their use of the <lb/>
            bow might not be obstructed by them; and hence they were <lb/>
            called Amazons.* They had two queens, Marpesia and Lani­ <lb/>
            pedo, who, dividing their forces into two bodies (after they <lb/>
            were grown famous for their power), conducted their wars, and <lb/>
            defended their borders separately and by turns. And that a <lb/>
            reason for their success might not be wanting, they spread a <lb/>
            report that they were the daughters of Mars.</p>
          <p>After subduing the greater part of Europe, they possessed <lb/>
            themselves also of some cities in Asia.t Having then founded <lb/>
            Ephesus and several other towns there, they sent a detach­ <lb/>
            ment of their army home, laden with a vast quantity of spoil. <lb/>
            The rest, who remained to secure their power in Asia, were <lb/>
            cut to pieces, together with their queen Marpesia, by a com­ <lb/>
            bination of the barbarous tribes. Orithya, the daughter of <lb/>
            Marpesia, succeeded to the government in her room, and has <lb/>
            attracted extraordinary admiration, not only for her eminent <lb/>
            skill in war, but for having preserved her virginity to the end <lb/>
            of her life. So much was added by her valour and conduct to <lb/>
            the fame and glory of the Amazons, that the king, for whom <lb/>
            Hercules was bound to perform twelve labours, ordered him, <lb/>
            as if it were a thing impossible, to bring him the arms of the <lb/>
            queen of the Amazons. Hercules, accordingly, having pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded thither with nine ships of war, the principal young <lb/>
            men of Greece accompanying him, attacked the Amazons <lb/>
            unawares. Two sisters at this time held the government, <lb/>
            Antiope and Orithya; but Orithya was engaged in a wax <note type="footnote"> From &amp; privative, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">μαζός</foreign>. <lb/>
            Asia Minor. </note> <pb n="22"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.II. CH.IV. </note> <lb/>
            abroad. When Hercules, therefore, landed on the coast of <lb/>
            the Amazons, there was but a small number of them there <lb/>
            with their queen Antiope, free from all apprehension of hos­ <lb/>
            tilities. Hence it happened that a few only, roused by the <lb/>
            sudden alarm, took up arms, and these afforded an easy con­ <lb/>
            quest to the enemy. Many were slain, and many taken <lb/>
            prisoners; among the latter were two sisters of Antiope. <lb/>
            Menalippe being taken by Hercules, and Hippolyte by The­ <lb/>
            seus. Theseus, having received his prisoner as his share of <lb/>
            the spoil, took her to wife, and had by her his son Hippolytus. <lb/>
            Hercules, after his victory, restored his captive Menalippe to <lb/>
            her sister, receiving the arms of the queen as a recompence ; <lb/>
            and having thus executed what was imposed on him, he returned <lb/>
            to the king.</p>
          <p>But Orithya, when she found that war had been made upon <lb/>
            her sister, and that the assailant was a chief of the Athenians, <lb/>
            exhorted her followers to revenge the affront, saying that the <lb/>
            “ coast of the Pontus, and Asia, had been conquered in vain, <lb/>
            if they were still exposed, not merely to the wars, but to the <lb/>
            marauding invasions, of the Greeks." She then solicited aid <lb/>
            from Sagillus, king of Scythia; representing to him “ their <lb/>
            Scythian descent, the loss of their husbands, their obligation to <lb/>
            take arms, and their reasons for making war;" adding, “ that <lb/>
            they had proved by their valour, that the Scythians must be <lb/>
            thought to have women not less spirited than their men." <lb/>
            Sagillus, alive to the glory of his nation, sent his son Panasa* <lb/>
            goras, with a numerous body of cavalry, to their aid. But <lb/>
            some disagreement having occurred before the battle, they <lb/>
            were deserted by their auxiliaries, and worsted in the conflict <lb/>
            by the Athenians. They had, however, the camp of their <lb/>
            allies as a place of refuge, under whose protection they <lb/>
            returned to their kingdom unmolested by other nations.</p>
          <p>After Orithya, Penthesilea occupied the throne, of whose <lb/>
            valour there were seen great proofs among the bravest heroes <lb/>
            in the Trojan war, when she led an auxiliary force thither <lb/>
            against the Greeks. But Penthesilea being at last killed, and <lb/>
            her army destroyed, a few only of the Amazons, who had <lb/>
            remained at home in their own country, established a power <lb/>
            that continued (defending itself with difficulty against its <lb/>
            neighbours), to the time of Alexander the Great. Their <lb/>
            queen Minithya, or Thalestris, after obtaining from Alexander <pb n="23"/>

            the enjoyment of his society for thirteen days, in order to <lb/>
            have issue by him, returned into her kingdom, and soon after <lb/>
            died, together with the whole name of the Amazons.</p>
          <p>V. The Scythians, in their Asiatic expedition, having been <lb/>
            absent from their wives and children eight years, were met on <lb/>
            their return home by a war raised by their slaves. For their <lb/>
            wives, weary of waiting so long for their husbands, and think­ <lb/>
            ing that they were not detained by war, but had perished in <lb/>
            the field, married their slaves that had been left at home <lb/>
            to take care of the cattle ; who, taking up arms, repelled their <lb/>
            masters, returning with victory, from the borders of their <lb/>
            country, as if they had been strangers. Success against them <lb/>
            being uncertain, the Scythians were advised to change their <lb/>
            method of attack, remembering that they were not to fight <lb/>
            with soldiers, but with slaves, who were to be conquered, <lb/>
            not by means of arms, but of magisterial authority; that <lb/>
            whips, not weapons, were to be used in the field ; and that, <lb/>
            swords being laid aside, rods and scourges, and other instru­ <lb/>
            ments of terror to slaves, were to be provided. This sugges­ <lb/>
            tion being approved, and all being equipped as was prescribed, <lb/>
            the Scythians, as soon as they drew near the enemy, held <lb/>
            out scourges towards them unexpectedly, and struck them <lb/>
            such terror, that they conquered with the dread of stripes <lb/>
            those whom they could not conquer with the sword, and who <lb/>
            took to flight, not as defeated enemies, but as fugitive <lb/>
            slaves. As many as could be taken, paid the penalty for their <lb/>
            rebellion on the cross. The women too, conscious of their <lb/>
            ill conduct, put an end to their lives partly by the sword and <lb/>
            partly by hanging.</p>
          <p>After this occurrence, there was peace among the Scythians <lb/>
            till the time of king Jancyrus, on whom Darius, king of <lb/>
            Persia, as was said above, made war, because he could not <lb/>
            obtain his daughter in marriage. Darius, having entered <lb/>
            Scythia with seven hundred thousand armed men, and the <lb/>
            enemy allowing him no opportunity of fighting, dreading lest, <lb/>
            if the bridge over the Ister were broken down, his retreat <lb/>
            should be cut off, hurried back in alarm, with the loss of <lb/>
            eighty thousand men; which loss, however, out of so vast a <lb/>
            number, was scarcely accounted a disaster. Darius afterwards <lb/>
            subdued Asia and Macedonia, and defeated the lonians in a <lb/>
            fight at sea. Then, learning that the Athenians had given <pb n="24"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.II. CH.VI </note> <lb/>
            aid to the lonians against him, he turned all his warlike fury <lb/>
            upon them.</p>
          <p>VI. Since we have now come to the wars of the Athenians, <lb/>
            which were carried on, not only beyond expectation as to what <lb/>
            could be done, but even beyond belief as to what was done, <lb/>
            the efforts of that people having been successful beyond their <lb/>
            hopes, the origin of their city must be briefly set forth; for <lb/>
            they did not, like other nations, rise to eminence from a mean <lb/>
            commencement, but are the only people that can boast, <lb/>
            not only of their rise, but also of their birth. It was <lb/>
            not a concourse of foreigners, or a rabble of people collected <lb/>
            from different parts, that raised their city, but men who <lb/>
            were born on the same ground which they inhabit; and the <lb/>
            country which is their place of abode, was also their birth- <lb/>
            place. It was they who first taught. the art of working <lb/>
            in wool, and the use of oil and wine. They also showed men, <lb/>
            who had previously fed on acorns, how to plough and sow. <lb/>
            Literature and eloquence, it is certain, and the state of civil <lb/>
            discipline which we enjoy, had Athens as their temple. <lb/>
            Before Deucalion's time, they had a king named Cecrops, <lb/>
            whom, as all antiquity is full of fables, they represented tc <lb/>
            have been of both sexes, because he was the first to join male <lb/>
            and female in marriage. To him succeeded Cranaus, whose <lb/>
            daughter Atthis gave name to the country. After him <lb/>
            reigned Amphictyon, who first consecrated the city to Minerva, <lb/>
            and gave it the name of Athens. In his days, a deluge <lb/>
            swept away the greater part of the inhabitants of Greece. <lb/>
            Those only escaped, whom a refuge on the mountains pro­ <lb/>
            tected, or who went off in ships to Deucalion, king of Thessaly, <lb/>
            by whom, from this circumstance, the human race is said to <lb/>
            have been restored. The crown then descended, in the <lb/>
            course of succession, to Erectheus, in whose reign the sowing <lb/>
            of corn was commenced by Triptolemus at Eleusis; in <lb/>
            commemoration of which benefit the nights sacred to the <lb/>
            mysteries of Ceres were appointed. Ægeus also, the father of <lb/>
            Theseus, was king of Athens, from whom Medea divorcing <lb/>
            herself, on account of the adult age of her step-son, returned <lb/>
            to Colchis with her son Medus, whom she had had by Egeus. <lb/>
            After Ægeus reigned Theseus. and after Theseus his son <note type="footnote"> * See, on the praise of Athens, Lucret. vi. 1 ; Ælian. Var. Hist. iii. <lb/>

            Demophoon, who afforded aid to the Greeks against the Tro­ <lb/>
            jans. Between the Athenians and Dorians there had been <lb/>
            animosities of long standing, which the Dorians, intending to <lb/>
            revenge in war, consulted the oracle about the event of <lb/>
            the contest. The answer was, that the “ Dorians would <lb/>
            have the advantage, if they did not kill the king of the <lb/>
            Athenians." When they came into the field, the Done <lb/>
            soldiers were charged above all things to take care not to <lb/>
            attack the king. At that time the king of the Athenians was <lb/>
            Codrus, who, learning the answer of the god and the direc­ <lb/>
            tions of the enemy, laid aside his royal dress, and entered the <lb/>
            camp of the enemy in rags, with a bundle of sticks on his <lb/>
            back. Here, among a crowd of people that stood in his way, <lb/>
            he was killed by a soldier whom he had purposely wounded <lb/>
            with a pruning knife. His body being recognized as that of <lb/>
            the king, the Dorians went off without coming to battle ; <lb/>
            and thus the Athenians, through the bravery of a prince who <lb/>
            submitted to death for the safety of his country, were relieved <lb/>
            from war.</p>
          <p>VII. After Codrus there was no king at Athens; a cir <lb/>
            umstance which is attributed to the respect paid to his <lb/>
            memory. The government of the state was placed in the <lb/>
            hands of magistrates elected annually. At this period the <lb/>
            people had no laws, for the wills of their princes had always <lb/>
            been received instead of laws. Solon, a man of eminent <lb/>
            integrity, was in consequence chosen to found the state, as it <lb/>
            were afresh, by the establishment of laws. This man acted <lb/>
            with such judicious moderation between the commons and the <lb/>
            senate (though whatever he proposed in favour of one <lb/>
            class, seemed likely to displease the other), that he received <lb/>
            equal thanks from both parties. Among many illustrious acts <lb/>
            of Solon, the following is eminently worthy of record. A war <lb/>
            had been carried on between the Athenians and Megarians, <lb/>
            concerning their respective claims to the island of Salamis, <lb/>
            almost to the utter destruction of both. After many defeats, <lb/>
            it was made a capital offence at Athens to propose a law for <lb/>
            the recovery of the island. Solon, anxious lest he should <lb/>
            injure his country by keeping silence, or himself by expressing <lb/>
            his opinion, pretended to be suddenly seized with madness, <lb/>
            under cover of which he might not only say, but do, what was <lb/>
            prohibited. In a strange garb, like an insane person, he rushed <pb n="26"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.II. CH.VIII. </note> <lb/>
            forth into the public streets, where, having collected a crowd <lb/>
            about him, he began, that he might the better conceal his <lb/>
            design, to urge the people in verse (which he was unaccus. <lb/>
            tomed to make), to do what was forbidden, and produced such <lb/>
            an effect on the minds of all, that war was instantly decreed <lb/>
            against the Megarians; and the enemy being defeated, the <lb/>
            island became subject to the Athenians.</p>
          <p>VIII. After a time, the Megarians, cherishing the remem <lb/>
            brance of the war made upon them by the Athenians, and <lb/>
            fearing that they might be said to have taken up arms to no <lb/>
            purpose, went on board a fleet with a design to seize the <lb/>
            Athenian matrons as they were celebrating the Eleusinian <lb/>
            mysteries during the night. Their intention becoming known, <lb/>
            Pisistratus, the Athenian general, placed a body of young <lb/>
            men in ambush to receive them, directing the matrons, at the <lb/>
            same time, to continue the celebration of the sacred rites with <lb/>
            their usual cries and noise, even while the enemy were ap­ <lb/>
            proaching, in order that they might not know that their coming <lb/>
            was expected; and thus attacking the Megarians unawares, <lb/>
            just as they were leaving their ahips, he put them all to the <lb/>
            sword. Immediately after, having taken some women with <lb/>
            his men on board the fleet which he had seized, to appear <lb/>
            like captured matrons of the Athenians, he set sail for Megara. <lb/>
            The Megarians, seeing ships of their own build approaching, <lb/>
            apparently with the desired prey on board, went out to the <lb/>
            harbour to meet them. Pisistratus cut them to pieces, and <lb/>
            almost succeeded in taking their city. Thus the Megarians, <lb/>
            having their own stratagem turned against them, afforded their <lb/>
            enemies a triumph.</p>
          <p>But Pisistratus, as if he had conquered for himself and not <lb/>
            for his country, possessed himself of the sovereign authority <lb/>
            by a subtle contrivance. Having undergone a voluntary <lb/>
            scourging in his own house, he ran out, with his body lace­ <lb/>
            rated, into the open street, and, having summoned an as­ <lb/>
            sembly of the people, showed them his wounds, complaining of <lb/>
            the cruelty of the great men of the city, from whom he <lb/>
            pretended to have received this treatment. Tears were joined <lb/>
            to his words, and the credulous mob was easily inflamed be <lb/>
            a calumnious speech, in which he affirmed that he had <lb/>
            incurred the hatred of the senate by showing his love for the <lb/>
            common people. He thus obtained a guard for the protection <pb n="27"/>
            <note type="margin"> B.C. 489.] </note> <lb/>
            of his person, by the aid of which he got the sovereign power <lb/>
            into his hands, and reigned thirty-three years.</p>
          <p>IX. After his death Diocles,* one of his sons, having <lb/>
            offered violence to a maiden, was slain by her brother. His <lb/>
            other son, whose name was Hippias, taking upon him the <lb/>
            authority of his father, ordered the murderer of his brother <lb/>
            to be apprehended; who, being forced by torture to name <lb/>
            those that were privy to the murder, named all the intimate <lb/>
            friends of the tyrant. These being put to death, and Hippias <lb/>
            asking him “ whether any of the guilty still survived," he <lb/>
            replied, that “there was no one surviving whom he should <lb/>
            more rejoice to see die than the tyrant himself." By which <lb/>
            answer he proved himself superior to the tyrant, after having <lb/>
            avenged, too, the violated honour of his sister.</p>
          <p>The city being animated, through his spirited conduct, with <lb/>
            a desire for liberty, Hippias was at last deprived of his power, <lb/>
            and driven into exile. Setting out for Persia, he offered him­ <lb/>
            self as a leader to Darius against his own country; Darius <lb/>
            being then, as has been said before, ready to make war on <lb/>
            the Athenians. The Athenians, hearing of Darius's approach, <lb/>
            requested assistance from the Lacedæmonians, who were then <lb/>
            in alliance with them. But finding that they delayed at home <lb/>
            four days, in consequence of some religious scruple, they did <lb/>
            not wait for their help, but, having mustered ten thousand of <lb/>
            their own citizens, and a thousand auxiliaries from Platææ, <lb/>
            went out to battle in the plain of Marathon, against six <lb/>
            hundred thousand of the enemy. Miltiades was both their <lb/>
            general in the field, and the person who advised them not to <lb/>
            wait for assistance, being possessed with such confidence of <lb/>
            success, that he thought there was more trust to be placed in <lb/>
            expedition than in their allies. Great, therefore, was their <lb/>
            spirit as they proceeded to battle; so that, though there were a <lb/>
            thousand paces between the two armies, they came full speed <lb/>
            upon the enemy before their arrows were discharged. Nor <lb/>
            did the result fall short of their daring; for such was the <lb/>
            courage with which they fought, that you might have supposed <lb/>
            there were men on one side and a herd of cattle on the other. <lb/>
            The Persians, utterly defeated, fled to their ships, of which <lb/>
            many were sunk and many taken. In this battle, the bravery <lb/>
            of every individual was such, that it was difficult to determine <note type="footnote"> * All other historians call him Hipparchus. See Thucyd L 20. </note> <pb n="28"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.II. CH.X. </note> <lb/>
            to whom the highest praise was due. Amongst others, how­ <lb/>
            ever, the heroism of Themistocles, tnen a young man, was <lb/>
            greatly distinguished; in whom, even then, appeared a genius <lb/>
            indicative of his future eminence as a general. The merit of <lb/>
            Cynægirus, too, an Athenian soldier, has met with great com­ <lb/>
            mendation from historians; for, after having slain a great <lb/>
            number in the battle, and having chased the fleeing enemy to <lb/>
            their ships, he seized a crowded vessel with his right band, <lb/>
            and would not let it go till he had lost his hand; and even <lb/>
            then, when his right hand was cut off, he took hold of the <lb/>
            ship with his left, and having lost this hand also, he at last <lb/>
            seized the ship with his teeth. So undaunted was his spirit, <lb/>
            that neither being weary with killing so many, nor dis­ <lb/>
            heartened with the loss of his hands, he fought to the last. <lb/>
            maimed as he was, with his teeth, like a wild beast. The <lb/>
            Persians lost two thousand men in the battle or by shipwreck.- <lb/>
            Hippias also, the Athenian tyrant, who was the promoter and <lb/>
            encourager of the war, was killed on the occasion; the gods, <lb/>
            the avengers of his country, inflicting on him the penalty of <lb/>
            his perfidy.</p>
          <p>X. Some time after, Darius, when he was going to renew <lb/>
            the war, died in the midst of his preparations for it, leaving <lb/>
            behind him several sons, some born before his accession to <lb/>
            the crown, and others after it. Artemenes, the eldest of them, <lb/>
            claimed the kingdom by the law of primogeniture, a law which <lb/>
            he said that both order of birth and nature herself had pre­ <lb/>
            scribed to all nations. Xerxes, however, alleged, that the <lb/>
            dispute was not so much about the order as the good fortune <lb/>
            of their birth; for that " Artemenes was born first indeed to <lb/>
            Darius, but while he was in a private station; that he himself <lb/>
            was born to him first after he was king; and that, conse­ <lb/>
            quently, such of his brothers as were born before him might <lb/>
            claim the private estate which Darius then possessed, but <lb/>
            could have no claim to the kingdom ; he himself being the <lb/>
            first-born whom his father, when king, had bred up to succeed <lb/>
            him on the throne.. In addition to this," he said, " Arte­ <lb/>
            menes was sprung, not only from a father but from a mother <lb/>
            in a private condition, and from a maternal grandfather of <lb/>
            similar station; but he himself was both sprung from a <note type="footnote"> * In regnum.] Wetzel, with most editors, has in regno. but in regnum <lb/>

            mother who was a queen, and had never known his father <lb/>
            except as a king; he had also for his maternal grandfather <lb/>
            king Cyrus, not the heir, but the founder of so great an em­ <lb/>
            pire ; and even if their father had left both brothers with equal <lb/>
            claims, yet he himself ought to have the advantage in right of <lb/>
            his mother and grandfather." The settlement of the contro­ <lb/>
            versy they left, with mutual consent, to their uncle Arts. <lb/>
            phernes, as the fittest judge of their family differences; who, <lb/>
            having heard their pleas in his own house, decided in favour <lb/>
            of Xerxes. But the contest was conducted in so brotherly a <lb/>
            way, that neither did he who gained the cause show any <lb/>
            unseemly triumph, nor did he who lost it express dissatisfac­ <lb/>
            tion ; and, during the very time of the contention, they sent <lb/>
            presents to one another, and gave such entertainments, as <lb/>
            showed not only mutual confidence, but pleasure in each <lb/>
            other's society. The judgment, too, was pronounced without <lb/>
            witnesses, and heard without a murmur. So much more con­ <lb/>
            tentedly did brothers then share the greatest kingdoms, than <lb/>
            they now divide the smallest estates I</p>
          <p>Xerxes then proceeded, during five years, with his prepa­ <lb/>
            rations for the war against Greece, which his father had <lb/>
            commenced. As soon as Demaratus, king of the Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nians, who was then an exile at the court of Xerxes, under­ <lb/>
            stood his intentions, he, feeling more regard for his country, <lb/>
            notwithstanding his banishment, than for the king in return <lb/>
            for his favours, sent full intelligence of the matter to the <lb/>
            magistrates of the Lacedæmonians, that they might not be <lb/>
            surprised by an unexpected attack; writing the account on <lb/>
            wooden tablets, and hiding the writing with wax spread over <lb/>
            it; taking care, however, not merely that writing without <lb/>
            a cover might not give proof against him, but that too fresh <lb/>
            wax might not betray the contrivance. These tablets he <lb/>
            committed to a trusty slave, who was ordered to deliver them <lb/>
            into the hands of the authorities at Sparta. When they were <lb/>
            received, the object of them was long a matter of inquiry, <lb/>
            because the magistrates could see nothing written on them, and <lb/>
            yet could not imagine that they were sent to no purpose ; and <lb/>
            they thought the matter must be momentous in proportion to, its <lb/>
            mysteriousness. While the men were still engaged in conjec­ <lb/>
            ture, the sister of king Leonidas surmised the v riter's intention <lb/>
            The wax being accordingly scraped off the account of the <pb n="30"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.II. CH.XI. </note> <lb/>
            warlike preparations appeared. Xerxes had already armed <lb/>
            seven hundred thousand men of his own kingdom, and three <lb/>
            hundred thousand of his auxiliaries; so that there was some <lb/>
            ground for the assertion that rivers were drunk up by his <lb/>
            army, and that all Greece could scarcely contain it. He is <lb/>
            also said to have had a fleet of twelve hundred ships. But <lb/>
            for this vast army a general was wanting; for if you contem­ <lb/>
            plate its king, you could not commend his capacity as a leader, <lb/>
            however you might extol his wealth, of which there was such <lb/>
            abundance in his realm, that, while rivers were drained by his <lb/>
            forces, his treasury was still unexhausted. He was always seen <lb/>
            foremost in flight, and hindmost in battle ; he was a coward <lb/>
            in danger, and when danger was away, a boaster ; and, in flue, <lb/>
            before he made trial of war, elated with confidence in his <lb/>
            strength (as if he had been lord of nature itself), he levelled <lb/>
            mountains, filled up valleys, covered some seas with bridges, <lb/>
            and contracted others, for the convenience of navigation, into <lb/>
            shorter channels.</p>
          <p>XI. In proportion to the terror of his entrance into <lb/>
            Greece, was the shame and dishonour of his retreat from it. <lb/>
            Leonidas, king of the Spartans, having occupied the straits <lb/>
            of Thermopylae with four thousand men, Xerxes, in contempt <lb/>
            of so small a number, ordered such of the Persians as had lost <lb/>
            relatives in the battle of Marathon, to commence an attack <lb/>
            upon them; who, while they endeavoured to avenge their <lb/>
            friends, were the first to be slaughtered, and a useless multi­ <lb/>
            tude taking their place, the havoc became still greater. For <lb/>
            three days was the struggle maintained, to the grief and <lb/>
            indignation of the Persians. On the fourth, it being told <lb/>
            Leonidas that the summit of the mountain was occupied by <lb/>
            twenty thousand of the enemy, he exhorted the allies " to <lb/>
            retire, and reserve themselves to their country for better <lb/>
            times;" saying, that " he himself would try his fortune with <lb/>
            the Spartans ; that he ought to care more for his country than <lb/>
            for his life, and that others should be preserved for the <lb/>
            defence of Greece." On hearing the king's resolution, the <lb/>
            rest retired, the Lacedæmonians alone remaining.</p>
          <p>At the beginning of the war, when the Spartans consulted <lb/>
            the oracle at Delphi, they had received the answer, that <lb/>
            " either the king or their city must fall." King Leonidas, <lb/>
            accordingly, when he proceeded to battle, had so fixed the <pb n="31"/>
            <note type="margin"> B.C. 479.] </note> <lb/>
            resolution of his men, that they felt they must go to the field <lb/>
            with minds prepared for death. He had posted himself in a <lb/>
            narrow pass, too, that he might either conquer more gloriously <lb/>
            with a few, or fall with less damage to his country, Thq <lb/>
            allies being therefore sent away, he exhorted his Spartans " to <lb/>
            remember that, however they struggled, they must expect to <lb/>
            perish ; to take care not to show more resolution to stay than <lb/>
            to fight;" adding that, " they must not wait till they were <lb/>
            surrounded by the enemy, but when night afforded them <lb/>
            opportunity, must surprise them in security and at their ease; <lb/>
            as conquerors could die nowhere more honourably than in the <lb/>
            camp of the foe." There was no difficulty in stimulating men <lb/>
            determined to die. They immediately seized their arms, and <lb/>
            six hundred men rushed into the camp of five hundred thou­ <lb/>
            sand, making directly for the king's tent, and resolving either <lb/>
            to die with him, or, if they should be overpowered, at least in <lb/>
            his quarters. An alarm spread through the whole Persian <lb/>
            army. The Spartans being unable to find the king, marched <lb/>
            uncontrolled through the whole camp, killing and overthrow­ <lb/>
            ing all that stood in their way, like men who knew that they <lb/>
            fought, not with the hope of victory, but to avenge their own <lb/>
            deaths. The contest was protracted from the beginning of <lb/>
            the night through the greater part of the following day. At <lb/>
            last, not conquered, but exhausted with conquering, they fell <lb/>
            amidst vast heaps of slaughtered enemies. Xerxes, having <lb/>
            thus met with two defeats by land, resolved next to try his <lb/>
            fortune by sea.</p>
          <p>XII. Themistocles, the general of the Athenians, having <lb/>
            discovered that the Ionians, on whose account they had under­ <lb/>
            taken this war with the Persians, were come to the assistance <lb/>
            of the king with a fleet, resolved to draw them over to his <lb/>
            own side. Being unable to find arty opportunity of speaking <lb/>
            with them, he caused placards to be fixed, and inscriptions to <lb/>
            be written, on the rocks where they were to land, to the follow­ <lb/>
            ing effect; " What madness possesses you, 0 Ionians ? What <lb/>
            evil are you going to do ? Do you intend to make war on <lb/>
            those who were formerly your founders, and lately your <lb/>
            avengers? Did we build your cities that a people might <lb/>
            arise from them to destroy ours? Was it not Darius's <lb/>
            reason * for attacking us before, and is it not now that of <note type="footnote"> * Quid ? si non hæc et Dario prius, et nunc Xeraes, belli causa </note> <pb n="32"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.II. CH.XII. </note> <lb/>
            Xerxes, that we did not desert you when you rebelled against <lb/>
            them? But pass over from your place of confinement* <lb/>
            to our camp; or, if this course is unsafe, withdraw when <lb/>
            the battle begins; keep back your vessels with your oars, <lb/>
            and retire from the engagement." Before this encounter at <lb/>
            sea, Xerxes had sent four thousand armed men to plunder the <lb/>
            temple of Apollo, as if he had been at war, not with the <lb/>
            Greeks only, but with the immortal gods ; but the whole of <lb/>
            this detachment was destroyed by a storm of rain and thunder, <lb/>
            that he might be convinced how feeble human strength is <lb/>
            against the powers of heaven. Afterwards he burnt Thespiae, <lb/>
            Platææ, and Athens, all abandoned by their inhabitants; vent­ <lb/>
            ing his rage on the buildings by fire, since he could not <lb/>
            destroy the people by the sword. For the Athenians, after <lb/>
            the battle of Marathon, because Themistocles forewarned <lb/>
            them that their victory would not be the termination of the <lb/>
            war, but the cause of a greater one, had built two hundred <lb/>
            ships; and when, at the approach of Xerxes, he consulted <lb/>
            the oracle at Delphi, they were answered, that “they must <lb/>
            provide for their safety with wooden walls." Themistocles, <lb/>
            thinking that defence with shipping was meant, persuaded <lb/>
            them all, that the citizens, not the walls, constituted their <lb/>
            country; that a city consisted, not of its buildings, but of its <lb/>
            inhabitants; that it would be better for them, therefore, to <lb/>
            trust their safety to their ships than to their city; and that <lb/>
            the god was the adviser of this course.” The counsel being <lb/>
            approved, they committed their wives and children, with their <lb/>
            most valuable property, to certain islands out of the way ;† <lb/>
            while the men went in arms on board the ships. Other cities <lb/>
            also followed the example of the Athenians. But when the whole <lb/>
            fleet of the allies was assembled, ready for an engagement, <note type="footnote"> nobiscum foret, &amp;c.] I have not attempted to translate the commence­ <lb/>

            and had posted itself in the narrow strait of Saianis, that it <lb/>
            might not be overwhelmed by superior numbers, a dissension <lb/>
            arose among the leading men of the different cities, who were <lb/>
            disposed to relinquish the plan of a general war, and go off <lb/>
            each to defend his own country. Themistocles, fearing that <lb/>
            the strength of his countrymen would be too much weakened <lb/>
            by such desertion of their allies, sent intimation to Xerxes <lb/>
            by a trusty slave, that “he might now easily make himself <lb/>
            master of all Greece, when it was collected in one place; <lb/>
            but that if the several states which were inclined to go <lb/>
            away should once be dispersed, he would have to pursue <lb/>
            each of them singly with far greater trouble." By this <lb/>
            stratagem he induced the king to give the signal for battle. <lb/>
            The Greeks, at the same time, taken by surprise by the <lb/>
            enemy is attack, proceeded to oppose them with their united <lb/>
            force. The king, meantime, remained on shore as a spectator <lb/>
            of the combat, with part of the ships near him; while Arte­ <lb/>
            misia, queen of Halicarnassus, who had come to the assistance <lb/>
            of Xerxes, was fighting with the greatest gallantry among the <lb/>
            foremost leaders; so that you might have seen womanish <lb/>
            fear in a man,* and manly boldness in a woman. While the <lb/>
            result of the battle was still doubtful, the Ionians, according <lb/>
            to the admonition of Themistocles, began gradually to with­ <lb/>
            draw from the contest; and their desertion broke the courage <lb/>
            of the rest. The Persians, as they were considering in which <lb/>
            direction they might flee, suffered a repulse, and were soon <lb/>
            after utterly defeated, and put to flight. In the confusion, <lb/>
            many ships were taken, and many sunk; but the greater <lb/>
            number, fearing the king's cruelty not less than the enemy, <lb/>
            went off to their respective homes.</p>
          <p>XIII. While Xerxes was confounded at his disaster, and <lb/>
            doubtful what course to pursue, Mardonius addressed him, <lb/>
            advising him " to return home to his kingdom, lest fame, <lb/>
            carrying the news of his defeat, and exaggerating every thing <lb/>
            according to her custom, should occasion any sedition in his <lb/>
            absence; and to leave with him three hundred thousand men-at­ <lb/>
            arms, chosen from the whole army, with which force he would <lb/>
            either subdue Greece to the king's glory, or, if the result should <lb/>
            prove unfavourable, would retire before the enemy without <lb/>
            dishonour to him.” Mardonius's suggestion being approved <note type="footnote"> * Xerxes himself. </note> <note type="footnote"> D </note> <pb n="34"/>
             <note type="margin">[B.II. CH.XIV. </note> <lb/>
            the force which he requested was given him, and the king <lb/>
            prepared to return home with the rest of the army. The <lb/>
            Greeks, hearing of his flight, formed a design to break down <lb/>
            the bridge, which, as conqueror of the sea, he had made at <lb/>
            Abydos; so that, his retreat being cut off, he might either be <lb/>
            destroyed with his army, or might be forced, by the desperate <lb/>
            state of his affairs, to sue for peace. But Themistocles, <lb/>
            fearing that the enemy, if they were stopped, might take <lb/>
            courage from despair, and open by their swords a passage not <lb/>
            to be opened by other means, and observing that " there were <lb/>
            enemies enough left in Greece, and that the number ought not <lb/>
            to be increased by preventing their escape," but finding that <lb/>
            he was unable to move his countrymen by his admonitions, <lb/>
            despatched the same slave as before to Xerxes, acquainting him <lb/>
            of the intention of the Greeks to break down the bridge, and <lb/>
            urging him to secure a passage by a speedy flight. Xerxes. <lb/>
            alarmed at the message, left his army to be conducted by his <lb/>
            generals, and hurried away himself, with a few attendants, to <lb/>
            Abydos; where, having found the bridge broken down by the <lb/>
            winter storms, he crossed in the utmost trepidation in a <lb/>
            fishing-boat. It was a sight worth contemplation for judging <lb/>
            of the condition of man,* so wonderful for its vicissitudes, to <lb/>
            see him shrinking down in a little boat, whom shortly before <lb/>
            the whole ocean could scarcely contain; to behold him wanting <lb/>
            servants to attend him, whose armies had burdened the earth <lb/>
            with their numbers ! Nor had the land-forces, which he had <lb/>
            committed to his generals, a more fortunate retreat; for to <lb/>
            their daily fatigue (and there is no rest to men in fear) was <lb/>
            added the want of provisions. A famine of several days <lb/>
            produced also a pestilential distemper; and so dire was the <lb/>
            mortality, that the roads were filled with dead bodies; and <lb/>
            birds and beasts of prey, allured by the attraction of food, <lb/>
            followed close upon the army.</p>
          <p>XIV. In Greece, in the meantime, Mardonius took <lb/>
            Olynthus by storm. He also invited the Athenians to listen <note type="footnote"> * Erat res spectaculo digna, et æstimatione sortis humance, rerum varie­ <lb/>

            deserving of attentive contemplation, and one from which you might <lb/>
            judge of the lot of man; of the wonderful changeableness of which <lb/>
            Xerxes was an example." </note> <pb n="35"/>
            <note type="margin"> B.C. 478.] </note> <lb/>
            to offers of peace, and of the king's friendship; promising to <lb/>
            rebuild their city, which had been burnt, in greater splendour <lb/>
            than before. But when he saw that they would not sell their <lb/>
            liberty at any rate, he set fire to what they had begun to <lb/>
            rebuild, and led off his army into Bœotia. Thither the army <lb/>
            of the Greeks, which consisted of a hundred thousand men, <lb/>
            followed him, and there a battle was fought. But the fortune <lb/>
            of the king was not changed with the general; for Mardonius, <lb/>
            being defeated, escaped, as it were from a shipwreck, with but <lb/>
            a small number of followers. His camp, which was filled with <lb/>
            the king's treasures, was taken; and hence it was, on the <lb/>
            division of the Persian gold among them, that the charms of <lb/>
            wealth first attracted the Greeks. By chance, on the same day <lb/>
            on which the army of Mardonius was defeated, an engagement <lb/>
            was fought by sea near the mountain Mycale, on the coast of <lb/>
            Asia. Before the encounter began, and whilst the fleets stood <lb/>
            opposite one another, a rumour spread through both parties, <lb/>
            that the Greeks had gained a victory, and that the army of <lb/>
            Mardonius was utterly destroyed. It is said that so great was <lb/>
            the speed of this report, that when the battle was fought in <lb/>
            Bœotia in the morning, the news of the victory arrived in Asia <lb/>
            by noon, passing over so much sea, and so large a space of <lb/>
            ground, in so very short a time. When the war was over, and <lb/>
            they proceeded to consider the respective merits of the cities <lb/>
            that had been engaged <unclear>in</unclear> <unclear>it</unclear>, the bravery of the Athenians was <lb/>
            praised above that of any other people. Among the leaders too, <lb/>
            Themistocles, being pronounced the most meritorious by the <lb/>
            judgment of the several states, added greatly to the glory of his <lb/>
            country.</p>
          <p>XV. The Athenians, then, being enriched by the spoils of <lb/>
            war, as well as in glory, applied themselves to rebuild their city. <lb/>
            Having enlarged the compass of their walls, they became an <lb/>
            object of suspicion to the Lacedæmonians, naturally reflecting <lb/>
            how great power a city, when fortified, might secure to a people <lb/>
            for whom it had done so much when in a state of ruin. They <lb/>
            therefore sent ambassadors to admonish them that " they <lb/>
            should not build what might prove a stronghold for the enemy, <lb/>
            and a place of shelter for them in a future war." Themistocles, <lb/>
            seeing that envy was entertained towards the rising hopes of <lb/>
            his city, but not thinking it prudent to deal abruptly with ihe <lb/>
            Spartans, made answer to the ambassadors, that " deputies <note type="footnote"> D 2 </note> <pb n="36"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.II. CH.XV. </note> <lb/>
            should be sent to Lacedæmon to confer with them about the <lb/>
            matter." After thus dismissing the messengers, he exhorted <lb/>
            his countrymen “to expedite the work." Allowing some time <lb/>
            to elapse, he set out, with some others, as an embassy to <lb/>
            Sparta; but sometimes pretending ill health on the road, some­ <lb/>
            times complaining of the tardiness of his colleagues, without <lb/>
            whom nothing could be properly done, and thus putting off <lb/>
            from day to day, he endeavoured to gain time for his country­ <lb/>
            men to finish the erection of their walls. In the meanwhile, <lb/>
            word was brought to the Spartans that the work was advancing <lb/>
            at Athens with great speed; and they accordingly sent <lb/>
            ambassadors a second time to ascertain the truth. Themis­ <lb/>
            tocles then sent a letter by the hand of a slave, to the magis­ <lb/>
            trates of the Athenians, desiring them " to take the ambas­ <lb/>
            sadors into custody, and keep them as hostages, lest any <lb/>
            violent measures should be adopted against himself at Sparta.” <lb/>
            He then went to the public assembly of the Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            and told them that " Athens was now well fortified, and could <lb/>
            sustain a war, if any should be made upon it, not only with <lb/>
            arms, but with walls; and that their ambassadors were <lb/>
            detained by way of hostages at Athens, in case they should on <lb/>
            that account resolve on anything injurious towards himself." <lb/>
            He then upbraided them severely “for seeking to increase their <lb/>
            power, not by their own valour, but by weakening their allies." <lb/>
            Being then permitted to depart, he was received by his <lb/>
            countrymen as if he had triumphed over Sparta.</p>
          <p>After this occurrence, the Spartans, that they might not <lb/>
            impair their strength in idleness, and that they might take <lb/>
            vengeance for the Wale which had been twice made upon <lb/>
            Greece by the Persians, proceeded to lay waste the Persian <lb/>
            territories. They chose Pausanias to be general of their army, <lb/>
            and that of their allies, who, coveting, instead of the mere <lb/>
            office of general, the entire sovereignty of Greece, treated <lb/>
            with Xerxes for a marriage with his daughter, as a reward for <lb/>
            betraying his country, restoring him, at the same time, his <lb/>
            prisoners, that the good feeling of the king might be secured <lb/>
            by such an obligation. He wrote also to Xerxes, “to put to <lb/>
            death whatever messengers he sent to him, lest the negociation <lb/>
            should be betrayed by their babbling." But Aristides, the <lb/>
            general of the Athenians, and his associate in the command, by <lb/>
            traversing the attempts of his colleague, and taking prudent <pb n="37"/>
            <note type="margin"> B.C. 472.] </note> <lb/>
            precautions on the occasion, defeated his treasonable designs. <lb/>
            Not long after, Pausanias was brought to trial and condemned.</p>
          <p>Xerxes, when he found that this perfidious scheme was dis­ <lb/>
            covered, made fresh preparations for war. The Greeks <lb/>
            nominated as their general Cimon the Athenian, the son o <lb/>
            Miltiades, under whose command the battle of Marathon was <lb/>
            fought; a young man whose future greatness his manifestations <lb/>
            of affection towards his father foretold. For he redeemed the <lb/>
            body of his father (who had been thrown into prison on a <lb/>
            charge of embezzling the public money, and had died there), <lb/>
            taking his fetters on himself,. that it might receive the rites <lb/>
            of sepulture. Nor did he, in his conduct of the war, disappoint <lb/>
            the opinion of those who chose him; for, not falling in merit <lb/>
            below his father, he forced Xerxes, defeated both by land and <lb/>
            sea, to retreat in trepidation to his own dominions.</p>

          <p>I. XERXES, king of Persia, once the terror of the nations around <lb/>
            him, became, after his unsuccessful conduct of the war against <lb/>
            Greece, an object of contempt even to his own subjects. <lb/>
            Artabanus, his chief officer, conceiving hopes of usurping <lb/>
            the throne, as the king's authority was every day declining, <lb/>
            entered one evening into the palace (which from his intimacy <lb/>
            with Xerxes was always open to him), accompanied by his <lb/>
            seven stout sons, and, having put the king to death, proceeded <lb/>
            to remove by stratagem such of the king's sons as opposed <lb/>
            his wishes. Entertaining little apprehension from Artaxerxes, <lb/>
            who was but a boy, he pretended that the king had been slain <lb/>
            by Darius, who was of full age, that he might have possession <lb/>
            of the throne the sooner, and instigated Artaxerxes to revenge <lb/>
            parricide by fratricide. When they came to Darius's house, <note type="footnote"> * Translatis in se vinculis.] Whether this act was altogether volun­ <lb/>
            tary is discussed by J. A. Bos on <unclear>Corn</unclear>. Nep. Cim. c. 1. </note> <pb n="38"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.III. CH.II. </note> <lb/>
            he was found asleep, and killed as if he merely counterfeited <lb/>
            sleep.* But seeing that one of the king's sons was still <lb/>
            uninjured by his villany, and fearing a struggle for the throne <lb/>
            on the part of the nobles, he took into his councils a certain <lb/>
            Bacabasus, who, content that the government should remain <lb/>
            in the present family, disclosed the whole matter to Artaxerxes, <lb/>
            acquainting him “by what means his father had been killed, <lb/>
            and how his brother had been murdered on a false suspicion <lb/>
            of parricide; and, finally, how a plot was laid for himself." <lb/>
            On this information, Artaxerxes, fearing the number of Arta­ <lb/>
            banus's sons, gave orders for the troops to be ready under <lb/>
            arms on the following day, as if he meant to ascertain their <lb/>
            strength, and their respective efficiency for the field. Arta­ <lb/>
            banus, accordingly, presenting himself under arms among the <lb/>
            rest, the king, pretending that his corslet was too short for <lb/>
            him, desired Artabanus to make an exchange with him, and, <lb/>
            while he was disarming himself, and defenceless, ran him <lb/>
            through with his sword, ordering his sons, at the same time, <lb/>
            to be apprehended. Thus this excellent youth at once took <lb/>
            revenge for his father's murder, and saved himself from the <lb/>
            machinations of Artabanus.</p>
          <p>II. During these transactions in Persia, all Greece, under <lb/>
            the leadership of the Lacedæmonians and Athenians, was split <lb/>
            into two parties, and turned their arms from foreign wars as <lb/>
            it were against their own bowels. Of one people were formed <lb/>
            two distinct bodies ; and they who had so recently served in <lb/>
            the same camp, were divided into two hostile armies. On <lb/>
            the one side, the Lacedæmonians drew over to their faction <lb/>
            the cities that had before been common auxiliaries to both. <lb/>
            On the other side, the Athenians, renowned alike for their <lb/>
            antiquity and their exploits, relied on their own strength. <lb/>
            Thus the two most powerful people of Greece, made equal by <lb/>
            the institutions of Solon and the laws of Lycurgus, rushed <lb/>
            into war through envy of each others power.</p>
          <p>When Lycurgus had succeeded t Polydectes his brother, <lb/>
            king of the Lacedæmonians, and might have secured the <note type="footnote"> * Quasi somnum fingeret.] As if, being guilty, he had counterfeited <lb/>

            successor to his brother, had he not preferred tc give the throne to his <lb/>
            brother’s son. </note> <pb n="39"/>
            <note type="margin"> B.C. 904.] </note> <lb/>
            kingdom for himself, he restored it, with the noblest integrity, <lb/>
            to Charilaus, the posthumous son of Polyde( tes, as soon as he <lb/>
            became of age ; that all might see how much more the laws of <lb/>
            integrity prevail with good men than all the charms of power. <lb/>
            In the meantime, while the child was growing up, and he <lb/>
            had the guardianship of him, he composed laws for the Spartans, <lb/>
            who previously had had none. Nor was he more celebrated <lb/>
            for the making of these laws, than for his exemplary con­ <lb/>
            formity to them; for he imposed nothing by law upon others, <lb/>
            of the observation of which he did not first give an example <lb/>
            in his own conduct. He trained the people to be obedient to <lb/>
            those in authority, and those in authority to be just in the <lb/>
            exercise of their government. He enjoined frugality on all, <lb/>
            thinking that the toils of war would be made more endurable by a <lb/>
            constant observance of it. He ordered all purchases to be made, <lb/>
            not with money, but by exchange of commodities. The use of <lb/>
            gold and silver he prohibited, as being the origin of all evils.</p>
          <p>III. He divided the administration of the government <lb/>
            among the several orders; to the kings he gave the power of <lb/>
            making war, to the magistrates the seats of justice in yearly <lb/>
            succession; to the senate, the guardianship of the laws; to the <lb/>
            people, the power of choosing the senate, or of creating what <lb/>
            magistrates they pleased. The lands of the whole state he <lb/>
            divided equally among all, that equality of possession might <lb/>
            leave no one more powerful than another. He ordered all to <lb/>
            take their meals in public, that no man might secretly indulge <lb/>
            in splendour or luxury. He would not allow the young people <lb/>
            to wear more than one dress in a year, nor any one to walk <lb/>
            abroad in finer garments than another, or to fare more <lb/>
            sumptuously, lest imitation of such practices should lead to <lb/>
            general luxury. He ordered boys to be carried, not into the <lb/>
            forum, but into the field, that they might spend their early <lb/>
            years, not in effeminate employments, but in hard labour and <lb/>
            exertion; not suffering them to put any thing under them to <lb/>
            sleep upon, or to live on high seasoned food, and forbidding <lb/>
            them to return into the city till they arrived at manhood. <lb/>
            He caused virgins to be married without portions, that wives, <lb/>
            not money, might be sought; and that husbands might govern <lb/>
            their wives more strictly, being influenced by no regard to <lb/>
            dowry. He ordained that the highest respect should be paid, <lb/>
            not to the rich and powerful, but to the old, according to <unclear>thei</unclear> <pb n="40"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.III. CH.IV. </note> <lb/>
            degrees of seniority ; nor had old age, indeed, a more honour­ <lb/>
            able habitation anywhere than at Sparta.</p>
          <p>But seeing that such laws would at first be thought severe, <lb/>
            as the state of manners had previously been relaxed, he <lb/>
            represented that Apollo of Delphi was the author of them, and <lb/>
            that he had brought them from thence at the command of the <lb/>
            deity, in order that reverence for religion might overbalance <lb/>
            the irksomeness of compliance with them. And to secure <lb/>
            perpetuity to his laws, he bound the city by an oath “to make <lb/>
            no change in them till he should return," pretending that he was <lb/>
            going to ask the oracle at Delphi whether any thing seemed <lb/>
            necessary to be added to his institutions, or changed in them <lb/>
            But he went in reality to Crete, and continued there it, <lb/>
            voluntary exile; and, when he was dying, ordered his bones <lb/>
            to be thrown into the sea, lest, if they were taken back to <lb/>
            Lacedæmon, the Spartans might think themselves absolved <lb/>
            from their oath respecting alteration in his laws.</p>
          <p>IV. Under such a state of manners, the city acquired, in a <lb/>
            short time,* such a degree of strength, that, on going to war <lb/>
            with the Messenians for offering violence to some of their <lb/>
            maidens at a solemn sacrifice of that people, they bound <lb/>
            themselves under a severe oath not to return till they had taken <lb/>
            Messene, promising themselves so much either from their <lb/>
            strength or good fortune. This occurrence was the commence­ <lb/>
            ment of dissension in Greece, and the origin and cause of a <lb/>
            civil war. But being detained in the siege of this city, con­ <lb/>
            trary to their expectation, for ten years, and called on to return <lb/>
            by the complaints of their wives after so long a widowhood, and <lb/>
            being afraid that by persevering in the war they might hurt <lb/>
            themselves more than the Messenians (for, in Messene, <lb/>
            whatever men were lost in the war, were replaced by the <lb/>
            fruitfulness of their women, while they themselves suffered <lb/>
            constant losses in battle, and could have no offspring from <lb/>
            their wives in the absence of their husbands), they in conse­ <lb/>

            number of young men ; whom they sent back to Sparta with <lb/>
            permission to form promiscuous connexions with all the women <lb/>
            of the city, thinking that conception would be more speedy <lb/>
            if each of the females made the experiment with several men. <lb/>
            Those who sprung from these unions were called Partheniæ,* <lb/>
            as a reflection on their mothers' violated chastity ; and, when <lb/>
            they came to thirty years of age, being alarmed with the fear <lb/>
            of want (for not one of them had a father to whose estate he <lb/>
            could hope to succeed,) they chose a captain named Phalantus, <lb/>
            the son of Aratus, by whose advice the Spartans had sent <lb/>
            home the young men to propagate, that, as they had formerly <lb/>
            had the father for the author of their birth, they might now <lb/>
            have the son as the establisher of their hopes and fortunes. <lb/>
            Without taking leave of their mothers, therefore, from whose <lb/>
            adultery they thought that they derived dishonour, they set <lb/>
            out to seek a place of settlement, and being tossed about <lb/>
            a long time, and with various mischances, they at last arrived <lb/>
            on the coast of Italy, where, after seizing the citadel of the <lb/>
            Tarentines, and expelling the old inhabitants, they fixed their <lb/>
            abode. But several years after, their leader Phalantus, being <lb/>
            driven into exile by a popular tumult, went to Brundusium, <lb/>
            whither the former inhabitants of Tarentum had retreated <lb/>
            after they were expelled from their city. When he was at <lb/>
            the point of death, he urged the exiles “to have his bones, <lb/>
            and last relics, bruised to dust, and privately sprinkled in the <lb/>
            forum of Tarentum ; for that Apollo at Delphi had signified <lb/>
            that by this means they might recover their city.” They, <lb/>
            thinking that he had revealed the destiny of his countrymen <lb/>
            to avenge himself, complied with his directions; but the <lb/>
            intention of the oracle was exactly the reverse; for it <lb/>
            promised the Spartans, upon the performance of what he had <lb/>
            said, not the loss, but the perpetual possession of the city. <lb/>
            Thus by the subtlety of their exiled captain, and the agency <lb/>
            of their enemies, the possession of Tarentum was secured to <lb/>
            the Partheniæ for ever.</p>
          <p>V. Meantime the Messenians, who could not be conquered <lb/>
            by valour, were reduced by stratagem. For eighty years they <lb/>
            bore the severe afflictions of slaves, as frequent stripes, and <lb/>
            chains, and other evils of subjugation; and then, after so long an <note type="footnote"> * From <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρϑένος</foreign>, virgo.] It answers exactly to the German <unclear>ein</unclear> <lb/>

            endurance of suffering, they proceeded to resume hostilities. <lb/>
            The Lacedæmonians, at the same time, ran to arms with the <lb/>
            greater ardour and unanimity, because they seemed to be <lb/>
            called upon to fight against their own slaves. While ill- <lb/>
            treatment, therefore, on the one side, and indignation on the <lb/>
            other, exasperated their feelings, the Lacedæmonians con <lb/>
            sulted the oracle at Delphi concerning the event of the war, <lb/>
            and were directed to ask the Athenians for a leader to con­ <lb/>
            duct it The Athenians, learning the answer of the oracle, <lb/>
            sent, to express their contempt of the Spartans a lame poet, <lb/>
            named Tyrtæus; who, being routed in three battles, reduced <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians to so desperate a condition, that, to re <lb/>
            cruit their army, they liberated a portion of their slaves, <lb/>
            promising that they should marry the widows of those who <lb/>
            were slain, and thus fill up, not merely the number of the <lb/>
            lost citizens, but their offices. The kings of Sparta, however, <lb/>
            lest, by contending against fortune, they should bring greater <lb/>
            losses on their city, would have drawn off their army, had not <lb/>
            Tyrtæus interposed, and recited to the soldiers, in a public <lb/>
            assembly, some verses of his own composition, in which he <lb/>
            had comprised exhortations to courage, consolations for their <lb/>
            losses, and counsels concerning the war. By this means he <lb/>
            inspired the soldiers with such resolution, that, being no <lb/>
            longer concerned for their lives, but merely for the rites of <lb/>
            sepulture, they tied on their right arms tickets, inscribed with <lb/>
            their names and those of their fathers, that if an unsuccessful <lb/>
            battle should cut them off, and their features after a time be­ <lb/>
            come indistinct, they might be consigned to burial according <lb/>
            to the indication of the inscriptions. When the kings saw <lb/>
            the army thus animated, they took care that the state of it <lb/>
            should be made known to the enemy; the report, however, <lb/>
            raised in the Messenians no alarm, but a correspondent <lb/>
            ardour. Both sides accordingly encountered with such fury, <lb/>
            that there scarcely ever was a more bloody battle. But at last <lb/>
            victory fell to the Lacedæmonians.</p>
          <p>VI. Some time after, the Messenians renewed the war a <lb/>
            third time, when the Lacedæmonians, among their other <lb/>
            allies, called also upon the Athenians for assistance; but <lb/>
            afterwards, conceiving some mistrust of them, they prevented <lb/>
            them from joining in the war, pretending that they had no <lb/>
            need for their services. The Athenians, not liking this pro- <pb n="43"/>
            <note type="margin"> B.C. 430.] </note> <lb/>
            ceeding, removed the money, which had been contributed by <lb/>
            the whole of Greece to defray the expense of the Persian war, <lb/>
            from Delos to Athens, that, if the Lacedæmonians broke their <lb/>
            faith as allies, it might not be an object of plunder to them. <lb/>
            The Lacedæmonians, on the other hand, did not rest, for though <lb/>
            they were engaged in the war with the Messenians, they set <lb/>
            the people of the Peloponnesus to make war on the Athenians. <lb/>
            The forces of the Athenians at home were at that time incon­ <lb/>
            siderable, as their fleet had been despatched into Egypt, so <lb/>
            that, engaging in battle by sea, they were quickly worsted. Soon <lb/>
            after, on the return of their fleet, being strengthened both by <lb/>
            sea and land, they renewed the war; when the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians, leaving the Messenians at rest, turned their full <lb/>
            force against the Athenians. Victory was long doubtful, and <lb/>
            at last both parties gave over with equal loss. The Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians being then recalled to the war with the Messenians, <lb/>
            but not wishing to leave the Athenians in the meantime un­ <lb/>
            molested, bargained with the Thebans to restore them the <lb/>
            supremacy of Bceotia, which they had lost in the time of the <lb/>
            Persian war, if they would but take up arms against the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians. Such was the fury of the Spartans, that, though they <lb/>
            were involved in two wars, they did not hesitate to occasion <lb/>
            a third, if they might but raise up enemies against their ene­ <lb/>
            mies. The Athenians, therefore, to meet this storm of war, <lb/>
            made choice of two eminent leaders, Pericles, a man of tried <lb/>
            courage, and Sophocles, the writer of tragedies; who, dividing <lb/>
            their forces, laid waste the lands of the Spartans, and brought <lb/>
            many cities of Achaia* under the power of the Athenians.</p>
          <p>VII. The Lacedæmonians, being humbled by these losses, <lb/>
            agreed upon a peace for thirty years. But their hostile <lb/>
            feelings did not allow of so long a period of repose. Hence, <lb/>
            having broken the treaty before the fifteenth year was <lb/>
            ended, they laid waste the territories of Attica in violation <lb/>
            of their obligations towards the gods and towards men. And <lb/>
            lest they should seem to have desired to plunder rather than <lb/>
            to fight, they challenged the enemy to the field. But the <lb/>
            Athenians, by the advice of their leader Pericles, deferred <note type="footnote"> * Achaiæ] So the northern coast of the Peloponnesus was called. <lb/>

            revenge for the spoliation of their lands to a fitter time of <lb/>
            exacting it, thinking it needless to hazard a battle, when they <lb/>
            could avenge themselves on the enemy without risk. Some <lb/>
            days afterwards, accordingly, they embarked in their fleet, and, <lb/>
            while the Lacedæmonians expected nothing of the kind, laid <lb/>
            waste all Sparta,* carrying off much more than they had lost; <lb/>
            so that, in a comparison of their respective sufferings, the <lb/>
            retaliation was much greater than the injury at first received. <lb/>
            This expedition of Pericles was considered as greatly to his <lb/>
            honour; but his disregard of his private property was far <lb/>
            more honourable. The enemy, while they wasted the lands of <lb/>
            others, had left his uninjured; hoping, by this means, either <lb/>
            to bring danger on him by rendering him unpopular, or dis. <lb/>
            honour by making him suspected of treachery. But Pericles, <lb/>
            foreseeing what would happen, had both foretold it to the <lb/>
            people, and, to escape the effects of popular odium, had made <lb/>
            over his lands to the state as a gift; and thus obtained the <lb/>
            greatest honour from that by which his ruin had been in­ <lb/>
            tended. Some days afterwards, an engagement took place by <lb/>
            sea; and the Lacedæmonians, being worsted, fled. Neverthe­ <lb/>
            less they did not cease from fierce attacks on one another, by <lb/>
            sea or land, with various success. At last, exhausted with <lb/>
            disasters on both sides, they made peace for fifty years, which <lb/>
            however they maintained only for six; for they broke the <lb/>
            treaty which they had concluded on their own account, under <lb/>
            pretence of assisting their allies ; as if they were less guilty <lb/>
            of perjury by aiding their dependants, than by engaging in <lb/>
            open hostilities themselves.</p>
          <p>The war was in consequence transferred into Sicily; but <lb/>
            before I relate its progress, it is proper to give some ac­ <lb/>

          <p>I. IT is said that Sicily was formerly joined to Italy by a <lb/>
            narrow pass,. and was torn off, as it were, from the larger body, <lb/>
            by the violence of the upper sea,t which impels itself in that <lb/>
            direction with the whole force of its waters. The soil itself, <lb/>
            too, is light and frangible, and so perforated with caverns and <lb/>
            passages, that it is almost everywhere open to blasts of wind ; <lb/>
            and the very matter of it is naturally adapted for generating <lb/>
            and nourishing fire, as it is said to be impregnated with <lb/>
            sulphur and bitumen, a circumstance which is the cause that <lb/>
            when air contends with fire in the subterraneous parts, the <lb/>
            earth frequently, and in several places, sends forth flame, or <lb/>
            vapour, or smoke. Hence it is that the fire of Mount Ætna <lb/>
            has lasted through so many ages. And when a strong wind <lb/>
            passes in through the openings of the cavities, heaps of sand <lb/>
            are cast up.</p>
          <p>The promontory of Italy on the side nearest to Sicily, is <lb/>
            called Rhegium,‡ <unclear>beeause</unclear> things broken off are designated by <lb/>
            that term in Greek. Nor is it strange that antiuity should <lb/>
            have been full of fables concerning these parts, in which so many <lb/>
            extraordinary things are found together. The sea, in the first <lb/>
            place, is nowhere so impetuous, pouring on with a current not <lb/>
            only rapid but furious, not only frightful to those who feel its <lb/>
            effects, but to those who view it from a distance. So fierce is <lb/>
            the conflict of the waves as they meet, that you may see some <lb/>
            of them, put to flight as it were, sink down into the depths, <lb/>
            and others, as if victorious, rising up to the skies. Sometimes, <lb/>
            in one part, you may hear the roaring of the sea as it boils <note type="footnote"> * Angustis faucibus.] It was supposed that the two countries had <lb/>
            formed one tract of land, with merely a narrow valley or defile <lb/>
            between them, and that the sea rushed into this valley and split them <lb/>
            asunder. </note><note type="footnote"> t Superi maris.] The Adriatic. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ From <foreign xml:lang="grc">ῥήγνυμι</foreign>, to break. </note> <pb n="46"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.IV. CH.II </note> <lb/>
            up; and again, in another part, the groaning of it as it sinks <lb/>
            into a whirlpool. Next are to be observed the adjacent and <lb/>
            everlasting fires of Mount Ætna and the Æolian islands, <lb/>
            which burn as if their heat were nourished by the sea itself; <lb/>
            nor indeed could such a quantity of fire have endured in such <lb/>
            narrow bounds for so many ages unless it were supported by <lb/>
            nourishment from the water.. Hence fables produced Scylla <lb/>
            and Charybdis; hence barkings were thought to have been <lb/>
            heard ; hence the appearances of monsters gained credit, as <lb/>
            the sailors, frightened at the vast whirlpools of the subsiding <lb/>
            waters, imagined that the waves, which the vortex of the <lb/>
            absorbent gulf clashes together, actually barked. The same <lb/>
            cause makes the fires of Mount Ætna perpetual; for the <lb/>
            shock of the waters forces into the depths a portion of air <lb/>
            hurried along with it, and then keeps it confined till, being <lb/>
            diffused through the pores of the earth, it kindles the matter <lb/>
            which nourishes the fire.</p>
          <p>In addition, the proximity of Italy and Sicily is to be <lb/>
            noticed, with the heights of their respective promontories, <lb/>
            which are so similar, that, whatever wonder they raise in us <lb/>
            in the present day, they excited proportionate terror in the <lb/>
            ancients, who believed that whole ships were intercepted and <lb/>
            destroyed by the promontories closing together and opening. <lb/>
            Nor was this invented by the ancients to gratify the hearer <lb/>
            with a fabulous wonder, but occasioned by the terror and con­ <lb/>
            sternation of those who passed by those parts; for such is the <lb/>
            appearance of the coasts to any one beholding them from a <lb/>
            distance, that you would take the passage between them for a <lb/>
            bay in the sea, and not a strait; and, as you draw nearer, you <lb/>
            would think that the promontories, which were before united, <lb/>
            part asunder and separate.</p>

            should suppose that he had an idea like that of Sir Humphrey Davy, <lb/>

            it was called Sicania.* It was originally the abode of the <lb/>
            Cyclops; when they became extinct, Cocalus made himself <lb/>
            ruler of the island. After his time the cities fell severally <lb/>
            under the dominion of tyrants, of whom no country was <lb/>
            more productive. One of them, Anaxilaus, strove to be as <lb/>
            just as the others were cruel, and reaped no small advantage <lb/>
            from his equity ; for having left, at his death, some sons very <lb/>
            young, and having committed the guardianship of them to <lb/>
            Micythus, a slave of tried fidelity, so great was the respect <lb/>
            paid to his memory among all his subjects, that they chose <lb/>
            rather to submit to a slave than to abandon the king's <lb/>
            children; and the noblemen of the state, forgetful of their <lb/>
            dignity, suffered the authority of government to be exercised <lb/>
            by a bondman. The Carthaginians, too, attempted to gain <lb/>
            the sovereignty of Sicily, and fought against the tyrants for a <lb/>
            long time with various success; but at length, after losing <lb/>
            their general Hamilcar and his army, they remained quiet for <lb/>
            some time in consequence of that defeat.</p>
          <p>III. In the meantime, the people of Rhegium being <lb/>
            troubled with dissension, and the city being divided by <lb/>
            disputes into two factions, a body of veteran soldiers from <lb/>
            Himera, who were invited by one of the parties to their assist­ <lb/>
            ance, having first expelled from the city those against whom <lb/>
            they had been called, and then put to the sword those whom <lb/>
            they had come to aid, took the government into their <lb/>
            own hands, and made prisoners of the wives and children of <lb/>
            their allies; venturing upon an atrocity to which that of no <lb/>
            tyrant can be compared ; so that it would have been better for <lb/>
            the Rhegians to have been conquered than to conquer ;f for <lb/>
            whether they had become slaves to their conquerors by the <lb/>
            laws of war,‡ or, withdrawing from their country, had been <lb/>
            necessitated to live in exile, yet they would not have been <lb/>
            butchered amidst their altars and household gods, and have <lb/>
            left their country, with their wives and children, a prey to <lb/>
            the most cruel of tyrants. <note type="footnote"> * From the Sicani, an Iberian tribe, according to Dionysius <lb/>

          <p>The people of Catana, also, finding themselves oppressed <lb/>
            by the Syracusans, and distrusting their own power to with­ <lb/>
            stand them, requested assistance from the Athenians, who <lb/>
            whether from desire of enlarging their dominions, so that <lb/>
            they might master all Greece and Asia, or from apprehension <lb/>
            of a fleet lately built by the Syracusans, and to prevent such <lb/>
            a force from joining the Lacedæmonians, sent Lamponius, as <lb/>
            general, with a naval armament into Sicily, that under <lb/>
            pretence of assisting the people of Catana, they might <lb/>
            endeavour to secure the sovereignty of the whole island. <lb/>
            Having succeeded in their first attempts, and made havoc <lb/>
            among the enemy on several occasions, they despatched <lb/>
            another expedition to Sicily, with a greater fleet and more <lb/>
            numerous army, under the command of Laches and Chariades. <lb/>
            But the people of Catana, whether from fear of the Athenians, <lb/>
            or from being weary of the war, made peace with the Syra­ <lb/>
            cusans, and sent back the Athenian force that had come to <lb/>
            assist them.</p>
          <p>IV. After a lapse of some time, however, as the articles of the <lb/>
            peace were not observed by the Syracusans, they sent ambassa­ <lb/>
            dors a second time to Athens, who, arriving in a mean dress, <lb/>
            with long hair and beards, and every sign of distress adapted <lb/>
            to move pity, presented themselves in that wretched <unclear>plignt</unclear> <lb/>
            before the public assembly. To their entreaties were added <lb/>
            tears; and the suppliants so moved the people to compassion, <lb/>
            that the commanders who had withdrawn the auxiliary force <lb/>
            from them received a sentence of condemnation.- A powerful <lb/>
            fleet was then appointed to aid them ; Nicias, Alcibiades, and <lb/>
            Lamachus were made captains; and Sicily was revisited with <lb/>
            such a force as was a terror even to those to whose aid it was <lb/>
            sent. In a short time, Alcibiades being recalled to answer <lb/>
            certain charges made against him, Nicias and Lamachus fought <lb/>
            two successful battles by land, and, drawing lines of circum­ <lb/>
            vallation around Syracuse, cut off all supplies from the enemy <lb/>
            by sea, keeping them closely blocked up in the city. The <lb/>
            Syracusans, being greatly reduced by these measures, sought <lb/>
            assistance from the Lacedæmonians, by whom Gylippus alone <lb/>
            was sent; but he was a man equal to whole troops of aux­ <note type="footnote"> * It is not easy to see on what ground such a sentence was pro­ <lb/>
            nounced ; for it is stated at the end of the third chapter that the <lb/>
            Catanians themselves sent back their Athenian auxiliaries. </note> <pb n="49"/>
            <note type="margin"> B.C. 4<unclear>2</unclear>.] </note> <lb/>
            iFaries. He, having heard on his way of the declining state <lb/>
            ot the war, and having collected some support partly from <lb/>
            Greece and partly from Sicily, took possession of some posts <lb/>
            suitable for carrying on the war. He was then conquered in <lb/>
            two battles, but engaging in a third, he killed Lamachus, put <lb/>
            the enemy to flight, and rescued his allies from the siege. <lb/>
            But as the Athenians transferred their warlike efforts from <lb/>
            the land to the sea, Gylippus sent for a fleet and army from <lb/>
            Lacedæmon; upon intelligence of which the Athenians <lb/>
            themselves, too, sent out Demosthenes and Eurymedon, in the <lb/>
            room of their late leader, with a reinforcement to their troops. <lb/>
            The Peloponnesians again, by a general resolution of their <lb/>
            cities, sent powerful assistance to the Syracusans, and, as it <lb/>
            the Greek war had been transported into Sicily, the contest <lb/>
            was pursued on both sides with the utmost vigour.</p>
          <p>V. In the first encounter at sea. the Athenians were <lb/>
            worsted, and lost their camp, with all their money, both what <lb/>
            was public and what belonged to private individuals. When, <lb/>
            in addition to these disasters, they were also beaten in a <lb/>
            battle on land, Demosthenes began to advise that “they <lb/>
            should quit Sicily, while their condition, though bad, was not <lb/>
            yet desperate; and that they should not persist in a war so <lb/>
            inauspiciously commenced, as there were more considerable, <lb/>
            and perhaps more unhappy wars, to be dreaded at home, for <lb/>
            which it was expedient that they should reserve the present <lb/>
            force of their city." But Nicias, whether from shame at his <lb/>
            ill success, from fear of the resentment of his countrymen for <lb/>
            the disappointment of their hopes, or from the impulse of <lb/>
            destiny, contended for staying. The war by sea was therefore <lb/>
            renewed, and their thoughts turned from reflections on their <lb/>
            previous ill-fortune to the hopes of a successful struggle, but, <lb/>
            through the unskilfulness of their leaders, who attacked the <lb/>
            Syracusans when advantageously posted in a strait, they were <lb/>
            easily overcome. Their general, Eurymedon, was the first to <lb/>
            fall, fighting bravely in the front of the battle; and thirty <lb/>
            ships which he commanded were burnt. Demosthenes and <lb/>
            Nicias being also defeated, set their forces on shore, thinking <lb/>
            that retreat would be safer by land. Gylippus seized a <lb/>
            hundred and thirty ships which they had left, and then, <lb/>
            pursuing them as they fled, took some of them prisoners, and <lb/>
            put others to death. Demosthenes, after the loss of his troops <note type="footnote"> a </note> <pb n="50"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.V. CH.I.</note> <lb/>
            saved himself from captivity by voluntarily falling on his sword. <lb/>
            But Nicias, not induced, even by the example of Demosthenes, <lb/>
            to put himself out of the power of fortune, added to the loss of <lb/>
            his army the disgrace of being made prisoner.</p>

            Athens in his absence of having divulged the mysteries of <lb/>
            Ceres, which were rendered sacred by nothing more than by <lb/>
            their secrecy. Being recalled from the war to take his trial, <lb/>
            and being unwilling, either from the consciousness of guilt <lb/>
            or from the affront put upon him, to obey, he retired, without <lb/>
            offering to defend himself, to Elis. From thence, having <lb/>
            learned that he was not only condemned, but devoted to <lb/>
            destruction with execrations in the religious ceremonies of all <lb/>
            the priests, he betook himself to Lacedæmon, where he urged <lb/>
            the king- of the Lacedæmonians to make war on the Athenians <lb/>
            in the midst of their distress at the unfortunate result of the <lb/>
            struggle in Sicily. This being done, all the powers 01 <lb/>
            Greece conspired against the Athenians, as if to extinguish <lb/>
            a common conflagration; such hatred had they brought upon <lb/>
            themselves by their desire of too great power. Darius also, <lb/>
            the king of Persia, not forgetting his father's and grandfather's <lb/>
            hostility to that city, concluded an alliance with the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians through Tissaphornes, satrap of Lydia, and promised <lb/>
            to defray all the expense of the war. Such at least was his <lb/>
            pretext for meddling in the affairs of Greece, but in reality he <note type="footnote"> * Agis. </note> <pb n="51"/>
            <note type="margin"> B.C. 410.] </note> <lb/>
            was afraid that the Lacedæmonians, if they conquered the <lb/>
            Athenians, should turn their arms against himself. Who then <lb/>
            can wonder that the flourishing state of Athens went to ruin, <lb/>
            when the whole strength of the east conspired to overwhelm <lb/>
            one city ? Yet they did not fall with merely a faint struggle, <lb/>
            or without bloodshed, but fighting to the last, and sometimes <lb/>
            victorious, being rather worn out by changes of fortune than <lb/>
            overcome by force of arms. At the commencement of the <lb/>
            war, too, all their allies deserted them, according to common <lb/>
            practice; for whatever way fortune leans, in the same direction <lb/>
            does the favour of mankind turn.</p>
          <p>II. Alcibiades also supported tne war raised against his <lb/>
            country, not with the services of a common soldier, but with <lb/>
            the abilities of a general. Having received a squadron of five <lb/>
            ships, he sailed directly to Asia, and, by the authority of his <lb/>
            name, prevailed on the cities tributary to the Athenians to <lb/>
            revolt from them. They knew his eminence at home; nor <lb/>
            did they think his influence weakened by his banishment, but <lb/>
            looked on him rather as a leader taken from the Athenians,* <lb/>
            than added to the Lacedæmonians, and balanced the command <lb/>
            which he had gained against that which he had lost. But <lb/>
            among the Lacedæmonians the abilities of Alcibiades had <lb/>
            gained him more envy than favour; and the chief men having <lb/>
            formed a plot to kill him, as their rival in glory, Alcibiades, <lb/>
            receiving intelligence of their design from the wife of Agis, <lb/>
            with whom he had an intrigue, fled to Tissaphemes, the <lb/>
            satrap of king Darius, with whom he quickly ingratiated <lb/>
            himself by his affability and obligingness of manners. He <lb/>
            was then in the flower of youth, and distinguished for personal <lb/>
            graces, and not less for oratory, even among the Athenians. <lb/>
            But he was better fitted to gain the affections of friends than <lb/>
            to keep them; because the vices in his character were thrown <lb/>
            into the shade by the splendour of his eloquence. He suc­ <lb/>
            ceeded in persuading Tissaphemes not to furnish such supplies <note type="footnote"> * They did not so much regard him as a leader deprived of his <lb/>
            command by the Athenians, as one who had been entrusted with a <lb/>
            similar command by the Lacedæmonians. " Although he bad lost his <lb/>
            appointment with the Athenians, they considered that he was advanced <lb/>
            to equal dignity among the Lacedæmonians.”—Berneccerus. "The <lb/>
            office of general, which he had lost on the one side, he had recovered <lb/>

            cf money for the Lacedæmonian fleet; “for the Ionians," <lb/>
            he said, " should be called upon to pay their share, since it <lb/>
            was for their deliverance, when they were paying tribute to <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians, that the war was undertaken. Neither, <lb/>
            however," he added, " should the Lacedæmonians be too <lb/>
            greatly assisted ; for he should remember that he was pre­ <lb/>
            paring a way for the supremacy of others, not for his own; <lb/>
            and that the war was only so far to be supported, that it <lb/>
            might not be broken off for want of supplies, as the king <lb/>
            of Persia, while the Greeks were distracted by dissensions, <lb/>
            would be the arbiter of peace and war, and would vanquish <lb/>
            with their own arms those whom he could not overcome with <lb/>
            his own ; but that, if the war were brought to a conclusion, <lb/>
            he would immediately have to fight with the conquerors. <lb/>
            That Greece, therefore, ought to be reduced by civil wars, <lb/>
            so that it might have no opportunity to engage in foreign <lb/>
            ones; that the strength of its two parties should be kept <lb/>
            equal, the weaker being constantly supported; since the <lb/>
            Spartans, who professed themselves the defenders of the <lb/>
            liberty of Greece, would not remain quiet after their present <lb/>
            elevation." Such arguments wore very agreeable to Tissa­ <lb/>
            phernes; and he accordingly furnished supplies to the <lb/>
            Spartans but sparingly, and did not send the whole of the <lb/>
            king's fleet to assist them, lest he should gain them a complete <lb/>
            victory, or bring the other party under the necessity of aban­ <lb/>
            doning the war.</p>
          <p>III. Meanwhile Alcibiades boasted of this service to his <lb/>
            countrymen ; and when deputies from the Athenians came to <lb/>
            him, be promised to secure them the king's friendship, if the <lb/>
            government should be transferred from the hands of the <lb/>
            people to those of the senate; in hopes, either that, if the <lb/>
            citizens could agree, he should be chosen general unanimously, <lb/>
            or that, if dissension arose between the two orders, he should <lb/>
            be invited by one of the parties to their assistance. The <lb/>
            Athenians, as a dangerous war hung over them, were more <lb/>
            solicitous about their safety than their dignity.. The govern­ <lb/>
            ment, accordingly, was transferred, with the consent of the <note type="footnote"> * Major salutis, quàm dignitatis, cura fuit.] The Athenians sub­ <lb/>
            mitted to the condition imposed by the king of Persia, viz., that of <lb/>

            people, to the senate. But as the nobility, with the pride <lb/>
            natural to their order, treated the common people cruelly, and <lb/>
            each arrogated to himself the exorbitant power of tyranny, the <lb/>
            banished Alcibiades was recalled by the army, and appointed <lb/>
            to the command of the fleet. Upon this, he at once sent notice <lb/>
            to Athens that, “he would instantly march to the city with <lb/>
            his army, and recover the rights of the people from the four <lb/>
            hundred,* unless they restored them of themselves." The <lb/>
            aristocracy, alarmed at this denunciation, at first attempted to <lb/>
            betray the city to the Lacedæmonians, but being unable to <lb/>
            succeed, went into exile. Alcibiades, having delivered his <lb/>
            country from this intestine evil, fitted out his fleet with the <lb/>
            utmost care, and proceeded to carry forward the war with the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians.</p>
          <p>IV. Mindarus and Phamabazus, the leaders of the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians,t were already waiting at Sestos with their fleet <lb/>
            drawn up. A battle being fought, the victory fell to the <lb/>
            Athenians. In this engagement, the greater part of the army <lb/>
            and almost all the enemy's officers, were killed, and eighty <lb/>
            ships taken. Some days after, the Lacedæmonians, trans­ <lb/>
            ferring the war from the sea to the land, were defeated a <lb/>
            second time. Weakened by these disasters, they sued for <lb/>
            peace, but were prevented from obtaining it by the efforts of <lb/>
            those to whom the war brought private advantage. In the <lb/>
            meantime, too, a war made upon Sicily by the Carthaginians <lb/>
            called home the aid sent by the Syracusans; and the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians, in consequence, being wholly unsupported, Alcibiades <lb/>
            ravaged the coast of Asia with his victorious fleet, fought <lb/>
            several battles, and being every where victorious, recovered <lb/>
            the cities which had revolted, took some others, and added <lb/>
            them to the dominion. of the Athenians. Having thus re- <lb/>
            established their ancient glory by sea, and united to it <lb/>
            reputation in war by land, he returned to Athens to gratify <lb/>
            the longing of his countrymen to behold him. In all these <lb/>
            battles two hundred ships of the enemy, and a vast quantity <lb/>
            of spoils, were taken.</p>
          <p>Upon this triumphant return of the army, the whole multi <lb/>
            tude from Athens poured forth to meet them, and gazed with <note type="footnote"> * These four hundred composed the senate. See Thucyd. viii. 67, 68. </note><note type="footnote"> t Lacedæmoniorum duces.] Not strictly ; Mindarus was captain of the <lb/>

            admiration on all the soldiers, but especially on Alcibiades; <lb/>
            on him the whole city turned their eyes with looks of wonder; <lb/>
            they regarded him as sent down from heaven, and as victory <lb/>
            in person; they extolled what he had done for his country, nor <lb/>
            did they less admire what he had done against it in his exile, <lb/>
            excusing his conduct as the result of anger and provocation. <lb/>
            Such power indeed, strange to say, was there * in that one <lb/>
            man, that he was the cause of a great state being subverted <lb/>
            and again re-established; victory removed herself to the side <lb/>
            on which he stood; and a wonderful change of fortune always <lb/>
            attended him. They therefore heaped upon him not only all <lb/>
            human, but divine honours ; they made it an object of conten­ <lb/>
            tion, whether the contumely with which they banished him, or <lb/>
            the honour with which they recalled him, should be the greater. <lb/>
            They, by whose execrations he had been devoted, carried their <lb/>
            gods to meet and congratulate him; and him to whom they <lb/>
            had lately refused all human aid, they now desired, if they <lb/>
            could, to exalt to heaven; they made amends for indignities <lb/>
            with praises, for confiscations with gifts, for imprecations with <lb/>
            prayers. The unfortunate battle on the coast of Sicilyt was no <lb/>
            longer in their mouths, but their success in Greece; t the <lb/>
            fleets which he had lost were no more mentioned, but those <lb/>
            which he had taken; they did not speak of Syracuse, but of <lb/>
            Ionia and the Hellespont. Thus Alcibiades was never <lb/>
            received with moderate feelings on the part of his countrymen, <lb/>
            either when they were offended, or when they were pleased <lb/>
            with him.</p>
          <p>V. During these occurrences at Athens, Lysander was <lb/>
            appointed by the Lacedæmonians to the command of their <lb/>
            fleet and army; and Darius, king of Persia, made, in the <lb/>
            room of Tissaphernes, his son Cyrus governor of Ionia and <lb/>
            Lydia; who, by his assistance and support, inspired the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians with hopes of recovering their former position. <lb/>
            Their strength being therefore recruited, the Spartans, when <lb/>
            their approach was wholly unexpected, surprised Alcibiades, <note type="footnote"> * Enimvero tantum in uno viro fuisse moments, ut, &amp;c.] In such con <lb/>

            who had gone with a hundred vessels to Asia, while he was <lb/>
            laying waste the country, which was in excellent condition <lb/>
            from a long continuance of peace, and while, unapprehensive <lb/>
            of any attack, he had allowed his soldiers to disperse them­ <lb/>
            selves under the attractions of plunder; and such was the <lb/>
            havoc among the scattered troops, that the Athenians received <lb/>
            more injury from that single onslaught, than they had caused <lb/>
            the enemy in their previous battles with them. Such, too, <lb/>
            was the desperation of the Athenians on the occasion, that <lb/>
            they immediately deposed Alcibiades to make room for Conon, <lb/>
            thinking that they had been defeated, not by the fortune of <lb/>
            war, but by the treachery of their general, on whom their <lb/>
            former injuries had had more influence than their recent <lb/>
            favours, and that he had conquered in the former part of the <lb/>
            war, only to show the enemy what a leader they had despised, <lb/>
            and to make his countrymen pay so much the dearer for their <lb/>
            previous victory; for his vigour of mind and laxity of morals <lb/>
            made everything that was said of Alcibiades credible. Fearing <lb/>
            therefore the rage of the people, he went again into voluntary <lb/>
            exile.</p>
          <p>VI. CODon, being put in the place of Alcibiades, and seeing <lb/>
            to what sort of commander he had succeeded, fitted out his <lb/>
            fleet with the utmost exertion; but troops were wanting to <lb/>
            man the vessels, as the stoutest men had been cut off in the <lb/>
            plundering of Asia. Old men, however, and boys under age, <lb/>
            were furnished with arms, and the number of an army was com­ <lb/>
            pleted, but without the strength. But soldiers of an age so <lb/>
            unfit for war could not long protract the contest; they were <lb/>
            everywhere cut to pieces, or taken prisoners as they fled; and <lb/>
            so great was the loss in slain and captured, that not <lb/>
            merely the power of the Athenians, but even their very name, <lb/>
            seemed to be extinct. Their affairs being ruined and rendered <lb/>
            desperate in the contest, they were reduced to such want of <lb/>
            men, all of military age being lost, that they gave the freedom <lb/>
            of the city to foreigners, liberty to slaves, and pardon to con­ <lb/>
            demned malefactors. With an army raised from such a mix­ <lb/>
            ture of human beings, they who had lately been lords of <lb/>
            Greece could scarcely preserve their liberty. Yet they resolved <lb/>
            once more to try their fortune at sea; and such was their <lb/>
            spirit, that though they had recently despaired of safety, they <lb/>
            now did not despair even of victory. But it was not such a <pb n="56"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.V. CH.VII. </note> <lb/>
            soldiery that could support the Athenian name; it was not <lb/>
            such troops with which they had been used to conquer; nor <lb/>
            were there the requisite military accomplishments in those <lb/>
            whom prisons, not camps, had confined. All were in conse <lb/>
            quence either <unclear>ta</unclear> prisoners or slain ; and the general Conon <lb/>
            alone surviving the battle, and dreading the resentment of his <lb/>
            countrymen, went off with eight ships to Evagoras, king cf <lb/>
            Cyprus.</p>
          <p>VII. The general of the Lacedæmonians, after managing <lb/>
            his affairs so successfully, grew insolent towards his enemies in <lb/>
            their evil fortune. He sent the ships which he had taken, <lb/>
            laden with spoil, and decorated as in triumph, to Lacedæmon. <lb/>
            He received at the same time voluntary tenders of submission <lb/>
            from cities which dread of the doubtful fortune of war had kept <lb/>
            in allegiance to the Athenians. Nor did he leave anything in <lb/>
            possession of the Athenians but their city itself.</p>
          <p>When all this was understood at Athens, the inhabitants, <lb/>
            leaving their houses, ran up and down the streets in a frantic <lb/>
            manner, asking questions of one another, and inquiring for the <lb/>
            author of the news. Neither did incapacity keep the children <lb/>
            at home, nor infirmity the old men, nor the weakness of their <lb/>
            sex the women: so deeply had the feeling of such calamity <lb/>
            affected every age. They met together in the forum, where, <lb/>
            through the whole night, they bewailed the public distress. <lb/>
            Some wept for their lost brothers, or sons, or parents; some <lb/>
            for other relatives; others for friends dearer than relatives; all <lb/>
            mingling their lamentations for their country with plaints for <lb/>
            their private sufferings; sometimes regarding themselves, <lb/>
            sometimes their city, as on the brink of ruin; and deeming <lb/>
            the fate of those who survived more unhappy than that of the <lb/>
            slain. Each represented to himself a siege, a famine, and an <lb/>
            enemy overbearing and flushed with victory; sometimes con­ <lb/>
            templating in imagination the desolation and burning of the <lb/>
            city, and sometimes the captivity and wretched slavery of all <lb/>
            its inhabitants ; and thinking the former destruction of Athens, <lb/>
            which was attended only with * the ruin of their houses. while <lb/>
            their children and parents were safe, much less calamitous <lb/>
            than what was now to befal them; since there remained no <lb/>
            fleet in which, as before, they might find a refuge, and no <note type="footnote"> * Taxatæ sint.] Was at the expense of. </note> <pb n="57"/>
            <note type="margin"> B.C. 403.] </note> <lb/>
            army by whose valour they might be saved to erect a finer <lb/>
            city.</p>
          <p>VIII. While the city was thus wept over and almost brought <lb/>
            to nothing, the enemy came upon it, pressed the inhabitants <lb/>
            with a siege, and distressed them with famine. They knew <lb/>
            that little remained of the provisions which they had laid up, <lb/>
            and had taken care that no new ones should be imported. The <lb/>
            Athenians, exhausted by their sufferings, from long endurance <lb/>
            of famine, and daily losses of men, sued for peace; but it <lb/>
            was long disputed between the Spartans and their allies <lb/>
            whether it should be granted or not. Many gave their opinion <lb/>
            that the very name of the Athenians should be blotted out, <lb/>
            and the city destroyed by fire ; but the Spartans refused “ to <lb/>
            pluck out one of the two eyes of Greece," and promised the <lb/>
            Athenians peace, on condition “ that they should demolish the <lb/>
            walls * extending down to the Piræeus, and deliver up the ships <lb/>
            which they had left; and that the state should receive from <lb/>
            them thirty governors of their own citizens." The city being <lb/>
            surrendered on these terms, the Lacedæmonians committed it <lb/>
            to Lysander to model the government of it. This year was <lb/>
            rendered remarkable, not only for the reduction of Athens, <lb/>
            but for the death of Farms, king of Persia, and the banish­ <lb/>
            ment of Dionysius, tyrant of Sicily.</p>
          <p>When the form of government at Athens was changed, the <lb/>
            condition of the citizens was likewise altered. Thirty governors <lb/>
            of the state were appointed, who became absolute tyrants ; for, <lb/>
            at the very first, they organized for themselves a guard of <lb/>
            three thousand men, though, after so much slaughter, scarcely <lb/>
            as many citizens survived ; and as if this force was too small <lb/>
            to overawe the city, they received also seven hundred men <lb/>
            from the victorious army. They then began to put to death <lb/>
            the citizens, intending to commence with Alcibiades, lest he <lb/>
            should again seize the government under pretence of deliver­ <lb/>
            ing the city; and hearing that he was gone to Artaxerxes king <lb/>
            of Persia, they despatched men in haste to stop him on his <lb/>
            way. By these deputies he was beset, and, as he could not <lb/>
            be killed openly, was burnt alive in the apartment in which <lb/>
            he slept.</p>
          <p>IX. The tyrants, thus freed from the dread of an avenger, <lb/>
            wasted the miserable remains of the city with the sword and <note type="footnote"> * Muri brachial The arms of the wall. </note> <pb n="58"/>

            spoliation ; and finding that their proceedings displeased <lb/>
            Theramenes, one of their own body, they put him also to <lb/>
            death to strike terror into the rest. In consequence a general <lb/>
            dispersion of the citizens took place in all directions, and <lb/>
            Greece was filled with Athenian fugitives. But the privilege <lb/>
            of flight being also taken from them (for the cities were <lb/>
            forbidden, by an edict of the Lacedæmonians, to receive the <lb/>
            exiles), they all betook themselves to Argos and Thebes,* <lb/>
            where they had not only safe places of refuge, but also con­ <lb/>
            ceived hopes of repossessing themselves of their country. <lb/>
            There was among the refugees a man named Thrasybulus, a <lb/>
            person of great bravery and of noble extraction, who, thinking <lb/>
            that something should be attempted, even at the utmost <lb/>
            hazard, for their country and the common interest, called <lb/>
            together the exiles, and took post at Phyle, a fort on the <lb/>
            borders of Attica. Some of the cities, pitying the severity <lb/>
            of their misfortunes, afforded them countenance ; Ismenias, <lb/>
            a leading man among the Thebans, though he could not <lb/>
            assist them publicly, yet supported them with his private <lb/>
            means ; and Lycias, the Syracusan orator,f at that time an <lb/>
            exile, sent five hundred soldiers, equipped at his own charge, <lb/>
            to the aid of the common country of eloquence. A desperate <lb/>
            cattle ensued ; but as those on the one side fought with their <lb/>
            utmost efforts to regain their country, and those on the other, <lb/>
            with less eagerness, in support of the power of others, the <lb/>
            tyrants were overcome. After their defeat they fled back <lb/>
            into the city, which, already exhausted by their slaughters, <lb/>
            they despoiled also of its arms. Suspecting all the Athenians, <lb/>
            too, of disaffection towards them, they ordered them to remove <lb/>
            out of the city, and to take up their abode among the ruins of <lb/>
            the walls which had been demolished ; supporting their own <lb/>
            authority with foreign soldiers. Next they endeavoured to <lb/>
            corrupt Thrasybulus, by promising him a share in the govern­ <lb/>
            ment ; but, not succeeding, they sought assistance from Lace­ <lb/>
            daemon, on the arrival of which they took the field again. In <note type="footnote"> * These cities had not obeyed the edict of the Lacedæmonians, but <lb/>

            the tyrants, were killed.</p>
          <p>X. The others being defeated, and their army, of which <lb/>
            the greater part consisted of Athenians running away, <lb/>
            Thrasybulus called out to them with a loud voice, asking, <lb/>
            “Why Why they should flee from him in the midst of victory, <lb/>
            rather than join him as the assertor of their common liberty <lb/>
            adding, that “ they should reflect that his army was composed <lb/>
            of their countrymen, not of enemies; that he had not armed <lb/>
            himself to take any thing away from the conquered, but <lb/>
            to restore them what they had lost; and that he was making <lb/>
            war, not on the city, but on the thirty tyrants." He then <lb/>
            reminded them of their ties of relationship, their laws, their <lb/>
            common religion, and their long service as fellow soldiers in so <lb/>
            many wars. He conjured them, that, "if they themselves <lb/>
            could submit patiently to the yoke, they should yet take pity <lb/>
            on their exiled countrymen ;” he urged them “ to restore him <lb/>
            to his country, and to accept liberty for themselves." By <lb/>
            these exhortations such an effect was produced, that when the <lb/>
            army came back into the city, they ordered the thirty tyrants <lb/>
            to retire to Eleusis, appointing ten commissioners to govern <lb/>
            in their room; who, however, not at all deterred by the fate <lb/>
            of the former tyrants, entered on a similar career of cruelty. <lb/>
            During the course of these proceedings, news arrived at <lb/>
            Lacedæmon that war had broken out at Athens, and king <lb/>
            Pausanias was sent to suppress it, who, touched with com­ <lb/>
            passion for the exiled people, restored the unhappy citizens to <lb/>
            their country, and ordered the ten tyrants to leave the city, <lb/>
            and go to the rest at Eleusis. Peace was restored by these <lb/>
            means; but, after an interval of some days, the tyrants, <lb/>
            enraged at the recal of the exiles not less than at their own <lb/>
            expulsion (as if liberty to others was slavery to themselves), <lb/>
            suddenly resumed hostilities against Athens. As they were <lb/>
            proceeding however to a conference,* apparently with the <lb/>
            expectation of recovering their power, they were seized by an <lb/>
            ambuscade, and offered as sacrifices to peace. The people, <lb/>
            whom they had obliged to leave the city, were recalled; and <lb/>
            the state, which had been divided into several members was <note type="footnote"> * The original stands thus: bellum A theniensibus inferunt; sed lid <lb/>

            at length re-united into one body. And that no dissension <lb/>
            might arise in consequence of anything that had gone before, <lb/>
            the citizens were all bound by an oath that former discords <lb/>
            should be forgotten.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile the Thebans and Corinthians sent ambassadors <lb/>
            to the Lacedæmonians, to demand a share of the spoil acquired <lb/>
            by their common exertions in war, and at their common risk. <lb/>
            Their demand being refused, they did not indeed openly <lb/>
            resolve on war with the Lacedæmonians, but tacitly conceived <lb/>
            such resentment towards them, that it might be seen that war <lb/>
            was likely to arise.</p>
          <p>XI. About the same time died Darius, king of Persia, <lb/>
            leaving two sons, Artaxerxes and Cyrus. He bequeathed the <lb/>
            kingdom to Artaxerxes, and to Cyrus the cities over which he <lb/>
            had been satrap. But Cyrus thought the will of his father an <lb/>
            injustice, and secretly made preparations for war with his <lb/>
            brother. News of his intentions being brought to Artaxerxes, <lb/>
            he sent for him, and, when he pretended innocence, and <lb/>
            denied all thoughts of war, he bound him with golden fetters,. <lb/>
            and would have put him to death, had not his mother <lb/>
            interposed. Cyrus, in consequence of her intercession, being <lb/>
            allowed to depart, began to prepare for war, no longer secretly, <lb/>
            but publicly, not with dissimulation, but with an open avowal <lb/>
            of it, and assembled auxiliary troops from all quarters. The <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians, remembering that they had been vigorously <lb/>
            aided by him in the war with Athens, and as if in ignorance <lb/>
            against whom hostilities were intended, resolved that <lb/>
            “ assistance should be sent to Cyrus whenever his necessities <lb/>
            should require;" hoping thus to secure favour with Cyrus, and <lb/>
            a plea for pardon with Artaxerxes if he should have the <lb/>
            advantage, because they had decreed nothing openly against <lb/>
            him. But when they came to an encounter, fortune throwing <lb/>
            the brothers together in the field, Artaxerxes was first wounded <lb/>
            by Cyrus, but being rescued from danger by the speed of his <lb/>
            horse, Cyrus was overpowered by the king's battalion, and <lb/>
            slain. Thus Artaxerxes being victorious, got possession both <lb/>
            of the spoil from the war with his brother, and of his brother’s <note type="footnote"> * That proper respect might be paid to him as one of the royal <lb/>

            side of Cyrus, who had the superiority in the wing on which <lb/>
            they had been posted, and, after the death of Cyrus, could <lb/>
            neither be reduced forcibly by the vast army of their ad­ <lb/>
            versaries, nor captured by stratagem, but, returning through <lb/>
            so many wild and barbarous nations, and over such vast tracts <lb/>

            power, they began to aspire to the dominion of all Asia. But <lb/>
            the greater part of it was under the government of the <lb/>
            Persians; and Dercyllidas, being chosen general to conduct <lb/>
            the war against them, and seeing that he would be opposed to <lb/>
            two satraps of Artaxerxes. Pharnabazus and Tissaphemes, <lb/>
            supported by the strength of powerful nations, resolved to <lb/>
            make peace with one of them. As Tissaphernes seemed the <lb/>
            fitter of the two for his purpose, being more attentive to <lb/>
            business, and better furnished with troops (having with him <lb/>
            those of the late prince Cyrus), he was invited to a conference, <lb/>
            and induced to lay down his arms on certain conditions. This <lb/>
            transaction Pharnabazus made matter of accusation to their <lb/>
            common sovereign, acquainting him that " Tissaphernes had <lb/>
            not taken arms to repel the Lacedæmonians on their invasion <lb/>
            of Asia, but had maintained them at the king's charge, and <lb/>
            bargained with them as to what they should put off doing in <pb n="62"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.VI. CH.II. </note> <lb/>
            the war, and what they should carry into execution, as if every <lb/>
            loss did not affect the interest of the one empire in general,' <lb/>
            adding that " it was disgraceful that war should not be decided <lb/>
            by the sword, but bought off, and that the enemy should be <lb/>
            induced to retire, not by arms, but by money." When by <lb/>
            such charges he had irritated the king against Tissaphemes, <lb/>
            he advised him to appoint in his place, as commander by sea, <lb/>
            Conon the Athenian, who, having left his country on account <lb/>
            of his ill success, was living in exile in Cyprus ; “ for though <lb/>
            the power of the Athenians," he said, “ was reduced, their <lb/>
            experience at sea was still left them, and that, were a choice <lb/>
            to be made from them all, no one could be preferred to <lb/>
            Conon." Pharnabazus was accordingly furnished with five <lb/>
            hundred talents, and directed to set Conon over the fleet.</p>
          <p>II. When this arrangement was publicly known, the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians, through their ambassadors, requested aid for their <lb/>
            efforts by sea from Hercynio,* king of Egypt, by whom a <lb/>
            hundred triremes, and six hundred thousand modiit of corn, <lb/>
            were despatched to them, while from their other allies a great <lb/>
            number of forces were also assembled. But for such an army, <lb/>
            and against such a leader, an efficient commander was want­ <lb/>
            ing ; and when the auxiliaries desired Agesilaus, then king of <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians, for their general, the Lacedæmonians, in <lb/>
            consequence of an answer from the oracle at Delphi, were <lb/>
            long in doubt whether they should appoint him to the chief <lb/>
            command, as it was signified to them that " there would be an <lb/>
            end of their power when the kingly authority should be <lb/>
            lame and Agesilaus was lame of one foot. At last they de­ <lb/>
            cided that “ it was better for the king to halt in his gait than <lb/>
            for the kingdom to halt in its power and when they after­ <lb/>
            wards sent Agesilaus, with a large army into Asia, 1 cannot <lb/>
            easily tell what other two generals were ever so well matched ; <lb/>
            for the age, valour, conduct, and wisdom of both were nearly <lb/>
            equal, as was also the fame of their achievements; and <lb/>
            fortune, who had given them equal qualifications, had kept <lb/>
            the one from being conquered by the other. Great prepara­ <lb/>
            tions for war, therefore, were made by both, and great deeds <note type="footnote"> * Called Psammitichus by Diodorus Siculus, xiv. 35.—Wetzel. </note><note type="footnote"> t The modius was not quite half a peck. Its exact content was <lb/>

            were performed. But a mutiny among his soldiers arose to <lb/>
            trouble Conon, in consequence of the king's officers making it <lb/>
            a practice to defraud them of their pay; and they demanded <lb/>
            their arrears the more obstinately, as they anticipated that <lb/>
            service under so great a general would be very severe. <lb/>
            Conon, having long importuned the king by letters to no <lb/>
            purpose, went at last to him in person, but was debarred from <lb/>
            any interview or conference with him, because he would not <lb/>
            do him homage* after the manner of the Persians. He, <lb/>
            however, treated with him through his ministers, and com­ <lb/>
            plained that “ the wars of the richest king in the world <lb/>
            ended in nothing through want of pay; and that he who had <lb/>
            an army equal to that of the enemy, was defeated by means <lb/>
            of money in which he was their superior, and found inferior <lb/>
            to them in that article of power in which he had far the ad­ <lb/>
            vantage of them." He also desired that one paymaster might <lb/>
            be appointed for his troops, as it was evidently detrimental to <lb/>
            commit that office to several. Money for his soldiers was <lb/>
            then given him, and he returned to the fleet. Nor did he <lb/>
            delay to enter on action; he executed many undertakings <lb/>
            with resolution, many with success; he laid waste the enemy's <lb/>
            country, stormed their towns, and bore down everything <lb/>
            before him like a hurricane. The Lacedæmonians were so <lb/>
            alarmed at his progress, that they resolved on recalling Agesi <lb/>
            laus t from Asia to the support of his country.</p>
          <p>III. In the meantime Pisander, who had been left governor <lb/>
            of his country by Agesilaus at his departure, fitted out a <lb/>
            powerful fleet with the utmost exertion, determining to try <lb/>
            the fortune of war. Conon, too, on the other hand, being <lb/>
            then to encounter the enemy's army for the first time, put his <lb/>
            troops in order with the greatest care. The emulation <lb/>
            between the generals in the contest was not greater than that <lb/>
            oetween the soldiers. Conon himself, in his character of <lb/>
            leader, did not so much regard the interest of the Persians as <lb/>
            the honour of his own country ; and as, when the strength of <lb/>
            the Athenians was reduced, he had occasioned the utter loss <note type="footnote"> * A dorare.] See C. Nepos, Life of CODon, c. 9. </note><note type="footnote"> t Justin is here in error; for it was not the proceedings of Conon <lb/>

            of their power, so he had a desire to be accounted its restorer, <lb/>
            as well as to reinstate himself in his country by a victory <lb/>
            from which he had been exiled through being defeated; and <lb/>
            this the more remarkably as he was not to fight with the aid <lb/>
            of the Athenians themselves, but with that of a foreign state ; <lb/>
            he was going to contend at the risk of the king, but to <lb/>
            conquer to the advantage of his country, acquiring glory by <lb/>
            means dissimilar from those by which the former generals of <lb/>
            Athens had obtained it, for they had defended their country <lb/>
            by defeating the Persians, but he would re-establish his coun­ <lb/>
            try by making the Persians victorious. Pisander too, from his <lb/>
            relationship to Agesilaus,* was also an emulator of his virtues, <lb/>
            and endeavoured not to fall short of his exploits and the bril­ <lb/>
            liancy of his renown, and not to overthrow, by the misconduct <lb/>
            of a moment, a power which had been gained by so many wars <lb/>
            through so many ages. The anxiety of all the soldiers and <lb/>
            sailors was similar, being not so much concerned t that they <lb/>
            might not lose the power which they had got, as that the <lb/>
            Athenians might not recover their former eminence. But the <lb/>
            more spirited was the struggle, the more honourable was the <lb/>
            victory of Conon. The Lacedæmonians were routed and put <lb/>
            to flight; the garrison of the enemy was withdrawn from <lb/>
            Athens; the people were restored to their rights, and their <lb/>
            bondage was at an end; and several cities were reduced to <lb/>
            their former state of obedience.</p>
          <p>IV. To the Athenians this event was the beginning of their <lb/>
            restoration to power; to the Lacedæmonians it was the ter­ <lb/>
            mination of their authority; for, as if they had lost their spirit <lb/>
            with their pre-eminence, they began to be regarded with con­ <lb/>
            tempt by their neighbours. The first people that made war <lb/>
            upon them, with the aid of the Athenians, were the Thebans ; <lb/>
            a state which, by the abilities of its general, Epaminondas, <lb/>
            was raised from the most humble condition to the hope of <lb/>
            governing Greece. A battle was fought between the two <lb/>
            powers by land, with the same fortune on the part of the <note type="footnote"> * Pro conjunctione <unclear>Agesilai</unclear> He was Agesilaus's wife's brother. See <lb/>

            Lacedæmonians as they had experienced against Conon by <lb/>
            sea. In this encounter Lysander, under whose conduct the <lb/>
            Athenians had been defeated by the Lacedæmonians, was kiled. <lb/>
            Pausanias also, the other general of the Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            went into exile in consequence of being accused of treachery.</p>
          <p>The Thebans, on gaining the victory, led their whole force <lb/>
            against Lacedæmon, expecting that it would be easy to reduce <lb/>
            the city, as the Spartans were deserted by all their allies. <lb/>
            The Lacedæmonians, dreading the event, sent for their king <lb/>
            Agesilaus out of Asia, where he was performing great exploits, <lb/>
            to defend his country; for since Lysander was slain, they had <lb/>
            no confidence in any other general; but, as he was tardy in <lb/>
            coming, they raised an army, and proceeded to meet the <lb/>
            enemy. Having been once conquered, however, they had <lb/>
            neither spirit nor strength to meet those who had recently <lb/>
            vanquished them. They were accordingly routed in the very <lb/>
            first onset. But Agesilaus came up just when the forces of <lb/>
            his countrymen were overthrown; and, having renewed the <lb/>
            contest, he, with his fresh troops, invigorated by long service, <lb/>
            snatched the victory from the enemy without difficulty, but <lb/>
            was himself severely wounded.</p>
          <p>V. The Athenians, receiving intelligence of this event, <lb/>
            and fearing that if the Lacedæmonians obtained another vic­ <lb/>
            tory, they should be reduced to their former state of bondage, <lb/>
            assembled an army, and ordered that it should be conducted <lb/>
            to the aid of the Bœotians by Iphicrates, a young man <lb/>
            only twenty years of age, but of great abilities. The conduct <lb/>
            of this youth was above his years, and greatly to be admired ; <lb/>
            nor had the Athenians ever before him, among so many and <lb/>
            so great leaders, a captain of greater promise, or of talents <lb/>
            that sooner came to maturity; and he had not only the qua­ <lb/>
            lifications of a general, but also those of an orator.</p>
          <p>CODon, having heard of the return of Agesilaus, came also <lb/>
            himself from Asia to ravage the country of the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians; who, while the terrors of war raged around them, <lb/>
            were shut up within their walls, and reduced to the depths of <lb/>
            despair. After wasting the enemy's territories, CODon prow <lb/>
            ceeded to Athens, where he was received with great joy on <lb/>
            the part of his countrymen; but he felt more sorrow at the <lb/>
            state of his native city, which had been burnt and laid in <lb/>
            ruins by the Lacedæmonians, than joy at his return to it aflei <note type="footnote"> F </note> <pb n="66"/>
            <note type="margin"> B.VI. CH.VII. </note> <lb/>
            so long an absence. He accordingly repaired what had been <lb/>
            burnt, and rebuilt what had been demolished, from the price <lb/>
            of the spoil which he had taken, and with the help of the <lb/>
            Persian troops. Such was the fate of Athens, that having been <lb/>
            first burnt by the Persians, it was restored by their labour; <lb/>
            and having been afterwards wasted by the Lacedæmonians, it <lb/>
            was re-adorned from their spoils; and, the state of things <lb/>
            being reversed, it had now for allies those whom it then had <lb/>
            for enemies, and those for enemies with whom it had been <lb/>
            joined in the closest bonds of alliance.</p>
          <p>VI. During the course of these proceedings, Artaxerxes, <lb/>
            king of the Persians, sent deputies into Greece, with injunc­ <lb/>
            tions, “ that they should all lay down their arms," and as­ <lb/>
            surances " that he would treat as enemies those who should <lb/>
            act otherwise." He restored to the cities their liberty and <lb/>
            all that belonged to them; a course which he did not adopt <lb/>
            from concern for the troubles of the Greeks, and for their <lb/>
            incessant and deadly enmities displayed in the field, but from <lb/>
            unwillingness that, while he was engaged in a war with Egypt <lb/>
            (which he had undertaken because the Egyptians had sent aid <lb/>
            to the Spartans against his satraps), his troops should be <lb/>
            obliged to stay in Greece. The Greeks, exhausted with so <lb/>
            much fighting, eagerly obeyed his mandate.</p>
          <p>This year was not only remarkable for a peace being sud­ <lb/>
            denly made throughout Greece, but for the taking of the city <lb/>
            of Rome at the same time by the Gauls.</p>
          <p>But the Lacedæmonians, watching an opportunity of sur­ <lb/>
            prising the unguarded, and observing that the Arcadians were <lb/>
            absent from their country, stormed one of their fortresses, <lb/>
            and, having taken possession of it, placed a garrison in it. <lb/>
            The Arcadians in consequence, arming and equipping a body <lb/>
            of troops, and calling the Thebans to their assistance, de­ <lb/>
            manded in open war the restitution of what they had lost. In <lb/>
            the battle which followed, Archidamus, general of the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians, was wounded, and, seeing his men cut down and <lb/>
            apparently defeated, sent a herald to ask the bodies of the <lb/>
            slain for burial; this being a sign among the Greeks that the <lb/>
            victory is yielded. The Tbebans, satisfied with this acknow­ <lb/>
            ledgment, made the signal for giving quarter.</p>
          <p>VII. After the lapse of a few days, while neither side was <lb/>
            offering any hostility, and while, as the Lacedæmonians were <pb n="67"/>
            <note type="margin"> B.C. 362. </note> <lb/>
            engaged in other contentions with their neighbours, a truce <lb/>
            was observed as it were by tacit consent, the Thebans, under <lb/>
            the leadership of Epaminondas, conceived hopes of seizing the <lb/>
            city of Sparta. They accordingly proceeded thither secretly, <lb/>
            in the early part of the night, but failed to take the inhabitants <lb/>
            by surprise; for the old men, and others of an age unfit for war, <lb/>
            observing the approach of the enemy, met them in arms at the <lb/>
            very entrance of the gates; and not more than a hundred men, <lb/>
            enfeebled with years, offered battle to fifteen thousand. So <lb/>
            much spirit and vigour does the sight of our country and homes <lb/>
            inspire; and so much more confidence is afforded by the <lb/>
            presence, than by the remembrance of them; for when they <lb/>
            considered where and for what they took their stand, they <lb/>
            resolved either to conquer or die. A few old men, in <lb/>
            consequence, held out against an army, which, shortly before, <lb/>
            the flower of their troops were unable to withstand. In this <lb/>
            battle two generals of the enemy were killed, when, on <lb/>
            intelligence being received that Agesilaus was approaching, the <lb/>
            Thebans retreated. But there was no long cessation of <lb/>
            hostilities; for the Spartan youth, incited by the heroism and <lb/>
            glorious deeds of the old men, could not be prevented from <lb/>
            promptly engaging in the field. Just as victory inclined to the <lb/>
            Thebans, Epaminondas, while he was discharging the duty, <lb/>
            not only of a general, but of a gallant soldier, was severely <lb/>
            wounded. When this was known, fear fell upon one side from <lb/>
            deep concern, and amaze on the other from excess of joy; and <lb/>
            both parties, as if by mutual agreement, retired from the field.</p>
          <p>VIII. A few days after, Epaminondas died, and with him <lb/>
            fell the spirit of the Theban state. For as, when you break <lb/>
            off the point of a dart, you take from the rest of the steel the <lb/>
            power of wounding, so when that general of the Thebans (who <lb/>
            was, as it were, the point of their weapon*) was taken off, the <lb/>
            strength of their government was so debilitated, that they <lb/>
            seemed not so much to have lost him as to have all died with <lb/>
            him. They neither carried on any memorable war before he <lb/>
            became their leader, nor were they afterwards remarkable for <lb/>
            their successes, but for their defeats; so that it is certain that <lb/>
            with him the glory of his country both rose and fell. <lb/>
            Whether he was more estimable as a man or a general is <lb/>
            undecided; for he never sought power for himself, but for his <note type="footnote"> * Velut mucrone teli.] Faber and Lemaire think these words spurious </note> <note type="footnote"> F a </note> <pb n="68"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.VI. CH.IX. </note> <lb/>
            country, and was so far from coveting money, that he did not <lb/>
            leave sufficient to pay for his funeral. Nor was he more <lb/>
            desirous of distinction than of wealth ; for all the appointments <lb/>
            that he held were conferred on him against his will, and he <lb/>
            filled his posts in such a manner that he seemed to add lustre <lb/>
            to his honours rather than to receive it from them. His <lb/>
            application to learning, and his knowledge of philosophy, were <lb/>
            such, that it seemed wonderful how a man bred up in <lb/>
            literature could have so excellent a knowledge of war. The <lb/>
            manner of his death, too, was not at variance with his course of <lb/>
            life; for when he was carried back half dead into the camp, <lb/>
            and had recovered his breath and voice, he asked only this <lb/>
            question of those that stood about him, “ whether the enemy <lb/>
            had taken his shield from him when he fell ? " Hearing that it <lb/>
            was saved, he kissed it, when it was brought to him, as the <lb/>
            sharer of his toils and glory. He afterwards inquired which <lb/>
            side had gained the victory, and hearing that the Thebans had <lb/>
            got it, observed, “It is well," and so, as it were congratulating <lb/>
            his country, expired.</p>
          <p>IX. With his death the spirit of the Athenians also declined. <lb/>
            For after he whom they were wont to emulate was gone, they <lb/>
            sank into sloth and effeminacy, and spent the public income, <lb/>
            not, as formerly, upon fleets and armies, but upon festivals, and <lb/>
            the celebration of games; frequenting the theatres for the sake <lb/>
            of eminent actors and poets, visiting the stage oftener than the <lb/>
            camp, and praising men rather for being good versifiers than <lb/>
            good generals.* It was then that the public revenues, from <lb/>
            which soldiers and sailors used to be maintained, were <lb/>
            distributed † among the people of the city. By which means <lb/>
            it came to pass, that during the absence of exertion on the <lb/>
            part of the Greeks, the name of the Macedonians, previously <lb/>
            mean and obscure, rose into notice; and Philip, who had been <lb/>
            kept three years as a hostage at Thebes, and had been imbued <lb/>
            with the virtues of Epaminondas and Pelopidas, imposed the <lb/>
            power of Macedonia, like a yoke of bondage, upon the necks of <lb/>
            Greece and Asia. <note type="footnote"> * Versificatoresque meliores, quàm duces laudantes.] An obscure mode <lb/>

          <p>I. MACEDONIA was formerly called Emathia, from the name <lb/>
            of king Emathion, of whose prowess the earliest proofs are <lb/>
            extant in those parts. As the origin of this kingdom was but <lb/>
            humble, so its limits were at first extremely narrow. The <lb/>
            inhabitants were called Pelasgi,* the country Pæonia. But <lb/>
            in process of time, when, through the ability of their princes <lb/>
            and the exertions of their subjects, they had conquered, first <lb/>
            of all, the neighbouring tribes, and afterwards other nations <lb/>
            and peoples, their dominions extended to the utmost bounds­ <lb/>
            lies of the east.t In the region of Pæonia, which is now <lb/>
            a portion of Macedonia, is said to have reigned Pelegonus,‡ <lb/>
            the father of Asteropæus, whose name we find, in the Trojan <lb/>
            war, among the most distinguished defenders of the city. On <lb/>
            the other side a king named Europus held the sovereignty in <lb/>
            a district called Europa.§</p>
          <p>But Caranus,|| accompanied by a great multitude of Greeks, <lb/>
            having been directed by an oracle to seek a settlement in <lb/>
            Macedonia, and having come into Emathia, and followed <lb/>
            a flock of goats that were fleeing from a tempest, pos­ <lb/>
            sessed himself of the city of Edessa, before the inhabitants, <lb/>
            on account of the thickness of the rain and mist, were aware <lb/>
            of his approach ; and being reminded of the oracle, by which <lb/>
            he had been ordered “ to seek a kingdom with goats for his <lb/>
            guides," he made this city the seat of his government, and <note type="footnote"> * See Herod. i. 56; Muller's Dorians, voL i. Append. i.; Dr. Smith's <lb/>

            afterwards religiously took care, whithersoever he led his <lb/>

            might have those animals as leaders in his enterprises <lb/>
            which he had had as guides to the site of his kingdom. <lb/>
            He changed the name of the city, in commemoration of his <lb/>
            good fortune, from Edessa to Ægeæ,* and called the inhabitants <lb/>
            Ægeatæ. Having subsequently expelled Midas f (for he also <lb/>
            occupied a part of Macedonia), and driven other kings from their <lb/>
            territories, he established himself, as sole monarch, in the place <lb/>
            of them all, and was the first that, by uniting tribes of different <lb/>
            people, formed Macedonia as it were into one body, and laid a <lb/>
            solid foundation for the extension of his growing kingdom.</p>
          <p>II. After him reigned Perdiocas, whose life was distin­ <lb/>
            guished, and the circumstances of whose death, as if ordered <lb/>
            by an oracle, were worthy of record ; for when he was old and <lb/>
            at the point of death, he made known to his son Argæus a <lb/>
            place in which he wished to be buried, and directed that not <lb/>
            only his own bones, but those of the kings that should succeed <lb/>
            him, should be deposited in the same spot; signifying that, <lb/>
            “ as long as the relics of his posterity should be buried there, <lb/>
            the crown would remain in his family;" and the people <lb/>
            believe, in consequence of this superstitious notion, that the <lb/>
            line came to be extinct in Alexander, because he changed the <lb/>
            place of sepulture. Argæus, having governed the kingdom <lb/>
            with moderation, and gained the love of his subjects, left his <lb/>
            son Philip his successor, who, being carried off by an untimely <lb/>
            death, made Æropus, then quite a boy, his heir.</p>
          <p>The Macedonians had perpetual contests with the Thracians <lb/>
            and Illyrians, and, being hardened by their arms, as it were <lb/>
            by daily exercise, they struck terror into their neighbours by the <lb/>
            splendour of their reputation for war. The Illyrians, however, <lb/>
            despising the boyhood of a king under age, attacked the Mace­ <lb/>
            donians. who, being worsted in the field, brought out their king <lb/>
            with them in his cradle, and, placing him behind the front <lb/>
            lines, renewed the fight with greater vigour, as if they had <lb/>
            been defeated before, because the fortune of their prince <note type="footnote"> * Sometimes written Ægæ, or in the singular Ægea or AEgæa, <lb/>

            was not with them in the battle, and would now certainly <lb/>
            conquer, because, from this superstitious fancy, they had con <lb/>
            ceived a confidence of victory; while compassion for the infant, <lb/>
            also, moved them, as, if they were overcome, they seemed likely <lb/>
            to transform him from a king into a captive. Engaging in battle, <lb/>
            therefore, they routed the Illyrians with great slaughter, and <lb/>
            showed their enemies, that, in the former encounter, it was <lb/>
            a king, and not valour, that was wanting to the Macedonians.</p>
          <p>To Æropus succeeded Amyntas, a prince eminently distill. <lb/>
            guished, both for his own personal valour, and for the excellent <lb/>
            abilities of his son Alexander, who had from nature such <lb/>
            remarkable talents of every kind,. that he contended for the <lb/>
            prize in various species of exercises at the Olympic games.</p>
          <p>III. About this time Darius king of Persia, having been <lb/>
            forced to quit Scythia in dishonourable flight, but not wishing <lb/>
            to be thought every where contemptible from losses in war, <lb/>
            despatched Megabazus, with a portion of his army, to subdue <lb/>
            Thrace, and other kingdoms in those parts; to which <lb/>
            Macedonia, he thought, would fall as an unimportant addition. <lb/>
            Megabazus, speedily executing the king's orders, and sending <lb/>
            deputies to Amyntas king of Macedonia, demanded that <lb/>
            hostages should be given him as a pledge of future peace. <lb/>
            The deputies, being liberally entertained, asked Amyntas, as <lb/>
            their intoxication increased in the progress of a banquet, <lb/>
            ,, to add to the magnificence of his board the privileges of <lb/>
            friendship, by sending for his and his sons' wives to the <lb/>
            feast; a practice which is deemed, among the Persians, a <lb/>
            pledge and bond of hospitality." The women having entered, <lb/>
            and the Persians laying hands upon them too freely, Alexander, <lb/>
            the son of Amyntas, begged his father, from regard to his age <lb/>
            and dignity, to leave the banqueting-room, engaging that he <lb/>
            himself would moderate the frolicsome spirit of their guests. <lb/>
            Amyntas having withdrawn, Alexander called the women <lb/>
            from the apartment for a while, under pretext of having them <lb/>
            dressed in better style, and bringing them back with greater <lb/>
            attractions. But in their place he put young men, clad in <lb/>
            the habit of matrons, and ordered them to chastise the <lb/>
            insolence of the deputies with swords which they were to <lb/>
            carry under their garments. All of them being thus put to <lb/>
            death, Megabazus, not knowing what had happened, but finding <note type="footnote"> * Tanta omnium virtutum ornamenta. </note> <pb n="72"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.VII. CH.V </note> <lb/>
            that the deputies did not return, sent Bubares to Macedonia <lb/>
            with a detachment of his forces, as to an easy and trifling <lb/>
            contest; disdaining to go himself, that he might not be dis­ <lb/>
            graced by an encounter with so despicable a people. But <lb/>
            Bubares, before he came to an engagement, fell in love with <lb/>
            the daughter of Amyntas, when, breaking off hostilities, he <lb/>
            celebrated a marriage, and, all thoughts of war being aban­ <lb/>
            doned, entered into bonds of affinity with the king</p>
          <p>IV. Soon after the departure of Bubares from Macedonia, <lb/>
            king Amyntas died ; but his relationship with Bubares not only <lb/>
            secured to his son and successor, Alexander, peace during the <lb/>
            reign of Darius, but also such favour with Xerxes, that, when <lb/>
            that monarch overspread Greece like a tempest, he conferred <lb/>
            upon him the sovereignty of all the country between the <lb/>
            mountains of Olympus and Hæmus. But Alexander enlarged <lb/>
            his dominions not less by his own valour than through the <lb/>
            munificence of the Persians. The throne afterwards descended, <lb/>
            by the order of succession, to Amyntas, the son of his brother <lb/>
            Menelaus. This prince was remarkable for his application to <lb/>
            business, and was endowed with all the accomplishments of a <lb/>
            great general. By his wife Eurydice he had three sons, Alex­ <lb/>
            ander, Perdiccas, and Philip, the father of Alexander the Great, <lb/>
            and one daughter, named Eurynoe; he had also by Gygæa <lb/>
            Archelaus, Aridæus, and Menelaus. Subsequently he had for­ <lb/>
            midable contests with the Illyrians and Olynthians. He would <lb/>
            have been cut off by a plot of his wife Eurydice, who, having <lb/>
            engaged to marry her son-in-law, had undertaken to kill her <lb/>
            husband, and to put the government into the hands of her <lb/>
            paramour, had not her daughter betrayed the intrigue and <lb/>
            atrocious intentions of her mother. Having escaped so many <lb/>
            dangers, he died at an advanced age, leaving the throne to <lb/>
            Alexander, the eldest of his sons.</p>
          <p>V, Alexander, at the very beginning of his reign, purchased <lb/>
            peace from the Illyrians with a sum of money, giving his <lb/>
            brother Philip to them as a hostage. Some time after, too, <lb/>
            he made peace with the Thebans by giving the same hostage; <lb/>
            a circumstance which afforded Philip fine opportunities of <lb/>
            improving his extraordinary abilities; for, being kept as a <lb/>
            hostage at Thebes three years, he received the first rudiments <lb/>
            of education * in a city distinguished for strictness of disci. <note type="footnote"> * Prima <unclear>puerJicc</unclear> rudiment adeposuit.] He went through of (expe. </note> <pb n="73"/>

            pline, and in the house of Epaminondas, an eminent philoso­ <lb/>
            pher, as well as commander. Not long afterwards Alexander <lb/>
            fell by a plot of his mother Eurydice, whom Amyntas, when <lb/>
            she was convicted of a conspiracy against him, had spared for <lb/>
            the sake of their children, little imagining that she would one <lb/>
            day be the destroyer of them. Perdiccas, also, the brother of <lb/>
            Alexander, was taken off by similar treachery. Horrible, <lb/>
            indeed, was it, that children should have been deprived of life <lb/>
            by a mother, to gratify her lust, whom a regard for those very <lb/>
            children had saved from the punishment of her crimes. The <lb/>
            murder of Perdiccas seemed the more atrocious from the cir­ <lb/>
            cumstance that not even the prayers of his little son could <lb/>
            procure him pity from his mother. Philip, for a long time, <lb/>
            acted, not as king, but as guardian to this infant; but, when <lb/>
            dangerous wars threatened, and it was too long to wait for the <lb/>
            co-operation of a prince who was yet a child, he was forced by <lb/>
            the people to take the government upon himself.</p>
          <p>VI. When he took possession of the throne, great hopes <lb/>
            were formed of him by all, both on account of his abilities, <lb/>
            which promised that he would prove a great man, and on <lb/>
            account of certain old oracles respecting Macedonia, which <lb/>
            had foretold that " when one of the sons of Amyntas should <lb/>
            be king, the state of the country would be extremely flourish­ <lb/>
            ing: " to fulfil which expectations the wickedness of his mother <lb/>
            had left only him. At the commencement of his reign, when, <lb/>
            on the one hand, the murder of his brother, so atrociously put <lb/>
            to death, and the dread of treachery; on the other, a multitude <lb/>
            of enemies, and the poverty of his kingdom, exhausted by a <lb/>
            series of wars, bore hard upon the young king's immature age, <lb/>
            thinking it proper to make distinct arrangements as to the <lb/>
            wars, which, as if by a common conspiracy to crush Macedonia, <lb/>
            rose around him from different nations and several quarters at <lb/>
            the same time, to all of which he could not at once make <lb/>
            resistance, he put an end to some by offers of peace, and <lb/>
            bought off others, but attacked such of his enemies as seemed <lb/>
            easiest to be subdued, that, by a victory over them, he might <lb/>
            confirm the wavering minds of his soldiers, and alter any <lb/>

            aim. His first conflict was with the Athenians,* whom he <lb/>
            surprised by a stratagem, but, though he might have put them <lb/>
            all to the sword, he yet, from dread of a more formidable war, <lb/>
            allowed them to depart uninjured and without ransom. After <lb/>
            wards, leading his army against the Illyrians, he killed several <lb/>
            thousand of his enemies, and took the famous city of Larissa. <lb/>
            He then fell suddenly on Thessaly (when it apprehended any <lb/>
            thing rather than war), not from desire of spoil, but because <lb/>
            he wished to add the strength of the Thessalian cavalry to his <lb/>
            own troops; and he thus incorporated a force of horse and <lb/>
            foot in one invincible army. His undertakings having been <lb/>
            thus far successful, he married Olympias, daughter of Neop­ <lb/>
            tolemus, afterwards king of the Molossians, her cousin-german <lb/>
            Arrybas, then king of that nation, who had brought up the <lb/>
            young princess, and had married her sister Troas, promoting <lb/>
            the union; a proceeding which proved the cause of his ruin, <lb/>
            and the beginning of all the evils that afterwards betel him; <lb/>
            for while he hoped to strengthen his kingdom by this affinity <lb/>
            with Philip, he was by that monarch deprived of his crown, <lb/>
            and spent his old age in exile.</p>
          <p>After these proceedings, Philip, no longer satisfied with <lb/>
            acting on the defensive, boldly attacked even those who gave <lb/>
            him no molestation. While he was besieging Methone, an <lb/>
            arrow, shot from the walls at him as he was passing by, struck <lb/>
            out his right eye ; but by this wound he was neither rendered <lb/>
            less active in the siege, nor more resentful towards the enemy; <lb/>
            so that, some days after, he granted them peace on their appli­ <lb/>
            cation for it, and was not only not severe, but even merciful, <lb/>
            to the conquered. <note type="footnote"> * Who had sent a fleet to Macedonia under Manteias, with the <lb/>

          <p>I. THE states of Greece, while each sought to gain the <lb/>
            sovereignty of the country for itself, lost it as a body. <lb/>
            Striving intemperately to ruin one another, they did not per­ <lb/>
            ceive, till they were oppressed by another power, that what <lb/>
            each lost was a common loss to all; for Philip, king of Mace­ <lb/>
            donia, looking, as from a watch-tower, for an opportunity to <lb/>
            attack their liberties, and fomenting their contentions by <lb/>
            assisting the weaker, obliged victors and vanquished alike to <lb/>
            submit to his royal yoke. The Thebans were the cause and <lb/>
            origin of this calamity, who, obtaining power, and having no <lb/>
            steadiness of mind to bear prosperity, insolently accused the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians and Phocians, when they had conquered them <lb/>
            in the field, before the common council of Greece,. as if they <lb/>
            had not been sufficiently punished by the slaughters and <lb/>
            depredations that they had suffered. It was laid to the charge <lb/>
            of the Lacedæmonians, that they had seized the citadel of <lb/>
            Thebes during a time of truce, and to that of the Phocians, <lb/>
            that they had laid waste Bœotia, as if the Thebans themselves, <lb/>
            after their conduct in the field, had left themselves any ground <lb/>
            for resorting to law. But as the cause was conducted accord­ <lb/>
            ing to the will of the more powerful, the Phocians were sen­ <lb/>
            tenced to pay such a fine as it was impossible for them to <lb/>
            raise, and in consequence, despoiled of their lands, children, <lb/>
            and wives, and reduced to desperation, they seized, under the <lb/>
            leadership of one Philomelus, on the temple of Apollo at <lb/>
            Delphi, as if they were enraged at the god. Being hence <lb/>
            enriched with gold and treasure, and hiring mercenary troops, <lb/>
            they made war upon the Thebans. This proceeding of the <lb/>
            Phocians, though all expressed detestation at the sacrilege, <lb/>
            brought more odium upon the Thebans, by whom they had <lb/>
            been reduced to such necessity, than on the Phocians them­ <note type="footnote"> • The Amphictyonic council. </note> <pb n="76"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.VIII. CH.II. </note> <lb/>
            selves; and aid was in consequence despatched to them both <lb/>
            by the Athenians and Lacedæmonians. In the first engage­ <lb/>
            ment, Philomelus drove the Thebans from their camp; but <lb/>
            in the next he was killed, fighting in front among the thickest <lb/>
            of the enemy, and paid the penalty of his sacrilege by the <lb/>
            effusion of his impious blood. Onomarchus was made general <lb/>
            in his stead.</p>
          <p>II. To oppose Onomarchus, the Thebans and Thessalians <lb/>
            chose as general, not one of their own people, lest they should <lb/>
            not be able to endure his rule if he should conquer, but <lb/>
            Philip, king of Macedonia, voluntarily submitting to that power <lb/>
            from a foreigner which they dreaded in the hands of their own <lb/>
            countrymen. Philip, as if he were the avenger of the sacri­ <lb/>
            lege, not the defender of the Thebans, ordered all his soldiers <lb/>
            to assume crowns of laurel, and proceeded to battle as if under <lb/>
            the leadership of the god. The Phocians, seeing these en­ <lb/>
            signs of the deity, and frighted with the consciousness of <lb/>
            guilt, threw down their arms and fled, receiving punishment <lb/>
            for their violation of religion by the bloodshed and slaughter <lb/>
            that they suffered. This affair brought incredibly great <lb/>
            glory to Philip in the opinion of all people, who called him <lb/>
            " the avenger of the god, and the defender of religion," and <lb/>
            said that " he alone had arisen to require satisfaction for what <lb/>
            ought to have been punished by the combined force of the <lb/>
            world, and was consequently worthy to be ranked next to the <lb/>
            gods, as by him the majesty of the gods had been vindicated."</p>
          <p>The Athenians, hearing the result of the conflict, and <lb/>
            fearing that Philip would march into Greece, took possession <lb/>
            of the straits of Thermopylae, as they had done on the invasion <lb/>
            of the Persians, but by no means with like spirit, or in a <lb/>
            similar cause ; for then they fought in behalf of the liberty of <lb/>
            Greece, now, in behalf of public sacrilege;- then to defend the <lb/>
            temples of the gods from the ravages of an enemy, now, to <lb/>
            defend the plunderers of temples against the avengers of their <lb/>
            guilt, acting as advocates of a crime of which it was dishonour <lb/>
            able to them that others should have been the punishers, and <lb/>
            utterly unmindful that, in their dangers, they had often had <lb/>
            recourse to this deity as a counsellor; that, under his guidance, <note type="footnote"> * Pro sacrilegio publico.] This is not just. The Athenians did not <lb/>
            fight in defence of sacrilege, but merely took the side of the Phociaus <lb/>

            they had entered on so many wars with success, had founded <lb/>
            so many cities auspiciously, and had acquired so extensive a <lb/>
            dominion by sea and land : and that they had never done any <lb/>
            thing, either of a public or private nature, without the sanction <lb/>
            of his authority. Strange that a people of such ability, im­ <lb/>
            proved by every kind of learning, and formed by the most <lb/>
            excellent laws and institutions, should have brought such guilt <lb/>
            upon themselves as to leave nothing with which they could <lb/>
            afterwards justly upbraid barbarians.</p>
          <p>III. Nor did Philip distinguish himself by more honourable <lb/>
            conduct towards his allies; for, as if he was afraid of being <lb/>
            surpassed by his opponents in the guilt of sacrilege, he seized <lb/>
            and plundered, like an enemy, cities of which he had just <lb/>
            before been captain, which had fought under his auspices, and <lb/>
            which had congratulated him and themselves on their victories; <lb/>
            he sold the wives and children of the inhabitants for slaves; <lb/>
            he spared neither the temples of the gods, nor other sacred <lb/>

          <p>In the next place, as if he had done every thing well, be <lb/>

            equal perfidy, and treacherously capturing or killing the <lb/>
            neighbouring princes, he united the whole of the province to <lb/>
            the kingdom of Macedonia. Afterwards, to throw a veil <lb/>
            over his character for dishonesty, for which he was now <lb/>
            deemed remarkable above other men, he sent persons through <lb/>
            the kingdoms and the richest of the cities, to spread a report <lb/>
            that king Philip was ready to contract, at a vast sum, for the <lb/>
            re-building of the walls, temples, and sacred edifices, in the <lb/>
            several towns, and to invite contractors by public criers; but <lb/>
            when those who were willing to undertake these works went to <lb/>
            Macedonia, they found themselves put off with various excuses, <lb/>
            and, from dread of the king's power, returned quietly to their <note type="footnote"> * Wetzel retains Cappadociam, the old reading, in his text, though <lb/>

            homos. Soon after he fell upon the Olynthians, because, after <lb/>
            the death of one of his brothers, they had, from pity, afforded <lb/>
            a refuge to two others, whom, being the sons of his step-mother, <lb/>
            Philip would gladly have cut off, as pretenders to a share in <lb/>
            the throne. For this reason he destroyed an ancient and noble <lb/>
            city, consigning his brothers to the death long before destined <lb/>
            for them, and delighting himself at the same time with a vast <lb/>
            quantity of booty, and the gratification of his fratricidal <lb/>
            inclinations. Next, as if every thing that he meditated was <lb/>
            lawful for him to do, he seized upon the gold mines in Thes­ <lb/>
            saly, and the silver ones in Thrace, and, to leave no law or <lb/>
            right unviolated, proceeded to engage in piracy. While <lb/>
            such was his conduct, it happened that two brothers, princes <lb/>
            of Thrace, chose him as arbitrator in their disputes, not, indeed, <lb/>
            from respect for his justice, but because each dreaded that he <lb/>
            would unite his strength to that of the other. Philip, in <lb/>
            accordance with his practice and disposition, came unexpectedly <lb/>
            upon the brothers with an army in full array, not apparently <lb/>
            to try a cause, but to fight a battle, and spoiled them both of <lb/>
            their dominions, not like a judge, but with the perfidy and <lb/>
            baseness of a robber.</p>
          <p>IV. During the course of these transactions, ambassadors <lb/>
            came to him from the Athenians to ask for peace. Having <lb/>
            listened to their request, he despatched ambassadors to Athens <lb/>
            with terms, and a peace was concluded there to the advan <lb/>
            tage of both parties. Embassies came to him also from other <lb/>
            states of Greece, not from inclination for peace, but for fear of <lb/>
            war; for the Thessalians and Boeotiam, with reviving wrath, <lb/>
            entreated that he would prove himself the leader of Greece, as <lb/>
            be had professed to be, against the Phocians; such being the <lb/>
            hatred with which they were inflamed towards that people, <lb/>
            that they chose rather to perish themselves, than not to <lb/>
            destroy them, and to submit to the known cruelty of Philip, <lb/>
            rather than spare their enemies. On the other hand, ambas­ <lb/>
            sadors from the Phocians (the Lacedæmonians and Athenians <lb/>
            joining with them) endeavoured to avert the war, forbearance <lb/>
            from which they had thrice before purchased from Philip. It <lb/>
            was a shameful and miserable sight, to behold Greece, even <lb/>
            then the most distinguished country in the world for power <lb/>
            and dignity, a country that had constantly been the conqueror <lb/>
            of kings and nations, and was still mistress of many cities, <pb n="79"/>

            waiting at a foreign court to ask or deprecate war; that the <lb/>
            champions of the world should place all their hopes on assist­ <lb/>
            ance from another, and should be reduced, by their discords <lb/>
            and civil feuds, to such a condition as to flatter a power which <lb/>
            had lately been a humble portion of their dependencies; and <lb/>
            that the Thebans and Lacedæmonians should especially do <lb/>
            this, who were formerly rivals for sovereignty, but now for the <lb/>
            favour of a sovereign. Philip, to show his importance, <lb/>
            assumed an air of disdain for these great cities, and delibe­ <lb/>
            rated to which of the two he should vouchsafe his favour. <lb/>
            Having heard both embassies privately, he promised to the <lb/>
            one security from war, binding them by an oath to reveal his <lb/>
            answer to nobody; to the other he engaged himself to come and <lb/>
            bring them assistance. He charged them both neither to pre­ <lb/>
            pare for war, nor to fear it. Different replies being thus given <lb/>
            to each, he seized, while they were all free from apprehension, <lb/>
            on the pass of Thermopylae.</p>
          <p>V. The Phocians in consequence, finding themselves over­ <lb/>
            reached by the cunning of Philip, were the first, in great <lb/>
            trepidation, to take arms. But there was no time to make due <lb/>
            preparation for war, or to collect auxiliaries, and Philip, unless <lb/>
            a surrender should be made, threatened their destruction. <lb/>
            Overcome, accordingly, by necessity, they submitted, stipulat­ <lb/>
            ing only for their lives. But this stipulation was just as faith­ <lb/>
            fully observed by Philip as his promises had been respecting <lb/>
            the war which they had deprecated. They were every where <lb/>
            put to the sword, or made prisoners; children were not left to <lb/>
            their parents, nor wives to their husbands, nor the statues of <lb/>
            the gods in the temples. The sole comfort of the wretched <lb/>
            people was, that as Philip had defrauded his allies of their <lb/>
            share of the spoil, they saw none of their property in the hands <lb/>
            of their enemies.</p>
          <p>On his return to his kingdom, as shepherds drive their <lb/>
            flocks sometimes into winter, sometimes into summer pastures, <lb/>
            so he transplanted people and cities hither and thither, accord­ <lb/>
            ing to his caprice, as places appeared to him proper to be <lb/>
            peopled or left desolate. The aspect of things was every where <lb/>
            wretched, like that of a country ravaged by an enemy. There <lb/>
            was not, indeed, that terror of a foe, or hurrying of troops <lb/>
            through the cities, or seizure of property and prisoners, which <lb/>
            are seen during a hostile invasion; but there prevailed a sorrow <pb n="80"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.VIII. CH.VI. </note> <lb/>
            and sadness not expressed in words, the people fearing that <lb/>
            even their very tears would be thought signs of discontent <lb/>
            Their grief was augmented by the very concealment of it, sink­ <lb/>
            ing the deeper the less they were permitted to utter it. At one <lb/>
            time they contemplated the sepulchres of their ancestors, at <lb/>
            another their old household gods, at another the homes <lb/>
            in which they had been born, and in which they had had fami­ <lb/>
            lies : lamenting sometimes their own fate, that they had lived <lb/>
            to that day, and sometimes that of their children, that they <lb/>
            ere not born after it.</p>
          <p>VI. Some people he planted upon the frontiers of his king­ <lb/>
            dom to oppose his enemies; others he settled at the extremities <lb/>
            of it. Some, whom he had taken prisoners in war, he distri­ <lb/>
            buted among certain cities to fill up the number of inhabitants; <lb/>
            and thus, out of various tribes and nations, he formed one <lb/>
            kingdom and people. When he had settled and put in order <lb/>
            the affairs of Macedonia, he reduced the Dardanians and others <lb/>
            of his neighbours, who were overreached by his treacherous deal­ <lb/>
            ings. Nor did he keep his hands even from his own relations; <lb/>
            for he resolved on expelling Arrybas, king of Epirus, who was <lb/>
            nearly related to his wife Olympias, out of his kingdom; and <lb/>
            he invited Alexander, a step-son of Arrybas, and brother of his <lb/>
            wife Olympias (a youth of remarkable beauty), into Macedonia, <lb/>
            in his sisters name, and engaged him, after earnestly tempting <lb/>
            him with hopes of his father's throne, and pretending violent <lb/>
            love for him, in a criminal intercourse, thinking to find greater <lb/>
            submission from him, whether through shame on account of his <lb/>
            guilt, or through obligation for a kingdom conferred upon him. <lb/>
            When he was twenty years of age, accordingly, he took the <lb/>
            kingdom from Arrybas, and gave it to the youth, acting a base <lb/>
            part towards both, for he disregarded the claims of consan­ <lb/>
            guinity in him from whom he took the kingdom, and corrupted <lb/>
            him to whom he gave it before he made him a king.</p><pb n="81"/>

          <p>I. WHEN Philip had once come into Greece, allured <lb/>
            by the plunder of a few cities, and had formed an opinion, <lb/>
            from the spoil of such towns as were of less note, how <lb/>
            great must be the riches of all its cities put together, he <lb/>
            resolved to make war upon the whole of Greece. Thinking <lb/>
            that it would greatly conduce to the promotion of his design, if <lb/>
            he could get possession of Byzantium, a noble city and sea­ <lb/>
            port, which would be a station for his forces by land and sea, <lb/>
            he proceeded, as it shut its gates against him, to lay close siege <lb/>
            to it. This city had been founded by Pausanias, king of <lb/>
            Sparta, and held by him for seven years, but afterwards, as <lb/>
            the fortune of war varied, it was regarded as at one time <lb/>
            belonging to the Athenians, and at another to the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians; and this uncertainty of possession was the <lb/>
            cause that, while neither party supported it as its own, it <lb/>
            maintained its liberty with the greater determination. Philip, <lb/>
            exhausted by the length of the siege, had recourse to piracy <lb/>
            for a supply of money, and having captured a hundred and <lb/>
            seventy ships, and sold off the cargoes, he was enabled for a <lb/>
            while to relieve his craving wants. But that so great an army <lb/>
            might not be wasted in the siege of a single city, he marched <lb/>
            away with his best troops, and stormed some towns of the <lb/>
            Chersonese. He also sent for his son Alexander, who was then <lb/>
            eighteen years of age, to join him, and learn the rudiments of <lb/>
            war in the camp of his father. He made an expedition, too, <lb/>
            into Scythia, to get plunder, that, after the practice of traders, <lb/>
            he might make up for the expenses of one war by the profits of <lb/>
            another.</p>
          <p>II. The king of the Scythians at that time was Atheas, <lb/>
            who, being distressed by a war with the Istrians, sought aid <lb/>
            from Philip through the people of Apollonia, on the under <lb/>
            standing that he would adopt him for his successor on the throne <lb/>
            of Scythia. But in the mean time, the king of the Istrians <lb/>
             <pb n="82"/>
             <note type="margin">[B.IX. CH.II. </note> <lb/>
            died, and relieved the Scythians both from the fear of war <lb/>
            and the want of assistance. Atheas, therefore, sending away <lb/>
            the Macedonians, ordered a message to be sent to Philip, that <lb/>
            " he had neither sought his aid, nor proposed his adoption; * <lb/>
            for the Scythians needed no protection from the Macedonians, <lb/>
            to whom they were superior in the field, nor did he himself <lb/>
            want an heir, as he had a son living." When Philip heard <lb/>
            this, he sent ambassadors to Atheas to ask him to defray at <lb/>
            least a portion of the expense of the siege, t that he might not <lb/>
            be forced to raise it for want of money; "a request," he said,</p>
          <p>" with which he ought the more readily to comply, as, when <lb/>
            he sent soldiers to his assistance, he had not even paid their <lb/>
            expenses on the march, to say nothing of remuneration for <lb/>
            their service." Atheas, alluding to the rigour of their <lb/>
            climate and the barrenness of their soil, which, far from 1 <lb/>
            enriching the Scythians with wealth, scarcely afforded them <lb/>
            sustenance, replied, that "he had no treasury to satisfy so <lb/>
            great a king, and that he thought it less honourable to do <lb/>
            little than to refuse altogether; but that the Scythians were to <lb/>
            be estimated by their valour and hardiness of body, not by <lb/>
            their possessions." Philip, mocked by this message, broke up <lb/>
            the siege of Byzantium, and entered upon a war with the <lb/>
            Scythians, first sending ambassadors to lull them into security, <lb/>
            by telling Atheas that " while he was besieging Byzantium, he <lb/>
            had vowed a statue to Hercules, which he was going to erect <lb/>
            at the mouth of the Ister, requesting an unobstructed passage <lb/>
            to pay his vow to the god, since he was coming as a friend to <lb/>
            the Scythians." Atheas desired him, " if his object was <lb/>
            merely to fulfil his vow, to let the statue be sent to him," pro­ <lb/>
            mising that " it should not only be erected, but should remain <lb/>
            uninjured." but refusing " to allow an army to enter his ter <lb/>
            ritories," and adding that, "if he should set up the statue in <lb/>
            spite of the Scythians, he would take it down when he was <lb/>
            gone, and turn the brass of it into heads for arrows." With <lb/>
            feelings thus irritated on both sides, a battle was fought. <lb/>
            Though the Scythians were superior in courage and numbers, <lb/>
            they were defeated by the subtlety of Philip. Twenty thou­ <note type="footnote"> * Meaning that he had given no sucn commission to the people of <lb/>

            sand young men and women were taken, and a vast number of <lb/>
            cattle, but no gold or silver. This was the first proof which <lb/>
            they had of the poverty of Scythia. Twenty thousand fine <lb/>
            mares were sent into Macedonia to raise a breed.</p>
          <p>III. But as Philip was returning from Scythia, the Triballi <lb/>
            met him, and refused to allow him a passage, unless they <lb/>
            received a share of the spoil. Hence arose a dispute, and <lb/>
            afterwards a battle, in which Philip received so severe a wound <lb/>
            through the thigh, that his horse was killed by it; and while <lb/>
            it was generally supposed that he was dead, the booty was lost. <lb/>
            Thus the Scythian spoil, as if attended with a curse, had <lb/>
            almost proved fatal to the Macedonians.</p>
          <p>But as soon as he recovered from his wound, he made war <lb/>
            upon the Athenians, of which he had long dissembled his <lb/>
            intention. The Thebans espoused their cause, fearing that if <lb/>
            the Athenians were conquered, the war, like a fire in the <lb/>
            neighbourhood, would spread to them. An alliance being <lb/>
            accordingly made between the two cities, which were just <lb/>
            before * at violent enmity with each other, they wearied Greece <lb/>
            with embassies, stating that " they thought the common <lb/>
            enemy should be repelled by their common strength, for that <lb/>
            Philip would not rest, if his first attempts succeeded, until he <lb/>
            had subjugated all Greece." Some of the cities were moved <lb/>
            by these arguments, and joined themselves to the Athenians; <lb/>
            but the dread of a war induced some to go over to Philip. A <lb/>
            battle being brought on,t though the Athenians were far <lb/>
            superior in number of soldiers, they were conquered by the <lb/>
            valour of the Macedonians, which was invigorated by constant <lb/>
            service in the field. They were not, however, in defeat, <lb/>
            unmindful of their ancient valour; for, falling with wounds in <lb/>
            front, they all covered the places which they had been charged <lb/>
            by their leaders to defend, with their dead bodies. This day <lb/>
            put an end to the glorious sovereignty and ancient liberty of <lb/>
            all Greece.</p>
          <p>IV. Philip's joy for this victory was artfully concealed. He <lb/>
            abstained from offering the usual sacrifices ‡ on that day ; he <lb/>
            did not smile at table, or mingle any diversions with the enter­ <note type="footnote"> *Paullo ante.] In the Phocian war. See viii. 1, 8.—Wetzel. </note><note type="footnote"> t At Chæronea in Boeotia, the leaders opposed to Philip being <lb/>

            tainment; he had no chaplets or perfumes; and, as far as was <lb/>
            in his power, he so managed his conquest that none might <lb/>
            think of him as a conqueror. He desired that he should not <lb/>
            be called king, but general of Greece; and conducted himself <lb/>
            with such prudence, between his own secret joy on the one <lb/>
            hand and the grief of the enemy on the other, that he neither <lb/>
            appeared to his own subjects to rejoice, nor to the vanquished <lb/>
            to insult them. To the Athenians, whom he had found to be <lb/>
            his bitterest enemies, he both sent back their prisoners without <lb/>
            ransom, and gave up the bodies of the slain for burial; <lb/>
            exhorting them to convey the relics of their dead to the sepul­ <lb/>
            chres of their ancestors. He also sent Alexander his son <lb/>
            with his friend Antipater to Athens, to establish peace and <lb/>
            friendship with them. The Thebans, however, he compelled <lb/>
            to purchase their prisoners, as well as the liberty of burying <lb/>
            their dead. Some of the chief men of their city, too, he put <lb/>
            to death; others he banished, seizing upon the property of <lb/>
            them all. Afterwards, he reinstated in their country those <lb/>
            that had been unjustly banished, of whom he made three hun­ <lb/>
            dred judges and governors of the city, before whom when the <lb/>
            most eminent citizens were arraigned on this very charge, that <lb/>
            of having banished them unjustly, they had such spirit that <lb/>
            they all acknowledged their participation in the fact, and <lb/>
            affirmed that it was better with the state when they were con­ <lb/>
            demned than when they were restored. A wonderful instance <lb/>
            of courage! They passed sentence, as far as they could, on <lb/>
            those who had the disposal of them for life or death, and set <lb/>
            at nought the pardon which their enemies could give them ; <lb/>
            and, as they could not avenge themselves * by deeds, they <lb/>
            manifested their boldness of spirit by words.</p>
          <p>V. War being at an end in Greece, Philip directed depu­ <lb/>
            ties from all the states to be summoned to Corinth, to settle <lb/>
            the condition of affairs. Here he fixed terms of peace for the <lb/>
            whole of Greece, according to the merits of each city; and <lb/>
            chose from them all a council, to form a senate as it were foi <lb/>
            the country. But the Lacedæmonians, standing alone, showed <note type="footnote"> * Wetzel's text has, et quam rebut nequeunt ulcisci, verbis usurpant <lb/>

            contempt alike for the terms and the king; regarding the <lb/>
            state of things, which had not been agreed upon by the cities <lb/>
            themselves, but forced upon them by a conqueror, as a state, <lb/>
            not of peace, but of slavery. The number of troops to be <lb/>
            furnished by each state was then determined, whether the king, <lb/>
            in case of being attacked, was to be supported by their united <lb/>
            force, or whether war was to be made on any other power <lb/>
            under him as their general. In all these preparations for war <lb/>
            it was not to be doubted that the kingdom of Persia was the <lb/>
            object in view. The sum of the force was two hundred <lb/>
            thousand infantry and fifteen thousand cavalry. Exclusive of <lb/>
            this number there was also the army of Macedonia, and the <lb/>
            adjacent barbarians of the conquered nations.</p>
          <p>In the beginning of the next spring, he sent forward three <lb/>
            of his generals into that part of Asia which was under the <lb/>
            power of the Persians, Parmenio, Amyntas, and Attalus, whose <lb/>
            sister he had recently married, having divorced Olympias, the <lb/>
            mother of Alexander, on suspicion of adultery.</p>
          <p>VI. In the meantime, while the troops were assembling <lb/>
            from Greece, he celebrated the marriage of his daughter Cleo­ <lb/>
            patra with Alexander, whom he had made king of Epirus. <lb/>
            The day was remarkable for the pomp displayed on it, suitable <lb/>
            to the magnificence of the two princes, him that gave his <lb/>
            daughter in marriage, and him that married her. Magnificent <lb/>
            games were also celebrated, and as Philip was going to view <lb/>
            them, unattended by his guards, walking between the two <lb/>
            Alexanders, his son and son-in-law, Pausanias, a noble Mace­ <lb/>
            donian youth, without being suspected by any one, posting <lb/>
            himself in a narrow passage, killed him as he was going <lb/>
            through it, and caused a day appointed for joy to be over­ <lb/>
            clouded with mourning for a death. Pausanias, in the early <lb/>
            part of his youth, had suffered gross violence at the hands of <lb/>
            Attalus, to the indignity of which was added this further <lb/>
            affront, that AttaIns had exposed him, after bringing him to a <lb/>
            banquet and making him drunk, not only to insults from him­ <lb/>
            self, but also to those of the company, as if he had been a <lb/>
            common object for ill-treatment, and rendered him the <lb/>
            laughing-stock of those of his own age. Being impatient <lb/>
            under this ignominy, Pausanias had often made complaints to <lb/>
            Philip, but being put off with various excuses, not unattended <lb/>
            with ridicule, and seeing his adversary also honoured with a <pb n="86"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.IX. CH.VII. </note> <lb/>
            general's commission, he turned his rage against Philip him­ <lb/>
            self, and inflicted on him, as an unjust judge, that revenge <lb/>
            which he could not inflict on him as an adversary.*</p>
          <p>VII. It is even believed that he was instigated to the act <lb/>
            by Olympias, Alexander's mother, and that Alexander himself <lb/>
            was not ignorant that his father was to be killed; as Olympias <lb/>
            had felt no less resentment at her divorce, and the preferment <lb/>
            of Cleopatra to herself, than Pausanias had felt at the insults <lb/>
            which he had received. As for Alexander, it is said that he <lb/>
            feared his brother by his step-mother as a rival for the throne ; <lb/>
            and hence it happened that he had previously quarrelled at a <lb/>
            banquet, first with Attalus, and afterwards with his father him­ <lb/>
            self, insomuch that Philip pursued him even with his drawn <lb/>
            sword, and was hardly prevented from killing him by the entrea­ <lb/>
            ties of his friends. Alexander had in consequence retired with <lb/>
            his mother into Epirus, to take refuge with his uncle, and from <lb/>
            thence to the king of the Illyrians, and was with difficulty <lb/>
            reconciled to his father when he recalled him, and not easily <lb/>
            induced by the prayers of his relations to return. Olympias, <lb/>
            too, was instigating her brother, the king of Epirus, to go to <lb/>
            war with Philip, and would have prevailed upon him to do so, <lb/>
            had not Philip, by giving him his daughter in marriage, dis­ <lb/>
            armed him as a son-in-law. With these provocations to <lb/>
            resentment, both of them are thought to have encouraged <lb/>
            Pausanias, when complaining of his insults being left unpun­ <lb/>
            ished, to so atrocious a deed. Olympias, it is certain, had <lb/>
            horses prepared for the escape of the assassin; and, when she <lb/>
            heard that the king was dead, hastening to the funeral under <lb/>
            the appearance of respect, she put a crown of gold, the same <lb/>
            night that she arrived, on the head of Pausanias,t as he was <lb/>
            hanging on a cross; an act which no one but she would have dared <lb/>
            to do, as long as the son of Philip was alive. A few days after, <lb/>
            she burnt the body of the assassin, when it had been taken down, <lb/>
            upon the remains of her husband, and made him a tomb in the <lb/>
            same place; she also provided that yearly sacrifices should be per­ <lb/>
            formed to his manes, possessing the people with a superstitious <lb/>
            notion for the purpose. Next she forced Cleopatra, for whose <lb/>
            sake she had been divorced from Philip, to hang herself, hav­ <note type="footnote"> * He could not call Philip to account in single combat. </note><note type="footnote"> + He had been apprehended, as he was making his escape, by <lb/>

            ing first killed her daughter in her lap, and enjoyed the sight <lb/>
            of her suffering this vengeance, to which she had hastened by <lb/>
            procuring the death of her husband.. Last of all she conse­ <lb/>
            crated the sword, with which the king. had been killed, to <lb/>
            Apollo, under the name of Myrtale,t which was Olympias's <lb/>
            own name when a child. And all these things were done so <lb/>
            publicly, that she seems to have been afraid lest it should not <lb/>
            be evident enough that the deed was promoted by her.</p>
          <p>VIII. Philip died at the age of forty-seven, after having <lb/>
            reigned twenty-five years. He had, by a dancing girl of <lb/>
            Larissa, a son named Aridæus, who reigned after Alexander. <lb/>
            He had also many others by several wives, ‡as is not unusual <lb/>
            with princes, some of whom died a natural death, and others <lb/>
            by the sword. As a king, he was more inclined to display in <lb/>
            war, than in entertainments; and his greatest riches were <lb/>
            means for military operations. He was better at getting <lb/>
            wealth than keeping it, and, in consequence, was always poor <lb/>
            amidst his daily spoliations. Clemency and perfidy were <lb/>
            equally valued by him; and no road to victory was, in his <lb/>
            opinion, dishonourable. He was equally pleasing and trea­ <lb/>
            cherous in his address, promising more than he could perform. <lb/>
            He was well qualified either for serious conversation or for <lb/>
            jesting. He maintained friendships more with a view to <lb/>
            interest than good faith. It was a common practice with him <lb/>
            to pretend kindness where he hated, and to counterfeit dislike <lb/>
            where he loved; to sow dissension among friends, and try to <lb/>
            gain favour from both sides. With such a disposition, his <lb/>
            eloquence was very great, his language full of point and studied <lb/>
            effect; so that neither did his facility fall short of his art, nor <lb/>
            his invention of his facility, nor his art of his invention.</p>
          <p>To Philip succeeded his son Alexander, a prince greatei <lb/>
            than his father, both in his virtues and his vices. Each of thie. <lb/>
            two had a different mode of conquering; the one prosecute­ <lb/>
            his wars with open force, the other with subtlety; the one de­ <lb/>
            lighted in deceiving his enemies, the other in boldly repulsing <lb/>
            them. The one was more prudent in council, the other mor* <lb/>
            noble in feeling. The father would dissemble his resentment. <note type="footnote"> * Parricidio.] See note on Sail. Cat. c. 14. </note><note type="footnote"> t Sub nomine Myrtales.] Putting an inscription on it, " <unclear>Myrt</unclear> <lb/>

            and often subdue it; when the son was provoked, there was <lb/>
            neither delay nor bounds to his vengeance. They were both <lb/>
            too fond of wine, but the ill effects of their intoxication were <lb/>
            totally different; the father would rush from a banquet to face <lb/>
            the enemy, cope with him, and rashly expose himself to dan­ <lb/>
            gers ; the son vented his rage, not upon his enemies, but his <lb/>
            friends. A battle often sent away Philip wounded; Alexander <lb/>
            often left a banquet* stained with the blood of his companions. <lb/>
            The one wished to reign with his friends, the other to reign <lb/>
            over them. The one preferred to be loved, the other to be <lb/>
            feared. To literature both gave equal attention. The father <lb/>
            had more cunning, the son more honour. Philip was more <lb/>
            staid in his words, Alexander in his actions. The son felt <lb/>
            readier and nobler impulses to spare the conquered; the father <lb/>
            showed no mercy even to his allies. The father was more <lb/>
            inclined to frugality, the son to luxury. By the same course by <lb/>
            which the father laid the foundations of the empire of the world, <lb/>
            the son consummated the glory of conquering the whole world.</p>

          <p>I. ARTAXERXES, t king of Persia, had a hundred and fifteen <lb/>
            sons by his concubines, but only three begotten in lawful wed. <lb/>
            lock, Darius, Ariarathes, and Ochus. Of these the father <lb/>
            from paternal fondness, made Darius king during his own life­ <lb/>
            time, contrary to the usage of the Persians, among whom the <lb/>
            king is changed only by death ; for he thought nothing taken <lb/>
            from himself that he conferred upon his son, and expected <lb/>
            greater enjoyment from having progeny, if he saw the insignia <lb/>
            of royalty adorning his son while he lived. But Darius, after <lb/>
            such an extraordinary proof of his father's affection, conceived <lb/>
            the design of killing him. He would have been bad enough, <lb/>
            if he had meditated the parricide alone, but he became so <note type="footnote"> * Convivio frequenter excessit.] " As in the cases of Clitus, Parmenio, <lb/>

            much the worse, by enticing fifty of his brothers to a participa. <lb/>
            tion in his crime, and making them parricides in intention as <lb/>
            well as himself. It was certainly a kind of prodigy, that, <lb/>
            among so great a number, the assassination should not only <lb/>
            have been plotted, but concealed, and that of fifty children <lb/>
            there should not have been found one, whom either respect for <lb/>
            their father's dignity, or reverence for an old man, or gratitude <lb/>
            for paternal kindness, could deter from so horrible a purpose. <lb/>
            Was the name of father so contemptible among so many sons, <lb/>
            that he who should have been secured even against enemies by <lb/>
            their protection, should be beset by their treason, and find it <lb/>
            easier to defend himself against his foes than his children ?</p>
          <p>II. The cause of the intended parricide was even more <lb/>
            atrocious than the crime itself; for after Cyrus was killed in <lb/>
            the war against his brother, of which mention has been pre­ <lb/>
            viously* made, Artaxerxes had married Aspasia, † the concu­ <lb/>
            bine of Cyrus; and Darius had required that his father should <lb/>
            resign her to him as he had resigned the kingdom. Artax­ <lb/>
            erxes, from fondness from his children, said at first that he would <lb/>
            do so, but afterwards, from a change of mind, and in order <lb/>
            plausibly to refuse what he had inconsiderately promised, <lb/>
            made her a priestess of the sun, an office which obliged her <lb/>
            to perpetual chastity. The young Darius, being incensed at <lb/>
            this proceeding, broke out at first into reproaches against his <lb/>
            father, and subsequently entered into this conspiracy with his <lb/>
            brothers. But while he was meditating destruction for his <lb/>
            father, he was discovered and apprehended with his associates, <lb/>
            and paid the penalty of his guilt to tho gods who avenge <lb/>
            paternal authority. The wives of them all, too, together with <lb/>
            their children, were put to death, that no memorial of such <lb/>
            execrable wickedness might be left. Soon after Artaxerxes died <lb/>
            of a disease contracted by grief, having been happier as a king <lb/>
            than as a father.</p>
          <p>III. Possession of the throne was given to Ochus, who, <lb/>
            dreading a similar conspiracy, filled the palace with the blood <lb/>
            and dead bodies of his kinsmen and the nobility, being touched <lb/>
            with compassion neither for consanguinity, nor sex, nor age, <lb/>
            lest, apparently, he should be thought less wicked than his <lb/>
            brothers that had meditated parricide. <note type="footnote"> * Book v. o. 11. </note><note type="footnote"> t Concerning whom see Ælian. Var. Hist. xii. 1. </note> <pb n="90"/>

            fellow soldiers, as well as the glory which they had almost <lb/>
            lost. For this honourable service Codomannus was made <lb/>
            governor of Armenia. Some time after, on the death of <lb/>
            Ochus, he was chosen king by the people from regard to his <lb/>
            former merits, and, that nothing might be wanting to his <lb/>
            royal dignity, honoured with the name of Darius. He main­ <lb/>
            tained a long war, with various success, but with great efforts, <lb/>
            against Alexander the Great. But being at last overcome by <lb/>

            oppressed with an unjust yoke, were excited with hopes of <lb/>

            tied, at another the Illyrians, Thracians, Dardanians, and <lb/>
            other barbarous nations, who were of wavering faith and per­ <lb/>
            fidious dispositions, and whom, if they should all rebel at once, <lb/>
            it would be utterly impossible to resist.</p>
          <p>To all these apprehensions the succession of Alexander <lb/>
            was a relief, who, in a public assembly, so effectually soothed <lb/>
            and encouraged the people, as to remove all uneasiness from <lb/>
            those that were afraid, and to fill every one with favourable <lb/>
            expectations. He was now twenty years old ; at which age he <lb/>
            gave great promise of what he would be, but with such <lb/>
            modesty, that it was evident he reserved the further proofs of <lb/>
            his ability for the time of action. He granted the Macedonians <lb/>
            relief from all burdens, except that of service in war; by <lb/>
            which conduct he gained such popularity with his subjects, <lb/>
            that they said they had changed only the person, not the <lb/>
            virtues, of their king.</p>
          <p>II. His first care was about his fathers funeral, when he <lb/>
            caused all who had been privy to his murder to be put to death at <lb/>
            his burial-place. The only one that he spared was Alexander <lb/>
            Lyncestest his brother, preserving in him the man who had first <lb/>
            acknowledged his royal authority, for he had been the first to <lb/>
            salute him king. His brother Caranus,t a rival for the throne, <lb/>
            as being the son of his step-mother, he ordered to be slain.</p>
          <p>In the beginning of his reign he put down many tribes that <lb/>
            were revolting, and quelled some seditions in their birth. <lb/>
            Encouraged by his success, he marched with haste into <lb/>
            Greece, where, after his father's example, having summoned <lb/>
            the states to meet at Corinth, he was appointed general in his <lb/>
            room. He then turned his attention to the war with Persia, <lb/>
            of which a commencement had been made by Philip; but, as <lb/>
            he was engaged in preparations for it, he received intelligence <lb/>
            that "the Thebans and Athenians had gone over from his <lb/>
            side to that of the Persians, and that the author of the de­ <lb/>

            that the whole army of the Macedonians, with their king, had <lb/>
            been cut off by the Triballi, producing the author of the infor­ <lb/>
            mation before an assembly of the people, a man who said that <lb/>
            he had been wounded in the battle in which the king had <lb/>
            fallen. In consequence of which statement," it was added, <lb/>
            " the feelings of almost all the cities were changed, and the <lb/>
            garrisons of the Macedonians besieged." To repress these <lb/>
            commotions, he marched upon Greece with an army in full <lb/>
            array, and with such expedition, that they could scarcely believe <lb/>
            they saw him of whose approach they were so little aware.</p>
          <p>III. In the course of his march he had exhorted the <lb/>
            Thessalians to peace, reminding them of the kindnesses* <lb/>
            shown them by his father Philip, and of his mother's con­ <lb/>
            nexion with them by the family of the Æacidæ.† The Thessa­ <lb/>
            lians gladly listening to such an address, he was chosen, like <lb/>
            his father, captain-general of the whole nation, and they <lb/>
            resigned into his hand all their customs and public revenues. <lb/>
            The Athenians, as they had been the first to rebel, were also <lb/>
            the first to repent of their rebellion, turning their contempt <lb/>
            for their enemy into admiration of him, and extolling the <lb/>
            youth of Alexander, which they had previously despised, above <lb/>
            the merits of old generals. Sending ambassadors, therefore, <lb/>
            they deprecated war; and Alexander, listening to their en­ <lb/>
            treaties, and severely reproving them for their conduct, laid <lb/>
            aside hostilities against them. He then directed his march <lb/>
            towards Thebes, intending to show similar indulgence, if he <lb/>
            found similar penitence. But the Thebans had recourse, not <lb/>
            to prayers or intreaties, but to arms, and, being conquered, <lb/>
            suffered the severest hardships of the most wretched state of <lb/>
            subjugation. It being debated in a council of war whether <lb/>
            the city should be destroyed, the Phocians, Plateaus, Thes­ <lb/>
            pians, and Orchomenians, who were the allies of Alexander <lb/>
            and sharers in his victory, dwelt upon the destruction of their <lb/>
            own cities and the cruelty of the Thebans, urging against <note type="footnote"> * See vii 6. </note><note type="footnote"> t The Æacidæ were the descendants of Æacus, the father 0 <lb/>

            them not only their present, but former, defection to the <lb/>
            Persians, to the prejudice of the common liberty of Greece; <lb/>
            " on which account," they said, " they were an object of gene­ <lb/>
            ral hatred, as was manifest from the fact that all the Greeks <lb/>
            had bound themselves by an oath to demolish Thebes as soon <lb/>
            as they had conquered the Persians." They brought forward <lb/>
            also the fabulous accounts of their old crimes, with which they <lb/>
            had filled every theatre, to make them odious not only for <lb/>
            their recent perfidy, but for their ancient infamy.</p>
          <p>IV. Cleadas, one of those who had been taken prisoners, <lb/>
            being permitted to speak in their behalf, said, that " they had <lb/>
            not revolted from the king, whom they understood to be killed, <lb/>
            out from the king's heirs ; that what had been done in the <lb/>
            matter was the fault, not of treachery, but of credulity;* for <lb/>
            which, however, they had already suffered severely by the loss <lb/>
            of the flower of their soldiery ; that there was left them only <lb/>
            a multitude of old men and women, equally weak and harm­ <lb/>
            less, but who had been so harassed by contumelies and <lb/>
            insults, that they had never endured anything more grievous; <lb/>
            and that he did not now intercede for his countrymen, of <lb/>
            whom so few survived, but for their unoffending natal soil, <lb/>
            and for a city which had given birth, not only to men, but to <lb/>
            gods." †He endeavoured to work upon the king, too, from <lb/>
            his superstitious regard for Hercules, who had been born at <lb/>
            Thebes, and from whom the family of the Æacidæwas descended, <lb/>
            and from the reflection that the youth of his father Philip had <lb/>
            been spent at Thebes; and he conjured him " to spare a city <lb/>
            which adored some of his ancestors, who had been born in it, <lb/>
            as gods, and saw others who had been brought up in it, <lb/>
            princes of the highest dignity." But resentment was more <lb/>
            powerful than entreaty. The city was in consequence de­ <lb/>
            molished, the lands divided among the conquerors, and the <lb/>
            prisoners publicly sold, their price being settled not for the <lb/>
            profit of those who bought them, but according to the hatred <lb/>
            of their enemies.‡ Their fate seemed to the Athenians <note type="footnote"> * Credulitatis.] Tauchnitz's edition has crudelitatis, by an error, <lb/>

            king's prohibition, opened their gates for the reception of the <lb/>
            exiles. At this proceeding Alexander was so displeased, that <lb/>
            when they deprecated war by a second embassy, he forbore <lb/>
            from hostilities only on condition that their orators and <lb/>
            leaders, through confidence in whom they had so often re­ <lb/>
            belled, should be delivered up to him. The Athenians prepar­ <lb/>
            ing to comply, lest they should be compelled to abide a war, the <lb/>
            matter ended in this arrangement, that the orators should <lb/>
            be retained and the generals banished; when the latter im­ <lb/>
            mediately went over to Darius, and formed no inconsiderable <lb/>
            addition to the strength of the Persians.</p>
          <p>V. When he set out to the Persian war, he put to death all <lb/>
            his step-mother's relations - whom Philip had advanced to <lb/>
            any high dignity, or appointed to any command. Nor did <lb/>
            he spare such of his own kinsmen as seemed qualified to fill <lb/>
            the throne, lest any occasion for rebellion should be left in <lb/>
            Macedonia during his absence ; and of the tributary princes <lb/>
            he took such as were distinguished for ability to the war with <lb/>
            him, leaving the less able at home for the defence of his <lb/>
            dominions. Having then assembled his troops, he put them <lb/>
            on shipboard, where, excited with incredible animation at the <lb/>
            sight of Asia, he erected altars to the twelve gods to offer <lb/>
            prayers for success in the war. He divided all his private <lb/>
            property, which he had in Macedonia and the rest of Europe, <lb/>
            among his friends, saying, "that for himself Asia was suf­ <lb/>
            ficient." Before any ship left the shore, lie offered sacrifices, <lb/>
            praying for " victory in that war, in which he had been chosen <lb/>
            the avenger of Greece so often assailed by the Persians, <lb/>
            to whom," he said, "a reign sufficiently long had been granted, <lb/>
            a reign that had now reached maturity, and it was time that <lb/>
            others, who would conduct themselves better, should take their <lb/>
            place." Nor were the anticipations of the army different from <lb/>
            those of the priace; for all the soldiers, unmindful of their <lb/>
            wives and children, and of the length of the expedition from <lb/>
            nome, contemplated the Persian gold, and the wealth of the <lb/>
            whole east, as already their own prey, thinking neither of the <lb/>
            war nor its perils, but of riches only. When they arrived at <note type="footnote"> to get an old enemy into his power to torture him as a slave, he offered <lb/>

            the continent of Asia, Alexander first of all threw a dart into <lb/>
            the enemy's country, and leaped on the shore in full armour, <lb/>
            like one dancing the tripudium.* He then proceeded to offer <lb/>
            sacrifices, praying that " those countries might not unwillingly <lb/>
            receive him as their king." He also sacrificed at Troy, at the <lb/>
            tombs of the heroes who had fallen in the Trojan war.</p>
          <p>VI. Marching forward in quest of the enemy, he kept the <lb/>
            soldiers from ravaging Asia, telling them that " they ought to <lb/>
            spare their own property, and not destroy what they came to <lb/>
            possess." His army consisted of thirty-two thousand infantry, <lb/>
            and four thousand five hundred cavalry, with a hundred and <lb/>
            eighty-two ships. Whether, with this small force, it is more <lb/>
            wonderful that he conquered the world, or that he dared to <lb/>
            attempt its conquest, is difficult to determine. When he <lb/>
            selected his troops for so hazardous a warfare, he did not <lb/>
            choose robust young men, or men in the flower of their age, <lb/>
            but veterans, most of whom had even passed their term of <lb/>
            service, and who had fought under his father and his uncles; t <lb/>
            so that he might be thought to have chosen, not soldiers, but <lb/>
            masters in war. No one was made an officer‡who was not <lb/>
            sixty years of age; so that he who saw the captains assembled <lb/>
            at head-quarters,§ would have declared that he saw the senate <lb/>
            of some ancient republic. None, on the field of battle, <lb/>
            thought of flight, but every one of victory; none trusted in his <lb/>
            feet, but every one in his arms.</p>
          <p>King Darius, on the other hand, from confidence in his <lb/>
            strength, abstained from all artifice in his operations ; observ­ <note type="footnote"> * Tripudianti similis.] The tripudium was a sort of dance in which <lb/>

            ing that " clandestine measures were fit only for a stolen <lb/>
            victory;" he did not attempt to repel the enemy from his <lb/>
            frontiers, but admitted them into the heart of his kingdom, <lb/>
            thinking it more honourable to drive war out of his kingdom <lb/>
            than not to give it entrance. The first engagement, in conse­ <lb/>
            quence, was fought on the plains of Adrastia.* The Persian <lb/>
            army consisted of six hundred thousand men, who were con­ <lb/>
            quered not less by the valour of the Macedonians than by the <lb/>
            conduct of Alexander, and took to flight. The slaughter <lb/>
            among the Persians was great. Of the army of Alexander <lb/>
            there fell only nine foot-soldiers, and a hundred and twenty <lb/>
            horse, whom the king buried sumptuously as an encourage­ <lb/>
            ment to the rest, honouring them also with equestrian statues, <lb/>
            and granting privileges to their relatives. After this victory <lb/>
            the greater part of Asia came over to his side. He had also <lb/>
            several encounters with Darius's lieutenants, whom he con­ <lb/>
            quered, not so much by his arms, as by the terror of his <lb/>
            name.</p>
          <p>VII. During the course of these proceedings, he was <lb/>
            acquainted, on the information of a certain prisoner, that a <lb/>
            conspiracy was forming against him by Alexander Lyncestes <lb/>
            the son-in-law of Antipater, who had been made governor of <lb/>
            Macedonia. Fearing, therefore, that, if he were put to death, <lb/>
            some disturbance might arise in Macedonia, he only kept him <lb/>
            in prison.!</p>
          <p>He soon after marched to a city called Gordium, which is <lb/>
            situated between the Greater and Lesser Phrygia, and which <lb/>
            he earnestly desired to take, not so much for the sake of <lb/>
            plunder, as because he had heard that in that city, in the <lb/>
            temple of Jupiter, was deposited the yoke of Gordius's car; <lb/>
            the knot of which, if any one should loose, the oracles of old <lb/>
            had predicted that he should rule all Asia. The cause and <lb/>
            origin of the matter was as follows. When Gordius was <lb/>
            ploughing in these parts, with oxen that he had hired,‡ <lb/>
            birds of every kind began to fly about him. Going to consult <lb/>
            the augurs of the next town on the occurrence, he met at the <note type="footnote"> * Campis Adrastiœ.] Through which flows the river Granicus, from <lb/>
            which the battle is generally named. </note><note type="footnote"> t He was, however, afterwards put to death. See xii. 14, init. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡Bubus conductis.] It is specified that they were hired, to denote <lb/>

            gate a virgin of remarkable beauty, and asked her " which of <lb/>
            the augurs he had best consult." When she, having heard his <lb/>
            reason for consulting them, and knowing something of the <lb/>
            art from the instruction of her parents, replied, that " a king­ <lb/>
            dom was portended to him," and offered to become his wife <lb/>
            and the sharer of his expectations. So fair a match seemed <lb/>
            the chief felicity of a throne. After his marriage a civil war <lb/>
            arose among the Pbrygians; and when they consulted the <lb/>
            oracles how their discord might be terminated, the oracles <lb/>
            replied that " a king was required to settle their disputes." <lb/>
            Inquiring a second time as to the person of the king, they <lb/>
            were directed to regard him as their king whom they should <lb/>
            first observe, on their return, going to the temple of Jupiter <lb/>
            on a car. The person who presented himself to them was <lb/>
            Gordius, and they at once saluted him king. He dedicated <lb/>
            the car, in which he was riding when the throne was offered <lb/>
            him, " to kingly majesty," and it was placed in the temple of <lb/>
            Jupiter. After him reigned his son Midas, who, having been <lb/>
            instructed by Orpheus in sacred rites, filled all Phrygia with <lb/>
            ceremonies of religion, by which he was better protected, <lb/>
            during his whole life, than by arms. Alexander, having taken <lb/>
            the city, and gone to the temple of Jupiter, requested to see <lb/>
            the yoke of Gordiuss car, and, when it was shown him, not <lb/>
            being able to find the ends of the cords, which were hidden <lb/>
            within the knots, he put a forced interpretation on the oracle, <lb/>
            and cut the cords with his sword; and thus, when the invo­ <lb/>
            lutions were opened out, discovered the ends concealed in <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>VIlI. While he was thus engaged, intelligence was brought <lb/>
            him that Darius was approaching with a vast army. Fearing <lb/>
            the defiles, he crossed Mount Taurus with the utmost expedition, <lb/>
            advancing, in one of his forced marches, five hundred stadia.* <lb/>
            Arriving at Tarsus, and being charmed with the pleasant­ <lb/>
            ness of the river Cydnus, which flows through the midst of the <lb/>
            city, he threw off his armour, and, covered as he was with <lb/>
            dust and sweat, plunged himself into the water, which was <lb/>
            then excessively cold; when, on a sudden, such a numbness <lb/>
            seized his nerves, that his voice was lost, and not only was <lb/>
            there no hope of saving his life, but not even a means of <note type="footnote"> * About fifty-seven miles and a half, the Greek stadium being equal <lb/>

            delaying death could be found. One of his physicians, named <lb/>
            Philippus, was the only person that promised a cure; but a <lb/>
            letter from Parmenio, which arrived the day before from <lb/>
            Cappadocia, rendered him an object of suspicion; for Par­ <lb/>
            menio, knowing nothing of Alexander's illness, had written <lb/>
            to caution him against trusting Philippus, as he had been <lb/>
            bribed by Darius with a large sum of money. Alexander, <lb/>
            however, thought it better to trust the doubtful faith of the <lb/>
            physician, than to perish of certain disease. Taking the cup <lb/>
            from Philippus, therefore, he gave him Parmenio's letter to <lb/>
            read, and, as he drank, fixed his eyes upon the physician's <lb/>
            countenance while he was reading. Seeing him unmoved, he <lb/>
            became more cheerful, and recovered his health on the fourth <lb/>
            day after.</p>
          <p>IX. Meantime Darius advanced to battle with four hundred <lb/>
            thousand foot and a hundred thousand horse. So vast a mul­ <lb/>
            titude of enemies caused some distrust in Alexander, when he <lb/>
            contemplated the smallness of his own army; but he called <lb/>
            to mind, at the same time, how much he had already done, <lb/>
            and how powerful people he had overthrown, with that very <lb/>
            moderate force. His hopes, therefore, prevailing over his ap­ <lb/>
            prehensions, and thinking it more hazardous to defer the <lb/>
            contest, lest dismay should fall upon his men, he rode round <lb/>
            among his troops, and addressed those of each nation in an <lb/>
            appropriate speech. He excited the Illyrians and Thracians <lb/>
            by describing the enemy's wealth and treasures, and the <lb/>
            Greeks by putting them in mind of their wars of old, and <lb/>
            their deadly hatred towards the Persians. He reminded the <lb/>
            Macedonians at one time of their conquests in Europe, and at <lb/>
            another of their desire to subdue Asia, boasting that no troops <lb/>
            in the world had been found a match for them, and assuring <lb/>
            them that this battle would put an end to their labours and <lb/>
            crown their glory. In the course of these proceedings he <lb/>
            caused the army occasionally to halt, that they might, by such <lb/>
            stoppages, accustom themselves to endure the sight of so great <lb/>
            a multitude. Nor was Darius less active in drawing up Lis <lb/>
            forces. Rejecting the services of his officers, he rode himself <lb/>
            through the whole army, encouraged the several divisions, and <lb/>
            put them in mind of the ancient glory of the Persians, and the <lb/>
            perpetual possession of empire vouchsafed them by the im <lb/>
            mortal gods. Soon after a battle was fought with great spirit. <pb n="99"/>
            <note type="margin"> B.C. 332.] </note> <lb/>
            Both kings were wounded in it. The result remained doubt <lb/>
            ful until Darius fled, when there ensued a great slaughter of <lb/>
            the Persians, of whom there fell sixty-one thousand infantry <lb/>
            and ten thousand horse, and forty thousand were taken <lb/>
            prisoners. On the side of the Macedonians were killed a <lb/>
            hundred and thirty foot and a hundred and fifty horse. In <lb/>
            the camp of the Persians was found abundance of gold and <lb/>
            other treasures; and among the captives taken in it were the <lb/>
            mother and wife, who was also the sister, of Darius, and two <lb/>
            of his daughters. When Alexander came to see and console <lb/>
            them, they threw themselves, at the sight of his armed attend­ <lb/>
            ants, into one another's arms, and uttered mournful cries, as <lb/>
            if expecting to die immediately. Afterwards, falling at the <lb/>
            feet of Alexander, they begged, not that they might live, but <lb/>
            that their death might be delayed till they should bury the <lb/>
            body of Darius. Alexander, touched with the respectful con­ <lb/>
            cern of the princesses for Darius, assured them that the king <lb/>
            was still alive, and removed their apprehensions of death; <lb/>
            directing, at the same time, that they should be treated as <lb/>
            royal personages, and giving the daughters hopes of husbands <lb/>
            suitable to the dignity of their father.</p>
          <p>X. As he afterwards contemplated the wealth and display <lb/>
            of Darius, he was seized with admiration of such magnificence. <lb/>
            Hence it was that he first began to indulge in luxurious and <lb/>
            splendid banquets, and fell in love with his captive Barsine <lb/>
            for her beauty, by whom he had afterwards a son that he <lb/>
            called Hercules. Not forgetting, however, that Darius was <lb/>
            still alive, he despatched Parmenio to seize the Persian fleet, <lb/>
            and commissioned some others of his friends to secure the <lb/>
            cities of Asia, which, on hearing the report of the victory, had <lb/>
            immediately submitted to the conqueror, the satraps of Darius <lb/>
            surrendering themselves with a vast quantity of treasure. He <lb/>
            next marched into Syria, where he was met by several princes <lb/>
            of the east with fillets on their heads.* Of these, according <lb/>
            to their respective deserts, he received some into alliance; <lb/>
            others he deprived of their thrones, and put new kings in <lb/>
            their places. Above the rest Abdolonymus, appointed by <lb/>
            Alexander king of Sidon, stood pre-eminent; a man whom, <lb/>
            when he was living a life of poverty, being accustomed to <lb/>
            draw water, and water gardens for hire, Alexander made <note type="footnote"> * Cum infulis.] Denoting that they were suppliants. </note> <note type="footnote"> H 2 </note> <pb n="100"/>

            a king, setting aside the nobles, lest they should regard his <lb/>
            favour as shown to their birth, and not as proceeding from the <lb/>
            kindness of the giver.</p>
          <p>The city of Tyre sending Alexander, by the hands of a <lb/>
            deputation, a golden crown of great value, as a token of con­ <lb/>
            gratulation, he received their present kindly, and told them <lb/>
            that " he intended to visit Tyre to pay his vows to Hercules." <lb/>
            The deputies replying that " he would do that better at Old <lb/>
            Tyre,* and in the more ancient temple;" he was so provoked <lb/>
            with them, because they evidently deprecated his visit, that he <lb/>
            threatened their city with destruction. Bringing up his army, <lb/>
            soon after, to the island, he was met with a hostile resistance, <lb/>
            the Tyrians, from reliance on Carthage, being not less deter­ <lb/>
            mined than himself. The example of Dido had stimulated <lb/>
            the Tyrians; for that queen, after founding Carthage, had <lb/>
            secured the empire over the third part of the world;† and <lb/>
            they thought it would be dishonourable if their women should <lb/>
            show more courage in acquiring dominion than they in de <lb/>
            fending their liberty. They removed to Carthage, therefore, <lb/>
            such as were unfit for war, and sent at once for assistance, but <lb/>
            were, not long afterwards, reduced by treachery.t</p>
          <p>XI. Alexander next got possession of Rhodes and Cilicia§ <lb/>
            without an effort. He then went to the temple of Jupiter <lb/>
            Ammon, to consult the oracle about the event of his future <lb/>
            proceedings, and his own parentage. For his mother Olym­ <lb/>
            pias had confessed to her husband Philip, that " she had coil­ <lb/>
            ceived Alexander, not by him, but by a serpent of extraordinary <lb/>
            size." Philip, too, towards the end of his life, had publicly <lb/>
            declared that "Alexander was not his son;" and he accord­ <lb/>
            ingly divorced Olympias, as having been guilty of adultery. <lb/>
            Alexander, therefore, anxious to obtain the honour of divine <lb/>
            paternity, and to clear his mother from infamy, instructed the <lb/>
            priests, by messengers whom he sent before him, what answers <note type="footnote"> * Tyro vetcre.] Which had been besieged for thirteen years, and at <lb/>

            he wished to receive. The priests, as soon as he entered the <lb/>
            temple, saluted him as the son of Ammon. Alexander, pleased <lb/>
            with the god's adoption of him, directed that he should be re­ <lb/>
            garded as his son. He then inquired " whether he had taken <lb/>
            vengeance on all that had been concerned in the assassination <lb/>
            of his father." He was answered that " his father could <lb/>
            neither be assassinated, nor could die; but that vengeance for <lb/>
            Philip's death had been fully exacted." On putting a third <lb/>
            question, he was told that " success in all his wars, and do­ <lb/>
            minion over the world, was granted him." A response was <lb/>
            also given by the oracle to his attendants, that " they should <lb/>
            reverence Alexander as a god, and not as a king." Hence it <lb/>
            was that his haughtiness was so much increased, and a strange <lb/>
            arrogance arose in his mind, the agreeableness of demeanour, <lb/>
            which he had contracted from the philosophy of the Greeks and <lb/>
            the habits of the Macedonians, being entirely laid aside. On <lb/>
            his return from the temple of Ammon he founded Alexandria, <lb/>
            and desired that that colony of the Macedonians might be <lb/>
            considered the metropolis of Egypt.</p>
          <p>XII. Darius, having fled to Babylon, entreated Alexander, <lb/>
            in a letter, " to give him permission to redeem his prisoners,' <lb/>
            offering a large sum for their ransom. But Alexander demanded <lb/>
            his whole kingdom, and not a sum of money, as the price of <lb/>
            their release. Some time after, another letter from Darius <lb/>
            was brought to Alexander, in which one of his daughters was <lb/>
            offered him in marriage, and a portion of his kingdom. <lb/>
            Alexander replied that " what was offered was his own," and <lb/>
            desired him " to come to him as a suppliant, and to leave the <lb/>
            disposal of his kingdom to his conqueror." All hopes of peace <lb/>
            being thus lost, Darius resumed hostilities, and proceeded to <lb/>
            meet Alexander with four hundred thousand infantry and a <lb/>
            hundred thousand cavalry. On his march he was informed <lb/>
            that " his wife had died of a miscarriage, and that Alexander <lb/>
            had mourned for her death, and attended her funeral; acting, <lb/>
            in that respect, not from love, but merely from kindness of <lb/>
            feeling ; as Darius's wife had been visited by him but once, <lb/>
            though he had often gone to console his mother and her <lb/>
            little daughters."</p>
          <p>Darius now considered himself indeed overcome, since, after <lb/>
            losing so many battles, he was surpassed by his enemy even <lb/>
            in kindnesses, and declared that it was a consolation to hint <pb n="102"/>
            <note type="margin"> B.XI. CH.XIII. </note> <lb/>
            since he could not conquer, to be conquered by such an <lb/>
            ♦rnemy. He therefore wrote a third letter to Alexander, <lb/>
            thanking him for not having acted as an enemy towards his <lb/>
            family, and offering him a larger portion of his kingdom, even <lb/>
            as far as the river Euphrates, another of his daughters in <lb/>
            marriage, and thirty thousand talents for the other prisoners. <lb/>
            To this Alexander replied, that " thanks were needless from <lb/>
            an enemy; that nothing had been done by him to flatter <lb/>
            Darius, or to gain the means of mollifying him, with a view <lb/>
            either to the doubtful results of war, or to conditions of peace; <lb/>
            but that he had acted from a certain greatness of mind, by <lb/>
            which he had learned to fight against the forces of his ene­ <lb/>
            mies, not to take advantage of their misfortunes;" and he <lb/>
            promised at the same time, that he would comply with the <lb/>
            wishes of Darius, if he would be content to be second to him, <lb/>
            and not his equal; but that the universe could not be <lb/>
            governed by two suns, nor could the earth with safety have <lb/>
            two sovereigns; and that he must consequently either prepare <lb/>
            to surrender on that day, or to fight on the next, and must <lb/>
            promise himself no better success than he had already <lb/>
            experienced."</p>
          <p>XIII. On the next day they drew up their armies; when, <lb/>
            on a sudden, before they came to battle, a deep sleep fell on <lb/>
            Alexander, who was wearied with making arrangements. <lb/>
            Nothing but the presence of the king being wanting, in order <lb/>
            to commence the engagement, he was awakened, though with <lb/>
            difficulty, by Parmenio, and as those about him asked the <lb/>
            reason of his sleeping in the midst of danger, when he was <lb/>
            sparing of sleep even in time of security, he answered that <lb/>
            " he had been relieved from great concern, and that his repose <lb/>
            was occasioned by sudden freedom from apprehension, since <lb/>
            he should now engage with the forces of Darius in a body; <lb/>
            whereas he had dreaded, if the Persians should divide their <lb/>
            army, that the war would be greatly protracted." Before the <lb/>
            battle commenced, each army was an object of admiration to <lb/>
            its antagonists. The Macedonians admired the host of men <lb/>
            opposed to them, their stature, and the beauty of their <lb/>
            armour. The Persians were amazed that so many thousands <lb/>
            of their countrymen had been defeated by so small a force. <lb/>
            Nor did the kings forbear to ride round among their troops. <lb/>
            Darius told his men, that " if a division of the enemy were <pb n="103"/>
            <note type="margin"> B.C. 330.] </note> <lb/>
            made, scarcely one man would fall to ten. of his own armed <lb/>
            followers." Alexander exhorted the Macedonians " not to be <lb/>
            alarmed at the numbers of the enemy, their stature, or the <lb/>
            strangeness of their complexion." He bade them remember <lb/>
            only that " they were now fighting for the third time with the <lb/>
            same adversaries; and not to imagine that they had been <lb/>
            rendered braver by defeat, as they would bring into the field <lb/>
            with them the sad recollection of former disasters, and of the <lb/>
            blood shed in the two previous engagements;" adding, that <lb/>
            " Darius had the greater number of human beings, but he <lb/>
            himself the greater number of men." He admonished them <lb/>
            " to despise an army glittering with gold and silver, in which <lb/>
            they would find more spoil than danger, since victory was to <lb/>
            be gained, not by splendour of arms, but by the power of the <lb/>
            sword."</p>
          <p>XIV. Soon after, the battle was begun. The Mace­ <lb/>
            donians rushed upon the swords presented to them, with <lb/>
            contempt for an enemy whom they had so often defeated. <lb/>
            The Persians, on the other hand, were desirous to die rather <lb/>
            than be conquered. Seldom has there been so much blood <lb/>
            shed in a battle. Darius, when he saw his army repulsed, <lb/>
            wished himself to die, but was compelled by his officers to <lb/>
            flee. Some advising that the bridge over the Cydnus should <lb/>
            be broken down, in order to stop the advance of the enemy. <lb/>
            he said that " he would not provide for his safety in such a <lb/>
            way as to expose so many thousands of his followers to the <lb/>
            foe; and that the road which was open to himself, ought also <lb/>
            to be open to others." Alexander, meanwhile, made the most <lb/>
            hazardous efforts; where he saw the enemy thickest, and <lb/>
            fighting most desperately, there he always threw himself, <lb/>
            desiring that the peril should be his, and not his soldiers'. <lb/>
            By this battle he gained the dominion over Asia, in the fifth <lb/>
            year after his accession to the throne. His victory was so <lb/>
            decisive, that after it none ventured to rebel against him; and <lb/>
            the Persians, after a supremacy of so many years, patiently <note type="footnote"> * Very similar to what is said by Agamemnon, Il. ii, of the com­ <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B.XI. CH.XV. </note> <lb/>
            submitted to the yoke of servitude. After rewarding his <lb/>
            soldiers, and allowing them to recruit their strength for <lb/>
            thirty-four days, he took account of the spoil. He afterwards <lb/>
            found forty thousand talents in the city of Susa. Next he <lb/>
            took Persepolis, the metropolis of the kingdom of Persia, a <lb/>
            city which had been eminent for many years, and which was <lb/>
            filled with the spoils of the world, as was now first seen at its <lb/>
            destruction. In the course of these proceedings, about eight <lb/>
            hundred Greeks met Alexander,- men who had been punished <lb/>
            in captivity by mutilation of their bodies, and who entreated <lb/>
            that, " as he had delivered Greece, he would also release them <lb/>
            from the cruelty of their enemies." Permission was given to <lb/>
            them to go home, but they preferred receiving portions of <lb/>
            land in Persia, lest, instead of causing joy to their parents by <lb/>
            their return, they should merely shock them by the horrid <lb/>
            spectacle which they presented.</p>
          <p>XV. Meanwhile, to gain the favour of the conqueror, Darius <lb/>
            was confined in golden fetters* and chains in a village of the <lb/>
            Parthians named Thara; the immortal gods, I suppose, <lb/>
            ordaining that the empire of the Persians should have its <lb/>
            termination in the country of those who were to succeed them <lb/>
            in dominion.t Alexander, hastening his march, arrived there <lb/>
            on the following day, when he found that Darius had been con­ <lb/>
            veyed from the place in the night, in a covered vehicle. <lb/>
            Directing his army to follow him, he pursued the flying <lb/>
            prince with six thousand cavalry. On his march he had several <lb/>
            severe encounters, and advanced many miles without finding <lb/>
            any traces of Darius. But while he was allowing the horses <lb/>
            time to rest, one of the soldiers, going to a neighbouring <lb/>
            spring, found Darius in the vehicle, wounded in several <lb/>
            places, but still alive. One of the Persian captives being <lb/>
            brought forward, the dying prince, knowing from his voice <lb/>
            that he was his countryman, said that " he had at least this <lb/>
            comfort in his present sufferings, that he should speak to one <lb/>
            who could understand him, and that be should not utter his <lb/>
            last words in vain." He then desired that the following <lb/>
            message should be given to Alexander: that "he died with­ <lb/>
            out having done him any acts of kindness, but a debtor to him <note type="footnote"> * See note on vi. 11. </note><note type="footnote"> t The Parthians, revolting from the Syrians, founded a new empire <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> B.C. 329.] </note> <lb/>
            for the greatest, since he had found his feelings towards his <lb/>
            mother and children to be those of a prince, not of a foe ; that <lb/>
            he had been more happy in his enemy than in his relations, <lb/>
            for by his enemy life had been granted to his mother and <lb/>
            children, but taken from himself by his relatives, to whom he <lb/>
            had given both life and kingdoms ; and that such a requital <lb/>
            must therefore be made them as his conqueror should please. <lb/>
            For himself, that he made the only return to Alexander which <lb/>
            he could at the point of death, by praying to the gods above <lb/>
            and below, and the powers that protected kings, that the <lb/>
            empire of the world might fall to his lot. That he desired <lb/>
            the favour of a decent rather than a magnificent funeral; and, <lb/>
            as to avenging his death, it was not his cause alone that was <lb/>
            concerned, but precedent, and the common cause of all kings, <lb/>
            which it would be both dishonourable and dangerous for him <lb/>
            to neglect; since, in regard to vengeance, the interests of <lb/>
            justice were affected, and, in regard to precedent, those of the <lb/>
            general safety. To this effect he gave him his right hand, <lb/>
            as the only pledge of a king's faith to be conveyed to Alex­ <lb/>
            ander." Then, stretching out his hand, he expired.</p>
          <p>When this intelligence was communicated to Alexander, he <lb/>
            went to see the body of the dead monarch, and contemplated <lb/>
            with tears a death so unsuitable to his dignity. He also <lb/>
            directed his corpse to be buried as that of a king, and his <lb/>
            relics to be conveyed to the sepulchres of his ancestors.</p>

            <note type="margin"> [B.XII. CH.II. </note> <lb/>
            teen thousand talents among the rest that attended him in <lb/>
            that expedition. Of the horses, the greater part were killed <lb/>
            by the heat; and those that survived were rendered unfit for <lb/>
            service. All the treasure, amounting to a hundred and ninety <lb/>
            thousand talents, was conveyed to Ecbatana, and Parmenio <lb/>
            was entrusted with the charge of it. In the midst of these <lb/>
            proceedings, letters from Antipater in Macedonia were brought <lb/>
            to Alexander, in which the war of Agis king of Sparta in <lb/>
            Greece, that of Alexander king of Epirus in Italy, and that of <lb/>
            Zopyrion his own lieutenant-general in Scythia, were comma­ <lb/>
            nicated. At this news he was affected with various emotions, <lb/>
            but felt more joy at learning the deaths of two rival kings, <lb/>
            than sorrow at the loss of Zopyrion and his army.</p>
          <p>After the departure of Alexander from Macedonia, almost <lb/>
            all Greece, as if to take advantage of the opportunity for <lb/>
            recovering their liberty, had risen in arms, yielding, in that <lb/>
            respect, to the influence of the Lacedæmonians, who alone <lb/>
            had rejected peace from Philip and Alexander, and had <lb/>
            scorned the terms on which it was offered. The leader in this <lb/>
            insurrection was Agis, king of the Lacedæmonians, but Anti­ <lb/>
            pater, assembling an army, suppressed the commotion in its <lb/>
            infancy. The slaughter, however, was great on both sides; <lb/>
            for king Agis, when he saw his men taking to flight, dismissed <lb/>
            his guards, and, that he might seem inferior to Alexander in <lb/>
            fortune only, not in valour, made such a havoc among the <lb/>
            enemy, that he sometimes drove whole troops before him. At <lb/>
            last, overpowered by numbers, he fell superior to all in glory.</p>
          <p>II. Alexander, too, the king of Epirus, having been invited <lb/>
            into Italy by the Tarentines, who desired his assistance against <lb/>
            the Bruttians, had gone thither as eagerly as if, in a division <lb/>
            of the world, the east had fallen by lot to Alexander, the son <lb/>
            of his sister Olympias, and the west to himself, and as if he <lb/>
            was likely to have not less to do in Italy, Africa, and Sicily, <lb/>
            than Alexander in Asia and Persia. To this was added, that <lb/>
            as the oracle at Delphi had forewarned Alexander the Great <lb/>
            against treachery in Macedonia, so that of Jupiter at Dodona <lb/>
            had admonished the other Alexander " to beware of the city <lb/>
            Pandosia and the river Acheron;" and as both these were in <lb/>
            Epirus, and he was ignorant that they were also to be found <lb/>
            in Italy, he had the more eagerly fixed on this foreign expe­ <lb/>
            dition, in hope of escaping the dangers signified in the warn <pb n="107"/>
            <note type="margin"> B.C. 330.] </note> <lb/>
            ing. On his arrival in Italy, his first contest was with the <lb/>
            Apulians; but when he learned the destiny appointed to their <lb/>
            city, he soon concluded a peace and alliance with their king. <lb/>
            The chief city of the Apulians, at that time, was Brundusium, <lb/>
            which a party of Ætolians that followed Diomede, a leader <lb/>
            rendered famous and honourable by his achievements at Troy, <lb/>
            had founded; but being expelled by the Apulians, and having <lb/>
            recourse to some oracle, they received for answer that " they <lb/>
            would possess for ever the place which they had sought to re­ <lb/>
            cover," On this ground they demanded of the Apulians that <lb/>
            their city should be restored, threatening them with war unless <lb/>
            the demand should be complied with. But the oracle be­ <lb/>
            coming known to the Apulians, they put the ambassadors to <lb/>
            death, and buried them in the city, that they might have a <lb/>
            perpetual abode there; and, having thus given the oracle a ful­ <lb/>
            filment, they long kept possession of the city. Alexander, <lb/>
            hearing of this occurrence, and having great respect for the <lb/>
            oracles of antiquity, made an end of hostilities with the <lb/>
            Apulians.</p>
          <p>He engaged also in war with the Bruttians and Lucanians, <lb/>
            and captured several cities; and he formed treaties and alli­ <lb/>
            ances with the Metapontines, Pediculans, and Romans. But <lb/>
            the Bruttians and Lucanians, having collected reinforcements <lb/>
            from their neighbours, renewed the war with fresh vigour; <lb/>
            when the king was slain near the city Pandosia and the river <lb/>
            Acheron, not knowing the name of the fatal place before he <lb/>
            fell in it, and understanding, as he was expiring, that the <lb/>
            death, for fear of which he had fled from his country, had not <lb/>
            been to be dreaded in his country. The Thurians ransomed <lb/>
            his body at the public expense, and buried it.</p>
          <p>During these events in Italy, Zopyrion, who had been left <lb/>
            governor of Pontus by Alexander the Great, thinking that, if he <lb/>
            did not attempt something, he should be stigmatized as indo­ <lb/>
            lent, collected a force of thirty thousand men, and made war <lb/>
            upon the Scythians. But being cut off, with his whole army, <lb/>
            he paid the penalty for a rash attack upon an innocent people.</p>
          <p>III. When these occurrences were reported to Alexander, <lb/>
            who was then in Parthia, he assumed a show of grief on ac­ <lb/>
            count of his relationship to Alexander, and caused the army to <lb/>
            mourn for three days. But while all his men were expecting, <lb/>
            as if the war had been ended, to return to thei: country, and <pb n="108"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.XII. CH.IV. </note> <lb/>
            were embracing in imagination their wives and children, he <lb/>
            called a general assembly of the troops; in which he told <lb/>
            them that " nothing had been done in so many glorious bat­ <lb/>
            tles, if the barbarians more to the eastward should be left <lb/>
            unmolested; that he had not sought the body, but the throne, <lb/>
            of Darius; and that those who had revolted from his govern­ <lb/>
            ment must be punished." Having, by this speech, revived the <lb/>
            spirits of his soldiers for new exertions, he subdued Hyrcania <lb/>
            and the Mardians. Here Thalestris, or Minithya, queen of <lb/>
            the Amazons, came to meet him, having travelled for twenty- <lb/>
            five days, with three hundred women in her train, and through <lb/>
            extremely populous nations, in order to have issue by him. <lb/>
            Her appearance and arrival was a cause of astonishment to all, <lb/>
            both from her dress, which was an unusual one for women, <lb/>
            and from the object of her visit. To gratify her, thirteen days' <lb/>
            rest was allowed by the king; and when she thought herself <lb/>
            pregnant, she took her leave.</p>
          <p>Soon after, Alexander assumed the attire of the Persian <lb/>
            monarchs, as well as the diadem, which was unknown to the <lb/>
            kings of Macedonia, as if he gave himself up to the customs <lb/>
            of those whom he had conquered. And lest such innovations <lb/>
            should be viewed with dislike, if adopted by himself alone, <lb/>
            he desired his friends also to wear the long robe of gold and <lb/>
            purple. That he might imitate the luxury too, as well as <lb/>
            the dress of the Persians, he spent his nights among troops <lb/>
            of the king's concubines of eminent beauty and birth. To <lb/>
            these extravagances he added vast magnificence in fea-ting; <lb/>
            and lest his entertainments should seem jejune and parsi­ <lb/>
            monious,* he accompanied his banquets, according to the osten­ <lb/>
            tation of the eastern monarchs, with games ; being utterly <lb/>
            unmindful that power is accustomed to be lost, not gained, <lb/>
            by such practices.</p>
          <p>IV. During the course of these proceedings, there arose <lb/>
            throughout the camp a general indignation that he had so <lb/>
            degenerated from his father Philip as to abjure the very name <lb/>
            of his country, and to adopt the manners of the Persians, <note type="footnote"> Luxuria destructa.] Grævius, not knowing what to make of <lb/>
            destructa, conjectures rutricta. Wetzel explains the words thus : <lb/>
            " Lest, as the empire of the Persians was destroyed, the luxury of the <lb/>
            Persians should seem also to be destroyes."I incline to think with <lb/>
            Grævius that the word is corrupt. </note> <pb n="109"/>
            <note type="margin"> B.C. 327.] </note> <lb/>
            whom, from the effect of such manners, he had overcome. <lb/>
            But that he might not appear to be the only person who <lb/>
            yielded to the vices of those whom he had conquered in the <lb/>
            field, he permitted his soldiers also, if they had formed a <lb/>
            connexion with any of the female captives, to marry them ; <lb/>
            thinking that they would feel less desire to return to their <lb/>
            country, when they had some appearance of a house and home <lb/>
            in the camp, and that the fatigues of war would be relieved <lb/>
            by the agreeable society of their wives. He saw, too, that <lb/>
            Macedonia would be less drained to supply the army, if the <lb/>
            sons, as recruits, should succeed their veteran fathers, and <lb/>
            serve within the ramparts within which they were born, and <lb/>
            would be likely to show more courage, if they passed, not only <lb/>
            their earliest days of service, but also their infancy, in the <lb/>
            camp. This custom was also continued under Alexanders <lb/>
            successors. Maintenance was provided for the boys, and <lb/>
            arms and horses were given them when they grew up; and <lb/>
            rewards were assigned to the fathers in proportion to the <lb/>
            number of their children. If the fathers of any of them were <lb/>
            killed, the orphans notwithstanding received their father's <lb/>
            pay ; and their childhood was a sort of military service in <lb/>
            various expeditions. Inured from their earliest years to toils <lb/>
            and dangers, they formed an invincible army; they looked <lb/>
            upon their camp as their country, and upon a battle as a <lb/>
            prelude to victory.</p>
          <p>V. Alexander, meanwhile, began to show a passionate <lb/>
            temper towards those about him, not with a princely severity, <lb/>
            but with the vindictiveness of an enemy. What most in­ <lb/>
            censed him was, that reflections were cast upon him in the <lb/>
            common talk of the soldiers, for having cast off the <lb/>
            customs of his father Philip and of his country. For this <lb/>
            offence, Parmenio, an old man, next to the king in rank, and <lb/>
            his son Philotas, were put to death ; an examination by <lb/>
            torture having been previously held on both of them. At <lb/>
            this instance of cruelty, all the soldiers, throughout the camp, <lb/>
            began to express their displeasure, being concerned for the <lb/>
            fate of the innocent old general and his son, and saying, at <lb/>
            times, that "they must expect nothing better for themselves." <lb/>
            These murmurs coming to the knowledge of Alexander, he, <lb/>
            fearing that such reports would be carried to Macedonia, and <lb/>
            that the glory of his victories would be sullied by the stain oJ <pb n="110"/>
             <note type="margin">[B.XI. CH.VI. </note> <lb/>
            cruelty, pretended that he was going to send home some of <lb/>
            his friends to give an account of his successes. He ex­ <lb/>
            horted his soldiers to write to their relatives, as they would now <lb/>
            have fewer opportunities on account of the scene of warfare be­ <lb/>
            ing further from home. The packets of letters, as they were <lb/>
            given in, he commanded to be privately brought to him, and <lb/>
            having learned from them what every one thought of him, he put <lb/>
            all those, who had given unfavourable opinions of his conduct, <lb/>
            into one regiment, with an intention either to destroy them, or to <lb/>
            distribute them in colonies in the most distant parts of the earth.</p>
          <p>He then subdued the Drancæ, the Evergetæ, the Parymæ, <lb/>
            the Parapammeni, the Adaspii, and other nations that dwelt at <lb/>
            the foot of Mount Caucasus.</p>
          <p>In the meantime Bessus, one of the former friends of <lb/>
            Darius, who had not only betrayed his sovereign, but put him <lb/>
            to death, was brought to Alexander in chains, who, that he <lb/>
            might be punished for his treachery, delivered him to the <lb/>
            brother of Darius to be tortured, considering not so much that <lb/>
            Darius had been his enemy, as that he had been the friend of <lb/>
            the man by whom he had been killed.</p>
          <p>That he might leave his name to these parts, he founded <lb/>
            the city of Alexandria on the river Tanais, completing a wall six <lb/>
            miles in circuit in seventeen days, and transplanting into it <lb/>
            the inhabitants of three cities that had been built by Cyrus. <lb/>
            He also built twelve cities in the territories of the Bactrians <lb/>
            and Sogdians, and distributed among them such of the <lb/>
            soldiers as he had found mutinous.</p>
          <p>VI. After these proceedings, he invited his friends on some <lb/>
            particular day, to a banquet, where mention being made, when <lb/>
            they were intoxicated, of the great things achieved by Philip, <lb/>
            he began to prefer himself to his father, and to extol the vast­ <lb/>
            ness of his own exploits to the skies, the greater part of the <lb/>
            company agreeing with him; and when Clitus, one of the <lb/>
            older guests, trusting to his hold on the king's friendship, in <lb/>
            which he held the principal place, defended the memory of <lb/>
            Philip, and praised his acts, he so provoked Alexander, that <lb/>
            he snatched a weapon from one of the guards, and slew him <lb/>
            with it in the midst of the guests. Exulting at the murder, <lb/>
            too, he scoffed at the dead man for his defence of Philip, and <lb/>
            his commendation of his mode of warfare. But when his <lb/>
            mind, satiated with the bloodshed, grew calm, and reflection <pb n="111"/>

            took the place of passion, he began, as he contemplated at <lb/>
            one time the character of the dead, and at another the occasion <lb/>
            of his death, to feel the deepest sorrow for the deed; grieving <lb/>
            that he had listened to his father's praises with more anger <lb/>
            than he ought to have listened to insults on his memory, and <lb/>
            that an old and blameless friend had been slain by him at a <lb/>
            feast and carousal. Driven, therefore, to repentance, with the <lb/>
            same vehemence with which he had before been impelled to <lb/>
            resentment, he determined to die. Bursting into tears, he <lb/>
            embraced the dead man, laid his hand on his wounds, and <lb/>
            confessed his madness to him as if he could hear; then, <lb/>
            snatching up a weapon, he pointed it against his breast, and <lb/>
            would have committed suicide, had not his friends interposed. <lb/>
            His resolution to die continued even for several days after; <lb/>
            for to his other causes of sorrow was added the remembrance <lb/>
            of his nurse, the sister of Clitus, on whose account, though she <lb/>
            was far away, he was greatly ashamed of his conduct, lament­ <lb/>
            ing that so base a return should be made her for rearing him; <lb/>
            and that, in the maturity of life and conquest, he should have <lb/>
            requited her, in whose arms he had spent his infancy, with <lb/>
            bloodshed instead of kindness. He reflected, too, what re­ <lb/>
            marks and odium he must have occasioned, as well in his own <lb/>
            army as among the conquered nations; what fear and dislike <lb/>
            of himself among his other friends; and how dismal and sad <lb/>
            he had rendered his entertainment, appearing not less to be <lb/>
            dreaded at a feast than when armed in the field of battle. <lb/>
            Parmenio and Philotas, his cousin Amyntas, his murdered <lb/>
            stepmother and brothers, with AttaIns, Eurylochus, Pausanias, <lb/>
            and other slaughtered nobles of Macedonia, presented them­ <lb/>
            selves to his imagination. He in consequence persisted in <lb/>
            abstaining from food for four days, until he was drawn from <lb/>
            bis purpose by the prayers of the whole army, who conjured <lb/>
            him " not to lament the death of one, so far as to ruin them <lb/>
            all; since, after bringing them into the remotest part of the <lb/>
            barbariaus' country, he would leave them amidst hostile <lb/>
            nations exasperated by war." The entreaties of Callisthenes <lb/>
            the philosopher had great effect upon him, a man who was <lb/>
            intimate with him from having been his fellow-student <lb/>
            under Aristotle, and who had been subsequently sent for, <lb/>
            by the king himself, to record his acts for the perusal of <lb/>
            posterity. <pb n="112"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.XII. CH.VII. </note> </p>
          <p>VII. Soon after, he gave orders that he should not be <lb/>
            approached with mere salutation, but with adoration;* a point <lb/>
            of Persian pride to which he had hesitated to advance at first, <lb/>
            lest the assumption of everything at once should excite too <lb/>
            strong a feeling against him. Among those who refused to <lb/>
            obey, the most resolute was Callisthenes; but his opposition <lb/>
            proved fatal, both to himself and to several other eminent <lb/>
            Macedonians, who were all put to death on the pretence that <lb/>
            they were engaged in a conspiracy. The custom of saluting <lb/>
            their king was however retained by the Macedonians, adora­ <lb/>
            tion being set aside.†</p>
          <p>He then marched into India, that he might have his empire <lb/>
            bounded by the ocean, and the extreme parts of the east. <lb/>
            That the equipments of his army might be suitable to the <lb/>
            glory of the expedition, he mounted the trappings of the <lb/>
            horses, and the arms of the soldiers, with silver, and called a <lb/>
            body of his men, from having silver shields, Argyraspides.‡ <lb/>
            On arriving at the city Nysa, he ordered the inhabitants, who, <lb/>
            from their confidence in being protected by their worship of <lb/>
            Bacchus, the founder of their city, made no resistance, to be <lb/>
            spared; rejoicing that he had not only followed the god's mili­ <lb/>
            tary achievements, but also his footsteps. He then led his <lb/>
            army to view the sacred mountain, which was clad with the <lb/>
            adornments of nature, the vine and ivy, as beautifully as if it <lb/>
            had been tilled by art, and decked by the labour of the culti­ <lb/>
            vator. But the troops, as they approached the hill, were <lb/>
            impelled, by a sudden commotion in their minds, to utter <lb/>
            devout cries to the god, and ran frantically up and down, to <lb/>
            the amazement of the king, but without suffering any harm ; <lb/>
            whence he might understand that, by sparing the town, he <lb/>
            had not so much secured its safety, as that of his own army.</p>
          <p>He next proceeded to the Dædalian mountains,§ and the <lb/>
            dominions of Queen Cleophis; who, after surrendering to <lb/>
            Alexander, recovered her throne from him by admitting him <note type="footnote"> * That is, with a kind of prostration. See Corn. Nep. Con. c. 3; <lb/>

            to her bed; saving by her charms what she had been unable <lb/>
            to secure by her valour. A son whom she had by him, she <lb/>
            named Alexander; and he afterwards sat upon the throne of <lb/>
            the Indians. Queen Cleophis, for allowing her chastity to be <lb/>
            violated, was thenceforward called by the Indians the royal <lb/>
            harlot.</p>
          <p>Having arrived, in his course through India, at a rock of <lb/>
            extraordinary ruggedness and altitude, to which many people <lb/>
            had fled for refuge, he learned that Hercules had been hin­ <lb/>
            dered from taking it by an earthquake. Seized with a desire, <lb/>
            in consequence, to go beyond the exploits of Hercules, he <lb/>
            made himself master of the rock with the utmost exertion <lb/>
            and peril, and received submission from all the tribes of that <lb/>
            part of the country.</p>
          <p>VIII. There was one of the kings of India, named Porus, <lb/>
            equally distinguished for strength of body and vigour of mind, <lb/>
            who, hearing of the fame of Alexander, had been for some <lb/>
            time before preparing for war against his arrival. Coming to <lb/>
            battle with him, accordingly, he directed his soldiers to attack <lb/>
            the rest of the Macedonians, but desired that their king should <lb/>
            be reserved as an antagonist for himself. Nor did Alexander <lb/>
            decline the contest; but his horse being wounded in the first <lb/>
            shock, he fell headlong to the ground, and was saved by his <lb/>
            guards gathering round him. Porus, covered with a number <lb/>
            of wounds, was made prisoner, and was so grieved at being <lb/>
            defeated, that when his life was granted him by the enemy, <lb/>
            he would neither take food nor suffer his wounds to be <lb/>
            dressed, and was scarcely at last prevailed upon to con­ <lb/>
            sent to live. Alexander, from respect to his valour, sent <lb/>
            him back in safety to his kingdom. Here he founded two <lb/>
            cities, one called Nicæa, and the other, from the name of his <lb/>
            horse, Bucephale.</p>
          <p>He then overthrew the Adrestæ, the Gesteani, the Preside <lb/>
            and the Gangaridæ, with great slaughter among their troops. <lb/>
            When he had reached the Cuphites, where the enemy awaited <lb/>
            him with two thousand cavalry, the whole army, wearied not <lb/>
            less with the number of their victories than with their toils in <lb/>
            the field, besought him with tears that " he would at length <lb/>
            make an end of war, and think on his country and his return; <lb/>
            considering the years of his soldiers, whose remainder of life <lb/>
            would scarcely suffice for their journey home." One pointed <pb n="114"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.XII. CH.IX. </note> <lb/>
            to his hoary hairs, another to his wounds, another to his body <lb/>
            worn out with an age, another to his person disfigured with <lb/>
            scars,* saying " that they were the only men who bad endured <lb/>
            unintermitted service under two kings, Philip and Alexander <lb/>
            and conjuring him in conclusion that " he should restore their <lb/>
            remains at least to the sepulchres of their fathers, since they <lb/>
            failed not in zeal but in age; and that, if he would not spare <lb/>
            his soldiers, he should yet spare himself, and not wear out his <lb/>
            good fortune by pressing it too far." Moved with these <lb/>
            reasonable supplications, he ordered a camp to be formed, as if <lb/>
            to mark the termination of his conquests, of greater size than <lb/>
            usual, by the works of which the enemy might be astonished, <lb/>
            and an admiration of himself be left to posterity. No task <lb/>
            did the soldiers execute with more alacrity. After great <lb/>
            slaughter of the enemy, they returned to this camp with <lb/>
            mutual congratulations.</p>
          <p>IX. From hence Alexander proceeded to the river Acesines, <lb/>
            and sailed down it into the ocean. In his way he received the <lb/>
            submission of the Hiacensanæ t and the Silei, whom Hercules <lb/>
            settled ; next he sailed to the Ambri and Sigambri,t who met <lb/>
            him with eighty thousand foot and sixty thousand horse. <lb/>
            Gaining the victory in a battle, he led his army against their <lb/>
            city; and supposing, as he looked from the wall, which he had <lb/>
            been the first to mount, that the place was destitute of <lb/>
            defenders, he leaped down into the area of the city without a <lb/>
            single attendant. The enemy, seeing him alone, gathered <lb/>
            round upon him with a shout, to try if by taking one life they <lb/>
            could put an end to war in the world, and exact vengeance for <lb/>
            the defeats of so many nations. Alexander withstood them <lb/>
            with equal spirit, fighting alone against thousands. It is, <lb/>
            indeed, incredible, that neither the multitude of enemies, nor <lb/>
            the thick showers of javelins, nor the loud outcries of his <lb/>
            assailants, could in the least alarm him; and that he alone <lb/>
            should have spread havoc and terror among so many thousands. <lb/>
            But seeing that he was likely to be overpowred by numbers, <note type="footnote"> * Cicatricibus exhausta.] Exhausta cannot surely have been Justin's. <lb/>

            he fixed himself against the trunk of a tree that stood by the <lb/>
            wall, by the help of which he long resisted a host, when, his <lb/>
            danger being known, his friends leaped down to him, many of <lb/>
            whom were slain, and the battle continued doubtful, till the <lb/>
            whole army, making a breach in the wall, came to his aid. <lb/>
            Being wounded in the struggle by an arrow, and likely to <lb/>
            faint through loss of blood, he placed his knee on the ground, <lb/>
            and fought till he had killed the man by whom he had been <lb/>
            wounded. The curing of the wound caused him more suffer­ <lb/>
            ing than the wound itself.</p>
          <p>X. Being at length restored to health, after there had been <lb/>
            great despair of it, he sent Polysperchon with the army to <lb/>
            Babylon, while he himself, with a select band of followers, went <lb/>
            on board the fleet, and sailed along the shore of the ocean. <lb/>
            When he came to the city of king Ambiger, the inhabitants, <lb/>
            hearing that he was invincible to the sword, tipped their arrows <lb/>
            with poison; and thus repulsing the enemy from their walls <lb/>
            with wounds doubly fatal, they killed a great number of them. <lb/>
            Ptolemy, with many others, being wounded, and seeming to <lb/>
            be at the point of death, a herb was shown to the king in a <lb/>
            dream as a cure for poison; this being taken in a drink, he <lb/>
            was freed from danger, and the greater part of the army were <lb/>
            saved by the same remedy. Taking the city afterwards by <lb/>
            storm, and returning to the fleet, he made oblations to the <lb/>
            ocean, praying for a prosperous return to his country; an i <lb/>
            having thus, as it were, driven his chariot round the goal, and <lb/>
            fixed the boundaries of his empire, as far as either the deserts <lb/>
            would suffer him to proceed by land, or the sea was navigable, <lb/>
            he sailed up the mouth of the river Indus with the tide. There <lb/>
            he built the city Barce, in memory of the exploits achieved by <lb/>
            him, and erected altars, leaving one of his friends as governor <lb/>
            of the Indians on the coast. As he intended to march from <lb/>
            thence by land, and as the parts in the middle of his route <lb/>
            were said to be dry, he ordered wells to be made in suitable <lb/>
            places, from which he got abundance of fresh water, and so <lb/>
            returned to Babylon. Hither many of the conquered people <lb/>
            sent deputations to accuse their governors, whom Alexander, <lb/>
            without any regard to his former friendship for them, com­ <lb/>
            manded to be put to death in the sight of the deputies.</p>
          <p>Soon after he married Statira, the daughter of king Darius ; <lb/>
            but, at the same time, he gave the noblest virgins chosen from <note type="footnote"> I a </note> <pb n="116"/>

            all the conquered natives, as wives to the chiefs of the Mace­ <lb/>
            donians; in order that the impropriety of the king's conduct* <lb/>
            might be rendered less glaring by the practice becoming <lb/>
            general.</p>
          <p>XI. He next assembled the army, and promised that is he <lb/>
            would pay all their debts at his own expense," so that they <lb/>
            might carry home their spoil and prizes undiminished. This <lb/>
            munificence was highly prized, not only for the sum given, but <lb/>
            for the character of the gift, and was received not more thank­ <lb/>
            fully by the debtors than by the creditors, exaction being as <lb/>
            troublesome to the one as payment to the other. Twenty <lb/>
            thousand talents were expended in this largess. Discharging <lb/>
            some of the veterans, he recruited the army with younger <lb/>
            soldiers. But those that were retained, murmuring at the dis­ <lb/>
            charge of the older men, demanded that they themselves should <lb/>
            be released likewise; desiring that " their years, not of life, <lb/>
            but of service, should be counted," and thinking it reasonable <lb/>
            that "those who had been enlisted in the service together, <lb/>
            should together be set free from the service." Nor did they <lb/>
            address the king only with entreaties, but also with reproaches, <lb/>
            bidding him " carry on his wars alone, with the aid of his <lb/>
            father Ammon, since he looked with disdain on his soldiers." <lb/>
            Alexander, on the other hand, sometimes upbraided his men, <lb/>
            and sometimes charged them in gentle terms, " not to tarnish <lb/>
            their glorious services by mutiny." At last, when he could <lb/>
            produce no effect by words, he leaped unarmed from his tri­ <lb/>
            bunal among the armed multitude, to lay hands on the authors <lb/>
            of the mutiny; and not a man daring to oppose him, he led <lb/>
            thirteen of them, whom he had seized with his own hand, to <lb/>
            punishment. Such submission to death did the fear of their <lb/>
            king produce in the men; or such courage in inflicting <lb/>
            punishment had his knowledge of military discipline given the <lb/>
            king.</p>
          <p>XII. He then addressed himself, in a public speech, to the <lb/>
            auxiliary troops of the Persians apart from the Macedonians. <lb/>
            He extolled their constant fidelity, as well as to himself as <lb/>
            to their former kings; he mentioned the kindnesses which he <lb/>
            had shown them, saying that "he had never treated them as <note type="footnote"> * Crimen regis Crimen, in this place, has not the ordinary signifi­ <lb/>

            a conquered people, but always as sharers in his successes; <lb/>
            that he had gone over to the usages of their nation, not they <lb/>
            to those of his ; and that he had mingled the conquerors with <lb/>
            the conquered by matrimonial connexions. And now," he <lb/>
            added, " he would entrust the guardianship of his person, not <lb/>
            to the Macedonians only, but also to them." Accordingly, he <lb/>
            enrolled a thousand of their young men among his body­ <lb/>
            guard ; and at the same time incorporated into his army a <lb/>
            portion of the auxiliaries, trained after the discipline of the <lb/>
            Macedonians. At this proceeding the Macedonians were <lb/>
            much dissatisfied, exclaiming that " their enemies were put <lb/>
            into their places by their king ;" and at length they all went <lb/>
            to Alexander in a body, beseeching him with tears " to content <lb/>
            himself rather with punishing than ill-treating them." By <lb/>
            this modest forbearance they produced such an effect upon <lb/>
            him, that he released eleven thousand veterans more. Of <lb/>
            his own friends, too, were sent away the old men, Polysperchon, <lb/>
            Clitus, Gorgias, Polydamas, Amadas, and Antigenes. Of <lb/>
            those that were sent home Craterus was appointed leader, and <lb/>
            commissioned to take the government of Macedonia in the <lb/>
            room of Antipater, whom he sent for, with a body of recruits, <lb/>
            to supply the place of Craterus. Pay was allowed to those <lb/>
            that went home, as if they had been still in the service. In <lb/>
            the course of those proceedings, Hephæstion, one of his <lb/>
            friends, died; a man who was a great favourite with Alex­ <lb/>
            ander, at first on account of his personal qualities in youth, <lb/>
            and afterwards from his servility. Alexander mourned <lb/>
            for him longer than became his dignity as a king, built a <lb/>
            monument for him that cost twelve thousand talents, and <lb/>
            gave orders that he should be worshipped as a god.</p>
          <p>XIII. As he was returning to Babylon, from the distant <lb/>
            shores of the ocean, he was acquainted that embassies from <lb/>
            the Carthaginians, and other states of Africa, as well as <lb/>
            from the Spains, Sicily, Gaul, and Sardinia, and some also <lb/>
            from Italy, were waiting his arrival at that city. So power- <lb/>
            fully had the terror of his name diffused itself through the <lb/>
            world, that all nations were ready to bow to him as their <lb/>
            destined monarch. When be was hastening to Babylon, <lb/>
            therefore, to hold an assembly, as it were, of the states of the <lb/>
            world, one of the Magi warned him " not to enter the city," <lb/>
            for that the place would be fatal to him." He accordingly <pb n="118"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.XII. CH.XIV. </note> <lb/>
            avoided Babylon, and turned aside to Borsippa, a city on the <lb/>
            other side of the Euphrates, that had been for some time <lb/>
            uninhabited. Here again be was persuaded by Anaxarchus <lb/>
            the philosopher, to slight the predictions of the Magi as <lb/>
            fallacious and uncertain ; observing that, "if things were fixed <lb/>
            by fate, they were unknown to mortals, and, if they <lb/>
            were dependent on the course of nature, were unchangeable." <lb/>
            Returning, therefore, to Babylon, and allowing himself several <lb/>
            days for rest, he renewed, in his usual manner, the ertertain­ <lb/>
            ments which had been for some time discontinued, resigning <lb/>
            himself wholly to mirth, and joining in his cups the night to the <lb/>
            day. As he was returning, on one occasion, from a banquet, <lb/>
            Medius, a Thessalian, proposing to renew their revelling, <lb/>
            invited him and his attendants to his house. Taking up a <lb/>
            cup, he suddenly uttered a groan while he was drinking, as if <lb/>
            he had been stabbed with a dagger, and being carried half <lb/>
            dead from the table, he was excruciated with such torture that <lb/>
            he called for a sword to put an end to it, and felt pain at the <lb/>
            touch of his attendants as if he were all over wounds. His <lb/>
            friends reported that the cause of his disease was excess in <lb/>
            drinking, but in reality it was a conspiracy, the infamy of <lb/>
            which the power of his successors threw into the shade.</p>
          <p>XIV. The author of this conspiracy was Antipater, who, <lb/>
            seeing that- his dearest friends were put to death, that <lb/>
            Alexander Lyncestes, his son-in-law, was cut off, and that he <lb/>
            himself, after his important services in Greece, was not so <lb/>
            much liked by the king as envied by him, and was also <lb/>
            persecuted with various charges by his mother Olympian; <lb/>
            reflecting, too, on the severe penalties inflicted, a few days <lb/>
            before, on the governors of the conquered nations, and hence <lb/>
            imagining that he was sent for from Macedonia, not to share <lb/>
            in the war, but to suffer punishment, secretly, in order to be <lb/>
            beforehand with Alexander, furnished his son Cassander with <lb/>
            poison, who, with his brothers Philippus and lollas, was <lb/>
            accustomed to attend on the king at table. The strength of <lb/>
            this poison was so great, that it could be contained neither in <lb/>
            brass, nor iron, nor shell, nor could be conveyed in any other <lb/>
            way than in the hoof of a horse. Cassander had been warned <note type="footnote"> * In the original there is no grammatical construction. Either the <lb/>

            to trust nobody but the Thessalian and his brothers ; and hence <lb/>
            it was that the banquet was prepared and renewed in the house <lb/>
            of the Thessalian. Philippus and lollas, who used to taste and <lb/>
            mix the king's drink, had the poison ready in cold water, <lb/>
            which they put into the drink after it had been tasted.</p>
          <p>XV. On the fourth day, Alexander, finding that death was <lb/>
            inevitable, observed that " he perceived the approach of the <lb/>
            fate of his family, for the most of the Æacidæ had died under <lb/>
            thirty years of age."* He then pacified the soldiers, who <lb/>
            were making a tumult, from suspecting that the king was the <lb/>
            victim of a conspiracy, and, after being carried to the highest <lb/>
            part of the city, admitted them to his presence, and gave <lb/>
            them his right hand to kiss. While they all wept, he not only <lb/>
            did not shed a tear, but showed not the least token of sorrow ; <lb/>
            so that he even comforted some who grieved immoderately, <lb/>
            and gave others messages to their parents; and his soul was <lb/>
            as undaunted at meeting death, as it had formerly been at <lb/>
            meeting an enemy. When the soldiers were gone, he asked <lb/>
            his friends that stood about him, " whether they thought they <lb/>
            should find a king like him?" All continuing silent, he said <lb/>
            that, "although he did not know that, he knew, and could <lb/>
            foretel, and almost saw with his eyes, how much blood Mace­ <lb/>
            donia would shed in the disputes that would follow his death, <lb/>
            and with what slaughters, and what quantities of gore, she <lb/>
            would perform his obsequies." At last he ordered his body to <lb/>
            be buried in the temple of Jupiter Ammon. When his <lb/>
            friends saw him dying, they asked him " whom he would ap­ <lb/>
            point as the successor to his throne?" He replied, "The <lb/>
            most worthy." Such was his nobleness of spirit, that though <lb/>
            he left a son named Hercules,t a brother called Aridæus,‡ <lb/>
            and his wife Roxane § with child, yet, forgetting his relations, <lb/>
            he named only " the most worthy" as his successor; as <lb/>
            though it were unlawful for any but a brave man to succeed a <lb/>
            brave man, or for the power of so great an empire to be left to <lb/>
            any but approved governors. But as if, by this reply, he had <note type="footnote"> * Intra trigesimum annum.]Yet he himself had passed his thirtieth <lb/>

            bounded the signal for battle among his friends, or had thrown <lb/>
            the apple of discord amongst them, they all rose in emulation <lb/>
            against each other, and tried to gain the favour of the army by <lb/>
            secretly paying court to the common soldiers. On the sixth <lb/>
            day from the commencement of his illness, being unable to <lb/>
            speak, he took his ring from his finger, and gave it to Perdiccaas; <lb/>
            an act which tranquillized the growing dissension among his <lb/>
            friends; for though Perdiccas was not expressly named his <lb/>
            successor, he seemed intended to be so in Alexander's <lb/>
            judgment.</p>
          <p>XVI. Alexander, when be died, was thirty-three years and <lb/>
            one month old. He was a man endowed with powers of mind <lb/>
            far beyond ordinary human capacity. His mother Olympias, <lb/>
            the night in which she conceived him, dreamed that she was <lb/>
            entwined with a huge serpent; nor was she deceived by her <lb/>
            dream; for she certainly bore in her womb a conception <lb/>
            superior to mortality; and though her descent from the</p>
          <p>.,acidam, a family of the remotest antiquity, and the royal 'dig­ <lb/>
            nity of her father brother, husband, and indeed of all her <lb/>
            ancestors, conferred sufficient splendour upon her, yet by no <lb/>
            one's influence was she rendered more illustrious than that of <lb/>
            her son. Some omens of his future greatness appeared at his <lb/>
            birth. Two eagles sat the whole of the day on which be was <lb/>
            born on the top of his father's palace, giving indication of his <lb/>
            double empire over Europe and Asia. The very same day, <lb/>
            too, his father received the news of two victories, one in the <lb/>
            war with the Illyrians, the other in the Olympic games, to <lb/>
            which he had sent some four-horse chariots ; an omen which <lb/>
            portended to the child the conquest of the world. As a boy, <lb/>
            he was ably instructed in elementary learning ; and, when his <lb/>
            boyhood was past, he improved himself, for five years, under <lb/>
            his famous instructor Aristotle. On taking possession of <lb/>
            the throne, he gave orders that he should be styled " King of <lb/>
            all the earth and of the world ;" and he inspired his soldiers <lb/>
            with such confidence in him, that, when he was present, they <note type="footnote"> * Sub Ariatotcle doctore inclyto [onium philosophorum]The words <lb/>

            feared the arms of no enemy, though they themselves were <lb/>
            unarmed. He, in consequence, never engaged with any enemy <lb/>
            whom he did not conquer, besieged no city that he did not <lb/>
            take, and invaded no nation that he did not subjugate. He <lb/>
            was overcome at last, not by the prowess of any enemy, but <lb/>
            by a conspiracy of those whom he trusted, and the treachery <lb/>
            of his own subjects.</p>

          <p>I. WHEN Alexander was thus cut off in the flower of his <lb/>
            age, and at the height of his successes, a mournful silence <lb/>
            prevailed among all people throughout Babylon. But the <lb/>
            conquered nations could not give credit to the report of his <lb/>
            death, because, as they had believed him to be invincible, <lb/>
            they had also conceived that he was immortal, reflecting how <lb/>
            frequently he had been snatched from imminent destruction, <lb/>
            and how often, when he was given up for lost, he had suddenly <lb/>
            presented himself to his soldiers, not only safe, but victorious. <lb/>
            As soon, however, as the report of his death was confirmed, <lb/>
            all the barbarous nations, whom he had shortly before subdued, <lb/>
            lamented for him, not as an enemy, but as a father. The <lb/>
            mother, too, of King Darius, who, though she had been <lb/>
            reduced, after the death of her son, from the summit of royal <lb/>
            dignity to the state of a captive, had, till that day, through the <lb/>
            kindness of the conqueror, never felt weary of life, corn <lb/>
            mitted suicide when she heard of the death of Alexander; <lb/>
            not that she felt more for an enemy. than she bad felt for <lb/>
            her son, but because she had experienced the attention of a <lb/>
            son from him whom she had feared as an enemy. The <lb/>
            Macedonians, on the other hand, did not mourn for him as a <note type="footnote"> * She survived the death of Darius, and killed herself on that of <lb/>

             <note type="margin">[B.XIII. CH.II. </note> <lb/>
            countryman, and a prince of such eminence, but rejoiced at <lb/>
            his death as at that of an enemy, execrating his excessive <lb/>
            severity and the perpetual hardships of war to which he <lb/>
            exposed them. The chiefs, moreover, were looking to <lb/>
            sovereignty and offices of command; the common soldiers to <lb/>
            the treasury and heaps of gold, as a prize unexpectedly pre­ <lb/>
            sented to their grasp; the one meditating on the possibility <lb/>
            of seizing the throne, the other on the means of securing <lb/>
            wealth and plenty; for there were in the treasury fifty <lb/>
            thousand talents, while the annual tribute produced thirty <lb/>
            thousand. Nor did the friends of Alexander look to the <lb/>
            throne without reason ; for they were men of such ability and <lb/>
            authority, that each of them might have been taken for a king. <lb/>
            Such was the personal gracefulness, the commanding stature, <lb/>
            and the eminent powers of body and mind, apparent in all of <lb/>
            them, that whoever did not know them, would have thought <lb/>
            that they had been selected, not from one nation, but from <lb/>
            the whole earth. Never before, indeed, did Macedonia, or <lb/>
            any other country, abound with such a multitude of distin­ <lb/>
            guished men ; whom Philip first, and afterwards Alexander, <lb/>
            had selected with such skill, that they seemed to have been <lb/>
            chosen, not so much to attend them to war, as to succeed <lb/>
            them on the throne. Who then can wonder, that the world <lb/>
            was conquered by such officers, when the army of the <lb/>
            Macedonians appeared to be commanded, not by generals, but <lb/>
            by princes ?—men who would never have found antagonists to <lb/>
            cope with them, if they had not quarrelled with one another; <lb/>
            while Macedonia would have had many Alexanders instead of <lb/>
            one, had not Fortune inspired them with mutual emulation for <lb/>
            their mutual destruction.</p>
          <p>II. But, when Alexander was taken off, their feelings of <lb/>
            security were not in proportion to their exultation; for they <lb/>
            were all competitors for the same dignity; nor did they fear <lb/>
            one another # more than the soldiery, whose licence was less <lb/>
            controllable, and whose favour was more uncertain. Their <lb/>
            very equality inflamed their discord, no one being so far <lb/>
            superior to the rest, that any other would submit to him. <note type="footnote"> * The text stands thus in Wetzel's and Gronovius's editions : nec <lb/>

            They therefore met in the palace under arms to settle the <lb/>
            present state of affairs. Perdiccas gave his opinion that <lb/>
            " they ought to wait till Roxane was delivered, who was now <lb/>
            eight months gone with child by Alexander; and that, if she <lb/>
            brought forth a boy, he should be appointed his father's suc­ <lb/>
            cessor." Meleager argued that" their proceedings should not be <lb/>
            suspended for the result of an uncertain birth ; nor ought they <lb/>
            to wait till kings were born, when they might choose from such <lb/>
            as were already born ; for if they wished for a boy, there was <lb/>
            at Pergamus a son of Alexander by Barsine, named Hercules; <lb/>
            or, if they would rather have a man, there was then in the <lb/>
            camp Aridæus, a brother of Alexander, a person of courteous <lb/>
            manners, and acceptable to every body, not only on his own <lb/>
            account, but on that of his father Philip. But that Roxane <lb/>
            was of Persian origin, and that it was unlawful that kings <lb/>
            should be chosen for the Macedonians from the blood of those <lb/>
            whose kingdoms they had overthrown; a choice to which <lb/>
            Alexander himself would not have consented, who, indeed, <lb/>
            when he was dying, made no mention of Roxane's issue." <lb/>
            Ptolemy objected to Aridæus as king, " not only on account of <lb/>
            the meanness of his mother (he being the son of a courtezan <lb/>
            of Larissa), but because of the extraordinary weakness with <lb/>
            which he was affected, lest, while he had the name of king, <lb/>
            another should exercise the authority ;" and said that " it <lb/>
            would be better for them to choose from those who were next <lb/>
            in merit to the king, and who could govern the provinces and <lb/>
            be entrusted with the conduct of wars, than to be subjected to <lb/>
            the tyranny of unworthy men under the authority of a king." <lb/>
            The opinion of Perdiccas was adopted with the consent of all; <lb/>
            and it was resolved to wait for the delivery of Roxane ; and, <lb/>
            if a boy should be born, they appointed Leonatus, Perdiccas. <lb/>
            Craterus, and Antipater, his guardians, to whom they at once <lb/>
            took an oath of obedience.</p>
          <p>III. When the cavalry had also taken the oath, the <lb/>
            infantry, indignant that no share in the deliberation had <lb/>
            been granted to them, proclaimed Aridæus, the brother of <lb/>
            Alexander, king, chose him guards from their own body, and <lb/>
            appointed that he should be called Philip, after the name of <lb/>
            his father. These proceedings being reported to the cavalry, <lb/>
            they despatched two of their officers, Attaius and Meleager, <lb/>
            to quell the excitement; but thev, hoping for power for them- <pb n="124"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.XIII. CH.IV. </note> <lb/>
            selves by flattering the multitude, neglected their commission, <lb/>
            and took part with the soldiers. The insurrection soon <lb/>
            gathered strength, when it once began to have a head and <lb/>
            regular management. The infantry rushed in a body, under <lb/>
            arms, to the palace, with a resolution to cut the cavalry <lb/>
            to pieces ; but the cavalry, hearing of their approach, retreated <lb/>
            in haste from the city, and after pitching their camp, began to <lb/>
            threaten the infantry in return. Nor did the animosity of <lb/>
            the chiefs, meanwhile, abate. Attains despatched some of his <lb/>
            men to assassinate Perdiccas, the leader of the opposite party, <lb/>
            but, as he was armed, the assassins durst not go near him, <lb/>
            though he freely invited them to approach; and such was <lb/>
            the resolution of Perdiccas, that he went of his own ac­ <lb/>
            cord to the infantry, and, summoning them to an assembly, <lb/>
            represented to them the atrocity of their conduct; admonish­ <lb/>
            ing them " to consider against whom they had taken arms; <lb/>
            that they were not Persians, but Macedonians ; not enemies, <lb/>
            but their own countrymen; most of them their kinsmen, but <lb/>
            certainly all of them their fellow soldiers, sharers of the same <lb/>
            camp and of the same dangers; that they would present a <lb/>
            striking spectacle to their enemies, who would rejoice at the <lb/>
            mutual slaughter of those by whose arms they grieved at <lb/>
            having been conquered; and that they would atone with their <lb/>
            own blood to the manes of their slaughtered adversaries."</p>
          <p>IV. Perdiccas having enforced these arguments with elo­ <lb/>
            quence peculiar to himself, produced such an effect upon the <lb/>
            infantry, that his admonitions were obeyed, and he was <lb/>
            unanimously chosen general. The cavalry, soon after, being <lb/>
            reconciled with the infantry, agreed to have Aridæus for <lb/>
            their king. A portion of the empire was reserved for Alexan­ <lb/>
            der's son, if a son should be born. These proceedings they <lb/>
            conducted with the body of Alexander placed in the midst of <lb/>
            them, that his majesty might be witness to their resolutions. <lb/>
            Such an arrangement being made, Antipater was appointed <lb/>
            governor of Macedonia and Greece; the charge of the royal <lb/>
            treasure was given to Craterus; the management of the camp, <lb/>
            the army, and the war, to Meleager and Perdiccas; and king <lb/>
            Aridæus was commissioned to convey the body of Alexander to <lb/>
            the temple of Jupiter Ammon. Perdiccas, who was still <lb/>
            enraged at the authors of the late disturbance, suddenly gave <lb/>
            notice, without the knowledge of his colleague, that there <pb n="125"/>
            <note type="margin"> B.C. 322.] </note> <lb/>
            would be a lustration of the camp on the following day on <lb/>
            account of the king's death. Having drawn up the troops <lb/>
            under arms in the field, he, with the general consent, gave <lb/>
            orders, as he passed along, that the offenders, selected from <lb/>
            each company, should be secretly given up to punishment. <lb/>
            On his return, he divided the provinces among the chief men, <lb/>
            in order both to remove his rivals out of the way, and to make <lb/>
            the gift of a prefectship appear a favour from himself. In the <lb/>
            first place Egypt, with part of Africa and Arabia, fell by lot to <lb/>
            Ptolemy, whom Alexander, for his merit, had raised from the <lb/>
            condition of a common soldier; and Cleomenes, who had built <lb/>
            Alexandria,* was directed to put the province into his hands. <lb/>
            Laomedon of Mitylene was allotted Syria, which bordered on <lb/>
            Ptolemy's province; Philotas, Cilicia; and Philo, Illyria. <lb/>
            Atropatus was set over the Greater Media; the father-in-law of <lb/>
            Perdiccas over the Less. Susiana was assigned to Scynus, <lb/>
            and the Greater Phrygia to Antigonus, the son of Philip. <lb/>
            Nearchus received Lycia and Pamphylia; Cassander, Caria; <lb/>
            and Menander, Lydia. The Lesser Phrygia fell to Leonatus <lb/>
            Thrace, and the coasts of the Pontic sea, to Lysimachus; <lb/>
            Cappadocia and Paphlagonia were given to Eumenes. The <lb/>
            chief command of the camp fell to Seleucus the son of Anti­ <lb/>
            ochus. Cassander, the son of Antipater, was made commander <lb/>
            of the king's guards and attendants. In Ulterior Bactriana, <lb/>
            and the countries of India, the present governors were allowed <lb/>
            to retain their office. The region between the rivers Hydas­ <lb/>
            pes and Indus, Taxiles received. To the colonies settled in <lb/>
            India, Python, the son of Agenor, was sent. Of Paropa­ <lb/>
            misia, and the borders of mount Caucasus, Extarches had the <lb/>
            command. The Arachosians and Gedrosians were assigned to <lb/>
            Sibyrtius; the Drancæ and Arci to Stasanor. Amyntas was <lb/>
            allotted the Bactrians, Scythæus the Sogdians, Nicanor the <lb/>
            Parthians, Philippus the Hyrcanians, Phrataphernes the <lb/>
            Armenians, Tleptolemus the Persians, Peucestes the Baby­ <lb/>
            lonians, Archon the Pelasgians, Arcesilaus, Mesopotamia. <lb/>
            When this allotment, like a gift from the fates, was made to <note type="footnote"> * Cleomenes had indeed authority in Africa and Europe, but it <lb/>
            was only over the revenues ; and it was not he that built Alexandria, <lb/>

            each, it was to many of them a great occasion for improving <lb/>
            their fortunes ; for not long after, as if they had divided king­ <lb/>
            doms, not governments, among themselves, they became <lb/>
            princes instead of prefects, and not only secured great power <lb/>
            to themselves, but bequeathed it to their descendants.</p>
          <p>V. While these transactions were passing in the east, the <lb/>
            Athenians and Ætolians proceeded with all their might to <lb/>
            prosecute the war which they had begun in the life of Alexander. <lb/>
            The cause of the war was, that Alexander, on his return from <lb/>
            India, had written certain letters to Greece, according to which <lb/>
            the exiles from all the states, except such as had been convicted <lb/>
            of murder, were to be recalled. These letters, being read <lb/>
            before all Greece, assembled at the Olympic games,- had <lb/>
            excited a great commotion ; because many had been banished, <lb/>
            not by legal authority, but by a faction of the leading men, <lb/>
            who were afraid that, if they were recalled, they would become <lb/>
            more powerful in their states than themselves. Many states <lb/>
            therefore at once expressed open discontent, and said that <lb/>
            their liberty must be secured by force of arms. The leaders <lb/>
            among them all, however, were the Athenians and Ætolians.</p>
          <p>This being reported to Alexander, he gave orders that a <lb/>
            thousand ships of war should be raised among his allies, with <lb/>
            which he might carry on war in the west; and he intended to <lb/>
            make an expedition, with a powerful force, to level Athens with <lb/>
            the ground. The Athenians, in consequence, collecting an <lb/>
            army of thirty thousand men and two hundred ships, went <lb/>
            to war with Antipater, to whom the government of Greece had <lb/>
            been assigned; and when he declined to come to battle, and <lb/>
            sheltered himself within the walls of Heraclea, they besieged <lb/>
            him there. At that time Demosthenes, the Athenian orator, <lb/>
            who had been banished from his country on the charge of <lb/>
            taking gold from Harpalus (a man who had fled from Alex­ <lb/>
            ander's severity), bribing him to prevail on the city t to go to <lb/>
            war with Alexander, happened then to be living in exile at <lb/>
            Megara, and learning that Hyperides was sent as an ambassa­ <lb/>
            dor by the Athenians to persuade the Peloponnesians to join <note type="footnote"> * In mercer Olympiaco.] " For at those games," says Pythagoras in <lb/>

            in the war, followed him, and, by his eloquence, brought over <lb/>
            Sicyon, Argos, Corinth, and other states, to the Athenian <lb/>
            interest. For this service a ship was sent for him by the <lb/>
            Athenians, and he was recalled from banishment. Meanwhile <lb/>
            Leosthenes, the general of the Athenians, was killed, while he <lb/>
            was besieging Antipater, by a dart hurled at him from the <lb/>
            wall as he was passing by. This occurrence gave so much <lb/>
            encouragement to Antipater, that he ventured to break down <lb/>
            the Athenian rampart. He then sought assistance from <lb/>
            Leonatus, who was soon reported to be approaching with his <lb/>
            army; but the Athenians met him in battle array, and he was <lb/>
            severely wounded in an action of the cavalry, and died. <lb/>
            Antipater, though he saw his auxiliaries defeated, was yet <lb/>
            rejoiced at the death of Leonatus, congratulating himself that <lb/>
            his rival was taken off, and his force added to his own. Taking <lb/>
            Leonatus's army under his command, therefore, and thinking <lb/>
            himself a match for the enemy, even in a regular battle, he <lb/>
            immediately released himself from the siege, and marched <lb/>
            away to Macedonia. The forces of the Greeks, too, having <lb/>
            driven the enemy * from the territory of Greece, went off to <lb/>
            their several cities.</p>
          <p>VI. Perdiccas, in the meantime, making war upon Ariara­ <lb/>
            thes, king of the Cappadocians, defeated him in a pitched <lb/>
            battle, but got no other reward for his efforts but wounds and <lb/>
            perils ; for the enemy, retreating from the field into the city, <lb/>
            killed each his own wife and children, and set fire to his house <lb/>
            and all that he possessed ; throwing their slaves too into the <lb/>
            flames, and afterwards themselves, that the victorious enemy <lb/>
            might enjoy nothing belonging to them but the sight of the <lb/>
            conflagration that they had kindled. Soon after, that he <lb/>
            might secure royal support to his present power, he turned <lb/>
            his thoughts to a marriage with Cleopatra, sister of Alexander <lb/>
            the Great, and formerly wife of the other Alexander,† <lb/>
            her mother Olympias showing no dislike to the match. But <lb/>
            he wished first to outwit Antipater, by pretending a desire for <lb/>
            an alliance with him, and therefore made a feint of asking his <lb/>
            daughter in marriage, the more easily to procure from him <lb/>
            young recruits from Macedonia. Antipater, however, seeing <note type="footnote"> * Pulto hoste.] The word pulso is inconsistent with what is said just <lb/>
            above, that the enemy " marched away," concessit, of their own accord. </note><note type="footnote"> t Alexander of Epirus. See ix. 6. </note> <pb n="128"/>

            through his deceit, he courted two wives at once, but obtained <lb/>
            neither.</p>
          <p>Afterwards a war arose between Antigonus and Perdiccas; <lb/>
            Craterus and Antipater (who, having made peace with the <lb/>
            Athenians, had appointed Polysperchon to govern Greece and <lb/>
            Macedonia) lent their aid to Antigonus. Perdiccas, as the <lb/>
            aspect of affairs was unfavourable, called Aridæus, and Alex­ <lb/>
            ander the Great's son,* then in Cappadocia (the charge of <lb/>
            both of whom had been committed to him), to a consultation <lb/>
            concerning the management of the war. Some were of <lb/>
            opinion that it should be transferred to Macedonia, to the very <lb/>
            head and metropolis of the kingdom, where Olympias, the <lb/>
            mother of Alexander, was, who would be no small support to <lb/>
            their party, while the good will of their countrymen would be <lb/>
            with them, from respect to the names of Alexander and <lb/>
            Philip; but it seemed more to the purpose to begin with <lb/>
            Egypt, lest, while they were gone into Macedonia, Asia should <lb/>
            be seized by Ptolemy. Paphlagonia, Caria, Lycia, and <lb/>
            Phrygia were assigned to Eumenes, in addition to the provinces <lb/>
            which he had already received; and he was directed to wait <lb/>
            in those parts for Craterus and Antipater, Alcetas, the brother <lb/>
            of Perdiccas, and Neoptolemus being appointed to support <lb/>
            him with their forces. The command of the fleet was given <lb/>
            to Clitua. Cilicia, being taken from Philotas, was given to <lb/>
            Philoxenus. Perdiccas himself set out for Egypt with a large <lb/>
            army. Thus Macedonia, while its commanders separated into <lb/>
            two parties, was armed against its own vitals, and turned the <lb/>
            sword from warring against the enemy to the effusion of civil <lb/>
            blood, being ready, like people in a fit of madness, to hack her <lb/>
            own hands and limbs. But Ptolemy, by his wise exertions in <lb/>
            Egypt, was acquiring great power; he had secured the favour <lb/>
            of the Egyptians by his extraordinary prudence; he had <lb/>
            attached the neighbouring princes by acts of kindness and <lb/>
            courtesy ; he had extended the boundaries of his kingdom by <lb/>
            getting possession of the city Cyrene, and was grown so great <lb/>
            that he did not fear his enemies so much as he was feared by <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>VII. Cyrene was founded by Aristæus, who, from being <lb/>
            tongue-tied, was also called Battus. His father Grinus, king of <note type="footnote"> * His posthumous son by Roxane, called Alexander Acus. See xii. <lb/>

            the isle of Them, having gone to the oracle at Delphi, to <lb/>
            implore the god to remove the ignominy of his son, who was <lb/>
            grown up but could not speak, received an answer by which his <lb/>
            son Battus was directed “ to go to Africa, and found the city <lb/>
            of Cyrene, where he would gain the use of his tongue." This <lb/>
            response appearing but a jest, by reason of the paucity of inha­ <lb/>
            bitants in the island of Them, from which a colony was desired <lb/>
            to go to build a city in a country of such vast extent as Africa, <lb/>
            the matter was neglected. Some time after, the Tberans, as <lb/>
            being guilty of disobedience, were forced by a pestilence to <lb/>
            comply with the god's directions. But the number of the <lb/>
            colonists was so extremely small that they scarcely filled one <lb/>
            ship. Arriving in Africa, they dislodged the inhabitants from <lb/>
            a hill named Cyras, and took possession of it for themselves, <lb/>
            on account both of the pleasantness of the situation and the <lb/>
            abundance of springs in it. Here Battus, their leader, the <lb/>
            strings of his tongue being loosed, began to speak; which <lb/>
            circumstance, as one part of the god's promises was fulfilled, <lb/>
            gave them encouragement to entertain the further hope of <lb/>
            building a city. Pitching their camp, accordingly, they <lb/>
            received information of an old tradition, that Cyrene, a maiden <lb/>
            of extraordinary beauty, was carried off by Apollo from Pelion, <lb/>
            a mountain in Thessaly, and brought to that very mountain <lb/>
            on which they had seized a hill, where, becoming pregnant by <lb/>
            the god, she brought forth four sons, Nomius, Aristæus, <lb/>
            Authocus, and Argaeus; and that a party being sent by her <lb/>
            father Hypsæus, king of Thessaly, to seek for the damsel, <lb/>
            were so attracted by the charms of the place, that they settled <lb/>
            there with her. Of her four sons, it was said that three, <lb/>
            when they grew up, returned to Thessaly, and inherited their <lb/>
            grandfather's kingdom; and that the fourth, Aristæus, reigned <lb/>
            over a great part of Arcadia, and taught mankind the <lb/>
            management of bees and honey, and the art of making cheese, <lb/>
            and was the first that observed the solstitial risings of Sirius.* <lb/>
            On hearing this account, Battus built the city in obedience <note type="footnote"> * Solstitiales ortus sideris.] Aristaeus first observed the risings of <lb/>
            Sirius or the dog-star, and taught the Ceans to watch them and <lb/>

            with it, I think that we should read solstitialisortus sideris. By solsti­ <lb/>

          <p>VIII. Ptolemy, having increased his strength from the <lb/>
            forces of this city, made preparations for war against the <lb/>
            coming of Perdiccas. But the hatred which Perdiccas had <lb/>
            incurred by his arrogance did him more injury than the power <lb/>
            of the enemy; for his allies, detesting his overbearingness, <lb/>
            went over in troops to Antipater. Neoptolemus, too, who had <lb/>
            been left to support Eumenes, intended not only to desert <lb/>
            himself, but also to betray the force of his party; when <lb/>
            Eumenes, understanding his design, thought it a matter of <lb/>
            necessity to engage the traitor in the field. Neoptolemus, <lb/>
            being worsted, fled to Antipater and Polysperchon, and per­ <lb/>
            suaded them to surprise Eumenes, by marching without inter­ <lb/>
            mission, while he was full of joy for his victory, and freed <lb/>
            from apprehension by his own flight. But this project did <lb/>
            not escape Eumenes; the plot was in consequence turned <lb/>
            upon the contrivers of it; and they who expected to attack <lb/>
            him unguarded, were attacked themselves when they were on <lb/>
            their march, and wearied with watching through the previous <lb/>
            night. In this battle, Polysperchon was killed. t Neoptolemus, <lb/>
            too, engaging hand to hand with Eumenes, and maintaining a <lb/>
            long struggle with him, in which both were wounded more than <lb/>
            once, was at last overpowered and fell. Eumenes, therefore, <lb/>
            being victorious in two successive battles, supported in some <lb/>
            degree the spirits of his party, which had been cast down by <lb/>
            the desertion of their allies. At last, however, Perdiccas <lb/>
            being killed,‡ Eumenes was declared an enemy by the army <lb/>
            together with Pitho, Illyrius, and Alcetas, the brother of Per­ <lb/>
            diccas ; and the conduct of the war against them was com­ <lb/>

          <p>I. WHEN Eumenes found that Perdiccas was slain, that he <lb/>
            himself was declared an enemy by the Macedonians, and that <lb/>
            the conduct of the war against him was committed to Anti­ <lb/>
            gonus, he at once made known the state of affairs to his <lb/>
            troops, lest report should either exaggerate matters, or alarm <lb/>
            the minds of the men with the unexpected nature of the <lb/>
            events; designing at the same time to learn how they, were <lb/>
            affected towards him, and to take his measures according to. <lb/>
            the feeling expressed by them as a body. He boldly gave <lb/>
            notice, however, that “ if any one of them felt dismayed at <lb/>
            the news, he had full liberty to depart.” By. this declaration <lb/>
            he so strongly attached them to his side, that they all imme­ <lb/>
            diately exhorted him to prosecute the war, and protested that <lb/>
            “ they would annul the decrees of the Macedonians with their <lb/>
            swords." Having then led his army into Ætolia,* he exacted <lb/>
            contributions from the different cities, and plundered, like an <lb/>
            enemy, such as refused to pay. Next he went to Sardis, to <lb/>
            Cleopatra, the sister of Alexander the Great, that with her <lb/>
            influence he might encourage his captains and chief officers, <lb/>
            who would think that the royal authority was on that side on, <lb/>
            which the sister of Alexander stood. Such veneration was <lb/>
            there for the greatness of Alexander, that the influence of his. <lb/>
            sacred name was sought even by means of women.</p>
          <p>When he returned to his camp, letters were found scattered: <lb/>
            through it, in which great rewards were offered to any that <lb/>
            should bring the head of Eumenes to Antigonus. This <lb/>
            coming to his knowledge, Eumenes, assembling his men, first <lb/>
            offered them his congratulations that " none had been found. <note type="footnote"> * So stands the name in Wetzel's text, and in most others, except <lb/>
            that of Tauchnitz, which has Æolia, the conjecture of Glareanus. <lb/>
            But Isaac Vossius conjectures Ætulane, from a passage of Ptolemy, <lb/>
            who gives that name to a part of Armenia Minor, lying to the north-east <lb/>
            of Cappadocia. Vossius's suggestion is approved by Vorstius and Faber </note> <note type="footnote"> K 2 </note> <pb n="132"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.XIV. CH.II. </note> <lb/>
            among them who preferred the expectation of a reward stained <lb/>
            with blood to the obligation of his military oath." He then <lb/>
            craftily added that these letters had been forged by himself to <lb/>
            sound their feelings; but that his life was in the hands of <lb/>
            them all; and that neither Antigonus nor any other general <lb/>
            would be willing to conquer by such means as would afford <lb/>
            the worst of examples against himself." By acting thus, he <lb/>
            both preserved for the present the attachment of such as were <lb/>
            wavering, and made it likely that if anything similar should <lb/>
            happen in future, the soldiers would think that they were not <lb/>
            tampered with by the enemy, but sounded by their own general. <lb/>
            All of them in consequence zealously offered him their services <lb/>
            for the guard of his person.</p>
          <p>II. In the meantime Antigonus came up with his army, <lb/>
            and having pitched his camp, offered battle on the following <lb/>
            day. Nor did Eumenes delay to engage with him; but, <lb/>
            being defeated, he fled to a fortress, where, when he saw that <lb/>
            he must submit to the hazard of a siege, he dismissed the <lb/>
            greater part of his army, lest he should either be delivered to <lb/>
            the enemy by consent of the multitude, or the sufferings of the <lb/>
            siege should be aggravated by too great a number. He then <lb/>
            sent a deputation to Antipater, who was the only general that <lb/>
            seemed a match for the power of Antigonus, to entreat his aid; <lb/>
            and Antigonus, hearing that succour was despatched by him to <lb/>
            Eumenes, gave up the siege. Eumenes was thus for a time, <lb/>
            indeed, relieved from fear of death; but, as so great a portion <lb/>
            of his army was sent away, he had no great hope of ultimate <lb/>
            safety. After taking everything into consideration, therefore, <lb/>
            he thought it best to apply to the Argyraspides of Alexander <lb/>
            the Great, a body of men that had never yet been conquered, and <lb/>
            radiant with the glory of so many victories. But the Argyras­ <lb/>
            pides disdained all leaders in comparison with Alexander, and <lb/>
            thought service under other generals dishonourable to the <lb/>
            memory of so great a monarch. Eumenes had, therefore, to <lb/>
            address them with flattery; he spoke to each of them in the <lb/>
            language of a suppliant, calling them his " fellow-soldiers," <lb/>
            his “ patrons," or his " companions in the dangers and exploits <lb/>
            of the east; " sometimes styling them “ his refuge for pro­ <lb/>
            tection, and his only security;" saying that “they were <lb/>
            the only troops by whose valour the east had been subdued, <lb/>
            the only troops that had gone beyond the achievements of <pb n="133"/>
            <note type="margin"> B.C. 315.] </note> <lb/>
            Bacchus and the monuments of Hercules; that by them <lb/>
            Alexander had become great, by them had attained divine <lb/>
            honours and immortal glory; " and he begged them “ to <lb/>
            receive him, not so much in the character of a general, as in <lb/>
            that of a fellow-soldier, and to allow him to be one of their <lb/>
            body." Being received on these terms, he gradually sue. <lb/>
            ceeded, first by giving them hints individually, and afterwards <lb/>
            by gently correcting whatever was done amiss, in gaining the <lb/>
            sole command. Nothing could be done in the camp without <lb/>
            him;nothing managed without the aid of his judgment.</p>
          <p>III. At length, when it was announced that Antigonus was <lb/>
            approaching with his army, he obliged them to march into the <lb/>
            field; where, slighting the orders of their general, they were <lb/>
            defeated by the bravery of the enemy. In this battle they <lb/>
            lost, with their wives and children, not only their glory from <lb/>
            -so many wars, but also the booty obtained in their long service. <lb/>
            But Eumenes, who was the cause of their disaster,. and had <lb/>
            no other hope of safety remaining, encouraged them after their <lb/>
            repulse, assuring them that" they had the superiority in courage, <lb/>
            ,as five thousand of the enemy had been slain by them ; and <lb/>
            that if they persevered in the war, their enemies would gladly <lb/>
            sue for peace; " adding, that " the losses, by which they esti­ <lb/>
            mated their defeat, were two thousand women, and a few chil- <lb/>
            Aren and slaves, which they might better recover by conquering, <lb/>
            than by yielding the victory." The Argyraspides, on the other <lb/>
            hand, declared that “ they would neither attempt a retreat, <lb/>
            after the loss of their property and wives, nor would they war <lb/>
            .against their own children,”† and pursued him with reproaches <lb/>
            “ for having involved them, when they were returning home <lb/>
            after so many years of completed service, and with the fruits <lb/>
            of so many enterprises, and when on the point of being <lb/>
            disbanded, in fresh efforts and vast struggles in the field; for <lb/>
            laving deluded them, when they were recalled, as it were, <lb/>
            from their own hearths, and from the very threshold of their <lb/>
            country, with vain promises; and for not allowing them, after <lb/>
            having lost all the gains of their fortunate service, to support <lb/>
            quietly under their defeat the burden of a poor and unhappy <note type="footnote"> * Auctor cladis.] Inasmuch as he had impelled them to take the <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B.XIV. CH.IV. </note> <lb/>
            old age." Immediately after, without the knowledge of their <lb/>
            leaders,* they sent deputies to Antigonus, requesting that “ he <lb/>
            would order what was theirs t to be restored to them." Anti­ <lb/>
            gonus promised that "he would restore what they asked, if <lb/>
            they would deliver up Eumenes to him." Hearing of this <lb/>
            reply, Eumenes, with a few others, attempted to flee, but <lb/>
            being brought back, and finding his condition desperate, he <lb/>
            requested, as a great crowd gathered around him, to be allowed <lb/>
            to address the army for the last time.</p>
          <p>IV. Being desired by them all to speak, and silence being <lb/>
            made, and his chains loosed, he held out his hand, fettered as <lb/>
            he was, and said, "Soldiers, ye behold the dress and equip­ <lb/>
            ments of your general, which it is not any one of the enemy <lb/>
            that has put upon me; for that would be even a consolation <lb/>
            to me; but it is you that have made me of a conqueror con­ <lb/>
            quered, and of a general a prisoner. Four times ‡ within the <lb/>
            present year have you bound yourselves by oath to obey me ; <lb/>
            but on that point I shall say nothing, for reproaches do not <lb/>
            become the unfortunate. One favour only I entreat, that, if <lb/>
            the performance of Antigonus's promises depends on my life, <lb/>
            you would allow me to die among yourselves; for to him it <lb/>
            signifies nothing how or where I fall, and I shall be delivered <lb/>
            from an ignominious end. If I obtain this request, I release <lb/>
            you from the oath by which you have so often devoted your­ <lb/>
            selves to me. Or if you are ashamed to offer violence to me <lb/>
            at my entreaty, give me a sword, and permit your general to <lb/>
            do for you,§ without the obligation of an oath, that which you <lb/>
            have taken an oath to do for your general." Not being able, <lb/>
            however, to obtain his request, he changed his tone of entreaty <lb/>
            to that of anger, and exclaimed, “ May the gods, then, the <lb/>
            avengers of perjury, look down in judgment upon you, ye <lb/>
            accursed wretches, and bring upon you such deaths as you have <lb/>
            brought upon your leaders. It was you, the same who now <lb/>
            stand before me, that were lately sprinkled with the blood of <note type="footnote"> * Eumenes, and those who adhered to him; those few with whom <lb/>

            Perdiccas, and that planned a similar end for Antipater. You <lb/>
            would even have killed Alexander himself, if it had been pos­ <lb/>

            tions : may you live your whole lives in poverty, far from your <lb/>
            country, in this camp where you are exiled; and may your own <lb/>
            arms, by which you have killed more generals of your own than <lb/>
            of your enemies, sink you in utter destruction." Then, full of <lb/>
            indignation, he began to walk before his guards towards the <lb/>
            camp of Antigonus. The army followed, surrendering their <lb/>
            general, and being themselves made prisoners; and, leading up <lb/>
            a triumph over themselves to the camp of their conqueror, <lb/>
            resigned to him, together with their own persons, all their <lb/>
            honour gained under king Alexander,‡ and the palms and <lb/>
            laurels of so long a warfare; and, that nothing might be <lb/>
            wanting to the procession, the elephants and auxiliaries of the <lb/>
            east§ brought up the rear. This single victory was so far more <lb/>
            glorious to Antigonus than so many other victories had been to <lb/>
            Alexander, that whereas Alexander subdued the east, Anti­ <lb/>
            gonus defeated those by whom the east had been subdued. <lb/>
            These conquerors of the world, then, Antigonus distributed <lb/>
            among his army, restoring to them what he had taken in the <lb/>
            victory; and directed that Eumenes, whom, from regard to <lb/>
            their former friendship, he did not allow to come into his pre­ <lb/>
            sence, should be committed to the care of a guard.</p>
          <p>V. In the meantime Eurydice, the wife of king Aridæus, <lb/>
            when she learned that Polysperchon was returning from Greece <lb/>
            into Macedonia, and that Olympias was sent for by him, being <lb/>
            prompted by a womanish emulation, and taking advantage of <lb/>
            her husband s weakness, whose duties she took upon herself, <lb/>
            wrote in the king's name to Polysperchon, desiring him “to <lb/>
            deliver up the army to Cassander, on whom the king had con <lb/>
            ferred the government of the kingdom." She made a similar <note type="footnote"> * This is quite at variance with Justin's account of Alexander's <lb/>

            communication to Antigonus, in a letter which she wrote to him <lb/>
            in Asia. Cassander, attached to her by such a favour, managed <lb/>
            everything according to the will of that ambitious woman. <lb/>
            Marching into Greece, he made war upon several cities; by <lb/>
            the calamities of which, as by a fire in the neighbourhood, the <lb/>
            Spartans were alarmed, and, distrusting their power in arms. <lb/>
            enclosed their city (which they had always defended, not with <lb/>
            walls, but with their swords) with works of defence, in disre­ <lb/>
            gard both of the predictions of the oracles, and of the ancient <lb/>
            glory of their forefathers. Strange, that they should have so <lb/>
            far degenerated from their ancestors, that, when the valour of <lb/>
            the citizens had been for many ages a wall to the city, the <lb/>
            citizens could not now think themselves secure unless they had <lb/>
            walls to shelter them. But during the course of these pro­ <lb/>
            ceedings, the disturbed state of Macedonia obliged Cassander <lb/>
            to return home from Greece; for Olympias, the mother of <lb/>
            Alexander the Great, coming from Epirus to Macedonia, with <lb/>
            Æacides, king of the Molossians, attending her, and being <lb/>
            forbidden to enter the country by Eurydice and king Aridæus, <lb/>
            the Macedonians being moved, either by respect for the <lb/>
            memory of her husband, or the greatness of her son, or by the <lb/>
            indignity with which she was treated, went over to Olympias, <lb/>
            by whose order both Eurydice and the king were put to death, <lb/>
            he having held the kingdom six years since the decease of <lb/>
            Alexander.</p>
          <p>VI. But neither did Olympias reign long; for having com­ <lb/>
            mitted great slaughter among the nobility throughout the <lb/>
            country, like a furious woman rather than a queen, she turned <lb/>
            the favour with which she was regarded into hatred. Hearing, <lb/>
            therefore, of the approach of Cassander, and distrusting the Mace­ <lb/>
            donians, she retired, with her daughter in-law Roxane, and her <lb/>
            grandson Hercules, to the city of Pydna. Deidamia, the daugh­ <lb/>
            ter of king Æacides, and Thessalonice, her step-daughter, ren­ <lb/>
            dered illustrious by the name of Philip, who was her father, and <lb/>
            many others, wives of the leading men, a retinue showy rather <lb/>
            than serviceable, attended her on her journey. When the <lb/>
            news of her retreat was brought to Cassander, he marched <lb/>
            immediately, with the utmost expedition, to Pydna, and laid <lb/>
            siege to the city. Olympias, distressed with famine and <lb/>
            the sword, and the wearisomeness of a long siege, surrendered <lb/>
            herself to the conqueror, stipulating only for life. But Cas- <pb n="137"/>

            sander, on summoning the people to an assembly, to inquire <lb/>
            “ what they would wish to be done with Olympias," induced <lb/>
            the parents of those whom she had killed to put on mourn­ <lb/>
            ing apparel, and expose her cruelties; when the Mace­ <lb/>
            donians, exasperated by their statements, decreed, without <lb/>
            regard to her former majesty, that she should be put to death; <lb/>
            utterly unmindful that, by the labours of her son and her hus­ <lb/>
            band, they had not only lived in security among their neigh­ <lb/>
            bours, but had attained to vast power, and even to the conquest <lb/>
            of the world. Olympias, seeing armed men advancing towards <lb/>
            her, bent upon her destruction, went voluntarily to meet them, <lb/>
            dressed in her regal apparel, and leaning on two of her maids. <lb/>
            The executioners, on beholding her, struck with the recollection <lb/>
            of her former royal dignity,. and with the names of so many of <lb/>
            their kings, that occurred to their memory in connexion with <lb/>
            her, stood still, until others were sent by Cassander to despatch <lb/>
            her; she, at the same time, not shrinking from the sword or <lb/>
            the blow, or crying out like a woman, but submitting to death <lb/>

            Account of Seleucus ; of Sandrocottus; death of Antigonus, IV.</p>
          <p>I. PERDICCAS and his brother, with Eumenes and <lb/>
            Polysperchon, and other leaders of the opposite party, being <lb/>
            killed, the contention among the successors of Alexander <lb/>
            seemed to be at an end; when, on a sudden, a dispute arose <lb/>
            among the conquerors themselves; for Ptolemy, Cassander, <lb/>
            and Lysimachus, demanding that “ the money taken amongst <lb/>
            the spoil, and the provinces, should be divided," Antigonus <lb/>
            said that “ he would admit no partners in the advantages of a <lb/>
            war of which he alone had undergone the perils." And that <lb/>
            he might seem to engage in an honourable contest with his <lb/>
            confederates, he gave out that “ his object was to avenge the <lb/>
            death of Olympia.,;, who had been murdered by Cassander, and <lb/>
            to release the son of Alexander, his king, with his mother, <lb/>
            from their confinement at Amphipolis." On hearing this <lb/>
            news, Ptolemy and Cassander, forming an alliance with <lb/>
            Lysimachus and Seleucus, made vigorous preparations for war <lb/>
            by land and sea. Ptolemy had possession of Egypt, with the <lb/>
            greater part of Africa, Cyprus, and Phœnicia. Macedonia and <lb/>
            Greece were subject to Cassander. Antigonus had taken <lb/>
            possession of Asia and the eastern countries.</p>
          <p>Demetrius, the son of Antigonus, was defeated in the first <lb/>
            3ngagement by Ptolemy, at Gamala.* In this action, the <lb/>
            renown gained by Ptolemy for his moderation was greater <lb/>
            than that which he obtained from the victory itself; for he let <lb/>
            the friends of Demetrius depart, not only with their baggage, <lb/>
            but with presents in addition; and he restored Demetrius <lb/>
            himself all his private property, together with his family, <lb/>
            making, at the same time, this honourable declaration, that <lb/>
            "he had not engaged in the war for plunder, but for the <lb/>
            maintenance of his own character, being indignant that when <lb/>
            the leaders of the opposite faction were conquered, Antigonus <lb/>
            claimed the fruits of their common victory for himself."</p>
          <p>II. During these transactions, Cassander, returning from <note type="footnote"> * Near Gaza. Diod. Sic. xix. 84.— Wetzel. </note> <pb n="139"/>

            Apollonia, fell in with the Antariatæ,* who, having abandoned <lb/>
            their country on account of the vast number of frogs and mice <lb/>
            that infested it, were seeking a settlement. Fearing that <lb/>
            they might possess themselves of Macedonia, he made a <lb/>
            compact with them, received them as allies, and assigned <lb/>
            them lands at the extremity of the country. Afterwards, lest <lb/>
            Hercules, the son of Alexander, who had nearly completed <lb/>
            his fourteenth year, should be called to the throne Of <lb/>
            Macedonia through the influence of his father's name, he <lb/>
            sent secret orders that he should be put to death, together <lb/>
            with his mother Barsine, and that their bodies should be <lb/>
            privately buried in the earth lest the murder should be <lb/>
            betrayed by a regular funeral.t As if, too, he had previously <lb/>
            incurred but small guilt, first in the case of the king himself,‡ <lb/>
            and afterwards in that of his mother Olympias and her son, <lb/>
            he cut off his other son, and his mother Roxane, with <lb/>
            similar treachery; as though he could not obtain the throne <lb/>
            of Macedonia, to which he aspired, otherwise than by crime.</p>
          <p>Ptolemy meanwhile engaged a second time with Demetrius <lb/>
            at sea; § and, having lost his fleet, and left the victory to the <lb/>
            enemy, fled back to Egypt, whither Demetrius sent <lb/>
            Leontiscus, the son of Ptolemy, his brother Menelaus, and <lb/>
            his friends, with all their baggage, being induced to this act by <lb/>
            like kindness previously shown || to himself; and that it <lb/>
            might appear that they were stimulated, not by hatred, but by <lb/>
            desire of glory and honour, they vied with one another, even <lb/>
            amidst war itself, in kindnesses and services. So much more <note type="footnote"> * Wetzel, In his text, has the old reading A bderitas, but expresses <lb/>

            honourably were wars then conducted than private friend­ <lb/>
            ships are now maintained ! *</p>
          <p>Antigonus, being elated with this victory, gave orders that <lb/>
            he himself, as well as his son Demetrius, should be styled <lb/>
            king by the people. Ptolemy also, that he might not <lb/>
            appear of less authority among his subjects, was called king <lb/>
            by his army. Cassander and Lysimachus, too, when they <lb/>
            heard of these proceedings, assumed regal dignity themselves. <lb/>
            They all abstained, however, from taking the insignia of <lb/>
            royalty, as long as any sons of their king survived. Such <lb/>
            forbearance was there in them, that, though they had the <lb/>
            power, they yet contentedly remained without the distinction <lb/>
            of kings, while Alexander had a proper heir. But Ptolemy <lb/>
            and Cassander, and the other leaders of the opposite faction, <lb/>
            perceiving that they were individually weakened by Antigonus, <lb/>
            while each regarded the war, not as the common concern of all, <lb/>
            but as merely affecting himself, and all were unwilling to give <lb/>
            assistance to one another, as if victory would be only for one, <lb/>
            and not for all of them, appointed, after encouraging each <lb/>
            other by letters, a time and place for an interview, and <lb/>
            prepared for the contest with united strength. Cassander, <lb/>
            being unable to join in it, because of a war near home, <lb/>
            despatched Lysimachus to the support of his allies with a large <lb/>
            force.</p>
          <p>III. Lysimachus was of a noble family in Macedonia, but <lb/>
            was exalted far above any nobility of birth by the proofs which <lb/>
            he had given of personal merit, which was so great, that he <lb/>
            excelled all those by whom the east was conquered, in great­ <lb/>
            ness of mind, in philosophy, and in reputation for prowess. <lb/>
            For when Alexander the Great, in his anger, had pretended <lb/>
            that Callisthenes the philosopher, for his opposition to the <lb/>
            Persian mode of doing obeisance, was concerned in a plot that <lb/>
            had been formed against him, and, by cruelly mangling all his <lb/>
            limbs, and cutting off his ears, nose, and lips, had rendered <lb/>
            him a shocking and miserable spectacle, and had had him car­ <lb/>
            ried about, also, shut up in a cage with a dog, for a terror to <lb/>
            others, Lysimachus, who was accustomed to listen to Callis­ <lb/>
            thenes, and to receive precepts of virtue from him, took pity <note type="footnote"> * A foolish observation. Did Justin or Trogus suppose that friend­ <lb/>

            an so great a man, undergoing punishment, not for any crime, <lb/>
            but for freedom of speech,. and furnished him with poison to <lb/>
            relieve him from his misery. At this act Alexander was so <lb/>
            displeased, that he ordered Lysimachus to be exposed to a <lb/>
            fierce lion; but when the beast, furious at the sight of him, <lb/>
            had made a spring towards him, Lysimachus plunged his <lb/>
            hand, wrapped in his cloak, into the lion's mouth, and, seizing <lb/>
            fast hold of his tongue, killed him. This exploit being related <lb/>
            to the king, his wonder at it ended in pleasure, and he <lb/>
            regarded Lysimachus with more affection than before, on <lb/>
            account of his extraordinary bravery. Lysimachus, likewise, <lb/>
            endured the in-treatment of the king with magnanimity, as <lb/>
            that of a parent. At last, when all recollection of this affair <lb/>
            was effaced from the king's mind, Lysimachus was his only <lb/>
            attendant in an excursion through vast heaps of sand, when <lb/>
            he was in pursuit of some flying enemies, and had left his <lb/>
            guards behind him in consequence of the swiftness of his <lb/>
            horse. His brother Philip,† having previously attempted to <lb/>
            do him the same service, had expired in the king's arms. <lb/>
            Alexander, however, as he alighted from his horse, happened <lb/>
            to wound Lysimachus in the forehead with the point of his <lb/>
            spear, so severely that the blood could not by any means be <lb/>
            stopped, till the king, taking off his diadem, placed it on his <lb/>
            head by way of closing the wound; an act which was the first <lb/>
            omen of royal dignity to Lysimachus. And after the death of <lb/>
            Alexander, when the provinces were divided among his suc­ <lb/>
            cessors, the most warlike nations were assigned to Lysimachus <lb/>
            as the bravest of them all; so far, by general consent, had he <lb/>
            the pre-eminence over the rest in military merit.</p>
          <p>IV. Before the war with Antigonus was commenced by <lb/>
            Ptolemy and his allies, Seleucus, on a sudden, leaving the <lb/>
            Greater Asia,‡ came forward as a fresh enemy to Antigonus. <lb/>
            The merit of Seleucus was well known, and his birth had <lb/>
            been attended with extraordinary circumstances. His mother <lb/>
            Laodice, being married to Antiochus, a man of eminence <lb/>
            among Philip's generals, seemed to herself, in a dream, to <lb/>
            nave conceived from a union with Apollo, and, after becoming <note type="footnote">* Libertatus.] Libertas pro libertate Zoquendi.Sic sæpe et alii. <lb/>

            pliance, a. ring, on the stone of which was engraved an anchor, <lb/>
            and which she was desired to give to the child that she should <lb/>
            bring forth. A ring similarly engraved, which was found the <lb/>
            next day in the bed, and the figure of an anchor, which was <lb/>
            visible on the thigh of Seleucus when he was born, made this <lb/>
            dream extremely remarkable. This ring Laodice gave to <lb/>
            Seleucus, when he was going with Alexander to the Persian <lb/>
            war, informing him, at the same time, of his paternity. After <lb/>
            the death of Alexander, having secured dominion in the east, <lb/>
            he built a city, where he established a memorial of- his two­ <lb/>
            fold origin; for he called the city Antioch from the name of <lb/>
            his father Antiochus, and consecrated the plains near the city <lb/>
            to Apollo. This mark of his paternity continued also among <lb/>
            his descendants; for his sons and grandsons had an anchor <lb/>
            on their thigh; as a natural proof of their extraction.</p>
          <p>After the division of the Macedonian empire among the <lb/>
            followers of Alexander, he carried on several wars in the east. <lb/>
            He first took Babylon, and then, his strength being increased <lb/>
            by this success, subdued the Bactrians. He next made an <lb/>
            expedition into India; which, after the death of Alexander, had <lb/>
            shaken, as it were, the yoke of servitude from its neck, and <lb/>
            put his governors to death. The author of this liberation was <lb/>
            Sandrocottus, who afterwards, however, turned their semblance <lb/>
            of liberty into slavery; for, making himself king, he oppressed <lb/>
            the people whom he had delivered from a foreign power, with <lb/>
            a cruel tyranny. This man was of mean origin, but was <lb/>
            stimulated to aspire to regal power by supernatural encourage­ <lb/>
            ment; for, having offended Alexander by his boldness of <lb/>
            speech, and orders being given to kill him, he saved himseli <lb/>
            by swiftness of foot; and while he was lying asleep, after his <lb/>
            fatigue, a lion of great size having come up to him, licked oft <lb/>
            with his tongue the sweat that was running from him, and <lb/>
            after gently waking him, left him. Being first prompted by <lb/>
            this prodigy to conceive hopes of royal dignity, he drew <lb/>
            together a band of robbers, and solicited the Indians to sup­ <lb/>
            port his new sovereignty. Some time after, as he was going <lb/>
            to war with the generals of Alexander, a wild elephant -of <lb/>
            great bulk presented itself before him of its own accord, and, <lb/>
            as if tamed down to gentleness,* took him on its back, and <note type="footnote"> * Veluti domitâ mansuctudine atands in Wetzel's text, and I believe </note> <pb n="143"/>

            became his guide in the war, and conspicuous in fields of battle. <lb/>
            Sandrocottus, having thus acquired a throne, was in possession <lb/>
            of India, when Seleucus was laying the foundations of his <lb/>
            future greatness; who, after making a league with him, and <lb/>
            settling his affairs in the east, proceeded to join in the war <lb/>
            against Antigonus. As soon as the forces, therefore, of all <lb/>
            the confederates were united, a battle was fought,. in which <lb/>
            Antigonus was slain, and his son Demetrius put to flight.</p>
          <p>But the allied generals, after thus terminating the war with <lb/>
            the enemy, turned their arms again upon each other, and, as <lb/>
            they could not agree about the spoil, were divided into two <lb/>
            parties. Seleucus joined Demetrius, and Ptolemy Lysimachus. <lb/>
            Cassander dying, Philip, his son, succeeded him. Thus new <lb/>
            wars arose, as it were, from a fresh source, for Macedonia.</p>

            and that he had not contrived treachery, but prevented it; and <lb/>
            that he himself was the more rightful king of Macedonia, both <lb/>
            from experience attendant on greater age, and from other con <lb/>
            siderations; for that his father * had been a follower of king <lb/>
            Philip, and of Alexander the Great, in the whole of their wars, <lb/>
            and afterwards an attendant on the children of Alexander, <lb/>
            and a leader in the punishment of the revellers. That Anti <lb/>
            pater, on the other hand, the grandfather of these young men, <lb/>
            had always been more cruel as the governor of the kingdom <lb/>
            than the kings themselves; and that Cassander, their father, <lb/>
            had been the extirpator of the king's family, sparing neither <lb/>
            women nor children, and not resting till he bad cut off the <lb/>
            whole of the royal house. That vengeance for these crimes, <lb/>
            as he could not exact it from Cassander himself, had been <lb/>
            inflicted on his children; and that accordingly Philip and <lb/>
            Alexander, if the dead have any knowledge of human affairs, <lb/>
            would not wish the murderers of them and their issue, but <lb/>
            their avengers, to fill the throne of Macedonia." The people <lb/>
            being pacified by these arguments, he was saluted king of <lb/>
            Macedonia. Lysimachus, too, being pressed with a war with <lb/>
            Doricetes, king of Thrace, and not wishing to have to fight <lb/>
            with Demetrius at the same time, made peace with him, <lb/>
            resigning into his hands the other half of Macedonia, which <lb/>
            had fallen to the share of his son-in-law Antipater.</p>
          <p>II. When Demetrius, therefore, supported by the whole <lb/>
            strength of Macedonia, was preparing to invade Asia, Ptolemy, <lb/>
            Seleucus, and Lysimachus, having experienced in the former <lb/>
            contest how great the power of unanimity was, formed an <lb/>
            alliance a second time, and having joined their forces, carried <note type="footnote"> * Antigonus. </note> <pb n="145"/>
            <note type="margin"> B.C. 292.] </note> <lb/>
            the war against Demetrius, it to Europe. With these leaders <lb/>
            Pyrrhus, king of Epirus, united himself, as a friend and <lb/>
            sharer in the war, hoping that Demetrius might lose Mace <lb/>
            donia not less easily than he had obtained it. Nor were his <lb/>
            expectations vain; for he himself, having corrupted Deme <lb/>
            trius's army, and put him to flight, seized on the throne of <lb/>
            Macedonia.</p>
          <p>During the course of these transactions, Lysimachus put to <lb/>
            death his son-in-law Antipater, who complained that he had <lb/>
            been deprived of the throne of Macedonia by the treachery of <lb/>
            his father-in-law, and put his daughter Eurydice, who had <lb/>
            joined with him in his complaints, into prison ; and thus the <lb/>
            whole house of Cassander made atonement to Alexander the <lb/>
            Great, whether for killing himself or destroying his offspring, <lb/>
            partly by violent deaths, partly by other sufferings, and <lb/>
            partly by shedding the blood of one another.</p>
          <p>Demetrius, surrounded by so many armies, preferred, when <lb/>
            he might have fallen honourably, to make an ignominious <lb/>
            surrender to Seleucus. At the termination of the war died <lb/>
            Ptolemy, after having attained great glory by his military <lb/>
            exploits. Contrary to the custom among nations, he had <lb/>
            resigned his kingdom, before his illness, to the youngest of <lb/>
            .his sons, and had stated his reasons for that proceeding to the <lb/>
            people, who showed themselves no less indulgent in accepting <lb/>
            the son for their king than the father had proved himself in <lb/>
            delivering the kingdom to him. Among other instances of <lb/>
            mutual affection between the father and the son, the following <lb/>
            had procured the young man favour from the people, that the <lb/>
            father, having publicly resigned the throne to him, had done <lb/>
            duty as a private soldier among his guards, thinking it more <lb/>
            honour to be the father of a king than to possess any kingdom <lb/>
            whatsoever.</p>
          <p>III. But the evil of discord, constantly arising among <lb/>
            equals, had produced a war between Lysimachus and King <lb/>
            Pyrrhus, who had just before been allies against Demetrius. <lb/>
            Lysimachus, gaining the advantage, had expelled Pyrrhus, and <lb/>
            made himself master of Macedonia. He then made war on <lb/>
            Thrace, and afterwards on Heraclea, a city of which the <lb/>
            origin and the subsequent fortunes were objects of wonder; <lb/>
            for when the Bœotians were suffering from a pestilence, the <lb/>
            oracle at Delphi had told them, that " they must plant a <note type="footnote"> L </note> <pb n="146"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.XVI. CH.IV </note> <lb/>
            colony in the country of Pontus, dedicated to Hercules <lb/>
            But as, through dread of a long and dangerous voyage, <lb/>
            and all the people preferring death in their own country, the <lb/>
            matter was neglected, the Phocians made war upon them; <lb/>
            and after suffering from unsuccessful struggles with that <lb/>
            people, they had recourse to the oracle a second time. The <lb/>
            answer which they received was, that " what was a remedy <lb/>
            for the pestilence would also be a remedy for the war." <lb/>
            Raising therefore a body of colonists, and sailing to Pontus, <lb/>
            they built the city Heraclea ; and as they had been led to that <lb/>
            settlement by the guidance of fate, they soon acquired great <lb/>
            power. In process of time the city had many wars with its <lb/>
            neighbours, and many dissensions among its own people. <lb/>
            Among other noble acts that they performed, the following <lb/>
            is one of the most remarkable. When the Athenians were at <lb/>
            the height of power, and, after the overthrow of the Persians, <lb/>
            had imposed a tax on Greece and Asia for the support of a <lb/>
            fleet, and when all were promptly contributing to the main­ <lb/>
            tenance of their safety, the Heracleans alone, from friendship <lb/>
            for the kings of Persia, refused to pay. Lamachus was <lb/>
            accordingly despatched by the Athenians with an army to <lb/>
            exact from them what was withheld ; but leaving his ships on <lb/>
            the coast, and going to ravage the lands of the Heracleans, he <lb/>
            lost his fleet, with the greater part of his army, by shipwreck, <lb/>
            in a tempest that came on suddenly. As he was not able. <lb/>
            therefore, to return by sea, from having lost his ships, and <lb/>
            did not dare, with so small a body of men, to return by land <lb/>
            through so many warlike nations, the Heracleans, thinking <lb/>
            this a more honourable opportunity for kindness than for <lb/>
            revenge, sent the invaders away with a supply of provisions <lb/>
            and troops to protect them ; deeming the devastation of their <lb/>
            lands no loss, if they could but make those their friends who <lb/>
            had formerly been their enemies.</p>
          <p>IV. Among many other evils they endured also that of <lb/>
            tyranny; for when, on the populace violently clamouring for <lb/>
            an abolition of debts, and a division of the lands of the rich, <lb/>
            the subject was long discussed in the senate, and no settle­ <lb/>
            ment of it was devised, they at last sought assistance <lb/>
            against the commons, who were grown riotous by too long <lb/>
            idleness, from Timotheus general of the Athenians, and <lb/>
            afterwards from EDaminondas general of the Thebans. As <pb n="147"/>
             <note type="margin">B.C. ABOUT 550.] </note> <lb/>
            both, however, refused their request, they had recourse tc <lb/>
            Clearchus, whom they themselves had exiled ; such being tho <lb/>
            urgency of their distresses, that they recalled to the guardian <lb/>
            ship of his country him whom they had forbidden to enter <lb/>
            his country. But Clearchus, being rendered more desperate <lb/>
            by his banishment, and regarding the dissension among the <lb/>
            people as a means of securing to himself the government, first <lb/>
            sought a secret interview with Mithridates,* the enemy of his <lb/>
            countrymen, and made a league with him on the understanding <lb/>
            that when he was re-established in his country, he should, on <lb/>
            betraying the city into his hands, be made lieutenant-governor <lb/>
            of it. But the treachery which he had conceived against his <lb/>
            countrymen, he afterwards turned against Mithridates himself; <lb/>
            for on returning from banishment, to be as it were the arbiter <lb/>
            of the disputes in the city, he, at the time appointed for <lb/>
            delivering the town to Mithridates, made Mithridates himself <lb/>
            prisoner, with a party of his friends, and released him from <lb/>
            captivity only on the receipt of a large sum of money. <lb/>
            And as, in this case, he suddenly changed himself from a <lb/>
            friend into an enemy, so, in regard to his countrymen, he <lb/>
            soon, from a supporter of the senate's cause, became a patron <lb/>
            of the common people, and not only inflamed the populace <lb/>
            against those who had conferred his power upon him, and by <lb/>
            whom he had been recalled into his country and established <lb/>
            in the citadel, but even exercised upon his benefactors the <lb/>
            most atrocious inflictions of tyrannic cruelty. Summoning <lb/>
            the people to an assembly, he declared that " he would no <lb/>
            longer support the senate in their proceedings against the <lb/>
            populace, but would even interpose his authority, if they <lb/>
            persisted in their former severities; and that, if the people <lb/>
            thought themselves able to check the tyranny of the senate, <lb/>
            he would retire with his soldiers, and take no further part in <lb/>
            their dissensions ; but that, if they distrusted their ability to <lb/>
            make resistance, he would not be wanting to aid them in <lb/>
            taking revenge. They might therefore," he added, " deter­ <lb/>
            mine among themselves; they might bid him withdraw, if <lb/>
            they pleased, or might request him to stay as a sharer in the <lb/>
            popular cause." The people, induced by these fair speeches, <lb/>
            conferred on him the supreme authority, and, while they <lb/>
            were incensed at the power of the senate, surrendered them <note type="footnote"> * King of Pontus, father of the Great Mithridates. </note> <note type="footnote"> L 2 </note> <pb n="148"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.XVI. CH.V. </note> <lb/>
            selves, with their wives and children, as slaves to the power of <lb/>
            a single tyrant. Clearchus then apprehended sixty senators <lb/>
            (the rest had taken flight), and threw them into prison. <lb/>
            The people rejoiced that the senate was overthrown, and <lb/>
            especially that it had fallen by means of a leader among the <lb/>
            senators, and that, by a reverse of fortune, their support was <lb/>
            turned to their destruction. Clearchus, by threatening all his <lb/>
            prisoners with death, made the price offered for their ransom <lb/>
            the higher; and, after receiving from them large sums of <lb/>
            money, as if he would secretly withdraw them from the <lb/>
            violence threatened by the people, despoiled those of their <lb/>
            lives whom he had previously despoiled of their fortunes.</p>
          <p>V. Learning, soon after, that war was prepared against <lb/>
            him by those who had made their escape (several cities being <lb/>
            moved by pity to espouse their cause), he gave freedom to their <lb/>
            slaves; and that no affliction might be wanting to distress the <lb/>
            most honourable families, he obliged their wives and daughters <lb/>
            to marry their slaves, threatening death to such as refused, <lb/>
            that he might thus render the slaves more attached to himself, <lb/>
            and less reconcileable to their masters. But such marriages <lb/>
            were more intolerable to the women than immediate death; <lb/>
            and many, in consequence, killed themselves before the nuptial <lb/>
            rites were celebrated, and many in the midst of them, first <lb/>
            killing their new husbands, and delivering themselves from <lb/>
            dishonourable sufferings by a spirit of noble virtue. A battle <lb/>
            was then fought, in which the tyrant, being victorious, dragged <lb/>
            such of the senators as he took prisoners before the faces of <lb/>
            their countrymen in triumph. Returning into the city, he <lb/>
            threw some into prison, stretched others on the rack, and put <lb/>
            others to death; and not a place in the city was unvisited <lb/>
            by the tyrants cruelty. Arrogance was added to severity, <lb/>
            insolence to inhumanity. From a course of continued good <lb/>
            fortune, he sometimes forgot that he was a man, sometimes <lb/>
            called himself the son of Jupiter. When he appeared in <lb/>
            public, a golden eagle, as a token of his parentage, was carried <lb/>
            before him; he wore a purple robe, buskins like kings in <lb/>
            tragedies, and a crown of gold. His son he named Ceraunos,* to <lb/>
            mock the gods, not only with false statements, but with impious <lb/>
            names. Two noble youths, Chion and Leonides, incensed <lb/>
            that he should dare to commit such outrages, and desiring to <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κεραυνός</foreign>, thunder. </note> <lb/>

            They were disciples of Plato the philosopher, and being <lb/>
            desirous to exhibit to their country the virtue in which they <lb/>
            were daily instructed by the precepts of their master, placed <lb/>
            fifty of their relations, as if they were their attendants, in am. <lb/>
            bush ; while they themselves, in the character of men who had <lb/>
            a dispute to be settled, went into the citadel to the tyrant.. <lb/>
            Gaining admission, as being well known, the tyrant, while he <lb/>
            was listening attentively to the one that spoke first, was killed <lb/>
            by the other. But as their accomplices were too late in <lb/>
            coming to their support, they were overpowered by the guards; <lb/>
            and hence it happened that though the tyrant was killed, their <lb/>
            country was not liberated. Satyrus, the brother of Clearchus, <lb/>
            made himself tyrant in a similar way; and for many years, <lb/>
            with various successive changes, the Heracleans continued <lb/>
            under the yoke of tyrants.</p>

            as a man, he took him off by poison, using as his agent in this <lb/>

            ment of his calamities, the prelude to approaching ruin; <lb/>
            for executions of several great men were added to the murder <lb/>
            of his son, who were put to death for expressing concern at <lb/>
            the young prince's fate; and, in consequence, both those <lb/>
            about the court who escaped this cruelty, and those who were <lb/>
            in command of the troops, began at once to desert to Seleucus, <lb/>
            and incite him to make war upon Lysimachus; an enterprise <lb/>
            to which he was already inclined from a desire to emulate his <lb/>
            glory. This was the last contest between the fellow soldiers <lb/>
            of Alexander; and the two combatants were reserved, as it <lb/>
            were, for an example of the influence of fortune. Lysimachus <lb/>
            was seventy-four years old; Seleucus seventy-se ven. But at <lb/>
            this age they both had the fire of youth, and an insatiable <lb/>
            desire of power; for though they alone possessed the whole <lb/>
            world,* they yet thought themselves confined within narrow <lb/>
            limits, and measured their course of life, not by their length of <lb/>
            years, but by the extent to which they carried their dominion.</p>
          <p>II. In this war, Lysimachus (who had previously lost, by <lb/>
            various chances of fortune, fifteen children) died, with no <lb/>
            small bravery, and crowned the ruin of his family. Seleucus, <lb/>
            overjoyed at such a triumph, and what he thought greater <lb/>
            than the triumph, that he alone survived of all Alexander's <lb/>
            staff,† the conqueror of conquerors, boasted that " this was <lb/>
            not the work of man, but a favour from the gods," little think­ <lb/>
            ing that he himself was shortly after to be an instance of <lb/>
            human instability; for in the course of about seven months, <lb/>
            he was treacherously surprised by Ptolemy,‡ whose sister <lb/>
            Lysimachus had married, and put to death, losing the king <lb/>

            mother Arsinoë, his sister,. promising to adopt the young men, <lb/>
            so that, when he should succeed to the throne of their father, <lb/>
            they might not venture, through respect for their mother, or <lb/>
            the influence of the name of father, to attempt anything <lb/>
            against him. He solicited, too, by letter, the friendship of <lb/>
            his brother the king of Egypt, professing that " he laid aside <lb/>
            all feelings of resentment at being deprived of his fathers <lb/>
            kingdom, and that he would no longer ask that from a brother <lb/>
            which he had more honourably obtained from his father's <lb/>
            enemy."† He also in every way flattered Nicomedes,‡ that <lb/>
            as he was about to have a war with Antigonus, the son of De­ <lb/>
            metrius, and Antiochus the son of Seleucus, he might not <lb/>
            come upon him as a third enemy. Nor was Pyrrhus of Epirus, <lb/>
            neglected by him, a king who would be of great assistance to <lb/>
            whichsoever side he attached himself, and who, while he <lb/>
            desired to spoil them one by one, sought the favour of all. <lb/>
            On going to assist the Tarentines, therefore, against the <lb/>
            Romans, he desired of Antigonus the loan of vessels to trans­ <lb/>
            port his army into Italy; of Antiochus, who was better provided <lb/>
            with wealth than with men, a sum of money ; and of Ptolemy, <lb/>
            some troops of Macedonian soldiers. Ptolemy, who had no <lb/>
            excuse for holding back for want of forces, supplied him with <lb/>
            five thousand infantry, four thousand cavalry, and fifty ele­ <lb/>
            phants, but for not more than two years' service. In return <lb/>
            for this favour, Pyrrhus, after marrying the daughter of <lb/>
            Ptolemy, appointed him guardian of his kingdom in his <lb/>
            absence; lest, on carrying the flower of his army into Italy, <lb/>
            he should leave his dominions a prey to his enemies.</p>

            particulars should be premised concerning the rise of that <lb/>
            kingdom. The first regal power in this country was that of <lb/>
            the Molossi. Afterwards Pyrrhus, the son of Achilles, having <lb/>
            been deprived of his father's dominions - during his absence in <lb/>
            the Trojan war, settled in these parts; the inhabitants of <lb/>
            which were first called Pyrrhidæ, and afterwards Epirots. <lb/>
            This Pyrrhus, going to the temple of Jupiter at Dodona to <lb/>
            consult the oracle, seized there by force Lanassa, the grand­ <lb/>
            daughter of Hercules, and by a marriage with her had eight <lb/>
            children. Of his daughters he gave some in marriage to the <lb/>
            neighbouring princes, and by means of these alliances <lb/>
            acquired great power. He gave to Helenus,t the son of King <lb/>
            Priam, for his eminent services, the kingdom of the Chaonians, <lb/>
            and Andromache the widow of Hector in marriage, after she <lb/>
            had been his own wife, he having received her at the division <lb/>
            of the Trojan spoil. Shortly after he was slain at Delphi, at <lb/>
            the very altar of Apollo, by the treachery of Orestes the son of <lb/>
            Agamemnon. His successor was his son Pielus. The throne <lb/>
            afterwards passed in regular descent to Arrybas, over whom, as <lb/>
            he was an orphan, and the only survivor of a noble family, <lb/>
            guardians were publicly appointed, the concern of all being so <lb/>
            much the greater to preserve and educate him. He was also <lb/>
            sent to Athens for the sake of instruction; and, as he was more <lb/>
            learned than his predecessors, so he became more popular with <lb/>
            his subjects. He was the first, accordingly, that established <lb/>
            laws, a senate, annual magistrates, and a regular form of <lb/>
            government; and as a settlement was found for the people by <lb/>
            Pyrrhus, so a more civilized way of life was introduced by <lb/>
            Arrybas. A son of this king was Neoptolemus, the father of <lb/>
            Olympias (mother of Alexander the great), and of Alexander, <lb/>
            who occupied the throne of Epirus after him, and died in <lb/>
            Italy in a war with the Bruttii. On the death of Alexander <lb/>
            his brother Æacides became king, who, by wearying his <lb/>

            carried off into lllyricum, and delivered to Beroë, who was the <lb/>
            wife of king Glaucias, and of the family of the AEacidae, to be <lb/>
            brought up. This king, moved either by pity for the boys <lb/>
            misfortunes, or by his infantine caresses, protected him for a <lb/>
            long time against Cassander, king of Macedonia, (who <lb/>
            demanded him with menaces of war,) having the kindness also <lb/>
            to adopt him for his better security. The Epirots, being <lb/>
            moved by these acts, and turning their hatred into pity, <lb/>
            brought him back, when he was eleven years old, into the <lb/>
            kingdom, appointing him guardians to keep the throne for him <lb/>
            till he became of age. When he grew up he engaged in <lb/>
            many wars, and, by a train of success, attained such eminence <lb/>
            as a leader, that he was the only man who was thought capable <lb/>

          <p>I. PYRRHUS, king of Epirus, therefore, being solicited by a <lb/>
            second embassy from the Tarentines, to which were added the <lb/>
            entreaties of the Samnites and Lucanians, who likewise needed <lb/>
            assistance against the Romans, was induced to comply, not so <lb/>
            much by the prayers of the suitors, as by the hope of making <lb/>
            himself master of Italy, and promised to come to them with <lb/>
            an army. When his thoughts, indeed, were once directed to <lb/>
            that enterprise, the examples of his predecessors began to <lb/>
            impel him violently towards it, in order that he might not <lb/>
            appear inferior to his uncle Alexander, whom the Taren­ <lb/>
            tines had had for a defender against the Bruttii, or to have less <lb/>
            spirit than Alexander the Great, who had subdued the east in <pb n="154"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.XVIII. CH.II. </note> <lb/>
            so distant an expedition from his native country. Having left <lb/>
            his son Ptolemy, therefore, who was but fifteen years old, as <lb/>
            guardian of his kingdom, he landed his army in the harbour <lb/>
            of Tarentum, taking with him his two younger sons, Alexander <lb/>
            and Helenus, as a comfort to him in so long a voyage. The <lb/>
            Roman consul, Valerius Lævinus, hearing of his arrival, and <lb/>
            hastening to come to battle with him before the forces of his <lb/>
            allies were assembled, led forth his army into the field. Nor <lb/>
            did the king, although he was inferior in number of forces, <lb/>
            hesitate to engage. But as the Romans were getting the <lb/>
            advantage, the appearance of the elephants, previously unknown <lb/>
            to them, made them at first stand amazed, and afterwards <lb/>
            quit the field; and the strange monsters of the Macedonians­ <lb/>
            at once conquered the conquerors. The triumph of the enemy, <lb/>
            however, was not bloodless ; for Pyrrhus himself was severely <lb/>
            wounded, and a great number of his soldiers killed; and he <lb/>
            had more glory from his victory than pleasure. Many cities <lb/>
            of Italy, moved by the result of this battle, surrendered to <lb/>
            Pyrrhus; among others also Locri, betraying the Roman <lb/>
            garrison, revolted to him. Of the prisoners, Pyrrhus sent <lb/>
            back two hundred to Rome without ransom, that the Romans, <lb/>
            after experiencing his valour, might experience also his <lb/>
            generosity. Some days after, when the forces of his allies <lb/>
            had come up, he fought a second battle with the Romans, of <lb/>
            which the event was similar to that of the former.</p>
          <p>II. In the meantime, Mago, general of the Carthaginians, <lb/>
            being sent to the aid of the Romans with a hundred and <lb/>
            twenty ships, went to the senate, saying that " the Cartha­ <lb/>
            ginians were much concerned that they should be distressed <lb/>
            by war in Italy from a foreign prince; and that for this reason <lb/>
            he had been despatched to assist them; that, as they were <lb/>
            attacked by a foreign enemy, they might be supported by <lb/>
            foreign aid." The thanks of the senate were given to the <lb/>
            Carthaginians, and the succours sent back. But Mago, with <lb/>
            the cunning of a Carthaginian, went privately, a few days <lb/>
            after, to Pyrrhus, as if to be a peace-maker from the people <lb/>
            of Carthage, but in reality to discover the king's views with <lb/>
            regard to Sicily, to which island it was reported that he was <note type="footnote"> * As having been sent to Pyrrhus by Ptolemy Ceraunus, king of <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> B.C. 274.] </note> <lb/>
            sent for: since the Cartbaginians had the same reason * for <lb/>
            sending assistance to the Romans, namely that Pyrrhus might <lb/>
            be detained by a war with that people in Italy, and prevented <lb/>
            from crossing over into Sicily. During the course of these <lb/>
            transactions, Fabricius Luscinus, being commissioned by the <lb/>
            senate of Rome, had made peace with Pyrrhus. To ratify the <lb/>
            treaty, Cineas was sent to Rome by Pyrrhus with valuable <lb/>
            presents, but found nobody's house open for their reception <lb/>
            To this instance of Roman incorruptibility, another, very <lb/>
            similar, happened about the same time. Certain ambassadors, <lb/>
            who were sent by the senate into Egypt, having refused some <lb/>
            costly presents offered them by Ptolemy, and being invited <lb/>
            to supper some days after, golden crowns were sent to them, <lb/>
            which, from respect to the king, they accepted, but placed <lb/>
            them the next day on the king's statues. Cineas, bringing <lb/>
            word that " the treaty with the Romans was broken off by <lb/>
            Appius Claudius," and being asked by Pyrrhus " what sort <lb/>
            of city Rome was," replied that "it appeared to him a city <lb/>
            of kings." Soon after, ambassadors from the Sicilians arrived, <lb/>
            to offer Pyrrhus the dominion of the whole island, which was <lb/>
            harassed by constant wars with the Carthaginians. Leaving <lb/>
            his son Alexander, therefore, at Locri, and securing the cities <lb/>
            of his allies with strong garrisons, Pyrrhus transported his <lb/>
            army into Sicily.</p>
          <p>III. Since I come to speak of the Carthaginians, a short <lb/>
            account shall be given of their origin, tracing back, to some <lb/>
            extent, the history of the Tyrians, whose misfortunes were <lb/>
            much to be pitied. The nation of the Tyrians was founded <lb/>
            by the Phœnicians, who, suffering from an earthquake, and <lb/>
            abandoning their country, settled at first near the Syrian lake,† <lb/>
            and afterwards on the coast near the sea, where they built a <lb/>
            city, which, from the abundance of fish, they named Sidon, <lb/>
            for so the Phœnicians call a fish in their language. Many <lb/>
            years after, their city being stormed by the king of the <note type="footnote"> * Nam Romanis eadem causa mittendi auxilii Carthaginiensibus fuit, <unclear/><lb/>

            Ascalonians,* sailing away to the place where Tyre stands <lb/>
            they built that city the year before the fall of Troy, <lb/>
            Here, harassed for a long time, and in various ways, by <lb/>
            attacks from the Persians, they resisted, indeed, successfully, <lb/>
            but, as their strength was exhausted, they suffered the most <lb/>
            cruel treatment from their slaves, who were then extraordi­ <lb/>
            narily numerous. These traitors, having entered into a <lb/>
            conspiracy, killed their masters and all the free people of the <lb/>
            city, and thus, becoming masters of the place, took possession <lb/>
            of the houses of their owners, assumed the government, <lb/>
            appropriated wives to themselves, and begot, what they them­ <lb/>
            selves were not, freemen. Out of so many thousands of <lb/>
            slaves, there was one who was moved to compassion by the <lb/>
            mild disposition of his aged master and the hard fortune of <lb/>
            his little son, and looked upon them, not with savage fierce­ <lb/>
            ness, but with humanity, affection, and pity. He put them <lb/>
            out of the way, therefore, as if they had been killed; and <lb/>
            when the slaves came to deliberate about the condition of <lb/>
            their government, and had resolved that a king should be <lb/>
            elected from their own body, and that he should be preferred, <lb/>
            as most acceptable to the gods, who should first see the rising <lb/>
            Bull, he mentioned the matter to Strato (for that was the <lb/>
            name of his master), who was then in concealment. Being <lb/>
            instructed by him, and proceeding with the rest, about the <lb/>
            middle of the night, to a certain plain, he alone, when they <lb/>
            were all looking towards the east, kept his eye directed <lb/>
            towards the west. This at first seemed madness to the others, <lb/>
            to look in the west for the rising sun; but when day began <lb/>
            to advance, and the rising luminary to shine on the highest <lb/>
            eminences of the city, he, while all the rest were watching to <lb/>
            see the sun itself, was the first to point out to them the sun­ <lb/>
            shine on the loftiest pinnacle of the town. This thought <lb/>
            seemed above the wit of a slave ; and when they asked him who <lb/>
            had put it into his head, he confessed that it was his master. <lb/>
            It was then seen how far the abilities of freemen surpass <lb/>
            those of slaves, who, though they may be first in viciousness, <lb/>
            are not first in wisdom. The old man and his son were <lb/>
            therefore spared ; and the slaves, thinking that they had been <lb/>
            preserved by the interposition of some deity, made Strato <lb/>
            king. After his death, the throne descended to his son, and <note type="footnote">* Ascaloniorum.] Inhabitants of Ascalon, between Azotus and Gaza. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="157"/>
            subsequently to his grandsons. This atrocity of these slaves <lb/>
            was much noticed, and was a terrible example to the wholo <lb/>
            world. Alexander the Great, when he was prosecuting his <lb/>
            wars, some time after, in the east, having taking the city, <lb/>
            crucified, as an avenger of the general safety, and in memory <lb/>
            of the former massacre, all those who survived the siege; <lb/>
            preserving from injury only the family of Strato, and restoring <lb/>
            the throne - to his descendants ; and sending to the island, at <lb/>
            the same time, inhabitants that were free-born and guiltless, <lb/>
            that, as the race of slaves was extirpated, an entirely new <lb/>
            generation might be established in the city.</p>
          <p>1V. The Tyrians, being thus settled under the auspices of <lb/>
            Alexander, quickly grew powerful by frugality and industry.</p>
          <p>Before the massacre of the masters by the slaves, when they <lb/>
            abounded in wealth and population, they sent a portion of their <lb/>
            youth into Africa, and founded Utica. Meanwhile their king <lb/>
            died at Tyre, appointing his son Pygmalion and his daughter <lb/>
            Elissa, a maiden of extraordinary beauty, his heirs. But <lb/>
            the people gave the throne to Pygmalion, who was quite a boy. <lb/>
            Elissa married Acerbas,t her uncle, who was priest of <lb/>
            Hercules, a dignity next to that of the king. Acerbas had <lb/>
            great but concealed riches, having laid up his gold, for fear <lb/>
            of the king, not in his house, but in the earth; a fact of which, <lb/>
            though people had no certain knowledge of it, report was not <lb/>
            silent. Pygmalion, excited by the account, and forgetful of <lb/>
            the laws of humanity, murdered his uncle, who was also <lb/>
            his brother-in-law, without the least regard to natural <lb/>
            affection. Elissa long entertained a hatred to her brother for <lb/>
            his crime, but at last, dissembling her detestation, and <lb/>
            assuming mild looks for the time, she secretly contrived a <lb/>
            mode of flight, admitting into her confidence some of the <lb/>
            leading men of the city, in whom she saw that there was a <lb/>
            similar hatred of the king, and an equal desire to escape. <lb/>
            She then addressed her brother in such a way as to deceive <lb/>
            him; pretending that "she had a desire to remove to his <lb/>
            house, in order that the home of her husband might no <lb/>
            longer revive in her, when she was desirous to forget him, the <lb/>
            oppressive recollection of her sorrows, and that the sad <note type="footnote"> * It does not appear how they were deprived of it. </note><note type="footnote"> † Called by Virgil Sichœus. Servius thinks that the real name was <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B.XVIII. CH.V </note> <lb/>
            remembrances of him might no more present themselves to <lb/>
            her eyes." To these words of his sister, Pygmalion was no <lb/>
            unwilling listener, thinking that with her the gold of Acerbas <lb/>
            would come to him. But Elissa put the attendants, who were <lb/>
            sent by the king to assist in her removal, on board some vessels <lb/>
            in the early part of the evening, and sailing out into the deep, <lb/>
            made them throw some loads of sand, put up in sacks, as if it <lb/>
            was money, into the sea. Then, with tears and mournful <lb/>
            ejaculations, she invoked Acerbas, entreating that " he would <lb/>
            favourably receive his wealth which he had left behind him, <lb/>
            and accept that as an offering to his shade, which he had found <lb/>
            to be the cause of his death." Next she addressed the attend­ <lb/>
            ants, and said that " death had long been desired by her, but <lb/>
            as for them, cruel torments and a direful end awaited them, <lb/>
            for having disappointed the tyrant's avarice of those treasures, <lb/>
            in the hopes of obtaining which he had committed fratricide." <lb/>
            Having thus struck terror into them all, she took them with <lb/>
            her as companions of her flight. Some bodies of senators, too, <lb/>
            who were ready against that night, came to join her, and <lb/>
            having offered a sacrifice to Hercules, whose priest Acerbas <lb/>
            had been, proceeded to seek a settlement in exile</p>
          <p>V. Their first landing place was the isle of Cyprus, where <lb/>
            the priest of Jupiter, with his wife and children, offered him <lb/>
            self to Elissa, at the instigation of the gods, as her com­ <lb/>
            panion and the sharer of her fortunes, stipulating for the per­ <lb/>
            petual honour of the priesthood for himself and his descend­ <lb/>
            ants. The stipulation was received as a manifest omen of <lb/>
            good fortune. It was a custom among the Cyprians to send <lb/>
            their daughters, on stated days before their marriage, to the <lb/>
            sea-shore, to prostitute themselves, and thus procure money for <lb/>
            their marriage portions, and to pay, at the same time, offerings <lb/>
            to Venus for the preservation of their chastity in time to come. <lb/>
            Of these Elissa ordered about eighty to be seized and taken <lb/>
            on board, that her men might have wives, and her city a <lb/>
            population. During the course of these transactions, Pygma­ <lb/>
            lion, having heard of his sister's flight, and preparing to <lb/>
            pursue her with unfeeling hostility, was scarcely induced by <lb/>
            the prayers of his mother and the menaces of the gods to <lb/>
            remain quiet; the inspired augurs warning him that " he <lb/>
            would not escape with impunity, if he interrupted the founding <lb/>
            of a city that was to become the most prosperous in the <pb n="159"/>
            <note type="margin"> B.C. 825.] </note> <lb/>
            world." By this means some respite was given to the fugitives; <lb/>
            and Elissa, arriving in a gulf of Africa, attached the inhabit­ <lb/>
            ants of the coast, who rejoiced at the arrival of foreigners, and <lb/>
            the opportunity of bartering commodities with them, to her <lb/>
            interest. Having then bargained for a piece of ground, as <lb/>
            much as could be covered * with an ox-hide, where she might <lb/>
            refresh her companions, wearied with their long voyage, until <lb/>
            she could conveniently resume her progress, she directed the <lb/>
            hide to be cut into the thinnest possible strips, and thus <lb/>
            acquired a greater portion of ground than she had apparently <lb/>
            demanded ; whence the place had afterwards the name of <lb/>
            Byrsa. The people of the neighbourhood subsequently <lb/>
            gathering about her, bringing, in hopes of gain, many articles <lb/>
            to the strangers for sale, and gradually fixing their abodes <lb/>
            there, some resemblance of a city arose from the concourse. <lb/>
            Ambassadors from the people of Utica, too, brought them <lb/>
            presents as relatives, and exhorted them " to build a city where <lb/>
            they had chanced to obtain a settlement." An inclination to <lb/>
            detain the strangers was felt also by the Africans; and, <lb/>
            accordingly, with the consent of all, Carthage was founded, <lb/>
            an annual tribute being fixed for the ground which it was to <lb/>
            occupy. At the commencement of digging the foundations an <lb/>
            ox's head was found, which was an omen that the city would <lb/>
            be wealthy, indeed, but laborious and always enslaved. It was <lb/>
            therefore removed to another place, where the head of a horse <lb/>
            was found, which, indicating that the people would be warlike <lb/>
            and powerful, portended an auspicious site. In a short time, <lb/>
            as the surrounding people came together at the report, the <lb/>
            inhabitants became numerous, and the city itself extensive.</p>
          <p>VI. When the power of the Carthaginians, from success in <lb/>
            their proceedings, had risen to some height, Hiarbas, king of <lb/>
            the Maxitani,† desiring an interview with ten of the chief men <lb/>
            of Carthage, demanded Elissa in marriage, denouncing war in <lb/>
            case of a refusal. The deputies, fearing to report this message <lb/>
            to the queen, acted towards her with Carthaginian artifice, <note type="footnote"> * Tegi posset.] Justin misapplies this word. A better account is <lb/>

            saying that "the king asked for some person to teach him and <lb/>
            his Africans a more civilized way of life, but who could be <lb/>
            found that would leave his relations and go to barbarians, and <lb/>
            people that were living like wild beasts?" Being then <lb/>
            reproached by the queen, "in case they refused a hard life for <lb/>
            the benefit of their country, to which, should circumstances <lb/>
            require, their life itself was due," they disclosed the king's <lb/>
            message, saying that "she herself, if she wished her city to be <lb/>
            secure, must do what she required of others." Being caught <lb/>
            by this subtlety, she at last said (after calling for a long time <lb/>
            with many tears and mournful lamentations on the name of <lb/>
            her husband Acerbas), that "she would go whither the fate of <lb/>
            her city called her." Taking three months for the accomplish <lb/>
            ment of her resolution, and having raised a funeral pile at the <lb/>
            extremity of the city, she sacrificed many victims, as if she <lb/>
            would appease the shade of her husband, and make her <lb/>
            offerings to him before her marriage; and then, taking a sword, <lb/>
            she ascended the pile, and, looking towards the people, said, <lb/>
            that "she would go to her husband as they had desired <lb/>
            her," and put an end to her life with the sword. As long <lb/>
            as Carthage remained unconquered, she was worshipped as <lb/>
            a goddess. This city was founded seventy-two years. before <lb/>
            Rome; but while the bravery of its inhabitants made it famous <lb/>
            in war, it was internally disturbed with various troubles, <lb/>
            arising from civil differences. Being afflicted, among other <lb/>
            calamities, with a pestilence, they adopted a cruel religious <lb/>
            ceremony, an execrable abomination, as a remedy for it; for <lb/>
            they immolated human beings as victims, and brought children <lb/>
            (whose age excites pity even in enemies) to the altars, <lb/>
            entreating favour of the gods by shedding the blood of those for <lb/>
            whose life the gods are generally wont to be entreated.</p>
          <p>VII. In consequence of the gods, therefore, being rendered <note type="footnote"> * There is a strange variety of opinions among authors as to the <lb/>
            time when this city was founded. Some make it thirty years prior to <lb/>

            whom deny that Dido was the founder of it; some say that it was <lb/>
            founded after Troy was taken, but before the building of Rome; but <lb/>

            adverse by such atrocities, after they had long fought unsuc­ <lb/>
            cessfully in Sicily, and had transferred the war into Sardinia, <lb/>
            they were defeated in a great battle with the loss of the greater <lb/>
            part of their army; a disaster for which they sentenced their <lb/>
            general Malchus,* under whose conduct they had both con­ <lb/>
            quered a part of Sicily and achieved great exploits against the <lb/>
            Africans, to remain in exile with the portion of his army that <lb/>
            survived. The soldiers, indignant at this sentence, sent depu­ <lb/>
            ties to Carthage, to beg, in the first place, permission for them <lb/>
            to return, and pardon for their ill success in the field ; and, in <lb/>
            the second place, to announce that " what they could not ob­ <lb/>
            tain by entreaty, they would obtain by force of arms." The <lb/>
            prayers and threats of the deputies being alike slighted, the <lb/>
            troops, after some days, went on board ship, and came under <lb/>
            arms to the city, when they called gods and men to witness <lb/>
            that " they were not come to overthrow, but to recover their <lb/>
            country; and that they would show their countrymen that it <lb/>
            was not valour, but fortune, that had failed them in the pre­ <lb/>
            ceding war." By stopping the supplies, and besieging the city, <lb/>
            they reduced the Carthaginians to the greatest despair. At <lb/>
            this time Cartalo, the son of Malchus the exiled general, <lb/>
            returning by his father's camp from Tyre (whither he had <lb/>
            been sent by the Carthaginians, to carry the tenth of the <lb/>
            plunder of Sicily, which his father had taken, to Hercules), <lb/>
            and being desired by his father to wait on him, replied that <lb/>
            " he would discharge his religious duties to the public,† before <lb/>
            those of merely private obligation." His father, though he <lb/>
            was indignant at his conduct, was nevertheless afraid to <lb/>
            obstruct him in the performance of his religious offices. Some <lb/>
            days after, Cartalo, having obtained leave of absence from the <lb/>
            people, and returning to his father, presented himself before <lb/>
            all the people, dressed in the purple and fillets of his sacer­ <lb/>
            dotal dignity, when his father took him aside, and said, <lb/>
            " Hast thou dared, most unnatural wretch, to appear before <lb/>
            so many of thy miserable countrymen, thus arrayed in purple <lb/>
            and gold, and to enter, with all the marks of peaceful pros­ <lb/>

            this sad and mournful camp ? Couldst thou display thyself <lb/>
            nowhere else to thy fellow creatures? Was no place fitter <lb/>
            for it than where the misery of thy father, and the distress of <lb/>
            his unhappy banishment, were to be seen ? I have to add, <lb/>
            too, that when thou wast summoned a short time ago, thou <lb/>
            proudly despisedst, I do not say thy father, but certainly the <lb/>
            general of thy countrymen. And what else dost thou exhibit <lb/>
            in that purple and those crowns, but the titles of my victo­ <lb/>
            ries ? Since thou, therefore, acknowledgest nothing in thy <lb/>
            father but the name of an exile, I also will assume the charac­ <lb/>
            ter, not of a father, but of a general, and will make such an <lb/>
            example of thee, that no one may hereafter dare to sport with <lb/>
            the miseries and sorrows of a parent." He accordingly ordered <lb/>
            him to be nailed, in all his finery, on a high cross within view <lb/>
            of the city. A few days after he took Carthage, and assem­ <lb/>
            bling the people, complained of the injustice of his banish­ <lb/>
            ment, pleaded necessity as his excuse for making war upon <lb/>
            them, and added that " being content with his victory, and <lb/>
            the punishment of the authors of their country's misery,. he <lb/>
            granted a free pardon for his unjust banishment to all the <lb/>
            rest." Having accordingly put ten senators to death, he left <lb/>
            the city to the government of its laws. But being accused <lb/>
            himself, shortly after, of aspiring to be king, he paid the <lb/>
            penalty of his twofold cruelty to his son and his country. He <lb/>
            was succeeded, as commander-in-chief, by Mago, by whose <lb/>
            exertions the power of Carthage, the extent of its territories, <lb/>
            and its military glory, was much increased. <note type="footnote"> * Auctoribus miserorum civium is the reading of all the texts, but <lb/>

            been the first, by regulating their military discipline, to lae <lb/>
            the foundations of the Punic power, and after establishing thy <lb/>
            strength of the state, not less by bis skill in the art of war <lb/>
            than by his personal prowess, died, leaving behind him two <lb/>
            sons, Hasdrubal and Hamilcar, who, pursuing the honourable <lb/>
            course of their father, were heirs to his greatness as well as to <lb/>
            his name. Under their generalship war was made upon <lb/>
            Sardinia; and a contest was also maintained against the <lb/>
            Africans, who demanded tribute for many years for the ground <lb/>
            on which the city stood. But as the cause of the Africans <lb/>
            was the more just, their fortune was likewise superior, and the <lb/>
            struggle with them was ended-not by exertions in the field-by <lb/>
            the payment of a sum of money. In Sardinia Hasdrubal was <lb/>
            severely wounded, and died there, leaving the command to his <lb/>
            brother Hamilcar; and not only the mourning throughout his <lb/>
            country, but the fact that he had held eleven dictatorships and <lb/>
            enjoyed four triumphs,* rendered his death an object of <lb/>
            general notice. The courage of the enemy, too, was raised by <lb/>
            it, as if the power of the Carthaginians had expired with their <lb/>
            general. The people of Sicily, therefore, applying, in conse­ <lb/>
            quence of the perpetual depredations of the Carthaginians, to <lb/>
            Leonidas, the brother of the king of Sparta, for aid, a <lb/>
            grievous war broke out, which continued, with various success, <lb/>
            for a long period.</p>
          <p>During the course of these transactions, ambassadors came <lb/>
            to Carthage from Darius king of Persia, bringing an edict, by <lb/>
            which the Carthaginians were forbidden to offer human sacri­ <lb/>

            requesting, at the same time, assistance against Greece, on <lb/>
            which Darius was about to make war.t The Carthaginians <lb/>
            declined giving him aid, on account of their continual wars <lb/>
            with their neighbours, but, that they might not appear uncom. <lb/>
            pliant in every thing, willingly submitted to the decree.</p>
          <p>II. Hamilcar, meanwhile, was killed in battle in Sicily, <lb/>
            leaving three sons, Himilco, Hanno, and Gisco. Hasdrubal <lb/>
            also had the same number of sons, Hannibal, Hasdrubal, and <lb/>
            Sappho. ‡ By these the affairs of the Carthaginians were <lb/>
            managed at this period. War was made upon the Moors, a <lb/>
            contest was maintained with the Numidians, and the Africans <lb/>
            were compelled to remit the tribute paid for the building of <lb/>
            the city. At length, however, as so numerous a family of <lb/>
            commanders was dangerous to the liberty of the state, since <lb/>
            they themselves managed and decided every thing, a hundred <lb/>
            judges were chosen out of the senate, who were to demand of <lb/>
            the generals, when they returned from war, an account of <lb/>
            their proceedings, in order that, under this control, they <lb/>

            He, lifting up his hands to heaven, sometimes bewailed his <lb/>
            own lot, sometimes the misfortune of the state, and sometimes <lb/>
            complained of " the gods, who had deprived him of such <lb/>

            himself, he took nothing more to heart than that he could not <lb/>
            die among the brave, and was reserved, not to enjoy life, but <lb/>
            to be the sport of calamity. However, as he had brought the <lb/>
            wretched remains of his army to Carthage, he would follow his <lb/>
            fellow soldiers, and prove to his country that he had not <lb/>

            through the city, and had arrived at the entrance to his own <lb/>
            house, he dismissed the crowd that followed him, as if it were <lb/>

            his door and admitting no one, not even his sons, to his <lb/>

          <p>I. DIONYSIUS, after expelling the Carthaginians from Sicily, <lb/>
            and making himself master of the whole island, thinking that <lb/>
            peace might be dangerous to his power, and idleness in so <lb/>
            great an army fatal to it, transported his forces into Italy; <lb/>
            with a wish, at the same time, that the strength of his soldiers <lb/>
            might be invigorated by constant employment, and his <lb/>
            dominions enlarged. His first contest was with the Greeks, <lb/>
            who occupied the nearest parts of the coast on the Italian sea; <lb/>
            and, having conquered them, he attacked their neighbours, <lb/>
            looking upon all of Grecian origin who were inhabitants of <lb/>
            Italy, as his enemies; and these settlers had then spread, not <unclear/> <lb/>
            merely through a part of Italy, but through almost the whole of <lb/>
            it. Many Italian cities, indeed, after so long a lapse of time, <lb/>
            still exhibit some traces of Greek manners; for the Etrurians, <lb/>
            who occupy the shore of the Tuscan sea, came from Lydia<unclear/>; <lb/>
            and Troy, after it was taken and overthrown, sent thither the <lb/>
            Veneti (whom we see on the coast of the Adriatic), under the <lb/>
             <pb n="167"/>
            leadership of Antenor. Adria, too, which is near the <lb/>
            Illyrian sea, and which gave name also to the Adriatic, is a <lb/>
            Greek city; and Diomede, being driven by shipwreck, after <lb/>
            the destruction of Troy, into those parts, built Arpi. Pisæ, <lb/>
            likewise, in Liguria, had Grecian founders ; and Tarquinii, in <lb/>
            Etruria, as well as Spina in Umbria, has its origin from the <lb/>
            Thessalians; Perusia was founded by the Achæans. Need I <lb/>
            mention Cære?* Or the people of Latium, who were settled <lb/>
            by Æneas? Are not the Falisci, are not Nola and Abella, <lb/>
            colonies of the Chalcidians? What is all the country of <lb/>
            Campania? What are the Bruttiif and Sabines? What are <lb/>
            the Samnites?‡ What are the Tarentines,§ whom we under­ <lb/>
            stand to have come from Lacedæmon, and to have been called <lb/>
            Spurii? The city of Thurii they say that Philoctetes built; <lb/>
            and his monument is seen there to this day, as well as the <lb/>
            arrows of Hercules, on which the fate of Troy depended, laid <lb/>
            up in the temple of Apollo.</p>
          <p>II.. The people of Metapontum, too, show in their temple <lb/>
            of Minerva, the iron tools with which Epeus, by whom their <lb/>
            city was founded, built the Trojan horse. Hence all that part <lb/>
            of Italy was called Greater Greece || But soon after they <lb/>
            were settled, the Metapontines, joining with the Sybarites <lb/>
            and Crotonians, formed a design to drive the rest of the <lb/>
            Greeks from Italy. Capturing, in the first place, the city <lb/>
            Sins, they slew, as they were storming it, fifty young men <lb/>
            that were embracing the statue of Minerva, and the priest of <lb/>
            the goddess dressed in his robes, between the very altars, <lb/>
            Suffering, on this account, from pestilence and civil discord, <lb/>
            the Crotonians, first of all, consulted the oracle at Delphi, <lb/>
            and answer was made to them, that “there would be an end <lb/>
            of their troubles, if they appeased the offended deity of <lb/>
            Minerva, and the manes of the slain." After they had begun, <lb/>
            accordingly, to make statues of proper size for the young men, <lb/>
            and especially for Minerva, the Metapontines, learning what <lb/>
            the oracle was, and thinking it expedient to anticipate them <note type="footnote"> * It is said by Strabo to have been settled by the Pelasgi. </note><note type="footnote"> t They are said to have sprung from the Lucanians, xxiii. 1, and on <lb/>

            in pacifying the manes of the goddess, erected to the young <lb/>
            men smaller images of stone, and propitiated the goddess <lb/>
            with offerings of bread.* The plague was thus ended in both <lb/>
            places, one people showing their zeal by their magnificence, <lb/>
            and the other by their expedition. After they bad recovered <lb/>
            their health, the Crotonians were not long disposed to be <lb/>
            quiet; and being indignant that, at the siege of Siris, assist­ <lb/>
            ance had been sent against them by the Locrians, they made <lb/>
            war on that people. The Locrians, seized with alarm, had <lb/>
            recourse to the Spartans, begging their assistance with humble <lb/>
            entreaties. But the Spartans, disliking so distant an expedi­ <lb/>
            tion, told them " to ask assistance from Castor and Pollux." <lb/>
            This answer, from a city in alliance with them, the deputies <lb/>
            did not despise, but going into the nearest temple, and <lb/>
            offering sacrifice, they implored aid from those gods. The <lb/>
            signs from the victims appearing favourable, and their request, <lb/>
            as they supposed, being granted, they were no less rejoiced <lb/>
            than if they were to carry the gods with them ; and, spreading <lb/>
            couches for them in the vessel, and setting out with happy <lb/>
            omens, they brought their countrymen comfort though not <lb/>
            assistance.</p>
          <p>III. This affair becoming known, the Crotonians tnemselves <lb/>
            also sent deputies to the oracle at Delphi, asking the way to <lb/>
            victory and a prosperous termination of the war. The answer <lb/>
            given was, that “the enemies must be conquered by vows, <lb/>
            before they could be conquered by arms." They accordingly <lb/>
            vowed the tenth of the spoil to Apollo, but the Locrians, <lb/>
            getting information of this vow, and the god's answer, vowed <lb/>
            a ninth part, keeping the matter however secret, that they <lb/>
            might not be outdone in vows. When they came into the <lb/>
            field, therefore, and a hundred and twenty thousand Croto­ <lb/>
            nians stood in arms against them, the Locrians, contemplating <lb/>
            the smallness of their own force (for they had only fifteen <lb/>
            thousand men), and abandoning all hope of victory, devoted <lb/>
            themselves to certain death; and such courage, arising out of <lb/>
            despair, was felt by each, that they thought they would be as <lb/>
            conquerors, if they did not fall without avenging themselves. <lb/>
            But while they sought only to die with honour, they had the <lb/>
            good fortune to gain the victory; nor was there any other <note type="footnote"> * Panificiis.) We might, with Ostertagius, read pannificiis (cloths of <lb/>
            garments), which were more appropriate to Minerva. — Wetzel. </note> <pb n="169"/>
            <note type="margin"> <unclear>B</unclear>.C. 540.] </note> <lb/>
            cause of their success but their desperation. While the <lb/>
            Locrians were fighting, an eagle constantly attended on <lb/>
            their army, and continued flying about them till they were <lb/>
            conquerors. On the wings, also, were seen two young men <lb/>
            fighting in armour different from that of the rest, of an <lb/>
            extraordinary stature, on white horses and in scarlet cloaks; <lb/>
            nor were they visible longer than the battle lasted. The <lb/>
            incredible swiftness of the report of the battle made this <lb/>
            wonderful appearance more remarkable ; for on the same <lb/>
            day on which it was fought in Italy, the victory was published <lb/>
            at Corinth, Athens, and Lacedæmon.</p>
          <p>IV. After this event the Crotonians ceased to exercise their <lb/>
            valour, or to care for distinction in the field. They hated the <lb/>
            arms which they had unsuccessfully taken up, and would have <lb/>
            abandoned their former way of life for one of luxury, had not <lb/>
            Pythagoras arisen among them. This philosopher was born <lb/>
            at Samos, the son of Demaratus, a rich merchant, and after <lb/>
            being greatly advanced in wisdom, went first to Egypt, and <lb/>
            afterwards to Babylon, to learn the motions of the stars and <lb/>
            study the origin of the universe, and acquired very great <lb/>
            knowledge. Returning from thence, he went to Crete and <lb/>
            Lacedæmon, to instruct himself in the laws of Minos and <lb/>
            Lycurgus, which at that time were in high repute. Furnished <lb/>
            with all these attainments, he came to Crotona, and, by his <lb/>
            influence, recalled the people, when they were giving them­ <lb/>
            selves up to luxury, to the observance of frugality. He used <lb/>
            daily to recommend virtue, and to enumerate the ill effects <lb/>
            of luxury, and the misfortunes of states that had been ruined <lb/>
            by its pestilential influence; and he thus produced in the <lb/>
            people such a love of temperance, that it was at length thought <lb/>
            incredible that any of them should be extravagant. He <lb/>
            frequently gave instruction to the women apart from the <lb/>
            men, and to the children apart from their parents. He <lb/>
            impressed on the female sex the observance of chastity, and <lb/>
            submission to their husbands; on the rising generation, modesty <lb/>
            and devotion to learning. Through his whole course of <lb/>
            instruction he exhorted all to love temperance, as the mother <lb/>
            of every virtue; and he produced such an effect upon them by <lb/>
            the constancy of his lectures, that the women laid aside their <lb/>
            vestments embroidered with gold, and other ornaments and <lb/>
            distinctions, as instruments of luxury, and, bringing them <pb n="170"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.XX. CH.V. </note> <lb/>
            into the temple of Juno, consecrated them to the goddess; <lb/>
            declaring that modesty, and not fine apparel, was the true <lb/>
            adornment of their sex. How much he gained upon the <lb/>
            young men, his victory over the stubborn minds of the <lb/>
            women may serve to indicate. Three hundred of the young <lb/>
            men, however, being united by an oath of fraternity, and <lb/>
            living apart from the other citizens, drew the attention of the <lb/>
            city upon them, as if they met for some secret conspiracy; <lb/>
            and the people, when they were all collected in one building, <lb/>
            proceeded to burn them in it. In the tumult about sixty <lb/>
            lost their lives ; the rest went into exile.</p>
          <p>Pythagoras, after living twenty years at Crotona, removed <lb/>
            to Metapontum, where he died; and such was the admiration <lb/>
            of the people for his character, that they made a temple of his <lb/>
            house, and worshipped him as a god.</p>
          <p>V. Dionysius the tyrant, who, we have said, had trans­ <lb/>
            ported an army from Sicily into Italy, and made war upon the <lb/>
            Greeks there, proceeded, after taking Locri by storm, to <lb/>
            attack the Crotonians, who, in consequence of their losses in <lb/>
            the former war, were scarcely recovering their strength in a <lb/>
            long peace. With their small force, however, they resisted <lb/>
            the great army of Dionysius more valiantly than they had <lb/>
            before, with so many thousands, resisted the smaller number <lb/>
            of the Locrians. So much spirit has weakness in withstand­ <lb/>
            ing insolent power; and so much more sure, at times, is an <lb/>
            unexpected than an expected victory. But as Dionysius was <lb/>
            prosecuting the war, ambassadors from the Gauls, who had <lb/>
            burned Rome some months before,* came to him to desire an <lb/>
            alliance and friendship with him; observing that “their <lb/>
            country lay in the midst of his enemies, and could be of great <lb/>
            service to him, either by supporting him in the field, or by <lb/>
            annoying his enemies in the rear when they were engaged <lb/>
            with him." The embassy was well received by Dionysius, <lb/>
            who, having made an alliance with them, and being reinforced <lb/>
            with assistance from Gaul, renewed the war as it were afresh.</p>
          <p>The causes of the Gauls' coming into Italy, in quest of new <lb/>
            settlements, were civil discords and perpetual contentions at <lb/>
            home; and when, from impatience of those feuds, they had <note type="footnote"> * Ante menses.] As a number seems to be wanting, Scheffer would <lb/>

            gamo, Trent, and Vicenza. The Tuscans, too, when they <lb/>
            were driven from their old settlements, betook themselves, <lb/>
            under a captain named Rhætus, towards the Alps, where they <lb/>
            founded the nation of Rhætia, so named from their leader.</p>
          <p>An invasion of Sicily by the Carthaginians obliged Dio­ <lb/>
            nysius to return thither; for that people, having recruited <lb/>
            their army, had resumed the war, which they had broken off <lb/>
            in consequence of the plague, with increased spirit. The <lb/>
            leader in the expedition was Hanno the Carthaginian, whose <lb/>
            enemy Juniatus, the most powerful of the Carthaginians at <lb/>
            that time, having, from hatred to him, given friendly notice <lb/>
            to Dionysius, in a letter written in Greek, of the approach of <lb/>
            the army and the inactivity of its leader, was found, through <lb/>
            the letter being intercepted, guilty of treason ; and a decree of <lb/>
            the senate was made, " that no Carthaginian should thence­ <lb/>
            forward study the Greek literature or language, so that no one <lb/>
            might be able to speak with the enemy, or write to him, with­ <lb/>
            out an interpreter." Not long after, Dionysius, whom a little <lb/>
            before neither Sicily nor Italy could hold, being reduced and <lb/>
            weakened by continual wars, was at last killed by a conspiracy <lb/>
            among his own subjects.</p>

            elected in his room Dionysius the eldest of his sons, both in <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B.XXI. CH.II. </note> <lb/>
            Dionysius, at the commencement of his reign, was eager to <lb/>
            remove the uncles of his brothers,* as being his rivals in the <lb/>
            government, and as having encouraged the young men to ask <lb/>
            for a division of power. But concealing his inclinations for a <lb/>
            while, he applied himself first to gain the favour of his sub­ <lb/>
            jects, as being likely to cause the atrocity, which he had <lb/>
            resolved on committing, to be regarded with more indulgence, <lb/>
            if he previously made himself popular. He therefore released <lb/>
            three thousand prisoners from the gaols, remitted the people <lb/>
            the taxes for three years, and sought the affection of all by <lb/>
            whatever blandishments he could use. Then, proceeding to <lb/>
            execute his determination, he put to death, not only the rela­ <lb/>
            tives of his brothers, but his brothers themselves; so that he <lb/>
            left to those, to whom he owed a share of power, not even a <lb/>
            share of life, and commenced cruelty upon his kindred before <lb/>
            he exercised it upon strangers.</p>
          <p>II. When his rivals were removed, he fell into indolence, <lb/>
            and contracted, from excessive indulgence at table, great cor­ <lb/>
            pulence of body, and a disease in his eyes, so that he could <lb/>
            not bear the sunshine, or dust, or even the brightness of ordi­ <lb/>
            nary daylight. Suspecting that, for these weaknesses, he <lb/>
            was despised by his subjects, he proceeded to inflict cruel­ <lb/>
            ties upon them; not filling the gaols, like his father, with <lb/>
            prisoners, but the whole city with dead bodies. Hence he <lb/>
            became not more contemptible than hateful to every one. <lb/>
            The Syracusans, in consequence, resolving to rebel against <lb/>
            him, he long hesitated whether he should lay down the govern­ <lb/>
            ment or oppose them in arms; but he was compelled by the <lb/>
            soldiery, who hoped for plunder from sacking the city, to <lb/>
            march into the field. Being defeated, and trying his fortune <lb/>
            again with no better success, he sent deputies to the people of <lb/>
            Syracuse, with promises that "he would resign the govern­ <lb/>
            ment, if they would send persons to him with whom he might <lb/>
            settle terms of peace." Some of the principal citizens being <note type="footnote"> * Avunculos fratrum suorum.] Among these was Dion, who was not <lb/>
            the uncle of Dionysius himself, but of his brothers ; for Dionysius the <lb/>
            elder had Hipparinus and Nyssæus by Aristomache, the sister of Dion, <lb/>
            and Dionysius by another wife named Doris. See Corn. Nep. Vit. <lb/>
            Dion. c. i ; Died. Sic. xvi. 6 ; Plutarch. Dion. c. 3. Dion had wished <lb/>
            to ask Dionysius the elder, when he was on his death-bed, to bequeath <lb/>

            accordingly sent for that purpose, he put them in close con­ <lb/>
            finement, and then, when all were off their guard, having no <lb/>
            fear of hostilities, he despatched his army to devastate the <lb/>
            city. A contest, in consequence, which was long doubtful, <lb/>
            took place in the town itself, but the townsmen overpowering <lb/>
            the soldiery by their numbers, Dionysius was obliged to retire, <lb/>
            and fearing that he should be besieged in the citadel, fled <lb/>
            away secretly, with all his king-like paraphernalia, to Italy. <lb/>
            Being received, in his exile, by his allies the Locrians, he took <lb/>
            possession of the citadel as if he were their rightful sovereign, <lb/>
            and exercised his usual outrages upon them. He ordered the <lb/>
            wives of the principal men to be seized and violated ; he took <lb/>
            away maidens on the point of marriage, polluted them, and <lb/>
            then restored them to their betrothed husbands; and as fot <lb/>
            the wealthiest men, he either banished them or put them to <lb/>
            death, and confiscated their property</p>
          <p>III. In process of time, when a pretext for plunder was <lb/>
            wanting, he over-reached the whole city by an artful stratagem. <lb/>
            The Locrians, being harassed in war by Leophron the tyrant <lb/>
            of Rhegium, had vowed, if they were victorious, to prostitute <lb/>
            their maidens on the festal day of Venus; and as, on neglect­ <lb/>
            ing to perform the vow, they were unsuccessful in another war <lb/>
            with the Lucanians, Dionysius called them to an assembly, <lb/>
            and advised them “to send their wives and daughters, as <lb/>
            richly dressed as possible, to the temple of Venus; out of <lb/>
            whom a hundred, chosen by lot, should fulfil the public vow, <lb/>
            and, for religion's sake, offer themselves for prostitution during <lb/>
            the space of a month, the men previously taking an oath not <lb/>
            to touch any one of them; and, in order that this should <lb/>
            be no detriment to the women who released the state from <lb/>
            its vow, they should make a decree, that no other maiden <lb/>
            should be married till these were provided with husbands.” <lb/>
            This proposal, by which regard was shown both to their super­ <lb/>
            stitious observances and to the honour of their virgins, being <lb/>
            received with approbation, the whole of the women, in most <lb/>
            expensive dresses, assembled in the temple of Venus, when <lb/>
            Dionysius, sending in his soldiers, took off their finery, and <lb/>
            made the ornaments of the matrons a spoil for himself. The <lb/>
            husbands of some of them too, who were of the richer class, he <lb/>
            put to death; others he tortured to make them discover their <lb/>
            husbands' wealth. After reigning in this manner for six years, <pb n="174"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.XXI. CH.IV. </note> <lb/>
            he was driven from Locri by a conspiracy of the people, and <lb/>
            returned to Sicily ; where, while all, after so long an interval <lb/>
            of peace, were free from apprehension, he possessed himself of <lb/>
            Syracuse by surprise.</p>
          <p>IV. While this affair occurred in Sicily, Hanno, a leading <lb/>
            man among the Carthaginians, in Africa, employed his power, <lb/>
            which surpassed that of the government, to secure the sove­ <lb/>
            reignty for himself, and endeavoured to establish himself as <lb/>
            king by killing the senate. For the execution of this atrocity <lb/>
            he fixed on the day of his daughter's marriage, in order that <lb/>
            his nefarious plot might be the better concealed in the pomp <lb/>
            of religious ceremonies. He accordingly prepared a banquet <lb/>
            for the common people in the public porticoes, and another for <lb/>
            the senate in his own house, so that, by poisoning the cups, <lb/>
            he might take off the senate privately and without witnesses, <lb/>
            and then more easily seize the government, when none were <lb/>
            left to prevent him.* The plot being disclosed to the magis­ <lb/>
            trates by his agents, his destructive intentions were frustrated, <lb/>
            but not punished, lest the matter, if publicly known, should <lb/>
            occasion more trouble, in the case of so powerful a man, than <lb/>
            the mere design of it had caused. Satisfied, therefore, with <lb/>
            putting a stop to it, they merely set bounds by a decree to the <lb/>
            expenses of marriage entertainments, and ordered the decree <lb/>
            to be obeyed, not by him alone, but universally, that nothing <lb/>
            personal to him, but the general correction of an abuse, might <lb/>
            seem to be intended. Prevented by this measure, he, for a <lb/>
            second attempt, raised the slaves, and appointing another day <lb/>
            for the massacre of the senate, but finding himself again be­ <lb/>
            trayed, he threw himself, for fear of being brought to trial, <lb/>
            into a strong fortress with a body of twenty thousand armed <lb/>
            slaves. Here, while he was soliciting the Africans, and the <lb/>
            king of the Moors, to join him, he was captured, and after <lb/>
            being scourged, having his eyes put out, and his arms and legs <lb/>
            broken, as if atonement was to be exacted from every limb, he <lb/>
            was put to death in the sight of the people, and his body, <lb/>
            mangled with stripes, was nailed to a cross. All his children <lb/>
            and relations, too, though guiltless, were delivered to the exe­ <lb/>
            cutioner, that no member of so nefarious a family might sur­ <lb/>
            vive either to imitate his villainy, or to revenge his death. <note type="footnote"> * Orbamque rempublicam—invaderet.] Orbam, destitute of defenders <lb/>

          <p><note type="margin">B.C. 342.] </note> V. Dionysius, in the meantime, being re-established in <lb/>
            Syracuse, and becoming every day more oppressive and cruel <lb/>
            to the people, was assailed by a new band of conspirators <lb/>
            Laying down the government, therefore, he delivered up the <lb/>
            city and army to the Syracusans, and, being allowed to take <lb/>
            his private property with him, went to live in exile at Corinth ; <lb/>
            where, looking on the lowest station as the safest, he humbled <lb/>
            himself to the very meanest condition of life. He was not <lb/>
            content with strolling about the streets, but would even stand <lb/>
            drinking in them; he was not satisfied with being seen in <lb/>
            taverns and impure houses, but would sit in them for whole <lb/>
            days. He would dispute with the most abandoned fellows <lb/>
            about the merest trifles, walk about in rags and dirt, and <lb/>
            afford laughter to others more readily than he would laugh at <lb/>
            them. He would stand in the shambles, devouring with his <lb/>
            eyes what he was not able to purchase ; he would wrangle with <lb/>
            the dealers before the ædiles, and do everything in such a <lb/>
            manner * as to appear an object of contempt rather than of <lb/>
            fear. At last he assumed the profession of a schoolmaster, <lb/>
            and taught children in the open streets, either that he might <lb/>
            continually be seen in public t by those who feared him, or <lb/>
            might be more readily despised by those who did not fear him; <lb/>
            for though he had still plenty of the vices peculiar to tyrants; <lb/>
            yet his present conduct was an affectation of vices,‡ and not <lb/>
            the effect of nature, and he adopted it rather from cunning <lb/>
            than from having lost the self-respect becoming a sovereign, <lb/>
            having experienced how odious the names of tyrants are, even <lb/>
            when they are deprived of power. He strove, therefore, to <lb/>
            diminish the odium incurred from his past by the contempti­ <lb/>
            bleness of his present life, not looking to honourable but to <lb/>
            safe practices. Yet amidst all these arts of dissimulation, he <lb/>
            was accused of aspiring to the sovereignty, and was left at <lb/>
            liberty only because he was despised.</p>
          <p>VI. During these proceedings, the Carthaginians, alarmed <lb/>
            at the rapid successes of Alexander the Great, and fearing <lb/>
            that he might resolve to annex Africa to his Persian empire, <lb/>

            sent Hamilcar, surnamed Rhodanus, a man remarkable for <lb/>
            wit and eloquence beyond others, to sound his intentions; for, <lb/>
            indeed, the capture of Tyro, their own parent city, and the <lb/>
            founding of Alexandria, as a rival to Carthage, on the confines <lb/>
            of Africa and Egypt, as well as the good fortune of the king, <lb/>
            whose ambition and success seemed to know no limit, raised <lb/>
            their apprehensions to an extreme height. Hamilcar, obtain­ <lb/>

            sented himself to Alexander as having been banished from his <lb/>
            country, and as having fled to him for refuge, offering, at the <lb/>
            same time, to serve as a soldier in the expedition against Car­ <lb/>
            thage. Having thus ascertained his views, he sent a full <lb/>
            account of them to his countrymen, inscribed on wooden <lb/>
            tablets, with blank wax spread over the writing. The Cartha­ <lb/>
            ginians, however, when he returned home after the death of <lb/>
            Alexander, put him to death, not only ungratefully but cruelly, <lb/>

            equal to that of the elder Dionysius, rose to royal dignity from <lb/>
            the lowest and meanest origin. He was born in Sicily, his <lb/>
            father being a potter, and spent a youth not more honourable <lb/>
            than his birth; for, being remarkable for beauty and graceful­ <lb/>
            ness of person, he supported himself a considerable time by <lb/>
            submitting to the infamous lust of others. When he had <note type="footnote"> * All that took place in Sicily from the year B.c. 342 to B.C. 316, <lb/>
            is omitted by Justin. During that period Timoleon, whom Justin <lb/>

            liberty to the whole island. See Plutarch, Cornelius Nepos, and <lb/>

            passed the years of puberty, he transferred his services from <lb/>
            men to women. Having thus become infamous with both <lb/>
            sexes, he next changed his way of life for that of a robber. <lb/>
            Some time after, having gone to Syracuse and been received <lb/>
            as a citizen among the other inhabitants, he was long without <lb/>
            credit, appearing to have as little of property to lose as he had <lb/>
            of character to blacken. At last, enlisting in the army as a <lb/>
            common soldier, he showed himself ready for every kind of <lb/>
            audacity, his life being then not less distinguished by restless­ <lb/>
            ness than it had previously been by infamy. He was noted <lb/>
            for activity in the field, and for eloquence in making harangues. <lb/>
            In a short time, accordingly, he became a centurion, and soon <lb/>
            after a tribune. In his first campaign against the people of <lb/>
            Ætna,* he gave the Syracusans great proofs of what he could <lb/>
            do; in the next, against the Campanians, he excited such hopes <lb/>
            of himself throughout the army, that he was chosen to fill the <lb/>
            place of the deceased general, Damascon, whose wife, after the <lb/>
            death of her husband, he married, having previously <unclear>and</unclear> a <lb/>
            criminal connection with her.[ And, not content that from <lb/>
            being poor he was suddenly made rich, he engaged in piracy <lb/>
            against his own country. He was saved from death by his <lb/>
            companions, who, when apprehended and put to the torture, <lb/>
            denied his guilt. Twice he attempted to make himself <lb/>
            sovereign of Syracuse, and twice he was driven into exile.</p>
          <p>II. By the Murgantines, with whom he took refuge in his <lb/>
            banishment, he was first, from hatred to the Syracusans, made <lb/>
            prætor, and afterwards general-in-chief. In the war which he <lb/>
            conducted for them, he both took the city of the Leontines, and <lb/>
            proceeded to besiege his native city, Syracuse; when Hamilcar, <lb/>
            general of the Carthaginians, being entreated to aid it, laid <lb/>
            aside his hatred as an enemy, and sent a body of troops <lb/>
            thither. Thus, at one and the same time, Syracuse was both <lb/>
            defended by an enemy with the love of a citizen, and attacked <lb/>
            by a citizen with the hatred of an enemy. But Agathocles, <lb/>
            seeing that the city was defended with more vigour than it was <lb/>
            assailed, entreated Hamilcar, through his deputies, to under­ <lb/>
            take the settlement of a peace between him and the <lb/>
            Syracusans, promising him particular services in return for <lb/>
            the favour. Hamilcar, induced by such hopes, and by dread of <note type="footnote"> * A dversus Ætnæos.] Ætna was a town at the foot of Mount AEtna, <lb/>
            not far from Catana. </note> <note type="footnote"> N </note> <pb n="178"/>

            his power, made an alliance with him, on condition that what <lb/>
            ever assistance he furnished Agathocles against the Syracusans, <lb/>
            he himself should receive as much for the augmentation of his <lb/>
            power at home. Not only peace, in consequence, was procured <lb/>
            for Agathocles, but he was also appointed prætor at Syracuse; <lb/>
            and he then swore to Hamilcar that he would be faithful to the <lb/>
            Carthaginians, the [sacred] fires, at the same time, being set <lb/>
            forth, and touched by him.* Some time after, having received <lb/>
            from Hamilcar five thousand African troops, he put to death <lb/>
            the most powerful of the leading citizens; and then, as if <lb/>
            intending to re-model the constitution, he ordered the people <lb/>
            to be summoned to an assembly in the theatre, convoking the <lb/>
            senate, in the meantime, in the Gymnasium, as though he <lb/>
            designed to make some previous arrangements with them. <lb/>
            His measures being thus taken, he sent his troops to surround <lb/>
            the people, and caused the senate to be massacred, and, when <lb/>
            he had finished the slaughter of them, cut off the richest and <lb/>
            boldest of the commoners.</p>
          <p>III. These things being done, he made choice of troops, <lb/>
            and embodied a regular army; with which he suddenly <lb/>
            attacked several of the neighbouring cities when they were <lb/>
            under no apprehension of hostilities. He also disgracefully <lb/>
            harassed, with the connivance of Hamilcar, certain allies of <lb/>
            the Carthaginians, who, in consequence, sent complaints to <lb/>
            Carthage, not so much against Agathocles as against Hamil <lb/>
            ear, accusing “the former, indeed, as an oppressor and tyrant, <lb/>
            but the latter as a traitor, by whom the possessions of their <lb/>
            allies, under a settled compact, were betrayed to the bitterest of <lb/>
            enemies; for as, at first, Syracuse (a city always hostile to the <lb/>
            Carthaginians, and a competitor with Carthage for the <note type="footnote"> * The text of Wetzel, with the older editions, has expositis ignibus <lb/>

            But it may be doubted whether those two words will fairly bear that <lb/>
            sense. Many other editions have ignibus Cereris, a conjecture of <lb/>
            Sebisius, which Berneccerus, Scheffer, and Faber approve, because <lb/>

            dominion of Sicily) was delivered to, Agathocles as a bond of <lb/>
            union with Hamilcar, so, at the present time, the cities of the <lb/>
            allies of Carthage were given up to the same tyrant under <lb/>
            pretence of making peace. They warned them, therefore, <lb/>
            that these proceedings would shortly come home to themselves, <lb/>
            and that they would feel what mischief they had brought,* not <lb/>
            more upon Sicily than upon Africa itself.” At these complaints <lb/>
            the senate was incensed against Hamilcar, but as he was in <lb/>
            command of the army, they gave their votes concerning him <lb/>
            secretly, and caused their several opinions, before they were <lb/>
            openly read, to be put in an urn, and sealed up, until the <lb/>
            other Hamilcar, the son of Gisco, should return from <lb/>
            Sicily. But the death of Hamilcar prevented all effects from <lb/>
            these subtle contrivances and suppressed judgments,! and <lb/>
            he, whom his fellow citizens had unjustly condemned unheard, <lb/>
            was freed from danger of punishment by the kindness of <lb/>
            destiny. The proceeding furnished Agathocles with a pretext <lb/>
            for making war on the Carthaginians. His first engagement <lb/>
            was with Hamilcar, the son of Gisco, by whom he was <lb/>
            defeated, and retired to Syracuse to prepare himself for war <lb/>
            with fresh vigour. But the result of his second encounter <lb/>
            was the same as that of the first.</p>
          <p>IV. The victorious Carthaginians, in consequence, having <lb/>
            invested Syracuse with a close siege, Agathocles, perceiving <lb/>
            that he was neither a match for them in the field, nor provided <lb/>
            for enduring a blockade, and being deserted, moreover, by <lb/>
            his allies, who were disgusted at his cruelties, resolved to <lb/>
            transfer tho war into Africa; a resolution formed with wonder­ <lb/>
            ful audacity, that he should make war on the city of a people <lb/>
            for whom he was not a match in his own city; that he who could <lb/>
            not defend his own country should invade that of others; and: <lb/>
            that one who had been conquered should brave his conquerors. <lb/>
            Nor was the secrecy of his plan less striking than the con­ <lb/>
            trivance of it. Stating merely to the people, that “he had <lb/>
            found out a way to victory, and that they had only to prepare <lb/>
            their minds to endure a, short siege, or that, if any of <lb/>
            them were dissatisfied with their present circumstances, he gave <lb/>
            them full liberty to, depart," he proceeded, after one thousand <note type="footnote"> * Namely, by sending out Hamilcar. </note><note type="footnote"> t Sententias inauditas.] Justin means the secret votes, of which be <lb/>

            six hundred had left him, to furnish the rest with provisions <lb/>
            and money for the necessities of a blockade, taking away with <lb/>
            him only fifty talents for present use, and intending to get <lb/>
            further supplies rather from his enemies than his friends. He <lb/>
            then obliged all the slaves that were of age for war, after <lb/>
            receiving their freedom, to take the military oath, and put <lb/>
            them and the greater part of the soldiers, on ship-board, sup­ <lb/>
            posing that, as the condition of both was made equal, there <lb/>
            would be a mutual emulation in bravery between them.</p>
          <p>V. In the seventh year of his reign, therefore, accompanied <lb/>
            by his two grown-up sons, Archagathus and Heraclides, he <lb/>
            directed his course towards Africa, not one of his men knowing <lb/>
            whither he was sailing; but while they all supposed that they <lb/>
            were going to Italy or Sardinia for plunder, he landed his <lb/>
            army on the coast of Africa, and then for the first time made <lb/>
            known his intentions to them all. He reminded them in <lb/>
            what condition Syracuse was, " for which there was no other <lb/>
            remedy but that they should inflict on the enemy the distresses <lb/>
            that they themselves were suffering. Wars," he said, “were <lb/>
            conducted in one way at home and in another abroad; at <lb/>
            home, a people's only support was what the resources of their <lb/>
            country supplied ; but abroad, the enemy might be beaten by <lb/>
            their own strength, while their allies fell off, and from hatred <lb/>
            of their long tyranny, looked about for foreign aid. To this <lb/>
            was added, that the cities and fortresses of Africa were not <lb/>
            secured with walls, or situate on eminences, but lay in level <lb/>
            plains without any fortifications, and might all be induced, <lb/>
            by the fear of destruction, to join in the war against Carthage. <lb/>
            A greater war, in consequence, would blaze forth against the <lb/>
            Carthaginians from Africa itself than from Sicily, as the <lb/>
            forces of the whole region would combine against a city <lb/>
            greater in name than in power, and he himself would thus <lb/>
            gain from the country the strength which he had not brought <lb/>
            into it. Nor would victory be only in a small degree pro­ <lb/>
            moted by the sudden terror of the Carthaginians, who, <lb/>
            astonished at such daring on the part of their enemies, would <lb/>
            be in utter consternation. Besides, there would be the <lb/>
            burning of country houses, the plundering of fortresses and <lb/>
            towns that offered resistance, and siege laid to Carthage <lb/>
            itself; from all which disasters they would learn that wars <lb/>
            were practicable not only for them against others, but for <pb n="181"/>
            <note type="margin"> B.C. 309.] </note> <lb/>
            others against them. By these means the Carthaginians <lb/>
            might not only be conquered, but Sicily might be delivered <lb/>
            from them; for they would not continue to besiege Syracuse, <lb/>
            when they were suffering from a siege of their own city. <lb/>
            Nowhere else, therefore, could war be found more easy, or <lb/>
            plunder more abundant, for, if Carthage were taken, all Africa <lb/>
            and Sicily would be the prize of the victors. The glory, too, <lb/>
            of so honourable an enterprise, would be so celebrated through <lb/>
            all ages, that it could never be buried in oblivion; for it <lb/>
            would be said that they were the only men in the world who <lb/>
            had carried abroad against their enemies a war which they <lb/>
            could not withstand at home ; who, when defeated, had pur­ <lb/>
            sued their conquerors, and besieged the besiegers of their own <lb/>
            city. They ought all accordingly, to prosecute, with equal <lb/>
            courage and cheerfulness, an enterprise, than which none <lb/>
            could offer them a more noble reward if they were victorious, <lb/>
            or greater honour to their memory if they were conquered.”</p>
          <p>VI. By these exhortations the courage of the soldiers was <lb/>
            excited; but the superstitious influence of an omen had spread <lb/>
            some dismay among them ; for the sun had been eclipsed* <lb/>
            during their voyage. But with regard to this phenomenon <lb/>
            Agathocles was at no less pains to satisfy them than he had <lb/>
            been with regard to the war ; alleging that, " if it had hap­ <lb/>
            pened before they set out, he should have thought it a portent <lb/>
            unfavourable to their departure, but since it had occurred after <lb/>
            they had set sail, its signification was directed against those <lb/>
            to whom they were going. Besides," he said, " the eclipses <lb/>
            of the heavenly bodies always presaged a change in the present <lb/>
            state of things, and it was therefore certain that an alteration <lb/>
            was foretold in the flourishing condition of the Carthaginians <lb/>
            and in their own adverse circumstances." Having thus <lb/>
            pacified his soldiers, he ordered all the ships, with the consent <lb/>
            of the army, to be set on fire, in order that, the means of <lb/>
            flight being taken away, they might understand that they must <lb/>
            either conquer or die.</p>
          <p>While they were devastating the country wherever they went, <lb/>
            and laying farm-nouses and fortresses in ashes, Hanno <lb/>
            advanced to meet them with thirty thousand Carthaginians. <note type="footnote"> * In the third year of the 117th olympiad, B.c. 309, on the <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.XXII. CH.VII."/> <lb/>
            When they came to a battle, two thousand of the Sicilians, <lb/>
            and three thousand of the Carthaginians, with their general <lb/>
            himself, were left on the field. By this victory the spirits <lb/>
            of the Sicilians were elated, and those of the Carthaginians <lb/>
            depressed. Agathocles, taking advantage of his success, <lb/>
            stormed several towns and forts, took a vast quantity of <lb/>
            plunder, and killed many thousands of the enemy. He then <lb/>
            pitched his camp at the distance of five miles from Carthage, <lb/>
            that they might view from the walls of the city the destruc­ <lb/>
            tion of their most valuable possessions, the devastation of their <lb/>
            lands, and the burning of their houses. At the same time a <lb/>
            great rumour of the destruction of the Carthaginian army, <lb/>
            and of the capture of their cities, was spread through all <lb/>
            Africa, and astonishment fell upon every one, wondering how <lb/>
            so sudden a war could have surprised so great an empire, <lb/>
            especially from an enemy already conquered. This wonder <lb/>
            was gradually changed into a contempt for the Carthaginians; <lb/>
            and not long after, not only the populace of Africa, but <lb/>
            the most eminent cities, out of fondness for change, revolted to <lb/>
            Agathocles, and furnished the victorious army with corn and <lb/>
            money.</p>
          <p>VII. To these disasters of the Carthaginians, and as if to <lb/>
            crown their evil fortune, was added the destruction of their <lb/>
            army and its general in Sicily. For after the departure of <lb/>
            Agathocles from the island, the Carthaginians, prosecuting the <lb/>
            siege of Syracuse with less vigour, were reported to have been <lb/>
            utterly cut off by Antander, the brother of Agathocles. The <lb/>
            fortune of the Carthaginians, therefore, being similar at home <lb/>
            and abroad, not only their tributary towns, but even princes <lb/>
            that were in alliance with them, began to fall off, estimating <lb/>
            the obligations of confederacy not by the standard of honour <lb/>
            but by that of fortune. Among these was Opheltas, king of <lb/>
            Cyrene, who, grasping, with extravagant hopes, at the do­ <lb/>
            minion of all Africa, made an alliance with Agathocles <lb/>
            through ambassadors, arranging that, when the Carthaginians <lb/>
            were subdued, the government of Sicily should fall to Aga­ <lb/>
            thocles, and that of Africa to himself. But when he came, <lb/>
            accordingly, with a numerous army, to take a share In the war, <lb/>
            Agathocles, after throwing him off his guard by the affability <lb/>
            of his address and the abjectness of his flattery, and after they <lb/>
            had supped together several times, and he had been adopted <pb n="183"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="B.C. 309—300.]"/> <lb/>
            by Opheltas as a son, put him to death, and taking the corn <lb/>
            mand of his forces, defeated the Carthaginians, who were <lb/>
            renewing the war with all their might, in a second great <lb/>
            battle, but with much loss to both armies. At this result of <lb/>
            the contest, such despair was felt by the Carthaginians, that, <lb/>
            had not a mutiny occurred among the troops of Agathocles, <lb/>
            Bomilcar, the Carthaginian general,. would have gone over to <lb/>
            him with his army. For this treachery be was nailed to a <lb/>
            cross by the Carthaginians in the middle of the forum, that <lb/>
            the place which had formerly been the distinguished scene of <lb/>
            his honours might also bear testimony to his punishment. <lb/>
            Bomilcar, however, bore the cruelty of his countrymen with <lb/>
            such fortitude, that from his cross, as if he bad been on a <lb/>
            judgment-seat, he inveighed against the injustice of the Car­ <lb/>
            thaginians, upbraiding them sometimes with " having cut off <lb/>
            Hanno,t on a false charge of aspiring to sovereignty;" some.. <lb/>
            times with “having banished the innocent Gisco ; ‡ and <lb/>
            sometimes with " having secretly condemned his uncle Ha­ <lb/>
            milcar,§ merely because he wished to make Agathocles their <lb/>
            ally rather than their enemy." After uttering these charges <lb/>
            with a loud voice, in a numerous assembly of the people, he <lb/>
            expired.</p>
          <p>VIlI. Agathocles, meanwhile, having overcome all oppo­ <lb/>
            sition in Africa, left the command of his army to his son <lb/>
            Archagathus, and went back to Sicily, thinking that all he <lb/>
            had done in Africa was as nothing, if Syracuse was still to be <lb/>
            besieged; for after the death of Hamilcar, the son of Gisco, a <lb/>
            fresh army had been sent thither by the Carthaginians. <lb/>
            Immediately on his arrival, all the cities of Sicily, having <lb/>
            previously heard of his achievements in Africa, unanimously <lb/>
            submitted to him; and being thus enabled to drive the Car­ <lb/>
            thaginians from Sicily, he made himself master of the whole <lb/>
            island. Returning afterwards to Africa, he was received by <lb/>
            his army in a state of mutiny; for the discharge of their <lb/>
            arrears of pay had been deferred by the son till the arrival of <lb/>
            his father. Summoning them, therefore, to a general assem­ <note type="footnote"> * Bomilcar, rex Pænorum.] He was one of the suffetes. See the first <lb/>

            bly, he proceeded to pacify them with soothing words, saying <lb/>
            that “ pay was not to be asked of him, but to be taken from <lb/>
            the enemy; that they must gain a common victory, and com­ <lb/>
            mon spoil; and that they must continue to support him for a <lb/>
            short time, till what remained of the war was finished, as they <lb/>
            were certain that the capture of Carthage would satisfy all their <lb/>
            desires." The mutiny being thus allayed, he led the army, <lb/>
            after an interval of some days, against the camp of the enemy, <lb/>
            but commencing an engagement too rashly, lost the greater <lb/>
            part of his force. Retreating to his camp, therefore, and find­ <lb/>
            ing the odium of his rash engagement affecting his character, <lb/>
            and dreading, at the same time, a revival of the former mur­ <lb/>
            murs at his failure in paying the arrears, he fled from his <lb/>
            camp at midnight, attended only by his son Archagathus. <lb/>
            When the soldiers heard of his departure, they were in no less <lb/>
            consternation than if they had been captured by the enemy, <lb/>
            exclaiming that “ they had been twice deserted by their leader <lb/>
            in the midst of the enemy's country, and that the care of their <lb/>
            lives had been abandoned by him by whom not even their <lb/>
            burial should have been neglected." As they were going to <lb/>
            pursue Agathocles, they were met by some Numidians, and <lb/>
            returned to the camp, but not without having seized and <lb/>
            brought back Archagathus, who, through mistaking his way in <lb/>
            the night, had been separated from his father. Agathocles, <lb/>
            with the ships in which he had returned from Sicily, and the <lb/>
            men that he had left to guard them, arrived safe at Syracuse; <lb/>
            affording a signal instance of dishonourable conduct, a prince <lb/>
            deserting his army, and a father abandoning his children.</p>
          <p>In Africa, meanwhile, after the flight of Agathocles, his <lb/>
            soldiers, making a capitulation with the enemy, and putting <lb/>
            to death the sons of Agathocles, surrendered themselves to the <lb/>
            Carthaginians. Archagathus, when he was going to be killed <lb/>
            by Arcesilaus, a former friend of his father, asked him “ what <lb/>
            he thought Agathocles would do to the children of him by <lb/>
            whom he was rendered childless?" Arcesilaus replied, that <lb/>
            “ he felt no concern, since he knew that his children would <lb/>
            certainly survive those of Agathocles." Some time after, the <lb/>
            Carthaginians sent new commanders into Sicily, to terminate <lb/>
            what remained of the war there, and Agathocles made peace <lb/>
            with them on equal terms. <pb n="185"/>

          <p>I. AGATHOCLES, sovereign of Sicily, having concluded a peace <lb/>
            with the Carthaginians, reduced, by force of arms, a part of <lb/>
            the cities which, presuming upon their strength, had thrown <lb/>
            off their allegiance to him. Then, as if he were confined <lb/>
            within too narrow limits in an island (a part of the dominion <lb/>
            of which, even when he first began to rise, he could scarcely <lb/>
            have hoped to obtain), he proceeded, after the example of <lb/>
            Dionysius,* who had subdued many cities of Italy, to cross <lb/>
            over into that country. His first enemies there were the <lb/>
            Bruttii, who, at that period, seem to have been the bravest <lb/>
            and most powerful people of the country, and to have been <lb/>
            extremely ready to attack their neighbours; for they had <lb/>
            driven the inhabitants of many of the Greek cities from Italy, <lb/>
            and had conquered in war the Lucanians their founders, and <lb/>
            made peace with them on equal terms; such being the fierce­ <lb/>
            ness of their nature, that they had no respect even for those <lb/>
            to whom they owed their origin.</p>
          <p>The Lucanians were accustomed to breed up their children <lb/>
            with the same kind of education as the Spartans; for, from <lb/>
            their earliest boyhood, they were kept in the wilds among the <lb/>
            shepherds, without any slaves to attend them, and even with­ <lb/>
            out clothes t to wear or to sleep upon, that, from their first <lb/>
            years, they might be accustomed to hardiness and spare diet, <lb/>
            having no intercourse with the city. Their food was what <lb/>
            they took in hunting, and their drink milk or water. Thus <lb/>
            were they prepared for the toils of war.</p>
          <p>Fifty of these people, who, at first, used to plunder the <lb/>
            lands of their neighbours, but who, as numbers flocked to join <note type="footnote"> * See xx. 1. </note><note type="footnote"> t Sine veste.] J. G. Grævius thinks it possible that we ought to read <lb/>

            may, as Scheffer suggests, be taken for without any outer garment, as <lb/>
            he was called nudus among the Romans who was clad only with the <lb/>
            tunica. </note> <pb n="186"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.XXIII. CH.I.</note> <lb/>
            them, increased in strength, and were tempted by hopes of <lb/>
            greater booty, disturbed the whole of the neighbouring coun­ <lb/>
            try ; and Dionysius, the tyrant of Sicily, being wearied with <lb/>
            complaints from his allies, had sent six hundred Africans to <lb/>
            put a stop to their ravages. But the marauders, having seized <lb/>
            a fort which the Africans had built, and which was betrayed <lb/>
            into their hands by a woman named Bruttia, proceeded to <lb/>
            build a city there for the shepherds, who, at the report of a <lb/>
            new settlement, came in numbers to join them ; and, from <lb/>
            the name of the woman, they called themselves Bruttii.</p>
          <p>Their first war was with the Lucanians, from whom tney <lb/>
            sprung. Encouraged by a victory over them, and making <lb/>
            peace on equal terms, they subdued the rest of their neigh­ <lb/>
            bours by force of arms, and acquired, in a short time, such <lb/>
            extraordinary strength, that they were thought formidable <lb/>
            even by princes. After some time, Alexander, king of Epi­ <lb/>
            rus,* coming into Italy with a great army to the aid of the <lb/>
            Greek cities, was cut off by them with all his force; and their <lb/>
            natural fierceness, increased by this success, was for a long <lb/>
            time terrible to all around them. At last Agathocles, being <lb/>
            importuned to come over, set sail, with the hope of enlarging <lb/>
            his dominions, from Sicily to Italy.</p>
          <p>II. At the first news of his arrival, the Bruttii, alarmed at <lb/>
            his name, sent ambassadors to solicit alliance and friendship <lb/>
            with him. Agathocles, inviting them to an entertainment, <lb/>
            that they might not see his army shipped over, and ap­ <lb/>
            pointing the next day for giving them audience, went off <lb/>
            immediately after the banquet in a vessel, and left them in the <lb/>
            lurch. But what followed this deceit was unhappy for him; <lb/>
            for the violence of a disease t which he contracted obliged him <lb/>
            a few days after to return to Sicily. Being affected by the <lb/>
            distemper through his whole body, and a pestilential humour <lb/>
            spreading through all his nerves and joints, he was tormented, <lb/>
            as it were, by an intestine war among all his members. As <lb/>
            his life was despaired of, a contention arose between his son <lb/>
            and grandson, each claiming the right of succession to his <note type="footnote"> * See xii. 1, 2 ; xviii. 1, 2. </note><note type="footnote"> t Occasioned by poison prepared for him and his son Agathocles by <lb/>

            power as if he were already dead; and the grandson, after <lb/>
            killing the son, got possession of the supreme dignity. Aga­ <lb/>
            thocles, therefore, when the pain of his disease and his anxiety <lb/>
            of mind were grown intolerable, the one being increased by <lb/>
            the severity of the other, resolved on embarking his wife <lb/>
            Texena, and two infant sons. that he had by her, with all his <lb/>
            treasure, and servants, and regal furniture (in which no king <lb/>
            at that time was richer), and sending her back to Egypt, from <lb/>
            whence he had received her, fearing that they would find the <lb/>
            usurper of his power their enemy. His wife, however, long <lb/>
            entreated that she might not be separated from her sick <lb/>
            husband, that the affliction of her departure might not be <lb/>
            added to the atrocities of his grandson, and that she might not <lb/>
            be made to appear as cruel in forsaking her husband as he in <lb/>
            attacking his grandfather; saying that, " by marrying him, she <lb/>
            not only engaged to share his good fortune, but all his fortune; <lb/>
            nor would she unwillingly purchase, with the hazard of her own <lb/>
            life, the privilege of receiving her husband's last breath, and of <lb/>
            performing, with all the care of conjugal duty and affection, <lb/>
            the last offices at his funeral, which, when she was gone, no one <lb/>
            would take upon himself to discharge." The little children, <lb/>
            at parting, embraced and clung to their father with doleful <lb/>
            lamentations ; while the wife, who was to see her husband no <lb/>
            more, could not desist from kissing him. Nor were the tears <lb/>
            of the old man less moving ; the children wept for their dying <lb/>
            father, the father for his banished children. They bewailed <lb/>
            the forlorn condition of their parent, a sick old man ; he <lb/>
            lamented that his offspring, born to the prospect of a throne, <lb/>
            should be left in want. At the same time the whole palace <lb/>
            resounded with the cries of those who were witnesses to so <lb/>
            cruel a separation. The necessity for departure, however, at <lb/>
            length put a stop to their weeping, and the death of the prince <lb/>
            followed the leave-taking of his children.</p>
          <p>During these occurrences, the Carthaginians, learning the <lb/>
            state of affairs in Sicily, and thinking that an opportunity was <lb/>
            afforded them of securing the whole island, crossed over to it <lb/>
            with a great force, and reduced several cities.</p>
          <p>III. At this time, too, Pyrrhus was engaged in a war with the <lb/>
            Romans, and, being entreated by the Sicilians, as has been said, <note type="footnote"> * Lest his grandson should put them to death. </note> <pb n="188"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.XXIII. CH.IV."/> <lb/>
            to come to their assistance,. and crossing, in consequence, over to <lb/>
            Syracuse, and taking several cities, received the title of king of <lb/>
            Sicily as well as of Epirus. Elated by this success, he destined <lb/>
            for his son Helenus the kingdom of Sicily, as an inheritance <lb/>
            from his grandfather (for he was the son of Agathocles's <lb/>
            daughter), and to Alexander that of Italy. He then fought <lb/>
            many successful battles with the Carthaginians; but, after a <lb/>
            time, ambassadors came to him from his Italian allies, <lb/>
            announcing that “ they could no longer withstand the Romans, <lb/>
            and that, unless he gave them assistance, they must submit." <lb/>
            Alarmed at this danger from another quarter, and uncertain <lb/>
            what to do, or whither first to direct his efforts, he took time, <lb/>
            while he was in suspense between the two, for consideration. <lb/>
            As the Carthaginians threatened him on one side, and the <lb/>
            Romans on the other, it seemed hazardous not to transport a <lb/>
            force into Italy, and more hazardous to withdraw troops from <lb/>
            Sicily, lest the one should be lost by not receiving assistance, <lb/>
            or the other by being deserted. In this conflict of perils, <lb/>
            the safer determination seemed to be, to bring the struggle to <lb/>
            an end, by exerting his utmost strength in Sicily, and then, <lb/>
            after having subdued the Carthaginians, to carry his victorious <lb/>
            army into Italy. He therefore fought a battle ; but, though <lb/>
            he had the advantage, yet, as he quitted Sicily, he seemed <lb/>
            to flee as one defeated; and his allies, in consequence, <lb/>
            revolted from him, and he lost his dominion in Sicily as <lb/>
            speedily and easily as he had obtained it.</p>
          <p>Experiencing no better success in Italy, he returned to <lb/>
            Epirus. His fortune, indeed, good and bad, was wonderful <lb/>
            for the examples which it gave of both. For as, at first, his <lb/>
            good fortune, when his attempts succeeded even beyond his <lb/>
            wishes, had procured him empire in Italy and Sicily, and so <lb/>
            many victories over the Romans; so now his adverse fortune, <lb/>
            overthrowing all that he had raised, as if to afford an illustra­ <lb/>
            tion of human instability, added to his failure in Sicily the <lb/>
            destruction of his fleet at sea, loss of honour in a battle with <lb/>
            the Romans, and an ignominious retreat out of Italy.</p>
          <p>IV. When Pyrrhus had withdrawn from Sicily, Hiero was <lb/>
            made governor of it; and such was the prudence he displayed <lb/>
            in his office, that, by the unanimous consent of all the cities, <note type="footnote"> * See xviii. 2, </note> <pb n="189"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="B.C. 478—467.]"/> <lb/>
            he was first made general against the Carthaginians, and soon <lb/>
            after king. The fortune of Hiero, in his infancy, had been <lb/>
            as it were a presage of his future dignity. He was the son of <lb/>
            Hierocles, a man of high rank, whose descent was traced from <lb/>
            Gelo an ancient prince of Sicily. His extraction on the <lb/>
            mothers side, however, was so mean as to be even dishonour­ <lb/>
            able ; for he was the child of a female slave, and was in <lb/>
            consequence exposed by his father as a disgrace to his family. <lb/>
            But, when he was thus left destitute of human aid, bees for <lb/>
            several days fed him with honey, which was heaped round <lb/>
            him as he lay. Hence his father, admonished by a com­ <lb/>
            munication from the soothsayers, who signified that sovereign <lb/>
            power was foreboded to the infant, took him home again, and <lb/>
            brought him up most carefully with the hope that he would <lb/>
            attain the promised honour. As he was learning his lesson <lb/>
            at school, too, among his equals in age, a wolf, that suddenly <lb/>
            appeared in the midst of the boys, snatched from him his <lb/>
            book. And when he was grown up, and commencing his first <lb/>
            campaign, an eagle settled on his shield, and an owl upon his <lb/>
            spear; a prodigy which indicated that he would be prudent <lb/>
            in counsel, active in the field, and a king. He fought <lb/>
            frequently, moreover, with persons that challenged him, and <lb/>
            always gained the victory; and he was presented by king <lb/>
            Pyrrhus with many military gifts. The handsomeness of his <lb/>
            person was remarkable, and his bodily strength wonderful. <lb/>
            He was affable in his address, just in his dealings, moderate <lb/>
            in command ; so that nothing kingly seemed wanting to him <lb/>
            but a kingdom.</p><pb n="190"/>

            kings, Ptolemy Ceraunus* and Antigonus, quarrelling and <lb/>
            going to war with one another in Greece, almost all the cities <lb/>
            of that country, under the Spartans as leaders, encouraged as <lb/>
            it were by the opportunity thus offered to entertain hopes of <lb/>
            recovering their liberty, and sending to each other ambassadors <lb/>
            by whom leagues might be formed to unite them, broke out <lb/>
            into hostilities; and, that they might not seem to commence <lb/>
            war with Antigonus, under whose dominion they were, they <lb/>
            attacked his allies the Ætolians, making it a pretext for war <lb/>
            with them, that they had taken possession of the Cirrhæan <lb/>
            plain, which by the unanimous consent of Greece had been <lb/>
            dedicated to Apollo. For their general in this war they <lb/>
            selected Areus, who, drawing together an army, laid waste the <lb/>
            towns and corn-fields lying in the plain, and burnt whatever <lb/>
            he was unable to carry off. When the shepherds of the <lb/>
            Ætolians beheld this destruction from their mountains, about <lb/>
            five hundred of them assembling together, attacked the <lb/>
            enemy as they were dispersed, and knew not what was the <lb/>
            number of their assailants (for the sudden alarm, and the <lb/>
            smoke of the fires, prevented them from ascertaining), and <lb/>
            having killed about nine thousand t of the depredators, put <lb/>
            the rest to flight. And when the Spartans afterwards renewed <lb/>
            the war, many of the states refused them their support, <lb/>
            thinking that they sought dominion for themselves, and not <lb/>
            liberty for Greece.</p>

            for the throne of Macedonia was concluded, for Ptolemy, <lb/>
            having routed Antigonus and made himself master of the <lb/>
            whole country, arranged a peace with Antiochus, and contracted <lb/>
            an affinity with Pyrrhus by giving him his daughter in <lb/>
            marriage.</p>
          <p>II. Having thus freed himself from the fear of foreign <lb/>
            enemies, he turned his impious and unprincipled mind to the <lb/>
            perpetration of wickedness at home, and contrived a plot <lb/>
            against his sister Arsinoë,* to deprive her sons of life, and <lb/>
            herself of the possession of the city of Cassandrea. His first <lb/>
            stratagem was to pretend love to his sister, and to seek her <lb/>
            hand in marriage, for he was unable to come at his sister's sons, <lb/>
            whose throne he had usurped, otherwise than by counterfeiting <lb/>
            affection for their mother. But the criminal intentions of <lb/>
            Ptolemy were understood by his sister. As she expressed <lb/>
            distrust of him, therefore, he assured her that “ he wished to <lb/>
            share the kingdom with her children, against whom he had not <lb/>
            taken arms because he wished to wrest the kingdom from <lb/>
            them, but that he might have it in his power to present them <lb/>
            with a portion of it. She might therefore send a person to <lb/>
            receive an oath from him, in whose presence he would bind <lb/>
            himself, before the gods of their country, by whatever <lb/>
            execrations she pleased." Arsinoë, not knowing what to do, <lb/>
            was afraid that if she sent any one, she would be deceived by <lb/>
            a false oath, and that, if she did not send, she would provoke <lb/>
            her brother's fury and cruelty. Fearing, therefore, less for <lb/>
            herself than her children, whom she thought she might protect <lb/>
            by the marriage, she sent Dion, one of her friends, to him. <lb/>
            Ptolemy, after conducting him into the most sacred temple of <lb/>
            Jupiter, held in high veneration from of old among the Mace­ <lb/>
            donians, took hold of the altar, and, touching the images and <lb/>
            couches of the gods, vowed, with unheard-of and most solemn <lb/>
            imprecations, that “ he sought a marriage with his sister in <lb/>
            true sincerity, and that he would give her the title of Queen, <lb/>
            nor would, to her dishonour, have any other wife, or any other <lb/>
            children than her sons." Arsinoë, being thus filled with hope, <lb/>
            and relieved from apprehensions, held a conference with her <lb/>
            brother in person, and as his looks and flattering glances <lb/>
            promised no less sincerity than his oath, she agreed to marry <note type="footnote"> * The widow of Lysimachus; see xvii. 2, and a. 3 of this book. </note> <pb n="192"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.XXIV. CH.IV. </note> <lb/>
            him, though her son Lysimachus* exclaimed that " there was <lb/>
            treachery at the bottom."</p>
          <p>III. The nuptials were celebrated with great magnificence <lb/>
            and general rejoicings. Ptolemy, before the assembled army, <lb/>
            placed a diadem on his sister's head, and saluted her with the <lb/>
            title of Queen. Arsinoë, overjoyed at the name, as having <lb/>
            regained what she had lost by the death of Lysimachus her <lb/>
            former husband, invited Ptolemy to her city Cassandrea; to <lb/>
            get possession of which city the plot was laid. Going thither <lb/>
            before her husband, she appointed a festival in the city against <lb/>
            his arrival, ordering the houses, temples, and all other places, <lb/>
            to be magnificently decorated, altars and victims to be every­ <lb/>
            where kept in readiness, and her sons, Lysimachus who was <lb/>
            sixteen years old, and Philip three years younger, both remark­ <lb/>
            able for their comeliness, to go to meet him with crowns on <lb/>
            their heads. Ptolemy, to conceal his treachery, caressing <lb/>
            them with eagerness, and beyond the warmth of real affection, <lb/>
            persisted for a long time in kissing them. But as soon as he <lb/>
            arrived at the gate, he ordered the citadel to be seized, and <lb/>
            the boys to be slain. They, fleeing to their mother, were slain <lb/>
            upon her lap, as she was embracing them; while Arsinoë ex­ <lb/>
            claimed, “ What monstrous crime had she committed, † either in <lb/>
            marrying or since her marriage?” She several times offered <lb/>
            herself to the assassins in the room of her children, and, em­ <lb/>
            bracing them, covered their bodies with her own, endeavouring <lb/>
            to receive the wounds intended for them. At last, deprived <lb/>
            even of the dead bodies of her sons, she was dragged out of <lb/>
            the city, with her garments torn and her hair dishevelled, and <lb/>
            with only two attendants, and went to live in exile in <lb/>
            Samothracia ; sorrowing the more, that she was not allowed to <lb/>
            die with her children. But the crimes of Ptolemy were not <lb/>
            unpunished; for soon after (the immortal gods inflicting <lb/>
            vengeance on him for so many perjuries, and such cruel <lb/>
            murders), he was driven from his throne and taken prisoner by <lb/>
            the Gauls, and lost his life, as he had merited, by the sword.</p>
          <p>IV. The Gauls, when the land that had produced them was <lb/>
            unable, from their excessive increase of population, to contain <lb/>
            them, sent out three hundred thousand men, as a sacred spring, ‡ <note type="footnote">* Most other editions have Ptolemœus. </note><note type="footnote"> t Sc.

             <note type="margin">B.C. 278.] </note> <lb/>
            to seek new settlements. Of these adventurers part settled <lb/>
            in Italy, and took and burnt the city of Rome; and part <lb/>
            penetrated into the remotest parts of Illyricum under the <lb/>
            direction of a flight of birds (for the Gauls are skilled in <lb/>
            augury beyond other nations), making their way amidst great <lb/>
            slaughter of the barbarous tribes, and fixed their abode in <lb/>
            Pannonia. They were a savage, bold, and warlike nation, <lb/>
            and were the first after Hercules (to whom that undertaking <lb/>
            procured great admiration for his valour, and a belief in his <lb/>
            immortality), to pass the unconquered heights of the Alps, <lb/>
            and places uninhabitable from excess of cold. After <lb/>
            having subdued the Pannonians, they carried on various wars <lb/>
            with their neighbours for many years. Success encouraging <lb/>
            them, they betook themselves, in separate bands, some to <lb/>
            Greece, and some to Macedonia, laying waste all before them <lb/>
            with the sword. Such indeed was the terror of the Gallic <lb/>
            name, that even kings, before they were attacked, purchased <lb/>
            peace from them with large sums of money. Ptolemy alone, <lb/>
            the king of Macedonia, heard of the approach of the Gauls <lb/>
            without alarm, and, hurried on by the madness that distracted <lb/>
            him for his unnatural crimes, went out to meet them with a <lb/>
            few undisciplined troops, as if wars could be despatched with <lb/>
            as little difficulty as murders. An embassy from the Dar­ <lb/>
            danians, offering him twenty thousand armed men for his <lb/>
            assistance, he spurned, adding insulting language, and saying <lb/>
            that "the Macedonians were in a sad condition, if, after <lb/>
            having subdued the whole east without assistance, they now <lb/>
            required aid from the Dardanians to defend their country ; <lb/>
            and that he had for soldiers the sons of those who had served <lb/>
            under Alexander the Great, and had been victorious throughout <note type="footnote">the Italians; for when in great peril they used to vow that they would <lb/>
            sacrifice whatever animals should be born in their country in the <lb/>
            following spring. But as it seemed cruel to sacrifice children, they <lb/>
            allowed them to grow up, and then threw a veil over them, and con­ <lb/>
            ducted them beyond the boundaries of the country. Festus, sub “ver <lb/>
            sacrum ;” see also sub " Mamertius." This custom was not confined <lb/>
            to the Italians, but prevailed, says Dionys. Halicar. i. 5, " among many <lb/>
            people, Greek and barbarian." It seems to have been not uncommon <lb/>
            among the homans; Liv. xxii. 9; xxxiv. 44. See also Plin. H. N. <lb/>
            iii. 13. Ver sacrum, it should be observed, is an emendation of <lb/>
            Pithœus (Adversar. i. 6) for peregrinatum, concerning the justice of <lb/>
            which no editor has doubted, though Wetzel has thought proper to <lb/>

            the world." This answer being related to the Dardanian <lb/>
            prince, he observed that “ the famous kingdem of Macedonia <lb/>
            would soon fall a sacrifice to the rashneso of a raw youth."*</p>
          <p>V. The Gauls, under the command of Belgius, sent depu. <lb/>
            ties to Ptolemy to sound the disposition of the Macedonians, <lb/>
            offering him peace if he liked to purchase it; but Ptolemy <lb/>
            boasted to his courtiers that the Gauls sued for peace from <lb/>
            fear of war. Nor was his manner less vaunting before the <lb/>
            ambassadors than before his own adherents, saying that “ he <lb/>
            would grant peace only on condition that they would give their <lb/>
            chiefs as hostages, and deliver up their arms; for he would <lb/>
            put no trust in them until they were disarmed. It The do <lb/>
            puties bringing back this answer, the Gauls laughed, and <lb/>
            exclaimed throughout their camp, that " he would soon see <lb/>
            whether they had offered peace from regard for themselves <lb/>
            or for him." Some days after a battle was fought, and the <lb/>
            Macedonians were defeated and cut to pieces. Ptolemy, after <lb/>
            receiving several wounds, was taken, and his head, cut off and <lb/>
            stuck on a lance, was carried round the whole army to strike <lb/>
            terror into the enemy. Flight saved a few of the Macedo­ <lb/>
            nians ; the rest were either taken or slain.</p>
          <p>When the news of this event was spread through all Mace­ <lb/>
            donia, the gates of the city were shut, and all places filled with <lb/>
            mourning. Sometimes they lamented their bereavement, from <lb/>
            the loss of their children ; sometimes they were seized with <lb/>
            dread, lest their cities should be destroyed; and at other times <lb/>
            they called on the names of their kings, Alexander and Philip, <lb/>
            as deities, to protect them; saying that “ under them they were <lb/>
            not only secure, but conquerors of the world ;" and begging <lb/>
            that " they would guard their country, whose fame they had <lb/>
            raised to heaven by the glory of their exploits, and give <lb/>
            assistance to the afflicted, whom the insanity and rashness of <lb/>
            Ptolemy had ruined." While all were thus in despair, Sosthenes, <lb/>
            one of the Macedonian chiefs, thinking that nothing would be <lb/>
            effected by prayers, assembled such as were of age for war, <lb/>
            repulsed the Gauls in the midst of their exultation at their <lb/>
            victory, and saved Macedonia from devastation. For these <note type="footnote"> * Immaturi juvenis.] Although Ptolemy was rash, he could not be <lb/>

            great services, he, though of humble extraction, was chosen <lb/>
            before many nobles that aspired to the throne of Macedonia. <lb/>
            But though he was saluted as king by the army, he made the <lb/>
            soldiers take an oath to him, not as king, but as general.</p>
          <p>VI. In the meantime Brennus, under whose command a <lb/>
            part of the Gauls had made an irruption into Greece, having <lb/>
            heard of the success of their countrymen, who, under the <lb/>
            leadership of Belgius, had defeated the Macedonians, and <lb/>
            being indignant that so rich a booty, consisting of the spoils <lb/>
            of the east, had been so lightly abandoned, assembled an army <lb/>
            of a hundred and fifty thousand foot and fifteen thousand <lb/>
            horse, and suddenly invaded Macedonia. As he was laying <lb/>
            waste the fields and villages, Sosthenes met him with his <lb/>
            army of Macedonians in full array, but being few in number, <lb/>
            and in some consternation, they were easily overcome by <lb/>
            the more numerous and powerful Gauls; and the defeated <lb/>
            Macedonians retiring within the walls of their cities, the <lb/>
            victorius Brennus, meeting with no opposition, ravaged the <lb/>
            lands throughout the whole of Macedonia. Soon after, as if <lb/>
            the spoils of mortals were too mean for him, he turned his <lb/>
            thoughts to the temples of the immortal gods, saying, with a <lb/>
            profane jest, that “ the gods, being rich, ought to be liberal to <lb/>
            men." He suddenly, therefore, directed his march towards <lb/>
            Delphi, regarding plunder more than religion, and caring for <lb/>
            gold more than for the wrath of the deities, “ who," he said, <lb/>
            “stood in no need of riches, as being accustomed rather to <lb/>
            bestow them on mortals."</p>
          <p>The temple of Apollo at Delphi is situate- on Mount Par­ <lb/>
            nassus, on a rock steep on all sides. A concourse of people, <lb/>
            who, collecting from the parts around, through venerationt for <lb/>
            the majesty of the god, settled on the rock, formed a city <lb/>
            there. Thus, not walls, but precipices, not defences formed <lb/>
            by the hand, but by nature, protect the temple and the city; <lb/>
            so that it is utterly uncertain whether the strength of the <note type="footnote"> * Concerning the temple of Apollo at Delphi, see Pausan. x. 6; <lb/>

            place, or the influence of the deity residing in it. attracts <lb/>
            more admiration. The central part of the rock falls back in <lb/>
            the shape of an amphitheatre; and, in consequence, if ever <lb/>
            shouts are raised, or if the noise of trumpets is mingled with <lb/>
            them, the sound, from the rocks echoing and re-echoing to one <lb/>
            another, is heard many times repeated, and louder than it was <lb/>
            made at first. This effect, on those who are ignorant of its <lb/>
            cause, and are struck with wonder at it, produces a greater awe <lb/>
            of the power of the god. In the winding of the rock, about <lb/>
            half way up the hill, there is a small plain, and in it a <lb/>
            deep fissure in the ground, which is open for giving oracles; <lb/>
            for a cold exhalation, driven upwards by some force, as it were <lb/>
            by a wind, produces in the minds of the priestesses a certain <lb/>
            madness, and compels them, filled with the influence of the <lb/>
            god, to give answers to such as consult them. Hence many <lb/>
            rich presents of kings and nations are to be seen there, which, <lb/>
            by their magnificence, testify the grateful feelings of those <lb/>
            that have paid their vows, and their belief in the oracles given <lb/>
            by the deity.</p>
          <p>VII. Brennus, when he came within sight of the temple, <lb/>
            deliberated for some time, whether he should at once make an <lb/>
            attempt upon it, or should allow his soldiers, wearied with their <lb/>
            march, a night to refresh themselves. Two of the captains, <lb/>
            Emanus and Thessalorus, who had joined him for a share in <lb/>
            the booty, advised that " no delay should be made," while the <lb/>
            enemy were unprovided for defence, and the alarm at their <lb/>
            coming still fresh; that in the interval of a night, the courage <lb/>
            of the enemy would perhaps revive, and assistance come to <lb/>
            them; and that the approaches, which were now open, might <lb/>
            be blocked up." But the common soldiers, when, after a long <lb/>
            endurance of scarcity, they found a country abounding with <lb/>
            wine and other provisions, had dispersed themselves over the <lb/>
            fields, rejoicing as much at the plenty as if they had gained <lb/>
            a victory, and leaving their standards deserted, wandered about <lb/>
            to seize on everything like conquerors. This conduct gave <lb/>
            some respite to the Delphians. At the first report that the <lb/>
            Gauls were approaching, the country people are said to have <lb/>
            been prohibited by the oracle from carrying away their corn <lb/>
            and wine from their houses. The salutariness of this prohibi­ <lb/>
            tion was not understood, until, through this abundance of wine <lb/>
            and other provisions being thrown in the way of the Gauls, as <pb n="197"/>
            <note type="margin"> B.C. 278.] </note> <lb/>
            a stop to their progress, reinforcements from their neighbours <lb/>
            had time to collect. The Delphians, accordingly, supported <lb/>
            by the strength of their allies, secured their city before the <lb/>
            Gauls, who clung to the wine-skins, on which they had seized, <lb/>
            could be recalled to their standards. Brennus had sixty-five <lb/>
            thousand infantry, selected from his whole army ; of the Del­ <lb/>
            phians there were not more than four thousand ; in utter con <lb/>
            tempt of whom, Brennus, to rouse the courage of his men, <lb/>
            pointed to the vast quantity of spoil before them, declaring <lb/>
            that the statues, and four-horse chariots, of which a great <lb/>
            number were visible at a distance, were made of solid gold, <lb/>
            and would prove greater prizes when they came to be weighed <lb/>
            than they were in appearance.</p>
          <p>VIII. The Gauls, animated by these assertions, and dis­ <lb/>
            ordered, at the same time, with the wine which they had <lb/>
            drunk the day before, rushed to battle without any fear of <lb/>
            danger. The Delphians, on the other hand, placing more <lb/>
            confidence in the god than in their own strength, resisted <lb/>
            the enemy with contempt, and, from the top of the hill, <lb/>
            repelled the Gauls as they climbed up, partly with pieces of <lb/>
            rock, and partly with their weapons. Amidst this contest <lb/>
            between the two, the priests of all the temples,* as well as the <lb/>
            priestesses themselves, with their hair loose, and with their <lb/>
            decorations and fillets, rushed, trembling and frantic, into the <lb/>
            front ranks of the combatants, exclaiming that " the god was <lb/>
            come; that they had seen him leap down into his temple <lb/>
            through the opening roof; that, while they were all humbly <lb/>
            imploring aid of the deity, a youth of extraordinary beauty, far <lb/>
            above. that of mortals, and two armed virgins, coming from <lb/>
            the neighbouring temples of Diana and Minerva, met them; <lb/>
            that they had not only perceived them with their eyes, but <lb/>
            had heard also the sound of a bow and the rattling of arms <lb/>
            and they therefore conjured them with the strongest entreaties, <lb/>
            " not to delay, when the gods were leading them on, to spread <lb/>
            slaughter among the enemy, and to share the victory with <lb/>
            the powers of heaven." Incited by these exhortations, they <lb/>
            all rushed eagerly to the field of battle, where they themselves <lb/>
            also soon perceived the presence of the divinity; for a part of <lb/>

            host of the Gauls, and some of the densest bodies of the <lb/>
            enemy were scattered abroad, not without wounds, and fell to <lb/>
            the earth. A tempest then followed, which destroyed, with <lb/>
            bail and cold, those that were suffering from bodily injuries. <lb/>
            The general Brennus himself, unable to endure the pain of <lb/>
            his wounds, ended his life with his dagger. The other gene­ <lb/>
            ral,* after punishing the advisers of the war,t made off from <lb/>
            Greece with all expedition, accompanied with ten thousand <lb/>
            wounded men. But neither was fortune more favourable to <lb/>
            those who fled; for in their terror, they passed no night under <lb/>
            shelter, and no day without hardship and danger; and con­ <lb/>
            tinual rains, snow congealed by the frost, famine, fatigue, and, <lb/>
            what was the greatest evil, the constant want of sleep, con­ <lb/>
            sumed the wretched remains of the unfortunate army. The <lb/>
            nations and people too, through whom they marched, pursued <lb/>
            their stragglers, as if to spoil them. Hence it happened that, <lb/>
            of so great an army, which a little before, presuming on its <lb/>
            strength, contended even against the gods, not a man was left ‡ <lb/>
            to be a memorial of its destruction.</p>

          <p>I. AFTER peace was made between the two kings, Antigonus <lb/>
            and Antiochus, a new enemy suddenly started up against <lb/>
            Antigonus as he was returning to Macedonia. The Gauls, <lb/>
            who had been left behind by their general Brennus, when he <lb/>
            marched into Greece, to defend the borders of their country, <lb/>
            armed fifteen thousand foot and three thousand horse (that <lb/>
            they alone might not seem idle), and having routed the forces <lb/>
            of the Getæ and Triballi, and preparing to invade Macedonia, <lb/>
            sent ambassadors to Antigonus to offer him peace if he would pay <note type="footnote"> * A Iter ex ducibus ] That is, the other of the two generals; we are <lb/>

            for it, and to play the part of spies, at the same time, in his <lb/>
            camp. Antigonus, with royal munificence, invited them to <lb/>
            a banquet, and entertained them with a sumptuous display <lb/>
            of luxuries. But the Gauls were so struck with the vast <lb/>
            quantity of gold and silver set before them, and so <lb/>
            tempted with the richness of such a spoil, that they re­ <lb/>
            turned more inclined to war than they had come. The king <lb/>
            had also ordered his elephants to be shown them, as monsters <lb/>
            unknown to those barbarians, and his ships laden with stores <lb/>
            to be displayed ; little thinking that he was thus exciting the <lb/>
            cupidity of those to seize his treasures, whom he sought to <lb/>
            strike with terror by the ostentation of his strength. The <lb/>
            ambassadors, returning to their countrymen, and exaggerating <lb/>
            every thing excessively, set forth at once the wealth and un­ <lb/>
            suspiciousness of the king; saying that “ his camp was filled <lb/>
            with gold and silver, but secured neither by rampart nor trench, <lb/>
            and that the Macedonians, as if they had sufficient protec­ <lb/>
            tion in their wealth, neglected all military duties, apparently <lb/>
            thinking that, as they had plenty of gold, they had no use for <lb/>
            steel.”</p>
          <p>II. By this statement, the desires of a covetous people were <lb/>
            sufficiently stimulated to take possession of such spoil. The <lb/>
            example of Belgius, too, had its influence with them, who, a <lb/>
            little before, had cut to pieces the army of the Macedonians <lb/>
            and their king. Being all of one mind, therefore, they attacked <lb/>
            the kings camp by night; but he, foreseeing the storm that <lb/>
            threatened him, had given notice to his soldiers to remove all <lb/>
            their baggage, and to conceal themselves noiselessly in a neigh­ <lb/>
            bouring wood; and the camp was only saved because it was <lb/>
            deserted. The Gauls, when they found it destitute not only of de­ <lb/>
            fenders, but of sentinels, suspecting that there was not a flight, <lb/>
            but some stratagem on the part of the enemy, were for some <lb/>
            time afraid to enter the gates. At last, leaving the defences <lb/>
            entire and untouched, and more like men come to explore than <lb/>
            to plunder, they took possession of the camp ; and then, carry­ <lb/>
            ing off what they found, they directed their course towards <lb/>
            the coast. Here, as they were incautiously plundering the <lb/>
            vessels, and fearing no attack, they were cut down by the <lb/>
            sailors, and a part of the army that had fled thither with their <lb/>
            wives and children; and such was the slaughter among them <lb/>
            that the report of this victory procured Antigonus peace, not <pb n="200"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.XXV. CH.III </note> <lb/>
            only from the Gauls, but from his other barbarous neigh- <lb/>
            hours.</p>
          <p>The nation of the Gauls, however, was at that time so <lb/>
            prolific, that they filled all Asia as with one swarm. Th <lb/>
            kings of the east then carried on no wars without a mercenary <lb/>
            army of Gauls; nor, if they were driven from their thrones, <lb/>
            did they seek protection with any other people than the Gauls. <lb/>
            Such indeed was the terror of the Gallic name, and the unvaried <lb/>
            good fortune of their arms, that princes thought they could <lb/>
            neither maintain their power in security, nor recover it if <lb/>
            lost, without the assistance of Gallic valour. Hence, being <lb/>
            called by the king of Bithynia to his aid, and having gained <lb/>
            him the victory over his enemies, they shared his kingdom with <lb/>
            him. and called their part of it Gallogræcia.</p>
          <p>III. During these transactions in Asia, Pyrrhus, having <lb/>
            been defeated by the Carthaginians in a sea-6ght on the coast <lb/>
            of Sicily, sent ambassadors to Antigonus king of Macedonia, <lb/>
            to ask for a supply of troops, saying that, "unless he sent him <lb/>
            some, he should be obliged to return to his kingdom, and to <lb/>
            seek that enlargement of his dominions from him,* which he <lb/>
            had wished to gain from the Romans." The ambassadors <lb/>
            bringing word that his request was refused, he pretended to <lb/>
            be suddenly obliged to depart, but concealed his reasons for <lb/>
            doing so. Meanwhile he directed his allies to prepare for war, <lb/>
            and committed the citadel of Tarentum to the guardianship of <lb/>
            his son Helenus and his friend Milo. Returning to Epirus, <lb/>
            he immediately invaded Macedonia ; Antigonus met him with <lb/>
            an army, but was defeated in battle, and put to flight. Pyrrhus <lb/>
            then allowed the Macedonians to surrender on terms ; and as <lb/>
            if, by the acquisition of Macedonia, he had made up for his <lb/>
            loss of Sicily and Italy, he sent for his son and his friend, <lb/>
            whom he had left at Tarentum. Antigonus, divesting himself <lb/>
            at once of all the marks of royalty, repaired with a few horse­ <lb/>
            men, thit attended him in his flight, to Thessalonica, there to <lb/>
            watch what would follow on the loss of his throne, and to renew <lb/>
            the war with a hired army of Gauls. But being utterly de­ <lb/>
            feated, a second time, by Ptolemy the son of Pyrrhus, he fled <note type="footnote"> * De ipso.] He signified that if Antigonus did not send him succour <lb/>
            he should be obliged toreturn home, and that he would then make <lb/>
            war on Antigonus, with a view to that enlargement of his dominions <lb/>
            which he had wished to make at the cost of the Romana. — Lemaire. </note> <pb n="201"/>

            with only seven followers, and no longer indulged hopes ot <lb/>
            recovering his kingdom, but sought only hiding places for safety <lb/>
            and solitary ways for flight.</p>
          <p>IV. Pyrrhus, being raised to such a height of royal power. <lb/>
            and not content with what had once been the object of his <lb/>
            wishes, began to contemplate the subjugation of Greece and <lb/>
            Asia. He had no greater delight in ruling than in warfare; nor <lb/>
            was any power able to withstand him, wheresoever he directed <lb/>
            his attack. But irresistible as he was deemed in conquering <lb/>
            kingdoms, he also easily lost those which he subdued and ac­ <lb/>
            quired, so much better did he manage to gain dominion than <lb/>
            to keep it.</p>
          <p>Having led his army into the Peloponnesus,* he was met by <lb/>
            embassies from the Athenians, Achæans, and Messenians; <lb/>
            and all Greece, indeed, struck with admiration at his name, <lb/>
            and at the glory of his achievements against the Romans and <lb/>
            Carthaginians, was eagerly looking for his arrival. His first <lb/>
            contest was with the Spartans, in which, being resisted with <lb/>
            greater spirit by the women than by the men, he lost his son <lb/>
            Ptolemy and the flower of his army ; for, when he proceeded <lb/>
            to attack the city, such a number of women assembled to de­ <lb/>
            fend their birth-place, that he retreated, overcome not more <lb/>
            by bravery on their part than by shame on his own.</p>
          <p>As for his son Ptolemy, he is said to have been so brave and <lb/>
            enterprising that he took the city of Corcyrat with only sixty <lb/>
            men. In a naval engagement, too, he is reported to have <lb/>
            leaped from a boat, with seven men, into a fifty-oared galley, <lb/>
            and to have taken and kept possession of it. At the attack <lb/>
            on Sparta he rode into the very middle of the city, and was <lb/>
            there slain in a crowd that gathered around him. When his <lb/>
            body was carried to his father, he exclaimed, it is said, “ that <lb/>
            he had not been killed so soon as he had feared, or his own <lb/>
            rashness deserved."</p>
          <p>V. Pyrrhus, on being repulsed by the Spartans, marched to <lb/>
            Argos, where, while he was endeavouring to capture Antigonus <note type="footnote"> * Cherroneson.] The old reading was Cherroneso, which was con­ <lb/>

            who was snut up in the city, and was fighting furiously among <lb/>
            the thickest of the assailants, he was struck with a stone from <lb/>
            the walls, and killed. His head was carried to Antigonus, <lb/>
            who, using his victory with moderation, sent back his son <lb/>
            Helenus, who surrendered to him with several Epirots, into <lb/>
            his own country, and gave him the bones of his father, not <lb/>
            having yet received the rites of burial, to carry home with <lb/>
            him.</p>
          <p>It is pretty generally stated by authors, that no king, either <lb/>
            of that or the former age, was to be compared to Pyrrhus; <lb/>
            and that there has seldom been seen, either among princes, or <lb/>
            other illustrious men, a man of more upright life or of stricter <lb/>
            justice; and that he had such knowledge of the military art, <lb/>
            that though he fought against such great princes as Lysi­ <lb/>
            machus, Demetrius, and Antigonus, he was never conquered. <lb/>
            In his wars too with the Illyrians, Sicilians, Romans, and <lb/>
            Carthaginians, he never came off inferior, but generally vic­ <lb/>
            torious ; and he rendered his country, which was before but <lb/>
            mean and obscure, renowned throughout the world by the <lb/>
            fame of his exploits and the glory of his name.</p>

          <p>I. AFTER the death of Pyrrhus, there were great warlike <lb/>
            commotions, not only in Macedonia, but in Asia and Greece; <lb/>
            for the Peloponnesians were betrayed into the power of Anti­ <lb/>
            gonus; and while partly concern, partly exultation, prevailed <lb/>
            variously among the inhabitants, as any city had either ex­ <lb/>
            pected aid from Pyrrhus or conceived apprehensions of him, <lb/>
            they either entered into alliance with Antigonus, or, impelled <lb/>
            by mutual animosity, plunged into hostilities with one another <lb/>
            Amidst these tumults in the disturbed provinces, the sove­ <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> B.C. 271.] </note> <lb/>
            nent man named Aristotimus; and when many of the leafing <lb/>
            persons had been slain by him, and more driven into banish­ <lb/>
            ment, and the Ætolians sent ambassadors to ask him “to <lb/>
            give up the wives and children of the exiles," he at first <lb/>
            refused, but afterwards, as if relenting, he gave all the married <lb/>
            women leave to go to their husbands, and fixed a day for their <lb/>
            departure. They, as being about to spend their lives in <lb/>
            banishment with their husbands, were going to carry all their <lb/>
            most valuable property with them; but, when they assembled <lb/>
            at one of the gates of the city, intending to go forth in a body, <lb/>
            they were despoiled of all that they had, and confined in the <lb/>
            public prison, the infants having been first killed in the arms <lb/>
            of their mothers, and the young women carried off for vio­ <lb/>
            lation. The people being all amazed at such cruel tyranny, <lb/>
            Hellanicus, the chief of them, an old man and without chil­ <lb/>
            dren, and consequently having no fear either for life or <lb/>
            offspring, assembled the most faithful of his friends in his <lb/>
            house, and encouraged them to attempt the delivery of their <lb/>
            country. But as they hesitated to remove a public evil at <lb/>
            their own private risk, and demanded time for deliberation, <lb/>
            Hellanicus, calling for his attendants, ordered the doors to be <lb/>
            locked, and a message to be carried to the tyrant, requesting <lb/>
            him " to send officers to seize a band of conspirators in Hel­ <lb/>
            lanicus's house;" and he told all of them, with reproaches, <lb/>
            that “ since he could not be the deliverer of his country, he <lb/>
            would at least take revenge for the abandonment of its cause.” <lb/>
            Being thus placed between two perils, they chose the more <lb/>
            honourable course, and conspired to kill the tyrant; and thus <lb/>
            Aristotimus was cut off in the fifth month after he had usurped <lb/>
            the government.</p>
          <p>II. In the meantime Antigonus, being harassed with wars, <lb/>
            of varied aspect, from the Spartans and King Ptolemy, and per­ <lb/>
            ceiving that a new enemy, an army from Gallogræcia, was <lb/>
            coming upon him, left a few troops as a semblance of a camp, <lb/>
            to amuse his other assailants, and proceeded with all the rest <lb/>
            of his force against the Gauls; who, becoming aware of his <lb/>
            approach, as they were preparing for battle, sacrificed victims <note type="footnote"> of Elis, contemporary with Pelops, Horn. Odyss. xiii. 275; xv. 297; so <lb/>

            to take presages for the event; and as, from the entrails, great <lb/>
            slaughter and destruction of them all was portended, they were <lb/>
            moved, not to fear, but to fury, and thinking that the anger of <lb/>
            the gods might be appeased by the slaughter of their kindred, <lb/>
            butchered their wives and children, commencing hostilities with <lb/>
            the murder of their own people ; for such rage had possessed <lb/>
            their savage breasts, that they did not spare even that tender age <lb/>
            which an enemy would have spared, but made deadly war on their <lb/>
            own children and their children's mothers, in defence of whom <lb/>
            wars are wont to be undertaken. As if, therefore, they had <lb/>
            purchased life and victory by their barbarity, they rushed, <lb/>
            stained as they were with the fresh blood of their relatives, into <lb/>
            the field of battle, but with success no better than their <lb/>
            auspices : for, as they were fighting, the furies, the avengers <lb/>
            of murder, overwhelmed them sooner than the enemy, and <lb/>
            the ghosts of the slain rising up before their eyes, they were <lb/>
            all cut off with utter destruction. Such was the havoc <lb/>
            among them, that the gods seemed to have conspired with <lb/>
            men to annihilate an army of murderers.</p>
          <p>In consequence of the result of this battle,Ptolemy and the <lb/>
            Spartans, avoiding the victorious army of the enemy, retreated <lb/>
            to safer ground; and Antigonus, when he heard of their <lb/>
            departure, turned his arms against the Athenians, while the <lb/>
            ardour of his men was yet fresh from their recent victory. <lb/>
            But during the time that he was thus engaged, Alexander, king <lb/>
            of Epirus, longing to avenge the death of his father Pyrrhus, <lb/>
            laid waste the frontiers of Macedonia. Antigonus returned <lb/>
            from Greece to give him battle, but being deserted by his men, <lb/>
            who went over to the enemy, he lost both the throne of <lb/>
            Macedonia and his army. His son Demetrius, however, <lb/>
            though but a boy, collecting an army in the absence of his <lb/>
            father, not only recovered Macedonia, which had been lost, but <lb/>
            drove Alexander from the throne of Epirus. Such was the <lb/>
            fickleness of the soldiers, or the mutability of fortune, that <lb/>
            kings were seen one day in the character of sovereign,.;, and <lb/>

          <p>III. Alexander, after fleeing, on his expulsion, to the <lb/>
            Acarnanians, was restored to his throne, with not less eager­ <lb/>
            ness on the part of the Epirots than exertion on the part of <lb/>
            his allies. About the same time died Magas,* king of Cyrene, <note type="footnote">* Wetzel has Agas in his text, but says in his note that "we should </note> <pb n="205"/>
            <note type="margin"> <unclear>B</unclear>.C. 245. </note> <lb/>
            who, before he fell sick, bad betrothed his only daughter <lb/>
            Berenice to his brother Ptolemy's son, in order to end all <lb/>
            disputes with him. But after the death of the king, Arsinoë, <lb/>
            the mother of the girl, resolving to break off a marriage which <lb/>
            had been contracted against her will, sent for Demetrius, the <lb/>
            brother of King Antigonus, from Macedonia, to marry the <lb/>
            damsel, and occupy the throne of Cyrene. Nor did Demetrius <lb/>
            delay to comply with her wishes. But having speedily arrived, <lb/>
            by the aid of a favourable wind, at Cyrene, he began, from the <lb/>
            very first, through presuming on his handsome person (with <lb/>
            which he had already made too much impression on his <lb/>
            mother-in-law*), to conduct himself haughtily and overbearingly <lb/>
            both to the royal family and the army. He also transferred <lb/>
            his desire to please from the daughter to the mother; a fact <lb/>
            which was first suspected by the damsel, and at last drew <lb/>
            odium upon him from the people and the army. The affec­ <lb/>
            tions of all, therefore, being set on the son of Ptolemy, a <lb/>
            conspiracy was formed against Demetrius, and assassins were <lb/>
            sent to kill him, when he was gone to bed with his mother- <lb/>
            in-law. Arsinoë, hearing the voice of her daughter, standing <lb/>
            at the door, and desiring them " to spare her mother," covered <lb/>
            her paramour a while with her own person. He was however <lb/>
            slain, and Berenice, by his death, both took revenge for the <lb/>
            licentiousness of her mother, without violation of her duty to <lb/>
            her, and, in choosing a husband, followed the judgment of her <lb/>
            father.</p>

            his own family, his mother Laodice. who ought to have re­ <lb/>
            strained him, encouraging him to it. He put to death his <lb/>
            step-mother Berenice, the sister of Ptolemy, king of Egypt, <lb/>
            together with his little brother, her son. By perpetrating <lb/>
            this cruelty, he both incurred the stain of infamy, and involved <lb/>
            himself in a war with Ptolemy. As for Berenice, when she <lb/>
            heard that assassins were sent to despatch her, she shut her­ <lb/>
            self up in Daphne ; and it being reported throughout the <lb/>
            cities of Asia, that she and her little son were besieged there, <lb/>
            they all, commiserating her undeserved misfortunes from <lb/>
            their recollection of the high character of her father and her <lb/>
            ancestors, sent her assistance. Her brother Ptolemy, too, <lb/>
            alarmed at the danger of his sister, left his kingdom, and <lb/>
            hastened to her support with all his forces. But Berenice, <lb/>
            before succour could arrive, was surprised by treachery, as she <lb/>
            could not be taken by force, and killed. The deed was re­ <lb/>
            garded by every one as an atrocity; and all the cities, in <lb/>
            consequence, which had revolted (after having equipped a vast <lb/>
            fleet), being suddenly alarmed at this instance of cruelty, and <lb/>
            wishing to take revenge for her whom they had meant to <lb/>
            defend, gave themselves up to Ptolemy, who, if he had not <lb/>
            been recalled to Egypt by disturbances at home, would have <lb/>
            made himself master of all Seleucus's dominions. Such <lb/>
            hatred did an unnatural crime bring upon Seleucus; or so <lb/>
            much good feeling did the death of a sister, dishonourably <lb/>
            killed, excite in behalf of Ptolemy!</p>
          <p>II. After the departure of Ptolemy, Seleucus, having pre­ <lb/>
            pared a great fleet against the cities that had revolted, lost it <lb/>
            in a storm that suddenly arose, as if the gods themselves had <lb/>
            taken vengeance on him for his murder; nor did fortune leave <lb/>
            him anything, of all his mighty armament, except his body <lb/>
            and life, and a few companions amid the wreck. It was <lb/>
            indeed a lamentable occurrence, and yet such as Seleucus <lb/>
            might have desired; for the cities, which from hatred to <lb/>
            him had gone over to Ptolemy, being moved, by a sudden <lb/>
            change in their feelings, to compassionate his loss at sea (as <lb/>
            if, in the judgment of the gods, satisfaction had been made <lb/>
            them), put themselves again under his government. Rejoiced <lb/>
            at his misfortune, therefore, and enriched by his loss, he made <lb/>
            war upon Ptolemy, as being now a match for him in strength; <lb/>
            but as though he had been born only for a sport to fortune, <pb n="207"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="B.C. 245—224.]"/> <lb/>
            and had received the power of a king only to lose it, he was <lb/>
            defeated in a battle, and fled in trepidation to Antioch, not <lb/>
            much better attended than after his shipwreck. From this <lb/>
            place he despatched a letter to his brother Antiochus, in <lb/>
            which he implored his aid, and offered him that part of Asia <lb/>
            within Mount Taurus, as a recompense for his services. But <lb/>
            Antiochus, though he was but fourteen years old, yet, being <lb/>
            greedy of dominion beyond his years, caught at the oppor­ <lb/>
            tunity, not with the kindly feeling with which it was offered, <lb/>
            but, like a robber, desiring to take the whole kingdom from <lb/>
            his brother, assumed, boy as he was, a manly and unprin­ <lb/>
            cipled audacity. Hence he was called Hierax,* because, in <lb/>
            taking away the possessions of others, he conducted himself, <lb/>
            not like a man, but like a bird of prey</p>
          <p>Ptolemy Euergetes, in the meantime, learning that An­ <lb/>
            tiochus was coming to the aid of Seleucus, and not wishing to <lb/>
            have to contend with two enemies at once, made peace with <lb/>
            Seleucus for ten years. But the peace that was granted <lb/>
            Seleucus by his enemy, was broken by his own brother, who, <lb/>
            having hired an army of Gauls, brought hostilities instead of <lb/>
            succour, and showed himself, though he had been implored for <lb/>
            aid, an enemy instead of a brother. In the battle that followed <lb/>
            Antiochus was victor, indeed, through the prowess of the <lb/>
            Gauls ; but they, thinking that Seleucus had fallen on the field, <lb/>
            began to turn their arms against Antiochus himself, in the <lb/>
            hope of ravaging Asia with greater freedom, if they destroyed <lb/>
            the whole royal family. Antiochus, seeing their design, pur­ <lb/>
            chased peace from them, as from robbers, with a sum of <lb/>
            money, and formed an alliance with his own mercenaries.</p>
          <p>III. Meanwhile Eumenes, king of Bithynia, when the <lb/>
            brothers were divided and exhausted by civil war, attacked <lb/>
            both the victorious Antiochus and the Gauls, as if he intended <lb/>
            to take possession of Asia while it was left without a master. <lb/>
            Nor did he find any difficulty in overthrowing them, as they <lb/>
            were weakened by their previous conflicts, and he himself was <lb/>
            fresh and vigorous. At that period, indeed, every war was <lb/>
            intended for the reduction of Asia; whoever was stronger than <lb/>
            his neighbours was ready to seize on Asia for his prey. The <lb/>
            brothers, Seleucus and Antiochus, went to war for the sove­ <lb/>
            reignty of Asia; Ptolemy, king of Egypt, under pretext of <note type="footnote"> * ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ιἑραξ</foreign>, a hawk or falcon. </note> <pb n="208"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.XXVII. CH.III. </note> <lb/>
            avenging his sister, was eager to secure Asia. On the one <lb/>
            side Eumenes of Bithynia, on the other the Gauls (an army <lb/>
            of mercenaries always ready to support the weaker), laid waste <lb/>
            Asia, while no one, among so many robbers, was found to be <lb/>
            its protector.</p>
          <p>When Antiochus was overthrown, and Eumenes had pos­ <lb/>
            sessed himself of the greater part of the country, the two <lb/>
            brothers, though the prize for which they had fought was lost, <lb/>
            could not even then come to an agreement, but, leaving their <lb/>
            foreign enemies unmolested, continued the war for the destruc­ <lb/>
            tion of each other. Antiochus, being again defeated, and <lb/>
            exhausted with a flight of many days' continuance, arrived at <lb/>
            last at the palace of Artamenes, his father-in-law, king of <lb/>
            Cappadocia. Being kindly received by him at first, but <lb/>
            learning, after some days, that treacherous designs were form­ <lb/>
            ing against him, he sought safety by again taking to flight. <lb/>
            When he was thus a fugitive, and found nowhere a place of <lb/>
            security, he betook himself to his enemy Ptolemy, whose faith <lb/>
            he thought more to be trusted than that of his brother, <lb/>
            whether he reflected on what he would have done to his <lb/>
            brother, or what he had deserved from him. But Ptolemy, <lb/>
            not more friendly to him when he came to surrender, that <lb/>
            when he had been an open foe, ordered that he should be kept <lb/>
            in the closest confinement. From hence however he escaped, <lb/>
            eluding his keepers by the aid of a courtesan, with whom he <lb/>
            had been familiar, and was slain in his flight by some robbers. <lb/>
            Seleucus too, about the same time, lost his kingdom, and was <lb/>
            killed by a fall from his horse. Thus these two brothers, as <lb/>
            if brothers also in fate, both became exiles; and both, after <lb/>
            losing their dominions, died a death merited by their crimes. <pb n="209"/>

          <p>I. WHEN Olympias, daughter of Pyrrhus king of Epiras, had <lb/>
            lost her husband Alexander, who was also her brother,. she <lb/>
            took upon herself the guardianship of her sons Pyrrhus and <lb/>
            Ptolemy, whom she had by him, and the administration of the <lb/>
            kingdom; and finding that the Ætolians wanted to take from <lb/>
            her a part of Acarnania, which the father of the boys had <lb/>
            received as a recompense for assisting them in war,t she ad­ <lb/>
            dressed herself to Demetrius king of Macedonia, and gave him <lb/>
            her daughter Phthia in marriage (though he was already <lb/>
            united to a sister of Antiocbus king of Syria), that she might <lb/>
            secure by right of relationship the assistance which she could <lb/>
            not obtain from his compassion. A marriage was accordingly <lb/>
            solemnized, by which Demetrius gained the love of a new <lb/>
            wife, and the hatred of his former one; who, as if divorced, <lb/>
            went off to her brother Antiochus, and excited him to make <lb/>
            war upon her husband.</p>
          <p>The Acarnanians also, fearing to trust for support to the <lb/>
            Epirots, requested of the Romans assistance against the <lb/>
            Ætolians, and prevailed on the senate to send ambassadors to <lb/>
            order the Ætolians “to withdraw their garrisons from the <lb/>
            cities of carnania, and allow those to be free, who alone, of <lb/>
            all the people of Greece, had not contributed aid to the <lb/>
            Greeks against the Trojans, the authors of the Roman race."</p>
          <p>II. But the Ætolians listened to the embassy of the Ro­ <lb/>
            mans with haughtiness, upbraiding them with their fortune <lb/>
            against the Carthaginians and Gauls, by whom they had been <lb/>
            fearfully slaughtered in so many wars, and saying that “ their <lb/>

            be opened to meet the Carthaginians, before their arms were <lb/>
            brought into Greece." They then desired them to remember <lb/>
            “ who they were that threatened, and whom they threatened. <lb/>
            That the Romans had not been able to defend their city <lb/>
            against the Gauls; and, when it was taken, had recovered it,* <lb/>
            not by the sword, but with gold; but that when that people <lb/>
            entered Greece, in considerably greater numbers, they them­ <lb/>
            selves had utterly destroyed them, not only without the assist­ <lb/>
            ance of any foreign power, but without even calling into action <lb/>
            the whole of their own force, and had made that a place for their <lb/>
            graves which they had intended for the seat of their cities and <lb/>
            empire; while Italy, on the other hand, when the Romans <lb/>
            were still trembling at the recent burning of their city, was <lb/>
            almost entirely occupied by the Gauls. That they should <lb/>
            therefore have expelled the Gauls from Italy before they <lb/>
            threatened the Ætolians, and have defended their own pos­ <lb/>
            sessions before they sought those of others. And what sort of <lb/>
            men were the Romans ? mere shepherds, who occupied a ter­ <lb/>
            ritory wrested from its lawful owners by robbery; who, when <lb/>
            they were unable to procure wives, from the baseness of <lb/>
            their origin, seized them by open force; who, moreover, had <lb/>
            founded their very city in fratricide, and sprinkled the foun­ <lb/>
            dation of their walls with the blood of their king's brothel <lb/>
            But that the Ætolians had always been the chief people of <lb/>
            Greece, and, as they surpassed others in dignity, excelled <lb/>
            them also in bravery; that they were the only nation who had <lb/>
            always despised the Macedonians, even when flourishing in <lb/>
            possession of the empire of the world; who had felt no dread <lb/>
            of king Philip, and who had spurned the edicts of Alexander <lb/>
            the Great, after he had conquered the Persians and Indians, <lb/>
            and when all trembled at his name. That they therefore ad­ <lb/>
            vised the Romans to be content with their present fortune, <lb/>
            and not provoke the arms by which they knew that the Gauls <lb/>

          <p>III. Olympias* had now given up her dominions to her <lb/>
            sons, and Ptolemy had succeeded in the room of his deceased <lb/>
            brother Pyrrhus. Ptolemy, as he was marching to meet the <lb/>
            enemy with his army in array, was seized with a fit of sickness, <lb/>
            and died on his route. Olympias too, afflicted with her <lb/>
            double bereavement in the death of her sons, and dragging on <lb/>
            a suffering existence, did not long survive her offspring. The <lb/>
            young princess Nereis, and her sister Laodamia, being then <lb/>
            the only survivors of the royal family, Nereis married Gelo, <lb/>
            the son of the king of Sicily ; † and Laodamia, fleeing for refuge <lb/>
            to the altar of Diana, was killed in a tumult ‡of the populace; <unclear/> <lb/>
            2 crime which the immortal gods punished by a series of <lb/>
            disasters, and almost the total destruction of the people; for <lb/>
            after suffering from barrenness and famine, and being harassed <lb/>
            by civil discord, they were at length nearly cut off by <lb/>
            foreign wars; and Milo, the assassin of Laodamia, becoming <lb/>
            mad, and lacerating his flesh, § sometimes with the sword, some­ <lb/>
            times with stones, and at last with his teeth, died the twelfth <lb/>

            king. But some time after, being besieged in the palace by <lb/>
            an alarming insurrection of the Macedonians, he walked forth <lb/>
            publicly unattended by his guards, and throwing his diadem <lb/>
            and purple robe among the mob, bade them “ give those to <lb/>

            authority enviable,* not for its pleasures, but for its toils and <lb/>
            dangers." He then mentioned his own services ; " how he <lb/>
            had punished the defection of their allies; how he had put <lb/>
            down the Dardanians and Thessalians, when they were in <lb/>
            exultation at the death of king Demetrius ; how he had not only <lb/>
            maintained the honour of the Macedonians, but added to it. <lb/>
            Yet, if they were displeased at such services, he was ready to <lb/>
            resign the government, and to return what they had conferred <lb/>
            upon him; and they themselves might look out for a prince <lb/>
            whom they could govern.” The people, overcome with shame, <lb/>
            bade him resume the regal authority; but he refused to do <lb/>
            so till the leaders of the insurrection were delivered up to <lb/>
            punishment.</p>
          <p>IV. After this occurrence he made war upon the Spartans, <lb/>
            who were the only people that, during the wars of Philip and <lb/>
            Alexander, had set at nought the power of the Macedonians, <lb/>
            and those arms which were dreaded by every other nation. <lb/>
            Between these two most remarkable peoples war was prose­ <lb/>
            cuted with the greatest vigour on both sides, the one fighting <lb/>
            to support the old glory of the Macedonians, and the other, <lb/>
            not only to secure their hitherto unviolated liberty, but even <lb/>
            their lives. The Lacedæmonians being worsted, not only the <lb/>
            men, but their wives and children, endured their adverse <lb/>
            fortune with magnanimity. As no man had shrunk from <lb/>
            exposing his life in the field, so no woman wept for her lost <lb/>
            husband ; the old men extolled the honourable deaths of their <lb/>
            sons, and the sons rejoiced over their fathers that were slain <lb/>
            in battle; and all who survived lamented their lot, in not <lb/>
            having died for the liberty of their country. All received the <lb/>
            wounded with open doors, dressed their wounds, and recruited <lb/>
            them in their exhaustion. In this condition of affairs, there <lb/>
            was no noise or hurry in the city, and every one lamented the <lb/>
            public suffering more than his own private troubles. In <lb/>
            the course of these proceedings, king Cleomenes returned, <lb/>
            with his whole body wet, after the great slaughter that he <lb/>
            had made among the enemy, with his own blood and that of <lb/>
            his adversaries, and, entering the city, did not rest himself on <note type="footnote"> read qui aut imperare illis, aut aut parere ipsi sciant "sciat" being <lb/>

            from the weight of his armour, but leaning against a wall, and <lb/>
            finding that only four thousand men survived the battle, <lb/>
            exhorted them “to reserve themselves for the better times <lb/>
            that would come to their country." He then set out with his <lb/>
            wife and children to Egypt to Ptolemy, by whom he was <lb/>
            honourably received, and lived a long time in the highest <lb/>
            esteem with that monarch. After the decease of Ptolemy, he <lb/>
            was put to death, with all his family, by Ptolemy's son</p>
          <p>Antigonus, when the Spartans were thus reduced, pitying <lb/>
            the distress of so famous a city, prohibited his soldiers from <lb/>
            plundering it, and granted pardon to all who survived, observ­ <lb/>
            ing that “he had engaged in war, not with the Spartans, but <lb/>
            with Cleomenes, with whose flight all his resentment was <lb/>
            terminated ; nor would it be less glory to him, if Sparta <lb/>
            should be recorded to have been saved by him by whom alone <lb/>
            it had been taken; and that he accordingly spared the ground <lb/>
            and buildings of the city, scarcely any inhabitants being left <lb/>
            for him to spare." Not long afterwards Antigonus died, and <lb/>
            left the throne to his ward Philip, who was then fourteen <lb/>
            years old</p>

            un. erwent alterations, in consequence of a succession of new <lb/>

            his guardian, who was also his father-in-law, assumed the <lb/>
            government at the age of fourteen. In Asia, after Seleucus <lb/>
            was killed,* Antiochus, though still in his minority, was made <lb/>
            king. In Cappadocia, the father of Ariarathes, yet a boy, had <lb/>
            resigned the sovereignty to him. Of Egypt Ptolemy had <lb/>
            made himself master, after putting to death his father and <note type="footnote"> * Inferfecto Seleuco.] Bee the end of book xxviii. This was Seleucus <lb/>

            mother; from which crime he had afterwards the surname of <lb/>
            Philopator.* As for the Spartans, they had elected Lycurgus <lb/>
            in the room of Cleomenes. And that no changes might be <lb/>
            wanting at that period, Hannibal, at a very early age, was ap­ <lb/>
            pointed general of the Carthaginians, not for want of older <lb/>
            men, but because of his hatred to the Romans, with which <lb/>
            they knew that he had been imbued from his boyhood; the <lb/>
            mischief that he did, however, was not so pernicious to the <lb/>
            Romans as to Africa itself. In these youthful rulers, although <lb/>
            they had nc directors of maturer years, yet, as each was <lb/>
            anxious to tread in the steps of his predecessors, great talent <lb/>
            and ability appeared. Ptolemy was the only exception, who. <lb/>
            reckless as he had been in the attainment of power, was <lb/>
            equally remiss in the administration of it. As to Philip, the <lb/>
            Dardanians, and all the neighbouring people, who cherished, <lb/>
            as it were, an immortal hatred to the kings of the Mace­ <lb/>
            donians, were perpetually molesting him in contempt of his <lb/>
            youth. He, on the other hand, after repulsing his enemies. <lb/>
            was not content with having defended his own dominions, but <lb/>
            manifested the greatest eagerness to make war upon the <lb/>
            Ætolians.</p>
          <p>II. While he was meditating this enterprise, Demetrius <lb/>
            king of the Illyrians, who had lately been conquered by <lb/>
            .Emilius Paulus, the Roman consul, applied to him with <lb/>
            earnest entreaties for aid, and complaints of the injustice of <lb/>
            the Romans, " who," he said, " not content within the limits <lb/>
            of Italy, but grasping, with presumptuous hopes, at the empire <lb/>
            of the whole world, made war upon all kings. Thus, aspiring <lb/>
            to the dominion of Sicily, Sardinia, and Spain, and finally to <lb/>
            that of all Africa, they had engaged in a war with the Cartha­ <lb/>
            ginians and Hannibal; and that hostilities had been directed <lb/>
            against himself too, for no other reason than that he appeared to <lb/>
            lie near Italy, as if it were unlawful for any king to be on the <lb/>
            borders of their empire. And that Philip also himself must <lb/>
            take warning by his case, since the nearer t and more valuable <lb/>
            his kingdom, the more determined enemies would he find the <lb/>
            Romans to be." In addition, he said, that " he would give up <lb/>
            his kingdom, which the Romans had seized, to Philip himself <note type="footnote"> * Father-loving, ironically. </note><note type="footnote"> t Wetzel has prompting in his text, with most other editors, but in <lb/>

            as he should be better pleased to see his ally, rather than his <lb/>
            enemies, in possession of his dominions " With such repre­ <lb/>
            sentations as these, he prevailed upon Philip to lay aside his <lb/>
            designs on the Ætolians, and to make war upon the Romans ; <lb/>
            Philip supposing that there would be the less difficulty in the <lb/>
            undertaking, as he had heard that they had already been <lb/>
            beaten by Hannibal at the lake Trasimenus. Not to be dis­ <lb/>
            traded, therefore, with more than one war at the same time, <lb/>
            lie concluded a peace with the Ætolians, not as if intending to <lb/>
            carry war elsewhere, but as if he wished to promote the tran­ <lb/>
            quillity of Greece, “which," he asserted, “had never been <lb/>
            in greater danger, as the new empires of the Carthaginians <lb/>
            and Romans were rising in the west, who forbore from <lb/>
            attacking Greece and Asia only till they should decide their <lb/>
            dispute for the sovereignty by the sword, when the superior <lb/>
            power of the two would immediately invade the east.</p>
          <p>III. " He contemplated therefore," he said, " that cloud of <lb/>
            cruel and sanguinary war which was rising in Italy; he <lb/>
            contemplated the storm roaring and thundering from the <lb/>
            west, which, to whatever parts of the world the tempest of <lb/>
            victory might carry it, would pollute everything with a vast <lb/>
            shower of blood. That Greece had frequently felt great <lb/>
            disturbances at one time from the wars of the Persians, <lb/>
            at another from those of the Gauls, at another from <lb/>
            those of the Macedonians, but that they would think all <lb/>
            those to have been but trifling, if the force, which was now <lb/>
            collecting in Italy, should once pour itself forth from that <lb/>
            country. He saw what cruel and bloody conflicts those two <lb/>
            powers were maintaining with each other, with all the strength <lb/>
            of their forces, and all the abilities of their generals; and that <lb/>
            such fury could not end with the destruction of one party only, <lb/>
            without ruin to the neighbouring people. That the cruel <lb/>
            resolutions of the conquerors, it was true, were less to be <lb/>
            dreaded by Macedonia than by Greece; for Macedonia was <lb/>
            both more remote, and better able to defend itself; but he <lb/>
            knew that those who contended with such spirit would not be <lb/>
            content with Greece as a limit to their conquests, and that he <lb/>
            himself should have to fear a conflict with the party that <lb/>
            should get the advantage." Concluding, on this pretext, the <lb/>
            war with the Ætolians, and thinking of nothing else but the <lb/>
            contest of the Carthaginians and Romans, he carefully weighed <pb n="216"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.XII. CH.IV. </note> <lb/>
            the strength of each. But neither did the Romans, with the <lb/>
            Carthaginians* and Hannibal on their necks, appear free from <lb/>
            apprehension of Macedonia; indeed, both the ancient valour <lb/>
            of the Macedonians, their glory in having conquered the east, <lb/>
            and the character of Philip, who was fired with the ambition <lb/>
            of rivalling Alexander, and whom they knew to be active and <lb/>
            eager for the field, gave them sufficient cause for alarm.</p>
          <p>IV. Philip, as soon as he heard that the Romans had been <lb/>
            defeated by the Carthaginians in a second battle, openly de­ <lb/>
            clared himself their enemy, and began to build ships for <lb/>
            transporting an army into Italy. He then sent a deputy to <lb/>
            Hannibal with a letter, with the view of forming an alliance <lb/>
            with him. This deputy was taken prisoner, and brought <lb/>
            before the senate, but released unharmed ; not from respect <lb/>
            to the king, but that one who appeared still undetermined <lb/>
            might not be rendered a decided enemy. But afterwards, <lb/>
            when news was brought to the Romans that Philip was <lb/>
            preparing to transport troops into Italy, they despatched <lb/>
            the prætor Lævinus, with a well appointed fleet, to hinder him <lb/>
            from crossing.</p>
          <p>Lævinus, sailing over to Greece, prevailed on the Ætolians, <lb/>
            by making them numerous promises, to take up arms against <lb/>
            Philip, who, on his side, solicited the Achæans to go to war <lb/>
            with the Romans. Meanwhile the Dardanians began to ra. <lb/>
            vage the country of Macedonia, and, carrying off twenty thou. <lb/>
            sand prisoners, recalled Philip from his war with the Romans <lb/>
            to defend his own territories. At the same time the prætor <lb/>
            Lævinus, having made an alliance with king Attalus, proceeded <lb/>
            to lay waste Greece; of which the several states, dismayed at <lb/>
            such calamities, importuned Philip with embassies for succour ; <lb/>
            while the princes of the Illyrians, sticking close to his side, <lb/>
            demanded, with constant solicitations, the performance of his <lb/>
            promises to them. In addition, the plundered Macedonians <lb/>
            called on him for vengeance. Beset by such and so many d iffi­ <lb/>
            calties, he was in doubt to what he should first turn his attend )n; <lb/>
            but he promised them all to send them assistance shortly ; not <lb/>
            that he was able to do what he promised, but in order to k eep <lb/>
            them, by feeding them with hopes, in the bond of alliance <note type="footnote"> * All the editions have Sed nee Romani, tametsi Poeni et Hannibal is <lb/>

            Dardanians, who, watching for his absence, were ready to fall <lb/>
            on Macedonia with a still heavier force. He made peace, too, <lb/>
            with the Romans, who were well content to put on war with <lb/>
            Macedonia for a time. He laid a plot, moreover, for the life <lb/>

            was soliciting some of his allies to join the Romans ; but <lb/>

          <p>I. WHILE Philip was intent on great exploits in Macedonia, <lb/>
            the conduct of Ptolemy in Egypt was of an opposite character; <lb/>
            for having got the throne by parricide, and added the murder <lb/>
            of his brother to that of both his parents, he resigned himself, <lb/>
            as if all had gone happily with him, to the attractions of <lb/>
            luxury; and the whole court bad followed the manners of their <lb/>
            king. Not only his personal friends, and chief officers, but <lb/>
            the whole of the army had laid aside militarY exercises, and <lb/>
            grown corrupt and enervated in idleness.</p>
          <p>Antiochus, king of Syria, when he heard of this state of <lb/>
            things, and while the old animosity between the two kingdoms <lb/>
            incited him, captured many cities belonging to Ptolemy by a <lb/>
            sudden attack, and carried his arms into Egypt itself. Pto­ <lb/>
            lemy was accordingly in consternation, and endeavoured to <lb/>
            retard Antiochus, by sending embassies, until he could get <lb/>
            troops in readiness. Having then hired a large army in <lb/>
            Greece, he fought a battle with good success, and would have <lb/>
            driven Antiochus from his throne, if he had supported his for­ <lb/>
            tune with suitable spirit. But, content with recovering the <lb/>
            cities that he had lost, and making peace, he eagerly seized <lb/>
            the opportunity of sinking again into sloth, and, returr ing to <pb n="218"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.XXX. CH.II </note> <lb/>
            his former licentious habits, he put to death his wife Eurydice, <lb/>
            who was also his sister, and gave himself up to the caresses of <lb/>
            a mistress named Agathoclia; and thus, forgetful of all the <lb/>
            greatness of his name and dignity, he passed his nights in <lb/>
            wantonness, and his days in the pleasures of the table. As <lb/>
            ministrations to his luxury, timbrels and tabors- were intro­ <lb/>
            duced ; and the king, no longer a mere spectator, but a leader <lb/>
            of the revels, produced music from stringed instruments him­ <lb/>
            self. Such were at first the secret and latent pests of a <lb/>
            tottering court.</p>
          <p>II. Licentiousness subsequently increasing, the audacity of <lb/>
            his mistress could no longer be confined within the walls of <lb/>
            the palace : for the daily debaucheries of the king, which he <lb/>
            shared with her brother Agathocles, a corrupt youth of cap­ <lb/>
            tivating beauty, rendered her still more shameless. To all <lb/>
            this was added, too, the influence of their mother CEnanthe, <lb/>
            who, by the charms of her two children, kept the monarch <lb/>
            quite enthralled. Not content with enslaving the king, they <lb/>
            made themselves rulers of the kingdom; they showed them­ <lb/>
            selves in public places, received salutations, and were followed <lb/>
            by a train of attendants. Agathocles, attaching himself closely <lb/>
            to the king's side, assumed the administration of the state; <lb/>
            women disposed of offices, governments, and commissions; <lb/>
            nor had any one less power in the kingdom than the king <lb/>
            himself. In the midst of this state of things the king died, <lb/>
            leaving a son, five years old, by his sister Eurydice; but his <lb/>
            death, while the women were seizing on the royal treasures, <lb/>
            and endeavouring, by forming a confederacy with some des­ <lb/>
            perate characters, to get the government into their own hands, <lb/>
            was for a long time kept secret. But the truth becoming <lb/>
            known, Agathocles was killed by a rising of the people, and <lb/>
            the women nailed on crosses to avenge the death of Eurydice.</p>
          <p>After the king's decease, and when the infamy of the king­ <lb/>
            dom was expiated, as it were, by the punishment of the cour­ <lb/>
            tezans, the people of Alexandria sent ambassadors to the <lb/>
            Romans, requesting them “to take on themselves the guard­ <lb/>

            which, they said, Philip and Antiochus had already portioned <lb/>
            out between them by a treaty made for the purpose."</p>
          <p>III. This embassy was acceptable to the Romans, who were <lb/>
            seeking a pretence for making war upon Philip, for having <lb/>
            formed designs against them in the time of the Punic war. <lb/>
            To this feeling was added the circumstance, that, since the <lb/>
            Carthaginians and Hannibal were conquered, there was no <lb/>
            one of whose arms they had a greater dread, considering what <lb/>
            a commotion Pyrrhus, with but a small force, had excited in <lb/>
            Italy, and what exploits the Macedonians had achieved in the <lb/>
            east. Ambassadors were accordingly despatched to warn <lb/>
            Philip and Antiochus " to- make no attempt upon Egypt." <lb/>
            Marcus Lepidus was also sent into Egypt, to govern the <lb/>
            orphan's kingdom in the character of guardian. During the <lb/>
            course of these proceedings, embassies from king AttaIns, and <lb/>
            from the Rhodians, arrived at Rome, to complain of injuries <lb/>
            that they had suffered from Philip. These representations <lb/>
            removed from the minds of the senate all hesitation about <lb/>
            going to war with Macedonia; and forthwith, under pretence <lb/>
            of taking the part of their allies, war was declared against <lb/>
            Philip, and some legions, with one of the consuls, were sent <lb/>
            off to Macedonia. Not long after, too, the whole of Greece, <lb/>
            stimulated by confidence in the Romans, and the hope of <lb/>
            recovering their ancient liberty, to rise against Philip, made <lb/>
            war upon him ; and thus, being assailed on every side, he was <lb/>
            compelled to beg for peace. But when the terms of it were <lb/>
            set forth by the Romans, both Attalus and the Rhodians, as <lb/>
            well as the Achæans and Ætolians, began to demand that the <lb/>
            places belonging to them should be restored. Philip, on the <lb/>
            other hand, allowed that 11 he might be induced to submit to <lb/>
            the Romans, but that it was intolerable that the Greeks, who <lb/>
            had been subdued by his ancestors Philip and Alexander, and <lb/>
            brought under the yoke of the Macedonian empire, should die <lb/>
            fate articles of peace to him, as if they were conquerors; and <lb/>
            that they ought to give an account of their conduct in their <lb/>
            state of slavery, before they sought to recover their liberty." <lb/>
            At last, on his request, a truce was allowed for two months, <lb/>
            that the peace, on which they could not come to terms in <lb/>
            Macedonia, might be obtained from the senate at Rome.</p>
          <p>IV. In the same year- a concussion of the earth happened <note type="footnote">* No for it was several years before that this commotion of the </note> <pb n="220"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.XXX. CH.III.</note> <lb/>
            between the islands Thema. and Therasia, in the midst of <lb/>
            the sea at an equal distance from either shore, where, to the <lb/>
            astonishment of those that were sailing past, an island rose <lb/>
            suddenly from the deep, the water being at the same time <lb/>
            hot. In Asia too, on the same day, the same earthquake <lb/>
            shattered Rhodes,† and many other cities, with a terrible <lb/>
            ruin; some it swallowed up entire As all men were alarmed <lb/>
            at this prodigy, the soothsayers predicted that “the rising <lb/>
            power of the Romans would swallow up the ancient empire of <lb/>
            the Greeks and Macedonians."</p>
          <p>In the meantime, Philip, as his terms of peace were rejected <lb/>
            by the senate, prevailed on the tyrant Nabist to join him in <lb/>
            prosecuting the war. Having then led out his army into the <lb/>
            field, he began to encourage his men, while the enemy stood <lb/>
            in array on the opposite side, by saying that “the Persians, <lb/>
            Bactrians, and Indians, and all Asia to the utmost boundaries <lb/>
            of the east, had been subdued by the Macedonians; and that <lb/>
            this war was more bravely to be maintained than those which <lb/>
            had preceded it, in proportion as liberty was more precious <lb/>
            than empire." Flamininus, too, the Roman consul, animated <lb/>
            his men to battle by representing what had lately been <lb/>
            achieved by the Romans, observing that “Carthage and Sicily <lb/>
            on one side, and Italy and Spain on the other, had been <lb/>
            thoroughly reduced by Roman valour; and that Hannibal, <note type="footnote"> earth took place, namely, in the first year of the 139th Olympiad, as is <lb/>
            apparent from Polybius, v. 88, and the Chronicon of Eusebius. But <lb/>
            Pliny, H. N. ii. 87, says that Automata or Hiera, the island here signi­ <lb/>
            fied, arose between Them and Therasia in the second year of the 156th <lb/>
            Olympiad ; how this can be correct, I do not understand.—Is. Vossius. <lb/>
            Vossius, however, is not quite right in his computation. Pliny says <lb/>
            that Them and Therasia sprung from the sea in the fourth year of the <lb/>
            135th Olympiad, and that Automata or Hiera arose one hundred and <lb/>
            thirty years afterwards; this would be in the third year of the 167th <lb/>
            Olympiad. Concerning the rise of this island from the deep, see <lb/>
            Strabo, i. 3; Sen. Nat. Quaest. vi. 21 ; ii. 26; it is also noticed by <lb/>
            Livy, xxxix. 56, and Amm. Marcell. xvii. 6. Other islands have since <lb/>

            by whose expulsion from Italy they had become masters of <lb/>
            Africa, a third part of the world, was not to be thought inferior <lb/>
            to Alexander the Great. Nor were the Macedonians to be <lb/>
            estimated by their ancient reputation, but by their present <lb/>
            power; for that the Romans were not waging war with <lb/>
            Alexander the Great, whom they had heard called invincible, <lb/>
            or with his army, which had conquered all the east, but with <lb/>
            Philip, a youth of immature years,* who could scarcely defend <lb/>
            the frontiers of his dominions against his neighbours, and with <lb/>
            those Macedonians who were not long ago a prey to the Dar­ <lb/>

            forefathers, but that he could relate those of his own soldiers; <lb/>
            since Hannibal and the Carthaginians, and almost all the <lb/>
            west, had not been conquered by any other army, but by <lb/>
            those very troops which he had with him in the field." The <lb/>
            soldiers on both sides, roused by these exhortations, rushed <lb/>
            to the encounter, the one army exulting in their conquest of <lb/>
            the east, the other in that of the west; the one carrying to <lb/>
            the battle the ancient and fading glory of their ancestors, <lb/>
            the other the flower of valour fresh from recent exertions. <lb/>
            But the fortune of Rome. was superior to that of the Mace­ <lb/>
            donians; and Philip, exhausted by his efforts in war, and <lb/>
            suing for peace from Flamininus, the consul, was allowed <lb/>
            to retain indeed the name of king; but, being deprived of all <lb/>
            the cities of Greece, as being parts of his dominion beyond <lb/>
            the bounds of its ancient territory, he preserved only Mace­ <lb/>
            donia. The Ætolians, however, were displeased, because <lb/>
            Macedonia was not taken from the king at their suggestion, <lb/>
            and given to themselves as a reward for their service in the <lb/>
            war, and sent ambassadors to Antiochus, to induce him, by <lb/>
            flattering his greatness, to engage in a war with the Romans, <lb/>

            youthful age of his son (who. left with the prospect of wield­ <lb/>
            ing the sceptre, was a prey even to his own domestics), being <lb/>
            held in contempt, Antiochus, king of Syria, resolved to get <lb/>
            possession of Egypt. As he attacked Phœnice, accordingly, <lb/>
            and several cities, which, though situate in Syria, belonged of <lb/>
            right to Egypt,. the senate despatched ambassadors to him, to <lb/>
            warn him “not to molest the dominions of an orphan, who <lb/>
            had been recommended to their protection by the last prayers <lb/>
            of his dying father." This embassy being disregarded, another <lb/>
            arrived some time after, which, saying nothing on behalf of <lb/>
            the orphan, ordered that a the cities, which had fallen to the <lb/>
            Roman people by the right of war, should be restored to their <lb/>
            former condition." On his refusal to comply with this man­ <lb/>
            date, war was declared against him, which he, after lightly <lb/>
            undertaking it, prosecuted with ill success.</p>
          <p>At the same time, the tyrant Nabis had taken possession of <lb/>
            several cities t of Greece. The senate, in consequence, that <lb/>
            the Roman forces might not be distracted by two wars at <lb/>
            once, sent orders to Flamininus. that “he should, if he thought <lb/>
            it expedient, deliver Greece from Nabis, as he had delivered <lb/>
            Macedonia from Philip.” ‡ To this end, his term of command <lb/>
            was prolonged. The name of Hannibal, indeed, rendered a <lb/>
            war with Antiochus an object of dread; for Hannibal's ene­ <lb/>
            mies, by secret communications to the Romans, accused him <note type="footnote"> * Phœnicen, cœterasque Syria quidem, &amp;c.] By Phoenice is meant the <lb/>

            of having entered into a league with Antiochus, saying that <lb/>
            he, who was accustomed to command, and to extravagant <lb/>
            military licentiousness, was unable to live patiently under the <lb/>
            control of laws; and that, from disgust at the quiet of the <lb/>
            city, he was always looking about for occasions for war." <lb/>
            These charges, though false, passed for true with such as were <lb/>
            timid.</p>
          <p>II. At length the senate, struck with alarm, sent Cnæus <lb/>
            Servilius, in the character of ambassador, into Africa, to watch <lb/>
            the proceedings of Hannibal, giving him secret instructions <lb/>
            " to compass his death, if he could, by the agency of his ene­ <lb/>
            mies, and deliver the Roman people from the terror of his <lb/>
            hated name." But this circumstance did not long escape the <lb/>
            knowledge of Hannibal, a man sagacious in foreseeing and <lb/>
            guarding against dangers, and not less thoughtful of adversity <lb/>
            in prosperity than of prosperity in adversity. Having shown <lb/>
            himself in public, therefore, during the whole day, in the <lb/>
            forum of Carthage, before the face of the chief personages and <lb/>
            the Roman ambassador, he mounted his horse, on the ap­ <lb/>
            proach of evening, and galloped off to a farm which he had in <lb/>
            the suburbs, near the sea-coast, his attendants, who knew <lb/>
            nothing of his intentions, being directed to wait for his return <lb/>
            at the gate of the city. He had vessels, with rowers, con­ <lb/>
            cealed in an unfrequented inlet on the coast; and he had also <lb/>
            a large sum of ready money at his farm, so that, when occasion <lb/>
            should require, neither difficulty * nor vant of resource <lb/>
            might retard his escape. Selecting the most vigorous of his <lb/>
            slaves, therefore, the number of whom a body of Italian <lb/>
            prisoners augmented, he went on board a ship, and directed <lb/>
            his course towards the dominions of Antiochus. The next <lb/>
            day the city looked for their chief, who was then consul,! in <lb/>
            the forum; and when intelligence was brought that he was <lb/>
            gone, they were all in as much trepidation as if the city had <lb/>
            been taken, and foreboded that his flight would prove fatal to <lb/>
            them; while the Roman ambassador, as if war was already <note type="footnote"> * All the texts have facultas. Grævius and Vorstius think that we <lb/>

            commenced on Italy by Hannibal, returned privately to <lb/>
            Rome, carrying the alarming news with him.</p>
          <p>III. In Greece, meanwhile, Flamininus, having formed an <lb/>
            alliance with several cities, defeated Nabis the tyrant in two <lb/>
            successive battles, and left him sadly humbled, with his re­ <lb/>
            sources apparently exhausted, in his own dominions. But <lb/>
            after liberty was restored to Greece, the garrisons withdrawn <lb/>
            from the cities, and the Romans returned to Italy, Nabis, <lb/>
            a.,; if tempted afresh by the deserted state of the country, <lb/>
            possessed himself of several cities by sudden attacks; when <lb/>
            the Achæans, alarmed at his proceedings, and fearing that the <lb/>
            evils in their neighbourhood might reach themselves, de­ <lb/>
            termined upon war against him, and appointed to the com­ <lb/>
            mand in it their strategus Philopœmen, a man of extraordinary <lb/>
            energy, and whose merit was so eminent in the contest, that <lb/>
            he was thought equal, in public opinion, to the Roman general <lb/>
            Flamininus.</p>
          <p>Hannibal, arriving about the same time at the court of <lb/>
            Antiochus, was received by him as a gift from the gods; and <lb/>
            such ardour, in consequence of his coming, was added to the <lb/>
            courage of the king, that he thought less of the mode of con­ <lb/>
            ducting the war, than of the prizes of victory. But Hannibal, <lb/>
            to whom the spirit of Rome was well known, said that the <lb/>
            Romans could not be subdued any where but in Italy. To <lb/>
            accomplish their overthrow, he asked for himself a hundred <lb/>
            ships, ten thousand foot, and a thousand cavalry, promising <lb/>
            that “with this force he would revive in Italy no less a war <lb/>
            than he had formerly carried on there, and would secure to <lb/>
            the king, remaining quiet in Asia, either a triumph over the <lb/>
            Romans, or equitable conditions of peace. To the Spaniards," <lb/>
            he added, “who were burning with ardour for war, nothing <lb/>
            was wanting but a leader ; that Italy was better known to him <lb/>
            now than in past times ; and that Carthage would not rest <lb/>
            in peace, but join him as an ally without delay."</p>
          <p>IV. As this counsel pleased the king, one of the attendants <lb/>
            of Hannibal was despatched to Carthage, to encourage the <lb/>
            Carthaginians, already forward enough of themselves, to take <lb/>
            up arms, acquainting them that “Hannibal would support <lb/>
            them with an army," and saying that “nothing was wanting, <lb/>
            on the side of the Carthaginians, but resolution, as Asia would <lb/>
            supply both troops and money for the enterprise." When <pb n="225"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="B.C. 197—191.]"/> <lb/>
            this announcement arrived at Carthage, the messenger was <lb/>
            seized by Hannibal's enemies, and being asked, when he <lb/>
            was brought before the senate, " to whom he was sent," he <lb/>
            replied, with Punic subtlety, that " he was sent to the whole <lb/>
            senate, as this was not the concern of a few individuals only, <lb/>
            but of the entire people." As they spent several days in <lb/>
            deliberating, whether they should send him to Rome to clear <lb/>
            them from guilt as a nation, he, in the meanwhile, went <lb/>
            secretly on board his vessel, and returned to Hannibal. As <lb/>
            soon as this was discovered, the Carthaginians sent intelligence <lb/>
            of the matter to Rome by an ambassador. The Romans also <lb/>
            sent ambassadors to Antiochus, who, under colour of delivering <lb/>
            a message, were to watch the preparations of the king, and <lb/>
            either to soften Hannibal's feelings towards the Romans, or, <lb/>
            by frequent association with him, to render him suspected and <lb/>
            unpopular with Antiochus. The ambassadors, accordingly, <lb/>
            meeting with Antiochus at Ephesus, made their communica­ <lb/>
            tion from the senate, and, while they waited for an answer, <lb/>
            were every day constantly visiting Hannibal, and observing <lb/>
            that, “he had withdrawn from his country under needless <lb/>
            apprehension, as the Romans would with the greatest honour <lb/>
            observe a peace which was made not so much with his govern­ <lb/>
            ment as with himself; and that they knew he had made war <lb/>
            upon the Romans, less from hatred to them, than from love <lb/>
            to his country (to which every honourable man owed life itself), <lb/>
            since the reasons for going to war were public ones between <lb/>
            the nations, and not private ones between the generals." <lb/>
            They then extolled his exploits; and he, pleased with their <lb/>
            conversation, talked frequently and readily with them, not <lb/>
            being aware that by his familiarity with the Romans, he was <lb/>
            incurring the dislike of the king; for Antiochus, supposing <lb/>
            that by such frequent intercourse a good understanding had <lb/>
            been effected between him and the Romans, communicated <lb/>
            nothing to him as he had been used to do, and began to detest <lb/>
            him, when he had excluded him from his councils, as an <lb/>
            enemy and a traitor to him. This distrust ruined the mighty <lb/>
            preparations for war, the skill of a leader being wanting to <lb/>
            conduct it. The communication from the senate was, that <lb/>
            " Antiochus should confine himself within the limits of Asia, <lb/>
            lest he should lay on them the necessity of invading that <note type="footnote"> Q </note> <pb n="226"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.XXXI. CH.V."/> <lb/>
            country." Slighting this message, be resolved not to wait for <lb/>
            war, but to commence it.</p>
          <p>V. It is said, that after the king had frequently held councils <lb/>
            concerning the war, from which Hannibal was excluded, he at <lb/>
            length desired that he should be called in, not that he might <lb/>
            act in any respect according to his advice, but that he might <lb/>
            not appear entirely to disregard him ; and that, when all the <lb/>
            rest had been asked their opinions, he in conclusion inquired <lb/>
            his. Hannibal, understanding what Antiochus's feelings <lb/>
            were, observed that “he was aware he was asked to attend, <lb/>
            not because the king wished for his advice, but to make <lb/>
            up the full number of votes ; yet, from his hatred towards <lb/>
            the Romans, and regard for the king, with whom alone a <lb/>
            secure retreat was left him in his exile, he would explain the <lb/>
            method in which the war should be conducted." Then, re­ <lb/>
            questing indulgence for the freedom with which he was going to <lb/>
            speak, he said, that “he approved none of the present sug. <lb/>
            gestions or proceedings ; nor did he like Greece as a seat of <lb/>
            the war, when Italy was a far more advantageous field for it; <lb/>
            for the Romans could not be conquered but by their own <lb/>
            arms, nor Italy subdued but by the resources of Italy; since <lb/>
            that people differed from others, and their mode of warfare <lb/>
            from that of other nations. In other wars, it was of the <lb/>
            greatest importance to have been the first to take advantage <lb/>
            of any ground or opportunity, to have ravaged the lands, or to <lb/>
            have captured towns, but that, with the Romans, whether you <lb/>
            took their cities, or defeated them, you would still have to <lb/>
            struggle with the enemy even when vanquished and fallen. <lb/>
            If any one should attack them in Italy, therefore, he might <lb/>
            conquer them with their own strength,* their own resources, <lb/>
            their own arms, as he himself had done ; but if any one left <lb/>
            Italy to them, which was the fountain-head, as it were, of <lb/>
            their power, he would act just as absurdly, as a man who <lb/>
            should attempt, not to exhaust rivers at their sources, but to <lb/>
            alter their channels or dry them up when great floods of water <lb/>
            had collected in them. He had entertained this," he said, <lb/>
            “as his private opinion, and had readily offered his advice <lb/>
            to that effect; and that he repeated it now, in the presence of <note type="footnote"> * Suis opibus.] That is, with the strength and resources of the <lb/>
            country. </note> <pb n="227"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="B.C. 197—191.]"/> <lb/>
            his friends, that they might all understand the way to go to <lb/>
            war with the Romans who, though invincible abroad, might <lb/>
            be reduced at home ; for they might be deprived of their city <lb/>
            sooner than of their empire, and of Italy sooner than of their <lb/>
            provinces; since they had lost their city to the Gauls, and <lb/>
            been almost crushed by him; nor was he ever defeated till he had <lb/>
            quitted their country, but that, when he returned to Carthage, <lb/>
            the fortune of the war was immediately changed with the seat <lb/>
            of it."</p>
          <p>VI. The king's courtiers were all opposed to this advice, <lb/>
            not regarding the advantages of the plan, but fearing that <lb/>
            Hannibal, if his counsel were approved, would gain the first <lb/>
            place in the king's favour. As for Antiochus, he did not so. <lb/>
            much dislike the scheme as the proposer of it, in the appre­ <lb/>
            hension that whatever glory resulted from its success would be <lb/>
            given to Hannibal, and not to himself. All proceedings were <lb/>
            therefore rendered ineffectual by the various flatteries of those <lb/>
            who sought to please the king ; nothing was conducted with <lb/>
            judgment or reason. Antiochus himself, resigning himself to <lb/>
            luxury during the winter, was every day engaged in celebrating <lb/>
            some new marriage.. Acilius the Roman consul, on the other <lb/>
            hand, who had been appointed to command in this war, pro­ <lb/>
            vided forces, arms, and every thing necessary for the contest, <lb/>
            with the utmost activity : he animated the confederate cities, <lb/>
            and drew to his interest such as were undecided. Nor was the <lb/>
            result of the conflict at variance with the preparations of each <lb/>
            party for it; for, in the first engagement, when the king RaW his <lb/>
            men giving ground, he did not support those who were in distress, <lb/>
            but put himself at the head of those that fled, and left his rich <lb/>
            camp a prey to the conquerors. But having reached Asia in his <lb/>
            flight, while the Romans were busied about the spoil, he began to <lb/>
            repent of having neglected Hannibal's counsel, and, taking that <lb/>
            general again into his friendship, conducted every thing accord­ <lb/>
            ing to his directions. In the mean time intelligence was brought <lb/>
            that Æmilius,† the Roman general, was approaching with <note type="footnote"> * Novis quotidie nuptiis deditus erat.] An exaggeration. He bad, <lb/>
            however, married his daughter Cleopatra to Ptolemy Epiphanes, Liv. <lb/>
            xxxv. 13; he gave another daughter to Ariarathes, king of Cappadocia, <lb/>
            and was going to give a third to Eumenes, king of Pergamus, but he <lb/>
            refused her. See Diod. Sic. xxix. 3.- Wetzel. </note><note type="footnote"> t Lucius Æmilius Regillus, prætor, B.O. 191 (Liv. xxxvii. 26, 30 </note> <note type="footnote"> Q 2 </note> <pb n="228"/>

            eighty ships of war, having been despatched by the senate to <lb/>
            carry on the war by sea. This news gave him hopes of re­ <lb/>
            trieving his fortune; and accordingly he resolved to fight <lb/>
            a battle by sea before any of the cities in alliance with him could <lb/>
            revolt to the enemy, hoping that the defeat which he had <lb/>
            suffered in Greece might be compensated by a new victory. <lb/>
            The fleet was therefore entrusted to Hannibal, and a battle was <lb/>
            fought; but neither were the Asiatic soldiers a match for the <lb/>
            Romans, nor their vessels equal to the beaked ships of the <lb/>
            enemy. The loss, however, was rendered less than it would <lb/>
            otherwise have been, by the able management of the general. <lb/>
            The report of the victory had not yet reached Rome,* and <lb/>
            therefore the city was in suspense about the consuls to be <lb/>
            chosen.</p>
          <p>VII. But to oppose Hannibal, what fitter leader could be <lb/>
            appointed than the brother of Africanus, since it was the busi­ <lb/>
            ness of the Scipios to conquer the Carthaginians? Lucius <lb/>
            Scipio was therefore made consul, and his brother Africanus <lb/>
            appointed to be his lieutenant-general, to let Antiochus see <lb/>
            that he had not more confidence in the conquered Hannibal <lb/>
            than the Romans in the victorious Scipio. As the Scipios <lb/>
            were transporting their army into Asia, news reached them that <lb/>
            the war, both by land and sea, was almost at an end ; as An <lb/>
            tiochus had been defeated in a battle by land, and Hannibal <lb/>
            in a battle by sea. As soon as they arrived, Antiochus sent <lb/>
            ambassadors to them, desiring peace, and having with them, <lb/>
            as an offering to Africanus individually, the son of that gene­ <lb/>
            ral, whom the king had captured as he was crossing in a small <lb/>
            boat. But Africanus replied, " that private favours were distinct <lb/>
            from public concerns; that the obligations of a father, and <lb/>
            the claims of one's country, were things entirely different; <lb/>
            claims which were to be preferred not only to children, but <lb/>
            even to life itself. That he, however, thankfully accepted the <lb/>
            kindness, and would make a return to the king's generosity at <note type="footnote"> xxxvi. 45); the battle was fought between Myconnesus and the <lb/>
            promontory of Corycus, and Æmilius triumphed for the victory in <lb/>
            the following year; but Antiochus appointed Polyxenides, not Hanni­ <lb/>
            bal, to command against him. See Liv. xxxvii. 26; Florus, ii 8.- <lb/>
            Wetzel. Livy mentions Polyxenides only; Florus both Polyxenides <lb/>
            and Hannibal. </note><note type="footnote"> * Justin seems here to have abridged his author too much. </note> <pb n="229"/>

            his own individual expense; but as to what related to war <lb/>
            and peace, nothing could be allowed to private favour, or cut <lb/>
            off from the interests of his country." He had never, indeed, <lb/>
            either treated about the ransom of his son, or allowed the <lb/>
            senate to treat about it, but, as became his dignity, said that <lb/>
            " he would recover his son by force of arms." The terms of <lb/>
            peace were then specified to the ambassadors : “that the king <lb/>
            should give up Asia to the Romans; that he should confine <lb/>
            hinself to his kingdom of Syria ; that he should give up all <lb/>
            his ships, with the prisoners and deserters, and repay the <lb/>
            Romans all the expenses of the war." These terms being re­ <lb/>
            peated to Antiochus, he said that “he was not yet so utterly <lb/>
            reduced, as that he should suffer himself to be despoiled of <lb/>
            his dominions ; and that such proposals were provocations to <lb/>
            war, not invitations to peace."</p>
          <p>VIII. Preparations for a contest were in consequence made <lb/>
            on both sides ; and when the Romans, having entered Asia, <lb/>
            had reached Troy, mutual gratulations took place between <lb/>
            the Trojans and the Romans; the Trojans observing that <lb/>
            “Æneas, and the other leaders that accompanied him, had gone <lb/>
            forth from them;" the Romans telling them that “they were <lb/>
            their children ;" and such joy was among them all as is wont to <lb/>
            be between parents and children met after a long separation. <lb/>
            The Trojans were delighted that their descendants, after <lb/>
            having conquered the west and Africa, were now laying claim <lb/>
            to Asia as their hereditary domain, remarking that “the ruin <lb/>
            of Troy had been an event to be desired, since it was so <lb/>
            happily to revive again." On the other hand, an insatiable <lb/>
            longing to gaze on their ancient home, the birth-place of their <lb/>
            ancestors, and the temples and images of the gods, had taken <lb/>
            possession of the Romans.</p>
          <p>As the Romans were coming from Troy, king Eumenes <lb/>
            met them with some auxiliary troops ; and soon after a battle <lb/>
            was fought with Antiochus; in which one of the Roman <lb/>
            legions, on the right wing, being beaten back, and fleeing to <lb/>
            their camp with more disgrace than danger, Marcus Æmilius, <lb/>
            a military tribune, who had been left to defend the camp, <lb/>
            ordered his men to arm themselves, and advance without the <lb/>
            rampart, and to threaten the fugitives with their swords drawn, <lb/>
            saving that “they should be put to death unless they returned <lb/>
            to the field, and should find their own camp more hostile to <pb n="230"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.XXXII. CH.I. </note> <lb/>
            them than that of the enemy." The legion, alarmed at such <lb/>
            peril on both sides, returned to the battle, their fellow soldiers, <lb/>
            who had stopped their flight, accompanying them, and, making <lb/>
            great havoc among the enemy, were the first cause of the <lb/>
            victory. Fifty thousand of the enemy were slain, and eleven <lb/>
            thousand taken prisoners. Antiochus suing for peace, nothing <lb/>
            was added to the former articles, Africanus observing that <lb/>
            " the spirit of the Romans was never broken if they were <lb/>
            defeated, and, if they were victorious, they were not rendered <lb/>
            tyrannical by success." The cities that were taken they <lb/>
            divided among their allies, deeming that glory was more desir­ <lb/>
            able for the Romans - than dominions merely for pleasure; and <lb/>
            that the honour of victory was worthy of being attached to the <lb/>
            Roman name, but that the luxuries of wealth might be left to <lb/>
            their adherents. /</p>

          <p>I. THE Ætolians, who had persuaded Antiochus to make <lb/>
            war on the Romans, were left, after he was defeated, to oppose <lb/>
            them by themselves, unequal in force, and unsupported by <lb/>
            assistance. Being soon after, in consequence, subdued, they <lb/>
            lost tfat liberty which they alone, among so many states of <lb/>
            Greece, had preserved inviolate against the power of the <lb/>
            Athenians and Spartans. This state of things was the more <lb/>
            grievous to them, as it was later in befalling them ; for they <lb/>
            reflected on those times in which they had withstood the <lb/>
            mighty power of the Persians by their own strength, and had <note type="footnote"> * Wetzel's text has Romani; but Romanis, the conjecture of Grævius, <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> B.C. 8<unclear/>.] </note> <lb/>
            humbled, in the Delphic war, the violent spirit of the Gauls <lb/>
            that was dreaded by Asia and Italy; and these glorious <lb/>
            recollections increased their grief at the loss of their liberty.</p>
          <p>During the course of these occurrences, a dispute at first, <lb/>
            and afterwards a war, arose between the Messenians and <lb/>
            Achæans, to determine which of the two should rule the other. <lb/>
            In this struggle Philopœmen, the famous general of the <lb/>
            Achæans, was taken prisoner, not from having been fearful of <lb/>
            exposing his life in the field, but from having fallen from his <lb/>
            horse in leaping a ditch, as be was rallying his mon for the <lb/>
            contest, and being overpowered by a host of enemies. The <lb/>
            Messenians, whether from fear of his valour, or respect for his <lb/>
            dignity, did not venture to kill him as he lay on the ground ; <lb/>
            but, as if they had ended the war by capturing him, they led <lb/>
            him prisoner through their whole city as in triumph, while the <lb/>
            people poured forth to meet him, as if it were their own <lb/>
            general, and not that of the enemy, that was coming; nor <lb/>
            would the Achæans have more eagerly beheld him victorious <lb/>
            than the enemy saw him under defeat. They ordered him <lb/>
            accordingly to be led into the theatre, that every one might <lb/>
            see him whose capture seemed incredible to every one. Being <lb/>
            then conducted to prison, they gave him, from respect for his <lb/>
            high character,* poison to drink, which he received with <lb/>
            pleasure, just as if he had been conqueror, first asking whether <lb/>
            Lycortas," a general of the Achæans, whom he knew to be <lb/>
            next to himself in the art of war, “ had got off safe ?" Hear­ <lb/>
            ing that he had escaped, he observed that " things were not <lb/>
            utterly desperate with the Achæans,” and expired. The war <lb/>

          <p>At Rome, as many cities of Greece had sent thither, to <lb/>
            complain of injuries received from Philip king of Macedonia, <lb/>
            and as a dispute arose in the senate-house between Deme <lb/>
            trius, Philips son, whom his father had sent to justify him to <lb/>
            the senate, and the deputies of the cities, the young prince, <lb/>
            confounded at the number of accusations brought forward, <lb/>
            suddenly became speechless; when the senate, moved at his <lb/>
            modesty, which had been admired by every one when he was <lb/>
            a hostage at Rome, suffered the controversy to terminate in <lb/>
            his favour. Thus Demetrius, by his modesty, obtained pardon <lb/>
            for his father, which was granted, not to the justice of his <lb/>
            defence, but from respect for his bashfulness; and this was <lb/>
            particularly signified in the decree of the senate, that it might <lb/>
            be known that it was not so much the king that was acquitted, <lb/>
            as the father that was excused for the sake of the son. The <lb/>
            circumstance, however, procured Demetrius no thanks for his <lb/>
            embassy at home, but rather odium and detraction ; for envy <lb/>
            drew upon him hatred from his brother Perseus, and with his <lb/>
            father, the cause of the indulgence shown him, as soon as he <lb/>
            knew it, become a source of dislike towards him, as he was <lb/>
            indignant that the character of his son should have had more <lb/>
            weight with the senate than his own authority as a father or <lb/>
            his dignity as a king. Perseus, in consequence, observing his <lb/>
            father's chagrin, laid before him, day after day, accusations <lb/>
            against Demetrius in his absence, and rendered him first an <lb/>
            object of hatred, and afterwards of suspicion, charging him at <lb/>
            one time with friendship for the Romans, and at another with <lb/>
            treachery to his father. At last he pretended that a plot was <lb/>
            laid for his own life by Demetrius, and, to prove the charge, <lb/>
            brought forward informers, suborned witnesses, and committed <lb/>
            the very crime t of which he accused his brother. Impelling <note type="footnote"> of gold, silver, and valuable offerings, as is said by Diod. Sic. xxix. <lb/>

          <p>III. After Demetrius was killed, and his rival removed, <lb/>
            Perseus grew not only more careless in his behaviour towards <lb/>
            his father, but even more insolent, conducting himself, not <lb/>
            as heir to the crown, but as king. Philip, offended at his <lb/>
            manner, became every day more concerned for the death of <lb/>
            Demetrius, and began at length to suspect that he had been <lb/>
            deceived by treachery, and put to the torture all the witnesses <lb/>
            and informers. Having, by this means, come to the know. <lb/>
            ledge of the deception, he was not less afflicted at the <lb/>
            dishonesty of Perseus than at the execution of the innocent <lb/>
            Demetrius, whom he would have avenged, had he not been <lb/>
            prevented by death; for shortly after he died of a disease <lb/>
            contracted by mental anxiety, leaving great preparations for <lb/>
            a war with the Romans, of which Perseus afterwards made <lb/>
            use. He had induced the Scordiscan Gauls to join him, and <lb/>
            would have had a desperate struggle with the Romans, had <lb/>
            not death carried him off.</p>
          <p>The Gauls, after their disastrous attack upon Delphi, in <lb/>
            which they had felt the power of the divinity more than that <lb/>
            of the enemy, and had lost their leader Brennus, had fled, <lb/>
            like exiles, partly into Asia, and partly into Thrace, and then <lb/>
            returned, by the same way by which they had come, into <lb/>
            their own country. Of these, a certain number settled at the <lb/>
            conflux of the Danube and Save, and took the name of <lb/>
            Scordisci. The Tectosagi, on returning to their old settlements <lb/>
            about Toulouse, were seized with a pestilential distemper, <lb/>
            and did not recover from it, until, being warned by the <lb/>
            admonitions of their soothsayers, they threw the gold and <lb/>
            silver, which they had got in war and sacrilege, into the lake <lb/>
            of Toulouse; all which treasure, a hundred and ten thousand <lb/>
            pounds of silver, and fifteen hundred thousand pounds of gold, <lb/>
            Cæpio, the Roman consul, a long time after, carried away with <lb/>
            him. But this sacrilegious act subsequently proved a cause <lb/>
            of ruin to Cæpio and his army. The rising of the Cimbrian <lb/>
            war, too, seemed to pursue the Romans as if to avenge the <lb/>
            removal of that devoted treasure. Of these Tectosagi, no <lb/>

            to Illyricum, and, after spoiling tne Istrians, settled in <lb/>
            Pannonia.</p>
          <p>The Istrians, it is reported, derive their origin from those <lb/>
            Colchians who were sent by king Æetes in pursuit of the <lb/>
            Argonauts, that had carried off his daughter;. who, after <lb/>
            they had sailed from the Pontus Euxinus into the Ister, and <lb/>
            had proceeded far up the channel of the river Save, pursuing <lb/>
            the track of the Argonauts, conveyed their vessels upon their <lb/>
            shoulders over the tops of the mountains, as far as the shores <lb/>
            of the Adriatic sea, knowing that the Argonauts must have <lb/>
            'one the same before them, because of the size of their ship.t <lb/>
            These Colchians, not overtaking the Argonauts, who had sailed <lb/>
            off, remained, whether from fear of their king or from <lb/>
            weariness of so long a voyage, near Aquileia, and were called <lb/>
            Istrians from the name of the river up which they sailed out <lb/>
            of the sea.</p>
          <p>The Dacians are descendants of the Getæ. This people <lb/>
            having fought unsuccessfully, under their king Oroles, against <lb/>
            the Bastarnæ, were compelled by his order, as a punishment <lb/>
            for their cowardice, to put their heads, when they were going <lb/>
            to sleep, in the place of their feet,‡ and to perform those <lb/>
            offices for their wives which used previously to be done for <lb/>
            themselves. Nor were these regulations altered, until they <lb/>
            had effaced, by new exertions in the field, the disgrace which <lb/>
            they had incurred in the previous war.</p>
          <p>IV. Perseus, having succeeded to the throne of his father <lb/>
            Philip, applied to all these nations to join him in a war against <lb/>
            the Romans. In the meanwhile a war broke out between king <lb/>

            Antiochus by the Romans, and Eumenes ; a war which <lb/>
            Prusias was the first to begin, having broken his treaty with <lb/>
            Emenes through confidence in Hannibal.</p>
          <p>Hannibal, when the Romans, among other articles of peace, <lb/>
            demanded from Antiochus that he should be surrendered to <lb/>
            them, received notice of this demand from the king, and, taking <lb/>
            to flight, went off to Crete. Here, when he had long led a <lb/>
            quiet life, but found himself envied for his great wealth, he <lb/>
            deposited some urns, filled with lead, in the temple of Diana, <lb/>
            as if thus to secure his treasure. The city,. in consequence, <lb/>
            being no longer concerned about him, as they supposed that <lb/>
            they had his wealth in pledge, he betook himself to Prusias, <lb/>
            putting his gold into some statues which he carried with him, <lb/>
            lest his riches, if seen, should endanger his life. Prusias being <lb/>
            subsequently defeated in a battle by land, and transferring the <lb/>
            war to the sea, Hannibal, by a new stratagem, was the cause <lb/>
            of procuring him a victory ; for he ordered serpents of every <lb/>
            kind to be enclosed in earthen pots, and to be thrown, in the <lb/>
            hottest of the engagement, into the enemy's ships. This <lb/>
            seemed at first ridiculous to the Pontic soldiers,† that the <lb/>
            enemy should fight with earthen pots, as if they could not <lb/>
            fight with the sword.‡ But when the ships began to be filled <lb/>
            with serpents, and they were thus involved in double peril, <lb/>
            they yielded the victory to the enemy.</p>
          <p>When the news of these transactions was brought to Rome, <lb/>
            ambassadors were despatched by the senate to require the two <lb/>
            kings to make peace, and demand the surrender of Hannibal. <lb/>
            But Hannibal, learning their object, took poison, and frustrated <lb/>
            their embassy by his death.</p>
          <p>This year was rendered remarkable by the deaths of the <lb/>
            three greatest generals then in the world, Hannibal, Philopce­ <lb/>
            men, and Scipio Africanus. Of these three it is certain that <lb/>

          <p>I. THE Romans carried on the Macedonian war with less <lb/>
            disturbance to their country than the Punic war, but with <lb/>
            more renown, as the Macedonians surpassed the Carthaginians <lb/>
            in honour, and were animated, moreover, by their glory in <lb/>
            having conquered the east, and supported also by the auxiliary <lb/>
            forces of all the neighbouring princes.† The Romans, accord­ <lb/>
            ingly, both raised a greater number of legions, and called for <lb/>
            assistance from Masinissa, king of Numidia, and all the rest of <lb/>
            their allies ; while notice was also given to Eumenes, king of <lb/>
            Bithynia, to aid them in the war with his whole force. Per­ <lb/>
            seus, besides his Macedonian army, which had had the repu­ <lb/>
            tation of being invincible, had supplies for a ten years' war, <lb/>
            collected by his father, in his treasures and magazines. Ele­ <lb/>
            vated by these resources, and forgetful of his father's fortune, <lb/>
            he bade his soldiers think of the past glory of Alexander.</p>
          <p>The first engagement was one of cavalry only; and Perseus, <lb/>
            being victorious in it, attracted the favourable regard of all who <lb/>
            had previously been in suspense. Yet he sent ambassadors <lb/>
            to the consul to ask for peace, which the Romans had granted <lb/>
            to his father even when conquered, offering to defray the <lb/>
            expenses of the war, as if he had been defeated. But the <note type="footnote"> * Sextario ] The sextarius was nearly a pint, being the sixth part of <lb/>

            consul Sulpicius offered him terms not less harsh than he <lb/>
            would have offered to a vanquished enemy. In the mean­ <lb/>
            time, the Romans, under the dread of so formidable a war, <lb/>
            created AEmilius Paul us consul, and conferred upon him, out <lb/>
            of due course,. the command in the Macedonian war.</p>
          <p>AEmilius, when he had reached the camp, lost no time in <lb/>
            coming to a battle. The night before it was fought, the <lb/>
            moon was eclipsed; a phenomenon which all interpreted un­ <lb/>
            favourably for Perseus, and presaged that the downfal of <lb/>
            the Macedonian empire was portended.</p>
          <p>II. In this engagement, Marcus Cato, the son of Cato the <lb/>
            orator, while he was fighting, with extraordinary bravery, among <lb/>
            the thickest of the enemy, fell from his horse, and continued <lb/>
            his efforts on foot. A number of the enemy gathered about <lb/>
            him when he fell, with loud shouts, as if they would kill him as <lb/>
            he lay on the ground, but he, recovering himself sooner than <lb/>
            they expected, made great slaughter among them. The enemy <lb/>
            flocking round him, however, to overpower him with their <lb/>
            numbers, his sword, as he was aiming at a tall fellow among <lb/>
            them, fell from his hand among a troop of his opponents; <lb/>
            when he, to recover it, plunged in among the points of the <lb/>
            enemy's weapons, protecting himself with his shield, while <lb/>
            both armies were looking on, and, having regained his sword, <lb/>
            though not without receiving many wounds, he got back safe <lb/>
            to his friends, amidst a loud shout from the enemy. t The rest <lb/>
            of the Romans, imitating his boldness, secured the victory. <lb/>
            King Perseus fled, and arrived, with ten thousand talents, at <lb/>
            Samothrace; and Cnæus Octavius, being sent by the consul <lb/>
            in pursuit of him, took him prisoner, with his two sons Alex­ <lb/>

          <p>I. THE Carthaginians and Macedonians being subdued, and <lb/>
            the power of the Ætolians weakened by the captivity of their <lb/>
            leading men, the Achaeans were the only people of all Greece <lb/>
            who seemed to the Romans, at that time, to be too powerful; <lb/>
            not, indeed, from any extraordinary strength existing in any <lb/>
            individual city, but because of a confederacy maintained among <lb/>
            all the cities. For the Achæans, though distributed through <lb/>
            several towns, like so many different members, yet formed but <lb/>
            one body and had but one government, and warded off danger <lb/>
            from any single city by the united strength of all. To the <lb/>
            Romans, therefore, as they were seeking a pretext for war, <lb/>
            fortune opportunely presented the complaints of the Spartans, <lb/>
            whose lands the Achæans, in consequence of hatred subsisting <note type="footnote"> donia attained its height when Alexander conquered Darius, B.C. 329, <lb/>
            in which year Justin, x. 3, considers that the Persian empire termi­ <lb/>
            nated, and the Macedonian began. Between that year and the defeat <lb/>
            of Perseus elapsed only 160 years, and if we would wish to make up <lb/>
            our authors number of 192, we must take in thirty-two from the <lb/>
            previous period, going back to B.C. 361, when Philip was a hostage at <lb/>
            Thebes. Hence the reading of Bongarsius's codices, 152, seems prefer­ <lb/>
            able ; or, to take a round number, 150, the reading of three other <lb/>
            copies; and this is the number given by Livy, xlv. 9.- Wetzel. </note> <pb n="239"/>
            <note type="margin"> B.C. 146.] </note> <lb/>
            between the two people, had laid waste. Answer was accord <lb/>
            ingly made by the senate to the Spartans, that “ they would <lb/>
            send commissioners into Greece, to examine into the affairs <lb/>
            of their allies, and to prevent further injury;" but secret <lb/>
            directions were at the same time given the commissioners, <lb/>
            that " they should dissolve the confederacy among the Achæans, <lb/>
            and make each city independent of the rest, that they might <lb/>
            thus the more easily be reduced to obedience, while, if any <lb/>
            cities were obstinate, they might be humbled by force." The <lb/>
            commissioners, in consequence, having summoned the chief <lb/>
            men of the cities to meet them at Corinth, read to them the <lb/>
            decree of the senate, and signified what their intentions were ; <lb/>
            declaring it “ expedient for all, that each city should have <lb/>
            its own independent laws and government." When this <lb/>
            communication was known throughout the city, the people <lb/>
            being thrown as it were into a fury, massacred all the <lb/>
            foreigners that were there, and would have laid violent hands <lb/>
            on the Roman commissioners themselves, had they not fled <lb/>
            away in haste as soon as they found a disturbance rising.</p>
          <p>II. When the news of these occurrences reached Rome, the <lb/>
            senate at once decreed war against the Achæans, giving the <lb/>
            conduct of it to the consul Mummius, who, conveying over <lb/>
            his army with the utmost expedition, and actively providing <lb/>
            himself with all necessaries, proceeded to offer the enemy <lb/>
            battle. As for the Achæans, as if they had undertaken a <lb/>
            matter of no difficulty in going to war with the Romans, every <lb/>
            thing was neglected and out of order amongst them. Thinking <lb/>
            of plunder, too, and not of fighting, they brought vehicles to <lb/>
            carry away the spoils of the enemy, and stationed their wives and <lb/>
            children on the hills to view the engagement. But when the <lb/>
            battle commenced, they were cut to pieces before the eyes of <lb/>
            their kindred, and afforded them only a dismal spectacle and <lb/>
            sad remembrances of grief. Their wives and children, also, <lb/>
            were changed from spectators into prisoners, and became the <lb/>
            prey of the enemy. The city of Corinth itself was razed to <lb/>
            the ground, and the inhabitants sold for slaves, that, by such <lb/>
            an example, a dread of insurrection might be thrown on other <lb/>
            cities.</p>
          <p>During these transactions, Antiochus, king of Syria, made <note type="footnote"> . war upon Ptolemy* king of Egypt, his elder sister's son, a </note> <note type="footnote"> • Ptolemy Philometor, who reigned from B.C. 180 to 145 (see Diod. </note> <pb n="240"/>

            prince naturally inactive, and so weakened by daily luxurious <lb/>
            indulgence, that he not only neglected the duties of his royal <lb/>
            station, but even, through excessive gluttony, had lost all <lb/>
            human feeling. Being expelled from his throne, he fled to <lb/>
            Alexandria to his younger brother Ptolemy,* and, having <lb/>
            shared the kingdom with him, they jointly sent ambassadors <lb/>
            to the Roman senate, imploring assistance, and the protection <lb/>
            of their alliance; and their solicitations prevailed with the <lb/>
            senate.</p>
          <p>III. Accordingly Popilius was despatched, in the character <lb/>
            of ambassador, to Antiochus, to desire him “ to refrain from <lb/>
            invading Egypt, or, if he had already entered it, to quit it <lb/>
            without delay." Having found him in Egypt, and the king <lb/>
            having offered to kiss him (for Antiochus, when he was a <lb/>
            hostaget at Rome, had been friendly with Popilius among <lb/>
            others), Popilius said that " private friendship must be set <lb/>
            aside, when the commands of his country stood in the way," <lb/>
            and having produced and delivered to him the decree of the <lb/>
            senate, but observing that he hesitated, and referred the <lb/>
            consideration of it to his friends, he drew a circle round him <lb/>
            with a staff which he carried in his hand, so large that it also <lb/>
            enclosed his friends, and desired him “ to decide on the spot, <lb/>
            and not to go out of that ring, till he had given an answer to <lb/>
            the senate whether he would have peace or war with Rome." <lb/>
            This firmness so daunted the king's spirit, that he replied that <lb/>
            " he would obey the senate."</p>
          <p>Antiochus, on returning to his kingdom, died, leaving a son <lb/>
            quite a boy. Guardians being assigned him by the people, <lb/>
            his uncle t Demetrius, who was a hostage at Rome, and who <lb/>
            had heard of the death of his brother, went to the senate, and <lb/>
            said that , he had come to Rome as a hostage while his <lb/>
            brother was alive, but that now he was dead, he did not know <note type="footnote"> Sic. xxx. 15), being the son and successor of Ptolemy Epiphanes, who <lb/>

            .for whom he was a hostage. It was therefore reasonable <lb/>
            he added, “ that he should be released to claim the throne, <lb/>
            which, as he had conceded it to his elder brother by the law <lb/>
            of nations, now of right belonged to himself, as he was su­ <lb/>
            perior to the orphan in age." But finding that he was not <lb/>
            released by the senate (their private opinion being that the <lb/>
            throne would be better in the hands of the young prince than <lb/>
            in his), he left the city on pretence of going to hunt, and <lb/>
            secretly took ship at Ostia,* with such as attended him in his <lb/>
            flight. On arriving in Syria, he was favourably received by <lb/>
            the whole people, and the orphan being put to death, the <lb/>
            throne was resigned to him by the guardians.</p>
          <p>IV. About the same time, Prusias, king of Bithynia, con­ <lb/>
            ceived a resolution to kill his son Nicomedes, with a desire to <lb/>
            benefit his younger children by a second marriage, whom he <lb/>
            had sent to Rome. But the design was betrayed to the young <lb/>
            prince by those who had undertaken the execution of it, and <lb/>
            who exhorted him, since he had become an object of his <lb/>
            father's cruelty, to anticipate his schemes, and turn the villainy <lb/>
            on the head of its contriver." Nor was it difficult to prevail <lb/>
            upon him ; and when, being sent for, he had come t into his <lb/>
            fathers dominions, he was immediately selected as king <lb/>
            Prusias, deprived of his throne by his son, and reduced to a <lb/>
            private station, was forsaken even by his slaves. While he <lb/>
            lived in retirement, he was killed by his son, with no less <lb/>
            guilt than that with which he himself had ordered his son to <lb/>
            be put to death</p>

          <p>I. DEMETRIUS, h ving possessed himself of the throne of <lb/>
            Syria, and thinking that peace might be dangerous in the <lb/>
            unsettled state of his affairs, resolved to enlarge the bordero <note type="footnote"> * Ostia or Hostia at the mouth of the Tiber. </note><note type="footnote"> t From the expression "he had come," venerat, it appears that <lb/>

            of his kingdom, and increase his power, by making war upon <lb/>
            his neighbours. Accordingly, being incensed with Ariarathes, <lb/>
            king of Cappadocia, for having disdained to marry his sister, <lb/>
            he kindly received his brother Orophernes, who had been <lb/>
            unjustly deprived of the throne, and who came to him as a <lb/>
            suppliant; and, rejoicing that a plausible pretext for war was <lb/>
            afforded him, determined to reinstate him in his dominions. <lb/>
            But Orophemes, with extreme ingratitude, having entered <lb/>
            into a compact with the people of Antioch, at that time en­ <lb/>
            raged against Antiochus, formed a plot to expel him from his <lb/>
            throne by whom he was to have been restored to his own <lb/>
            The conspiracy being discovered, Demetrius spared indeed <lb/>
            the life of Orophernes, that Ariarathes might not be freed <lb/>
            from the dread of war on the part of his brother, but caused <lb/>
            him to be apprehended, and kept a close prisoner at Seleucia. <lb/>
            Nor were the people of Antioch so alarmed at this discovery as <lb/>
            to desist from their rebellion. Being in consequence attacked <lb/>
            by Demetrius, but receiving aid from Ptolemy king of Egypt, <lb/>
            Attalus king of Asia,* and Ariarathes of Cappadocia, they <lb/>
            suborned one Bala, a young man of mean condition, to claim <lb/>
            the throne of Syria, on pretence that it had been his father's, <lb/>
            by force of arms; and that nothing might be wanting to ren­ <lb/>
            der him insolent, the name of Alexander was given him, and <lb/>
            he was reported to be the son of King Antiochus. Aud such <lb/>
            was the detestation of Demetrius among all classes, that not <lb/>
            only royal power, but also nobility of birth, was unanimously <lb/>
            attributed to his rival. Alexander, in consequence, amidst <lb/>
            this wonderful change of fortune, forgetful of his original <lb/>
            meanness, and supported by the strength of almost all the <lb/>
            east, made war upon Demetrius, and, having defeated him, <lb/>
            deprived him at once of his throne and his life. Demetrius, <lb/>
            however, did not want courage to resist him in the field; for <lb/>
            he both routed the enemy in the first encounter, and, when <lb/>
            the kings renewed the contest, he killed several thousands in <lb/>
            the struggle. But at last he fell, with his spirit still unsub­ <lb/>
            dued, and fighting most valiantly, among the thickest of the <lb/>
            enemy.</p>
          <p>II. At the commencement of the war, Demetrius had <lb/>
            entrusted two of his sons to a friend of his at Cnidus, with a <note type="footnote"> * Rege Asiœ.] King of Pergamus, where he reigned twenty years, <lb/>

            large quantity of treasure, that they might be removed from <lb/>
            the perils of the war, and might be preserved, if fortune <lb/>
            should so order it, to avenge their father's death. The elder <lb/>
            of the two, Demetrius, who had passed the age of boyhood, <lb/>
            hearing of the luxurious life of Alexander (whom his unex <lb/>
            pected grandeur, and the fascination of enjoyments to which <lb/>
            he was a stranger, held captive as it were in his palace, <lb/>
            idling away his days among troops of concubines), fell upon <lb/>
            him, with the assistance of some Cretans, when he was quite <lb/>
            at his ease, and free from all apprehension of danger. The <lb/>
            people of Antioch, too, to atone for their injuries to the father <lb/>
            by new services, devoted themselves to him; and his father's <lb/>
            soldiers, fired with love for the young prince, and preferring <lb/>
            the obligation of their former oath to the haughty rule of the <lb/>
            new king, ranged themselves on the side of Demetrius; and <lb/>
            thus Alexander, cast down with no less violent a freak of for­ <lb/>
            tune than that with which he had been raised, was defeated <lb/>
            and killed in the first battle, paying the penalty of his conduct <lb/>
            both to Demetrius whom he had slain, and to Antiochus, from <lb/>
            whom he had pretended to derive his birth.</p>

          <p>I. DEMETRIUS, having gained possession of his fathers <lb/>
            throne, and being spoiled by his good fortune, fell, from the <lb/>
            effects of the vices of youth, into habits of indolence, and in­ <lb/>
            curred as much contempt for his slothfulness, as his father had <lb/>
            incurred hatred for his pride. As the cities, in consequence, <lb/>
            began every where to revolt from his government, he resolved, <lb/>
            in order to wipe off the stain of effeminacy from his character, <lb/>
            to make war upon the Parthians. The people of the east <lb/>
            beheld his approach with pleasure, both on account of the <lb/>
            cruelty of Arsacides,* king of the Parthians, and because <note type="footnote"> * He that Justin calls Arsacides was the sixth of the Arsacidæ, ot </note> <note type="footnote"> R 2 </note> <pb n="244"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.XXXVI. CH.II. </note> <lb/>
            having been accustomed to the old government of the Mace­ <lb/>
            donians, they viewed the pride of the new race with indigna­ <lb/>
            tion. Being assisted, accordingly, by auxiliary troops from <lb/>
            the Persians, Elymæans, and Bactrians, he routed the Persians <lb/>
            in several pitched battles. At length, however, being deceived <lb/>
            by a pretended offer of peace, he was made prisoner, and <lb/>
            being led from city to city,* was shown as a spectacle to the <lb/>
            people that had revolted, in mockery of the favour that they <lb/>
            had shown him. Being afterwards sent into Hyrcania, he was <lb/>
            treated kindly, and suitably to the dignity of his former con <lb/>
            dition.</p>
          <p>During the course of these proceedings, Trypho, in Syria, <lb/>
            who had exerted his efforts to be made by the people guardian <lb/>
            to Antiochus, the step-son of Demetrius, killed his ward, and <lb/>
            seized upon the Syrian throne. When he had enjoyed it for <lb/>
            some time, and the liking of the people for his new govern­ <lb/>
            ment began at length to wear off, he was defeated in a battle <lb/>
            by Antiochus, the brother of Demetrius, who was then quite a <lb/>
            boy, and who had been educated in Asia; and the throne of <lb/>
            Syria again returned to the family of Demetrius.</p>
          <p>Antiochus, remembering that his father had been hated for <lb/>
            his pride, and his brother despised for his indolence, was <lb/>
            anxious not to fall into the same vices, and having married <lb/>
            Cleopatra, his brother's wife, proceeded to make war, with the <lb/>
            utmost vigour, on the provinces that had revolted through the <lb/>
            badness t of his brother's government, and, after subduing <lb/>
            them, re-united them to his dominions. He also reduced the <lb/>
            Jews, who, during the Macedonian rule under his father <lb/>
            Demetrius, had recovered their liberty by force of arms; and <lb/>
            whose strength was such, that they would submit to no Mace­ <lb/>
            donian king after him, but, electing rulers from their own <lb/>

            Israhel were their kings. But a prosperous family of ten sons <lb/>
            made Israhel more famous than any of his ancestors. Having <lb/>
            divided his kingdom, in consequence, into ten governments, he <lb/>
            committed them to his sons, and called the whole people Jews <lb/>
            from Judas, who died soon after the division, and ordered his <lb/>
            memory to be held in veneration by them all, as his portion <lb/>
            was shared among them. The youngest of the brothers was <lb/>
            Joseph, whom the others, fearing his extraordinary abilities, <lb/>
            secretly made prisoner, and sold to some foreign merchants. <lb/>
            Being carried by them into Egypt, and having there, by <lb/>
            his great powers of mind, made himself master of the <lb/>
            arts of magic, he found in a short time great favour with <lb/>
            the king; for he was eminently skilled in prodigies, and was <lb/>
            the first to establish the science of interpreting dreams; and <lb/>
            nothing, indeed, of divine or human law seems to have been <lb/>
            unknown to him ; so that he foretold a dearth in the land some <lb/>
            years before it happened, and all Egypt would have perished <lb/>
            by famine, had not the king, by his advice, ordered the corn <lb/>
            to be laid up for several years; such being the proofs of his <lb/>
            knowledge, that his admonitions seemed to proceed, not from <lb/>
            a mortal, but a god. His son was Moses, whom, besides the <lb/>
            inheritance of his father's knowledge, the comeliness of <lb/>
            his person also recommended. But the Egyptians, being <lb/>
            troubled with scabies and leprosy, and moved by some oracu­ <lb/>
            lar prediction, expelled him, with those who had the disease, <lb/>
            out of Egypt, that the distemper might not spread among a <lb/>
            greater number. Becoming leader, accordingly, of the exiles, <lb/>
            he carried off by stealth the sacred utensils of the Egyptians, <lb/>
            who, endeavouring to recover them by force of arms, were <lb/>
            obliged by tempests to return home; and Moses, having <lb/>
            reached Damascus, the birth-place of his forefathers, took <lb/>
            possession of mount Sinai, on his arrival at which, after having <note type="footnote"> * Wetzel's text has ex regina Semiramide, but I have thought proper <lb/>

            suffered, together with his followers, from a seven days' fast <lb/>
            in the deserts of Arabia, he consecrated every seventh day <lb/>
            (according to the present custom of the nation) for a fast-day, <lb/>
            and to be perpetually called a sabbath, because that day had <lb/>
            ended at once their hunger and their wanderings. And as they <lb/>
            remembered that they had been driven from Egypt for fear <lb/>
            of spreading infection, they took care, in order that they might <lb/>
            not become odious, from the same cause, to the inhabitants of <lb/>
            the country, to have no communication with strangers; a rule <lb/>
            which, from having been adopted on that particular occasion, <lb/>
            gradually became a custom and part of their religion. After <lb/>
            the death of Moses, his son Aruas* was made priest for cele­ <lb/>
            brating the rites which they brought from Egypt, and soon <lb/>
            after created king; and ever afterwards it was a custom among <lb/>
            the Jews to have the same chiefs both for kings and priests ; <lb/>
            and, by uniting religion with the administration of justice, it <lb/>
            is almost incredible how powerful they became.</p>

            duties on balm,t which is produced only in that country ; for <lb/>
            there is a valley, encircled with an unbroken ridge of hills, as <lb/>
            it were a wall, in the form of a camp, the space enclosed being <lb/>
            about two hundred acres, and called by the name of Hierichus; ‡ <lb/>
            in which valley there is a wood, remarkable both for its fer­ <lb/>
            tility and pleasantness, and chequered with groves of palm <lb/>
            and balm-trees. The balm-trees resemble pitch-trees in <lb/>
            shape, except that they are not so tall, and are dressed after <lb/>
            the manner of vines ; and at a certain season of the year they <lb/>
            exude the balm. But the place is not less admired for the <note type="footnote"> * A corruption of Aaron. </note><note type="footnote"> t Opobalsami.] In Gen. xxxvii. 25; xliii. 11, we find that Canaan <lb/>

            tree (balsami arbor) grew,” says Origen, "in Judæa, only within a <lb/>
            space of about twenty acres, but after the Romans became masters of <lb/>

            to that of the vine, and its leaves to those of rue, but whiter and <lb/>

            Syria was passing from hand to hand among its new sovereigns, <lb/>
            King Attalus in Asia polluted a most flourishing kingdom, <lb/>
            which he inherited from his uncle Eumenes, by murders of <lb/>
            his friends and executions of his relatives, pretending some­ <lb/>
            times that his old mother, and sometimes his wife Berenice, <lb/>
            had been destroyed by their wicked contrivances. After this <note type="footnote"> * Tepidi aéris naturalia quœdam et perpetua apricitas inest.] Such is <lb/>

            opacitas, which Tauchnitz and Dübner have adopted. " Salmasius, on <lb/>
            Solinus, p. 990, says that not every place exposed to the sun is <lb/>

            for his crimes to the manes of those whom he had murdered. <lb/>
            Abandoning the government of his kingdom, too, he employed <lb/>
            himself in digging and sowing in his garden, mixing noxious <lb/>
            , herbs with harmless ones, and sending them all indiscrimi­ <lb/>
            nately, moistened with poisonous juices, as special presents <lb/>
            to his friends. From this employment he turned to that of <lb/>
            working in brass, and amused himself with modelling in wax, <lb/>
            and casting and hammering out brazen figures. He then <lb/>
            proceeded to make a monument for his mother, but while <lb/>
            he was busy about the work, he contracted a disorder from <lb/>
            the heat of the sun, and died on the seventh day afterwards. <lb/>
            By his will the Roman people was appointed his heir.- <lb/>
            There was however a son of Eumenes, named Aristonicus, <lb/>
            not born in wedlock, but of an Ephesian mistress, the daughter <lb/>
            of a player on the harp ; and this young man, after the death <lb/>
            of Attalus, laid claim to, the throne of Asia as having been his <lb/>
            fathers. When he had fought several successful battles <lb/>
            against the provinces, which, from fear of the Romans, refused <lb/>
            to submit to him, and seemed to be established as king, <lb/>
            Asia was assigned by the senate to the command of Licinius <lb/>
            Crassus, who, being more eager to plunder the treasures of <lb/>
            Attalus than to distinguish himself in the field, and fighting <lb/>
            a battle, at the end of the year, with his army in disorder, <lb/>
            was defeated, and paid the penalty for his blind avarice by the <lb/>
            loss of his life. The consul Perperna being sent in his place, <lb/>
            reduced Aristonicus, who was defeated in the first engagement, <lb/>
            under his power, and carried off the treasures of AttaIns, <lb/>
            bequeathed to the Roman people, on ship-board to Rome. <lb/>
            Marcus Aquilius, Perpema's successor, envying his good for­ <lb/>
            tune, hastened, with the utmost expedition, to snatch Aristonicus <lb/>
            from Perperna's hands, as if he ought rather to grace his own <lb/>
            triumph. But the death of Perperna put an end to the rivalry <lb/>

            seilles sent ambassadors to Rome to intercede for the Phocæans <lb/>
            their friends, whose city and even name the senate had ordered <lb/>
            to be destroyed, because, both at that time, and previously in <lb/>
            the war against Antiochus, they had taken up arms against the <lb/>
            Roman people. The embassy obtained from the senate a <lb/>
            pardon for them. Rewards were then bestowed on the princes <lb/>
            who had given aid against Aristonicus; to Mithridates * of <lb/>
            Pontus was allotted Greater Phrygia; to the sons of Ariara­ <lb/>
            thes, king of Cappadocia, who had fallen in that war, were <lb/>
            assigned Lycaonia and Cilicia; and the Roman people were <lb/>
            more faithful to the sons of their ally, than their mother was <lb/>
            to her children, since by the one the kingdom of the young <lb/>
            princes was increased, by the other they were deprived of life. <lb/>
            For Laodice, out of six children, all boys, whom she had by <lb/>
            king Ariarathes (fearing that, when some of them were grown <lb/>
            up, she would not long enjoy the administration of the king­ <lb/>
            dom), killed five by poison; but the care of their relatives <lb/>
            rescued from the barbarous hands of their mother one infant, <lb/>
            who, after the death of Laodice (for the people killed her for <lb/>
            her cruelty), became sole king.</p>
          <p>Mithridates also, being cut off by sudden death, left a son, <lb/>
            who was likewise named Mithridates, and whose greatness was <lb/>
            afterwards such that he surpassed all kings,† not only of his <lb/>
            own but of preceding ages, in glory, and carried on war against <lb/>
            the Romans, with various success, for forty-six years, during <lb/>
            which, though the most eminent generals, Sylla, Lucullus, and <lb/>
            others, and at last, Cnaeus Pompey, overcame him, yet it was <note type="footnote"> * Mithridates surnamed Euergetes, father of Mithridates the Groat. </note><note type="footnote"> t Justin, or Trogus, seems to prefer him to Alexander the Groat. </note> <pb n="250"/>

            only so that he rose greater and more glorious to renew the <lb/>
            contest, and was rendered even more formidable by his defeats <lb/>
            And he died at last, not from being overpowered by his ene­ <lb/>

          <p>II. The future greatness of this prince even signs from heaven <lb/>
            had foretold; for in the year in which he was born, as well as <lb/>
            in that in which he began to reign, a comet blazed forth with <lb/>
            such splendour, for seventy successive days on each occasion, <lb/>
            that the whole sky seemed to be on fire. It covered a fourth <lb/>
            part of the firmament t with its train, and obscured the light <lb/>
            of the sun with its effulgence; and in rising and setting it <lb/>
            took up the space of four hours.‡ During his boyhood his life <lb/>
            was attempted by plots on the part of his guardians, who, <lb/>
            mounting him on a restive horse, forced him to ride and hurl <lb/>
            the javelin ; but when these attempts failed, as his manage­ <lb/>
            ment of the horse was superior to his years, they tried to cut <lb/>
            him off by poison. He, however, being on his guard against <lb/>
            such treachery, frequently took antidotes, and so fortified him­ <lb/>
            self,‡ by exquisite preventives, against their malice, that when <lb/>
            he was an old man, and wished to die by poison, he was unable. <lb/>
            But dreading lest his enemies should effect that by the sword <lb/>
            which they could not accomplish by drugs, he pretended a fancy <lb/>
            for hunting, in the indulgence of which he never went under a <lb/>
            roof, for seven years, either in the city or the country, but <lb/>
            rambled through the forests, and passed his nights in various <lb/>

            accustomed himself to escape from the wild beasts, or pursue <lb/>

          <p>III. When he assumed the government of the kingdom, he <lb/>
            turned his thoughts, not so much to the regulation of his <lb/>
            dominions, as to the enlargement of them. He in conse­ <lb/>
            quence subdued, with extraordinary success, the Scythians, <lb/>
            who had previously been invincible, who had cut off Zopyrion, <lb/>
            the general of Alexander the Great, with an army of thirty <lb/>
            thousand men, who had massacred Cyrus, king of the Persians, <lb/>
            with two hundred thousand, and who bad routed Philip, king <lb/>
            of Macedonia. Having thus increased his forces, he made <lb/>
            himself master of Pontus,* and afterwards of Cappadocia. <lb/>
            Fixing his thoughts on the conquest of Asia,t he went <lb/>
            privately, with some of his friends, out of his kingdom, and <lb/>
            travelled through the whole of it without the knowledge of <lb/>
            any one, making himself acquainted with the situations of the <lb/>
            towns and the nature of the country. He next went into <lb/>
            Bithynia, and, as if he were already master of Asia, took note <lb/>
            of whatever might aid him in attempting the conquest of it. <lb/>
            He then returned into his country, when they had begun to <lb/>
            suppose that be was dead, and found an infant son born to <lb/>
            him, of whom his wife Laodice, who was also his sister, had <lb/>
            been delivered in his absence. But amidst the congratu­ <lb/>
            lations that he received on his arrival, and on the birth of his <lb/>
            son, he was in danger of being poisoned; for his sister and <lb/>
            wife Laodice, believing him dead, had yielded herself to the <lb/>
            embraces of his friends, and, as if she could conceal the crime, <lb/>
            of which she had been guilty, by a greater, prepared poison for <lb/>
            him on his return. Mithridates, however, having notice of her <lb/>
            intention from a female servant, avenged the plot upon the <lb/>
            heads of its contrivers.</p>
          <p>IV. When winter came on, he did not spend his time in <lb/>
            feasts, but in the field, not in idleness, but in exercise, not <lb/>
            among companions in licentiousness, but contending among his <lb/>
            equals in age, either in riding, running, or trials of strength. <lb/>
            He inured his army also, by daily exercise, to endure fatigue <lb/>
            equally with himself; and thus, while he was himself uncon­ <note type="footnote"> * Pontum occwpavit. ] How Pontus, of which he was already master! <lb/>

            querable, he rendered his army unconquerable likewise. En­ <lb/>
            tering then into an alliance with Nicomedes, he invaded <lb/>
            Paphlagonia, and divided it, after it was conquered, among his <lb/>
            allies. But when information reached the senate that it was <lb/>
            in possession of the two kings, they sent ambassadors to both, <lb/>
            desiring that " the country should be restored to its former <lb/>
            condition." Mithridates, thinking himself now a match for <lb/>
            the power of the Romans, haughtily replied, that " the king­ <lb/>
            dom had belonged to his father by inheritance, and that he <lb/>
            wondered that a dispute, which had never been raised against <lb/>
            his father, should be raised against himself;" and, not at all <lb/>
            alarmed by threats, he seized also on Galatia. As for Nico­ <lb/>
            medes, he replied that " as he could not maintain that he had <lb/>
            any right to the country, he would restore it to its legitimate <lb/>
            sovereign;" and, altering his son's name to Pylæmenes, the <lb/>
            common name of the Paphlagonian kings, he assigned it to <lb/>
            him; and thus, as if he had restored the throne to the royal <lb/>
            line, he continued to occupy the country on this frivolous pre­ <lb/>
            text. The ambassadors, when they found themselves thus set <lb/>
            at nought, returned to Rome.</p>

            Laodice, (wbose husband Ariarathes, king of Cappadocia, he <lb/>
            had treacherously cut off by the agency of a certain Gordius,*) <lb/>
            thinking that nothing was gained by the death of the father, <lb/>
            if the young princes should possess themselves of his throne, <lb/>

            he was meditating on this scheme, Nicomedes, king of <lb/>
            Bithynia, proceeded to occupy Cappadocia, while it was left <lb/>
            defenceless by the death of its sovereign; and Mithridates. <lb/>
            on receiving intelligence of his movements, sent assistance <lb/>
            to his sister, on pretence of affection for her, to enable her to <lb/>
            drive Nicomedes out of Cappadocia. But Laodice had already <lb/>
            made a compact to marry Nicomedes ; and Mithridates, being <lb/>
            indignant at this arrangement, expelled the garrisons of <lb/>
            Nicomedes from Cappadocia, and restored the throne to his <lb/>
            sister's son ; an act of the highest merit, had no treachery <lb/>
            followed it. But some months after, he pretended that he <lb/>
            wished to restore Gordius, whom he had used as his agent <lb/>
            in the assassination of Ariarathes, to his country; hoping <lb/>
            that, if the young man opposed his recal, he should have a <lb/>
            pretext for war, or, that if he consented to it, the son might <lb/>
            be taken off by the same instrument by which he had procured <lb/>
            the death of the father. When the young Ariarthes under­ <lb/>
            stood his intention, he expressed great indignation that the <lb/>
            murderer of his father should be recalled from banishment, <lb/>
            especially by his uncle, and assembled a great army. Mithri­ <lb/>
            dates, after bringing into the field eighty thousand foot, ten <lb/>
            thousand horse, and six hundred chariots armed with scythes, <lb/>
            (while Ariarathes, by the aid of the neighbouring princes, had no <lb/>
            less a force), fearing the uncertain event of a battle, turned his <lb/>
            thoughts to treachery, and, inviting the young prince to a <lb/>
            conference, and having, at the same time, a weapon concealed <lb/>
            in his lower garments, he said to the searcher, who was sent <lb/>
            by Ariarathes, after the manner of princes on such occasions, <lb/>
            to examine his person, and who was feeling very carefully <lb/>
            about his groin, that " he had better take care, lest he should <lb/>
            find another sort of weapon than he was seeking." Having <lb/>
            thus covered his treachery with a joke, he killed his nephew, <lb/>
            (after drawing him aside from his friends as if to confer with <lb/>
            him secretly), in the sight of both armies, and bestowed the <lb/>
            kingdom of Cappadocia on his own son, a child eight years <lb/>
            old, giving him the name of Ariarathes, and appointing <lb/>
            Gordius his guardian.</p>
          <p>II. The Cappadocians, however, being harassed by the <lb/>
            cruelty and licentiousness of their rulers, revolted from <lb/>
            Mithridates, and sent for the brother of their king, who was <lb/>
            also called Ariarathes, from Asia where he was being educated <pb n="254"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.XXXVIII. CH.III. </note> <lb/>
            Upon this prince Mithridates again made war, defeated him, <lb/>
            and drove him from Cappadocia; and not long after the young <lb/>
            man died of a disease brought on by anxiety. After his death, <lb/>
            Nicomedes, fearing lest Mithridates, from having added Cappa­ <lb/>
            docia to his dominions, should also seize upon Bithynia which <lb/>
            was near it, instructed a youth, of extraordinary beauty, to <lb/>
            apply for the throne of Bithynia from the senate, as having <lb/>
            been his father's, pretending that Ariarathes had not had two <lb/>
            sons only, but a third. He sent his wife Laodice, also, to <lb/>
            Rome, to testify that her husband had three children born to <lb/>
            him. Mithridates, when he heard of this contrivance, de­ <lb/>
            spatched Gordius, with equal effrontery, to Rome, to assure <lb/>
            the senate that " the young prince, to whom he had assigned <lb/>
            the throne of Cappadocia, was the son of that Ariarathes who <lb/>
            had fallen in the war against Aristonicus when giving assistance <lb/>
            to the Romans." But the senate, perceiving the ambitious <lb/>
            designs of the two kings, who were seizing the dominions of <lb/>
            others on false pretences, took away Cappadocia from Mithri­ <lb/>
            dates, and, to console him, Paphlagonia from Nicomedes; <lb/>
            and that it might not prove an offence to the kings, that any <lb/>
            thing should be taken from them and given to others, both <lb/>
            people were offered their liberty. But the Cappadocians <lb/>
            declined the favour, saying that " their nation could not <lb/>
            subsist without a king." Ariobarzanes was in consequence <lb/>
            appointed their king by the senate.</p>
          <p>III. The king of Armenia, at this time, was Tigranes, who <lb/>
            had long before been committed as a hostage to the Parthians, <lb/>
            but had subsequently been sent back to take possession of his <lb/>
            father's throne. This prince Mithridates was extremely <lb/>
            desirous to engage as an ally in the war, which he had long <lb/>
            meditated, against the Romans. By the agency of Gordius, <lb/>
            accordingly, he prevailed upon him to make war, having not <lb/>
            the least thought of offending the Romans by the act, on <lb/>
            Ariobarzanes, a prince of inactive disposition; and, that no <lb/>
            deceit might seem to be intended, gave him his daughter <lb/>
            Cleopatra in marriage. On the first approach of Tigranes, <lb/>
            Ariobarzanes packed up his baggage and went off to Rome. <lb/>
            Thus, through the instrumentality of Tigranes, Cappadocia <lb/>
            was destined to fall again under the power of Mithridateb. <lb/>
            Nicomedes, too, dying at the same time, his son, who was also <lb/>
            named Nicomedes, was driven from his dominions by Mithri­ <lb/>
             <pb n="255"/>
            , having gone as a suppliant to Rome, it was decreed <lb/>
            late that " both the kings should be restored to their <lb/>
            and Aquilius and Manlius Maltinus* were corn­ <lb/>
            to see the decree executed. On being informed of <lb/>
            ,ling, Mithridates formed an alliance with Tigranes, <lb/>
            lution at once to go to war with the Romans; and <lb/>
            d that the cities and territory that should be taken <lb/>
            nemy should be the share of Mithridates, and that <lb/>
            ers, and all booty that could be carried off, should <lb/>
            Tigranes. In the next place, well understanding <unclear/> <lb/>
            r he was provoking, he sent ambassadors to the <lb/>
            e Gallogræcians, <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ϯ</foreign> the Sarmatians, and the Bastar­ <lb/>
            request aid; for all the time that he had been <lb/>
            war with the Romans, he had been gaining over al. <unclear/> <lb/>
            ons by acts of kindness and liberality. He sent <lb/>
            army from Scythia, and armed the whole eastern <lb/>
            inst the Romans. Accordingly, without much <lb/>
            he defeated Aquilius and Maltinus, who had an <lb/>
            ly composed of Asiatic troops, and having put them <lb/>
            as well as Nicomedes, he was received with great <lb/>
            various cities, in which he found a great quantity of <lb/>
            silver, and vast warlike stores, laid up by the care <lb/>
            princes. Taking possession of these, he remitted <lb/>
            all sorts of debts, public and private, and granted <lb/>
            umunity from tribute‡ for five years. <unclear/> <lb/>

          <p>IV. " It were to be wished," he said, " that it were still in <lb/>
            his power to deliberate whether he should choose peace or war <lb/>
            with the Romans; but that resistance should be offered against <lb/>
            aggressors, not even those doubted who were without hope <lb/>
            of victory; for all men draw the sword against robbers, if not <lb/>
            to save their lives, at least to take revenge. But since it was <lb/>
            not now a question, when they had come to hostilities (not <lb/>
            merely in intention but in the field of battle), they must con­ <lb/>
            sider in what manner, and with what hopes, they could <lb/>
            continue the contest which they had commenced. That he <lb/>
            felt certain of victory, if they had but courage ; and that tha <lb/>
            Romans might be conquered, was known, not more to himself <lb/>
            than to his soldiers, who had routed both Aquilius in Bithynia <lb/>
            and Maltinus in Cappadocia. And if examples from other <lb/>
            - nations would weigh more with them than their own ex­ <lb/>
            perience, he had heard that the Romans had been overthrown <lb/>
            in three battles by Pyrrhus, when he had with him not more <lb/>
            than five thousand Macedonians; he had heard that Hannibal <lb/>
            continued victorious in Italy for sixteen years, and that it was <lb/>
            not the strength of the Romans, but the violence of his own <lb/>
            countrymen's envy and jealousy, that prevented him from <lb/>
            taking the city of Rome itself; he had heard that the people <lb/>
            of Transalpine Gaul had invaded Italy, and founded many <lb/>
            great cities in it, and that the same Gauls had possessed <lb/>
            themselves of a larger territory there than in Asia, though <lb/>
            Asia was considered by no means a warlike country; he had <lb/>
            been informed that Rome was not only taken but conquered <lb/>
            by the Gauls, the top of one hill only being left in possession <lb/>
            of the inhabitants, and that the enemy was not made to retire <lb/>
            by the sword, but by gold. But that the power of the Gauls, <lb/>
            which had always so much alarmed the Romans, he himself <lb/>
            numbered among his own forces; for that these Gauls, wlio <lb/>
            inhabited Asia, differed only in situation from the Gauls who <lb/>
            had settled themselves in Italy; that they had the same ex­ <lb/>
            traction, courage, and mode of fighting; and that, as to <lb/>
            sagacity, the Asiatic Gauls must have more than the others, <lb/>
            inasmuch as they had pursued a longer and more difficult <note type="footnote"> *Justin has given twc examples of direct speeches, xiv 4; xviii. 7. <lb/>

            march through Illyricum and Thrace, having traversed those <lb/>
            territories with almost more labour than it had cost them to <lb/>
            acquire those in which they settled. That he had heard that <lb/>
            Italy itself, since the time that Rome was built, had never <lb/>
            been fairly brought under subjection to her, but that con­ <lb/>
            stantly, year after year, some of its people persisted in con­ <lb/>
            tending for liberty, and others for a share in the government ;* <lb/>
            and that, by many states of Italy, armies of the Romans had <lb/>
            been cut off by the sword, and by others, with a new species <lb/>
            of insult, sent under the yoke ?t But that, not to dwell on <lb/>
            past instances, all Italy, at the present time, was in arms in <lb/>
            the Marsian war, demanding, not liberty, but a participation in <lb/>
            the government and the rights of citizenship. Nor was the <lb/>
            city more grievously harassed by war from its neighbours in <lb/>
            Italy, than by intestine broils among its leading men ; and <lb/>
            that a civil war, indeed, was much more dangerous to it than <lb/>
            an Italian one. At the same time, too, the Cimbri from Ger­ <lb/>
            many, many thousands of wild and savage people, had rushed <lb/>
            upon Italy like a tempest; and that in wars with such enemies, <lb/>
            though the Romans might be able to resist them singly, yet <lb/>
            by them all they must be overpowered; so that he thought <lb/>
            they would even bo too much occupied to make head against <lb/>
            his attack.</p>
          <p>V. " That they ought therefore to take advantage of the <lb/>
            present circumstances, and seize the opportunity of increasing <lb/>
            their power, lest, if they remained inactive- while the Romans <lb/>
            were occupied, they should hereafter find greater difficulty in <lb/>
            contending with them, when they were quiet and unmolested. <lb/>
            For it was not a question whether they should take up <lb/>
            arms or not, but whether they should do so at a time favourable <lb/>
            to themselves or to their enemies. That war, indeed, had <lb/>
            been commenced against him by the Romans, when they took <lb/>
            from him, in his minority, the Greater Phrygia, a country <lb/>
            which they had granted to his father as a recompence for the <lb/>
            succours which he bad afforded them in the war against Ai i- <lb/>
            stonicus, and which Seleucus Callinicus had given to his great- <lb/>
            grandfather Mithridates, as a dowry with his daughter. When <note type="footnote"> * Wetzel has pro jure imperii in his text, but seems to prefer, in his <lb/>

            son been removed from Cappadocia, which he had gained, as a <lb/>
            conqueror, by the common law of nations ? Yet his conquest <lb/>
            had been forced from him by those who had nothing them­ <lb/>

            whatever Gordius or Tigranes did, was imputed to him ; thai <lb/>
            liberty was readily granted by the senate to Cappadocia <lb/>
            (liberty of which they deprived other nations), on purpose to <lb/>
            affront him ; and that when the people of Cappadocia, instead <lb/>
            of the liberty offered them, begged to have Gordius for their <lb/>
            king. they did not obtain their request merely because Gordius <lb/>
            was his friend. That Nicomedes had made war upon him by <lb/>
            their direction ; that when he was going to avenge himself, he <lb/>
            was obstructed by them; and that their pretence for making <lb/>
            war on him at present would be, that he had not given up his <lb/>
            dominions to Nicomedes, the son of a public dancer, to bo <lb/>

            had ventured, not indeed to reduce it, but merely to enter it, <lb/>

            perate than that of Asia, nor any country more fertile or more <lb/>
            attractive from the number of its cities; and that they woul <lb/>
            spend a great part of their time, not as in military service, but <lb/>
            as at a festival, in a war of which it was hard to say whether <lb/>
            it would be more easy or more gainful, as they themselves <lb/>
            might feel assured, if they had but heard of the late riches of <lb/>
            the kingdom of Attalus, or the ancient opulence of Lydia and <lb/>

            with the queen Cleopatra his sister in marriage, was offered by <lb/>
            an embassy to the Ptolemy‡ who was reigning at Cyrene. <lb/>
            Ptolemy, rejoiced at having recovered his brother's throne with­ <lb/>
            out a struggle (for which he knew that his brother's son was <lb/>
            intended, both by his mother Cleopatra and the inclination of <lb/>
            the nobles), but being incensed at all that had opposed his <lb/>
            interests, ordered, as soon as he entered Alexandria, the <lb/>
            partisans of the young prince to be put to death. He also <lb/>
            killed the youth himself on the day of his nuptials (when he <lb/>
            took his mother to wife), amidst the splendour of feasts, the <lb/>
            ceremonies of religion, and in the very embraces of his parent, <lb/>
            and thus went to the couch of his sister stained with the blood <lb/>
            of her child. Nor was he afterwards more merciful to those <lb/>
            of his subjects who had invited him to the throne, for license <lb/>
            to use the sword being given to the foreign soldiers, all places <lb/>
            daily ran with blood. He divorced his sister, too, offering <lb/>
            violence to her daughter, a young maiden, and then taking <lb/>
            her in marriage. The people, terrified at these proceedings, <lb/>
            fled to other countries, and became exiles from their native <lb/>
            soil through fear of death. Ptolemy, in consequence, being <lb/>
            left alone with his soldiers in so large a city, and finding <lb/>
            himself a king, not of men, but of empty houses, invited, by a <lb/>
            proclamation, foreigners to become residents in it. While <lb/>
            people were flocking thither, he went out to meet some <lb/>
            Roman commissioners, Scipio Africanus, Spurius Mummius, <lb/>
            and Lucius Metellus, who had come to inspect the dominions of <lb/>

            lie was cruel to his own sheets ; for he was disagreeable in <lb/>
            countenance, short in stature, and, from his obesity, more like <lb/>
            a beast than a man. This deformity the extraordinary thin­ <lb/>
            ness of his apparel, which was even transparent, made more <lb/>
            remarkable, just as if that was affectedly obtruded on the sight <lb/>
            which by a modest man would have been most carefully con­ <lb/>
            cealed. After the departure of the commissioners, (of whom <lb/>
            African us, as he surveyed the city, was an object of interest <lb/>
            to the Alexandrians), finding that he had become hateful even <lb/>
            to the foreigners whom he had invited, he withdrew secretly, <lb/>
            for fear of plots against his life, into voluntary exile, accom­ <lb/>
            panied by a son that he had by his sister, and by his wife, her <lb/>
            mother's rival, and, having collected an army of mercenaries. <lb/>
            made war at once upon his sister and his country. He <lb/>
            next sent for his eldest son from Cyrene, and put him <lb/>
            to death, when the people began to pull down his statues <lb/>
            and images, and he, imagining that this was done to please <lb/>
            his sister, killed the son that he had by her, and contrived <lb/>
            to have the body, divided into portions and arranged in a chest, <lb/>
            presented to the mother at a feast on his birth-day. This <lb/>
            deed occasioned grief and sorrow, not only to the queen, but <lb/>
            also to the whole city, and threw such a gloom over a banquet <lb/>
            intended to be most joyous, that the whole palace was suddenly <lb/>
            filled with mourning. The attention of the nobility, in <lb/>
            consequence, being turned from feasting to a funeral, they <lb/>
            exhibited the mangled limbs to the people, and let them see, by <lb/>
            the murder of his son, what they were to expect from their king.</p>
          <p>IX. Cleopatra, when the mourning for the loss of her son <lb/>
            was over, finding herself pressed by war on the part of her <lb/>
            brother, sent ambassadors to request aid from Demetrius king of <lb/>
            Syria, a prince whose changes of fortune had been numerous and <lb/>
            remarkable. After making war, as has been said above,. upon <lb/>
            the Parthians, and gaining the victory in several battles, he <lb/>
            was suddenly surprised by an ambuscade, and, having lost his <lb/>
            army, was taken prisoner. Arsacides,t king of the Parthians, <lb/>
            having sent him into Hyrcania, not only paid him, with royal <lb/>
            magnanimity, the respect due to a prince, but gave him his <lb/>
            daughter also in marriage, and promised to recover for him <lb/>
            the throne of Syria, which Trypho had usurped in his absence. <lb/>

            allowed to return, being unable to endure captivity, and <lb/>
            weary of a private, though splendid, life, secretly planned a <lb/>
            mode of escaping to his own country. His counsellor and <lb/>
            companion in the scheme was his friend Callimander, who, <lb/>
            after Demetrius was taken prisoner, had come in a Parthian <lb/>
            dress from Syria, with some guides that he had hired, <lb/>
            through the deserts of Arabia to Babylon. But Phraates, who <lb/>
            had succeeded Arsacides, brought him back, for he was over­ <lb/>
            taken in his flight by the speed of a party of horse sent after <lb/>
            him by a shorter road. When be was brought to the king, <lb/>
            not only pardon, but a testimony of esteem for his fidelity, <lb/>
            was given to Callimander, but as for Demetrius, he sent him <lb/>
            back, after having severely reproached him, into Hyrcania to <lb/>
            his wife, and directed that he should be kept in stricter con­ <lb/>
            finement than before. Some time after, when children that <lb/>
            were born to him had caused him to be more trusted,. he <lb/>
            again attempted flight, with the same friend as his attendant, <lb/>
            but was overtaken, with equal in-fortune, near the borders of <lb/>
            his dominions, and being again brought to the king, was <lb/>
            ordered out of his sight, as a person whom he could not <lb/>
            endure to see. But being then also spared, for the sake of <lb/>
            his wife and children, he was remanded into Hyrcania, the <lb/>
            country of his punishment, and presented with golden dice, <lb/>
            as a reproach for his childish levity. But it was not com­ <lb/>
            passion, or respect for ties of blood, that was the cause of this <lb/>
            extraordinary clemency t of the Parthians toward Demetrius ; <lb/>
            the reason was, that they had some designs on the kingdom <lb/>
            of Syria, and intended to make use of Demetrius against his <lb/>
            brother Antiochus, as circumstances, the course of time, or <lb/>
            the fortune of war, might require.</p>
          <p>X. Antiochus, having heard of their designs, and thinking <lb/>
            it proper to be first in the field, led forth an army, which he <lb/>
            had inured to service by many wars t with his neighbours, <lb/>

            followers, cf whom the greater number were cooks, bakers, <lb/>
            and stage-players, attended on eighty thousand armed men. <lb/>
            Of silver and gold, it is certain, there was such an abundance <lb/>
            that the common soldiers fastened their buskins with gold, <lb/>
            and trod upon the metal for the love of which nations contend <lb/>
            with the sword. Their cooking instruments, too, were 01 <lb/>
            silver, as if they were going to a banquet, not to a field of <lb/>
            battle. Many kings of the east met Antiochus on his march, <lb/>
            offering him themselves and their kingdoms, and expressing <lb/>
            the greatest detestation of Parthian pride. Nor was there <lb/>
            any delay in coming to an engagement. Antiochus, being <lb/>
            victorious in three battles, and having got possession of Babylon, <lb/>
            began to be thought a great man. All the neighbouring <lb/>
            people, in consequence, joining him. nothing was left to the <lb/>
            Parthians but their own countrY. It was then that Phraates <lb/>
            sent Demetrius into Syria, with a body of Parthians, to seize <lb/>
            the throne, so that Antiochus might be recalled fron Parthia <lb/>
            to secure his own dominions. In the meantime, since be could <lb/>
            not overthrow Antiochus by open force, he made attempts <lb/>
            upon him everywhere by stratagem. On account of the <lb/>
            number of his forces, Antiochus had distributed his army, in <lb/>
            winter quarters, through several cities; and this dispersion <lb/>
            was the cause of his ruin; for the cities, finding themselves <lb/>
            harassed by having to furnish supplies, and by the depredations <lb/>
            of the soldiers, revolted to the Parthians, and, on an appointed <lb/>
            day, conspired to fall upon the army divided among them, <lb/>
            so that the several divisions might not be able to assist each <lb/>
            other. News of the attack being brought to Antiochus, he <lb/>
            hastened with that body of troops which he had in winter- <lb/>
            quarters with him, to succour the others that lay nearest. On <lb/>
            his way he was met by the king of the Parthians, with whom <lb/>
            he himself fought more bravely than his troops ; but at last, <lb/>
            as the enemy had the superiority in valour, he was deserted, <lb/>
            through fear on the part of his men, and killed. Phraates had <lb/>
            funeral rites performed for him as a king, and married the <lb/>
            daughter of Demetrius, whom Antiochus had brought with him, <lb/>
            and of whom he had become enamoured. He then began to <lb/>
            regret having sent away Demetrius, and hastily despatched <lb/>
            some troops of horse to fetch him back ; but they found that <lb/>
            prince, who had been in fear of pursuit, already seated on his <lb/>
            throne, and, after doing all they could to no purpose, returned <lb/>
            to their king.</p><pb n="265"/>

          <p>I. AFTER Antiochus and his army were cut off in Persia, his <lb/>
            brother Demetrius, being delivered from confinement* among <lb/>
            the Parthians, and restored to his throne, resolved, while all <lb/>
            S yria was mourning for the loss of the army, to make war upon <lb/>
            Egypt, (just as if his and his brothers wars with the Partisans, <lb/>
            in which one was taken prisoner and the other killed, had had <lb/>
            a fortunate termination), Cleopatra his mother-in-law promis­ <lb/>
            ing him the kingdom of Egypt, as a recompence for the <lb/>
            assistance that he should afford her against her brother. But, <lb/>
            as is often the case, while he was grasping at what belonged to <lb/>
            others, he lost his own by a rebellion in Syria; for the people <lb/>
            of Antioch, in the first place, under the leadership of Trypho, <lb/>
            and from detestation of the pride of their king (which, from <lb/>
            his intercourse with the unfeeling Parthians, had become in­ <lb/>
            tolerable), and afterwards the Apamenians<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ϯ</foreign> and other people <lb/>
            following their example, revolted from Demetrius in his absence <lb/>
            Ptolemy, king of Egypt, too, who was threatened with a war <lb/>
            by him, having learned that his sister Cleopatra had put much <lb/>
            of the wealth of Egypt on ship-board, and fled into Syria to <lb/>
            her daughter and son-in-law Demetrius, sent an Egyptian <lb/>
            youth,‡ the son of a merchant named Protarchus, to claim the <lb/>
            throne of Syria by force of arms, having forged a story, that <lb/>
            he had been admitted into the family of King Antiochus by <note type="footnote"> * Obsidione ] Obsidio for captivitas.— Vorstius. An odd word. But <lb/>

            for their king, if they might but be freed from the insolence of <lb/>
            Demetrius. The name of Alexander was given to the youth, <lb/>
            and great succours were sent him from Egypt. Meanwhile <lb/>
            the body of Antiochus, who had been killed by the king of the <lb/>
            Parthians, arrived in Syria, being sent back in a silver coffin <lb/>
            for burial, and was received with great respect by the different <lb/>
            cities, as well as by the new king, Alexander, in order to see <lb/>
            cure credit to the fiction. This show of affection procured him <lb/>
            extraordinary regard from the people, every one supposing his <lb/>
            tears not counterfeit but real. Demetrius, being defeated by <lb/>
            Alexander, and overwhelmed by misfortunes surrounding hint <lb/>
            on every side, was at last forsaken even by his wife and child­ <lb/>
            ren. Being left, accordingly, with only a few slaves, and <lb/>
            setting sail for Tyre, to shelter himself in the sanctuary of a <lb/>
            temple there, he was killed, as he was leaving the ship, by <lb/>
            order of the governor of the city. One of his sons, Seleucus, <lb/>
            for having assumed the diadem without his mother's consent, <lb/>
            was put to death by her; the other, who, from the size of his <lb/>
            nose was named Grypus,* was made king by his mother, so <lb/>
            far at least that the regal name should belong to him, while all <lb/>
            the power of sovereignty was to remain with herself.</p>
          <p>IT. But Alexander, having secured the throne of Syria, and <lb/>
            being puffed up with success, began, with insolent haughti­ <lb/>
            ness, to show disrespect even to Ptolemy himself, by whom he <lb/>
            had been artfully advanced to royal dignity. Ptolemy, in <lb/>
            consequence, effecting a reconciliation with his sister, pre­ <lb/>
            pared, with his utmost efforts, to overthrow that power, which, <lb/>
            from hatred to Demetrius, he had procured for Alexander by <lb/>
            supplying him with troops. He therefore sent a large force <lb/>
            to the aid of Grypus, and his daughter Tryphæna to many <lb/>
            him, that he might induce the people to support his nephew, <lb/>
            not only by sharing in the war with him, but by contracting <lb/>
            with him this affinity. Nor were his endeavours without <lb/>
            effect; for when the people saw Grypus upheld by the <lb/>
            strength of Egypt, they began by degrees to fall away from <lb/>
            Alexander. A battle then took place between the kings, in <lb/>
            which Alexander was defeated, and fled to Antioch. Here, <note type="footnote"> * Propter nasi magnitudinem cognomen Grypo fuit.] But the adjective <lb/>

            being without money, and pay being wanted for his soldiers, <lb/>
            he ordered a statue of Victory of solid gold, which was in the <lb/>
            temple of Jupiter, to be removed, palliating the sacrilege <lb/>
            with jests, and saying that "Victory was lent him by Jupiter." <lb/>
            Some days after, having ordered a golden statue of Jupiter <lb/>
            himself, of great weight, to be taken away secretly, and being <lb/>
            caught in the sacrilegious ct, he was forced to flee by a rising <lb/>
            of the people, and being overtaken by a violent storm, and <lb/>
            deserted by his men, he fell into the hands of robbers, and <lb/>
            being brought before Grypus, was put to death.</p>
          <p>Grypus, having thus recovered his father's throne, and being <lb/>
            freed from foreign perils, found his life endangered by a plot <lb/>
            of his own mother; who, after betraying, from desire of power, <lb/>
            her husband Demetrius, and putting to death her other son, <lb/>
            was discontented at her dignity being eclipsed by the victory <lb/>
            of Grypus, and presented him with a cup of poison as he was <lb/>
            returning home from taking exercise. But Grypus, having <lb/>
            received notice of her treacherous intention, desired her (as if <lb/>
            to show as much respect for his mother as she showed for him) <lb/>
            to drink herself first, and, when she refused, pressed her <lb/>
            earnestly, and at last, producing his informant, charged her <lb/>
            with the fact, telling her, " that the only way left to clear herself <lb/>
            from guilt, was, that she should drink what she had offered to <lb/>
            her son." The queen, being thus disconcerted, and her <lb/>
            wickedness turned upon herself, was killed with the poison <lb/>
            which she had prepared for another. Grypus, accordingly, <lb/>
            having securely established his throne, had peace himself, and <lb/>
            secured it for his people, for eight years. At the end of that <lb/>
            time a rival for the throne arose, named Cyzicenus, a brother <lb/>
            of his own by the same mother, and son of his uncle Antiochus. <lb/>
            Grypus having tried to take him off by poison, provoked him <lb/>
            the sooner to contend for the throne with him by force of <lb/>
            arms</p>
          <p>III. During these unnatural contentions in the kingdom of <lb/>
            Syria, Ptolemy,* king of Egypt, died, leaving the kingdom of <lb/>
            Egypt to his wife, and one of her two sons, whichsoever she <lb/>
            herself should choose ; as if the condition of Egypt would be <lb/>
            more quiet than that of Syria had been, when the mother, by <lb/>
            electing one of her sons, would make the other her enemy. <lb/>
            Though she was more inclined to fix on the younger of lief <note type="footnote"> * Ptolemy Physcon. See xxxviii. 8. </note> <pb n="268"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.XXXIX. CH.III."/> <lb/>
            sons, the people obliged her to nominate the elder, from <lb/>
            whom, however, before she gave him the throne, she took away <lb/>
            his wife, compelling him to divorce his sister Cleopatra, whom he <lb/>
            very much loved, and requiring him to marry his younger <lb/>
            sister Selene; a determination as to her daughters not at all <lb/>
            becoming a mother, as she took a husband from one, and gave <lb/>
            him to the other. But Cleopatra being not so much divorced <lb/>
            by her husband, as torn from her husband by her mother, <lb/>
            married Cyzicenus in Syria, and that she might not bring him <lb/>
            the mere name of a wife, carried over to him, as a dowry, the <lb/>
            army of Grypus, which she had induced to desert. Cyzicenus, <lb/>
            thinking himself thus a match for the power of his brother, <lb/>
            gave him battle, but was defeated and put to flight, and <lb/>
            sought refuge in Antioch. Grypus then proceeded to be­ <lb/>
            siege Antioch, in which Cleopatra, the wife of Cyzicenus, was; <lb/>
            and, when he had taken it, Trypheena, the wife of Grypus, <lb/>
            desired that nothing should be searched for before his sister <lb/>
            Cleopatra, not that she might relieve her in her captivity, <lb/>
            but that she might not escape the sufferings of captivity ; <lb/>
            since she had invaded the kingdom chiefly from envy towards <lb/>
            her, and by marrying the enemy of her sister had made her­ <lb/>
            self her enemy.. She also charged her with bringing a foreign <lb/>
            army to decide the disputes between the brothers, and with <lb/>
            having married out of Egypt, when she was divorced from her <lb/>
            brother, contrary to the will of her mother. Grypus, on the <lb/>
            other hand, besought her, that "he might not be driven to <lb/>
            commit so heinous a crime;" saying, that " by none of his <lb/>
            forefathers, in the course of so many civil and foreign wars, <lb/>
            had cruelties after victory been inflicted upon women, whom <lb/>
            their sex itself protected from the perils of war and from ill- <lb/>
            treatment on the part of the conquerors ; and that in her <lb/>
            case, besides the common practice of people at war, there <lb/>
            was added the closest tie of blood, for she was the full <lb/>
            sister of her who would treat her so cruelly, his own cousin, <lb/>
            and aunt to their children." In addition to these obligations <lb/>
            of relationship, he mentioned also the superstitious regard paid <lb/>
            to the temple in which she had taken refuge, observing that <lb/>
            " the gods were so much the more religiously to be revered by <lb/>
            him, as he had been the better enabled to conquer by their <note type="footnote"> * Cleopatra, by marrying Cyzicenus the enemy of Tryphæna, <lb/>
            became herself Tryphæna's enemy. </note> <pb n="269"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="B.C. 110—84.]"/> <lb/>
            favour and protection ; and that neither by killing her would <lb/>
            he diminish the strength of Cyzicenus, nor increase it by re­ <lb/>
            storing her to him." But the more Grypus held back, the <lb/>
            more was Tryphæna excited with a womanish pertinacity, <lb/>
            fancying that her husband's observations proceeded not from <lb/>
            pity but from love. Summoning some soldiers herself, there­ <lb/>
            fore, she despatched a party to kill her sister. They, going <lb/>
            into the temple, and not being able to drag her away, cut off <lb/>
            her hands while she was embracing the statue of the goddess. <lb/>
            Soon after Cleopatra expired, uttering imprecations on her <lb/>
            unnatural murderers, and commending the avenging of her <lb/>
            fate to the outraged deities. And not long after, another <lb/>
            battle being fought, Cyzicenus, being victorious, took Try­ <lb/>
            phæna, the wife of Grypus, who had just before killed her <lb/>
            sister, prisoner, and by putting her to death made atonement <lb/>
            to the manes of his wife.</p>
          <p>IV. In Egypt, Cleopatra, being dissatisfied at having her <lb/>
            son Ptolemy to share her throne, excited the people against <lb/>
            him, and taking from him his wife Selene (the more ignomini <lb/>
            ously, as he had now two children by her), obliged him to go <lb/>
            into exile, sending, at the same time, for her younger son <lb/>
            Alexander, and making him king in his brother's room. Nor <lb/>
            was she content with driving her son from the throne, but <lb/>
            pursued him with her arms while he was living in exile in <lb/>
            Cyprus. After forcing him from thence, she put to death the <lb/>
            general of her troops, because he had let him escape from his <lb/>
            hands alive ; though Ptolemy, indeed, had left the island from <lb/>
            being ashamed to maintain a war against his mother, and not <lb/>
            as being inferior to her in forces.</p>
          <p>Alexander, alarmed at such cruelty on the part of his <lb/>
            mother, deserted her also himself, preferring a life of quiet <lb/>
            and security to royal dignity surrounded with danger; while <lb/>
            Cleopatra, fearing lest her elder son P.tolemy should be <lb/>
            assisted by Cyzicenus to re-establish himself in Egypt, sent <lb/>
            powerful succours to Grypus, and with them Selene, Ptolemy's <lb/>
            wife, to marry the enemy of her former husband. To her son <lb/>
            Alexander she sent messengers to recall him to his country ; <lb/>
            but while, by secret treachery, she was plotting his destruction, <lb/>
            she was anticipated by him and put to death, perishing, not <lb/>
            by the course of nature, but by the hand of her son, and <lb/>
            having, indeed, well deserved so infamous an end, since she <pb n="270"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.XXXIX. CH.V. </note> <lb/>
            had driven her mother. from the bed of her father, had made <lb/>
            her two daughters† widows by alternate marriages with their <lb/>
            brothers, had made war upon one of her sons after sending him <lb/>
            into exile,‡ and plotted against the life of the other § after <lb/>
            depriving him of his throne.</p>
          <p>V. Neither did so unnatural a murder, on the part of <lb/>
            Alexander, go unpunished ; for as soon as it was known that <lb/>
            the mother had been killed by the wickedness of her son, he <lb/>
            was driven by an insurrection of the people, into banishment, <lb/>
            and the crown was restored to Ptolemy, who was recalled, <lb/>
            because he had refused to make war against his mother, and <lb/>
            to take from his brother by force of arms what he himself had <lb/>
            previously possessed. During the course of these proceedings, <lb/>
            his natural brother,∥ to whom his father had left the kingdom <lb/>
            of Cyrenæ by will, died, appointing the Roman people his <lb/>
            heir; for the fortune of Rome, not content with the limits of <lb/>
            Italy, bad now begun to extend itself to the kingdoms of the <lb/>
            east. Thus that part of Africa became a province of the <lb/>
            Roman empire ; and soon afterwards Crete and Cilicia, being <lb/>
            subdued in the war against the pirates, were likewise made <lb/>
            provinces. In consequence, the kingdoms of Syria and Egypt, <lb/>
            which had been accustomed to aggrandize themselves by wars <lb/>
            with their neighbours, being now confined by the vicinity of <lb/>
            the Romans, and deprived of all opportunity of extending their <lb/>
            frontiers, employed their strength to the injury of one another, <lb/>
            so that, being exhausted by continual battles, they fell into <lb/>
            contempt with their neighbours, and became a prey to the <lb/>
            people of Arabia, a nation previously regarded as unwarlike. <lb/>
            Their king Erotimus, relying on his seven hundred sons, <lb/>
            whom he had had by his concubines, and dividing his forces, <lb/>
            infested at one time Egypt, and another Syria, and procured <lb/>
            a great name for the Arabians, by exhausting the strength <lb/>
            of their neighbours. <note type="footnote"> * Her mother Cleopatra. See xxxviii. 8, supra med. </note><note type="footnote"> t Cleopatra and Selene. See c. 3, init. and the beginning of this <lb/>

          <p>I. AFTER the kings and kingdom of Syria had been exhaust <lb/>
            ed by unintermitting wars, occasioned by the mutual animosi <lb/>
            ties of brothers, and by sons succeeding to the quarrels of their <lb/>
            fathers, the people began to look for relief from foreign parts, <lb/>
            and to think of choosing a king from among the sovereigns of <lb/>
            other nations. Some therefore advised that they should take <lb/>
            Mithridates of Pontus, others Ptolemy of Egypt, but it being <lb/>
            considered that Mithridates was engaged in war with the <lb/>
            Romans, and that Ptolemy had always been an enemy to Syria, <lb/>
            the thoughts of all were directed to Tigranes king of Armenia, <lb/>
            who, in addition to the strength of his own kingdom, was <lb/>
            supported by an alliance with Parthia, and by a matrimonial <lb/>
            connection with Mithridates. Tigranes, accordingly, being <lb/>
            invited to the throne of Syria, enjoyed a most tranquil reign <lb/>
            over it for eighteen years, without having occasion to go to war <lb/>
            either to attack others or to defend himself.</p>
          <p>II. But Syria, though unmolested by enemies, was laid <lb/>
            waste by an earthquake, in which a hundred and seventy thou­ <lb/>
            sand people, and several cities, were destroyed; a portent which <lb/>
            the soothsayers declared " to presage a change in things."</p>
          <p>After Tigranes was conquered by Lucullus, Antiochus, the <lb/>
            son of Cyzicenus, was made king of Syria by his authority. <lb/>
            But what Lucullus gave, Pompey soon after took away; telling <lb/>
            him, when he made application for the crown, that "he wouldnot <lb/>
            give Syria, even if willing to accept him, and much less if <lb/>
            unwilling, a king, who for eighteen years, during which Tigra­ <lb/>
            nes had governed Syria, had lain hid in a corner of Cilicia, <lb/>
            and now, when Tigranes was conquered by the Romans, asked <lb/>
            for the reward of other men's labours. Accordingly, as he had <lb/>
            not taken the throne from Tigranes while he held it, so he <lb/>
            would not give Antiochus what he himself had yielded to <lb/>
            Tigranes, and what he would not know how to defend, lest <lb/>
            he should again expose Syria to the depredations of the Jews <lb/>
            and Arabians." He in consequence reduced Syria to the con­ <lb/>
            dition of a province, and the whole east, through the dissensions <lb/>
            of kings of the same blood, fell by degrees under the power <lb/>
            of the Romans. <pb n="272"/>

          <p>1. THE Parthians, in whose hands the empire of the east <lb/>
            now is, having divided the world, as it were, with the Romans, <lb/>
            were originally exiles from Scythia. This is apparent from <lb/>
            their very name ; for in the Scythian language exiles are <lb/>
            called Parthi. During the time of the Assyrians and Medes, <lb/>
            they were the most obscure of all the people of the east. <lb/>
            Subsequently, too, when the empire of the east was transferred <lb/>
            from the Medes to the Persians, they were but as a herd <lb/>
            without a name, and fell under the power of the stronger. At <lb/>
            last they became subject to the Macedonians, when they <lb/>
            conquered the east; so that it must seem wonderful to every <lb/>
            one, that they should have reached such a height of good <lb/>
            fortune as to rule over those nations under whose sway they <lb/>
            had been merely slaves. Being assailed by the Romans, also, <lb/>
            in three wars, under the conduct of the greatest generals, and <lb/>
            at the most flourishing period of the republic, they alone, of <lb/>
            all nations, were not only a match for them, but came oft <lb/>
            victorious ; though it may have been a greater glory to them, <lb/>
            indeed, to have been able to rise amidst the Assyrian, Median, <lb/>
            and Persian empires, so celebrated of old, and the most <lb/>
            powerful dominion of Bactria, peopled with a thousand cities, <lb/>
            than to have been victorious in war against a people that <lb/>
            came from a distance ; especially when they were continually <lb/>
            harassed by severe wars with the Scythians and other neigh­ <lb/>
            bouring nations, and pressed with various other formidable <lb/>
            contests.</p>
          <p>The Parthians, being forced to quit Scythia by discord at <lb/>
            nome, gradually settled in the deserts betwixt Hyrcania, the <lb/>
            Dahæ, the Arei, the Sparni * and Marsiani. They then <lb/>
            advanced their borders, though their neighbours, who at first <lb/>
            made no opposition, at length endeavoured to prevent them, <note type="footnote"> * Wetzel has Spartanos in his text, but observes in his note, that <lb/>
            the right reading is unquestionably Sparnos, the Sparni being men­ <lb/>
            tioned by Strabo in conjunction with the Dahæ. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="273"/>
            to such an extent, that they not only got possession of the <lb/>
            vast level plains, but also of steep hills, and heights of the <lb/>
            mountains; and hence it is that an excess of heat or cold <lb/>
            prevails in most parts of the Parthian territories; since the <lb/>
            snow is troublesome on the higher grounds, and the heat in <lb/>
            the plains.</p>
          <p>II. The government of the nation, after their revolt from <lb/>
            the Macedonian power, was in the hands of kings. Next to <lb/>
            the royal authority is the order of the people,. from which <lb/>
            they take generals in war and magistrates in peace. Their <lb/>
            language is something between those of the Scythians and <lb/>
            Medes, being a compound of both. Their dress was formerly <lb/>
            of a fashion peculiar to themselves; afterwards, when their <lb/>
            power had increased, it was like that of the Medes, light and <lb/>
            full flowing. The fashion of their arms is that of their own <lb/>
            country and of Scythia.† They have an army, not like other <lb/>
            nations, of free men, but chiefly consisting of slaves, the <lb/>
            numbers of whom daily increase, the power of manumission <lb/>
            being allowed to none, and all their offspring, in consequence, <lb/>
            being horn slaves. These bondmen they bring up as carefully <lb/>
            as their own children, and teach them, with great pains, the <lb/>
            arts of riding and shooting with the bow. As any one is <lb/>
            eminent in wealth, so he furnishes the king with a propor­ <lb/>
            tionate number of horsemen for war. Indeed when fifty <lb/>
            thousand cavalry encountered Antony, as he was making war <lb/>
            upon Parthia, only four hundred of them were free men.</p>
          <p>Of engaging with the enemy in close fight, and of taking <lb/>
            cities by siege, they know nothing. They fight on horseback, <lb/>
            cither galloping forward or turning their backs. Often, too, <lb/>
            they counterfeit flight, that they may throw their pursuers off <lb/>
            their guard against being wounded by their arrows. The <lb/>
            signal for battle among them is given, not by trumpet, but <lb/>
            by drum. Nor are they able to fight long : but they would be <lb/>
            irresistible, if their vigour and perseverance were equal to the <lb/>
            fury of their onset. In general they retire before the enemy <lb/>
            in the very heat of the engagement, and, soon after their <note type="footnote"> * Populorum.] This word is undoubtedly corrrupt. J. F Gronovius <lb/>
            would alter it to Optimatum. Procerum would perhaps be better. </note><note type="footnote"> + Patrius et Scythicus mos.] He seems to mean that their arms were <lb/>
            partly of their own contrivance, and partly adopted from the Scy­ <lb/>
            thians. </note> <note type="footnote"> T </note> <pb n="274"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.XLI. CH.IV. </note> <lb/>
            retreat, return to the battle afresh; so that, when you feel most <lb/>
            certain that you have conquered them, you have still to meet <lb/>
            the greatest danger from them. Their armour, and that of <lb/>
            their horses, is formed of plates, lapping over one another like <lb/>
            the feathers of a bird, and covers both man and horse entirely* <lb/>
            Of gold and silver, except for adorning their arms, they make <lb/>
            no use.</p>
          <p>III. Each man has several wives, for the sake of gratifying <lb/>
            desire with different objects. They punish no crime more <lb/>
            severely than adultery, and accordingly they not only exclude <lb/>
            their women from entertainments, but forbid them the very <lb/>
            sight of men. They eat no flesh but that which they take in <lb/>
            hunting. They ride on horseback on all occasions ; on horses <lb/>
            they go to war, and to feasts; on horses they discharge public <lb/>
            and private duties; on horses they go abroad, meet together, <lb/>
            traffic, and converse. Indeed the difference between slaves <lb/>
            and freemen is, that slaves go on foot, but freemen only on <lb/>
            horseback. Their general mode of sepulture is dilaniation by <lb/>
            birds or dogs; the bare bones they at last bury in the ground <lb/>
            In their superstitions and worship of the gods, the principal <lb/>
            veneration is paid to rivers. The disposition of the people <lb/>
            is proud, quarrelsome, faithless, and insolent; for a certain <lb/>
            roughness of behaviour they think becoming to men, and <lb/>
            gentleness only to women. They are always restless, and <lb/>
            ready for any commotion, at home or abroad; taciturn by <lb/>
            nature; more ready to act than speak, and consequently <lb/>
            shrouding both their successes and miscarriages in silence. <lb/>
            They obey their princes, not from humility, but from fear. <lb/>
            They are libidinous, but frugal in diet. To their word or <lb/>
            promise they have no regard, except as far as suits their <lb/>
            interest.</p>
          <p>IV. After the death of Alexander the Great, when the <lb/>
            kingdoms of the east were divided among his successors, the <lb/>
            government of Parthia was committed to Stasanor, a foreign <note type="footnote"> Credas simulacra moveri <lb/>

            ally, because none of the Macedonians would deign to accept <lb/>
            it. Subsequently, when the Macedonians were divided into <lb/>
            parties by civil discord, the Parthians, with the other people <lb/>
            of Upper Asia, followed Eumenes, and, when he was defeated, <lb/>
            went over to Antigonus. After his death they were under the <lb/>
            rule of Seleucus Nicator, and then under Antiochus and his <lb/>
            successors, from whose great-grandson Seleucus they first <lb/>
            revolted, in the first Punic war, when Lucius Manlius Vulso <lb/>
            and Marcus Attilius Regulus were consuls. For their revolt, <lb/>
            the dispute between the two brothers, Seleucus and Antiochus, <lb/>
            procured them impunity ; for while they sought to wrest the <lb/>
            throne from one another, they neglected to pursue the revolters.</p>
          <p>At the same period, also, Theodotus, governor of the thou­ <lb/>
            sand cities of Bactria, revolted, and assumed the title of king; <lb/>
            and all the other people of the east, influenced by bis example, <lb/>
            fell away from the Macedonians. One Arsaces, a man of <lb/>
            uncertain origin, but of undisputed bravery, happened to arise <lb/>
            at this time; and he, who was accustomed to live by plunder <lb/>
            and depredations, hearing a report that Seleucus was overcome <lb/>
            by the Gauls in Asia, and being consequently freed from dread <lb/>
            of that prince, invaded Parthia with a band of marauders, <lb/>
            overthrew Andragoras his lieutenant, and, after putting him <lb/>
            to death, took upon himself the government of the country. <lb/>
            Not long alter, too, he made himself master of Hyrcania, and <lb/>
            thus, invested with authority over two nations, raised a largo <lb/>
            army, through fear of Seleucus and Theodotus, king of the <lb/>
            Bactrians. But being soon relieved of his fears by the death <lb/>
            of Theodotus, he made peace and an alliance with his son, <lb/>
            who was also named Theodotus; and not long aftei, engaging <lb/>
            with king Seleucus, who came to take vengeance on the re­ <lb/>
            volters, he obtained a victory; and the Parthians observe <lb/>
            the day on which it was gained with great solemnity, as the <lb/>
            date of the commencement of their liberty.</p>
          <p>V. Seleucus being then recalled into Asia by new disturb­ <lb/>
            ances, and respite being thus given to Arsaces, he settled the <lb/>
            Parthian government, levied soldiers, built fortresses, and <lb/>
            strengthened his towns. He founded a city also, called Darn, <lb/>
            in Mount Zapaortenon, of which the situation is such, that <lb/>
            no place can be more secure or more pleasant; for it is so <lb/>
            encircled with steep rocks, that the strength of its position <lb/>
            needs no defenders; and such is the fertility of the adjacent <note type="footnote"> T 2 </note> <pb n="276"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.XLI. CH.VI. </note> <lb/>
            soil, that it is stored with its own produce. Such too is the <lb/>
            plenty of springs and wood, that it is amply supplied with <lb/>
            streams of water, and abounds with all the pleasures of the <lb/>
            chace. Thus Arsaces, having at once acquired and established <lb/>
            a kingdom, and having become no less memorable among the <lb/>
            Parthians than Cyrus among the Persians, Alexander among <lb/>
            the Macedonians, or Romulus among the Romans, died at a <lb/>
            mature old age: and the Parthians paid this honour to his <lb/>
            memory, that they called all their kings thenceforward by the <lb/>
            name of Arsaces. His son and successor on the throne, whose <lb/>
            name was also Arsaces, fought with the greatest bravery <lb/>
            against Antiochus, the son of Seleucus, who was at the head of <lb/>
            a hundred thousand foot and twenty thousand horse, and was <lb/>
            at last taken into alliance with him. The third king of the <lb/>
            Parthians was Priapatius; but he was also called Arsaces, for, <lb/>
            as has just been observed, they distinguished all their kings <lb/>
            by that name, as the Romans use the titles of Cæsar and Au­ <lb/>
            gustus. He, after reigning fifteen years, died, leaving two <lb/>
            sons, Mithridates and Phraates, of whom the elder, Phraates, <lb/>
            being, according to the custom of the nation, heir to the crown, <lb/>
            subdued the Mardi, a strong people, by force of arms, and died <lb/>
            not long after, leaving several sons, whom he set aside, and <lb/>
            left the throne, in preference, to his brother Mithridates, a man <lb/>
            of extraordinary ability, thinking that more was due to the <lb/>
            name of king than to that of father, and that he ought to con­ <lb/>
            sult the interests of his country rather than those of his <lb/>
            children.</p>
          <p>VI. Almost at the same time that Mithridates ascended the <lb/>
            throne among the Parthians, Eucratides began to reign among <lb/>
            the Bactrians; both of them being great men. But the for­ <lb/>
            tune of the Parthians, being the more successful, raised them, <lb/>
            under this prince, to the highest degree of power; while the <lb/>
            Bactrians, harassed with various wars, lost not only their <lb/>
            dominions, but their liberty; for having suffered from conten­ <lb/>
            tions with the Sogdians, the Drangians, and the Indians, they <lb/>
            were at last overcome, as if exhausted, by the weaker* Par­ <lb/>
            thians. Eucratides, however, carried on several wars with <lb/>
            great spirit and though much reduced by his losses in them. <note type="footnote"> * Not weaker with respect to the particular time at which the <lb/>
            Bactrians were exhausted by wars, but to other times, when the <lb/>

            yet, when he was besieged by Demetrius king of the Indians, <lb/>
            with a garrison of only three hundred soldiers, he repulsed, by <lb/>
            continual sallies, a force of sixty thousand enemies.- Having <lb/>
            accordingly escaped, after a five months’ siege, he reduced <lb/>
            India under his power. But as he was returning from the <lb/>
            country, he was killed on his march by his son, with whom he <lb/>
            had shared his throne, and who was so far from concealing the <lb/>
            murder, that, as if he had killed an enemy, and not his father, <lb/>
            he drove his chariot through his blood, and ordered his body <lb/>
            to be cast out unburied</p>
          <p>During the course of these proceedings among the Bac­ <lb/>
            trians, a war arose between the Parthians and Modes, and <lb/>
            after fortune on each side had been some time fluctuating, <lb/>
            victory at length fell to the Parthians; when Mithridates, <lb/>
            enforced with this addition to his power, appointed Bacasis <lb/>
            over Media, while he himself marched into Hyrcania. On his <lb/>
            return from thence, he went to war with the king of the <lb/>
            Elymæns, and having conquered him, added this nation also <lb/>
            to his dominions, and extended the Parthian empire, by <lb/>
            reducing many other tribes under his yoke, from Mount <lb/>
            Caucasus to the river Euphrates. Being then taken ill, he <lb/>
            died in an honourable old age, and not inferior in merit to hit <lb/>
            great-grandfather Arsaces.</p>

            march in vain, they demanded that "either some recompence for <lb/>
            their trouble, or another enemy to attack, should be assigned <lb/>
            them," being offended at the haughty reply which they received, <lb/>
            they began to ravage the country of the Parthians. Phraates, in <lb/>
            consequence, marching against them, left a certain Himerus, <lb/>
            who had gained his favours in the bloom of youth, to take care <lb/>
            of his kingdom. But Himerus, unmindful both of his past <lb/>
            life, and of the duty with which he was entrusted, miserably <lb/>
            harassed the people of Babylon, and many other cities, with <lb/>
            tyrannical cruelties. Phraates himself, meanwhile, took with <lb/>
            him to the war a body of Greeks, who had been made prison­ <lb/>
            ers in the war against Antiochus, and whom he had treated <lb/>
            with great pride and severity, not reflecting that captivity had <lb/>
            not lessened their hostile feelings, and that the indignity of the <lb/>
            outrages which they had suffered must have exasperated them. <lb/>
            As soon therefore as they saw the Persians giving ground, they <lb/>
            went over to the enemy, and executed that revenge for their <lb/>
            captivity, which they had long desired, by a sanguinary destruc­ <lb/>
            tion of the Parthian army and of king Phraates himself.</p>
          <p>II. In his stead Artabanus, his uncle, was made king. The <lb/>
            Scythians, content with their victory, and with having laid <lb/>
            waste Parthia, returned home. Artabanus, making war upon <lb/>
            the Thogarii, received a wound in the arm, of which he imme­ <lb/>
            diately died. He was succeeded by his son Mithridates, to <lb/>
            whom his achievements procured the surname of Great; for, <lb/>
            being fired with a desire to emulate the merit of his ancestors, <lb/>
            he was enabled by the vast powers of his mind to surpass their <lb/>
            renown. He carried on many wars, with great bravery, against <lb/>
            his neighbours, and added many provinces to the Parthian <lb/>
            kingdom. He fought successfully, too, several times, against <lb/>
            the Scythians, and avenged the injuries received from them by <lb/>
            his forefathers. At last he turned his arms against Ortoadistes,* <lb/>
            king of Armenia.</p>
          <p>But since we here make a transition to Armenia, we must <lb/>
            look a little farther back into its origin; for it is not right that so <lb/>
            great a kingdom should be passed in silence, since its territory, <note type="footnote"> * Or rather Artoadistes, as the name is written in six of the old <lb/>
            editions. He is called Artavasdes by Strabo and Plutarch.- Wet. el. </note> <pb n="279"/>
            <note type="margin"> B.C. 1283.] </note> <lb/>
            next to that of Parthia, is of greater extent than any other <lb/>
            kingdom. Armenia, from Cappadocia to the Caspian Sea, <lb/>
            stretches over a space of eleven hundred miles, and is seven <lb/>
            hundred miles in breadth. It was founded by Armenius, the <lb/>
            companion of Jason of Thessaly, whom King Pelias, wishing <lb/>
            to procure his death from dread of his extraordinary ability, <lb/>
            which was dangerous to his throne, despatched on a prescribed <lb/>
            expedition to Colchis, to bring home the fleece of the ram so <lb/>
            celebrated throughout the world; hoping that the man would <lb/>
            lose his life, either in the perils of so long a voyage, or in war <lb/>
            with barbarians so remote. But Jason, having spread abroad <lb/>
            the report of so glorious an enterprise, at which the chief of <lb/>
            the youth from almost all the world * came flocking to him, <lb/>
            collected a band of heroes, who were called Argonauts. Having <lb/>
            brought his troop back safe, and being again driven from <lb/>
            Thessaly by the sons of Pelias, he set out on a second voyage <lb/>
            for Colchis, accompanied by a numerous train of followers (who, <lb/>
            at the fame of his valour, came daily from all parts to join <lb/>
            him), by his wife Medea, whom, having previously divorced her, <lb/>
            he had now received again from compassion for her exile, and <lb/>
            by his step-son Medus, whom she had by Ægeus king of the <lb/>
            Athenians ; and he re-established his father-in-law Æetes† who <lb/>
            had been driven from his throne.</p>
          <p>III. He then carried on great wars with the neighbouring <lb/>
            nations; and of the cities which he took, he added part to the <lb/>
            kingdom of his father-in-law, to make amends for the injury <lb/>
            that he had done him in his former expedition, in which he had <lb/>
            carried off his daughter Medea and put to death his son Ægia­ <lb/>
            leus,‡ and part he assigned to the people that he had brought with <lb/>
            him ; and he is said to have been the first of mankind, after <lb/>
            Hercules and Bacchus (whom tradition declares to have been <lb/>
            kings of the east), that subdued that quarter of the world. <lb/>
            Over some of these nations he appointed Recas and Amphi­ <lb/>
            stratus, the charioteers of Castor and Pollux, to be their rulers. <lb/>
            With the Albanians he formed an alliance, a people who are <lb/>
            said to have followed Hercules out of Italy, from the Alban <note type="footnote"> * A hyperbole; for there were none but Greeks.— WetzeL Faber, for <lb/>

            herds through Italy, and who, remembering their Italian <lb/>
            descent, saluted the soldiers of Pompey in the Mithridatic <lb/>
            war as their brothers. Hence almost the whole east appointed <lb/>
            divine honours, and erected temples, to Jason, as their founder; <lb/>
            temples which Parmenio, one of the generals of Alexander the <lb/>
            Great, caused many years after to be pulled down, that no name <lb/>
            might be more venerated in the east than that of Alexander <lb/>
            After the death of Jason, Medus, emulous of his virtues, built <lb/>
            a city named Medea in honour of his mother, and established <lb/>
            the kingdom of the Medes after his own name, under whose do­ <lb/>
            minion the empire of the east afterwards fell. On the Albanians <lb/>
            border the Amazons, whose queen Thalestris, as many authors <lb/>
            relate, sought the couch of Alexander. Armenius, too, who <lb/>
            was himself a Thessalian, and one of the captains of Jason, <lb/>
            having re-assembled a body of men, who, after the death of Jason <lb/>
            were wandering about, founded Armenia, from the mountains <lb/>
            of which the river Tigris issues, at first with a very small stream, <lb/>
            out after running some distance, is lost in the earth, and then, <lb/>
            flowing five and twenty miles underground,* rises up a great <lb/>
            river in the province of Sophene; and thus it is received into <lb/>
            the marshes of the Euphrates.</p>
          <p>IV. Mithridates king of the Parthians, after his war with <lb/>
            Armenia, was banished from his kingdom for his cruelty by <lb/>
            the Parthian senate. His brother Orodes, who took possession <lb/>
            of the vacant throne, besieged Babylon, whither Mithridates <lb/>
            had fled, for some time, and reduced the people, under the in­ <lb/>
            fluence of famine, to surrender. Mithridates, from confidence <lb/>
            in his relationship to Orodes, voluntarily put himself into his <lb/>
            hands; but Orodes, contemplating him rather as an enemy <lb/>
            than a brother, ordered him to be put to death before his face. <lb/>
            After this, he carried on a war with the Romans, and overthrew <lb/>
            their general Crassus, together with his son and all the Roman <lb/>
            army. His son Pacorus, who was sent to pursue what re­ <lb/>
            mained of the Roman forces, after achieving great actions in <lb/>
            Syria, incurred some jealousy on the part of his father, and <lb/>
            was recalled into Parthia; and during his absence the Parthian <lb/>
            army left in Syria was cut off, with all its commanders, by <note type="footnote"> * Similar instances of rivers entering the ground, and emerging at <lb/>

            Cassius the quæstor of Crassus. Not long after these occurrences <lb/>
            the civil war among the Romans, between Cæsar and Pompey, <lb/>
            broke out, in which the Parthians took the side of Pompey, both <lb/>
            from the friendship that they had formed with him in the Mithri­ <lb/>
            datic war, and because of the death of Crassus, whose son they <lb/>
            understood to be of Cæsar’s party, and supposed that, if Cæsar <lb/>
            were victorious, he would avenge his father's fate. When Pom­ <lb/>
            pey’s party was worsted, they sent assistance to Cassius and Bru­ <lb/>
            tus against Augustus and Antony; and, after the war was ended, <lb/>
            they made an alliance with Labienus, and, under the leadership <lb/>
            of Pacorus, again laid waste Syria and Asia, and assailed, with a <lb/>
            vast force, the camp of Ventidius, who, like Cassius before him, <lb/>
            had routed the Parthian army in the absence of Pacorus. Venti­ <lb/>
            dius, pretending to be afraid, kept himself a long time in his camp, <lb/>
            and suffered the Parthians to insult him. At last, however, <lb/>
            when they were full of security and exultation, he sent out <lb/>
            part of his legions upon them, and the Parthians, put to flight <lb/>
            by their onset, went off in several directions; when Pacorus, <lb/>
            supposing that his fugitive troops had drawn off all the Roman <lb/>
            forces in pursuit of them, attacked Ventidius's camp, as if it <lb/>
            had been left without defenders. Upon this, Ventidius, pouring <lb/>
            forth the rest of his troops, put the whole force of the Par. <lb/>
            thians, with their king Pacorus, to the sword; nor did the <lb/>
            Parthians, in any war, ever suffer a greater slaughter.</p>
          <p>When the news of this discomfiture reached Parthia, Orodes, <lb/>
            the father of Pacorus, who had just before heard that Syria <lb/>
            had been ravaged, and Asia occupied by his Parthians, and <lb/>
            was boasting of his son Pacorus as the conqueror of the Romans, <lb/>
            was affected, on hearing of the death of his son and the de­ <lb/>
            struction of his army, at first with grief, and afterwards with <lb/>
            disorder of the intellect. For several days he neither spoke to <lb/>
            any one, nor took food, nor uttered a sound, so that he seemed to <lb/>
            have become dumb. Some time after, when his sorrow found <lb/>
            vent in words, he did nothing but call upon Pacorus ; Pacorus <lb/>
            seemed to be seen and heard by him; Pacorus appeared to talk <lb/>
            with him, and stand by him; though at other times he mourned <lb/>
            and wept for him as lost. After long indulgence in grief, another <lb/>
            cause of concern troubled the unhappy old man, as he had to de­ <lb/>
            termine which of his thirty sons he should choose for his succes­ <lb/>
            sor in the room of Pacorus. His numerous concubines, from <lb/>
            whom so large a progeny had sprung, were pepetually working <pb n="282"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.XLII. CH.V. </note> <lb/>
            on the old man's feelings, each anxious for her own offspring <lb/>
            But the fate of Parthia, in which it is now. as it were, cus. <lb/>
            tomary that the princes should be assassins of their kindred, <lb/>
            ordained that the most cruel of them all, Phraates by name <lb/>
            should be fixed upon for their king.</p>
          <p>V. Phraates immediately proceeded to kill his father, as <lb/>
            if he would not die, and put to death, also, all his thirty- <lb/>
            brothers. But his murders did not end with his father's sons; <lb/>
            for finding that the nobility began to detest him for his con­ <lb/>
            stant barbarities, he caused his own son, who was grown up, <lb/>
            to be killed, that there might be no one to be nominated king. <lb/>
            On this prince Antony made war, with sixteen effective <lb/>
            legions, for having sent troops against him and Caesar; but <lb/>
            being severely, harassed in several engagements, he was forced <lb/>
            to retreat from Parthia. Phraates, upon this success, becom­ <lb/>
            ing still more insolent, and being guilty of many fresh acts of <lb/>
            cruelty, was driven into exile by his subjects. Having then, <lb/>
            for a long time, wearied the neighbouring people, and at last <lb/>
            the Scythians, with entreaties for aid, he was at last restored <lb/>
            to his throne by a powerful Scythian force. During his <lb/>
            absence, the Parthians had made one Tiridates king, who, when <lb/>
            he heard of the approach of the Scythians, fled with a great <lb/>
            body of his partisans to Cæsar,† who was then carrying on <lb/>
            war in Spain, ‡ taking with him, as a hostage for Cæsar, the <lb/>
            youngest son of Phraates, whom, being but negligently guarded, <lb/>
            he had secretly carried off. Phraates, on hearing of his flight, <lb/>
            immediately sent ambassadors to Caesar, requesting that " his <lb/>
            slave Tiridates, and his son, should be restored to him." <lb/>
            Cæsar, after listening to the embassy of Phraates, and de­ <lb/>
            liberating on the application of Tiridates (for he also had asked <lb/>
            to be restored to his throne, saying that " Parthia would be <lb/>
            wholly in the power of the Romans, if he should hold the <lb/>
            kingdom as a gift from them"), replied, that “ he would <lb/>
            neither give up Tiridates to the Parthians, nor give assistance <lb/>
            to Tiridates against the Parthians." That it might not appear, <lb/>

            their applications, he sent back to Phraates his son without <lb/>
            ransom, and ordered a handsome maintenance to be furnished <lb/>
            to Tiridates, as long as he chose to continue among the <lb/>
            Romans. Some time after, when Cæsar had finished the <lb/>
            Spanish war, and had proceeded to Syria to settle the affairs <lb/>
            of the east, he caused some alarm to Phraates, who was afraid <lb/>
            that he might contemplate an invasion of Parthia. Whatever <lb/>
            prisoners, accordingly, remained of the army of Crassus or <lb/>
            Antony throughout, Parthia, were collected together, and <lb/>
            sent, with the military standards that had been taken, to <lb/>
            Augustus. In addition to this, the sons and grandsons of <lb/>
            Phraates were delivered to Augustus as hostages; and thus <lb/>
            Caesar effected more by the power of his name, than any other <lb/>
            general could have done by his arms</p>

            eastern nations, and of almost the whole world, Trogus re­ <lb/>
            turns home, as if after a long journey in foreign parts, to <lb/>
            relate the rise of the city of Rome, thinking it would be the <lb/>
            mark of an ungrateful citizen, if, after he had set forth the <lb/>
            acts of other nations, he should be silent concerning his native <lb/>
            country alone. He therefore briefly touches on the origin of <lb/>
            the Roman empire, so as neither to exceed the bounds of the <lb/>
            work that he had proposed, nor to pass unnoticed the origin <lb/>
            of a city which is now the mistress of the world.</p>
          <p>The first inhabitants of Italy were the Aborigines, whoso <lb/>
            king, Saturn, is said to have been a man of such extraordinary <lb/>
            justice, that no one was a slave in his reign, or had any private <lb/>
            property, but all things were common to all, and undivided, as <lb/>
            one estate for the use of every one ; in memory of which way <lb/>
            of life, it has been ordered that at the Saturnalia slaves should <lb/>
            everywhere sit down with their masters at the entertainments, <lb/>
            the rank of all being made equal. Italy was accordingly <pb n="284"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="B.XXIII. CH.I."/> <lb/>
            called, from the name of that king, Saturnia; and the hill on <lb/>
            which he dwelt Saturnius, on which now stands the Capitol, <lb/>
            as if Saturn had been dislodged from his seat by Jupiter. <lb/>
            After him, third in descent, they say that Faunus was king, in <lb/>
            whose time Evander came into Italy from Pallanteum, a city <lb/>
            of Arcadia, accompanied with a small band of his countrymen, <lb/>
            to whom Faunus kindly gave land, and the mountain which he <lb/>
            afterwards called Palatium. At the foot of this mountain <lb/>
            he built a temple to the Lycæan god, whom the Greeks call <lb/>
            Pan, and the Romans Lupercus,* the naked statue of the <lb/>
            deity being covered with a goat-skin, in which dress the priests <lb/>
            now run up and down during the Lupercalia at Rome. This <lb/>
            Faunus had a wife named Fatua, who, being constantly filled <lb/>
            with a spirit of divination, gave notice, in fits of frenzy as it <lb/>
            were, of things to come ; and hence, to this day, those who are <lb/>
            accustomed to be thus inspired, are said fatuari. t Of an <lb/>
            illicit connection between a daughter of Faunus and Hercules, <lb/>
            (who, having killed Geryon about that time, was driving his <lb/>
            herds, the prize of his victory, through Italy), was born <lb/>
            Latinus, in whose reign AEneas came from Ilium ‡ into Italy, <lb/>
            after the destruction of Troy by the Greeks, and being <lb/>
            immediately received with hostile demonstrations, led out his <lb/>
            troops into the field, but being first invited to a conference, <lb/>
            raised such admiration of himself in Latinus, that he was both <lb/>
            admitted to a sham of his throne, and became his son-in-law <lb/>
            by a marriage with his daughter Lavinia. After this event, <lb/>
            they had to carry on war in concert against Tumus, king of <lb/>
            the Rutulians, because he had been disappointed of marrying <lb/>
            Lavinia; and in the war both Turnus and Latinus were killed. <lb/>
            AEneas, in consequence, becoming by right of victory master <lb/>
            of both nations, built a city which he called Lavinium, from <lb/>
            the name of his wife. Some time afterwards, he went to war <lb/>
            with Mezentius, king of the Etrurians, and being killed in it, <lb/>
            Ascanius his son succeeded him, who, removing from Lavi. <note type="footnote"> * Lupercus, whose priests were called Luperci, was an ancient rural <lb/>

          <p>II. At length, after many kings had reigned in this city, <lb/>
            Numitor and Amulius became joint sovereigns. But Amulius, <lb/>
            having deprived Numitor, who was the elder, of his share of <lb/>
            the throne, condemned his daughter Rhea to perpetual vir­ <lb/>
            ginity, that no male offspring of Numitor's family might arise <lb/>
            to claim the crown, palliating the injury by an appearance of <lb/>
            honour, so that she might not seem to have been compelled, <lb/>
            but to have been chosen one of the vestal virgins. Being shut <lb/>
            up, accordingly, in a grove sacred to Mars, she gave birth to <lb/>
            two boys, whether the offspring of an illicit connexion with a <lb/>
            mortal, or of the god Mars, is uncertain. This affair becoming <lb/>
            known, Amulius, whose fears were increased by the birth of <lb/>
            twins, ordered the children to be exposed, and threw his <lb/>
            niece into prison, of which ill-treatment she died. Fortune, <lb/>
            however, having a care for the raising of Rome, threw the <lb/>
            children in the way of a she-wolf to be suckled, which, <lb/>
            having lost her cubs, and longing to empty her overcharged <lb/>
            teats, offered herself as a nurse to the infants. As she made <lb/>
            frequent returns to the children, as if they had been her own <lb/>
            offspring, Faustulus, a shepherd, observed her proceedings, <lb/>
            and, withdrawing them from the beast, brought them up in a <lb/>
            rude way of life among his cattle. That they were the sons <lb/>
            of Mars, was believed, as on plain proof, either because they <lb/>
            were born in the grove of Mars, or because they were nursed <lb/>
            by a wolf, which is under the protection of Mars. The names of <lb/>
            the boys were Remus and Romulus. As they grew up among <lb/>
            the shepherds, daily contests in strength increased their <lb/>
            vigour and agility. While they were frequently engaged, with <lb/>
            great activity, in preventing robbers from seizing the cattle, <lb/>
            it happened that Remus, having been taken by the robbers, <lb/>
            was brought before the king,- as if he had himself been <lb/>
            guilty of that which he was endeavouring to prevent in others, <lb/>
            and had been accustomed to make depredations on Numitor's <lb/>
            flocks. He was consequently given up to Numitor for <lb/>
            punishment. But Numitor,t who was touched with compas­ <note type="footnote"> * He was first carried off by the robbers, and then taken prisoner <lb/>

            be one of his exposed grandchildren, and while the resemblance <lb/>
            of his features to those of his daughter, and his age corre­ <lb/>
            sponding with the time of the exposure, kept him in suspense, <lb/>
            Faustulus unexpectedly came in with Romulus, and the origin <lb/>
            of the youths being ascertained from him, a conspiracy was <lb/>
            formed, the young men taking up arms to revenge the death <lb/>
            of their mother, and Numitor to recover the throne of which <lb/>
            he had been deprived.</p>
          <p>III. Amulius being killed, the tnrone was restored to <lb/>
            Numitor, and the city of Rome was founded by the two young <lb/>
            men. A senate was next appointed, consisting of a hundred old <lb/>
            men who were called Fathers. Soon after, as the neighbouring <lb/>
            people disdained to intermarry with shepherds, the Sabine <lb/>
            virgins were seized by force; and the surrounding tribes <lb/>
            being brought under their sway, the sovereignty of Italy, and <lb/>
            afterwards that of the world, was acquired. In those times <lb/>
            kings, instead of diadems, had spears, which the Greeks called <lb/>
            sceptres; for the ancients, from the earliest period, worshipped <lb/>
            spears as gods,. and in memory of this superstition spears <lb/>
            are still given to the statues of the gods.</p>
          <p>In the time of King Tarquin, a company of Phocæans <lb/>
            from Asia, sailing up the Tiber, formed an alliance with <lb/>
            the Romans, and proceeding from thence to the inmost <lb/>
            part of the gulf of Gaul,t built the city of Marseilles amidst <lb/>
            the Ligurians and the savage Gallic tribes, and performed <lb/>
            great exploits there, both in defending themselves against <lb/>
            the fierce Gauls, and in attacking, of themselves, those by <lb/>
            whom they had previously been molested.</p>
          <p>The Phocæans, compelled by the smallness and infertility <lb/>
            of their territory, had applied themselves more to the sea than <lb/>
            to the culture of the ground, supporting themselves by fishing, <lb/>
            merchandise, and above all by piracy, which in those days was <note type="footnote"> * Spears were never worshipped as gods, or certainly not by the <lb/>

            this observation of Justin is abrupt and out of place; nor is the case <lb/>
            different with what follows, for what a leap is it from Romulus to the <lb/>
            Phocæans, who did not become friends to the Romans till two hundred <lb/>
            years after his time !— Wetzel. </note><note type="footnote"> t Galliœ sinus.] The gulf of Lyons. </note> <pb n="287"/>

            thought an honourable occupation.- Venturing accordingly <lb/>
            to visit the remotest shores of the ocean, they came into the <lb/>
            gulf of Gaul and to the mouth of the river Rhone; and, <lb/>
            charmed with the pleasantness of the country, and relating, on <lb/>
            their return home, what they had seen, they tempted others <lb/>
            to go to the same parts. Of the fleet Simos and Protis were <lb/>
            the captains, who applied to the king of the Segobrigii, named <lb/>
            Nannus, in whose territory they were anxious to build a city, <lb/>
            desiring his friendship. On that day, as it happened, the <lb/>
            king was engaged in preparing for the nuptials of his daughter <lb/>
            Gyptis, whom, after the custom of that people, he intended to <lb/>
            give in marriage to a son-in-law to be chosen at the feast. <lb/>
            The suitors having been all invited to the wedding, the Grecian <lb/>
            strangers were also requested to join the festival. The maiden <lb/>
            was then introduced, and being desired by her father to give <lb/>
            water to him whom she chose for her husband, she overlooked <lb/>
            all the rest, and turning to the Greeks, held out water to <lb/>
            Prods, who, from the king's guest becoming his son-in-law, <lb/>
            was presented by his father-in-law with the ground for building <lb/>
            a city. Marseilles was accordingly built near the mouth of <lb/>
            the river Rhone, in a retired bay, and as it were in a corner <lb/>
            of the sea. The Ligurians, jealous of the growing greatness <lb/>
            of the city, harassed the Greeks with continual war; but they, <lb/>
            repelling their attacks, rose to such a degree of strength, that <lb/>
            they conquered their enemies and planted several colonies in <lb/>
            the lands which they captured.</p>
          <p>IV. From the people of Marseilles, therefore, the Gauls <lb/>
            learned a more civilized way of life, their former barbarity <lb/>
            being laid aside or softened; and by them they were taught to <lb/>
            cultivate their lands and to enclose their towns with walls Then <lb/>
            too, they grew accustomed to live according to laws, and not <lb/>
            by violence ; then they learned to prune the vine and plant <lb/>
            the olive; and such a radiance was shed over both men and <lb/>
            things, that it was not Greece which seemed to have immi­ <lb/>
            grated into Gaul, but Gaul that seemed to have been trans­ <lb/>
            planted into Greece.</p>
          <p>After Nannus, king of the Segobrigii, from whom the <lb/>
            ground for building the city had been received, was dead, and <lb/>
            his son Comanus had succeeded to the throne. a certain <note type="footnote"> * Glories habebatur.] See Thucyd. i. 5 ; Hom. Od. iii. 73. </note> <pb n="288"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B.XLIII CH.V. </note> <lb/>
            Lagurian told him that " Marseilles would one day be the <lb/>
            ruin of the neighbouring people, and that he ought to suppress <lb/>
            it in its rise, lest, when it grew stronger, it should overpower <lb/>
            him.” To this prediction he added the following fable: "A bitch <lb/>
            once asked a shepherd, when she was big with young, for a <lb/>
            place to bring forth her puppies ; having obtained it, she re­ <lb/>
            quested again that she might be allowed to bring them up in <lb/>
            the same place ; and at last, when her young were grown up, <lb/>
            and she could depend upon their support, she claimed posses­ <lb/>
            sion of the place as her own. In like manner," he continued, <lb/>
            “ the people of Marseilles, who are now regarded as your <lb/>
            tenants, will one day become masters of your territory." Moved <lb/>
            by these persuasions, the king formed a plan to overthrow <lb/>
            Marseilles ; in pursuance of which, on the day appointed for <lb/>
            the feast of Flora, he sent into the city several stout and able <lb/>
            men, who were admitted as friends ; an additional number he <lb/>
            ordered to be conveyed concealed in wagons, covered over <lb/>
            with baskets and boughs of trees ; while he himself lay hid <lb/>
            among the neighbouring hills, that after the gates had been <lb/>
            opened in the night by the men before mentioned, he might <lb/>
            come up in time to execute the plot, and might fall upon the <lb/>
            city overcome with sleep and the fumes of wine. But a <lb/>
            certain woman, a relative of the king, who had an intrigue <lb/>
            with a Greek youth, revealed the plot to him, through compas­ <lb/>
            sion for his youth and beauty, during their intercourse, and bade <lb/>
            him escape from the danger. He however reported the matter <lb/>
            to the magistrates, and the treachery being thus made public, <lb/>
            all the Ligurians were seized, those concealed being dragged <lb/>
            from among their baskets; and when they were all put to death, <lb/>
            a plot was formed to surprise the plotter, and seven thousand <lb/>
            of the enemy, with the king himself, were slain. Since that <lb/>
            time the Massilians, on festal days, have been accustomed to <lb/>
            shut their gates, to keep watch, to place sentinels on the walls, <lb/>
            to examine strangers, to take all kinds of precaution, and to <lb/>
            guard the city as carefully in time of peace as if they were at <lb/>
            war. Thus what was wisely instituted, is still observed, not <lb/>
            from the necessity of circumstances, but from the habit of <lb/>
            acting prudently.</p>
          <p>V. Subsequently they had great wars with the Ligurians <lb/>
            and Gauls, which increased the fame of their city, and ren <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> B.C. 386.] </note> <lb/>
            renowned among their neighbours. The forces of the Carthagi­ <lb/>
            nians,* too, in a war which rose between them about the capture <lb/>
            of some fishing boats, they often routed, and granted them peace <lb/>
            under defeat; with the Spaniards they made an alliance ; with <lb/>
            the Romans they faithfully observed the league concluded al­ <lb/>
            most at the foundation of the city, and effectively supported <lb/>
            their allies, in all their wars, with auxiliary troops. Such con <lb/>
            duct both increased their confidence in their own strength, and <lb/>
            secured them peace from their enemies. But after a time, <lb/>
            when Marseilles was at the height of distinction, as well for <lb/>
            the fame of its exploits as for the abundance of its wealth and its <lb/>
            reputation for strength, the neighbouring people, on a sudden, <lb/>
            conspired to destroy the very name of Marseilles, as they would <lb/>
            have united to put out a fire that threatened them all. Catu­ <lb/>
            mandus, one of their petty princes, was unanimously chosen <lb/>
            general, who, when he was besieging the enemy's city with a <lb/>
            vast army of select troops, was frightened in his sleep by the <lb/>
            vision of a stern-looking woman, who told him that she was a <lb/>
            goddess, and of his own accord made peace with the Massilians. <lb/>
            Having then asked permission to enter their city and pay <lb/>
            adoration to their gods, and having gone into the temple of <lb/>
            Minerva, and observed in the portico the statue of the goddess <lb/>
            whom he had seen in his sleep, he suddenly exclaimed that <lb/>
            it was she who had frightened him in the night; that it was <lb/>
            she who had ordered him to raise the siege ;” then, congratu­ <lb/>
            lating the Massilians that they were under the care, as he <lb/>
            perceived, of the immortal gods, and offering a neck-lace of <lb/>
            gold to the goddess, he made a league with them for ever.</p>
          <p>After peace was thus obtained, and security established, <lb/>
            some deputies from Marseilles, as they were returning from <lb/>
            Delphi, whither they had been sent to carry presents to <lb/>
            Apollo, heard that the city of Rome had been taken and <lb/>
            burned by the Gauls. This calamity, when the news of it <lb/>
            was brought home to them, the Massilians lamented with a <lb/>
            public mourning, and contributed gold and silver, both public <lb/>
            and private, to make up the sum to be given to the Gauls, <lb/>
            from whom they knew that peace was bought. For this <lb/>
            service an exemption from taxes was decreed them, a place in <note type="footnote"> * Thucyd. i. 13: "The Phocæans, who founded Marseilles, con­ <lb/>

            and the Pyrenees. It is less than either of these countries, <lb/>
            but more fruitful than either; for it is neither scorched, like <lb/>
            Africa, by a burning sun, nor disturbed, like Gaul,§ by <lb/>
            incessant winds, but, being situate betwixt both, it is rendered, <lb/>
            by moderate heat on the one hand, and genial and seasonable <lb/>

            inhabitants, but for Italy and the city of Rome. From hence, <lb/>
            indeed, comes not only great plenty of corn, but of wine, honey, <lb/>
            and oil. Its iron is excellent, and its breed of horses swift. <lb/>
            Not only is the produce of the surface to be admired, but the <lb/>
            abundant riches of the metals hidden beneath it. There is <lb/>
            great plenty, too, of flax and hemp, and certainly no country is <lb/>

            almost square, except that it grows narrower towards the <lb/>
            Pyrenees, the shores contracting in that quarter. The length <lb/>
            of the Pyrenees is six hundred miles. The salubrity of the <lb/>
            air is the same through the whole of Spain, for its atmosphere <lb/>
            is infected with no unwholesome mists from fens. Besides, <lb/>
            there are constant breezes from the sea on every side, by which, <lb/>
            as they penetrate the whole country, the exhalations from the <lb/>
            earth are dispersed, and the greatest health is secured to the <lb/>
            inhabitants.</p>
          <p>II. The bodies of the inhabitants are well adapted to endure <lb/>
            privation and fatigue; their minds are inured to contempt of <lb/>
            death. A strict and parsimonious abstinence prevails among <lb/>
            them all. They prefer war to peace; and, if no foreign enemy. <lb/>
            offers himself, they seek one at home. Many have died under <lb/>
            torture, to conceal what has been entrusted to them; so much <lb/>
            stronger is their love of honour than of life. The patience of <lb/>
            a slave, too, is greatly praised, who, having avenged his <note type="footnote"> * In paludibus.] Berneccerus, Vorstius, Grævius, and Faber, are <lb/>
            unanimous in preferring in balucibus, which is a correction of Sal­ <lb/>

            seems to require that word rather than the other. It may be doubted, <lb/>
            indeed, whether in balucibus vehunt can be regarded as Latin. For in <lb/>
            balucibus substitute in minutis particulis : would Justin, or any other <lb/>

            master in the war with the Carthaginians, exulted with smiles <lb/>
            in the midst of tortures, and defied, with serenity and cheer­ <lb/>
            fulness, the utmost cruelty of his tormentors. The activity of <lb/>
            the people is extraordinary; their minds restless. To many, <lb/>
            their war-horses and arms are dearer than their blood. There <lb/>
            is no sumptuous preparation among them for festival days; nor <lb/>
            was it till after the second Punic war that they learned from <lb/>
            the Romans to use warm baths.</p>
          <p>During so long a course of years they have had no great <lb/>
            general besides Viriatus,* who maintained a struggle against <lb/>
            the Romans for ten years with various success; so much more <lb/>
            similar are their dispositions to those of wild beasts than of <lb/>
            men; and this very leader they followed, not as having been <lb/>
            chosen by the judgment of the people, but as being well <lb/>
            qualified to take precautions against the enemy, and artful in <lb/>
            avoiding danger. His temperance and moderation were such, <lb/>
            that though he often defeated armies commanded by consuls, <lb/>
            yet, after such achievements, he made no change in the fashion <lb/>
            of his dress or arms, or in his diet, but adhered to the same <lb/>
            way of life with which he commenced his military career; so <lb/>
            that any one of the common soldiers seemed better off than the <lb/>
            general himself.</p>
          <p>III. In Lusitania, near the river Tagus, many authors have <lb/>
            said that the mares conceive from the effect of the wind; but <lb/>
            such stories have had their origin in the fecundity of the mares, <lb/>
            and the vast number of herds of horses, which are so numerous, <lb/>
            and of such swiftness, in Gallæcia and Lusitania, that they <lb/>
            may be thought, not without reason, to have been the offspring <lb/>
            of the wind. As for the Gallæcians, they claim for themselves <lb/>
            a Greek origin; for they say that Teucer, after the end of the <lb/>
            Trojan war, having incurred the hatred of his father on <lb/>
            account of the death of his brother Ajax, and not being <lb/>
            admitted into his kingdom, retired to Cyprus, where he built a <lb/>
            city called Salamis, from the name of his native land; that, <lb/>
            some time after, on hearing a report of his father's death, he <lb/>
            returned again to his country, but, being hindered from <lb/>
            landing by Eurysaces the son of Ajax, he sailed to the coast of <lb/>
            Spain, and took possession of those parts where New Carthage <lb/>
            now stands, and, passing from thence to Gallæcia, and <note type="footnote"> * See Flor. it 17; Veil. Pat. ii. 1, 90; Aurel. Vict. 71; Di<unclear>d</unclear>. Sic. <lb/>

            fixing his abode there, gave name to the nation. A part of <lb/>
            the Gallaecians are called Amphilochi. The country produces <lb/>
            abundance of brass and lead, as well as of vermilion,. which <lb/>
            has given name to a river near the part in which it is found. <lb/>
            It is also very rich in gold, so that they sometimes turn up <lb/>
            clods of gold † with the plough. In the territory of this <lb/>
            people there is a sacred mountain, which it is thought impious <lb/>
            to open with any tool of iron, but whenever the earth is rent <lb/>
            with lightning, an occurrence common in these parts, it is <lb/>
            allowable to pick up the gold that may be laid open, as a gift <lb/>
            from the deity of the place. The women manage household <lb/>
            affairs, and the culture of the ground; the men attend only to <lb/>
            arms, and the pursuit of spoil. Their iron is of an extra­ <lb/>
            ordinary quality, but their water is more powerful than the <lb/>
            iron itself; for the iron, by being tempered in it, becomes <lb/>
            keener; nor is any weapon held in esteem among them which <lb/>
            has not been dipped either in the Bilbilis or the Chalybs.‡ From <lb/>
            the latter river those who dwell on its banks are called <lb/>
            Chalybes, and are said to surpass the rest of the people in the <lb/>
            manufacture of steel.</p>
          <p>IV. The forests of the Tartesians, in which it is said that <lb/>
            the Titans § waged war against the gods, the Cunetes || <lb/>
            inhabited, whose most ancient king Gargoris, was the first to <lb/>
            collect honey. This prince, having a grandson born to him, <lb/>
            the offspring of an intrigue on the part of his daughter, tried <lb/>
            various means, through shame for her unchastity, to have the <lb/>
            child put to death; but he, being preserved by some good <lb/>
            fortune, through all calamities, came at last to the throne, from <lb/>
            a compassionate feeling for the many perils that he had under­ <lb/>
            gone. First of all he ordered him to be exposed, that he <lb/>
            might be starved, and, when he sent some days after to look <lb/>
            for his body, he was found nursed by the milk of various wild <lb/>
            beasts. When he was brought home, he caused him to be <note type="footnote"> * Minio ] Hence the name of the river Minho. </note><note type="footnote"> t Glebas aureas.] Pliny makes the same statement, H.

            thrown down in a narrow road, along which herds of cattle used <lb/>
            to pass ; being so cruel that he would rather have his grand­ <lb/>
            child trampled to pieces, than despatched by an easy death. <lb/>
            As he was unhurt also in this case, and required no food, he <lb/>
            threw him to hungry dogs, that had been exasperated by want <lb/>
            of food for several days, and afterwards to swine, but as he was <lb/>
            not only uninjured, but even fed with the teats of some of the <lb/>
            swine, he ordered him at last to be cast into the sea. On this <lb/>
            occasion, as if, by the manifest interposition of some deity, he <lb/>
            had been carried, amidst the raging tide, and flux and reflux of <lb/>
            the waters, not on the billows but in a vessel, he was put on <lb/>
            shore by the subsiding ocean ; and, not long after, a hind came <lb/>
            up, and offered the child her teats. By constantly following <lb/>
            this nurse, the boy acquired extraordinary swiftness of foot, and <lb/>
            long ranged the mountains and woods among herds of deer, <lb/>
            with fleetness not inferior to theirs. At last, being caught in <lb/>
            a snare, he was presented to the king; and then, from the <lb/>
            similitude of his features, and certain marks which had been <lb/>
            burnt on his body in his infancy, he was recognized as his <lb/>
            grandson. Afterwards, from admiration at his escapes from so <lb/>
            many mischances and perils, he was appointed by his grand­ <lb/>
            father to succeed him on the throne. The name given him <lb/>
            was Habis; and, as soon as he became king, he gave such <lb/>
            proofs of greatness, that he seemed not to have been delivered <lb/>
            in vain, through the power of the gods, from so many exposures <lb/>
            to death. He united the barbarous people by laws; he was the <lb/>
            first that taught them to break oxen for the plough, and to <lb/>
            raise corn from tillage; and he obliged them, instead of food <lb/>
            procured from the wilds, to adopt a better diet, perhaps through <lb/>
            dislike of what he had eaten in his childhood. The adventures <lb/>
            of this prince might seem fabulous, were not the founders of <lb/>
            Rome said to have been suckled by a wolf, and Cyrus, king of <lb/>
            the Persians, to have been brought up by a dog. By him the <lb/>
            people were interdicted from servile duties, and the commonalty <lb/>
            were divided among seven cities. After Habis was dead, the <lb/>
            sovereignty was retained for many generations by his suc­ <lb/>
            cessors.</p>
          <p>In another part of Spain, which consists of islands,. the <note type="footnote"> * Quœ ex insulis constat ] Wetzel thinks that Justin supposed <lb/>
            Geryon to have lived in the Balearic isles. How then did Hercules <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="B.C. 237—220."/> <lb/>
            supreme power was in the hands of Geryon. Here there is <lb/>
            such abundance of food for cattle, that unless the feeding of <lb/>
            the animals were occasionally interrupted, they would burst. <lb/>
            Hence the herds of Geryon, which in those days were accounted <lb/>
            the only species of wealth, were so renowned, that they <lb/>
            tempted Hercules out of Asia by the greatness of such a prize. <lb/>
            Geryon himself, too, they say, was not a man with three <lb/>
            bodies, as is told in fables, but that there were three brothers <lb/>
            living in such unanimity, that they seemed all actuated by one <lb/>
            soul ; and that they did not attack Hercules of their own <lb/>
            accord, but, seeing their herds driven off, endeavoured to <lb/>
            recover what they had lost by force of arms.</p>
          <p>V. After the rule of kings was at an end, the Carthaginians <lb/>
            were the first that made themselves masters of the country; <lb/>
            for when the Gaditani, according to directions which they re­ <lb/>
            ceived in a dream, had removed the sacred things of Hercules <lb/>
            from Tyre, whence also the Carthaginians had their origin, <lb/>
            into Spain, and had built a city there, the neighbouring people <lb/>
            of the country, being jealous of the rise of this new city, and <lb/>
            in consequence attacking the Gaditani in war, the Cartha­ <lb/>
            ginians sent them succour as being their kindred. The expe­ <lb/>
            dition being successful, they both secured the Gaditani from <lb/>
            injury, and added the greatest part of the province to their <lb/>
            own dominions. Subsequently, too, the success of their first <lb/>
            attempt encouraging them, they sent their general Hamilcar, <lb/>
            with a large army, to take possession of the whole country, <lb/>
            who, having performed great exploits, but pursuing his fortune <lb/>
            too rashly, was drawn into an ambush and killed. In his <lb/>
            stead was sent his son-in-law Hasdrubal, who was also killed <lb/>
            by the slave of a certain Spaniard, to avenge the unjust death <lb/>
            of his master. Hannibal, the son of Hamilcar, succeeded <lb/>
            him, a greater general than either of them; for, surpassing the <lb/>
            achievements of both, he subdued the whole of Spain, and <lb/>
            then, making war upon the Romans, he harassed Italy for <lb/>
            sixteen years with various calamities, during which the <lb/>
            Romans, sending the Scipios into Spain, first drove the Car­ <lb/>
            thaginians out of the province, and afterwards carried on <lb/>
            terrible wars with the Spaniards themselves. Nor would <lb/>
            the Spaniards submit to the yoke, even after their country was <note type="footnote"> fabulous, and Justin was wrong in imagining that any part of Spain <lb/>

            not said with reference to that period in the history of Sparta when it <lb/>
            adhered to the laws of Lycurgus, under which it was not allowed to <lb/>
            witness either comedy or tragedy, as Plutarch in his Instituta Laconica <lb/>
            shows, but to the time when the ancient discipline and austerity were <lb/>
            trodden under foot, and the state sunk into luxury and effeminacy; a <lb/>
            condition of things which took place under Leonidas and Agis, and <lb/>
            chiefly, indeed, through the licentiousness of the women, if we may <lb/>
            credit what Plutarch says in his life of Agis. From the earliest times, <lb/>
            however, according to Aristotle, Polit. ii. 9, the Spartan women were <lb/>
            inclined to live very intemperately and luxuriously, and Lycurgus <lb/>
            endeavoured to subject them to laws, but was obliged to desist, through <lb/>
            the opposition which they made. Hence Plato, also, de Legg. lib. ii., <lb/>
            alludes to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂνεσς</foreign>, laxity, of the Spartan women. — Buchner. But <lb/>
            with all such explanations the passage is still difficult and unsatis­ <lb/>
            factory. Why is a widow particularly specified ? No passage in any <lb/>
            ancient author has been found to support this observation of Nepos, if <lb/>
            it be his. What Aristotle says in disparagement of the Lacedæmonian <lb/>
            women is pretty well refuted, as Van Staveren observes, by Plutarch <lb/>
            in his life of Lycurgus, c. 14. Besides, there were no female actors <lb/>
            among the Greeks. For ad scenam, Freinshemius (apud Bœcler. ad <lb/>
            h. 1.) proposes to read ad cœnam, which Gesner approves; Heusinger <lb/>
            conjectures ad lenam. The conjecture of Withof ad encœnia, compared <lb/>
            with Hor. A. P. 232, Festis matrona moveri jussa diebus, might appear <lb/>
            in some degree plausible, were not <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐγκ</foreign>a<foreign xml:lang="grc">ίνι</foreign>a a word resting on scarcely <lb/>
            any other authority than that of the Septuagint and ecclesiastical <lb/>
            writers; for though it occurs in Quintilian, vii. 2, the passage is <lb/>
            scarcely intelligible, and the reading has generally been thought <lb/>
            unsound Goerenz, ad Cic. de Fin. ii. 20, would read quœ non ad <lb/>
            cœnameat mercede condictam, i. e. to a supper or banquet furnished by <lb/>
            a general contribution of the guests. But none of these critics cite <lb/>
            any authority in support of their emendations. As to the last, it <lb/>
            would be casting no dishonour upon a noble widow to say that she <lb/>
            went to a ccena condicta, for such caena might be among those of her <lb/>
            own class. Nor is the applicability of mercede in such a phrase quite <lb/>
            certain. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ In scenam prodire et popuio esse spectaculo, &amp;c ] Actors are here <lb/>

          <p>I. AT the time when Miltiades, the son of Cimon, an Athe­ <lb/>
            nian, was eminent above all his countrymen, both for the <lb/>
            antiquity of his family, the glory of his forefathers, and his <lb/>
            own good conduct,* and was of such an age that his fellow citi­ <lb/>
            zens might not only hope well of him, but assure themselves that <lb/>
            he would bo such as they found him when he became known, <lb/>
            it chanced that the Athenians wished to send colonists to the <lb/>
            Chersonese.t The number of the party being great, and many <lb/>
            applying for a share in the expedition, some chosen from among <lb/>
            them were sent to Delphi,‡ to consult Apollo what leader they <lb/>
            should take in preference to any other; for the Thracians at <lb/>
            the time had possession of those parts, with whom they would <lb/>
            be obliged to contend in war. The Pythia expressly directed <lb/>
            them, when they put the question, to take Miltiades as their <note type="footnote"> * Modestia.] " Good conduct," or " prudence," or " knowledge how <lb/>
            to act," seems to be the true sense of the word. “ Itaque, ut eandem <lb/>

            author, in this biography, confounds Miltiades, the son of Cimon, with <lb/>
            Miltiades the elder, the son of Cypselus. It was the latter who settled <lb/>
            the colony in the Thracian Chersonese, and left the sovereignty of it <lb/>
            at his death to Stesagoras, the son of his half-brother Cimon, and <lb/>
            brother to Miltiades the younger, who became governor of it on the <lb/>
            death of Stesagoras, being sent out by Pisistratus for that purpose. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Ex his delecti Delphos deliberatum mini sunt, qui consulerent Apolli­ <lb/>

            commander, as, if they did so, their undertakings would be <lb/>
            successful. Upon this answer from the oracle, Miltiades set out <lb/>
            for the Chersonese with a fleet, accompanied by a chosen body <lb/>
            01 men,t and touched at Lemnos, when, wishing to reduce <lb/>
            the people of the island under the power of the Athenians, and <lb/>
            requesting the Lemnians to surrender of their own accord. <lb/>
            they, in mockery, replied that “ they would do so, whenever <lb/>
            he, leaving home with a fleet, should reach Lemnos by the aid <lb/>
            of the wind Aquilo; " for this wind, rising from the north, is <lb/>
            contrary to those setting out from Athens. Miltiades, having <lb/>
            no time for delay, directed his course to the quarter to which <lb/>
            he was bound, and arrived at the Chersonese.</p>
          <p>II. Having there, in a short time, scattered the forces of <lb/>
            the barbarians, and made himself master of all the territory <lb/>
            that he had desired, he strengthened suitable places with <lb/>
            fortresses, * settled the multitude, which he had brought with <lb/>
            him, in the country, and enriched them by frequent excursions. <lb/>
            Nor was he less aided, in this proceeding, by good conduct <lb/>
            than by good fortune, for after he had, by the valour of his <lb/>
            men, routed the troops of the enemy, he settled affairs with <lb/>
            the greatest equity, and resolved upon residing in the country <lb/>
            himself. He held, indeed, among the inhabitants, the authority <lb/>
            of a king, though he wanted the name ; and he did not <lb/>
            attain this influence more by his power than by his justice. <lb/>
            Nor did he the less, on this account, perform his duty to the <lb/>
            Athenians, from whom he had come. From these circum­ <lb/>
            stances it happened that he held his office in perpetuity, not <lb/>
            less with the consent of those who had sent him, than of those <lb/>
            with whom he had gone thither.</p>
          <p>Having settled the affairs of the Chersonese in this man­ <lb/>
            ner, he returned to Lemnos, and called on the people to deliver <lb/>
            up their city to him according to their promise ; for they had <lb/>
            said that when he, starting from home, should reach their <lb/>
            country by the aid of the north wind, they would surrender <lb/>
            themselves ; “ and he had now a home, " he told them, " in <lb/>
            the Chersonese." The Carians, who then inhabited Lemnos, <note type="footnote"> * Cum delectâmanu ] A body independent of those who were goiug <lb/>

            though the event had fallen out contrary to their expectation, <lb/>
            yet being influenced, not by the words, but by the good fortune <lb/>
            of their adversaries, did not venture to resist, but withdrew out <lb/>
            of the island. With like success he reduced some other islands, <lb/>
            which are called the Cyclades, under the power of the <lb/>
            Athenians.</p>
          <p>III. About the same period, Darius, king of Persia, <lb/>
            resolved upon transporting his army from Asia into Europe, <lb/>
            and making war upon the Scythians. He constructed a bridge <lb/>
            over the river Ister, by which he might lead across his forces. <lb/>
            Of this bridge he left as guardians, during his absence, ∗ the <lb/>
            chiefs! whom he had brought with him from Ionia and Æolia, <lb/>
            and to whom he had given the sovereignty of their respective <lb/>
            cities; for he thought that he should most easily keep under <lb/>
            his power such of the inhabitants of Asia as spoke Greek, if he <lb/>
            gave their towns to be held by his friends, to whom, if he should <lb/>
            be crushed, ‡ no hope of safety would be left. Among the <lb/>
            number of those, to whom the care of the bridge was then en­ <lb/>
            trusted, was Miltiades.</p>
          <p>As several messengers brought word that Darius was <lb/>
            unsuccessful in his enterprise, and was hard pressed by the <lb/>
            Scythians, Miltiades, in consequence, exhorted the guardians <lb/>
            of the bridge not to lose an opportunity, presented them by <lb/>
            by fortune, of securing the liberty of Greece; for if Darius <lb/>
            should be destroyed, together with the army that he had taken <lb/>
            with him, not only Europe would be safe, but also those who, <lb/>
            being Greeks by birth, inhabited Asia, would be freed from the <lb/>
            dominion of the Persians, and from all danger. " This," he said, <lb/>
            “ might easily be accomplished, for, if the bridge were broken <lb/>
            down, the king would perish in a few days, either by the sword of <lb/>
            the enemy, or by famine." After most of them had assented <lb/>
            to this proposal, Histiæus of Miletus, prevented the design from <lb/>
            being executed; saying that "the same course would not be ex­ <lb/>
            pedient for those who held sovereign command, as for the multi­ <lb/>
            tude, since their authority depended on the power of Darius, and, <note type="footnote"> * Dum ipse abesset ] He fixed, according to Herodotus, a term of <lb/>
            sixty days for his absence, on the expiration of which the guardians of <lb/>
            the bridge might depart. </note><note type="footnote"> t Principes.] The tyrants or sovereigns of the Greek cities, who <lb/>

            consequently overthrown, they would be left without a protector. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="311"/>
            if he were cut off, they would be deprived of their governments, <lb/>
            and suffer punishment at the hands of their subjects ;* and that <lb/>
            he himself, therefore, was so far from agreeing in opinion with <lb/>
            the rest, that he thought nothing more advantageous for them <lb/>
            than that the kingdom of the Persians should be upheld." <lb/>
            As most went over to this opinion, Miltiades, not doubting that <lb/>
            his proposal, since so many were acquainted with it, would <lb/>
            come to the ears of the king, quitted the Chersonese, and went <lb/>
            again to reside at Athens. His suggestion, though it did not <lb/>
            take effect, is yet highly to be commended, as he showed him­ <lb/>
            self a greater friend to the general liberty than to his own <lb/>
            power.</p>
          <p>IV. Darius, when he had returned from Asia into Europe, <lb/>
            prepared, at the exhortation of his friends, in order to reduce <lb/>
            Greece under his dominion, a fleet of five hundred ships, and <lb/>
            appointed Datis and Artaphernes to the command of it, to <lb/>
            whom he assigned two hundred thousand infantry and ten <lb/>
            thousand cavalry; alleging as a reason for his enterprise, <lb/>
            that he was an enemy to the Athenians, because, with their <lb/>
            aid, the Ionians had stormed Sardis † and put his garri­ <lb/>
            son to death. These generals of the king, having brought up <lb/>
            their fleet to Eubœa, soon took Eretria, carried off all the <lb/>
            citizens of the place,‡ and sent them into Asia to the king. <lb/>
            They then went to Attica, and drew up their forces in the <lb/>
            plain of Marathon, which is distant from the city of Athens <lb/>
            about ten miles. The Athenians, though alarmed at this <lb/>
            sudden descent, so near and so menacing, sought assistance <lb/>
            nowhere but from the Spartans, and despatched Phidippides, <lb/>
            a courier of the class called hemerodromoi,§ to Lacedæmon, to <lb/>
            acquaint them how speedy assistance they needed. At home, <note type="footnote"> * Civibus suis penas daturos.] They would be called to account for <lb/>
            having made themselves tyrants. </note><note type="footnote"> t The Ionians had rebelled against Persia, to which they had been <lb/>

            This is alleged among the frivolous reasons for the Persian war. See <lb/>

            meanwhile, they appointed ten captains to command the army, <lb/>
            and among them Miltiades.</p>
          <p>Among these captains there was a great discussion, whether <lb/>
            they should defend themselves within the walls, or march out <lb/>
            to meet the enemy, and decide the contest in the field. Mil­ <lb/>
            tiades was the only one extremely urgent that a camp should <lb/>
            be formed as soon as possible; “ for,”he said, "if that were <lb/>
            done, not only would courage be added to their countrymen, <lb/>
            when they saw that there was no distrust of their valour, but <lb/>
            the enemy, from the same cause, would be less bold, if they <lb/>
            saw that the Athenians would venture to oppose them with so <lb/>
            small a force."</p>
          <p>V. In this crisis no state gave assistance to the Athenians, <lb/>
            except that of Platæa, which sent them a thousand men. On <lb/>
            the arrival of these, the number of ten thousand armed men <lb/>
            was made up ; a band which was animated with an extraor­ <lb/>
            dinary ardour to fight. Hence it happened that Miltiades had <lb/>
            more influence than his colleagues, for the Athenians, incited <lb/>
            by his authority, led out their forces from the city, and pitched <lb/>
            their camp in an eligible place. The next day, having set <lb/>
            themselves in array at the foot of the hills opposite the enemy, <lb/>
            they engaged in battle with a novel stratagem, and with the <lb/>
            utmost impetuosity. For trees had been strewed in many <lb/>
            directions, with this intention, that, while they themselves <lb/>
            were covered by the high hills,. the enemy's cavalry might be <lb/>
            impeded by the spread of trees, so that they might not be sur­ <lb/>
            rounded by numbers. Datis, though he saw that the ground <lb/>
            was unfavourable for his men, yet, depending on the number <lb/>
            of his force, was desirous to engage, and the rather, because <lb/>
            he thought it of advantage to fight before the Spartans came <lb/>
            to the enemy's assistance. He led into the field, therefore, a <lb/>
            hundred thousand foot and ten thousand horse, and proceeded <lb/>
            to battle. In the encounter the Athenians, through their <lb/>
            valour, had so much the advantage, that they routed ten times <lb/>
            the number 01 the enemy, and threw them into such a conster­ <lb/>
            nation, that the Persians betook themselves, not to their camp, <lb/>
            but to their ships. Than this battle there has hitherto been <lb/>
            none more glorious; for never did so small a band overthrow <lb/>
            so numerous a host. <note type="footnote"> * The text is here in an unsatisfactory state, as all the <unclear>critics</unclear> <lb/>

          <p>VI. For this victory it does not seem improper to state <lb/>
            what reward was conferred on Miltiades, that it may be the <lb/>
            more easily understood that the nature of all states is the <lb/>
            same; for as honours among our own people were once few <lb/>
            and inexpensive, and for that reason highly prized, but are <lb/>
            now costly and common, so we find that it formerly was <lb/>
            among the Athenians. For to this very Miltiades, who had <lb/>
            saved Athens and the whole of Greece, such honour only <lb/>
            was granted, that when the battle of Marathon was painted in <lb/>
            the portico called Pœcile,∗ his figure was placed first in the <lb/>
            number of the ten commanders, and he was represented as en­ <lb/>
            couraging his men, and commencing the battle. The same <lb/>
            people, after they acquired greater power, and were corrupted <lb/>
            by the largesses of their rulers, decreed three hundred statues <lb/>
            to Demetrius Phalereus.</p>
          <p>VII. After this battle the Athenians gave Miltiades a fleet <lb/>
            of seventy ships, that he might make war on the islands that <lb/>
            had assisted the barbarians. In the discharge of this com­ <lb/>
            mission he obliged most of them to return to their duty; t <lb/>
            some he took by assault. Being unable to gain over by per­ <lb/>
            suasion one of their number, the island of Pares, which was <lb/>
            vain of its strength, he drew his troops out of his ships, <lb/>
            invested the town,‡ and cut off all their supplies; soon after, <lb/>
            he erected his vineœ§ and tortoises, and came close up to the <lb/>
            walls. When he was on the point of taking the town, a grove <lb/>
            on the main land, which was some distance off, but visible <lb/>
            from the island, was set on fire, by I know not what accident, <lb/>
            in the night; and when the flame of it was seen by the towns­ <lb/>
            men and besiegers, it was imagined by both that it was a <lb/>
            signal given by the men of the king's fleet; whence it hap­ <lb/>
            pened that both the Parians were deterred || from surrendering, <lb/>
            and Miltiades, fearing that the royal fleet was approaching, <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">ΙΙοικιλη Στοά</foreign>, " the painted portico,” as being adorned with <lb/>

            set fire to the works which he had erected, and returned to <lb/>
            Athens with the same number of ships with which he had set <lb/>
            out, to the great displeasure of his countrymen. He was in <lb/>
            consequence accused of treason, on the allegation, that " when <lb/>
            he might have taken Pares, he desisted from the siege, <lb/>
            without effecting anything, through being bribed by the king <lb/>
            of Persia." He was at this time ill of the wounds which he <lb/>
            had received in besieging the town, and, as he could not plead <lb/>
            for himself, his brother Tisagoras spoke for him. The cause <lb/>
            being heard, he was not condemned to death, but sentenced <lb/>
            to pay a fine, which was fixed at fifty talents, a sum equivalent <lb/>
            to that which had been spent on the fleet. As he could not <lb/>
            pay this money, he was thrown into prison, and there ended <lb/>
            his life.</p>
          <p>VIII. Although he was brought to trial on the charge <lb/>
            relating to Pares, yet there was another cause for his con­ <lb/>
            demnation ; for the Athenians, in consequence of the tyranny or <lb/>
            Pisistratus, which had occurred a few years before, looked with <lb/>
            dread on the aggrandizement of any one of their citizens. <lb/>
            Miltiades having been much engaged in military and civil of­ <lb/>
            fices, was not thought likely to be contented in a private station, <lb/>
            especially as he might seem to be drawn by the force of habit <lb/>
            to long for power; for he had held uninterrupted sovereignty <lb/>
            in the Chersonesus during all the years that he had dwelt <lb/>
            there, and had been called a tyrant, though a just one; for he <lb/>
            had not acquired his power by violence, but by the consent of <lb/>
            his countrymen, and had maintained his authority by the <lb/>
            uprightness of his conduct. But all are esteemed and called <lb/>
            tyrants, who become possessed of permanent power in any <lb/>
            state which had previously enjoyed liberty. In Miltiades, <lb/>
            however, there was both the greatest philanthropy and a won­ <lb/>
            derful affability, so that there was no person so humble as not <lb/>
            to have free access to him; he had also the greatest influence <lb/>
            among all the states of Greece, with a noble name, and repu­ <lb/>
            tation for military achievements. The people, looking to these <lb/>
            circumstances, chose rather that he should suffer, though inno <lb/>
            cent, than that they should continue longer in fear of him.</p><pb n="315"/>

          <p>I. THEMISTOCLES was the son of Neocles, an Athenian. <lb/>
            The vices of his early youth were compensated by great vir­ <lb/>
            tues, so that no one is thought superior, and few are considered <lb/>
            equal to him.</p>
          <p>But we must begin from the beginning. His father <lb/>
            Neocles was of a good family, and married a native of <lb/>
            Acharnæ,∗ of whom Themistocles was the son. Falling under <lb/>
            the displeasure of his parents, because he lived too freely, and <lb/>
            took no care of his property, he was disinherited by his father. <lb/>
            This disgrace, however, did not dishearten him, but incited <lb/>
            him to exertion, for being aware that it could not be ob­ <lb/>
            literated without the utmost efforts on his part, he devoted <lb/>
            himself wholly to affairs of state, studying diligently to benefit <lb/>
            his friends as well as his own reputation. He was much <lb/>
            engaged in private causes, and appeared often before the <lb/>
            assembly of the people; no matter of importance was managed <lb/>
            without him; he quickly discovered what was necessary to be <lb/>
            done, and readily explained it in his speeches. Nor was he <lb/>
            less ready in managing business than in devising plans for it, <lb/>
            for, as Thucydides says, he formed a most accurate judgment <lb/>
            of present affairs, and the shrewdest conjectures as to the <lb/>
            future. Hence it happened that he soon became distinguished. <note type="footnote"> * Acharnanam civem.] This is the reading of most, if not all, of the <lb/>
            MSS., and Bos retains it. " Aldus," says Bos, “ was the first, I think, <lb/>
            to change Acharnanam into Halicarnassiam, from having read in <lb/>
            Plutarch that Neanthes said Halicarnassus in Caria was the birth-place <lb/>
            of Themistocles's mother. For my part, I am unwilling to give up <lb/>
            the old reading, especially as there is so much uncertainty on the <lb/>
            point among writers." Some make Themistocles the son of a Thracian <lb/>
            woman, and called her Abrotonus, some of a Carian, and called her <lb/>
            Euterpe. See Plutarch. Themist. init. and Athenæus, xiii. 5. Acharnæ <lb/>
            was a borough of Attica. Plutarch, however, asserts that Themistocles <lb/>
            was not of pure Attic blood on the mother's side. Nor is there any­ <lb/>
            thing either in him or At henæus to support the reading Acharnanam. </note> <pb n="316"/>
             </p>
          <p>II. His first step in the management of public affairs was <lb/>
            in the Corcyræan war.* Being chosen commander by the <lb/>
            people to conduct it, he increased the confidence of the <lb/>
            citizens, not only as to the struggle in which they were en­ <lb/>
            gaged, but for time to come. As the public money, which <lb/>
            came in from the mines, was annually wasted by the pro­ <lb/>
            fusion† of the magistrates, he prevailed on the people that a <lb/>
            fleet of a hundred ships should be built with that money. <lb/>
            This being soon constructed, he first reduced the Corcyræans, <lb/>
            and then, by vigorously pursuing the pirates, rendered the <lb/>
            sea secure. In acting thus, he both supplied the Athenians <lb/>
            with wealth, and made them extremely skilful in naval war­ <lb/>
            fare. How much this contributed to the safety of Greece in <lb/>
            general, was discovered in the Persian war, when Xerxes <lb/>
            assailed the whole of Europe by sea and land, with such a <lb/>
            force as no man ever had, before or since; for his fleet con <lb/>
            sisted of two hundred ships of war, on which two thousand <lb/>
            transport vessels attended, and his land force was seveu <lb/>
            hundred thousand foot, and four hundred thousand horse.</p>
          <p>When the news of his approach was spread through Greece, <lb/>
            and the Athenians, on account of the battle of Marathon, were <lb/>
            said to be the chief objects of his attack, they sent to Delphi to <lb/>
            ask what they should do in their present circumstances. As <lb/>
            soon as they put the question, the Pythian priestess replied that <lb/>
            “they must defend themselves with wooden walls." As no <lb/>
            one understood to what this answer tended, Themistocles <lb/>
            suggested that it was Apollo's recommendation that they <lb/>
            should put themselves and their property on board their ships, <lb/>
            for that such were the wooden walls intended by the god. This <note type="footnote"> * Bello Corcyrœo.] Rather Æginetico, in the war with Ægina, as <lb/>
            Lambinus and other commentators have observed; for that war <lb/>
            happened about the time to which allusion is here made. See Herod. <lb/>
            vii. 144, and Plutarch. Them. c. 4. But of a war with Corcyra neither <lb/>
            Herodotus nor Thucydides makes any mention; a dispute between the <lb/>
            Corcyræans and Corinthians is noticed by Plutarch, Them. c. 24, which <lb/>
            Themistocles, as arbiter, is said to have settled The passage is there­ <lb/>
            fore corrupt, perhaps from an error of Æmilius Probus, or perhaps <lb/>

            person of full-grown age.— Bos. But the division of it was the act of <lb/>
            the people themselves, though it might be promoted by the influence <lb/>
            of some of the leading men. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="317"/>
            plan being approved, they added to their former vessels as <lb/>
            many more with three banks of oars, and carried off all their <lb/>
            goods that could be moved, partly to Salamis and partly to <lb/>
            Trcezen. The citadel, and sacred things, they committed to <lb/>
            the priests, and a few old men, to be taken care of; the rest <lb/>
            of the town they abandoned.</p>
          <p>III. This measure of Themistocles was unsatisfactory tc <lb/>
            most of the states, and they preferred to fight on land. A <lb/>
            select force was accordingly sent with Leonidas, king of the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians, to secure the pass of Thermopylae, and pre­ <lb/>
            vent the barbarians from advancing further. This body could <lb/>
            not withstand the force of the enemy, and were all slain on <lb/>
            the spot. But the combined fleet of Greece, consisting of <lb/>
            three hundred ships, of which two hundred belonged to the <lb/>
            Athenians, engaged the king's fleet for the first time at <lb/>
            Artemisium, between Eubcea and the main land; for Themis­ <lb/>
            tocles had betaken himself to the straits, that he might not be <lb/>
            surrounded by numbers. Though they came off here with <lb/>
            success equally balanced, yet they did not dare to remain <lb/>
            in the same place, because there was apprehension, lest, if <lb/>
            part of the enemy's fleet should get round Eubœa, they should <lb/>
            be assailed by danger on both sides. Hence it came to past <lb/>
            that they left Artemisium, and drew up their fleet on the coast <lb/>
            of Salamis, over against Athens.</p>
          <p>IV. Xerxes, having forced a passage through Thermopylae <lb/>
            marched at once to the city, and as none defended it, destroyed <lb/>
            it by fire, putting to death the priests that he found in the <lb/>
            citadel. As those on board the fleet, alarmed at the report of <lb/>
            this catastrophe, did not dare to remain where they were, and <lb/>
            most of them gave their opinion that they should return to <lb/>
            their respective homes, and defend themselves within their <lb/>
            walls, Themistocles alone opposed it, saying that united they <lb/>
            would be a match for the enemy, but declaring that if <lb/>
            they separated they would be destroyed. That this would be <lb/>
            the case he assured Eurybiades, king of the Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            who then held the chief command, but making less impression <lb/>
            on him than he wished, he sent one of his slaves, the most <lb/>
            trustworthy that he had, to Xerxes in the night, to tell him <lb/>
            in his own precise words, that “his enemies were retreating, and <lb/>
            that, if they should make off, he would require more labour <lb/>
            and longer time to finish the war, as he would have to pursue <lb/>
             <pb n="318"/>
            those singly, whom, if he attacked them immediately, he might <lb/>
            destroy in a body and at once." The object of this communi­ <lb/>
            cation was, that all the Greeks should be forced to fight even <lb/>
            against their will. The barbarian, receiving this intimation, <lb/>
            and not suspecting any guile to be hidden under it, engaged, <lb/>
            the day after, in a place most unfavourable for himself, and <lb/>
            most advantageous for the enemy, the strait being so confined. <lb/>
            that the body of his fleet could not be brought into action. <lb/>
            He was defeated in consequence rather by the stratagem of <lb/>
            Themistocles than by the arms of Greece.</p>
          <p>V. Though Xerxes had thus mismanaged his affairs, he had <lb/>
            yet so vast a force left, that even with this he might have <lb/>
            overpowered his enemies. But in the meanwhile† he was <lb/>
            driven from his position by the same leader. For Themis­ <lb/>
            tocles, fearing that he would persist in protracting the contest, <lb/>
            Bent him notice that it was in contemplation that the bridge, <lb/>
            which he had made over the Hellespont, should be broken up, <lb/>
            and that he should thus be prevented from returning into <lb/>
            Asia; and he convinced him that such was the fact. In <lb/>
            consequence Xerxes returned into Asia in less than thirty days, <lb/>
            by the same way by which he had spent six months in coming, <lb/>
            and considered himself not conquered, but saved, by Themis­ <lb/>
            tocles. Thus Greece was delivered by the policy of one man, <lb/>
            and Asia succumbed to Europe. This is a second victory <lb/>
            that may be compared with the triumph at Marathon; for the <lb/>
            greatest fleet in the memory of man was conquered in like <lb/>
            manner t at Salamis by a small number of ships</p>
          <p>VI. Themistocles was great in this war, and was not less <lb/>
            distinguished in peace; for as the Athenians used the har­ <lb/>
            bour of Phalerum, which was neither large nor convenient, <lb/>
            the triple port of the Piræus§ was constructed by his advice, <lb/>
            and enclosed with walls, so that it equalled the city in mag­ <lb/>
            nificence, and excelled it in utility. He also rebuilt the walls <note type="footnote"> * Ade<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὸ</foreign> angusto mari.] It was in the strait between the island of <lb/>

            of Athens at his own individual risk , for the Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            having found a fair pretext, in consequence of the inroads of <lb/>
            the barbarians, for saying that no walled town should be kept <lb/>
            up without the Peloponnesus, in order that there might be <lb/>
            no fortified places of which the enemy might take possession, <lb/>
            attempted to prevent the Athenians from building them. <lb/>
            This attempt had a far different object from that which they <lb/>
            wished to be apparent; for the Athenians, by their two <lb/>
            victories at Marathon and Salamis, had gained so much <lb/>
            renown among all people, that the Lacedæmonians became <lb/>
            aware that they should have a struggle with them for the <lb/>
            supremacy. They therefore wished the Athenians to be as <lb/>
            weak as possible.</p>
          <p>After they heard, however, that the erection of the wall was <lb/>
            begun, they sent ambassadors to Athens to prevent it from <lb/>
            being continued. While the ambassadors were present, they <lb/>
            desisted, and said that they would send an embassy to them <lb/>
            respecting the matter. This embassy Themistocles undertook, <lb/>
            and set out first by himself, desiring that the rest of the <lb/>
            ambassadors should follow when the height of the wall should <lb/>
            seem sufficiently advanced ; and that, in the meantime, all <lb/>
            the people, slaves as well as freemen, should carry on the work, <lb/>
            sparing no place, whether sacred or profane, public or private, <lb/>
            but collecting from all quarters whatever they thought suitable <lb/>
            for building. Hence it happened that the walls of the <lb/>
            Athenians were constructed of materials from temples and <lb/>
            tombs.</p>
          <p>VII. Themistocles, when he arrived at Lacedæmon, would <lb/>
            not go to the authorities at once, but endeavoured to make as <lb/>
            much delay as possible, alleging, as a reason, that he was <lb/>
            waiting for his colleagues. While the Lacedæmonians were <lb/>
            complaining that the work was nevertheless continued, and <lb/>
            that he was trying to deceive them in the matter, the rest of <lb/>
            the ambassadors in the meantime arrived; and, as he learned <lb/>
            from them that but little of the wall remained to be done, he <lb/>
            proceeded to the Lacedæmonian Ephori, in whom the supreme <lb/>
            power was vested, and assured them positively that “ false <lb/>
            accounts had been given them," adding that it would be proper <lb/>
            for them to send persons of character and respectability, in <lb/>
            whom trust might be placed, to inquire into the affair; and <lb/>
            that in the meantime they might detain himself as a hostage.' <lb/>
             <pb n="320"/>
            His suggestion was complied with, and three deputies, men <lb/>
            who had filled the highest offices, were despatched to Athens.</p>
          <p>When Themistocles thought that they had reached the city, <lb/>
            he went to the Ephori and senate of the Lacedæmonians, and <lb/>
            boldly stated that “ the Athenians, by his advice, had enclosed <lb/>
            their public gods, and their national and household gods,. with <lb/>
            walls, that they might more easily defend them from the enemy, <lb/>
            a step which they were at liberty to take by the common law of <lb/>
            rations; nor had they, in acting thus, done what was useless to <lb/>
            Greece; for their city stood as a bulwark against the barbarians, <lb/>
            at which the king's fleets had already twice suffered shipwreck; <lb/>
            and that the Lacedæmonians acted unreasonably and unjustly, <lb/>
            in regarding rather what was conducive to their own dominion, <lb/>
            than what would be of advantage to the whole of Greece. <lb/>
            If, therefore, they wished to receive back the deputies whom <lb/>
            they had sent to Athens, they must permit him to return; <lb/>
            otherwise they would never receive them into their country <lb/>
            again."</p>
          <p>VIII. Yet he did not escape jealousy on the part of his own <lb/>
            countrymen ; for being expelled from the city by the ostracism, <lb/>
            through the same apprehension from which Miltiades had <lb/>
            been condemned, he went to dwell at Argos. While he was <lb/>
            living there in great honour, on account of his many excellent <lb/>
            qualities, the Lacedæmonians sent ambassadors to Athens to <lb/>
            accuse him in his absence of having made a league with the <lb/>
            king of Persia to subjugate Greece. On this charge he was <lb/>
            condemned, while absent, of treason to his country. As soon <lb/>
            as he heard of this sentence, he removed, as he did not think <lb/>
            himself safe at Argos, to Corcyra. But perceiving that the <lb/>
            leading men of that state were afraid lest the Lacedæmo <lb/>
            nians and Athenians should declare war against them on his <lb/>
            account, he fled to Admetus, king of the Molossi, with whom <lb/>
            he had had a great friendship.† Having arrived here, and <lb/>
            the king being absent at the time, he, in order that he might <lb/>
            secure himself, if received, with the stronger safeguard of <note type="footnote"> *By public gods, deos publico, are meant the deities worshipped <lb/>

            religion, took up the kings little daughter, and ran with her <lb/>
            into a certain temple, which was regarded with the utmost <lb/>
            veneration, and from which he did not come out till the king, <lb/>
            having given him his right hand, took him under his protec <lb/>
            tion; an engagement which he strictly observed. For when his <lb/>
            surrender was publicly demanded by the Athenians and Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians, he did not betray his dependant, but warned him <lb/>
            to consult for his safety, as it would be difficult for him to live <lb/>
            in security in a place so near to Greece. He in consequence <lb/>
            caused him to be conducted to Pydna, appointing him a <lb/>
            sufficient guard. Here he went on board a ship, to all the <lb/>
            sailors in which he was personally unknown. The vessel <lb/>
            being driven by a violent storm towards Naxos, where the <lb/>
            army of the Athenians then lay, Themistocles felt assured <lb/>
            that, if he put in there, he must lose his life. Being thus <lb/>
            compelled by necessity, he disclosed to the captain of the ship <lb/>
            who he was, promising him a large reward if he would save <lb/>
            him. The captain, moved with concern for so illustrious a <lb/>
            man, kept the ship at anchor in the open sea, at some dis­ <lb/>
            tance from the island, for a day and a night, allowing no <lb/>
            person to quit it. Thence he went to Ephesus, where he <lb/>
            set Themistocles on shore, who afterwards liberally rewarded <lb/>
            him for his services.</p>
          <p>IX. I know most historians have related that Themistocles <lb/>
            went over into Asia in the reign of Xerxes, but I give credence <lb/>
            to Thucydides in preference to others, because he, of all who <lb/>
            have left records of that period, was nearest in point of time <lb/>
            to Themistocles, and was of the same city. Thucydides says <lb/>
            that he went to Artaxerxes, and sent him a letter in these <lb/>
            words: “ I, Themistocles, am come to you, a man, who, of <lb/>
            all the Greeks, brought most evil upon your house, when <lb/>
            I was obliged to war against your father, and to defend my <lb/>
            own country. I also did your father still greater service, <lb/>
            after I myself was in safety, and he began to be in danger ; <lb/>
            for when he wished, after the battle fought at Salamis, to <lb/>
            return into Asia, I informed him by letter that it was in con <lb/>
            templation that the bridge, which he had constructed over the <lb/>
            Hellespont, should be broken up, and that he should be sur­ <lb/>
            rounded by enemies ; by which information he was rescued <lb/>
            from danger. But now, pursued by all Greece, I have fled to <lb/>
            vou, soliciting your favour, and if I shall obtain it, you will <note type="footnote"> Y </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="322"/>
            find me no less deserving as a friend than your father found <lb/>
            me resolute as an enemy. I make this request, however, that <lb/>
            with regard to the subjects on which I wish to discourse with <lb/>
            you, you would grant me a year's delay, and when that time <lb/>
            is past, permit me to approach you."</p>
          <p>X. The king, admiring his greatness of mind, and wishing <lb/>
            to have such a man attached to him, granted his request. <lb/>
            Themistocles devoted all that time to the writings and lan­ <lb/>
            guage of the Persians, in which he acquired such knowledge, <lb/>
            that he is said to have spoken before the king with much more <lb/>
            propriety. than those could who were born in Persia. After he <lb/>
            had made the king many promises, and what was most agree­ <lb/>
            able of them all, that if he would follow his advice, he might <lb/>
            conquer Greece in war, he was honoured with rich presents by <lb/>
            Artaxerxes, and returning into Asia Minor, fixed his habita­ <lb/>
            tion at Magnesia. For the king had bestowed upon him this <lb/>
            city, expressing himself in these words, that “ it was to <lb/>
            supply him with bread;" (from the land about this place fifty <lb/>
            talents came into him annually;) and he had also given him <lb/>
            Lampsacus, “ whence he might get his wine," and Myus, <lb/>
            " from which he might have meats for his table." t</p>
          <p>Two memorials of Themistocles have remained to our times; <lb/>
            his sepulchre near the city,‡ in which he was buried, and his <lb/>
            statues in the forum of Magnesia. Concerning his death <lb/>
            various accounts have been given by several writers; we <lb/>
            prefer, to all others, the authority of Thucydides, who says <lb/>
            that he died of some disease at Magnesia, though he admits <lb/>
            that there was a report that he voluntarily took poison, because <lb/>
            he despaired of being able to perform what he had promised <lb/>
            the king about subjugating Greece. Thucydides has also <lb/>
            recorded that his bones were buried by his friends in Attica <lb/>
            privately, it not being permitted by law to bury them, as he <lb/>
            had been pronounced guilty of treason. <note type="footnote"> * Multo commodius.] This seems impossible. He might have better <lb/>

          <p>I. ARISTIDES, the son of Lysimachus, a native of Athens, <lb/>
            was almost of the same age with Themistocles, and contended <lb/>
            with him, in consequence, for pre-eminence, as they were <lb/>
            determined rivals one to the other ;* and it was seen in their <lb/>
            case how much eloquence could prevail over integrity; for <lb/>
            though Aristides was so distinguished for uprightness of con. <lb/>
            duct,! that he was the only person in the memory of man (as <lb/>
            far at least as I have heard) who was called by the surname of <lb/>
            JUST, yet being overborne by Themistocles with the ostracism, <lb/>
            he was condemned to be banished for ten years.</p>
          <p>Aristides, finding that the excited multitude could not be <lb/>
            appeased, and noticing, as he yielded to their violence, a person <lb/>
            writing that he ought to be banished, is said to have asked him <lb/>
            "why he did so, or what Aristides had done, that he should be <lb/>
            thought deserving of such a punishment? " The person writing <lb/>
            replied, that " he did not know Aristides, but that he was not <lb/>
            pleased that he had laboured to be called Just beyond other <lb/>
            men."</p>
          <p>He did not suffer the full sentence of ten years appointed <lb/>
            by law, for when Xerxes made a descent upon Greece, he was <lb/>

            also commander of the Athenians at Platææ, in the battle in <lb/>
            which Mardonius was routed, and the army of the barbarians <lb/>
            was cut off. Nor is there any other celebrated act of his in <lb/>
            military affairs recorded, besides the account of this command; <lb/>
            but of his justice, equity, and self-control, there are many in <lb/>
            stances. Above all, it was through his integrity, when he was <lb/>
            joined in command of the common fleet of Greece with <lb/>
            Pausanias, under whose leadership Mardonius had been put to <lb/>
            flight, that the supreme authority at sea was transferred from <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians to the Athenians; for before that time <lb/>
            the Lacedaemonians had the command both by sea and land. <lb/>
            But at this period it happened, through the indiscreet conduct <lb/>
            of Pausanias, and the equity of Aristides, that all the states <lb/>
            of Greece attached themselves as allies to the Athenians, and <lb/>
            chose them as their leaders against the barbarians.</p>
          <p>III. -In order that they might repel the barbarians more <lb/>
            easily, if perchance they should try to renew the war, Aristides <lb/>
            was chosen to settle what sum of money each state should con­ <lb/>
            tribute for building fleets and equipping troops. By his ap­ <lb/>
            pointment four hundred and sixty talents were deposited <lb/>
            annually at Delos, which they fixed upon to be the common <lb/>
            treasury; but all this money was afterwards removed to <lb/>
            Athens.</p>
          <p>How great was his integrity, there is no more certain proof, <lb/>
            than that, though he had been at the head of such important <lb/>
            affairs, he died in such poverty that he scarcely left money to <lb/>
            defray the charges of his funeral. Hence it was that his <lb/>
            daughters were brought up at the expense of the country, and <lb/>
            were married with dowries given them from the public treasury. <lb/>
            He died about four years after Themistooles was banished from <lb/>
            Athens. <note type="footnote"> * At the commencement of this chapter I have departed from Bos's <lb/>

          </ab>

            Xerxes, II.—His conduct abroad; his imprisonment, III.—He <lb/>
            betrays his guilt, IV.— His death at the temple of Minerva, V.</p>
          <p>I. PAUSANIAS the Lacedæmonian was a great man; but of <lb/>
            varied character in all the relations of life; for as he was <lb/>
            ennobled by virtues, he was also obscured by vices. His most <lb/>
            famous battle was that at Platææ, for, under his command <lb/>
            Mardonius, a royal satrap, by birth a Mede, and son-in-law tc <lb/>
            the king (a man, among the chief of all the Persians, brave <lb/>
            in action and full of sagacity), at the head of two hundred <lb/>
            thousand infantry, whom he had chosen man by man, and <lb/>
            twenty thousand cavalry, was routed by no very large army of <lb/>
            Greeks; and the general himself was slain in the struggle.</p>
          <p>Elated by this victory, he began to indulge in irregular <lb/>
            proceedings,* and to covet greater power. But he first in­ <lb/>
            curred blame on this account, that he offered at Delphi, out of <lb/>
            the spoil, a golden tripod with an inscription written upon it, <lb/>
            in which was this statement, that " the barbarians had been <lb/>
            cut off at Platææ by his management, and that, on account of <lb/>
            that victory, he had presented this offering to Apollo." These <lb/>
            lines the Lacedæmonians erased, and wrote nothing but the <lb/>
            names of the states by whose aid the Persians had been <lb/>
            conquered.</p>
          <p>II. After this battle they sent Pausanias with the confede­ <lb/>
            rate fleet to Cyprus and the Hellespont, to expel the garrisons <lb/>
            of the barbarians from those parts. Experiencing equal good <lb/>
            fortune in this enterprise, he began to conduct himself still <lb/>
            more haughtily, and to aim at still higher matters ; for having, <lb/>
            at the taking of Byzantium, captured several Persian noble­ <lb/>
            men, and among them some relations of the king, he sent <lb/>
            them secretly back to Xerxes, and pretended that they had <lb/>
            escaped out of prison. He sent with them, also, Gongylus of <lb/>
            Eretria, to carry a letter to the king, in which Thucydides t <lb/>
            has recorded that the following words were written : " Pausa­ <lb/>
            nias, the general of Sparta, having discovered that those whom <note type="footnote"> * Plurima miscere.] To mingle, or t row into confusion, very <unclear>ma­</unclear> <lb/>

            he took at Byzantium are your relations, has sent them back as <lb/>
            a gift, and desires to be joined in affinity with you. If there­ <lb/>
            fore it seem good to you, give him your daughter in marriage. <lb/>
            Should you do so, he engages, with your aid, to bring both <lb/>
            Sparta and the rest of Greece under your sway. If you wish <lb/>
            anything to be done with regard to these proposals, be careful <lb/>
            to send a trustworthy person to him, with whom he may <lb/>
            confer."</p>
          <p>The king, extremely delighted at the restoration of so many <lb/>
            persons so nearly related to him, immediately despatched <lb/>
            Artabazus with a letter to Pausanias, in which he commended <lb/>
            him, and begged that he would spare no pains to accomplish <lb/>
            what he promised; if he effected it, he should never meet <lb/>
            with a refusal of anything from him. Pausanias, learning <lb/>
            what the king's pleasure was, and growing more eager for <lb/>
            the accomplishment of his designs, fell under the suspicion of <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians. In the midst of his proceedings, accord­ <lb/>
            ingly, he was recalled home, and being brought to trial on a <lb/>
            capital charge, was acquitted on it, but sentenced to pay a <lb/>
            fine; for which reason he was not sent back to the fleet.</p>
          <p>III. Not long after, however, he returned to the army of <lb/>
            his own accord, and there, not in a sensible, but in an insane <lb/>
            manner, let his views become known; for he laid aside, not <lb/>
            only the manners of his country, but its fashions and dress. <lb/>
            He adopted regal splendour and Median attire; Median and <lb/>
            Egyptian guards attended him; he had his table served, after <lb/>
            the Persian manner, more luxuriously than those who were <lb/>
            with him could endure; he refused permission to approach <lb/>
            him to those who sought it; he gave haughty replies and <lb/>
            severe commands. To Sparta he would not return, but with­ <lb/>
            drew to Colonæ, a place in the country of Troas, where he <lb/>
            formed designs pernicious both to his country and himself. <lb/>
            When the Lacedæmonians knew of his proceedings, they sent <lb/>
            deputies to him with a scytala. on which it was written, after <lb/>
            their fashion,! that " if he did not return home, they would <note type="footnote"> * Cum scytald.] The scytala was a staff, round which a slip of parch­ <lb/>
            ment being rolled obliquely, the orders of the Ephori were written on <lb/>
            it longitudinally, so that, when unrolled, they could not be read until <lb/>
            the parchment was again rolled round a staff of the same thickness <lb/>
            which the general had with him. </note><note type="footnote"> t More illorum.] That is, with extreme brevity. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="327"/>
            condemn him to death." Being alarmed at this communication, <lb/>
            but hoping that he should be able, by his money and his <lb/>
            influence, to ward off the danger that threatened him, he <lb/>
            returned home. As soon as he arrived there, he was thrown <lb/>
            into the public prison by the Ephori, for it is allowable, by <lb/>
            their laws. for any one of the Ephori to do this to a king.. <lb/>
            He however got himself freed from confinement, but was not <lb/>
            cleared from suspicion, for the belief still prevailed, that he <lb/>
            bad made a compact with the king of Persia.</p>
          <p>There is a certain class of men called Helots, of whom a <lb/>
            great number till the lands of the Lacedæmonians, and per­ <lb/>
            form the duties of slaves. These men he was thought to have <lb/>
            solicited, by holding out to them hopes of liberty, to join him. <lb/>
            But as there was no visible ground for a charge against him <lb/>
            on these points, on which he might be convicted, they did not <lb/>
            think that they ought to pronounce, concerning so eminent <lb/>
            and famous a man, on suspicion only, but that they must wait <lb/>
            till the affair should disclose itself.</p>
          <p>IV. In the meantime a certain Argilian, † a young man <lb/>
            whom, in his boyhood, Pausanias had loved with an ardent <lb/>
            affection.‡ having received a letter from him for Artabazus, <lb/>
            and conceiving a suspicion that there was something written in <lb/>
            it about himself, because no one of those who had been sent <lb/>
            to the same place on such an errand, had returned, loosed the <lb/>
            string of the letter, § and taking off the seal, discovered that if <lb/>
            he delivered it he would lose his life. In the letter were also <lb/>
            some particulars respecting matters that had been arranged <lb/>
            between the king and Pausanias. This letter he delivered to <lb/>
            the Ephori. The cautious prudence of the Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            on this occasion, is not to be passed without notice; for they <lb/>
            were not induced, even by this man's information, to seize <lb/>
            Pausanias, nor did they think that violent measures should be <lb/>
            adopted, until he gave proof of his own guilt. <note type="footnote"> 0 Regi.] Pausanias was not actually a king, but guardian to the <lb/>

            which was sealed, probably, over the knot. The Argilian, according <lb/>
            to Nepos, contrived to take off the string without breaking the seal, -so <lb/>
            that he might readily replace it. </note> <pb n="328"/>
            </p>
          <p>They accordingly directed the informer what they wished <lb/>
            to have done. At Tænarus there is a temple of Neptune, <lb/>
            which the Greeks account it a heinous crime to profane. To <lb/>
            this temple the informer fled, and sat down on the steps of <lb/>
            the altar. Close to the building, they made a recess under <lb/>
            ground, from which, if any one held communication with the <lb/>
            Argilian, he might be overheard; and into this place some <lb/>
            the Ephori went down. Pausanias, when he heard that the <lb/>
            Argilian had fled to the altar, came thither in great trepida­ <lb/>
            tion, and seeing him sitting as a suppliant at the altar of the <lb/>
            divinity, he inquired of him what was the cause of so sudden a <lb/>
            proceeding. The Argilian then informed him what he had <lb/>
            learned from the letter, and Pausanias, being so much the more <lb/>
            agitated, began to entreat him " not to make any discovery, or <lb/>
            to betray him who deserved great good at his hands;" adding <lb/>
            that, "if he would but grant him this favour, and assist him <lb/>
            when involved in such perplexities, it should be of great <lb/>
            advantage to him</p>
          <p>V. The Ephori, hearing these particulars, thought it better <lb/>
            that he should be apprehended in the city. After they had <lb/>
            set out thither, and Pausanias, having, as he thought, pacified <lb/>
            the Argilian, was also returning to Lacedæmon, he understood <lb/>
            (just as he was on the point of being made prisoner) by a <lb/>
            look from one of the Ephori who wished to warn him, that <lb/>
            some secret mischief was intended against him. He accord­ <lb/>
            ingly fled for refuge, a few steps before those who pursued <lb/>
            him, into the temple of Minerva, which is called Chalcicecos.* <lb/>
            That he might not escape from thence, the Ephori immediately <lb/>
            blocked up the folding-doors of the temple, and pulled off the <lb/>
            roof, that he might more readily die in the open air. It is <lb/>
            said that the mother of Pausanias was then living, and that, <lb/>
            though very aged, she was among the first to bring a stone, <lb/>
            when she heard of her son's guilt, to the door of the temple, <lb/>
            in order to shut him in. Thus Pausanias tarnished his great <lb/>
            glory in war by a dishonourable death.</p>
          <p>As soon as he was carried, half-dead, out of the temple, lie <lb/>
            gave up the ghost. When some said that his body ought to <note type="footnote"> * Quæ Chalcilœcos vocatur.] Whether the quæ refers to ædem or <lb/>

            jority, and they interred him at some distance from the spot in <lb/>
            which he died. He was afterwards removed from thence, in <lb/>
            consequence of an admonition from the Delphic god, and <lb/>
            buried in the same place where he had ended his life.</p>

            <title type="sub">V. CIMON.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Cimon is compelled to go to prison on the death of his father; is <lb/>
            liberated by his wife, I.—His character and actions; he defeats <lb/>
            the Persians by land and sea on the same day, II.—Is ostracised <lb/>
            and recalled, and makes peace with the Lacedæmonians; his <lb/>
            death, III.—His praises, IV.</p>
          <p>I. CIMON, the son of Miltiades, an Athenian, experienced a <lb/>
            very unhappy entrance on manhood; for as his father had been <lb/>
            unable to pay to the people the fine imposed upon him, and had <lb/>
            consequently died in the public gaol, Cimon was kept in prison, <lb/>
            nor could he, by the Athenian laws,* be set at liberty, <lb/>
            unless he paid the sum of money that his father had been <lb/>
            fined. He had married, however, his sister by the father's <lb/>
            side,f named Elpinice, induced not more by love than by <lb/>
            custom ; for the Athenians are allowed to marry their sisters <lb/>
            by the same father ; and a certain Callias, a man whose birth <lb/>
            was not equal to his wealth, and who had made a great fortune <lb/>
            from the mines, being desirous of having her for a wife, tried <lb/>
            to prevail on Cimon to resign her to him, saying that if he <lb/>
            obtained his desire, he would pay the fine for him. Though <lb/>
            Cimon received such a proposal with scorn, Elpinice said that <lb/>
            she would not allow a son of Miltiades to die in the public <lb/>
            prison, when she could prevent it; and that she would marry <lb/>
            Callias if he would perform what he promised.</p>
          <p>II. Cimon, being thus set free from confinement, soon <lb/>
            attained great eminence; for he had considerable eloquence, <note type="footnote"> *Neque legibus Atheniensibus emitti poterat.] Yet by Justin, ii. 15, <lb/>

            others, it has been said that Cimon's submission to go to prison was <lb/>
            voluntary. Bos collects ample testimony to the contrary. </note><note type="footnote"> t See note on the preface. </note> <lb/>

            the utmost generosity, and great skill, not only in civil Jaw, <lb/>
            but in military affairs, as he had been employed from his boy­ <lb/>
            hood with his father in the army. He in consequence held <lb/>
            the people of the city under his control, and had great influ­ <lb/>
            ence over the troops. In his first term of service, on the river <lb/>
            Strymon, he put to flight great forces of the Thracians, <lb/>
            founded the city of Amphipolis, and sent thither ten thousand <lb/>
            Athenian citizens as a colony. He also, in a second expe­ <lb/>
            dition. conquered and took at Mycale a fleet of two hundred <lb/>
            ships belonging to the Cyprians and Phoenicians, and ex­ <lb/>
            perienced like good fortune by land on the same day; for <lb/>
            after capturing the enemy's vessels, he immediately led out his <lb/>
            troops from the fleet, and overthrew at the first onset a vast <lb/>
            force of the barbarians. By this victory he obtained a great <lb/>
            quantity of spoil; and, as some of the islands, through the <lb/>
            rigour of the Athenian government, had revolted from them, <lb/>
            he secured the attachment, in the course of his return home, <lb/>
            of such as were well disposed, and obliged the disaffected to <lb/>
            return to their allegiance. Scyros, which the Dolopes at that <lb/>
            time inhabited, he depopulated, because it had behaved itself <lb/>
            insolently, ejecting the old settlers from the city and island, <lb/>
            and dividing the lands among his own countrymen. The <lb/>
            Thasians, who relied upon their wealth, he reduced as soon <lb/>
            as he attacked them. With these spoils the citadel of Athens <lb/>
            was adorned on the side which looks to the south.</p>
          <p>III. When, by these acts, he had attained greater honour <lb/>
            in the state than any other man, he fell under the same public <lb/>
            odium as his father, and others eminent among the Athenians ; <lb/>
            for by the votes of the shells, which they call the ostracism, <lb/>
            he was condemned to ten years' exile. Of this proceeding the <lb/>
            Athenians repented sooner than himself; for after he had sub­ <lb/>
            mitted, with great fortitude, to the ill-feeling of his ungrateful <lb/>
            countrymen, and the Lacedæmonians had declared war against <lb/>
            the Athenians, a desire for his well-known bravery im­ <lb/>
            mediately ensued. In consequence, he was summoned back <lb/>
            to his country five years after he had been banished from it. <lb/>
            But as he enjoyed the guest-friendship* of the Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            he thought it better to hasten to Sparta, and accordingly pro­ <note type="footnote"> * Hospitio.] See note on Themistocles, c. 8. Hospitium might exist <lb/>

            ceeded thither of his own accord, and settled a peace between <lb/>
            those two most powerful states.</p>
          <p>Being sent as commander, not long after, to Cyprus, with a <lb/>
            fleet of two hundred ships, he fell sick, after he had conquered <lb/>
            the greater part of the island, and died in the town of Citium.</p>
          <p>IV. The Athenians long felt regret for him, not only in <lb/>
            war, but in time of peace; for he was a man of such liberality, <lb/>
            that though he had farms and gardens in several parts, he <lb/>
            never set a guard over them for the sake of preserving <lb/>
            the fruit, so that none might be hindered from enjoying his <lb/>
            property as he pleased. Attendants always followed him with <lb/>
            money, that, if any one asked his assistance, he might have <lb/>
            something to give him immediately, lest, by putting him off, <lb/>
            he should appear to refuse. Frequently, when he saw a man <lb/>
            thrown in his way by chance* in a shabby dress, he gave <lb/>
            him his own cloak. A dinner was dressed for him daily in such <lb/>
            abundance, that he could invite all whom he saw in the forum <lb/>
            uninvited ; a ceremony which he did not fail to observe every <lb/>
            day. His protection, his assistance, his pecuniary means, <lb/>
            were withheld from none. He enriched many; and he buried <lb/>
            at his own cost many poor persons, who at their death had <lb/>
            not left sufficient for their interment. In consequence of <lb/>
            such conduct, it is not at all surprising that his life was free <lb/>
            from trouble, and his death severely felt.</p>

          <p>I. LYSANDER, the Lacedæmonian, left a high character of <lb/>
            himself, which was gained, however, more by good fortune <note type="footnote"> * Offensum fortund ] That is, cam obvium, fortuita oblatum, "thrown <lb/>

             <pb n="332"/>
            than by merit. That he subdued the Athenians, when thej <lb/>
            were at war with the Lacedæmonians, in the twenty-sixth <lb/>
            year of the contest, is certain; but how he obtained that con­ <lb/>
            quest is but little known; for it was not effected by the valour <lb/>
            of his own troops, but by the want of discipline among the <lb/>
            enemy, who, from not being obedient to the commands of their <lb/>
            leaders, but straggling about in the fields, and abandoning their <lb/>
            vessels, fell into the power of their adversaries ; in conse­ <lb/>
            quence of which disaster the Athenians submitted to the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians.</p>
          <p>Lysander, elated with this victory, and having always before <lb/>
            been a factious and bold man, allowed himself such liberty, <lb/>
            that the Lacedæmonians, through his conduct, incurred the <lb/>
            greatest unpopularity throughout Greece; for they having said <lb/>
            that their object in going to war was to humble the overbear­ <lb/>
            ing tyranny of the Athenians, Lysander, after he had captured <lb/>
            the enemy's fleet at Ægospotamos, endeavoured after nothing <lb/>
            so much as to keep all the states of Greece under his autho­ <lb/>
            rity, while he pretended that he acted thus for the sake of <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians. Having every where ejected those who <lb/>
            favoured the party of the Athenians, he made choice of ten men <lb/>
            in each city, on whom he conferred supreme authority, and the <lb/>
            control of all proceedings. Into the number of these no <lb/>
            one was admitted who was not attached to him by friendship, <lb/>
            or who had not assured him, by pledging his faith, that he <lb/>
            would be entirely at his disposal.</p>
          <p>II. The decem viral government being thus established in <lb/>
            every city, everything was done according to his pleasure. Of <lb/>
            his cruelty and perfidy it is sufficient to give one instance, by <lb/>
            way of example, that we may not weary our readers by enu­ <lb/>
            merating many acts of the same individual. As he was <lb/>
            returning in triumph from Asia, and bad turned aside towards <lb/>
            Thasos, he endeavoured, as the people had been eminent for <lb/>
            fidelity to the Athenians, to corrupt them,* as if those were <lb/>
            wont to be the firmest friends who had been steady enemies. <lb/>
            But he saw that unless he concealed his intention in the affair,, <note type="footnote"> * Pervertere.] " Corrupt" is evidently the sense of pervertere in this <lb/>
            passage, not " destroy," as some would make it. Lysander first <lb/>

            and afterwards, when he found his endeavours unsuccessful, proceeded <lb/>
            to use treachery and cruelty towards them. </note> <lb/>

            affront, he entered upon measures to remove the kings of <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians; but he found that he could not effect <lb/>
            his object without support from the gods, because the Lace <lb/>
            dæmonians were accustomed to refer everything to the oracles. <lb/>
            In the first place, therefore, he endeavoured to corrupt Delphi, <lb/>
            and, when he could not succeed in doing so, he made an <lb/>
            attempt upon Dodona. Being disappointed there also, he gave <lb/>
            out that he had made vows which he must pay to Jupiter <lb/>
            Ammon, thinking that he would bribe the Africans with greater <lb/>
            ease. When he had gone, accordingly, with this expectation <lb/>
            into Africa, the priests of Jupiter greatly disappointed him, <lb/>
            for they not only would not be bribed, but even sent deputies <lb/>
            to Lacedæmon to accuse Lysander of " having endeavoured to <lb/>
            corrupt the ministers of the temple." After being brought to <lb/>
            trial on this charge, and being acquitted by the votes of his <lb/>
            judges, he was sent with some auxiliary troops to the Orcho­ <lb/>
            menians, and killed by the Thebans at Haliartus. How just <lb/>
            was the decision regarding him,t the speech was a proof, <lb/>
            which was found in his house after his death, and in which he <lb/>
            recommended to the Lacedæmonians, that, after they had <lb/>
            abolished the regal government, a leader should be chosen <lb/>
            from among the whole people to conduct the war ; but it was <lb/>
            written in such a manner, that it might seem to be in accord­ <note type="footnote"> * The account of Lysander's treachery to the Thasians is wanting <lb/>
            in the manuscripts, but may be supplied from Polyænus, i. 45. Those <lb/>
            of the Thasians who had the greatest reason to fear Lysander, had fled <lb/>
            to a temple of Hercules, which was held in the greatest veneration. <lb/>
            At this temple Lysander called them all together to hear him address <lb/>
            them, when he made them a speech full of the fairest promises of <lb/>
            mercy and clemency. He said that he would think nothing of what <lb/>
            was past; that no one had cause for fear or concealment; that they <lb/>
            might all appear before him with full confidence in his good feelings <lb/>
            towards them; and that he called Hercules, in whose temple they <lb/>
            were, to witness that he spoke only what he meant. Having thus <lb/>
            drawn them forth from their sanctuary, he, a few days after, when <lb/>
            they were free from apprehension, fell upon them and put them to <lb/>
            death. " He was guilty of a similar instance of perfidy at Miletus," <lb/>
            says Bos, " as is also related by Polyænus, and by Plutarch." </note><note type="footnote"> t. Quàm vert de eo ford judicatum.] That is, how little he deserved <lb/>

            ance with the advice of the gods, which he, relying on his <lb/>
            money, did not doubt that he should procure. This speech <lb/>
            Cleon of Halicarnassus is said to have written for him</p>
          <p>IV. In this place a transaction of Pharnabazus, the king's <lb/>
            satrap, must not be omitted. When Lysander, as commander <lb/>
            of the fleet, had done many cruel and avaricious acts in the <lb/>
            course of the war, and suspected that reports of these proceed­ <lb/>
            ings had been made to his countrymen, he asked Pharnabazus <lb/>
            to give him a testimonial to present to the Ephori, showing <lb/>
            with what conscientiousnes he had carried on the war and <lb/>
            treated the allies, begging him to write fully concerning the <lb/>
            matter, as his authority on that head would be great. Phar. <lb/>
            nabazus promised him fairly, and wrote a long and full letter,* <lb/>
            in which he extolled him with the greatest praises. But when <lb/>
            Lysander had read and approved of it, Pharnabazus substi­ <lb/>
            tuted, while it was being sealed, another of the same size in its <lb/>
            place, so like it that it could not be distinguished from it, in <lb/>
            which he had most circumstantially accused him of avarice and <lb/>
            perfidy. Lysander, accordingly, when he had returned home, <lb/>
            and had said what he wished before the chief magistrates, <lb/>
            handed them, as a testimonial, the letter which he had received <lb/>
            from Pharnabazus. The Ephori, after having perused it when <lb/>
            Lysander was withdrawn, gave it to him to read. Thus he <lb/>
            became unawares his own accuser.</p>

          <p>I. ALCIBIADES, t son of Clinias, was a native of Athens. <lb/>
            In him nature seems to have tried what she could do; for it is <lb/>
            agreed among all who have written concerning him, that no <note type="footnote"> * Librum gravem multis verbis. " A heavy lettex in many w <unclear>ds</unclear>." </note> <lb/>

            one was ever more remarkable than he, either for vices or vir­ <lb/>
            tues. Born in a most distinguished city, of a very high <lb/>
            family, and by far the most handsome of all the men of his <lb/>
            age, he was qualified for any occupation, and abounded in <lb/>
            practical intelligence. He was eminent as a commander by <lb/>
            sea and lai d; he was eloquent, so as to produce the greatest <lb/>
            effect by his speeches; for such indeed was the persuasiveness <lb/>
            of his looks and language, that in oratory no one was a match <lb/>
            for him. He was rich,. and, when occasion required, labo­ <lb/>
            rious, patient, liberal, and splendid, no less in his public than in <lb/>
            his private life; t he was also affable and courteous, conform­ <lb/>
            ing dexterously to circumstances; but, when he had unbent <lb/>
            himself, and no reason offered why he should endure the <lb/>
            labour of thought, was seen to be luxurious, dissolute, volup­ <lb/>
            tuous, and self-indulgent, so that all wondered there should <lb/>
            be such dissimilitude, and so contradictory a nature, in the <lb/>
            same man.</p>
          <p>II. He was brought up in the house of Pericles (for he is <lb/>
            said to have been his step-son),‡ and was taught by Socrates. <lb/>
            For his father-in-law he had Hipponicus, the richest man of <lb/>
            all that spoke the Greek language; so that, even if he had <lb/>
            contrived for himself, he could neither have thought of more <lb/>
            advantages, nor have secured greater, than those which fortune <lb/>
            or nature had bestowed upon him. At his entrance on man­ <lb/>
            hood he was beloved by many, after the manner of the <lb/>
            Greeks, and among them by Socrates, whom Plato mentions <lb/>
            in his Symposium; for he introduces Alcibiades, saying that <lb/>
            " he had passed the night with Socrates, and had not risen up <lb/>
            from him otherwise than a son should rise from a father." <lb/>
            When he was of maturer age, he had himself no fewer objects <note type="footnote"> * Dives; quum tempus posceret, &amp;c.] This is Boa's reading. Many <lb/>

            however, to have been the step-father of Alcibiades('s wife, as Magius <lb/>
            observes; for Alcibiades married Hipparete, the daughter of Hippor <unclear/> <lb/>

            of affection, his intercourse with whom, as far as was possible, <lb/>
            he did many acts of an objectionable character, in a delicate <lb/>
            and agreeable manner; which acts we would relate, had we <lb/>
            not other things to tell of a higher and better nature.</p>
          <p>III. In the Peloponnesian war, the Athenians, by his ad­ <lb/>
            vice and persuasion, declared war against the Syracusans, to <lb/>
            conduct which he himself was chosen general. Two colleagues <lb/>
            were besides assigned him, Nicias and Lamachus. While the <lb/>
            expedition was in preparation, and before the fleet sailed, it <lb/>
            happened one night that all the statues of Mercury* that were <lb/>
            in the city of Athens were thrown down, except one, which <lb/>
            was before the gate of Andocides, and which, in consequence, <lb/>
            was afterwards generally called the Mercury of Andocides.† <lb/>
            As it appeared that this could not have been done without a <lb/>
            strong confederacy of many persons, since it had respect not <lb/>
            to a private but to a public matter,‡ great dread was excited <lb/>
            among the multitude, lest some sudden tumult should arise in <lb/>
            the city to destroy the people's liberty. The suspicion of this <lb/>
            seemed chiefly to attach to Alcibiades, because he was con­ <lb/>
            sidered both more influential, and of higher standing, than <lb/>
            any private person; for he had secured many adherents by his <lb/>
            generosity, and had made still more his friends by assisting <lb/>
            them in legal proceedings. Hence it happened, that as often <lb/>
            as he appeared in public, he drew the eyes of all people upon <lb/>
            him; nor was any man in the whole city thought equal to <lb/>
            him. They accordingly bad not only the greatest hope of <lb/>
            him, but also the greatest fear, because he was able to do <lb/>
            much harm as well as much good. He was sullied also by ill <lb/>
            report, for it was said that he celebrated the mysteries § in his <note type="footnote"> * Omnes Hermœ.] Mercury was reckoned the god of thieves, <unclear>an1</unclear> <lb/>

            own house, a practice which, according to public opinion <lb/>
            among the Athenians, was regarded as impious; and this <lb/>
            matter was thought to have reference, not to religion, but to <lb/>
            a conspiracy.*</p>
          <p>IV. Of this crime he was accused by his enemies in a <lb/>
            public assembly of the people. But the time for him to set <lb/>
            out to the war was drawing near; and he considering this, <lb/>
            and being aware of the habit t of his countrymen, requested <lb/>
            that, if they wished anything to be done concerning him, an <lb/>
            examination should rather be held upon him while he was pre <lb/>
            sent, than that he should be accused in his absence of a crime <lb/>
            against which there was a strong public feeling. ‡ But his <lb/>
            enemies resolved to continue quiet for the present, because <lb/>
            they were aware that no hurt could then be done him, and to <lb/>
            wait for the time when he should have gone abroad, that they <lb/>
            might thus attack him while he was absent. They accordingly <lb/>
            did so; for after they supposed that he had reached Sicily, <lb/>
            they impeached him, during his absence, of having profaned <lb/>
            the sacred rites. In consequence of this affair, a messenger, <lb/>
            to desire him to return home to plead his cause, being de­ <lb/>
            spatched into Sicily to him by the government, at a time <lb/>
            when he had great hopes of managing his province success­ <lb/>
            fully, he yet did not refuse to obey, but went on board a <lb/>
            trireme which had been sent to convey him. Arriving in this <lb/>
            vessel at Thurii in Italy, and reflecting much with himself on <lb/>
            the ungovernable license § of his countrymen, and their violent <lb/>
            feelings towards the aristocracy, and deeming it most advan­ <lb/>
            tageous to avoid the impending storm, he secretly withdrew <lb/>
            from his guards, and went from thence first to Elis, and after­ <lb/>
            wards to Thebes. But when he heard that he was condemned <lb/>
            to death, his property having been confiscated, and as had <lb/>
            been usual, that the priests called Eumolpidæ had been <lb/>
            obliged by the people to curse him, and that a copy of the <lb/>
            curse, engraven on a stone pillar, had been set up in a public <lb/>
            place, in order that the memory of it might be better attested, <note type="footnote"> * They thought that there was some conspiracy under the cloak of <lb/>

            he removed to Lacedæmon. There, as he was accustomed to <lb/>
            declare, he carried on a war, not against his country, but <lb/>
            against his enemies, because the same persons were enemies <lb/>
            to their own city; for though they knew that he could be of <lb/>
            the greatest service to the republic, they had expelled him <lb/>
            from it, and consulted their own animosity more than the <lb/>
            common advantage. By his advice, in consequence, the Lace <lb/>
            dæmonians made an alliance with the king of Peisia, and <lb/>
            afterwards fortified Deceleia in Attica, and having placed a <lb/>
            constant garrison there, kept Athens in a state of blockade. <lb/>
            By his means, also, they detached Ionia from its alliance with <lb/>
            the Athenians, and after this was done, they began to have <lb/>
            greatly the advantage in the contest.</p>
          <p>V. Yet by these proceedings they were not so much ren­ <lb/>
            dered friends to Alcibiades, as alienated from him by fear; <lb/>
            for when they saw the singular intelligence of this most active- <lb/>
            minded man in every way, they were afraid that, being moved <lb/>
            by love for his country, he might at some time revolt from <lb/>
            them, and return into favour with his countrymen. They <lb/>
            therefore determined to seek an opportunity for killing him. <lb/>
            But this determination could not long be concealed from <lb/>
            Alcibiades; for he was a man of such sagacity that he could <lb/>
            not be deceived, especially when he turned his attention to <lb/>
            putting himself on his guard. He in consequence betook him­ <lb/>
            self to Tissaphernes, a satrap of King Darius; and having <lb/>
            gained a way to an intimate friendship with him, and seeing <lb/>
            that the power of the Athenians, from the ill success of their <lb/>
            attempts in Sicily, was on the decline, while that of the Lace­ <lb/>
            daemonians, on the other hand, was increasing, he first of all <lb/>
            conferred, through messengers, with Pisander the Athenian <lb/>
            commander, who had a force at Samos, and made some men <lb/>
            tion concerning his return; for Pisander, with the same <lb/>
            feelings as Alcibiades, was no friend to the power of the <lb/>
            people, but a favourer of the aristocracy. Though deserted <lb/>
            by him,* he was received at first, through the agency of <lb/>
            Thrasybulus the son of Lycus, by the army, and made com­ <lb/>
            mander at Samos; and afterwards, from Theramenes making <lb/>
            -nterest for him, he was recalled by a decree of the people, <lb/>
            and, while still absent, was appointed to equal command with <note type="footnote"> * Ab hoc destitutus.] On the contrary, he was, according to Thucy­ <lb/>
            dides, viii. 49, 53, supported by Pisander.—Bos. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="339"/>
            Thrasybulus and Theramenes. Under the influence of these <lb/>
            leaders, so great a change in affairs took place, that the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians, who had just before flourished as conquerors, were <lb/>
            struck with fear and sued for peace; for they had been de­ <lb/>
            feated in five battles by land, and three by sea, in which they <lb/>
            had lost two hundred triremes, that had been captured and <lb/>
            had fallen into the possession of their enemies. Alcibiades, <lb/>
            with his colleagues, had recovered Ionia, the Hellespont, and <lb/>
            many Greek cities besides, situated on the coast of Asia, of <lb/>
            which they had taken several by storm, and among them <lb/>
            Byzantium. Nor had they attached fewer to their interest by <lb/>
            policy, as they had exercised clemency towards those who <lb/>
            were taken prisoners; and then, laden with spoil, and having <lb/>
            enriched the troops and achieved very great exploits, they <lb/>
            returned to Athens.</p>
          <p>VI. The whole city having gone down to the Piræeus to <lb/>
            meet them, there was such a longing among them all to see <lb/>
            Alcibiades, that the multitude flocked to his galley as if he <lb/>
            had come alone; for the people were fully persuaded of this, <lb/>
            that both their former in success, and their present good <lb/>
            fortune, had happened through his means. They therefore <lb/>
            attributed the loss of Sicily, and the victories of the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians, to their own fault, in having banished such a man <lb/>
            from the country. Nor did they seem to entertain this opinion <lb/>
            without reason; for after Alcibiades had begun to command <lb/>
            the army, the enemies could withstand them neither by land <lb/>
            nor by sea. As soon as he came out of his ship, though <lb/>
            Theramenes and Thrasybulus had commanded in the same <lb/>
            enterprises, and came into the Piræeus at the same time with <lb/>
            him, yet the people all followed him alone, and (what had <lb/>
            never happened before, except in the case of conquerors at <lb/>
            Olympia) he was publicly presented with golden and brazen <lb/>
            crowns. Such kindness from his countrymen be received with <lb/>
            tears, remembering their severity in past times. When he <lb/>
            arrived at the city, and an assembly of the people had been <lb/>
            called, he addressed them in such a manner, that no one was <lb/>
            so unfeeling as not to lament his ill-treatment, and declare <lb/>
            himself an enemy to those by whose agency he had been <lb/>
            driven from his country, just as if some other people, and not <lb/>
            the same people that was then weeping, had sentenced him to <note type="footnote"> Z 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="340"/>
            suffer for sacrilege. His property was in consequence made <lb/>
            good to him at the public cost, and the same priests, the <lb/>
            Eumolpidæ, who had cursed him, were obliged to recal their <lb/>
            curses; and the pillars, on which the curse had been written, <lb/>
            were thrown into the sea.</p>
          <p>VII. This happiness of Alcibiades proved by no means <lb/>
            lasting; for after all manner of honours had been decreed <lb/>
            him, and the whole management of the state, both at home <lb/>
            and in the field, had been committed to him, to be regulated <lb/>
            at his sole pleasure, and he had requested that two colleagues, <lb/>
            Thrasybulus and Adimantus, should be assigned him (a re­ <lb/>
            quest which was not refused), proceeding with the fleet to <lb/>
            Asia, he fell again under the displeasure of his countrymen, <lb/>
            because he did not manage affairs at Cyme * to their wish; <lb/>
            for they thought that he could do every thing. Hence it <lb/>
            happened that they imputed whatever was done unsuccessfully <lb/>
            to his misconduct, saying that he acted either carelessly or <lb/>
            treacherously, as it fell out on this occasion, for they alleged <lb/>
            that he would not take Cyme, because he had been bribed by <lb/>
            the king. We consider, therefore, that their extravagant <lb/>
            opinion of his abilities and valour was his chief misfortune; <lb/>
            since he was dreaded no less than he was loved, lest, elated by <lb/>
            good fortune and great power, he should conceive a desire to <lb/>
            become a tyrant. From these feelings it resulted, that they <lb/>
            took his commission from him in his absence, and put another <lb/>
            commander in his place. When he heard of this proceeding, <lb/>
            he would not return home, but betook himself to Pactye,t <lb/>
            and there established three fortresses, Bomi, Bisanthe, and <lb/>
            Neontichos, and having collected a body of troops, was the <lb/>
            first man of any Grecian state t that penetrated into Thrace, <lb/>
            thinking it more glorious to enrich himself with spoils from <lb/>
            barbarians than from Greeks. In consequence his fame in­ <note type="footnote"> * A considerable town of Æolia. But it was at Notium, near <lb/>

            creased with his power, and he secured to himself a strong <lb/>
            alliance with some of the kings of Thrace.</p>
          <p>VIII. Yet he could not give up his affection for his country; <lb/>
            for when Philocles, the commander of the Athenians, had <lb/>
            stationed his fleet at Ægospotamos, and Lysander, the captain <lb/>
            of the Lacedæmonians (who was intent upon protracting the <lb/>
            war as long as possible, because money was supplied to the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians by the king, while to the exhausted Athenians, <lb/>
            on the other hand, nothing was left but their arms and their <lb/>
            ships) was not far distant, Alcibiades came to the army of the <lb/>
            Athenians, and there, in the presence of the common soldiers <lb/>
            began to assert,* that "if they pleased, he would force <lb/>
            Lysander either to fight or beg peace; that the Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nians were unwilling to engage by sea, because they were <lb/>
            stronger in land-forces than in ships; but that it would be easy <lb/>
            for him to bring down Seuthes, king of the Thracians, to drive <lb/>
            them from the land, and that, when this was done, they would <lb/>
            of necessity either come to an engagement with their fleet, or <lb/>
            put an end to the war." Philocles, though he saw that this <lb/>
            statement was true, would not yet do what was desired, for he <lb/>
            knew that he himself, if Alcibiades were restored to the com­ <lb/>
            mand, would be of no account with the army; and that, if any <lb/>
            success resulted, his share in the matter would amount to <lb/>
            nothing, while, on the other hand, if any ill-fortune occurred, <lb/>
            he alone would be called to account for the miscarriage. <lb/>
            Alcibiades, on taking leave of him, said, " As you hinder your <lb/>
            country's success, I advise you to keep your sailors' camp <lb/>
            near the enemy ; for there is danger that, through the insub­ <lb/>
            ordination of our men, an opportunity may be afforded to <lb/>
            Lysander of cutting off our army." Nor did his apprehension <lb/>
            deceive him; for Lysander, having learned from his scouts <lb/>
            that the body of the Athenian force was gone on shore to seek <lb/>
            for plunder, and that the ships were left almost empty, did not <lb/>
            neglect the opportunity of making an attack, and by that <lb/>
            single effort put an end to the whole war.</p>
          <p>IX. Alcibiades, after the Athenians were defeated, not <lb/>
            thinking those parts sufficiently safe for him, concealed <lb/>
            himself in the inland parts of Thrace above the Propontis, <lb/>
            trusting that his wealth would most easily escape notice <lb/>
            there, But he was disappointed ; for the Thracians, when <note type="footnote"> * Agere.] In its rhetorical sense, to state, plead, declare. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="342"/>
            they learned that he had come with a great sum of money, <lb/>
            formed a plot against him, and robbed him of what he had <lb/>
            brought, but were unable to secure his person. Perceiving <lb/>
            that no place was safe for him in Greece, on account of the <lb/>
            power of the Lacedæmonians, he went over into Asia to Phar­ <lb/>
            nabazus, whom be so charmed, indeed, by his courtesy, that <lb/>
            no man had a higher place in his favour; for he gave him <lb/>
            Grunium, a strong-hold in Phrygia, from which he annually <lb/>
            received fifty talents' revenue.</p>
          <p>But with this good fortune Alcibiades was not content, not <lb/>
            could endure that Athens, conquered as she was, should con. <lb/>
            tinue subject to the Lacedæmonians. He was accordingly bent, <lb/>
            with his whole force of thought, on delivering his country, but <lb/>
            saw that that object could not be effected without the aid of <lb/>
            the king of Persia, and therefore desired that he should be <lb/>
            attached to him as a friend; nor did he doubt that he should <lb/>
            easily accomplish his wish, if he had but an opportunity for an <lb/>
            interview with him; for he knew that his brother Cyrus was <lb/>
            secretly preparing war against him, with the aid of the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians, and foresaw that, if he gave him information of <lb/>
            this design, he would find great favour at his hands.</p>
          <p>X. While he was trying to effect this object, and entreating <lb/>
            Pharnabazus that he might be sent to the king, Critias, and <lb/>
            the other tyrants of the Athenians, despatched at the same <lb/>
            time persons in their confidence into Asia to Lysander, to <lb/>
            acquaint him, that, " unless he cut off Alcibiades, none of <lb/>
            those arrangements which he had made at Athens would <lb/>
            stand; and therefore, if he wished his acts to remain unaltered, <lb/>
            he must pursue him to death." The Lacedæmonian, roused <lb/>
            by this message, concluded that he must act in a more decided <lb/>
            manner with Pharnabazus. He therefore announced to him, <lb/>
            that " the relations which the king had formed with the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians would be of no effect, unless he delivered up <lb/>
            Alcibiades alive or dead." The satrap could not withstand this <lb/>
            menace, and chose rather to violate the claims of humanity <lb/>
            than that the king's interest should suffer. He accordingly <lb/>
            sent Sysamithres and Bagæus to kill Alcibiades, while he was <lb/>
            still in Phrygia, and preparing for his journey to the king. <lb/>
            The persons sent gave secret orders to the neighbourhood, in <lb/>
            which Alcibiades then was, to put him to death. They, not <lb/>
            daring to attack him with the sword, collected wood during <lb/>
             <pb n="343"/>
            the night round the cottage in which he was sleeping, and set <lb/>
            light to it, that they might despatch by fire him whom they <lb/>
            despaired of conquering hand to hand.* Alcibiades, having <lb/>
            been awakened by the crackling of the flames, snatched up (as <lb/>
            his word had been secretly taken away from him) the side­ <lb/>
            weapon of a friend of his; for there was with him a certain <lb/>
            associate from Arcadia, who would never leave him. This <lb/>
            man he desired to follow him, and caught up whatever gar­ <lb/>
            ments he had at hand, and throwing them out upon the fire, <lb/>
            passed through the violence of the flames. When the barba­ <lb/>
            rians saw that he had escaped the conflagration, they killed <lb/>
            him by discharging darts at him from a distance,† and carried <lb/>
            his head to Phamabazus.</p>
          <p>A woman, who had been accustomed to live with him, <lb/>
            burned his dead body, covered with her own female garments, <lb/>
            in the fire of the house which had been prepared to burn him <lb/>
            alive. Thus Alcibiades, at the age of about forty, came to <lb/>
            his end.</p>
          <p>XI. This man, defamed by most writers, three historians of <lb/>
            very high authority have extolled with the greatest praises; <lb/>
            Thucydides, who was of the same age with him ; Theopompus, <lb/>
            who was born some time after; and Timaeus ; the two latter, <lb/>
            though much addicted to censure, have, I know not how, con­ <lb/>
            curred in praising him only; for they have related of him <lb/>
            what we have stated above, and this besides, that though he was <lb/>
            born in Athens, the most splendid of cities, he surpassed all <lb/>
            the Athenians in grandeur and magnificence of living; that <lb/>
            when, on being banished from thence, he went to Thebes, he <lb/>
            so devoted himself to the pursuits of the Thebans, that no <lb/>
            man could match him in laborious exercises and vigour of <lb/>
            body, for all the Bœotians cultivate corporeal strength more <lb/>
            than mental power; that when he was among the Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nians, in whose estimation the highest virtue is placed in <lb/>
            endurance, he so resigned himself to a hardy way of life, that <lb/>
            he surpassed all the Lacedæmonians in the frugality of his diet <lb/>
            and living; that when he was among the Thracians, who are <lb/>
            hard drinkers and given to lewdness, he surpassed them also in <note type="footnote"> * Quern manu superari posse diffidebant.] " Whom they despaired <lb/>
            would be able (Le. whom they expected or thought would be unable) <lb/>
            to be overcome by the hand." </note><note type="footnote"> t Eminus.] Bos would omit this word, as wanting authority. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="344"/>
            these practices ; that when he came among the Persians, with <lb/>
            whom it was the chief praise to hunt hard and live high, he <lb/>
            so imitated their mode of life, that they themselves greatly <lb/>
            admired him in these respects; and that by such conduct, he <lb/>
            occasioned that, with whatever people he was, he was regarded <lb/>
            as a leading man, and held in the utmost esteem. But we <lb/>
            have said enough of him; let us proceed to speak of others.</p>

            crown; is killed on the coast of Sicily, IV.</p>
          <p>I. THRASYBULUS, the son of Lycus, was a native of Athens. <lb/>
            If merit is to be valued by itself, without regard to fortune, I <lb/>
            doubt whether I ought not to place him first of all the Greek <lb/>
            commanders. This I can say without hesitation, that I set no <lb/>
            man above him in integrity, firmness, greatness of mind, and <lb/>
            love for his country; for while many have wished, and few <lb/>
            have been able, to deliver their country from one tyrant, it <lb/>
            was his lot to restore his country, oppressed by thirty tyrants, <lb/>
            from slavery to freedom. But though no man excelled <lb/>
            him in these virtues, many, I know not how, surpassed him <lb/>
            in fame.</p>
          <p>First of all, in the Peloponnesian war, he accomplished <lb/>
            many undertakings without Alcibiades, while Alcibiades did <lb/>
            nothing without him ; of all which successes Alcibiades, from <lb/>
            certain natural advantages, got the credit. All such actions, <lb/>
            however, are common to commanders with their soldiers and <lb/>
            with fortune; for, in the shock of battle, the issue is trans­ <lb/>
            ferred from generalship to the strength and fury of the <lb/>
            combatants. The soldier, therefore, of his own right, takes <lb/>
            something from the general, and fortune a great deal, and may <lb/>
            truly say that she has had more influence on the event than <lb/>
            the skill of the commander. This most noble action, then, is <lb/>
            entirely Thrasybulus's ; for when the Thirty Tyrants, ap <lb/>
            pointed by the Lacedæmonians, kept Athens oppressed in a <lb/>
            state of slavery, and had partly banished from their country, <lb/>
            and partly put to death, a great number of the citizens whom <lb/>
             <pb n="345"/>
            fortune had spared in the war, and had divided their confis <lb/>
            cated property among themselves, he was not only the first, but <lb/>
            the only man at the commencement, to declare war against <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>II. When he fled to Phyle, which is a very strong fortress <lb/>
            in Attica, he had not more than thirty of his countrymen with <lb/>
            him; such was the origin of the deliverance of the Athenians, <lb/>
            such the dependence of the liberty of that most famous city. <lb/>
            He was at first, indeed, despised by the tyrants, as well as the <lb/>
            small number of his followers; which circumstance proved <lb/>
            both the ruin of those that despised him, and the security of <lb/>
            him that was despised, for it rendered the one party slow to <lb/>
            attack, and the other stronger by giving them time for prepa­ <lb/>
            ration. The maxim, therefore, that " nothing should be <lb/>
            despised in war," ought the more deeply to be fixed in the <lb/>
            minds of all; and we should remember that it is not said <lb/>
            without reason, that " the mother of a cautious person. is not <lb/>
            accustomed to weep." The force of Thrasybulus, however, <lb/>
            was not increased in proportion to his expectations; for even <lb/>
            in those times good men spoke for liberty with more spirit <lb/>
            than they fought for it.</p>
          <p>Hence he went to the Piræeus, and fortified the Munychia,t <lb/>
            which the tyrants twice attempted to storm, but being dis­ <lb/>
            gracefully repulsed, and having lost their arms and baggage, <lb/>
            they immediately fled back to the city. Thrasybulus, on this <lb/>
            occasion, exercised not less prudence than valour; for he for­ <lb/>
            bade those that fled to be injured, thinking it just that <lb/>
            " countrymen should spare countrymen;" nor was any one <lb/>
            wounded except such as would attack him first. He spoiled <lb/>
            no one, as he lay, of his clothes; he laid hands on nothing but <lb/>
            arms, of which he was in want, and provisions.‡ In the <lb/>
            second battle Critias, the leader of the tyrants, was killed, <note type="footnote"> * Matrem timidi flere non solere.] I have translated this according <lb/>
            to the notion of Bremi, who says that timidus here means a cautious <lb/>
            person, one who takes care of himself, and is on his guard against <lb/>
            contingencies. Most translators have rendered it "the mother of a <lb/>
            coward," &amp;c., in which sense it would seem that the proverb was gene­ <lb/>

             <pb n="346"/>
            after having, indeed, fought with great bravery against Thra­ <lb/>
            sybulus.</p>
          <p>III. Critias being overthrown, Pausanias, king of the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians, came to the support of the Athenians. He made <lb/>
            peace between Thrasybulus and those who held the town, on <lb/>
            these conditions : " That none should be banished except the <lb/>
            Thirty Tyrants, and the Ten, who, having been afterwards made <lb/>
            governors, had followed the example of their predecessors in <lb/>
            cruelty;. that no property should be confiscated; and that <lb/>
            the government of the republic should be restored to the <lb/>
            hands of the people. It was an honourable act of Thrasy <lb/>
            bulus, that, when peace was settled, and he had become the <lb/>
            most powerful person in the state, he made a law, " that no <lb/>
            one should be brought to trial, or punished, for things dcne <lb/>
            previously;" and this they called " the act of oblivion." Nor <lb/>
            did he only cause this law to be passed, but also took care that <lb/>
            it should be of effect; for when some of them who had <lb/>
            been with him in exile, wished to put to death those with <lb/>
            whom they nad returned to a good understanding, he openly <lb/>
            prevented it. and adhered to what he had promised.</p>
          <p>IV. For such merits a crown of honour was presented him <lb/>
            by the people, made of two sprigs of olive, which, as the love <lb/>
            of his countrymen, and not force, had procured it him, excited <lb/>
            no envy, but was a great glory to him. The celebrated <lb/>
            Pittacus, therefore who was reckoned in the number of the <lb/>
            seven wise men, said well, when the Mitylenæans offered to <lb/>
            give him several thousand aerest of land, " Do not, I be­ <lb/>
            seech you, give me what many may envy and more may <lb/>
            covet; for which reason I had rather take, out of that num­ <lb/>
            ber, not more than a hundred acres, which will prove both the <lb/>
            moderation of my desires and your good will." For small <lb/>
            gifts are lasting; but valuable presents are not wont to be <lb/>
            permanent. ‡ Thrasybulus, accordingly, being content with <note type="footnote"> * Superioris more crudelitatis erant usi.] " Had used the manner of <lb/>

          <p>I. CONON the Athenian entered upon public life in the <lb/>
            Peloponnesian war, and his service in it was of great value; <lb/>
            for he was both general of the forces by land, and, as com­ <lb/>
            mander of the fleet, performed great exploits by sea ; for these <lb/>
            reasons particular honour was conferred upon him, for he had <lb/>
            the sole authority over all the islands; in which office he took <lb/>
            Pheræ, a colony of the Lacedæmonians. He was also com­ <lb/>
            mander towards the end of the Peloponnesian war, when the <lb/>
            forces of the Athenians were defeated by Lysander at Ægos­ <lb/>
            potamos; but he was then absent; and hence the affair was <lb/>
            worse managed; for he was both skilled in military matters, <lb/>
            and a careful general. It was doubted by nobody, therefore, <lb/>
            in those days, that the Athenians, if he had been present, <lb/>
            would not have met with that disaster.</p>
          <p>II. But when the affairs of the Athenians were in a ca­ <lb/>
            lamitous condition, and he heard that his native city was <lb/>
            besieged, he did not seek a place where he might himself live <lb/>
            in security, but one from which he might render assistance to <lb/>
            his countrymen. He in consequence betook himself to Phar­ <lb/>

            and relative of the king, with whom, by much exertion and at <lb/>
            great hazard, he contrived to procure himself strong personal <lb/>
            influence; * for when the Lacedæmonians, after the Athenians <lb/>
            were subdued, did not adhere to the alliance which they had <lb/>
            made with Artaxerxes, but sent Agesilaus into Asia to make <lb/>
            war (being chiefly induced to that course by Tissaphernes, f <lb/>
            who, from being one of the king's confidants, had renounced <lb/>
            his attachment to him, and entered into an alliance with the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians), Pharnabazus was regarded as general against <lb/>
            Agesilaus, but Conon in reality led the army, and everything <lb/>
            was done according to his direction. He greatly obstructed <lb/>
            that eminent commander Agesilaus, and often thwarted hia <lb/>
            plans. It was indeed apparent, that, if Conon had not been <lb/>
            there, Agesilaus would have taken all Asia, as far as Mount <lb/>
            Taurus, from the king. And after Agesilaus was recalled <lb/>
            home by his countrymen, in consequence of the Boeotians and <lb/>
            Athenians Having declared war against the Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            Conon nevertheless remained with the king's officers, and was <lb/>
            of the greatest service to all of them.</p>
          <p>III. Tissaphernes had revolted from the king; yet his <lb/>
            defection was not so evident to Artaxerxes as to others; for <lb/>
            he had great influence with the king, by reason of his nume­ <lb/>
            rous and important services, even when he did not strictly <lb/>
            adhere to his duty; nor is it to be wondered at, if he was not <lb/>
            easily induced to credit it, remembering that by his means he <lb/>
            had overcome his brother Cyrus. Conon, being sent by Phar­ <lb/>
            nabazus to the king to assure him of his guilt, went in the <lb/>
            first place, on his arrival (after the manner of the Persians). <lb/>
            to Tithraustes, the captain of the guard, t who held the second <lb/>
            place in the empire, and signified that he wished to speak to <note type="footnote"> * Apud quem ut multùm, gratid valeret-effecit.] With whom he <lb/>

            of the life of Agesilaus. Yet Schlegel and Wetzel, he adds, have made <lb/>
            strong efforts to justify or excuse his statement. Thirlwall, however, <lb/>
            seems to come nearer to the truth in his History of Greece, c. xxxv. <lb/>

            the king j for no one is admitted without this ceremony.* <lb/>
            Tithraustes answered him, " There is no objection on my part, <lb/>
            but consider, for yourself, whether you had rather speak with <lb/>
            him, or treat by letter, as to the objects which you have in <lb/>
            view. For, if you come into the royal presence, it will <lb/>
            be necessary for you to pay adoration to the king" (which <lb/>
            the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">πςοϭϰυνει̃ν</foreign>): " if this is disagreeable to you, you <lb/>
            may nevertheless effect what you desire by stating your com­ <lb/>
            mission through me." Conon then replied, " To myself <lb/>
            indeed, it is not disagreeable to pay any honour you please to <lb/>
            the king, but I am afraid lest it should be derogatory to my <lb/>
            country, if, coming from a city which has been accustomed to <lb/>
            rule over other nations, I should observe the usages of <lb/>
            foreigners rather than its own." He therefore delivered to <lb/>
            him in writing what he wished to communicate.</p>
          <p>IV. The king, having read his statement, was so much <lb/>
            influenced by his authority, that he declared Tissaphernes an <lb/>
            enemy, desired CODon to harass the Lacedæmonians with war, <lb/>
            and gave him leave to choose whom be pleased to disburse the <lb/>
            money for his army. Conon said that such a choice was not a <lb/>
            matter for his consideration, but for the king's own, who ought <lb/>
            to know his own subjects best; but that he recommended him <lb/>
            to give that commission to Phamabazus. He was then de <lb/>
            spatched, after being honoured with valuable presents, to the <lb/>
            sea, to require the Cyprians, Phœnicians, and other maritime <lb/>
            people, to furnish ships of war, and to prepare a fleet to secure <lb/>
            the sea in the following summer, Pharnabazus, as he had <lb/>
            requested, being appointed his colleague. When this arrange­ <lb/>
            ment was made known to the Lacedæmonians, they took their <lb/>
            measures with great care, for they thought that a greater war <lb/>
            threatened them than if they had to contend with the Persians <lb/>
            only. They saw that a brave and skilful general was going to <lb/>
            lead the king's forces, and to take the field against them, a <lb/>
            man whom they could overmatch neither by stratagem nor by <lb/>
            strength. With these considerations they collected a great <lb/>
            fleet, and set sail under the leadership of Pisander. Conon, <lb/>
            attacking them near Cnidus, routed them in a great battle, took <lb/>
            several of their ships, and sunk several more, a victory by <lb/>
            which not only Athens, but also all Greece, which had been <note type="footnote"> * Sine hoc.] Some consider hoc masculine, referring to the chili <lb/>

             <pb n="350"/>
            under the power of the Lacedæmonians, was set free. Conon <lb/>
            proceeded with part of his fleet to his native city, and caused <lb/>
            the walls of the Piræeus and of Athens, both of which had <lb/>
            been pulled down, to be rebuilt, and presented to his country­ <lb/>
            men fifty talents in money, which he had received from <lb/>
            Pharnabazus.</p>
          <p>V. What happens to other men happened to him, that <lb/>
            he was more inconsiderate in good than in bad fortune; for <lb/>
            when he had defeated the fleet of the Peloponnesians, and <lb/>
            thought that he had avenged the injuries done to his country, <lb/>
            he aimed at more objects than he was in a condition to accom <lb/>
            plish. Not that these aims, however, were not patriotic and <lb/>
            deserving of praise, since he preferred that the power of his <lb/>
            country should be increased, rather than that of the king; for, <lb/>
            after he had secured himself great influence by the battle <lb/>
            which he fought at Cnidus, not only among foreigners but in <lb/>
            all the states of Greece, he began to endeavour secretly * to <lb/>
            restore Ionia and Æolia to the Athenians. But as this pro­ <lb/>
            iect was not concealed with sufficient care, Tiribazus, who was <lb/>
            governor of Sardis, sent for Conon, on pretence that he wished <lb/>
            to send him in great haste to the king ; when he had gone, in <lb/>
            compliance with this message, he was placed in confinement, <lb/>
            in which he was kept for some time. Some have left on <lb/>
            record that he was conveyed to the king, and there died. On <lb/>
            the other hand Dinont the historian, whom we chiefly credit <lb/>
            concerning Persian affairs, has related that he made his escape, <lb/>
            but is in doubt whether 't was effected with or without the <lb/>
            knowledge of Tiribazus. <note type="footnote"> * If this statement respecting Conon be true, his conduct in the <lb/>
            matter is -not to be reckoned among pia et probanda, " patriotic and <lb/>

          <p>I. DION, the son of Hipparinus, a native of Syracuse, was <lb/>
            of a noble family, and allied to both the Dionysii, the tyrants. <lb/>
            of Sicily; for the elder married Aristomache, Dion's sister, by <lb/>
            whom he had two sons, Hipparinus and Nysæus, and also two <lb/>
            daughters named Sophrosyne and Arete, the elder of whom he <lb/>
            gave in marriage to his son Dionysius,t to whom he also left <lb/>
            his dominions, and the other, Arete, to Dion.‡</p>
          <p>But Dion, besides this noble connexion, and the honourable <lb/>
            character of his ancestors, inherited many other advantages <lb/>
            from nature; among them, a disposition docile, courteous, and <lb/>
            adapted for acquiring the most important branches of know­ <lb/>
            ledge, and extreme grace of person, which is no small <lb/>
            recommendation ;§ he had also great wealth bequeathed him <lb/>
            by his father, which he himself had augmented by the presents <lb/>
            he received from the tyrant. He was familiar with the <lb/>
            elder Dionysius, not less on account of his character than his <lb/>
            relationship; for though the cruelty of Dionysius offended <lb/>
            him, yet he was desirous that he should be secure because of <lb/>
            his family connexion with himself, and still more for the sake <note type="footnote"> * Utrâque implicatus tyrannide Dionysiorum.] " Involved in," or <lb/>

            Locris, and Aristomache, the sister of Dion. But Dionysius the <lb/>
            Younger was the son of Doris; so that, if Nepos is correct in saying <lb/>
            that Sophrosyne was the daughter of Aristomache, he married his <lb/>
            half-sister. See Pluto Vit. Dion. c. 3. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Dion, therefore, as Ernstius observes, married his own niece. </note><note type="footnote"> § Quæ non minimùm commendatur.] " Which is not in the lowest <lb/>

            of his own relatives* He aided him in important matters, <lb/>
            and the tyrant was greatly influenced by his advice, unless, in <lb/>
            any case, some violent humour of his own interposed. But <lb/>
            embassies,† such at least as were of a more distinguished <lb/>
            kind, were all conducted by Dion; and by discharging them <lb/>
            assiduously, and managing faithfully, he palliated the most <lb/>
            cruel name of tyrant with his own benevolence. The Cartha­ <lb/>
            ginians so much respected him, when he was sent thither by <lb/>
            Dionysius, that they never regarded any man that spoke the <lb/>
            Greek tongue with more admiration.</p>
          <p>II. Nor did these circumstances escape the notice of <lb/>
            Dionysius, for he was sensible how great an honour he was to <lb/>
            him ; hence it happened that he showed him more favour than <lb/>
            any other person, ‡ and loved him not less than a son. When <lb/>
            a report reached Sicily, too, that Plato was come to Tarentum, <lb/>
            Dionysius could not refuse the young man leave to send for <lb/>
            him, as Dion was inflamed with a desire of hearing him. He <lb/>
            accordingly granted him that permission, and brought Plato <lb/>
            with great pomp§ to Syracuse ; whom Dion so greatly admired <lb/>
            and loved, that he devoted himself wholly to his society ; nor <lb/>
            was Plato less delighted with Dion. Although, therefore, <lb/>
            Plato was cruelly insulted by Dionysius (for he ordered him <lb/>
            to be sold |), yet he paid a second visit to the city, induced <lb/>
            again by the entreaties of Dion.</p>
          <p>In the meantime Dionysius fell ill of some disease, and <lb/>
            when he was labouring under the severity of it, Dion inquired <lb/>
            of the physicians how he was," and begged them, at the same <lb/>
            time, " if he should happen to be in extreme danger, to acquaint <lb/>
            him of it; for he wished to speak to him about a division of the <note type="footnote"> * Suorum causâ.] For the sake of Aristomache and her children. </note><note type="footnote"> + Legationes.] Most editions have omnes after legationes. Bos and <lb/>

            It was not, however, the elder, but the younger Dionysius, that received <lb/>
            Plato with such ceremony. See Plato's Epist. 3 and 7; Plutarch, Vit. <lb/>
            Dion., and Ælian, Var. Hist. iv. 18. Plato visited Sicily three times; <lb/>

            give his father a sleeping potion, that Dion might have no <lb/>
            opportunity of addressing him. The sick man, having taken <lb/>
            the draught, ended his life like one buried in deep sleep.</p>
          <p>III. Such was the commencement of the dissension between <lb/>
            Dion and Dionysius; and it was increased by many circum­ <lb/>
            stances ; yet in the beginning of his reign there subsisted for <lb/>
            a time an assumed friendship between them; and as Dion <lb/>
            persisted in soliciting Dionysius to send for Plato from Athens, <lb/>
            and follow his counsels, he, who was willing to imitate his <lb/>
            father in something, complied with his wishes. At the same <lb/>
            time, also, he brought back Philistus the historian to Syracuse, <lb/>
            a man not more friendly to the tyrant than to tyranny itself. <lb/>
            But of this author more has been said in the work of mine <lb/>
            which is written " On Historians." Plato, however, had so <lb/>
            much influence over Dionysius by his authority, and produced <lb/>
            suen an effect on him by his eloquence, that he persuaded him <lb/>
            to put an end to his tyranny, and to restore liberty to the <lb/>
            Syracusans ; but being dissuaded from his intention by the <lb/>
            representations of Philistus, he began to grow somewhat more <lb/>
            cruel.</p>
          <p>IV. Being conscious that he was surpassed by Dion in <lb/>
            ability, influence, and in the affection of the people, and fear­ <lb/>
            ing that, if he kept Dion with him, he might give him some <lb/>
            opportunity of overthrowing him, he gave him a trireme to <lb/>
            sail to Corinth, declaring that he did so for both their sakes, <lb/>
            lest, as they were afraid of each other, one of them might <lb/>
            take the other by surprise. As many people were indignant <lb/>
            at this proceeding, and as it was the cause of great hatred to <lb/>
            the tyrant, Dionysius put on board some vessels all the pro­ <lb/>
            perty of Dion that could be removed, and sent it after him ; <lb/>
            for he wished it to be thought that he had adopted that course, <lb/>
            not from hatred of the man, but for the sake of his own safety. <lb/>
            But when he heard that Dion was levying troops in the Pelo. <lb/>
            ponnesus, and endeavouring to raise a war against him, he <lb/>
            gave Arete, Dion's wife, in marriage to another man, and caused <lb/>
            his son to be brought up in such a manner, that he might, <lb/>
            through indulgence, be imbued with the most disgraceful <note type="footnote"> A A </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="354"/>
            propensities; for mistresses were brought him when but a boy, <lb/>
            before he was full grown; he was overwhelmed with wine and <lb/>
            luxuries, nor was any time allowed him to be sober. He was <lb/>
            so little able to bear such a change in his way of life, which was <lb/>
            altered after his father returned to his country (for keepers <lb/>
            were set over him to draw him from his former mode <lb/>
            of living), that he threw himself from the top of a house <lb/>
            and so perished. But I return to the point from whence I <lb/>
            digressed.</p>
          <p>V. When Dion had arrived at Corinth, and Heraclides, <lb/>
            who had been commander of the cavalry, had also come <lb/>
            thither (having been likewise banished by Dionysius), they <lb/>
            began to prepare for war in every possible way; but they made <lb/>
            but little progress; for a tyranny of many years' standing <lb/>
            was thought to be of great strength, and for that reason few <lb/>
            were induced to join in so perilous an undertaking. But <lb/>
            Dion, who trusted not so much to his troops as to the general <lb/>
            hatred towards the tyrant, setting out, with the greatest <lb/>
            courage, in two transport vessels, to attack a power of fifty <lb/>
            years' growth, defended by five hundred ships of war, ten <lb/>
            thousand cavalry, and a hundred thousand infantry, so easily <lb/>
            made an impression upon it (what seemed wonderful to all <lb/>
            people), that he entered Syracuse the third day after he <lb/>
            touched the coast of Sicily. Hence it may be understood that <lb/>
            no government is safe, unless guarded by the love of its sub­ <lb/>
            jects. Dionysius at that time was absent, and waiting for his <lb/>
            fleet in Italy, supposing that none of his enemies would come <lb/>
            against him without a great force; a supposition which de­ <lb/>
            ceived him; for Dion curbed the tyrant's pride with those <lb/>
            very men that had been under the rule of his adversary, and <lb/>
            gained possession of all that part of Sicily which had been <lb/>
            under the government of Dionysius; and with like success he <lb/>
            secured the city of Syracuse, except the citadel and the island <lb/>
            adjoining the town, and brought matters to such a state, that <lb/>
            the tyrant consented to make peace on such terms as these: that <lb/>
            Dion should have Sicily, Dionysius Italy,- and Apollocrates, <lb/>
            in whom alone Dionysius t had great confidence, Syracuse. <note type="footnote"> * That is, the portion of Italy, or Great Greece, which had been <lb/>
            under the power of the elder Dionysius, part of which was still <lb/>
            retained by his son. </note><note type="footnote"> t Lambinus first saw that we ought to read Dionysius, not Dior. </note> <pb n="355"/>
             </p>
          <p>VI. A sudden change followed close upon such eminent <lb/>
            and unexpected success, for fortune, through her fickleness, <lb/>
            endeavoured to sink him whom she had just before exalted. <lb/>
            In the first place she exercised her power over his son, of <lb/>
            whom I have previously made mention ; for after he had <lb/>
            taken back his wife, who had been given to another, and <lb/>
            wished to recal his son, from his abandoned course of sen­ <lb/>
            suality, to habits of virtue, he received, as a father, a most <lb/>
            severe affliction in the death of that son. A disagreement <lb/>
            next arose between him and Heraclides, who, refusing to yield <lb/>
            the supremacy to Dion, organized a party against him; nor <lb/>
            had he indeed less influence than Dion among the aristocracy, <lb/>
            with whose sanction he commanded the fleet, while Dion had <lb/>
            the direction of the land forces. Dion could not endure this <lb/>
            opposition patiently, but retorted with that verse of Homer in <lb/>
            the second book of the Iliad,- in which is this sentiment, <lb/>
            " That a state cannot be managed well by the government of <lb/>
            many." Much ill feeling, on the part of the people, followed <lb/>
            this remark; for he appeared to have let it escape him that <lb/>
            he wished everything to be under his own authority. This <lb/>
            feeling he did not try to soften by conciliation, but to over­ <lb/>
            come by severity, and caused Heraclides, when he came to <lb/>
            Syracuse, to be put to death.</p>
          <p>VII. This act struck extreme terror into every one; for <lb/>
            nobody, after Heraclides was killed, considered himself safe. <lb/>
            Dion, when his adversary was removed, distributed among his <lb/>
            soldiers, with greater freedom, the property of those whom he <lb/>
            knew to have been unfavourable to him. But after this <lb/>
            division had taken place, money, as his daily expenses grew <lb/>
            very great, began to fail him; nor was there anything on <lb/>
            which he could lay his hands but the property of his friends; <lb/>
            a circumstance which was attended with this effect, that while <lb/>
            he gained the soldiery, he lost the aristocracy. At this state <lb/>
            of things he was overcome with anxiety, and, being unac­ <lb/>
            customed to be ill spoken of, he could not patiently endure <lb/>
            that a bad opinion of him should be entertained by those by <lb/>
            whose praises he had just before been extolled to the skies, <note type="footnote"> Bos, Mosche, and most other editors, approve Lambinus's suggestion. <lb/>
            Van Staveren omits the name altogether the sense being sufficiently <lb/>
            clear without it. </note><note type="footnote"> * Ver. 204. </note> <note type="footnote"> A A 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="356"/>
            The common people, however, when the feelings of the <lb/>
            soldiers were rendered unfavourable towards him,* spoke with <lb/>
            less restraint, and said that " he was a tyrant not to be <lb/>
            endured."</p>
          <p>VIII. While he knew not, as he contemplated this state of <lb/>
            things, how he should put a stop to it, and was apprehensive <lb/>
            as to what it might end in, a certain Callicrates, a citizen of <lb/>
            Athens, who had accompanied him from the Peloponnesus to <lb/>
            Sicily, a man of address, subtle enough for any artifice, and <lb/>
            without any regard for religion or honour, went to him, and <lb/>
            told him that " he was in great danger on account of the dis­ <lb/>
            affection of the people and the hostile feelings of the soldiers; <lb/>
            which danger he could by no means escape, unless he com­ <lb/>
            missioned some one of his friends to pretend that he was an <lb/>
            enemy to him; and that, if he found him fit for the under­ <lb/>
            taking, he would learn the feelings of every one, and cut off <lb/>
            his enemies, as his opponents would readily disclose their <lb/>
            thoughts to any one disaffected towards him." This sug­ <lb/>
            gestion being approved, Callicrates himself undertook this <lb/>
            part, and armed himself through the unsuspiciousness of <lb/>
            Dion; he sought for accomplices to join in killing him; he <lb/>
            held meetings with his enemies, and formed an actual con­ <lb/>
            spiracy against him. But these proceedings, as many were <lb/>
            privy to what was going on, became known, and were com­ <lb/>
            municated to Aristomache, Dion's sister, and his wife Arete; <lb/>
            who, being struck with alarm, sought an interview with him <lb/>
            for whose danger they were concerned. Dion assured them <lb/>
            that no plot was concerted against him by Callicrates, but that <lb/>
            what was done, was done by his own directions. The women, <lb/>
            notwithstanding, took Callicrates into the temple of Proser­ <lb/>
            pine, and obliged him to swear that " there should be no <lb/>
            danger to Dion from him." But Callicrates, by this oath, was <lb/>
            not only not deterred from his design, but was stimulated to <lb/>
            hasten the execution of it, fearing that his plot might be laid <lb/>
            open before he had effected his purpose.</p>
          <p>IX. With this resolution, on the next festival day, while <lb/>
            Dion was keeping himself at home, secluded from the assembly <note type="footnote"> * Offensâ in eum militum voluntate.] Yet Nepos says above, in this <lb/>
            same chapter, that Dion " had gained the soldiery." Quum milites <lb/>

            of the people, and was reposing in an upper room,* he com­ <lb/>
            mitted to his accomplices the stronger parts of the city, sur­ <lb/>
            rounded Dion's house with guards, and stationed trusty persons <lb/>
            at the door, who were not to leave it; he also manned a <lb/>
            trireme with an armed force, entrusted it to his brother <lb/>
            Philocrates, and gave directions that it should be rowed about <lb/>
            in the harbour, as if he wished to exercise the rowers, with a <lb/>
            view, if fortune should baffle his attempts, to have a vessel in <lb/>
            which he might flee to a place of safety. He then chose from <lb/>
            among his followers some young men of Zacynthus, of great <lb/>
            courage and extraordinary strength, whom he ordered to go to <lb/>
            Dion's house unarmed, so that they might seem to have come <lb/>
            for the sake of speaking with him. These youths, as being <lb/>
            well known, were admitted, but as soon as they had crossed <lb/>
            the threshold, they bolted the door, seized him as he lay <lb/>
            on his couch, and bound him. A great noise ensued, so that <lb/>
            it was distinctly heard out of doors. And here it was easy to <lb/>
            be understood, as has often been said before, how unpopular <lb/>
            absolute power is, and how unhappy the life of those who had <lb/>
            rather be feared than loved; for those very guards,! if they <lb/>
            had been favourably inclined towards him, might have saved <lb/>
            him by breaking open the door, as the Zacynthians, who were <lb/>
            unarmed, were holding him still alive, calling to those without <lb/>
            for a weapon. Nobody coming to his rescue, one Lyco, a <lb/>
            Syracusan, gave them a sword through the window, with which <lb/>
            Dion was slain.</p>
          <p>X. When the murder was consummated, and the people <lb/>
            came in to view the scene, some were killed as guilty by those <lb/>
            who were ignorant of the real actors ; for a report being soon <lb/>
            spread abroad that violence had been offered to Dion, many, <lb/>
            to whom such a deed was detestable, ran together to the spot; <lb/>
            and these persons, prompted by a false suspicion, killed the <note type="footnote"> * The ancients were accustomed, when they wished to devote them­ <lb/>

            innocent as if they had been the delinquents. But as soon <lb/>
            as his death became publicly known, the feeling of the popu­ <lb/>
            lace was wonderfully altered, for those who had called him a <lb/>

            country and the expeller of a tyrant. So suddenly had pity <lb/>
            succeeded to hatred, that they wished to redeem him from <lb/>
            Acheron, if they could, with their own blood. He was there­ <lb/>
            fore honoured with a sepulchral monument in the city, in the <lb/>
            most frequented part of it, after having been interred at the <lb/>
            public expense. He died at the age of about fifty-five years, <lb/>
            four years after he had returned from the Peloponnesus into <lb/>
            Sicily.</p>

            tary tactics; for he was such a leader, that he was not only <lb/>
            comparable to the first commanders of his own time, but no <lb/>
            one even of the older generals could be set above him. He <lb/>
            was much engaged in the field ; he often had the command of <lb/>
            armies; he never miscarried in an undertaking by his own <lb/>
            fault; he was always eminent for invention, and such was his <lb/>
            excellence in it, that he not only introduced much that was <lb/>
            new into the military art, but made many improvements in <lb/>
            what existed before. He altered the arms of the infantry ; <lb/>
            for whereas, before he became a commander, they used very <lb/>
            large shields, short spears, and small swords, he, on the con­ <lb/>
            trary, introduced the pelta instead of the parma* (from which <lb/>
            the infantry were afterwards called peltastæ), that they might <lb/>
            be more active in movements and encounters; he doubled the <lb/>
            length of the spear, and made the swords also longer. He <lb/>
            likewise changed the character of their cuirasses, and gave <lb/>
            them linen ones instead of those of chain-mail and brass ; a <lb/>
            change by which he rendered the soldiers more active; for, <note type="footnote"> * Peltam pro parmd fecit.] The pelta was smaller than the parma, <lb/>
            but both were smaller than the clypeus.-Bos. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="359"/>
            dininishing the weight, he provided what would equally pro <lb/>
            tect the body, and be light.</p>
          <p>II. He made war upon the Thracians, and restored Seuthes, <lb/>
            the ally of the Athenians, to his throne. At Corinth* he <lb/>
            commanded the army with so much strictness, that no troops <lb/>
            in Greece were ever better disciplined, or more obedient to the <lb/>
            orders of their leader; and he brought them to such a habit, <lb/>
            that when the signal for battle was given them by their <lb/>
            general, they would stand so regularly drawn up, without any <lb/>
            trouble on the part of the commander, that they seemed to <lb/>
            have been severally posted by the most skilful captain. With <lb/>
            this army he cut off a mora t of the Lacedæmonians; an <lb/>
            exploit which was highly celebrated through all Greece. In <lb/>
            this war, too, he defeated all their forces a second time, by <lb/>
            which success he obtained great glory.</p>
          <p>Artaxerxes, when he had resolved to make war upon the <lb/>
            king of Egypt,‡ asked the Athenians to allow Iphicrates to be <lb/>
            his general, that he might place him at the head of his army <lb/>
            of mercenaries, the number of whom was twelve thousand. <lb/>
            This force he so instructed in all military discipline, that as <lb/>
            certain Roman soldiers were formerly called Fabians,§ so the <lb/>
            Iphicrateans were in the- highest repute among the Greeks.</p>

            an appearance indicating the commander so that by his very <lb/>
            look he inspired every one with admiration of him. But in <lb/>
            action he was too remiss, and too impatient of continued exer­ <lb/>
            tion, as Theopompus has recorded. Yet he was a good citizen, <lb/>
            and a person of very honourable feelings, as he showed, not <lb/>
            only in other transactions, but also in protecting the children <lb/>
            of Amyntas t the Macedonian ; for Eurydice, the mother of <lb/>
            Perdiccas and Philip, fled with these two boys, after the death <lb/>
            of Amyntas, to Iphicrates, and was secure under his power. <lb/>
            He lived to a good old age, with the feelings of his countrymen <lb/>
            well affected towards him.</p>

            was asked whether he had more regard for his father or his <lb/>
            mother, he replied, " For his mother." As this answer <lb/>
            appeared strange to all who heard it, he added, " I do so with <lb/>
            justice; for my father, as far as was in his power, made me a <lb/>

          <p>I. CHABRIAS the Athenian was also numbered among the <lb/>
            most eminent generals, and performed many acts worthy 01 <lb/>
            record. But of these the most famous is his manoeuvre in <lb/>
            the battle which he fought near Thebes, when he had gone to <lb/>
            the relief of the Bœotians; for in that engagement, when the <lb/>
            great general Agesilaus felt sure of victory, and the mercenary <lb/>
            troops had been put to flight by him, Cbabrias forbade the rest <lb/>
            of his phalanx* to quit their ground, and instructed them to <lb/>
            receive the attack of the enemy with the knee placed firmly <lb/>
            against the shield, and the spear stretched out. Agesilaus, <lb/>
            observing this new plan, did not dare to advance, and called <lb/>
            off his men, as they were rushing forward, with sound of <lb/>
            trumpet. This device was so extolled by fame throughout <lb/>
            Greece, that Chabrias chose to have the statue, which was <lb/>
            erected to him at the public charge by the Athenians in the <lb/>
            forum, made in that posture. Hence it happened that wrestlers, <lb/>
            and other candidates for public applause,! adopted, in the <lb/>
            erection of their statues, those postures in which they had <lb/>
            gained a victory.</p>
          <p>II. Chabrias also, when he was general of the Athenians, <lb/>
            carried on many wars in Europe ; and he engaged in one in <lb/>
            Egypt of his own accord ; for setting out to assist Nectanabis,‡ <lb/>
            he secured him the throne. He performed a similar exploit in <lb/>
            Cyprus, but he was then publicly sent to support Evagoras ; <lb/>
            notdid he return from thence till he had conquered the whole <lb/>
            island; from which achievement the Athenians obtained great <lb/>
            glory.</p>
          <p>In the meantime a war broke out between the Egyptians <lb/>
            and Persians, when the Athenians formed an alliance with <note type="footnote"> * Phalanx is here used as a general term for a body of troops in <lb/>

            Artaxerxes, and the Lacedæmonians with the Egyptians, from <lb/>
            whom their king Agesilaus received a large share of spoil.* <lb/>
            Chabrias, seeing Agesilaus's good fortune, and thinking himself <lb/>
            in no respect inferior to him, set out to assist them of his own <lb/>
            accord, and took the command of the Egyptian fleet, while <lb/>
            Agesilaus held that of the land forces.</p>
          <p>III. In consequence, the officers of the king of Persia sent <lb/>
            deputies to Athens, to complain that Chabrias was warring <lb/>
            against their king on the side of the Egyptians. The <lb/>
            Athenians then prescribed a certain day to Chabrias, before <lb/>
            which if he did not return home, they declared that they <lb/>
            would condemn him to die. On receiving this communication <lb/>
            he returned to Athens; but did not stay there longer than <lb/>
            was necessary; for he did not willingly continue under the <lb/>
            eyes of his countrymen, as he was accustomed to live spIeD. <lb/>
            didly, and to indulge himself too freely to be able to escape <lb/>
            the envy of the populace. For this is a common fault in <lb/>
            great and free states, that envy is the attendant on glory, and <lb/>
            that the people willingly detract from those whom they see <lb/>
            raised above others; nor do the poor contemplate with <lb/>
            patience the lot of others who are grown rich. Chabrias, <lb/>
            therefore, when he could, was generally away from home. Nor <lb/>
            was he the only one that willingly absented himself from <lb/>
            Athens, but almost all their great men did the same, for they <lb/>
            thought that they should be as far removed from envy as they <lb/>
            were distant from their native country. Conon, in conse­ <lb/>
            quence, lived very much in Cyprus, Iphicrates in Thrace, <lb/>
            Timotheus in Lesbos, Chares at Sigeum. Chares, indeed, <lb/>
            differed from the others in conduct and character, but was <lb/>
            nevertheless both distinguished and powerful at Athens. <note type="footnote"> * A quibw magnas prœdas Agesilaus rex eorum faciebat.] Attempts to <lb/>

          <p>IV. Chabrias lost his life in the Social war,* in the following <lb/>
            manner. The Athenians were besieging Chios ; Chabrias was <lb/>
            on board the fleet as a private man, but had more influence <lb/>
            than all who were in command; and the soldiers looked up <lb/>
            to him more than to those who were over them. This cir­ <lb/>
            cumstance hastened his death; for while he was anxious to <lb/>
            be the first to enter the harbour, and ordered the captain to <lb/>
            steer the vessel towards it, he was the occasion of his own <lb/>
            death, since, after he had made his way into it, the other <lb/>
            ships did not follow. Upon which, being surrounded by a <lb/>
            body of the enemy, his ship, while he was fighting with the <lb/>
            utmost bravery, was struck with the beak of one of the enemy's <lb/>
            vessels, and began to sink. Though he might have escaped <lb/>
            from the danger, if he had cast himself into the sea, for the <lb/>
            fleet of the Athenians was at hand to take him up as he <lb/>
            swam, he chose rather to die, than to throw away his arms <lb/>
            and abandon the vessel in which he had sailed. The others <lb/>
            would not act in a similar manner, but gained a place of <lb/>
            safety by swimming. He, on the other hand, thinking an <lb/>
            honourable death preferable to a dishonourable life, was killed <lb/>
            with the weapons of the enemy, while he was fighting hand to <lb/>
            hand with them.</p>

          <p>I. TIMOTHEUS, the son of Conon, a native of Athens, in­ <lb/>
            creased the glory which he inherited from his father by many <lb/>
            excellent qualities of his own; for he was eloquent, active, <lb/>
            persevering, skilled in military affairs, and not less so in <lb/>
            managing those of the state. Many honourable actions of his <lb/>
            are recorded, the following are the most famous. He subdued <lb/>
            the Olynthians and Byzantians by force of arms; he took <lb/>
            Samos, on the siege of which, in a previous war, the Athenians <note type="footnote"> * See Life of I phi crates, c. 3. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="364"/>
            had spent twelve hundred talents. This sum he restored * <lb/>
            tc the people without any expense to them ; for he carried on <lb/>
            a war against Cotys, †and thence brought twelve hundred <lb/>
            talents' worth of spoil into the public treasury. He relieved <lb/>
            Cyzicus ‡ from a siege, he went with Agesilaus to the assistance <lb/>
            of Ariobarzanes; § but while the Lacedæmonians received <lb/>
            ready money from him in requital, he chose rather to have <lb/>
            his countrymen enriched with lands and towns, than to take <lb/>
            that of which he himself might carry a share to his own home; <lb/>
            and he accordingly received from him Crithote || and Sestos.</p>
          <p>II. Being made commander of the fleet, and sailing round <lb/>
            the Peloponnesus, he laid waste Laconia, and defeated its <lb/>
            naval force. He also reduced Corcyra under the power of <lb/>
            the Athenians, and attached to them, as allies, the Epirots <lb/>
            the Athamanians, the Chaonians, and all those nations which <lb/>
            lie on the sea.¶ After this occurrence, the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            desisted from the protracted struggle, and yielded, of their <lb/>
            own accord, the sovereignty at sea to the Athenians, making <lb/>
            peace upon these terms, " that the Athenians should be <lb/>
            commanders by sea." This victory gave so much delight to <lb/>
            the Athenians, that altars were then first publicly erected to <lb/>
            Peace, and a pulvinar. decreed to that goddess. And that <lb/>
            the remembrance of this glorious action might be preserved, <lb/>
            they raised a statue to Timotheus in the forum at the public <note type="footnote"> * Id—restituit.] Many editions, for id, have hanc, sc. pecuniam, but <lb/>

          <p>III. When he was at an advanced age, and had ceased to <lb/>
            hold any office, the Athenians began to be pressed with war on <lb/>
            every side. Samos had revolted; the Hellespont* had <lb/>
            deserted them; Philip of Macedon, then very powerful, was <lb/>
            making many efforts; and in Chares,t who had been opposed <lb/>
            to him, there was not thought to be sufficient defence <lb/>
            Menestheus, the son of Iphicrates, and son-in-law of Timotheus, <lb/>
            was in consequence made commander, and a decree was passed <lb/>
            that he should proceed to take the management of the war. <lb/>
            These two persons, his father and father-in-law, men eminent <lb/>
            in experience and wisdom, were appointed to give him advice,‡ <lb/>
            for there was such force of character in them, that great hopes <lb/>
            were entertained that what had been lost might be recovered by <lb/>
            their means. When they had set out for Samos ; and Chares, <lb/>
            having heard of their approach, was also proceeding thither <lb/>
            with his force, lest anything should appear to be done in his <lb/>
            absence, it happened that, as they drew near the island, a great <lb/>
            storm arose, which the two veteran commanders, thinking it <lb/>
            expedient to avoid, checked the progress of their fleet.§ But <lb/>
            Chares, taking a rash course, would not submit to the advice of <lb/>
            his elders, but, as if success depended on his own vessel, <lb/>
            pushed his way for the point to which he had been steering, and <lb/>
            sent orders to Timotheus and Iphicrates to follow him thither. <lb/>
            But having subsequently mis-managed the affair, and lost <lb/>
            several ships, he returned to the same place || from which he <lb/>
            had come, and despatched a letter to the government at Athens, <lb/>
            saying that it would have been easy for him to take Samos, if <note type="footnote"> * That is, the cities on the Hellespont. </note><note type="footnote"> + Cui oppositus Charm quum esset, non satis in eo prœsidii putabatur.] <lb/>

            he had not been lett unsupported by Timotheus and Iphicrates. <lb/>
            On this charge they were impeached. The people, violent, <lb/>
            auspicious, fickle, and unfavourable to them, recalled them <lb/>
            home ; and they were brought to trial for treason. On this <lb/>
            charge Timotheus was found guilty, and his fine was fixed at a <lb/>
            hundred talents; when, compelled by the hatred of an <lb/>
            ungrateful people, he sought a refuge at Chalets.</p>
          <p>IV. After his death, when the people had repented of the <lb/>
            sentence passed upon him, they took off nine-tenths of the fine, <lb/>
            and ordered that his son Conon should give ten talents to <lb/>
            repair a certain portion of the wall. In this occurrence was <lb/>
            seen the changeableness of fortune; for the grandson was <lb/>
            obliged, to the great scandal of his family, to repair, out of his <lb/>
            own estate, the same walls which his grandfather Conon had <lb/>
            rebuilt with the spoil taken from the enemy.</p>
          <p>Of the temperate and judicious life of Timotheus, though we <lb/>
            could produce a great many proofs, we will be content with one, <lb/>
            from which it may be easily conjectured how dear he was to his <lb/>
            friends. When he was brought to trial, while quite a young <lb/>
            man, at Athens, not only his friends, and others connected <lb/>
            with him by ties of private hospitality, came to give him their <lb/>
            support, but among them also the tyrant Jason,* who at that <lb/>
            time was the most powerful of all men. Jason, though he did <lb/>
            not think himself safe in his own country without guards, came <lb/>
            to Athens unattended, having such value for his guest-friend, <lb/>
            that he chose to hazard his life rather than not stand by <lb/>
            Timotheus when he was contending for his honour.t Yet <lb/>
            Timotheus, under an order from the people, carried on a war <lb/>
            against him afterwards, for he considered the rights of his <lb/>
            country more sacred than those of hospitality.</p>
          <p>This was the last age of Athenian commanders; the age of <lb/>
            Iphicrates, Chabrias, and Timotheus; nor, after their death, <lb/>
            was there any leader ‡ worthy of remembrance in that city. <note type="footnote"> * Jason tyrannus.] He was tyrant of Pherme in Thessaly, and was, as <lb/>

          <p>I. I NOW come to the bravest and wisest man of all the <lb/>
            barbarians, except the two Carthaginians, Hamilcar and <lb/>
            Hannibal.</p>
          <p>I shall say the more concerning this general, because most <lb/>
            of his acts are but little known, and because the undertakings <lb/>
            that were attended with success to him, were accomplished, <lb/>
            not by vastness of force, but by sagacity, in which he sur­ <lb/>
            passed all of that age; and unless the manner of his proceedings <lb/>
            be set forth, his merits cannot be fully understood.</p>
          <p>Datames, son of a father named Camissares, a Carian by <lb/>
            nation, and of a mother a native of Scythia, served first of all <lb/>
            among the soldiers who were guards of the palace to Artax­ <lb/>
            erxes. His father Camissares, having been found undaunted <lb/>
            in fight, active in command, and faithful on many occasions to <lb/>
            the king, was granted as a province that portion of Cilicia <lb/>
            which borders on Cappadocia, and which the Leucosyrians <lb/>
            inhabit.</p>
          <p>Datames first showed what sort of man he was, when <lb/>
            engaged in military service, in the war which the king carried <lb/>
            on against the Cardusii; for in this enterprise, after several <lb/>
            thousands of the king's troops were killed, his exertions proved <lb/>
            of great value. Hence it happened that, as Camissares lost <lb/>
            his life in the war, his father's province was conferred upon <lb/>
            him.</p>
          <p>II. He distinguished himself by equal valour when Auto­ <lb/>
            phradates, by the king's order, made war upon those who had <lb/>
            revolted; for the enemy, even after they had entered the <lb/>
            camp, were put to flight by his effortsand the rest of the <lb/>
            king's army was saved. In consequence of this success, he <lb/>
            began to be appointed over more important affairs. At that <lb/>
             <pb n="368"/>
            time Thyus was prince of Paphlagonia, a man of ancient <lb/>
            family, descended from that Pylæmenes whom Homer states <lb/>
            to have been killed by Patroclus* in the Trojan war. This <lb/>
            prince paid no respect to the king's commands. The king, in <lb/>
            consequence, determined to make war upon him, and gave <lb/>
            the command of the enterprise to Defames, who was a near <lb/>
            relative of the Paphlagonian, for they were sons of a brother <lb/>
            and a sister. Datames, on this account, was desirous, in the <lb/>
            first place, to try every means to bring back his kinsman to <lb/>
            his duty without having recourse to arms. But going to <lb/>
            confer with him without a guard, as he apprehended no <lb/>
            treachery from a friend, he almost lost his life, for Thyus had <lb/>
            resolved to assassinate him secretly. Datames was however <lb/>
            accompanied by his mother, the aunt of the Paphlagonian, who <lb/>
            discovered what was going on, and gave her son warning of it. <lb/>
            Datames escaped the danger by flight, and declared open war <lb/>
            against Thyus, in which, though he was deserted by Ario­ <lb/>
            barzanes, the satrap of Lydia, Ionia, and all Phrygia, he <lb/>
            nevertheless vigorously persevered, and succeeded in takina <lb/>
            Thyus alive with his wife and children.</p>
          <p>III. He then used his utmost efforts that the news of his <lb/>
            success might not reach the king before him, and thus, while <lb/>
            all were still ignorant of it, he arrived at the place where the <lb/>
            king was encamped, and the day after arrayed Thyus, a man <lb/>
            of huge stature, and frightful aspect, being of a black com­ <lb/>
            plexion, and having long hair and a long beard, in a splendid <lb/>
            robe such as the king's satraps used to wear. He adorned <lb/>
            him also with a chain and bracelets of gold, and other royal <lb/>
            ornaments, while he himself was dressed in a coarse thick <lb/>
            cloak,† and rough coat, having a hunter's cap upon his head, <lb/>
            a club in his right hand, and in his left a chain, with which <lb/>
            he drove Thyus secured before him, as if he were bringing <lb/>
            along a wild beast that he had taken. While the people were <lb/>
            all gazing at him, on account of the strangeness of his attire, <lb/>
            and his person being unknown to them, and a great crowd <note type="footnote"> * Pylæmenes was not killed by Patroclus, but by Menelaus; Horn. <lb/>

            was in consequence gathered round him, it happened that <lb/>
            there was somebody in it who knew Thyus, and went off to <lb/>
            tell the king, The king at first did not believe the account, <lb/>
            and therefore sent Pharnabazus to make inquiry. Learning <lb/>
            from him what had been done, he ordered Datames to be <lb/>
            instantly admitted, being extremely delighted both with his <lb/>
            success and the dress of his captive, rejoicing especially that <lb/>
            that eminent prince had fallen into his hands when he scarcely <lb/>
            expected it. He therefore sent Datames, after bestowing <lb/>
            magnificent presents upon him, to the army which was then <lb/>
            assembling, under the command of Pharnabazus and Tithraus <lb/>
            tes, to make war upon Egypt, and directed that he should <lb/>
            have equal authority with them. But as the king afterwards <lb/>
            recalled Pharnabazus, the chief direction of the war was com­ <lb/>
            mitted to Datames.</p>
          <p>IV. As he was raising an army with the utmost diligence, <lb/>
            and preparing to set out for Egypt, a letter was unexpectedly <lb/>
            sent him by the king, desiring him to attack Aspis, who then <lb/>
            held Cataonia, a country which lies above Cilicia, and borders <lb/>
            on Cappadocia. Aspis, occupying a woody country, defended <lb/>
            with fortresses, not only refused to obey the king's orders, but <lb/>
            ravaged the neighbouring provinces, and intercepted what­ <lb/>
            ever was being conveyed to the king. Datames, though he <lb/>
            was far distant from those parts, and was drawn off from a <lb/>
            greater matter, yet thought it necessary to yield to the king's <lb/>
            wish. He therefore went on board a ship with a few brave <lb/>
            followers, thinking (what really happened) that he would <lb/>
            more easily overcome him, when unaware of his approach <lb/>
            and unprepared, than when ready to meet him, though with <lb/>
            ever so great an army. Sailing in this vessel to the coast of <lb/>
            Cilicia, landing there, and marching day and night, he passed <lb/>
            Mount Taurus, and arrived at the part to which he had <lb/>
            directed his course. He inquired where Aspis was, and <lb/>
            learned that he was not far off, and was gone to hunt. <lb/>
            While he was watching for his return, the cause of his <lb/>
            coming became known, and Aspis prepared the Pisidians, and <lb/>
            the attendants that he had with him, to offer resistance. <lb/>
            When Datames heard this, he took up his arms, and ordered <lb/>
            his men to follow him ; he himself, setting spurs to his horse, <lb/>
            rode on to meet the enemy. Aspis, seeing him, from a <lb/>
            distance, advancing upon him, was struck with fear, and, being <note type="footnote"> as </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="370"/>
            deterred from his resolution to resist, delivered himself up. <lb/>
            Datames consigned him in chains to Mithridates, to be con­ <lb/>
            ducted to the king.</p>
          <p>V. While these occurrences were passing, Artaxerxes, re­ <lb/>
            flecting from how important a war, and to how inconsiderable <lb/>
            an enterprize, he had sent the best of his generals, blamed <lb/>
            himself for what he had done, and sent a messenger to the <lb/>
            troops at Ace (not supposing that Datames had yet set out), to <lb/>
            tell him not to quit the army. But before this messenger <lb/>
            arrived at the place to which he was sent, he met upon the road <lb/>
            the party that were leading Aspis.</p>
          <p>Though Datames, by this celerity, gained great favour from <lb/>
            the king, he incurred no less dislike on the part of the courtiers, <lb/>
            because they saw that he alone was more valued than all of <lb/>
            them; and on this account they all conspired to ruin him. <lb/>
            Pandates, the keeper of the king's treasury, a friend to <lb/>
            Datames, sent him an account of this state of things in writing, <lb/>
            in which he told him that “he would be in great peril if any <lb/>
            ill-success should fall out while he commanded in Egypt, for <lb/>
            such was the practice of kings, that they attributed adverse <lb/>
            occurrences to other men, but prosperous ones to their own <lb/>
            good fortune; and hence it happened that they were easily <lb/>
            inclined to the ruin of those under whose conduct affairs were <lb/>
            said to have'been ill-managed; and that he would be in so much <lb/>
            the greater danger as he had those for his bitterest enemies to <lb/>
            whom the king chiefly gave ear." Datames, having read this <lb/>
            letter, after he had arrived at the army at Ace, resolved, as he <lb/>
            was aware that what was written was true, to leave the king's <lb/>
            service. He did nothing, however, that was unworthy of his <lb/>
            honour; for he appointed Mandrocles of Magnesia to command <lb/>
            the army, while he himself went off with his adherents into <lb/>
            Cappadocia, and took possession of Paphlagonia, that bordered <lb/>
            upon it, concealing what his feelings were towards the king. <lb/>
            He then privately made a league with Ariobarzanes, raised a <lb/>
            force, and assigned the fortified towns to be defended by his own <lb/>
            troops.</p>
          <p>VI. But these proceedings, from its being winter, went on <lb/>
            with but little success. He heard that the Pisidians were <lb/>
            raising some forces to oppose him, and sent his son Aridæus <lb/>
            with a detachment against them. The young man fell in battle, <lb/>
            and the father marched away to the scene of his death with but <lb/>
             <pb n="371"/>
            a small number of followers, concealing how great a loss he had <lb/>
            sustained, for he wished to reach the enemy before the report <lb/>
            of his ill-success should become known to his men, lest the <lb/>
            spirits of the soldiers should be depressed by hearing of the <lb/>
            death of his son. He arrived at the spot to which he had <lb/>
            directed his course, and pitched his camp in such a position <lb/>
            that he could neither be surrounded by the superior number of <lb/>
            the enemy, nor be hindered from keeping his forces always <lb/>
            ready to engage. There was with him Mithrobarzanes, his <lb/>
            father-in-law, commander of the cavalry, who, despairing of the <lb/>
            state of his son-in-law's affairs, went over to the enemy. When <lb/>
            Datames heard this, he was sensible that if it should go abroad <lb/>
            among the multitude that he was deserted by a man so <lb/>
            intimately connected with him, it would happen that others <lb/>
            would follow his example. He therefore spread a report <lb/>
            throughout the camp that “Mithrobarzanes had gone off as a <lb/>
            deserter by his direction, in order that, being received as such, <lb/>
            he might the more easily spread destruction among the enemy. <lb/>
            It was not right therefore," he added, " that he should be left <lb/>
            unsupported, but that they ought all to follow without delay, <lb/>
            and, if they did so with spirit, the consequence would be that <lb/>
            their foes would be unable to resist, as they would be cut to <lb/>
            pieces within their ramparts and without." This exhortation <lb/>
            being well received, he led forth his troops, pursued Mithro­ <lb/>
            barzanes, and, almost at the moment that the latter was joining <lb/>
            the enemy,. gave orders for an attack. The Pisidians, sur­ <lb/>
            prised by this new movement, were led to believe that the <lb/>
            deserters were acting with bad faith, and by arrangement with <lb/>
            Datames, in order that, when received into the camp, they <lb/>
            might do them the greater mischief; they therefore attacked <lb/>
            them first. The deserters, as they knew not what was in <lb/>
            agitation, or why it took place, were compelled to fight with <lb/>
            those to whom they had deserted, and to act on the side of <lb/>
            those whom they had quitted ; and, as neither party spared <note type="footnote"> *Qui tantum quod ad hostespervenerat.] This reading is an emenda­ <lb/>

            them, they were quickly cut to pieces. Datames then set upon <lb/>
            the rest of the Pisidians who offered resistance, repelled them <lb/>
            at the first onset, pursued them as they fled, killed a great <lb/>
            number of them, and captured their camp. By this stratagem <lb/>
            he at once both cut off the traitors, and overthrew the enemy, <lb/>
            and turned to his preservation what had been contrived for his <lb/>
            destruction. We have nowhere read, on the part of any <lb/>
            commander, any device more ingeniously conceived than this, <lb/>
            or more promptly executed.</p>
          <p>VII. Yet from such a man as this his eldest son Scismas <lb/>
            deserted, and went over to the king, carrying intelligence of <lb/>
            his fathers defection. Artaxerxes, being startled at this news <lb/>
            (for he was aware that he should have to do with a brave and <lb/>
            active man, who, when he had conceived a project, had courage <lb/>
            to execute it, and was accustomed to think before he attempted <lb/>
            to act), despatched Autophradates into Cappadocia. To pre. <lb/>
            vent this general from entering the country, Datames endea­ <lb/>
            voured to be the first to secure a forest, in which the Gate of <lb/>
            Cilicia* is situate. But he was unable to collect his troops <lb/>
            with sufficient expedition, and being obliged to desist from his <lb/>
            attempt, he took up, with the force which he had got together, <lb/>
            a position of such a nature, that he could neither be sur­ <lb/>
            rounded by the enemy, nor could the enemy pass beyond him <lb/>
            without being incommoded by difficulties on both sides; while, <lb/>
            if he wished to engage with them, the numbers of his oppo­ <lb/>
            nents could not greatly damage his own smaller force.</p>
          <p>VIII. Autophradates, though he was aware of these circum <lb/>
            stances, yet thought it better to fight than to retreat with sc <lb/>
            large an army, or to continue inactive so long in one place. <lb/>
            He had twenty thousand barbarian cavalry, a hundred thou­ <lb/>
            sand infantry, whom they call Cardaces,t and three thousand <lb/>
            slingers of the same class. He had besides eight thousand <lb/>
            Cappadocians, ten thousand Armenians, five thousand Paphla­ <lb/>
            gonians, ten thousand Phrygians, five thousand Lydians, <lb/>
            about three thousand Aspendians and Pisidians, two thousand <lb/>

            from Greece, and a very large number of light-armed troops. <lb/>
            Against this force all Datames's hopes rested on himself and the <lb/>
            nature of his ground, for he had not the twentieth part of his <lb/>
            enemy's numbers. Trusting to himself and his position,­ <lb/>
            therefore, he brought on a battle, and cut off many thousands <lb/>
            of the enemy, while there fell of his own army not more than <lb/>
            a thousand men; on which account he erected a trophy the <lb/>
            next day on the spot where they had fought the day before. <lb/>
            When he had moved his camp from thence, and always, <lb/>
            though inferior in forces, came off victorious in every battle <lb/>
            (for he never engaged but when he had confined his adver. <lb/>
            saries in some defile, an advantage which often happened to <lb/>
            one acquainted with the ground and taking his measures with <lb/>
            skill), Autophradates, seeing that the war was protracted with <lb/>
            more loss to the king than to the enemy, exhorted Datames to <lb/>
            peace and friendship,† so that he might again be received into <lb/>
            favour with the king. Datames, though he saw that peace <lb/>
            would not be faithfully kept, nevertheless accepted the offer of <lb/>
            it, and said that “he would send deputies to Artaxerxes." <lb/>
            Thus the war, which the king had undertaken against Data­ <lb/>
            mes, was ended; and Autophradates retired into Phrygia.</p>
          <p>IX. But the king, as he had conceived an implacable hatred <lb/>
            to Datames, endeavoured, when he found that he could not be <lb/>
            overcome in the field, to cut him off by underhand artifices ; <lb/>
            but most of these he eluded. For instance, when it was <lb/>
            told him that some, who were reckoned in the number of his <lb/>
            friends, were laying a plot for him (concerning whom, a? <lb/>
            their enemies were the informers, he thought that the inti <lb/>
            mation was neither entirely to be believed nor utterly disre­ <lb/>
            garded), he resolved to make trial whether what had been told <lb/>
            him was true or false. He accordingly went forward on the <lb/>
            road on which they had stated that an ambush would be laid <lb/>
            for him ; but he selected a man closely resembling himself in <note type="footnote"> gested that we should read, with a slight alteration, Caspianorum, <lb/>

            person and stature, gave him his own attire, and ordered him <lb/>
            to ride on in that part of the line where he himself had <lb/>
            been accustomed to go, while Datames himself, in the equip­ <lb/>
            ments and dress of a common soldier, prepared to march <lb/>
            among his own body-guard. The men in ambuscade, as soon <lb/>
            as the party reached the spot where they were stationed, being <lb/>
            deceived by the place and dress, made an assault upon him <lb/>
            who had been substituted for Datames. But Datames had <lb/>
            previously directed those among whom he was marching, to <lb/>
            be ready to do what they should see him do. He, as soon as <lb/>
            he saw the conspirators collecting in a body, hurled his darts <lb/>
            among them, and, as all the rest did the same, they fell down <lb/>
            dead before they could reach him whom they meant to attack.</p>
          <p>X. Yet this man, crafty as he was, was at last ensnared by <lb/>
            a device of Mithridates, the son of Ariobarzanes ; for Mithri­ <lb/>
            dates promised the king that he would kill Datames, if the <lb/>
            king would allow him to do with impunity whatever he wished, <lb/>
            and would give him a pledge to that effect with his right hand <lb/>
            after the manner of the Persians. When he received this <lb/>
            pledge sent him by the king,. he prepared a force, and though <lb/>
            at a distance, made a league with Datames, ravaged the king's <lb/>
            provinces, stormed his fortresses, and carried off a great quan­ <lb/>
            tity of spoil, part of which he divided among his men, and <lb/>
            part he sent to Datames, putting into his hands, in like manner, <lb/>
            many strong-holds. By pursuing this course for a long time, <lb/>
            he made Datames believe that he had undertaken an everlast­ <lb/>
            ing war against the king, while notwithstanding (lest he should <lb/>
            raise in him any suspicion of treachery), he neither sought a <lb/>
            conference with him, nor showed any desire to come into his <lb/>
            sight. Thus, though keeping at a distance, he maintained <lb/>
            friendship with him; but so that they seemed to be bound to <lb/>
            one another, not by mutual kindnesses, but by the common <lb/>
            hatred which they had conceived towards the king.</p>
          <p>XI. When he thought that he had sufficiently established <lb/>
            this notion, he gave intimation to Datames that it was time for <lb/>
            greater armies to be raised, and an attack to be made on <lb/>
            the king himself; and that, with reference to this sub­ <lb/>
            ject, he might, if he pleased, come to a conference with him <note type="footnote"> * A rege missam.] These words are wanting in some editions. The <lb/>
            king presented his right hand to some person, in order that thai <lb/>
            person might present his own to Mithridates in the king'a name. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="375"/>
            in any place that he might choose. The proposal being <lb/>
            accepted, a time was fixed for the conference, and a place in <lb/>
            which they were to meet. To this spot Mithridates came some <lb/>
            days previously, in company with a person in whom he had <lb/>
            the greatest confidence, and buried swords in several different <lb/>
            places, carefully marking each spot. On the day of the con­ <lb/>
            ference, each of them brought people to examine the place, <lb/>
            and to search Datames and Mithridates themselves. They <lb/>
            then met, and after they had spent some time in conference, <lb/>
            and parted in different directions, and Datames was some <lb/>
            distance off, Mithridate , before he went back to his attendants <lb/>
            (lest he should excite any suspicion), returned to the same <lb/>
            place, and sat down, as if he wished to rest from weariness, <lb/>
            on one of the spots in which a sword had been concealed, <lb/>
            and, at the same time, called back Datames, pretending that <lb/>
            he had forgotten something at their conference. In the mean <lb/>
            time he drew out the sword that was hid, and concealed it, un­ <lb/>
            sheathed, under his garment, and observed to Datames, as he <lb/>
            was returning, that he had noticed, when going off, that a <lb/>
            certain place, which was in sight, was suitable for pitching a <lb/>
            camp. While he was pointing this out with his finger, and the <lb/>
            other was looking towards it, he ran him through, as his back <lb/>
            was turned, with the sword, and put an end to his life before <lb/>
            any one could come to his assistance. Thus a man who had <lb/>
            gained the mastery over many by prudence, over none by <lb/>
            treachery, was ensnared by pretended friendship.</p>

          <p>I.EPAMINONDAS was the son of Polymnis, ; ndwas born at <lb/>
            Thebes. Before we proceed to write of him, the following <lb/>
            caution seems necessary to be given to our readers; that ej <lb/>
             <pb n="376"/>
            should not confound the customs of other nations with thai! <lb/>
            own, or think that those things which appear unimportant to <lb/>
            themselves must be equally so to others. We know that skill <lb/>
            in music, according to our habits, is foreign to the character of <lb/>
            any eminent personage ; and that to dance is accounted dispa­ <lb/>
            raging to the character;* while all such accomplishments <lb/>
            among the Greeks, are regarded both as pleasing and as <lb/>
            worthy of admiration.</p>
          <p>But as we wish to draw a correct picture of the habits <lb/>
            and life of Epaminondas, we seem called upon to omit nothing <lb/>
            that may tend to illustrate it. We shall therefore speak in <lb/>
            the first place of his birth; we shall then show in what accom­ <lb/>
            plishments, and by whom, he was instructed; next we shall <lb/>
            touch upon his manners and intellectual endowments, and <lb/>
            whatever other points in his character may deserve notice ; <lb/>
            and lastly on his great actions, which are more regarded by <lb/>
            many than all the best qualities of the mind.†</p>
          <p>II. He was the son, then, of the father whom we named, <lb/>
            and was of an honourable family, though left poor by his an­ <lb/>
            cestors ; but he was so well educated that no Theban was <lb/>
            more so; for he was taught to play upon the harp, and to sing <lb/>
            to the sound of its strings, by Dionysius, who was held in no <lb/>
            less honour among musicians than Damon or Lamprus,‡whose <lb/>
            names are well known ; to play on the flutes § by Olympiodo­ <lb/>
            rus; and to dance by Calliphron. For his instructor in <lb/>
            philosophy he had Lysis ||of Tarentum, a Pythagorean, to <lb/>
            whom he was so devoted that, young as he was, be preferred <note type="footnote"> * In vitiis poni ] “Is accounted among disparagements, disgraces, or <lb/>

            thesociety of a grave and austere old man * before that of all <lb/>
            these of his own age ; nor did he part with him until he <lb/>
            so far excelled his fellow students in learning, that it might <lb/>
            easily be perceived he would in like manner excel them all <lb/>
            in other pursuits. These acquirements, according to our <lb/>
            habits, are trifling, and rather to be despised ; t but in Greece, <lb/>
            at least in former times, they were a great subject for praise. <lb/>
            After he grew up, and began to apply himself to gymnastic <lb/>
            exercises, he studied not so much to increase the strength, as <lb/>
            the agility, of his body; for he thought that strength <lb/>
            suited the purposes of wrestlers, but that agility con­ <lb/>
            duced to excellence in war. He used to exercise himself <lb/>
            very much, therefore, in running and wrestling, as long as ‡ <lb/>
            lie could grapple, and contend standing, with his adversary. <lb/>
            But he spent most of his labour on martial exercises.</p>
          <p>III. To the strength of body thus acquired were added <lb/>
            many good qualities of the mind ; for he was modest, prudent, <lb/>
            grave, wisely availing himself of opportunities, skilled in war, <lb/>
            brave in action, and possessed of remarkable courage ; he was <lb/>
            so great a lover of truth, that he would not tell a falsehood <lb/>
            even in jest; he was also master of his passions, gentle in <lb/>
            disposition, and patient to a wonderful degree, submitting to <lb/>
            wrong, not only from the people, but from his own friends ; <lb/>
            he was a remarkable keeper of secrets, a quality which is some­ <lb/>
            times not less serviceable than to speak eloquently; and he was <lb/>
            an attentive listener to others, because he thought that by this <lb/>
            means knowledge was most easily acquired. Whenever he came <lb/>
            into a company, therefore, in which a discussion was going on <lb/>
            concerning government, or a conversation was being held on any <lb/>
            point of philosophy, he never went away till the discourse was <lb/>
            brought to its conclusion. He bore poverty so easily, that he <lb/>
            received nothing from the state but glory. He did not avail <lb/>
            himself of the means of his friends to maintain himself; but <lb/>
            he often used his credit to relieve others, to such a degree that <note type="footnote"> * Tristem et severum senem in familiaritate antepossuerit.] " He <lb/>
            preferred a grave and austere old man in familiarity,” i. e. as an <lb/>
            associate. </note><note type="footnote"> t Levia et potiuscontemnenda.] The study of philosophy, at least in <lb/>
            the time of Nepos, was not numbered by the Romans among despica­ <lb/>
            ble pursuits. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡Ad eum finem quoad, &amp;c;] Ad ewr finem, as Bos observes, is the <lb/>

             <pb n="378"/>
            it might be thought all things were in common between him <lb/>
            and his friends ; for when any one of his countrymen had been <lb/>
            taken by the enemy, or when the marriageable daughter of <lb/>
            a friend could not be married for want of fortune, he used to <lb/>
            call a council of his friends, and to prescribe how much each <lb/>
            should give according to his means ; and when he had made <lb/>
            up the sum required, he brought the man who wanted it to <lb/>
            those who contributed, and made them pay it to the person <lb/>
            himself, in order that he, into whose hands the sum passed, <lb/>
            might know to whom he was indebted, and how much to each.</p>
          <p>IV. His indifference to money was put to the proof by <lb/>
            Diomedon of Cyzicus; for he, at the request of Artaxerxes, <lb/>
            had undertaken to bribe Epaminondas. He accordingly came <lb/>
            to Thebes with a large sum in gold, and, by a present of five <lb/>
            talents, brought over Micythus, a young man for whom <lb/>
            Epaminondas had then a great affection, to further his views. <lb/>
            Micythus went to Epaminondas, and told him the cause of <lb/>
            Diomedon's coming. But Epaminondas, in the presence of <lb/>
            Diomedon, said to him, " There is no need of money in the <lb/>
            matter; for if what the king desires is for the good of the <lb/>
            Thebans, I am ready to do it for nothing; but if otherwise, he <lb/>
            has not gold and silver enough to move me, for I would not <lb/>
            accept the riches of the whole world in exchange for my love <lb/>
            for my country. At you, who have made trial of me without <lb/>
            knowing my character, and have thought me like yourself, I do <lb/>
            not wonder ; and I forgive you ; but quit the city at once, <lb/>
            lest you should corrupt others though you have been unable to <lb/>
            corrupt me. You, Mycithus, give Diomedon his money back; <lb/>
            or, unless you do so immediately, I shall give you up to the <lb/>
            magistrates." Diomedon entreating that he might be allowed <lb/>
            to depart in safety, and carry away with him what he had <lb/>
            brought, " That," he replied, “I will grant you, and not for <lb/>
            your sake, but for my own, lest any one, if your money should <lb/>
            be taken from you, should say that what I would not receive <lb/>
            when offered me, had come into my possession after being <lb/>
            taken out of yours." Epaminondas then asking Diomedon <lb/>
            “ whither he wished to be conducted," and Diomedon having <lb/>
            answered, " To Athens," he gave him a guard in order that he <lb/>
            might reach that city in safety. Nor did he, indeed, think <lb/>
            that precaution sufficient, but also arranged, with the aid of <lb/>
            Chabrias the Athenian, of whom we have spoken above, that <lb/>
             <pb n="379"/>
            he should embark without molestation. Of his freedom from <lb/>
            covetousness this will be a sufficient proof. We might indeed <lb/>
            produce a great number; but brevity must be studied, as we <lb/>
            have resolved to comprise, in this single volume, the lives of <lb/>
            several eminent men, whose biographies many writers before <lb/>
            us have related at great length.*</p>
          <p>V. He was also an able speaker, so that no Theban was a <lb/>
            match for him in eloquence ; nor was his language less pointed <lb/>
            in brief replies than elegant in a continued speech. He had <lb/>
            for a traducer, and opponent in managing the government, a <lb/>
            certain Meneclidas, also a native of Thebes,t a man well <lb/>
            skilled in speaking, at least for a Theban, for in that people is <lb/>
            found more vigour of body than of mind. He, seeing that <lb/>
            Epaminondas was distinguished in military affairs, used to <lb/>
            advise the Thebans to prefer peace to war, in order that his <lb/>
            services as a general might not be required. Epaminondas in <lb/>
            consequence said to him, " You deceive your countrymen with <lb/>
            words, in dissuading them from war, since under the name of <lb/>
            peace you are bringing upon them slavery; for peace is pro­ <lb/>
            cured by war, and they, accordingly, who would enjoy it long, <lb/>
            ought to be trained to war. If therefore, my countrymen, you <lb/>
            wish to be leaders of Greece, you must devote yourselves to <lb/>
            the camp, not to the palæstra. ”‡ When this Meneclidas also <lb/>
            upbraided him with having no children, and with not having <lb/>
            taken a wife, and, above all, with presumption in thinking <lb/>

          <p>VI. When Epaminondas went to the public assembly of <lb/>
            the Arcadians, to request them to join in alliance with the <lb/>
            Thebans and Argives, and Callistratus, the ambassador from <lb/>
            the Athenians, who excelled all men of that day in eloquence, <lb/>
            begged of them, on the other hand, rather to unite in alliance <lb/>
            with Athens, and uttered many invectives against the Thebans <lb/>
            and Argives, and among them made this remark, " that the <lb/>
            Arcadians ought to observe what sort of citizens each city had <lb/>
            produced, from whom they might form a judgment of the rest; <lb/>
            for that Orestes and Alcmæon, murderers of their mothers, <lb/>
            were Argives, and that Œdipus, who, when he had killed his <lb/>
            father, had children by his mother, was born at Thebes." <lb/>
            Upon this,* Epaminondas, in his reply, when he had done <lb/>
            speaking as to other points, and had come to those two grounds <lb/>
            of reproach, said that " he wondered at the simplicity of the <lb/>
            Athenian rhetorician, who did not consider that those persons, <lb/>
            to whom he had alluded, were born innocent, and that, after <lb/>
            lhaving been guilty of crimes at home, and having in conse­ <lb/>
            quence been banished from their country, they had been <lb/>
            received by the Athenians." t</p>
          <p>But his eloquence shone most at Sparta (when he was <lb/>
            ambassador before the battle of Leuctra), ‡ where, when the <lb/>
            ambassadors from all the allies had met, Epaminondas, in a full <lb/>
            assembly of the embassies, so clearly exposed the tyranny of <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians, that he shook their power by that speech <lb/>
            not less than by the battle of Leuctra; for he was at that <note type="footnote"> * Hîc.] Some read huic, " to him." </note><note type="footnote"> t The argument of Epaminondas, in these observations, is this, re­ <lb/>
            ferring properly only to Orestes and Œdipus: that they were born, it <lb/>
            must be granted, the one at Argos, and the other at Thebes, but that, <lb/>
            as they were born innocent, neither of those cities can be blamed <lb/>
            n-erely for having been their birth-place; after they were polluted with <lb/>
            crimes, however, and were in consequence expelled from their native <lb/>

            endure wrongs from his countrymen, because he thought it <lb/>
            species of impiety to show resentment towards his country <lb/>
            there are the following proofs. When the Thebans, from <lb/>
            some feeling of displeasure towards him, refused to place him <lb/>
            at the head of the army,. and a leader was chosen that <lb/>
            was ignorant of war, by whose mismanagement that great <lb/>
            multitude of soldiers was brought to such a condition that all <lb/>
            were alarmed for their safety, as they were confined within a <lb/>
            narrow space and blocked up by the enemy, the energy of <lb/>
            Epaminondas began to be in request (for he was there as a <lb/>
            privatet among the soldiers), and when they desired aid from <lb/>
            him, he showed no recollection of the affront that had been <lb/>
            put upon him, but brought the army, after releasing it from <lb/>
            the blockade, safely home. Nor did he act in this manner <lb/>
            once only, but often; ‡ but the most remarkable instance was, <lb/>
            when he had led an army into the Peloponnesus against the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians, and had two joined in command with him, <lb/>
            of whom one was Pelopidas, a man of valour and activity ;— <lb/>
            on this occasion, when, through the accusations of their <lb/>
            enemies, they had all fallen under the displeasure of their <lb/>
            countrymen, and their commission was in consequence taken <lb/>
            from them, and other commanders came to take their place, <lb/>
            Epaminondas did not obey the order of the people, and <lb/>
            persuaded his colleagues to follow his example, continuing to <lb/>
            prosecute the war which he had undertaken, for he saw that, <lb/>
            unless he did so, the whole army would be lost through the <lb/>
            incautiousness and ignorance of its leaders. But there was <lb/>
            a law at Thebes, which punished any one with death who <lb/>
            retained his command longer than was legally appointed. <lb/>
            Epaminondas, however, as he saw that this law had been <lb/>
            made for the purpose of preserving the state, was unwilling to <note type="footnote"> * This was the army that was sent into Thessaly to rescue Pelopidas <lb/>

            impeached for this offence, and he gave them leave to lay all <lb/>
            the blame upon him, and to maintain that it was through his <lb/>
            means that they did not obey the law. They being freed <lb/>
            from danger by this defence, nobody thought that Epaminondas <lb/>
            would make any reply, because, as was supposed, he would <lb/>
            have nothing to say. But he stood forward on the trial, <lb/>
            denied nothing of what his adversaries laid to his charge, and <lb/>
            admitted the truth of all that his colleagues had stated; nor <lb/>
            did he refuse to submit to the penalty of the law; but he re­ <lb/>
            quested of his countrymen one favour, namely, that they would <lb/>
            inscribe in their judicial record of the sentence passed upon <lb/>
            him, † " Epaminondas was punished by the Thebans with death, <lb/>
            because he obliged them to overthrow the Lacedaemonians at <lb/>
            Leuctra, whom, before he was general, none of the Bœotians <lb/>
            durst look upon in the field, and because he not only, by one <lb/>
            battle, rescued Thebes from destruction, but also secured liberty <lb/>
            for all Greece, and brought the power of both people to such a <lb/>
            condition, that the Thebans attacked Sparta, and the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians were content if they could save their lives ; nor did <lb/>
            he cease to prosecute the war, till, after settling Messene,t he <lb/>
            shut up Sparta with a close siege." When he had said <lb/>
            this, there burst forth a laugh from all present, with much <lb/>
            merriment, and no one of the judges ventured to pass sentence <note type="footnote"> * Collegæ ejus.] His colleagues and himself. </note><note type="footnote"> t In periculo suo.] The word periculum, in this passage, greatly per­ <lb/>
            plexed the old commentators; no one could find any satisfactory sense <lb/>
            for it; and various conjectures were offered as to a substitute for it. <lb/>
            At last Gebhard suggested that the passage might be interpreted <lb/>
            " Epaminondam petiisse, ut in actis illis, in quibus suum periculum ad <lb/>
            memoriam notetur, talia inscriberent," so that periculum, in his <lb/>
            opinion, would be the same as " adnotatio sive commemoratio periculi <lb/>
            illius in tabulis publicis," the record of his periculum in the public <lb/>
            registers. Schoppius, Verisim. iv. 18, went farther, and said that <lb/>
            periculum signified " libellum sive annalem publicum." This interpre­ <lb/>
            tation was adopted by Bos and Fischer, and subsequently by Bremi <lb/>
            and others, and is approved by Gesner in his Thesaurus sub voce. <lb/>

            upon him. Thus he came off from this trial for life with the <lb/>
            greatest glory.</p>
          <p>IX. When, towards the close of his career, he was corn <lb/>
            mander at Mantinea, and, pressing very boldly upon the <lb/>
            enemy with his army in full array, was recognized by the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians, they directed their efforts in a body against <lb/>
            him alone, because they thought the salvation of their country <lb/>
            depended upon his destruction, nor did they fall back, until, <lb/>
            after shedding much blood, and killing many of the enemy, <lb/>
            they saw Epaminondas himself, while fighting most valiantly, <lb/>
            fall wounded with a spear hurled from a distance. By his fall <lb/>
            the Bœotians were somewhat disheartened; yet they did not <lb/>
            quit the field till they had put to flight those opposed to them. <lb/>
            As for Epaminondas himself, when he found that he had <lb/>
            received a mortal wound, and also that if he drew out the iron <lb/>
            head of the dart, which had stuck in his body, he would <lb/>
            instantly die, he kept it in until it was told him that " the <lb/>
            Bœotians were victorious." When he heard these words, he <lb/>
            said "I have lived long enough; for I die unconquered." <lb/>
            The iron head being then extracted, he immediately died.</p>
          <p>X. He was never married; and when he was blamed on <lb/>
            this account (as he would leave no children*) by Pelopidas, <lb/>
            who had a son of bad character, and who said that he, in this <lb/>
            respect, but ill consulted the interest of his country, " Beware," <lb/>
            he replied, " lest you should consult it worse, in being about <lb/>
            to leave behind you a son of such a reputation. But neither <lb/>
            can I," he added, " want issue; for I leave behind me a <lb/>
            daughter, the battle of Leuctra, that must of necessity not <lb/>
            only survive me, but must be immortal."</p>
          <p>At the time when the Theban exiles, under the leadership <lb/>
            of Pelopidas, possessed themselves of Thebes, and expelled <lb/>

            nondas, as long as the slaughter of the citizens continued, <lb/>
            confined himself to his own house, for he would neither defend <lb/>

            that Thebes, as well before Epaminondas was born, as after <lb/>
            his death, was always subject to some foreign power,! but <lb/>
            that, as long as he held the reigns of government, it was the <lb/>
            head of all Greece. Hence it may be understood, that one <lb/>
            man was of more efficacy than the whole people.</p>

            who. the better to withstand the opposite faction, favoured the <lb/>
            interest of the Lacedæmonians,) of the citadel of Thebes, <lb/>
            which is called the Cadmea,* and this he did of his own <lb/>
            private determination, not from any public resolution of his <lb/>
            countrymen. For this act the Lacedæmonians removed him <lb/>
            from his command of the army, and fined him a sum of money, <lb/>
            but did not show the more inclination, on that account, to <lb/>
            restore the citadel to the Thebans, because, as enmity had <lb/>
            arisen between them, they thought it better that they <lb/>
            should be under a check than left at liberty; for, after the <lb/>
            Peloponnesian war was ended, and Athens subdued, they <lb/>
            supposed that the contest must be between them and the <lb/>
            Thebans, and that they were the only people who would <lb/>
            venture to make head against them. With this belief they <lb/>
            committed the chief posts to their own friends, while they <lb/>
            partly put to death, and partly banished, the leading men of the <lb/>
            opposite party; and amongst them Pelopidas, of whom we have <lb/>
            begun to write, was expelled from his country.</p>
          <p>II. Almost all these exiles had betaken themselves to <lb/>
            Athens, not that they might live in idleness, but that, whatever <lb/>
            opportunity chance should first offer, they might avail them­ <lb/>
            selves of it to regain their country.t As soon, therefore, as it <lb/>
            seemed time for action, they, in concert with those who held <lb/>
            similar views at Thebes, fixed on a day for cutting off their <lb/>
            enemies and delivering their country, and made choice of that <lb/>
            very day on which the chief magistrates were accustomed to <lb/>
            meet at a banquet together. Great exploits have been often <lb/>
            achieved with no very numerous forces, but assuredly never <lb/>
            before was so great a power overthrown from so small a <lb/>
            beginning. For, out of those who had been banished, twelve <lb/>
            young men (there not being in all more than a hundred who <lb/>
            were willing to encounter so great a danger,) agreed to attempt <lb/>
            the enterprise; and by this small number the power of the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians was overcome; for these youths made war on <lb/>
            that occasion, not more upon the faction of their adversaries than <lb/>
            upon the Spartans, who were lords of Greece, and whose <note type="footnote"> * See Epaminondas, c. 10. </note><note type="footnote"> t Ut quemque ex proximo <unclear>woam</unclear> fors obtulisset, co patriam recuperare <lb/>

          <p>These twelve, then, whose leader was Pelopidas, quitting <lb/>
            Athens in the day-time, with a view to reach Thebes when the <lb/>
            sky was obscured by evening, set out with hunting dogs, carrying <lb/>
            nets in their hands, and in the dress of countrymen, in order <lb/>
            that they might accomplish their journey with less suspicion. <lb/>
            Having arrived at the very time that they had desired, they <lb/>

            be unconnected with the subject before us, † how great mischiet <lb/>
            excessive confidence is wont to produce; for it soon came to the <lb/>
            ears of the Theban magistrates that some of the exiles had <lb/>
            entered the city, but this intelligence, being intent upon their <lb/>
            wine and luxuries, they so utterly disregarded, that they did not <lb/>
            take the trouble even to inquire about so important a matter. <lb/>
            Another circumstance was added, too, which may show their <lb/>
            folly in a more remarkable light. A letter was brought from <lb/>
            Athens by Archias the hierophant, ‡ to Archias, who then held <lb/>
            the chief post at Thebes, in which a full account had been <lb/>
            written concerning the expedition of the exiles. This letter <lb/>
            being delivered to Archias as he was reclining at the banquet, <lb/>
            he, thrusting it under the bolster, sealed as it was, said," put <lb/>
            off serious matters till to-morrow." But those revellers, when <lb/>
            the night was far advanced, and they were overcome with wine, <lb/>
            were all put to death by the exiles under the command of <lb/>
            Pelopidas. Their object being thus effected, and the common <lb/>
            people being summoned to take arms and secure their liberty, <lb/>
            not only those who were in the city, but also others from all <lb/>
            parts out of the country, flocked together to join them; they <lb/>
            then expelled the garrison of the Lacedæmonians from the <lb/>
            citadel, and delivered their country from thraldom. The <note type="footnote"> * Tempus et dies.] Charon had not only settled the day, but the <lb/>

            promoters of the seizure of the Cadmea they partly put to <lb/>
            death, and partly sent into exile.</p>
          <p>IV. During this period of turbulence, Epaminondas, as we <lb/>
            have already observed, remained quiet, so long as the struggle <lb/>
            was between fellow-citizens, in his own house. The glory of <lb/>
            delivering Thebes, therefore, belongs wholly to Pelopidas; <lb/>
            almost all his other honours were gained in conjunction with <lb/>
            Epaminondas. In the battle of Leuctra, where Epaminondas <lb/>
            was commander-in-chief, Pelopidas was leader of a select <lb/>
            body of troops, which were the first to bear down the phalanx <lb/>
            of the Spartans. He was present with him, too, in all his <lb/>
            dangers. When he attacked Sparta, he commanded one wing <lb/>
            of the army; and, in order that Messene might be sooner <lb/>
            restored,* he went ambassador to Persia. He was, indeed, <lb/>
            the second of the two great personages at Thebes, but second <lb/>
            only in such a way that he approached very near to Epami­ <lb/>
            nondas.</p>
          <p>V. Yet he had to struggle with adverse fortune. He lived <lb/>
            in exile, as we have shown, in the early part of his life; and, <lb/>
            when he sought to bring Thessaly under the power of the <lb/>
            Thebans, and thought that he was sufficiently protected by the <lb/>
            law of embassies, which used to be held sacred by all nations, <lb/>
            he was seized, together with Ismenias, by Alexander, tyrant of <lb/>
            Pherse, and thrown into prison. Epaminondas, making war <lb/>
            upon Alexander, restored him to liberty. But after this <lb/>
            occurrence, he could never be reconciled in feeling to him by <lb/>
            whom he had been unjustly treated. He therefore persuaded <lb/>
            the Thebans to go to the relief of Thessaly, and to expel its <lb/>
            tyrants. The chief command in the expedition being given to <lb/>
            him, and he having gone thither with an army, he did not <lb/>
            hesitate to come to a battle the moment he saw the enemy. <lb/>
            In the encounter, as soon as he perceived Alexander, he <lb/>
            spurred on his horse, in a fever of rage, to attack t h and, <lb/>
            separating too far from his men, was killed by a shower of <lb/>
            darts. This happened when victory was in his favour, for the <lb/>
            troops of the tyrant had already given way. Such being the <lb/>
            event, all the cities of Thessaly honoured Pelopidas, after his <lb/>
            death, with golden crowns and brazen statues, and presented <lb/>
            his children with a large portion of land.. : <note type="footnote"> it See Epaminondas, c. 8. </note> <note type="footnote"> C C 2 </note> <pb n="388"/>

          <p>AGESILAUS the Lacedæmonian has been praised not only <lb/>
            by other writers, but, above all, by Xenophon, the disciple o. <lb/>
            Socrates, for he treated Xenophon as an intimate friend.</p>
          <p>In his early days he had a dispute with Leotychides, his <lb/>
            brother's son, about the throne; for it was a custom handed <lb/>
            down among the Lacedæmonians from their ancestors, that they <lb/>
            should always have two kings, in name rather than power, of <lb/>
            the two families of Procles and Eurysthenes, who were the <lb/>
            first kings of Sparta, of the progeny of Hercules. It was not <lb/>
            lawful for a king to be made out of one of these families <lb/>
            instead of the other; each of the two, therefore, maintained <lb/>
            its order of succession. Regard was had, in the first place, <lb/>
            to the eldest of the sons of him who died while on the throne; <lb/>
            but if he had left no male issue, the choice then fell on him <lb/>
            who was next of kin. King Agis, the brother of Agesilaus, <lb/>
            had recently died, and had left a son named Leotychides, <lb/>
            whom, during his life, he had not acknowledged, but, at his <lb/>
            death, had declared to be his. Leotychides contended for the <lb/>
            royal dignity with his uncle Agesilaus, but did not obtain what <lb/>
            he sought, for Agesilaus was preferred through the interest of <lb/>
            Lysander, a man, as we have already stated, of a factious <lb/>
            character, and at that time of great influence.</p>
          <p>II. Agesilaus, as soon as he got possession of the throne, <lb/>
            solicited the Lacedæmonians to send an army into Asia, and <lb/>
            make war upon the king of Persia, assuring them that it was <lb/>
            better to fight in Asia than in Europe; for a rumour had gone <lb/>
            abroad that Artaxerxes was equipping a fleet, and raising land <lb/>
            forces, to send into Greece. Permission being granted him, <lb/>
            he exerted so much expedition, that he arrived in Asia with <lb/>
            his troops before the king's satraps knew that he had set out; <lb/>
            hence it happened that he surprised them all unprepared, and <lb/>
             <pb n="389"/>
            expecting nothing of the kind. But as soon as Tissaphernes, <lb/>
            who had the chief authority among the royal satraps, heard of <lb/>
            his arrival, he begged a truce of the Spartan, on pretence that <lb/>
            he would try to effect an agreement between the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians and the king, but in reality to gain time for collecting <lb/>
            troops ; and he obtained a truce for three months. Each of <lb/>
            them, however, took an oath to observe the truce without <lb/>
            fraud; to which engagement Agesilaus adhered with the <lb/>
            greatest honour; but Tissaphernes, on the other hand, did <lb/>
            nothing but make preparations for war. Though Agesilaus <lb/>
            became aware of his proceedings, he still kept his oath, and <lb/>
            said that " he was a great gainer by doing so, for Tissaphernes, <lb/>
            by his perjury, both alienated men from his interest, and made <lb/>
            the gods angry with him; while he, by being faithful to his <lb/>
            obligation, produced confidence among his troops, as they felt <lb/>
            that the power of the gods was on their side, and that men <lb/>
            were rendered greater friends to them, because they were <lb/>
            accustomed to favour those whom they saw keeping faith."</p>
          <p>III. When the period of the truce was expired, the bar­ <lb/>
            barian, not doubting that as he had many residences in Caria, <lb/>
            and as that province was then thought by far the richest in <lb/>
            Asia, the enemy would direct their attacks on that quarter <lb/>
            especially, assembled his whole force on that side. But <lb/>
            Agesilaus turned into Phrygia, and laid waste the country <lb/>
            before Tissaphernes could make a movement in any direction. <lb/>
            After enriching his men with abundance of plunder, he led <lb/>
            back his army to Ephesus to winter, and erecting forges for arms <lb/>
            there, made preparations for war with great industry. That <lb/>
            his soldiers might be armed with greater care, too, and <lb/>
            equipped with more display, he proposed rewards, with which <lb/>
            those were to be presented whose efforts to that end should <lb/>
            be remarkably distinguished He pursued the same course <lb/>
            with regard to different kinds of exercises, so as to honour <lb/>
            with valuable gifts those who excelled others in them. By <lb/>
            this means he succeeded in getting an army most admirably <lb/>
            accoutred and trained.</p>
          <p>When he thought it time to draw his troops out of winter <lb/>
            quarters, he saw that if he openly declared in what direction <lb/>
            he was going to march, the enemy would not give credit to his <lb/>
            statement, but would occupy other parts with their forces, <lb/>
            not doubting that be would do something quite different from <lb/>
             <pb n="390"/>
            what he said. Agesilaus, accordingly, giving out that be <lb/>
            would march for Sardis, Tissaphemes felt convinced that <lb/>
            Caria must again be defended. When his expectation deceived <lb/>
            him in the matter, and he found himself outwitted by his <lb/>
            adversary's shrewdness, he hastened to protect his dependants, <lb/>
            but too late, for, when he arrived, Agesilaus had taken many <lb/>
            places, and secured abundance of spoil.</p>
          <p>The Lacedæmonian king, seeing that the enemy were <lb/>
            superior to him in cavalry, never gave them an opportunity of <lb/>
            attacking him in the plains, but engaged them in those parts <lb/>
            in which infantry would be of greater service. As often as <lb/>
            he came to a battle, therefore, he routed forces of the enemy <lb/>
            far more numerous than his own; and he so conducted <lb/>
            himself in Asia that he was in the judgment of every one <lb/>
            accounted superior to his opponent.</p>
          <p>IV. While he was thinking of marching into Persia, and <lb/>
            attacking the king himself, a messenger came to him from <lb/>
            home, by order of the Ephori, to acquaint him that the <lb/>
            Athenians and Bœotians had declared war against the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians, and that he should therefore not delay to return. <lb/>
            In this juncture, is dutifulness to his country is not less to <lb/>
            be admired than his merit in war, for though he was at the <lb/>
            head of a victorious army, and felt assured, to the utmost, of <lb/>
            becoming master of the kingdom of Persia, he obeyed the <lb/>
            orders of the absent magistrates with as much respect as if he <lb/>
            had been a private person in the comitium. at Sparta. <lb/>
            Would that our generals had followed his example ! But let <lb/>
            us proceed with our subject. Agesilaus preferred an honour­ <lb/>
            able name to the most powerful empire, and thought it much <lb/>
            more glorious to obey the laws of his country than to subdue <lb/>
            Asia in war. With these feelings, therefore, he led his forces <lb/>
            over the Hellespont, and employed such expedition, that he <lb/>
            accomplished in thirty days a journey which Xerxes had taken <lb/>
            a year to perform.! When he was not very far from the <lb/>
            Peloponnesus, the Athenians and Bœotians, and ethers in <note type="footnote"> * In comitio.] A Latin word used by the author for the Greek, which <lb/>

             <pb n="391"/>
            alliance with them, endeavoured to make a stand against him <lb/>
            at Coronea, all of whom he defeated in a great battle. It was <lb/>
            an eminent merit in his victory, that when a numerous body <lb/>
            of the enemy had taken refuge in a temple of Minerva after <lb/>
            the defeat, and the question was put to him, " what he would <lb/>
            wish to be done with them," he, though he had received some <lb/>
            wounds in the battle, and seemed angry with all who had <lb/>
            borne arms against him, preferred, nevertheless, respect for <lb/>
            religion to the gratification of his resentment, and gave orders <lb/>
            that they should suffer no injury. Nor did he act thus in <lb/>
            Greece only,-so as to save the temples of the gods from <lb/>
            profanation,-but even among the barbarians also, he preserved <lb/>
            every image and altar with the utmost scrupulosity. He used <lb/>
            publicly to observe, therefore, that " he wondered those were <lb/>
            not counted in the number of the sacrilegious who injured <lb/>
            the suppliants of the gods,. or that those who lessened respect <lb/>
            for religion were not visited with severer punishments than <lb/>
            those who robbed temples."</p>
          <p>V. After this battle all the war was concentrated about <lb/>
            Corinth, and was accordingly called the Corinthian war. <lb/>
            During this contest, when, in one battle, in which Agesilaus <lb/>
            was general,! there had fallen ten thousand of the enemy, <lb/>
            and the strength of his opponents seemed broken by that <lb/>
            catastrophe, he was so far from presumptuous boasting,‡ <lb/>
            that he expressed commiseration for the fortune of Greece, <lb/>
            since it was through the fault of his enemies that so many <lb/>
            had been defeated and killed by him, for with that number, <lb/>
            if the mind of his adversaries had been but right, the Persians <lb/>
            might have been forced to make atonement to Greece. <lb/>
            When he had driven the enemy, too, within their walls, and <note type="footnote"> * Supplicibus eorum.] Whether eorum, refers to barbaros which is <lb/>
            nearer to it, or to deorum, which is farther from it, has been a question <lb/>
            among the commentators. Bos refers it to deorum, and I think him <lb/>
            right. A recent editor imagines that it is to be referred to simulacra <lb/>
            Masque. Magius would read deorum instead of eorum, and his sugges <lb/>
            tion is approved by Bremi and Buchling. </note><note type="footnote"> + This appears to be an error; for Xenophon, Ages. 7, 5, and <lb/>
            Plutarch, Vit. Ages. speak of Agesilaus as having heard about the <lb/>
            battle; and it is therefore to be concluded, as Magius and Lambinus <lb/>
            observe, that he was not present in it, but that it took place while ho <lb/>
            was on his march homeward. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Ab insolentia gloriæ.] " From the presumptuousness of boasting." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="392"/>
            many exhorted him to attack Corinth, he said, " that it would <lb/>
            not be consistent with his character in war to do so; since he <lb/>
            was one," he said, " who would oblige offenders to return to <lb/>
            their duty, not one who would destroy the noblest cities of <lb/>
            Greece; for if we should proceed," he added, " to extirpate <lb/>
            those who have supported us against the barbarians, we should <lb/>
            weaken ourselves while the barbarians remain at their ease ; <lb/>
            and, when this has taken place, they will easily bring us <lb/>
            under their power whenever they please."</p>
          <p>VI. In the mean time the disaster at Leuctra befel the <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians; and that he might not march thither,* <lb/>
            though he was urged by many to go to the field, he refused <lb/>
            to go, as if he had a presentiment concerning the event. But <lb/>
            when Epaminondas attacked Sparta, and the city was without <lb/>
            walls, he proved himself such a commander, that it was <lb/>
            apparent to all on that occasion, that if it had not been for <lb/>
            him, Sparta would have ceased to exist.t In this time 01 <lb/>
            danger, indeed, the celerity of his proceedings was the pre­ <lb/>
            servation of the whole people; for when a number of the young <lb/>
            men, alarmed at the approach of the enemy, had determined <lb/>
            on going over to the Thebans, and had taken a position on an <lb/>
            eminence without the city, Agesilaus, who saw that it would <lb/>
            have a most pernicious effect, if it were noticed that any <lb/>
            were trying to desert to the enemy, went thither with some <lb/>
            of his men, and, as if they had been acting with a good <lb/>
            intention, commended their procedure in having taken posses­ <lb/>
            sion of that spot, and said that he himself had also observed <lb/>
            that this ought to be done. Thus, by his pretended com­ <lb/>
            mendation, he prevented the young men from deserting, and, <lb/>
            after joining some of his followers with them, left the place <lb/>
            quite safe ; for when the number of those was increased who <lb/>
            were unacquainted with the project, ‡ the conspirators were <note type="footnote"> * Qu<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὸ</foreign> ne proficisceretur—exire noluit. The conclusion of the sentence <lb/>

            afraid to mo ve, and retained their ground the more willingly <lb/>
            as they thought that what they had meditated was still <lb/>
            unknown.</p>
          <p>VII. After the battle of Leuctra, it is certain, the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians never recovered themselves, or regained their former <lb/>
            power, though, at that period, Agesilaus did not cease to assist <lb/>
            his country by whatever means he could use. When the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians were greatly in want of money, he gave his <lb/>
            support to all those * who had revolted from the king, and <lb/>
            being presented by them with a large sum, he relieved his <lb/>
            country with it. In his character, indeed, this point was par­ <lb/>
            ticularly worthy of admiration, that, though great presents <lb/>
            were given him by kings, princes, and states, he never took any <lb/>
            portion of them into his own house, and never departed in the <lb/>
            least from the usual diet and dress of the Spartans; he <lb/>
            remained content with the same house which Eurysthenes, the <lb/>
            progenitor of his family, had inhabited; and whoever entered <lb/>
            it could see no indication of luxury or extravagance, but, on <lb/>
            the contrary, many proofs of temperance and frugality, for it <lb/>
            was furnished in such a manner that it differed in no respect <lb/>
            from that of any poor or private person.</p>
          <p>VIII. As this great man had found nature favourable in <lb/>
            giving him excellent qualities of mind, so he found her unpro­ <lb/>
            pitious with regard to the formation of his body; for he was <lb/>
            of low stature, small in person, and lame of one foot. <lb/>
            These circumstances rendered his appearance the reverse of <lb/>
            attractive, and strangers, when they looked at his person, felt <lb/>
            only contempt for him, while those who knew his merits could <lb/>
            not sufficiently admire him. Such fortune attended him, <lb/>
            when, at the age of eighty, he went into Egypt to the aid <lb/>
            of Tachos, and lay down with his men on the shore without <lb/>
            any shelter, having merely such a couch that the ground was <lb/>
            but covered with straw, and nothing more than a skin thrown <lb/>
            upon it,t while all his attendants lay in the same manner, in <lb/>
            plain and well-worn attire, so that their equipments not only <note type="footnote">strengthened by the followers of Agesilaus. Bos, however, suggests at <lb/>
            the same time, that we might read aucti numero eorum, which Bremi is <lb/>

            did not indicate that there was a king among them, but even <lb/>
            raised a suspicion that he must be a man not very rich. The <lb/>
            news of his arrival having reached the king's officers, presents <lb/>
            of every kind were soon brought him; but when the officers <lb/>
            inquired for Agesilaus, they could scarcely be made to believe <lb/>
            that he was one of those who were sitting before them. When <lb/>
            they presented him what they had brought, with a message <lb/>
            from the king, he accepted nothing but some veal, and such <lb/>
            sorts of meat as his present circumstances required; the oint­ <lb/>
            ments, chaplets, and sweetmeats he distributed among the <lb/>
            slaves, and the other things he directed to be carried back. <lb/>
            Upon this, the barbarians looked upon him still more con­ <lb/>
            temptuously, thinking that he had made choice of what he had <lb/>
            taken from ignorance of what was valuable.</p>
          <p>As he was returning from Egypt, after having been pre­ <lb/>
            sented by King Nectanabis * with two hundred and twenty <lb/>
            talents, in order that he might bestow them upon his country­ <lb/>
            men, and had arrived at what is called the harbour of Mene­ <lb/>
            laus,t lying between Cyrenae‡ and Egypt, he fell in and died. <lb/>
            His friends, in order the more conveniently to convey him to <lb/>
            Sparta, enveloped his body, as they had no honey, in wax, and <lb/>
            so carried it home. <note type="footnote"> * Nectanabis II., nephew of Tachos, whom he dethroned with the <lb/>

          <p>I. EUMENES was a native of Cardia.* If success equal to <lb/>
            his abilities had been granted him, he would not, indeed, have <lb/>
            been a greater man (for we estimate great men by merit, not <lb/>
            by fortune), but he would have been much more renowned, <lb/>
            and more honoured. As he happened to live, however, in the <lb/>
            days in which the Macedonians flourished, it was a great disad­ <lb/>
            vantage to him residing among them, that he was of a foreign <lb/>
            country. Nor was anything wanting to him but a noble <lb/>
            descent; for, though he was of a family of distinction in his <lb/>
            native city, the Macedonians were nevertheless dissatisfied that <lb/>
            he should ever be preferred to them. They were obliged to <lb/>
            submit, however, for he excelled them all in caution, vigilance, <lb/>
            endurance, and acuteness and activity of intellect.</p>
          <p>When he was but a youth, he was received into favour by <lb/>
            Philip, the son of Amyntas, and after a short time was admitted <lb/>
            into intimate friendship with him; for, even then, when he was <lb/>
            so young, there appeared to be great natural talent in him. He <lb/>
            therefore kept him near himself in the office of secretary, which <lb/>
            is much more honourable t among the Greeks than among the <note type="footnote"> * Cardianus.] Cardia was a town in the Thracian Chersonese, on <lb/>
            the gulf of Melas. </note><note type="footnote"> + Multo honorificentius.] Because freedmen and slaves, for the most <lb/>
            part, purchased the office of scribe or secretary among the Romans <lb/>
            with money, as is observed by Casaubon in Capitolin. Vit. Macrini, <lb/>
            c. 7, and by Lipsius, Elect. i. 32.—Loccenius. At Athens, however, <lb/>
            Samuel Petit, Comm. in Leges Atticas, 1. ii. tit. 2, shows that the <lb/>
            office of scribe was as little honourable as it was at Rome.—Bos. <lb/>
            Such was doubtless the case throughout Greece a few of the more </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="396"/>
            Romans; for with us, secretaries are regarded as hirelings, as <lb/>
            in reality they are; but with them, on the contrary, no one is <lb/>
            admitted to that office who is not of good family and of known <lb/>
            integrity and ability, because he must of necessity be the con­ <lb/>
            ndant of all their political measures. This post of confidence <lb/>
            he held for seven years under Philip, and after Philip was <lb/>
            assassinated, he was in the same office for thirteen years <lb/>
            under Alexander. During the latter portion of this time, also, <lb/>
            he commanded one of the two divisions of the cavalry called <lb/>
            Hetærice.* With both these princes he always had a place <lb/>
            in the council, and was admitted to a knowledge of all their <lb/>
            proceedings.</p>
          <p>11. After the death of Alexander at Babylon, when king­ <lb/>
            doms were allotted to each of his friends, and the superin­ <lb/>
            tendence of affairs was committed to the hands† of Perdiccas, <lb/>
            to whom Alexander, when dying, had given his ring (a circum­ <lb/>
            stance from which every one conjectured that Alexander had <lb/>
            entrusted his kingdom to him, until his children should come <lb/>
            of age to take the government upon themselves; ‡ for Craterus <lb/>
            and Antipater, who seemed to have the precedence of him, were <lb/>
            absent, and Hephæstion, for whom Alexander, as might easily <lb/>
            be perceived, had had the highest esteem, was dead), at that <lb/>
            time Cappadocia was given to Eumenes, or rather appointed <lb/>
            for him, for it was then in the power of the enemy. Perdiccas <lb/>
            had sought with great eagerness to attach Eumenes to him, <lb/>
            for he saw in him great honour and ability,§ and did not doubt <lb/>
            that, if he could gain him over to his side, he would be of <lb/>
            great assistance to him in the projects which he was meditating, <lb/>
            since he purposed (what all in great power generally covet) to <lb/>
            seize and secure for himself the shares of all the rest. Nor <lb/>
            did he alone, indeed, entertain such designs, but all the others, <note type="footnote">eminent secretaries might be held in esteem and respect, but the <lb/>
            majority would be of just the same standing as at Rome. </note><note type="footnote"> * '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Εταιρικὴ ἵππος</foreign>, about a thousand or twelve hundred of the <lb/>

            who had been friends of Alexander, formed similar intentions. <lb/>
            Leonnatus,* in the first place, had resolved to seize upon <lb/>
            Macedonia, and had endeavoured, by liberal promises, to pre­ <lb/>
            vail upon Eumenes to desert Perdiccas, and form an alliance <lb/>
            with himself. Being unable to make any impression upon <lb/>
            him, he attempted to take his life, and would have effected his <lb/>
            purpose, had he not secretly escaped from his guards by night.</p>
          <p>III. In the meantime those wars broke out, which, after <lb/>
            the death of Alexander, were carried on to desperation ;f and <lb/>
            all combined to ruin Perdiccas. Eumenes, though he saw <lb/>
            that he was but weak, as he was obliged to stand alone against <lb/>
            them all, yet did not forsake a friend, or show himself more <lb/>
            desirous of safety than of honour. Perdiccas had set him over <lb/>
            that part of Asia which lies between Mount Taurus and the <lb/>
            Hellespont, and had opposed him alone to his European <lb/>
            adversaries.‡ Perdiccas himself had marched against Ptolemy, <lb/>
            to make an attack upon Egypt. Eumenes, as he had an army <lb/>
            neither numerous nor strong, for it wanted exercise, and had <lb/>
            not long been assembled, while Antipater and Craterus were <lb/>
            said to be fast approaching, and to have passed the Hellespont, <lb/>
            men who stood high in reputation and experience in war (and <lb/>
            the Macedonian soldiers were then held in the same esteem <lb/>
            in which the Romans are now held, for those have always been <lb/>
            accounted the bra7est who have attained the greatest power), <lb/>
            Eumenes, I say, was aware, that if his troops should learn <lb/>
            against whom they were being led, they would not only not <lb/>
            proceed, but would disperse at the intelligence; and it was <lb/>
            therefore a very clever stratagem of his, to lead his men <lb/>
            through bye-roads, in which they could not hear the truth, <lb/>
            and to make them believe that he was marching against <lb/>
            some of the barbarians. In this artifice he successfully <lb/>
            persevered, and drew out his army into the field, and joined <lb/>
            battle, before the men were aware with whom they were <lb/>
            engaged. He succeeded, also, by an advantageous choice of <lb/>
            ground, in fighting more with his cavalry, in which he had <note type="footnote"> * A distinguished officer in the army of Alexander, after whose <lb/>
            death he had the government of Phrygia on the Hellespont. </note><note type="footnote"> † Ad internecionem.] Properly, " to the utter destruction" of one of <lb/>

            the superiority, than with his infantry, in which he was but <lb/>
            weak.</p>
          <p>IV. After they had continued the contest, with desperate <lb/>
            efforts, through the greater part of the day, Craterus, the com­ <lb/>
            mander-in-chief, was killed, as well as Neoptolemus who held <lb/>
            the second place in authority. With Eumenes Neoptolemus <lb/>
            himself encountered, and as they grappled with one another, <lb/>
            and fell from their horses to the ground (so that it might easily <lb/>
            be seen that they fought with feelings of enmity, and warred <lb/>
            more with their minds than with their bodies), they could not <lb/>
            be separated till life left one of the two. Eumenes received <lb/>
            some wounds from Neoptolemus, yet did not, on that account, <lb/>
            retire from the field, but pressed more vigorously upon the <lb/>
            enemy. The horse being routed, Craterus the general slain, and <lb/>
            many, chiefly of high rank, being made prisoners, the infantry, as <lb/>
            they were forced into a position from which they could not escape <lb/>
            without the permission of Eumenes, begged peace of him. But <lb/>
            when they had obtained it, they did not adhere to their word, <lb/>
            but went off, as soon as they could, to Antipater. Eumenes <lb/>
            endeavoured to save the life of Craterus, who was carried half <lb/>
            dead from the field; but, not being able to succeed, he interred <lb/>
            him, suitably to his dignity and their former friendship (for he <lb/>
            had been intimate with him in Alexander's life-time), with a <lb/>
            magnificent funeral, and sent his bones into Macedonia to his <lb/>
            wife and children.</p>
          <p>V. During the course of these proceedings on the Helles­ <lb/>
            pont, Perdiccas was killed by Seleucus and Antigonus* on the <lb/>
            river Nile, and the chief command was conferred upon Anti­ <lb/>
            pater. Upon this, those who had deserted him were con­ <lb/>
            demned to death in their absence, the army giving their <lb/>
            suffrage to that effect; and among those condemned was <lb/>
            Eumenes, who, though he was affected at this blow,† did not <lb/>
            sink under it, or conduct the war with the less vigour. <note type="footnote"> * A Sdeuco et Antigono.] For Antigono it is now generally supposed <lb/>
            that we should read Antigene, Antigenes being mentioned by Diod. Sic. <lb/>
            xviii. 59, as one of the leaders of the Argyraspides; another being <lb/>
            Teutamus. Antigenes was the first to attack Perdiccas, as Van <lb/>
            Staveren observes, referring to Arrian apud Photium, p. 224. The <lb/>
            same critic suggests that we might even, with some probability alter <lb/>

             </p>
          <p>But a course of necessitous circumstances, though they <lb/>
            could not subdue the energy of his spirit, had yet some <lb/>
            effect in diminishing it. Antigonus, however, who pursued <lb/>
            him, was often, though he had plenty of all kinds of troops, <lb/>
            severely harassed by him on the march, nor could he ever <lb/>
            come to an engagement with him except in places in which <lb/>
            a few could resist many. But at last, when he could not be <lb/>
            taken by manoeuvring, he was hemmed in by numbers; still <lb/>
            he extricated himself, though with the loss of several men, <lb/>
            and took refuge in a fortress of Phrygia, called Nora; where, <lb/>
            being besieged, and fearing that, by remaining in one place, <lb/>
            he should lose his war-horses, as there was no room for exer­ <lb/>
            cising them, he adopted an ingenious expedient,. by which <lb/>
            the animal might be warmed and exercised standing, so that <lb/>
            it might take its food more freely, and not be deprived of the <lb/>
            benefit of bodily motion. He tied up its head † so high with <lb/>
            a halter, that it could not quite touch the ground with its <lb/>
            fore- feet; he then forced it, by lashing it behind, to leap up <lb/>
            and throw back its heels; which motions excited perspiration <lb/>
            no less than if the animal had run in an open course. Hence <lb/>
            it happened (what was a matter of astonishment to all), that <lb/>
            he led out his horses from the fortress, though he had been <lb/>
            several months under siege, equally as sleek as if he had been <lb/>
            keeping them in open fields. During that siege, as often as <lb/>
            he desired, he either set on fire or demolished the works and <lb/>
            defences of Antigonus. He, however, kept himself in that one <lb/>
            place as long as the winter lasted; but, as the fortress could <lb/>
            have no relief from without, and the spring was coming on, he <lb/>
            pretended to be desirous of surrendering, and, while he was <lb/>
            treating about the terms, eluded the officers of Antigonus, and <lb/>
            brought himself and all his men off safe.</p>
          <p>VI. When Olympias, who was the mother of Alexander, <lb/>
            sent letters and messengers into Asia to Eumenes, to consult <lb/>
            him whether she should proceed to re-possess herself of <lb/>
            Macedonia (for she was then living in Epirus), and take upon <lb/>
            Herself the government there, he advised her, "above all <note type="footnote"> * Callidum fuit ejus inventum, quemadmodum, &amp;c.] " It was an <lb/>

            things, not to stir, but to wait till Alexander's son should get <lb/>
            the throne; yet, if she should be hurried into Macedonia by <lb/>
            any irresistible longing, he recommended her to forget all <lb/>
            injuries, and not to exercise too severe an authority over any <lb/>
            one." But with neither of these suggestions did she comply; <lb/>
            for she both went to Macedonia, and acted there with the <lb/>
            greatest cruelty. She then entreated Eumenes, while he was <lb/>
            still at a distance, “ not to allow the bitterest enemies of <lb/>
            Philip's house and family to extirpate his very race, but to <lb/>
            give his support to the children of Alexander;" adding that, <lb/>
            " if he would do her such a favour, he might raise troops as soon <lb/>
            as possible, and bring them to her aid; and, in order that he <lb/>
            might do so more easily, she had written to all the governors <lb/>
            of the provinces that preserved their allegiance, to obey him, <lb/>
            and follow his counsels." Eumenes, moved with this corn <lb/>
            munication, thought it better, if fortune should so order it, <lb/>
            to perish in showing his gratitude to those who had deserved <lb/>
            well of him, than to live ungrateful.</p>
          <p>VII. He therefore assembled troops, and prepared for war <lb/>
            against Antigonus. But as there were with him several noble <lb/>
            Macedonians, amongst whom were Peucestes, who had been <lb/>
            one of Alexander's body-guard, and was then governor of <lb/>
            Persia, and Antigenes, under whose command the Macedonian <lb/>
            phalanx was, dreading envy (which, nevertheless, he could not <lb/>
            escapee if he, being a foreigner, should have the chief <lb/>
            authority rather than others of the Macedonians, of whom there <lb/>
            was a great number there, he erected a pavilion at head <lb/>
            quarters,. in the name of Alexander, and caused a gold chair, <lb/>
            with a sceptre and diadem, to be placed in it, directing that all <lb/>
            should meet at it daily, that counsel might be taken there <lb/>
            concerning matters of importance; for he thought that he <lb/>
            should incur less envy if he appeared to manage the war under <lb/>
            show of the authority, and with assumption of the name, of <lb/>
            Alexander; and in this point he succeeded; for, as the <lb/>
            meetings were held, not at the tent of Eumenes, but at that <lb/>
            of the king, and measures concerted there, his superiority was <note type="footnote"> * In principiis.] See note on Florus, ii. 10, Bohn's Cl. Library. <lb/>
            Eumenes, to give effect to this device, pretended, as Polyænus tells us, <lb/>
            to have received directions from the spirit of Alexander, which had <lb/>
            appeared to him in a dream. It is strange that the Macedonian off­ <lb/>
            cera should have allowed themselves to be so deluded. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="401"/>
            in some degree concealed, though all was done by his agency <lb/>
            alone.</p>
          <p>VIII. He engaged with Antigonus in the country of the <lb/>
            Parætaci, not with his army in full array, but on the march, <lb/>
            and forced him, after being severely handled, to return into <lb/>
            Media to winter. He himself distributed his troops in winter- <lb/>
            quarters through the neighbouring country of Persia, not as <lb/>
            he chose, but as the will of his soldiers obliged him; for the <lb/>
            phalanx of Alexander the Great, which had over-run Asia, and <lb/>
            subdued the Persians, desired, in consequence of their <lb/>
            established renown, and also through long-continued license, <lb/>
            not to obey their officers but to command them, as our veterans <lb/>
            now do. There is danger, therefore, lest ours should do what <lb/>
            those did, and, by their insubordination and excessive <lb/>
            licentiousness, ruin all, not less those whom they have <lb/>
            supported than those whom they have opposed. And if any <lb/>
            one reads the acts of those veterans, he will find the <lb/>
            proceedings of ours like theirs, and be. of opinion that there is <lb/>
            no other difference between them but that of time. But I <lb/>
            return to those of Macedonia. They had fixed upon their <lb/>
            winter-quarters, not from regard to convenience for warfare, <lb/>
            but for luxurious indulgence; and had separated into parties <lb/>
            at a great distance from one another. Antigonus, hearing of <lb/>
            their dispersion, and being aware that he was not a match for <lb/>
            his enemies when prepared to receive him, resolved that some <lb/>
            new plan must be adopted. There were two ways by which be <lb/>
            might march from the country of the Medes, where he was <lb/>
            wintering, to the winter-quarters of his adversaries, of which <lb/>
            the shorter lay through desert tracts, which nobody inhabited <lb/>
            by reason of the scarcity of water, but was only about ten days' <lb/>
            march. The other, by which everybody travelled, presented a <lb/>
            circuitous route of twice the length, but was well-supplied, and <lb/>
            abounded with all necessaries. If he went by the latter, he felt <lb/>
            sure that the enemy would know of his approach before he had <lb/>
            accomplished the third part of the distance; but if he hurried <lb/>
            through the deserts, he hoped that he might surprise his <lb/>
            adversaries unawares. To effect his object, he ordered as <lb/>
            many skins and sacks as possible to be got in readiness; and <lb/>
            then forage and dressed provisions for ten days; desiring that <lb/>
            as little fire as possible should be made in the camp. The <lb/>
            route which he had in view be concealed from every one. <note type="footnote"> D D </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="402"/>
            Being thus provided, be set forward in the direction on which <lb/>
            he had determined.</p>
          <p>IX. He had accomplished about half the distance, when, <lb/>
            from the smoke of his camp, a suspicion was hinted to <lb/>
            Eumenes that an enemy was approaching. His officers held <lb/>
            a meeting; and it was considered what ought to be done. <lb/>
            They were all aware that their troops could not be assembled <lb/>
            so soon as Antigonus seemed likely to be upon them; and <lb/>
            while they were all consequently in perplexity, and despair <lb/>
            ing of their safety,. Eumenes said that “ If they would but use <lb/>
            activity, and execute his orders (which they had not done <lb/>
            before), he would put an end to their difficulties ; for, though <lb/>
            the enemy might now finish his journey in five days, he would <lb/>
            take care that they should be delayed not less than as many <lb/>
            days more.† They must therefore go about, and each collect <lb/>
            his troops."</p>
          <p>To retard the progress of Antigonus he adopted the follow­ <lb/>
            ing stratagem. He sent trustworthy men to the foot of the <lb/>
            mountains, which lay over against the enemy's route, and <lb/>
            ordered them, as soon as night came on, to make as large fires <lb/>
            and as far dispersed, as they could; to reduce them at the <lb/>
            second watch, and to make them very small at the third; and, by <lb/>
            imitating the usages of a camp, to raise a suspicion in the <lb/>
            enemy that there was actually a camp in tnose parts, and that <lb/>
            intelligence had been given of their approach; and he told <lb/>
            them to act in the same way on the following night. The <lb/>
            men to whom this commission was given carefully observed their <lb/>
            instructions. Antigonus, when darkness came on, saw the <lb/>
            fires, and supposed that something had been heard of his <lb/>
            coming, and that his enemies had assembled their force on <lb/>
            that quarter. He therefore changed his intention, and, <lb/>
            thinking that he could not surprise them unawares, altered <lb/>
            his route, and took the longer circuit of the well-supplied road, <lb/>
            on which he halted for one day, to refresh his weary men and <lb/>
            recruit his horses, that he might come tc battle with his <lb/>
            army in better condition.</p>
          <p>X. On this occasion Eumenes overreached a crafty general <lb/>
            by stratagem, and obviated the suddenness of his attack; yet <note type="footnote"> * De rebus summis.] " Of their chief concerns." </note><note type="footnote"> t Non minus totidem dierum spatio.] “ Not less than the space of <lb/>
            just as many days. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="403"/>
            he gained but little by his success ; for through the envy <lb/>
            of the officers with whom he had to act, and the treachery of <lb/>
            the Macedonian veterans, he was delivered up, after he had <lb/>
            come off superior in the field, to Antigonus, though they had <lb/>
            previously sworn, at three several times, that they would <lb/>
            defend him and never forsake him. But such was the eager­ <lb/>
            ness of some to detract from his merit, that they chose rather <lb/>
            to break their faith than not betray him. Antigonus, however, <lb/>
            though he had been a violent enemy to him, would have <lb/>
            spared his life, if he had but been allowed to do so by his <lb/>
            friends, because he was certain that he could not be better <lb/>
            assisted by any one in those difficulties which, as was apparent <lb/>
            to all, were likely to fall upon him. For Lysimachus, Seleucus, <lb/>
            and Ptolemy, now powerful in resources, were assuming a <lb/>
            threatening attitude, and he would be obliged to contend with <lb/>
            them for supremacy. But those who were about him would <lb/>
            not allow of such clemency; for they saw that if Eumenes <lb/>
            were admitted to his councils, they themselves would be of <lb/>
            small account in comparison with him. As for Antigonus <lb/>
            himself, he had been so incensed against him, that he could <lb/>
            never have been induced to relent, except by a strong expecta­ <lb/>
            tion of eminent services from him.</p>
          <p>XI. When he had committed him to custody, therefore, <lb/>
            and the commander of the guard inquired how he would have <lb/>
            him kept, he replied, " As the most furious lion, or the most <lb/>
            savage elephant;" for he had not then determined whether <lb/>
            he should spare his life or not. Meanwhile two classes of <lb/>
            people crowded to gaze upon Eumenes, those who, from <lb/>
            hatred of him, wished to feast their eyes. on his degradation <lb/>
            and those who, from old friendship, desired to speak with him <lb/>
            and console him. Many also came with them who werb <lb/>
            anxious to look at his person, and to see what sort of man he <lb/>
            was whom they had feared so long and so much, and in whose <lb/>
            destruction they had placed their hopes of victory. But Eu­ <lb/>
            menes, when he had been some time under confinement, said to <lb/>
            Onomarchus, in whose hands the chief command of the guard <lb/>
            was, that " he wondered why he was thus kept a third day; <lb/>
            for that it was not consistent with prudence on the part of <lb/>
            Antigonus to treat t one whom he had conquered in such a <note type="footnote"> * Fructum ocutis capere.] " To gain gratification for their eyes." </note><note type="footnote"> t Ut deuteretur.] The word deutor is not found elsewhere. It seems </note> <note type="footnote"> DD a</note> <lb/>
             <pb n="404"/>
            manner, but that he should order him either to be put to death <lb/>
            or released." As he seemed to Onomarohus to express himself <lb/>
            somewhat arrogantly, he replied, “ Why, if you were of such a <lb/>
            spirit, did you not rather die on the field of battle, than fall <lb/>
            into the hands of your enemy?" “ Would indeed that that <lb/>
            had befallen me," rejoined Eumenes, " but it did not happen <lb/>
            because I never engaged with a stouter than myself; for I <lb/>
            have never crossed swords with any one who did not yield to <lb/>
            me; and I have not fallen by the prowess of my enemies, but <lb/>
            by the perfidy of my friends.” Nor was this assertion false; <lb/>
            for he was a man not only of a graceful * and dignified bearing, <lb/>
            but of strength sufficient for enduring fatigue; yet he was not <lb/>
            so much distinguished for tallnes of person as for handsome­ <lb/>
            ness of shape.</p>
          <p>XII. As Antigonus would not venture alone to determine <lb/>
            concerning him, he referred the decision to a council; where, <lb/>
            when almost all the officers, in great excitement, expressed <lb/>
            their surprise that death had not been already inflicted on a <lb/>
            man by whom they had been harassed so many years, so <lb/>
            severely that they were often reduced to despair, a man who had <lb/>
            cut off leaders of the greatest eminence; and in whom, though <lb/>
            but a single individual, there was so much to be dreaded, that <lb/>
            as long as he lived they could not think themselves safe, while, <lb/>
            if he were put to death, they would have no further anxiety ; <lb/>
            and in conclusion they asked Antigonus, " if be gave Eumenes <lb/>
            his life, what friends he would employ ? for that they would not <lb/>
            act under him with Eumenes." After thus learning the <lb/>
            sentiments of the council, he nevertheless took time for con­ <lb/>
            sideration till the seventh day following; when, being afraid <lb/>
            that a mutiny might break out in the army, he gave orders <lb/>
            that no one should be admitted to Eumenes, and that his daily <lb/>
            food should be withheld ; for be said that “ he would offer no <lb/>
            personal violence to a man who had once been his friend.” <lb/>
            Eumenes, however, after suffering from hunger not more than <lb/>
            three days, was killed by his guards on the removal of the <lb/>
            camp, without Antigonus’s knowledge. <note type="footnote"> not to be the same with abutor, as some suppose, but to have much the <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>XIII. Thus Eumenes, at the age of five-and-forty years, <lb/>
            after having attended on Philip, as we have shown above, for <lb/>
            seven years from the age of twenty, and having held the same <lb/>
            office under Alexander for thirteen years, during one of which <lb/>
            he had commanded a troop of cavalry; and after having, <lb/>
            subsequently to Alexander's death, conducted armies as <lb/>
            commander in-chief, and having sometimes repelled and some­ <lb/>
            times cut off the most eminent generals, being made prisoner, <lb/>
            not by the ability of Antigonus, but by the perjury of the <lb/>
            Macedonians, ended his life in this manner.- How great <lb/>
            awe was entertained of him by all those who were styled <lb/>
            kings after the death of Alexander the Great, may be easily <lb/>
            judged from the following fact, that no one of them, while <lb/>
            Eumenes lived, was called a king, but only a governor ; but <lb/>
            that, after his death, they at once assumed the regal dress <lb/>
            and title; nor did they care to perform what they had <lb/>
            originally promised, namely, to guard the throne for Alexan­ <lb/>
            der's children; but, as soon as the only defender of the <lb/>
            children was removed, they disclosed what their real views <lb/>
            were. In this iniquity the leaders were Antigonus, Ptolemy, <lb/>
            Seleucus, Lysimachus, and Cassander.</p>
          <p>Antigonus gave the dead body of Eumenes to bis relations <lb/>
            for burial; and they interred him with a military and mag­ <lb/>
            nificent funeral, and took care that his bones should be <lb/>
            conveyed to Cappadocia to his mother, wife, and children.</p>

            but of the other the fame is great; and hence he was sur­ <lb/>
            named The Good. He was always poor, though he might <lb/>
            have been extremely rich, by reason of the numerous offices <lb/>
            conferred upon him. and the high commissions given him by <lb/>
            the people. When he refused the present of a large sum of <lb/>
            money from King Philip, and Philip's ambassadors urged him <lb/>
            to receive it, and at the same time reminded him, that if he <lb/>
            himself could easily do without it, he should nevertheless have <lb/>
            some regard for his children, for whom it would be difficult, <lb/>
            in the depth of poverty, to act up to the high character of their <lb/>
            father, he gave them this answer: "If my children be like <lb/>
            me, this same little farm, which has enabled me to reach my <lb/>
            present eminence, will maintain them; but if they prove <lb/>
            unlike me, I should not wish their luxury to be supported <lb/>
            and increased at my expense."</p>
          <p>II. After fortune had continued favourable to him almost <lb/>
            to his eightieth year, he fell, towards the close of his life, into <lb/>
            great unpopularity with his countrymen. In the first place, <lb/>
            he had acted in concert with Demades in delivering up the <lb/>
            city to Antipater; and, by his suggestions, Demostbenes and <lb/>
            others, who were thought to deserve well of their country, <lb/>
            had been sent into banishment by a decree of the people. <lb/>
            Nor had he given offence only in this respect, that he had <lb/>
            ill consulted the interest of his country, but also in not <lb/>
            having observed the obligations of friendship; for though he <lb/>
            had risen to the eminence which he then held through being <lb/>
            supported and aided by Demosthenes, when he furnished him <lb/>
            with means of defence against Chares,* and though he had <lb/>
            several times come off with acquittal on trials, when he had to <lb/>
            plead for his life, through having been defended by Demos­ <lb/>
            thenes, he not only did not take the part of Demosthenes <lb/>
            when he was in peril, but even betrayed him. But his fate <lb/>
            was decided chiefly on one charge, that, when the supreme <lb/>
            government of the state was in his hands, and he was warned <lb/>
            by Dercyllus that Nicanor, the prefect of Cassander, was <note type="footnote"> * Quum adversus Charetem eum subornaret.] I have given to suborna­ <unclear/> <lb/>
            ret the sense to which Bos thinks it entitled. To what part of <lb/>
            Phocion's life this passage relates is uncertain. Bos refers to Plutarch, <lb/>
            Phocion, c. 14, where it is stated that Phocion was sent to Byzantium <lb/>
            with a force to accomplish what Chares had failed in doing. But no <lb/>
            mention is made there of any support given to Phocion by Demos­ <lb/>

             <pb n="407"/>
            forming designs upon the Piraeus, and Dercyllus begged him, <lb/>
            at the same time, to take care that the city should not want <lb/>
            provisions, Phocion told him in the hearing of the people, <lb/>
            that there was no danger, and engaged to be security for the <lb/>
            truth of his statement; whereas Nicanor, not long after, <lb/>
            became master of the Piræeus; and when the people assembled <lb/>
            under arms to defend that harbour, without which Athens <lb/>
            could not at all subsist, Phocion not only did not call any body <lb/>
            to arms, but would not even take the command of those who <lb/>
            were armed.</p>
          <p>III. There were at that period in Athens two parties, one <lb/>
            of which espoused the cause of the people, and the other that <lb/>
            of the aristocracy; to the latter Phocion and Demetrius <lb/>
            Phalereus were attached. Each of them relied on the sup­ <lb/>
            port of the Macedonians; for the popular party favoured <lb/>
            Polysperchon, and the aristocracy took the side of Cassander. <lb/>
            After a time Cassander was driven from Macedonia by Poly­ <lb/>
            sperchon ; and the people, in consequence, getting the <lb/>
            superiority, immediately expelled from their country the <lb/>
            leaders of the opposite faction, after they had been capitally <lb/>
            convicted;. and among them Phocion and Demetrius Pha <lb/>
            lereus; and they then sent a deputation on the subject to <lb/>
            Polysperchon, to request him to confirm their decrees. Pho­ <lb/>
            cion went to him at the same time, and as soon as he arrived <lb/>
            he was summoned to plead his cause, nominally before King <lb/>
            Philip,t but in reality before Polysperchon; for he at that <lb/>
            time held the direction of the king's affairs. Being accused <lb/>
            by Agnonides‡ of having betrayed the Piræeus to Nicanor, and <lb/>
            being thrown, by order of the council, into confinement, he <lb/>
            was then conveyed to Athens, that a trial might there be held <lb/>
            upon him according to law.</p>
          <p>IV. On his arrival, as he was weak in his feet through age, <lb/>
            and was brought to the city in a carriage, great crowds of <lb/>
            people gathered about him, of whom some, calling to mind <lb/>
            his former reputation, expressed commiseration for his declining <note type="footnote"> * Capitis damnatos.] That is, made atimous, or infamous, deprived <lb/>
            of civil rights, and condemned, perhaps, in addition, to exile or death. </note><note type="footnote"> † Philip Aridæus, the half brother and nominal successor of Alex­ <lb/>

            years but the greater number were violently exasperated <lb/>
            against him, from the suspicion that he had betrayed the <lb/>
            Piræeus, but especially because he had opposed the interest of <lb/>
            the people in his old age. Hence not even the liberty of make <lb/>
            ing a speech, and of pleading his cause, was granted him, but <lb/>
            being forthwith sentenced to death, after some formalities of <lb/>
            law had been despatched, he was delivered over to the eleven,­ <lb/>
            to whom public criminals, by the custom of the Athenians, <lb/>
            are wont to be consigned. As he was being led to execution, <lb/>
            Emphyletus, a man with whom he had been very intimate, <lb/>
            met him, and having exclaimed, with tears, "0 what unworthy <lb/>
            treatment you suffer, Phocion! " Phocion rejoined, " But not <lb/>
            unexpected, for most of the famous men of Athens have come <lb/>
            . to this end." So violent was the hatred of the multitude <lb/>
            towards him, that no free person dared to bury him; and he <lb/>
            was accordingly interred by slaves.</p>

            to restore Sicily, which had been disturbed by war for many <lb/>
            years, and harassed by barbarians,* to its former condition. <lb/>
            But in these undertakings he struggled not with one kind of <lb/>
            fortune only, and, what is thought the more difficult, he bore <lb/>
            good much more discreetly than evil fortune; for when his <lb/>
            brother Timophanes, on being chosen general by the <lb/>
            Corinthians, had made himself absolute by the aid of his <lb/>
            mercenary troops, and Timoleon himself might have shared <lb/>
            the sovereignty with him, he was so far from taking part in his <lb/>
            guilt, that he preferred the liberty of his countrymen to the life <lb/>
            of his brother, and thought it better to obey the laws of his <lb/>
            country than to rule over his country. With this feeling, he <lb/>
            contrived to have his brother the tyrant put to death by a <lb/>
            certain augur, a man connected with them both, as their sister <lb/>
            by the same parents† was married to him. He himself not <lb/>
            only did not put his hand to the work, but would not even look <lb/>
            upon his brother's blood; for, until the deed was done, he <lb/>
            kept himself at a distance on the watch, lest any of his brother's <lb/>
            guards should come to his aid. This most noble act of his was <lb/>
            not equally approved by all; for some thought that natural <lb/>
            affection had been violated by him, and endeavoured, from <lb/>
            envy, to lessen the praise of his virtue. His mother, indeed, <lb/>
            after this proceeding, would neither admit her son into her <lb/>
            house, nor look upon him, but, uttering imprecations against <lb/>
            him, called him a fratricide, and destitute of natural feeling. <lb/>
            With this treatment he was so much affected, that he was <lb/>
            sometimes inclined to put an end to his life, and withdraw <lb/>
            himself by death from the sight of his ungrateful fellow­ <lb/>
            creatures.</p>
          <p>II. In the meantime, after Dion was assassinated at <lb/>
            Syracuse, Dionysius again became master of that city, and his <lb/>
            enemies solicited assistance from the Corinthians, desiring a <lb/>
            general whose services they might employ in war. Timoleon. <lb/>
            being in consequence despatched thither, expelled Dionysius. <lb/>
            with wonderful success, quite out of Sicily. Though he might <lb/>
            have put him to death, he refused to do so, and secured him a <lb/>
            safe passage to Corinth, because the Corinthians had often <note type="footnote"> * A barbaris.] The Carthaginians, when they were at war with the <lb/>
            elder Dionysius. </note><note type="footnote"> t Soror ex iisdem parentibus nata.] She was whole sister to him and <lb/>

             <pb n="410"/>
            been supported by the aid of both the Dionysii, and he wished <lb/>
            the memory of that kindness to. be preserved, esteeming that <lb/>
            victory noble in which there was more clemency than cruelty; <lb/>
            and, finally, he wished it not only to be heard, but seen, what <lb/>
            a personage he bad reduced from such a height of power to so <lb/>
            low a condition. After the departure of Dionysius, he had <lb/>
            to go to war with Icetas, who had been the opponent of <lb/>
            Dionysius ; but that he did not disagree with him from hatred <lb/>
            of tyranny, but from a desire for it, this was a sufficient proof, <lb/>
            that after the expulsion of Dionysius he was unwilling to lay <lb/>
            down his command. Timoleon, after defeating Hicetas, put to <lb/>
            flight a vast army of the Carthaginians on the river Crimessus, <lb/>
            and obliged those who had now for several years maintained <lb/>
            their ground in Sicily, to be satisfied if they were allowed to <lb/>
            retain Africa. He took prisoner also Mamercus, an Italian <lb/>
            general, a man of great valour and influence, who had come <lb/>
            into Italy to support the tyrants.</p>
          <p>III. Having achieved these objects, and seeing not only the <lb/>
            lands, but also the cities, deserted through the long continuance <lb/>
            of the war, he assembled, in the first place, as many Sicilians <lb/>
            as he could, and then sent for settlers also from Corinth, <lb/>
            because it was by the Corinthians that Syracuse had been <lb/>
            originally founded. He gave back to the old inhabitants their <lb/>
            own lands, and divided such estates as had lost their owners in <lb/>
            the war, among the new colonists; he repaired the dilapidated <lb/>
            walls of the cities, and the neglected temples;* he restored <lb/>
            their laws and liberties to the several communities, and, after a <lb/>
            most destructive war, established such tranquillity through the <lb/>
            whole island, that he, and not those who had brought colonists <lb/>
            thither at first, might have been thought the founder of those <lb/>
            cities. The citadel of Syracuse, which Dionysius had built to <lb/>
            overawe the city, he demolished to its foundations; other <lb/>
            bulwarks of tyranny he removed, and exerted his efforts that <lb/>
            as few traces as possible of servitude might be left.</p>
          <p>Though he was possessed of so much influence that be <note type="footnote"> * Fana deserta.] Boa retains deserta in his text, but shows an incli­ <lb/>
            nation, in his note, to adopt the emendation of Lambinus, deleta; <lb/>
            deserta, however, which is found, I believe, in all the manuscripts, is <lb/>
            susceptible of a very good interpretation; for temples that were <lb/>
            deserted or neglected might have fallen into decay, and require to be <lb/>
            repaired or rebuilt. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="411"/>
            might have ruled the Syracusans even against their will, and <lb/>
            though he had so strongly gained the affection of all the <lb/>
            Sicilians that he might have assumed supreme power without <lb/>
            opposition from any one, he chose rather to be loved than to be <lb/>
            feared. He therefore laid down his authority as soon as he <lb/>
            could, and lived as a private person at Syracuse during the <lb/>
            remainder of his life. Nor did he act in this respect in­ <lb/>
            judiciously; for, what other rulers could scarcely effect by <lb/>
            absolute power, he attained by the good will of the people. <lb/>
            No honour was withheld from him; nor, when any public <lb/>
            business was afterwards transacted at Syracuse, was a decision <lb/>
            made upon it before Timoleon's opinion was ascertained. <lb/>
            Not only was no man's advice ever preferred to his, but no <lb/>
            man's was even compared to it; nor was this occasioned more <lb/>
            by the good will of others towards him, than by his own <lb/>
            prudence.</p>
          <p>IV. When he was advanced in age he lost the sight of his <lb/>
            eyes, without any apparent disease in them; a misfortune <lb/>
            which he bore with so much patience, that neither did any one <lb/>
            ever hear him complain, nor did he take a less part in private <lb/>
            and public business. He used to come to the theatre,* when <lb/>
            any assembly of the people was held there, riding in a <lb/>
            carriage by reason of his infirmity, and used to state from the <lb/>
            vehicle what he thought proper. Nor did any one impute this <lb/>
            to pride ; for nothing arrogant or boastful ever came out of his <lb/>
            mouth. Indeed when he heard his praises repeated, he never <lb/>
            made any other observation than that “ be paid and felt the <lb/>
            utmost gratitude to the immortal gods for this favour, that <lb/>
            when they had resolved on regenerating Sicily, they had <lb/>
            appointed him, above all others, to be the leader to execute <lb/>
            their will." For he thought that nothing in human affairs was <lb/>
            done without the directing power of the gods; and he therefore <lb/>
            erected a temple to Fortunet in his own house, and used to <lb/>
            worship at it most religiously.</p>
          <p>V. To this eminent virtue in his character were added <lb/>
            certain wonderful incidents in his life; for he fought all his <lb/>
            most remarkable battles on his birth-day; and hence it <note type="footnote"> * In theatrum.] Public assemblies were often held in theatres. </note><note type="footnote"> t Sacellum <foreign xml:lang="grc">Αὐτοματας</foreign>.] A word compounded of <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτος</foreign>, self, and <lb/>

            happened that all Sicily kept his birth-day as a festival <lb/>
            When one Lamestius, an impudent and ungrateful fellow, <lb/>
            wanted to compel him to give bail for his appearance, as he <lb/>
            said that he was merely dealing with him according to law, and <lb/>
            several persons, flocking about him, would have curbed the <lb/>
            insolence of the man by laying hands upon him, Timoleon <lb/>
            entreated them all " not to do so, for that he had encountered <lb/>
            extreme labours and dangers in order that Lamestius and <lb/>
            others might enjoy such privileges; since this was the true <lb/>
            form of liberty, if it were permitted to every one to try at <lb/>
            Jaw what he pleased." When a person, too, something like <lb/>
            Lamestius, by name Demænetus, had proceeded to detract <lb/>
            from his actions before an assembly of the people, and uttered <lb/>
            some invectives against Timoleon himself, he observed, that <lb/>
            “ he now enjoyed the fulfilment of his prayers,* for that he had <lb/>
            always made this his request to the immortal gods, that they <lb/>
            would re-establish that degree of liberty among the Syracusans. <lb/>
            in which it would be lawful for every mail to say what he <lb/>
            wished of any one with impunity." When he died, he was <lb/>
            buried at the public expense by the Syracusans, in the <lb/>
            Gymnasium, which is called the Timoleontean Gymnasium,! <lb/>

            Agesilaus the Lacedæmonian, he was a king in name, not in <lb/>
            power, just like the other Spartan kings. But of those who <lb/>
            were sovereigns with absolute authority, the most eminent <lb/>
            were, as we think, Cyrus, king of the Persians, and Darius, the <lb/>
            son of Hystaspes, both of whom, originally in a private <lb/>
            station, obtained thrones by merit. The first of these was <lb/>
            killed in battle among the Massagetæ; Darius died a natural <lb/>
            death at an advanced age. There are also three others of the <lb/>
            same nation; Xerxes and the two Artaxerxes, Macrochir and <lb/>
            Mnemon.* The most remarkable set of Xerxes was, that he <lb/>
            made war upon Greece, by land and sea, with the greatest <lb/>
            armies in the memory of man. Macrochir is greatly celebrated <lb/>
            for a most noble and handsome person, which he rendered still <lb/>
            more remarkable by extraordinary bravery in the field; for no <lb/>
            one of the Persians was more valorous in action than he. <lb/>
            Mnemon was renowned for his justice; for, when he lost his <lb/>

            resentment so far only, that filial duty overcame it.t Of these, <lb/>

            the rest in renown for their achievements; Philip, the son <lb/>
            of Amyntas, and Alexander the Great. One of these was cut <lb/>
            off by a disease at Babylon; Philip was killed by Pausanias, <lb/>
            near the theatre at Ӕgæ, when he was going to see the games. <lb/>
            Of Epirus, the only great king was Pyrrhus, who made war <lb/>
            upon the people of Rome; he was killed by a blow from a stone, <lb/>
            when he was besieging the city of Argos in the Peloponnesus. <lb/>
            There was also one great sovereign of Sicily, Dionysius the <note type="footnote"> contained the lives of kings, as Lambinus thinks; and Vossius de Hist. <lb/>
            Lat. i. 14, is of the same opinion. I rather imagine that the writings <lb/>
            of other authors, who have spoken of the acts of kings, are intended ; <lb/>
            for if Nepos had meant a composition of his own, he would have said <lb/>

            elder; for he was both brave in action and skilful in military <lb/>
            operations, and, what is not commonly found in a tyrant, was <lb/>
            far from being sensual, or luxurious, or avaricious, and was <lb/>
            covetous indeed of nothing but absolute and firmly-established <lb/>
            sovereignty; and to attain that object he was cruel; for in his <lb/>
            eagerness to secure it he spared the life of no one that he <lb/>
            thought to be plotting against it. After having gained <lb/>
            absolute power for himself by his abilities, he preserved it with <lb/>
            remarkable good fortune, and died at the age of more than <lb/>
            sixty, with his dominions in a flourishing condition. Nor in <lb/>
            the course of so many years did he see the funeral of any one of <lb/>
            his offspring, though he had children by three wives, and <lb/>
            several grand-children had been born to him.</p>
          <p>III. There arose also some great kings from among the <lb/>
            followers of Alexander the Great, who assumed regal authority <lb/>
            after his death. Among these were Antigonus, and his son <lb/>
            Demetrius, Lysimachus, Seleucus, and Ptolemy; of whom <lb/>
            Antigonus was killed in battle, when he was fighting against <lb/>
            Seleucus and Lysimachus; and Lysimachus was cut off in a <lb/>
            similar way by Seleucus, for the alliance between the two being <lb/>
            broken, they went to war with one another. Demetrius, after <lb/>
            he had given his daughter to Seleucus in marriage, and yet the <lb/>
            alliance between them could not be maintained the more <lb/>
            faithfully on that account, was taken prisoner in battle, and <lb/>
            died of some disease, the father-in-law in the custody of his son- <lb/>
            in-law. Not long after, Seleucus was treacherously killed by <lb/>
            Ptolemy Ceraunus, whom he had entertained, when he was <lb/>
            expelled by his father from Alexandria, and stood in need of <lb/>
            assistance from others. As for Ptolemy himself, he is said, <lb/>
            after having resigned his throne to his son during his life, to <lb/>
            have been deprived of life by that same son.</p>
          <p>But, as we think that sufficient has been said concerning <lb/>
            these, it seems proper not to omit Hamilcar and Hannibal, who, <lb/>

          <p>I. HAMILCAR the Carthaginian, the son of Hannibal, and <lb/>
            surnamed Barcas, began in the first Punic war, but towards <lb/>
            the end of it, to hold the command of the army in Sicily; <lb/>
            and though, before his coming, the efforts of the Carthaginians <lb/>
            were unsuccessful both by sea aDd land, he, after he arrived, <lb/>
            never gave way to the enemy,- or afforded them any oppor­ <lb/>
            tunity of doing him harm, but, on the contrary, often attacked <lb/>
            the foe when occasion presented itself, and always came off <lb/>
            with the advantage. Afterwards, though the Carthaginians <lb/>
            had lost almost every place in Sicily, he so ably defended <lb/>
            Eryx,† that there seemed to be no war going on there. In <lb/>
            the meantime, the Carthaginians, having been defeated at <lb/>
            sea, near the islands called Ægates,‡ by Caius Lutatius, the <lb/>
            Roman consul, resolved on putting an end to the war, and left <lb/>
            the settlement of the matter to the judgment of Hamilcar, <lb/>
            who, though he ardently desired to continue in arms, thought <lb/>
            it, nevertheless, necessary to submit to make peace, because he <lb/>
            saw that his country, exhausted by the expenses of the war, <lb/>
            was no longer in a condition to bear the pressure of it; but <lb/>
            such was his feeling on the occasion, that he soon meditated, <lb/>
            if the affairs of his country should be but in a small degree <lb/>
            improved, to resume the war, and to pursue the Romans with <lb/>
            hostilities, until they should indisputably obtain the mastery, <lb/>
            or, being conquered, should make submission. With this <lb/>
            resolution he concluded a peace, but showed such a spirit in <lb/>
            the transaction, that when Catulus refused to desist from hos­ <lb/>
            tilities unless Hamilcar, with such of his men as were in <note type="footnote"> * Nunquam hosti cessit.] Not exactly true; but he doubtless resisted <lb/>

            possession of Eryx, should lay down their arms and quit <lb/>
            Sicily, Hamilcar replied, that, though his country submitted, <lb/>
            he himself would rather perish on the spot than return home <lb/>
            under such disgrace, for that it was not consistent with his <lb/>
            spirit to resign to his enemies arms which he had received <lb/>
            from his country as a defence against enemies.</p>
          <p>II. Catulus yielded to his resolution. But Hamilcar, when <lb/>
            he arrived at Carthage, found the republic in a far different <lb/>
            condition than he had expected; for, through the long con­ <lb/>
            tinuance of foreign troubles, so violent a rebellion had broken <lb/>
            out at home, that Carthage was never in such danger, except <lb/>
            when it was actually destroyed. In the first place, the mer­ <lb/>
            cenary troops, who had served against the Romans, and the <lb/>
            number of whom amounted to twenty thousand, revolted; and <lb/>
            these drew the whole of Africa over to their side, and laid <lb/>
            siege to Carthage itself. With these disasters the Cartha­ <lb/>
            ginians were so much alarmed, that they requested aid even <lb/>
            from the Romans, and obtained it. But at last, when they <lb/>
            were almost sunk into despair, they made Hamilcar general, <lb/>
            who not only repulsed the enemy from the walls of Carthage, <lb/>
            though they amounted to a hundred thousand men in arms, but <lb/>
            reduced them to such a condition, that being shut up in a <lb/>
            confined space, they perished in greater numbers by famine <lb/>
            than by the sword. All the towns that had revolted, and <lb/>
            among them Utica and Hippo, the strongest cities of all Africa, <lb/>
            he brought back to their allegiance to his country. Nor was <lb/>
            he satisfied with these successes, but extended even the bounds <lb/>
            of the Carthaginian empire, and re-established such tranquillity <lb/>
            through all Africa, that there seemed to have been no war in <lb/>
            it for many years.</p>
          <p>III. These objects being executed according to his desire, <lb/>
            he then, by dint of a spirit confident and incensed against the <lb/>
            Romans, contrived, in order more easily to find a pretext for <lb/>
            going to war with them, to be sent as commander-in-chief with <lb/>
            an army into Spain, and took with him thither his son Hanni­ <lb/>
            bal, then nine years old. There also accompanied him a <lb/>
            young man named Hasdrubal, a person of high birth and <lb/>
            great beauty, who, as some said, was beloved by Hamilcar with <lb/>
            less regard to his character than was becoming; for so great a <lb/>
            man could not fail to have slanderers. Hence it happened <lb/>
            that Hasdrubal was forbidden by the censor of public morals <lb/>
             <pb n="417"/>
            to associate with him; but Hamilcar then gave him his <lb/>
            daughter in marriage, because, according to their usages, a <lb/>
            son-in-law could not be interdicted the society of his father-in- <lb/>
            law. We have inserted this notice of Hasdrubal, because, <lb/>
            after Hamilcar was killed, he took the command of the army, <lb/>
            and achieved great exploits; and he was also the first that <lb/>
            corrupted the ancient manners of the Carthaginians by <lb/>
            bribery. After his death Hannibal received the command <lb/>
            from the army.</p>
          <p>IV. Hamilcar, however, after he had crossed the sea, and <lb/>
            arrived in Spain, executed some great undertakings with excel­ <lb/>
            lent success; he subdued some very powerful and warlike <lb/>
            nations, and supplied all Africa with horses, arms, men, and <lb/>
            money. But as he was meditating to carry the war into <lb/>
            Italy, in the ninth year after his arrival in Spain, he was <lb/>
            killed in a battle with the Vettones.</p>
          <p>His constant hatred to the Romans seems to have been the <lb/>
            chief cause of producing the second Punic war; for Hannibal, <lb/>
            his son, was so wrought upon by the continual instigations of <lb/>
            his father, that he would have chosen to die rather than not <lb/>
            make trial of the Romans.</p>

          <p>I. HANNIBAL was the son of Hamilcar, and a native of <lb/>
            Carthage. If it be true, as no one doubts, that the Roman <lb/>
            people excelled all other nations in warlike merit, it is not to <lb/>
            be disputed that Hannibal surpassed other commanders in <lb/>
            ability as much as the Romans surpassed all other people in <note type="footnote"> B E </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="418"/>
            valour; for as often as he engaged with the Romans in Italy, he <lb/>
            always came off with the advantage; and, had not his efforts <lb/>
            been paralyzed by the envy of his countrymen at home, he <lb/>
            would appear to have been capable of getting the mastery over <lb/>
            the Romans. But the jealous opposition of many prevailed <lb/>
            against the ability of one. He, however, so cherished in his <lb/>
            mind the hatred which his father had borne the Romans, and <lb/>
            which was left him, as it were, by bequest, that he laid down <lb/>
            his life before he would abate it; for even when he was exiled <lb/>
            from his country, and stood in need of support from others, <lb/>
            he never ceased in thought to make war with the Romans.</p>
          <p>II. To say nothing of Philip,. whom he rendered an enemy <lb/>
            to the Romans, though at a distance from him, Antiochus was <lb/>
            the most powerful of all kings at that period; and him he so <lb/>
            inflamed with a desire for war, that he endeavoured to bring <lb/>
            troops against Italy even from the Red Sea.t As some <lb/>
            ambassadors from Rome were sent to that prince, in or ler tc <lb/>
            gain information respecting his intentions, and to endeavour. <unclear/><lb/>
            by underhand contrivances, to render Hannibal an object of <lb/>
            suspicion to the king (as if, being bribed by them, he <lb/>
            entertained other sentiments than before) ; and as they were <lb/>
            not unsuccessful in their attempts, and Hannibal became <lb/>
            aware of that fact, and found himself excluded from the privy <lb/>
            council, he went at a time appointed to the king himself, and, <lb/>
            after having said much concerning his attachment to him and <lb/>
            his hatred to the Romans, he added the following statement: <lb/>
            ‘My father Hamilcar," said he, “ when I was a very little boy, <lb/>
            being not more than nine years old, offered sacrifices at Car <lb/>
            thage, when he was going as commander into Spain, to Jupiter, <lb/>
            the best and greatest of the gods; and while this religious <lb/>
            ceremony was being performed, he asked me whether I should <lb/>
            like to go with him to the camp. As I willingly expressed my <lb/>
            consent, and proceeded to beg him not to hesitate to take me, <lb/>
            he replied, ‘ I will do so, if you will give me the promise which <lb/>
            I ask of you’ At the same time he led me to the altar at <lb/>
            which he had begun to sacrifice, and, sending the rest of the <lb/>
            company away, required me, taking hold of the altar, to swear <note type="footnote"> * Son of Demetrius, and last king but one of Macedonia. See <lb/>
            Justin, xxviii 4 ; xxix. 1—4 ; xxx. 3; xxxii. 2. </note><note type="footnote"> t A Rubro Mari.] It is the Mare Erythrœum that is meant, lying <lb/>
            between Arabia and India. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="419"/>
            that I would never be in friendship with the Romans. This <lb/>
            oath, thus taken before my father, I have so strictly kept ever: <lb/>
            to this day, that no man ought to doubt but that I shall be of <lb/>
            the same mind for the rest of my life. If, therefore, you <lb/>
            entertain any friendly thoughts towards the Romans, you will <lb/>
            not act imprudently if you conceal them from me ; but when­ <lb/>
            ever you prepare war, you will disappoint yourself unless you <lb/>
            constitute me leader in it."</p>
          <p>III. At this age, accordingly, he accompanied his father <lb/>
            into Spain. After his fathers death, when Hasdrubal was <lb/>
            made general-in-chief, he bad the command of all the cavalry. <lb/>
            When Hasdrubal also was killed, the army conferred upon <lb/>
            him the supreme command, and this act, when reported at <lb/>
            Carthage, received public approbation.</p>
          <p>Hannibal being thus made commander-in-chief, at the age of <lb/>
            five-and-twenty, subdued in war, during the next three years, <lb/>
            all the nations of Spain, took Saguntum, a city in alliance <lb/>
            with the Romans, by storm, and collected three vast armies, <lb/>
            of which he sent one into Africa, left another with his brother <lb/>
            Hasdrubal in Spain, and took the third with him into Italy. <lb/>
            He made his way through the forests of the Pyrenees,* he <lb/>
            engaged, wherever he directed his course, with all the inhabit­ <lb/>
            ants of the country, and let none go unconquered. On <lb/>
            arriving at the Alps, which separate Italy from Gaul, and <lb/>
            which no one had ever crossed with an army before him, <lb/>
            (except Hercules the Greek, from which achievement the forest <lb/>
            there is now called the Grecian forest), he cut to pieces the <lb/>
            people of the Alps who endeavoured to prevent his passage, <lb/>
            laid open those parts, made roads, and put things in such a <lb/>
            state, that an elephant fully equipped could walk where pre­ <lb/>
            viously one unarmed man could scarcely crawl. Along this <lb/>
            tract he led his army, and arrived in Italy.</p>
          <p>IV. On the banks of the Rhone he engaged with the consul <lb/>
            Publius Cornelius Scipio, and put him to flight. At the <lb/>
            Po he fought with the same consul for the possession of <lb/>
            Clastidium,t and expelled him from that place wounded and <note type="footnote"> * Soltum Pyrenœum.] The forest, i.e. the woody chain or range of <lb/>

            Longus, came against him a third time at the Trebia; he <lb/>
            came to battle with them, and put both of them to flight. <lb/>
            He then passed through the country of the Ligurians over <lb/>
            the chain of the Apennnines, directing his course towards <lb/>
            Etruria. During this march he was afflicted with so violent <lb/>
            a distemper in his eyes, that he never had the use of his right <lb/>
            eye so well afterwards. But even when he was troubled with <lb/>
            this malady, and carried in a litter, he cut off Caius Flaminius <lb/>
            the consul at the lake Trasimenus, being caught with his <lb/>
            army in an ambush ; and not long after he killed the prætor <lb/>
            Caius Centenius, who was occupying the forest with a choice <lb/>
            body of troops. He then proceeded into Apulia, where the <lb/>
            two consuls, Caius Terentius Varro, and Paulus Ӕmilius, <lb/>
            met him, both of whose armies he routed in one battle; the <lb/>
            consul Paulus he killed, with several others of consular <lb/>
            dignity, and among them Cnæus Servilius Geminus, who had <lb/>

          <p>V. After fighting this battle, he marched towards Rome, <lb/>
            nobody opposing him, and halted on the hills near the city. <lb/>
            When he had lain encamped there some days, and was <lb/>
            turning back towards Capua, Quintus Fabius Maximus, the <lb/>
            Roman dictator, threw himself in his way in the Falemian <lb/>
            territory. Here, though enclosed in a confined space, he <lb/>
            extricated himself without any loss to his army. He deceived <lb/>
            Fabius, a most skilful commander; for, when night had come <lb/>
            on, he set fire to some bundles of twigs, tied upon the horns <lb/>
            of oxen, and drove forward a vast number of those cattle, <lb/>
            scattering themselves hither and thither. By presenting <lb/>
            this object suddenly to their view,. he struck such terror <lb/>
            into the army of the Romans, that nobody ventured to stir <lb/>
            beyond the rampart. Not many days after this success, he <lb/>
            put to flight Marcus Minucius Rufus, master of the horse, <lb/>
            who was equal in power with the dictator, and who had been <lb/>
            drawn into an engagement by a stratagem. While he was at <note type="footnote"> latter, as the termination in o is found in all the manuscripts. But DO <lb/>

            town of Gallia Cispadana, at no great distance from the Po), is found <lb/>
            in any other author. Ithe has therefore ventured, somewhat boldly, <lb/>
            to eject Clastidio from his text altogether. </note><note type="footnote"> * Quo repentino objectu viso.] “ Which sudden appearance being seen” <lb/>

            a distance, too, he cut off* Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus, <lb/>
            consul for the second time, in the country of the Lucanians, after <lb/>
            he had been inveigled into an ambush. In like manner he <lb/>
            caused the death of Marcus Claudius Marcellus, consul for <lb/>
            the fifth time, at Venusia. To enumerate his battles would <lb/>
            occupy too much time; and this one observation, accordingly, <lb/>
            (from which it will be understood how great a general he was), <lb/>
            will be sufficient, that, as long as he continued in Italy, none <lb/>
            made a stand against him in a regular engagement, none, <lb/>
            after the battle of Cannæ, pitched a camp against him in the <lb/>
            field.</p>
          <p>VI. Being recalled, without having suffered any defeat, to <lb/>
            defend his country, he maintained a war with the son of that <lb/>
            Publius Scipio whom he had routed first on the Rhone, again <lb/>
            on the Po, and a third time on the Trebia. As the resources <lb/>
            of his country were now exhausted, he wished, by a treaty <lb/>
            with him, to put a stop to the war for a time, in order that he <lb/>
            might engage in it afterwards with greater vigour. He came <lb/>
            to a conference with him, but the conditions were not agreed <lb/>
            upon. A few days after this meeting, he came to battle with <lb/>
            Scipio at Zama; and being defeated (incredible to relate !) <lb/>
            he made his way to Adrumetum, which is about three <lb/>
            hundred miles t from Zama, in two days and two nights. <lb/>
            In the course of his retreat, some Numidians, who had left <lb/>
            the field in his company, formed a conspiracy against him; <lb/>
            however he not only escaped them, but deprived them of life. <lb/>
            At Adrumetum he assembled those who had survived the <lb/>
            defeat, and, with the aid of new levies, drew together, in a <lb/>
            few days, a numerous force.</p>
          <p>VII. While he was most vigorously engaged in preparing <lb/>
            for action, the Carthaginians made an end of the war by a <lb/>
            treaty with the Romans. He had nevertheless afterwards the <lb/>
            command of the army, and continued to act, as well as his <lb/>
            brother Mago, in Africa, until the time when Publius Sulpicius <lb/>
            and Caius Aurelius became consuls; for, during their term <lb/>
            of office, ambassadors from Carthage went to Rome, to thank <lb/>
            the Roman senate and people for having made peace with <note type="footnote"> * Absent—sustudit The battle being fought by one of Hannibal's <lb/>

            them, and to present them, on that account, with a crown of <lb/>
            gold, requesting, at the same time, that their hostages might <lb/>
            reside at Fregellæ,* and that their prisoners might be re­ <lb/>
            stored. An answer was made them, by a resolution of the <lb/>
            senate, that “ their present was acceptable and welcome, and <lb/>
            that their hostages should live in, the place which they <lb/>
            desired, but that they would not restore the prisoners, because <lb/>
            the Carthaginians retained Hannibal, by whose acts the war <lb/>
            had been occasioned, and who was the bitterest of enemies to the <lb/>
            name of Rome, in command of the army, as also his brother <lb/>
            Mago." The Carthaginians, on hearing this answer, recalled <lb/>
            Hannibal and Mago home. When he returned, he was made <lb/>
            prætor,† in the two-and-twentieth year after he had been <lb/>
            appointed king; ‡ for, as consuls are elected at Rome, so, at <lb/>
            Carthage, two kings are annually chosen, retaining their office <lb/>
            for a year. In that post Hannibal conducted himself with <lb/>
            the same activity as he had exhibited in war; for he took care, <lb/>
            not only that there should be money raised from new taxes, <lb/>
            to be paid to the Romans according to the treaty, but that <lb/>
            there should be a surplus to be deposited in the treasury.</p>
          <p>In the year after his prætorship, when Marcus Claudius <lb/>
            and Lucius Furius were consuls, ambassadors from Rome came <lb/>
            again to Carthage; and Hannibal, supposing that they were <lb/>
            sent to demand that he should be delivered to the Romans, <lb/>
            went secretly, before an audience of the senate was given them, <lb/>
            on board a vessel, and fled into Syria to Antiochus. His <lb/>
            departure being made public, the Carthaginians sent two <lb/>
            ships to seize him, if they could overtake him. His property <lb/>
            they confiscated; his house they razed to its foundations; <lb/>
            and himself they declared an outlaw.</p>
          <p>VIII. In the third year, however, after he had fled from home, <lb/>
            and in the consulship of Lucius Cornelius and Quintus Minu­ <lb/>
            cius, Hannibal landed with five ships in Africa, on the coast <lb/>
            of the Cyrenæans, to try if he could move the Carthaginians <lb/>
            to war, by giving them hope and confidence in Antiochus, <note type="footnote"> * A town on the Liris, in the Volscian territory. </note><note type="footnote"> + Prœtor.] This office seems, from what follows, to have been in a <lb/>

            whom he had now persuaded to proceed with his forces to <lb/>
            Italy. Thither he summoned his brother Mago ; and, when <lb/>
            the Carthaginians knew of the circumstance, they inflicted <lb/>
            on Mago the same penalties as they had laid on his absent <lb/>
            brother. When they had let loose their vessels, and sailed <lb/>
            off, in despair of success, Hannibal went to join Antiochus. Of <lb/>
            Mago's end two accounts have been given ; for some have <lb/>
            left on record that he perished by shipwreck, others that he <lb/>
            was killed by his own slaves.</p>
          <p>Antiochus, if he had been as ready to obey Hannibal's <lb/>
            advice in conducting the war as he had resolved to be when <lb/>
            he undertook it, might have fought for the empire of the <lb/>
            world nearer the Tiber than Thermopylæ.* Hannibal, however, <lb/>
            though he saw him attempt many things imprudently, left him <lb/>
            in nothing unsupported. He took the command of a few ships, <lb/>
            which he had been directed to bring from Syria into Asia, <lb/>
            and with these he engaged the fleet of the Rhodians in the <lb/>
            Pamphylian sea,t and though his men were overpowered in <lb/>
            the struggle by the number of the enemy, he had the advan <lb/>
            tage himself in the wing in which he acted.</p>
          <p>JX. After Antiochus was put to flight,t Hannibal, fearing <lb/>
            that he should be delivered to the Romans (an event which <lb/>
            would doubtless have come to pass, if he had given the king <lb/>
            an opportunity of securing him), went off to the people of <lb/>
            Gortyn, in Crete, that he might there consider in what place <lb/>
            he should settle himself. But, as he was the most perspica­ <lb/>
            cious of all men, he saw that unless he took some precautions, <lb/>
            he should be in great danger from the covetousness of the <lb/>
            Cretans ; for he carried with him a large sum of money, of <lb/>
            which he knew that a report had gone abroad. He therefore <lb/>
            adopted the following contrivance ; he filled several pots with <lb/>
            lead, covering the upper part with gold and silver, and de­ <lb/>
            posited them, in the presence of the leading men§, in the <lb/>
            temple of Diana, pretending that he trusted his fortune to <note type="footnote"> * Antiochus here suffered a defeat from the Romans. </note><note type="footnote"> t In Pamphylio mart ] The sea on the coast of Pamphylia in Asia <lb/>

            their honesty Having thus deceived them, he filled the <lb/>
            whole of some brazen statues, which he carried with him, with <lb/>
            his money, and threw them down in an open place at his own <lb/>
            residence. The Gortynians, meanwhile, guarded the temple <lb/>
            with extreme care, not so much against others as against <lb/>
            Hannibal himself, lest he should remove any thing without <lb/>
            their knowledge, and carry it off with him.</p>
          <p>X. The Carthaginian, having thus saved his property, and <lb/>
            deceived all the Cretans, went into Pontus to Prusias, with <lb/>
            whom he showed himself of the same mind as to Italy; <lb/>
            for he did nothing but excite the king to arms, and animate <lb/>
            him against the Romans, and seeing that he was not at all <lb/>
            strong in domestic resources, he induced other princes to join <lb/>
            him, and united warlike nations on his side. Eumenes, king <lb/>
            of Pergamus, wrs at variance with Prusias, and war was main­ <lb/>
            tained between them by sea and land, for which reason <lb/>
            Hannibal was the more desirous that he should be crushed. <lb/>
            Eumenes had the superiority on both elements, and Hannibal <lb/>
            thought that, if he could but cut him off, his other projects <lb/>
            would be easier of execution. To put an end to his life, <lb/>
            therefore, he adopted the following stratagem. They were to <lb/>
            engage by sea in a few days; Hannibal was inferior in number <lb/>
            of vessels, and had to use art in the contest, as he was no <lb/>
            match for his enemy in force. He accordingly ordered as <lb/>
            many poisonous serpents as possible to be brought together <lb/>
            alive, and to be put into earthen vessels, of which when he had <lb/>
            collected a large number, he called the officers of his ships <lb/>
            together, on the day on which he was going to fight at sea, <lb/>
            and directed them all to make an attack upon the single ship <lb/>
            of King Eumenes, and to be content with simply defending <lb/>
            themselves against others, as they might easily do with the <lb/>
            aid of the vast number of serpents; adding that he would <lb/>
            take care they should know in what ship Eumenes sailed, <lb/>
            and promising that, if they took or killed him, it should be of <lb/>
            great advantage to them.</p>
          <p>XI. After this exhortation was given to the soldiers, the <lb/>
            fleets were brought out for action by both parties. When the <lb/>
            line of each was formed, and before the signal was given for <lb/>
            battle, Hannibal, in order to show his men where Eumenes <lb/>
            was, despatched to him a letter-carrier in a boat with a <lb/>
            herald's staff; who, when he reached the enemy's line of <lb/>
             <pb n="425"/>
            vessels, held out a letter, and signified that he was looking for <lb/>
            the king; he was therefore immediately taken to Eumenes. <lb/>
            because nobody doubted that there was something written in <lb/>
            the letter relating to peace. The messenger, having thus <lb/>
            made the king's ship known to his party, returned to the <lb/>
            same place from which he had come. Eumenes, on opening <lb/>
            the letter, found nothing in it but what was meant to ridicule <lb/>
            him; and though he wondered as to the motive of it, and <lb/>
            none could be discovered, yet he did not hesitate to come at <lb/>
            nee to battle. In the conflict, the Bithyniaus, according to <lb/>
            the direction of Hannibal, fell all at once upon the ship of <lb/>
            Eumenes. That prince, as he was unable to withstand then <lb/>
            onset, sought safety in flight, but would not have found it, <lb/>
            nad he not taken refuge behind his guards, which had been <lb/>
            posted on the neighbouring shore. As the rest of the Per­ <lb/>
            gamenian ships bore hard upon the enemy, the earthen pots, <lb/>
            of which we have previously spoken, began suddenly to be <lb/>
            hurled into them. These, when thrown, at first excited <lb/>
            laughter among the combatants, nor could it be conceived why <lb/>
            such a thing was done; but when they saw their ships filled <lb/>
            with serpents, and, startled at the strangeness of the oc­ <lb/>
            currence, knew not what to avoid first, they put about their <lb/>
            ships, and retreated to their camp upon the coast. Thus <lb/>
            Hannibal, by his stratagem, prevailed over the force of the <lb/>
            Pergamenians. Nor was this the only occasion; but often, at <lb/>
            other times, he defeated the enemy with his troops on <lb/>
            land, and with equally skilful management.</p>
          <p>XII. While these transactions were taking place in Asia, <lb/>
            it happened accidentally at Rome that certain ambassadors <lb/>
            from Prusias took supper at the house of Lucius Quintius <lb/>
            Flamininus, one of the consuls; and there, as mention was <lb/>
            made of Hannibal, one of them observed that he was in the <lb/>
            dominions of Prusias. This information Flamininus commu­ <lb/>
            nicated the next day to the senate. The conscript fathers, <lb/>
            who thought that they would never be free from plots as long <lb/>
            as Hannibal was alive, sent ambassadors to Bithynia, and <lb/>
            among them Flamininus, to request the king not to keep <lb/>
            their bitterest enemy with him, but to deliver him up to them. <lb/>
            To this embassy Prusias did not dare to give a refusal; he <lb/>
            made some opposition, however, to one point, begging them <lb/>
             <pb n="426"/>
            not tc require of him* what was contrary to the rights of <lb/>
            hospitality, saying that they themselves might make Hannibal <lb/>
            prisoner, if they could, as they would easily find out the place <lb/>
            where he was. Hannibal indeed confined himself to one <lb/>
            place, living in a fortress which had been given him by the <lb/>
            king; and this he had so constructed that it had outlets on <lb/>
            every side of the building, always fearing lest that should <lb/>
            happen which eventually came to pass. When the Roman <lb/>
            ambassadors had gone thither, and had surrounded his house <lb/>
            with a number of men, a slave, looking out at a gate, told <lb/>
            Hannibal that several armed men were to be seen, contrary to <lb/>
            what was usual. Hannibal desired him to go round to all the <lb/>
            gates of the castle, and bring him word immediately whether <lb/>
            it was beset in the same way on all sides. The slave having <lb/>
            soon reported how it was, and informed him, that all the passages <lb/>
            were secured, he felt certain that it was no accidental occur­ <lb/>
            rence, but that his person was menaced, and that his life was <lb/>
            no longer to be preserved. That he might not part with it, <lb/>
            however, at the pleasure of another, and dwelling on the <lb/>
            remembrance of his past honours, he took poison, which he <lb/>
            had been accustomed always to carry with him.</p>
          <p>XIII. Thus this bravest of men, after having gone through <lb/>
            many and various labours, found repose in the seventieth year <lb/>
            of his age. Under what consuls he died, is not agreed; for <lb/>
            Atticus has left it recorded in his chronicle that he ended his <lb/>
            life in the consulship of Marcus Claudius Marcellus and <lb/>
            Quintus Fabius Labeo ; but Polybius says in that of Lucius <lb/>
            .Emilius Paullus and Cnæus Bæbius Tamphilus; and Sulpi. <lb/>
            cius in that of Publius Cornelius Cethegus and Marcus Bæbius <lb/>
            Tamphilus.</p>
          <p>This great man, though occupied in such vast military <lb/>
            operations, devoted some portion of his time to literature; <lb/>
            for there are some books of his written in the Greek language, <lb/>
            and amongst them one addressed to the Rhodians on the acts <lb/>
            of Cnæus Manlius Vulso in Asia.</p>
          <p>Of the wars which he conducted many have given the <lb/>
            history ; and two of them were persons that were with him <lb/>
            in the camp, and lived with him as long as fortune allowed, <note type="footnote"> * Illud recusavit, ne id a se fieri pstularent.] “ He refused this, (re­ <lb/>
            questing) that they would not require that to be done by him." </note> <lb/>

            8ilenus and Sosilus the Lacedæmonian; and this Sosilus <lb/>
            Hannibal had as his instructor in the Greek language.</p>
          <p>But it is now time to make an end of this book, and to <lb/>
            give an account of commanders among the Romans, that, <lb/>
            when the actions of both are compared, it may be the better <lb/>

          <p>I. CATO,. born in the municipal town of Tusculum,t resided, <lb/>
            when a very young man, and before he turned his attention to <lb/>
            the attainment of office, in the territory of the Sabines, because <lb/>
            he had an estate there which had been left him by his father. <lb/>
            It was at the persuasion of Lucius Valerius Flaccus, whom he <lb/>
            had for a colleague in his consulate and censorship, that he <lb/>
            removed, as Marcus Perpema Censorius was accustomed to <lb/>
            relate, to Rome, and proceeded to employ himself in the forum. <lb/>
            He served his first campaign at the age of seventeen, in the <lb/>
            consulship of Quintus Fabius Maximus and Marcus Claudius <lb/>
            Marcellus. He was military tribune in Sicily. When he <lb/>
            returned from thence, he attached himself to the staff of Caius <lb/>
            Claudius Nero, and his service was thought of great value in the <lb/>
            battle near Sena, in which Hasdrubal, the brother of Hannibal, <lb/>
            fell. As quæstor, he happened to be under the consul, Publius <lb/>
            Cornelius Scipio Africanus, with whom he did not live <lb/>
            according to the intimate connexion of his office; for he was <lb/>
            at variance with him during his whole life. He was made <lb/>
            ædile of the commons ‡ with Caius Helvius. As prætor he had <lb/>
            the province of Sardinia, from which, when he was returning <note type="footnote"> * Cato the censor, the great grandfather of the Cato that killed <lb/>

            from Africa some time before in the character of quæstor, he <lb/>
            had brought Quintus Ennius, the poet, an act which we value <lb/>
            not less than the noblest triumph that Sardinia could have <lb/>
            afforded.</p>
          <p>II. He held the consulship with Lucius Valerius Flaccus, <lb/>
            and had by lot Hither Spain for his province, from which he <lb/>
            gained a triumph. As he stayed there a long time, Publius <lb/>
            Scipio Africanus, when consul for the second time, wanted to <lb/>
            remove him from his province, and to succeed him himself, but <lb/>
            was unable, through the senate, to effect that object, even <lb/>
            though he then possessed the greatest authority in the state; <lb/>
            for the government was then conducted, not with regard for <lb/>
            personal influence, but according to justice. Being displeased <lb/>
            with the senate on this account, Scipio, after his consulship <lb/>
            was ended, remained in the city as a private person.*</p>
          <p>Cato, being made censor with the Flaccus above mentioned, <lb/>
            exercised that office with severity; for he inflicted penalties on <lb/>
            many noblemen, and introduced many new regulations into <lb/>
            his edict,! by means of which luxury, which was even then <lb/>
            beginning to germinate, might be repressed. For about eighty <lb/>
            years.‡ from his youth to the end of his life, he never ceased to <lb/>
            incur enmity in behalf of the commonwealth. Though <lb/>
            attacked by many,§ he not only suffered no loss of character, <lb/>
            but increased in reputation for virtue as long as he lived.</p>
          <p>III. In all his pursuits he gave proofs of singular in­ <lb/>
            telligence and industry; for he was a skilful agriculturist, <lb/>
            well-informed in political affairs, experienced in the law, an <note type="footnote"> * Privatus in urbe mansit.] That is, he did not take any other <lb/>

            to procure from the senate a vote of censure on Cato's administration, <lb/>

            eminent commander, a respectable orator. He was also much <lb/>
            devoted to literature, and though he had entered on the study <lb/>
            of it at an advanced age, yet he made such progress in it, that <lb/>
            you could not easily discover anything, either in Grecian or <lb/>
            Italian history, that was unknown to him. From his youth he <lb/>
            composed speeches. In his old age he began to write his <lb/>
            Histories, of which there are ten books. The first contains the <lb/>
            acts of the kings of Rome; the second and third show from <lb/>
            whence each Italian state had its rise, for which reason he <lb/>
            seems to have called the whole body of them Origines: in the <lb/>
            fourth is related the first Carthaginian war; in the fifth the <lb/>
            second; and all these subjects are treated in a summary way. <lb/>
            Other wars he has narrated in a similar manner, down to the <lb/>
            prætorship of Lucius Galba, who spoiled the Lusitanians. <lb/>
            The leaders in these wars, however, he has not named, but has <lb/>
            stated the facts without the names. In the same books he has <lb/>
            given an account of whatever seemed remarkable in Italy and <lb/>
            Spain ; and there are shown in them much labour and industry, <lb/>
            and much learning.</p>

          <p>I. TITUS POMPONIUS ATTICUS, descended from a most <lb/>
            ancient Roman family,. held the equestrian rank received in <lb/>
            uninterrupted succession from his ancestors. He had a father <lb/>
            who was active, indulgent, and, as times then were, wealthy, <lb/>
            as well as eminently devoted to literature; and, as he loved <lb/>
            learning himself, he instructed his son in all branches of <lb/>
            knowledge with which youth ought to be made acquainted. In <lb/>
            the boy, too, besides docility of disposition, there was great <lb/>
            sweetness of voice, so that he not only imbibed rapidly what <lb/>
            was taught him, but repeated it extremely well. He was in <lb/>
            consequence distinguished among his companions in his boy­ <lb/>
            hood, and shone forth with more lustre than his noble <lb/>
            fellow-students could patiently bear; hence he stirred them all <lb/>
            to new exertions by his application. In the number of them <lb/>
            were Lucius Torquatus, Caius Marius the younger, and <lb/>
            Marcus Cicero, whom he so attached to himself by his inter­ <lb/>
            course with them, that no one was ever more dear to them.</p>
          <p>II. His father died at an early age. He himself, in his <lb/>
            youth, on account of his connexion with Publius Sulpicius, who <note type="footnote"> * Ab origine ultimd stirpis Romanœ.] “ From the most remote origin <lb/>
            of the Roman race." His family was so old that it reached back to <lb/>
            the earliest age of Rome. </note> <lb/>

            was killed when tribune of the people, was not unapprehensive <lb/>
            of sharing in his danger; for Anicia, Pomponius's cousin, was <lb/>
            married to Marcus Servius, the brother of Sulpicius. When <lb/>
            he saw that the state, therefore, after the death of Sulpicius, <lb/>
            was thrown into confusion by the disturbances of Cinna, and <lb/>
            that no facility was allowed him of living suitably to his <lb/>
            dignity without offending one side or the other (the feelings of <lb/>
            the citizens being divided, as some favoured the party of Sylla <lb/>
            and others that of Cinna) he thought it a proper time for <lb/>
            devoting himself to his studies, and betook himself to Athens. <lb/>
            He nevertheless, however, assisted young Marius, when <lb/>
            declared an enemy, by such means as he could, and relieved <lb/>
            him in his exile with money. And, lest his sojourn in a <lb/>
            foreign country should cause any detriment to his estate, he <lb/>
            transported thither a great portion of his fortune. Here he <lb/>
            lived in such a manner, that he was deservedly much beloved <lb/>
            by all the Athenians; for, in addition to his interest, which <lb/>
            was great for so young a man, he relieved their public <lb/>
            exigencies from his own property; since, when the government <lb/>
            was obliged to borrow money,- and had no fair offer of it, he <lb/>
            always came to their aid, and in such a way, that he never <lb/>
            received any interest of them, and never allowed them to be <lb/>
            indebted to him longer than had been agreed upon; both which <lb/>
            modes of acting were for their advantage, for he neither <lb/>
            suffered their debt to grow old upon them, nor to be increased <lb/>
            by an accumulation of interest. He enhanced this kindness <lb/>
            also by other instances of liberality; for he presented the <lb/>
            whole of the people with such a supply of corn, that seven <lb/>
            modii t of wheat (a kind of measure which is called a <lb/>
            medimnus at Athens) were allotted to each person. <note type="footnote"> * Versuram faccre.] Vesura, according to Festus sub voce, properly <lb/>
            signifies borrowing from one to pay another. Our language has no <lb/>
            word corresponding to it. </note><note type="footnote"> t Septem modii.] This is the reading of the old editions, and of the <lb/>
            manuscripts of Manutius, Gifanius, Schottus, Leid. and Medic. 2. But <lb/>
            since it appears from Cicero in Verr. iii. 45, 46, 49, as well as from <lb/>
            Ausonius, Suidas, and other ancient writers, that the medimnus con­ <lb/>
            tained six modii, Manutius, Faemus, and Ursinus, following Georg. <lb/>
            Agricola de Mens. et Pond. Gr. et Rom. lib. ii, substituted sex for <lb/>
            septem in this passage, and Lambinus, with all the subsequent editors <lb/>
            of Nepos, adopted it. There seem, however, to have been variations <lb/>
            in the content of the medimni and modii. According to the old <lb/>

          <p>III. He also conducted himself in such a way, that he <lb/>
            appeared familiar with the lowest, though on a level with the <lb/>
            highest. Hence it happened that they publicly bestowed upon <lb/>
            him all the honours that they could, and offered to make him a <lb/>
            citizen of Athens; an offer which he would not accept, because <lb/>
            some are of opinion that the citizenship of Rome is forfeited by <lb/>
            taking that of another city. As long as he was among them, <lb/>
            he prevented any statue from being erected to him; but when <lb/>
            absent, he could not hinder it; and they accordingly raised <lb/>
            several statues both to him and Phidias,* in the most sacred <lb/>
            places, for, in their whole management of the state, they took <lb/>
            him for their agent and adviser. It was the gift of fortune, <lb/>
            then, in the first place, that he was born in that city, above all <lb/>
            others, in which was the seat of the empire of the world, and <lb/>
            had it not only for his native place but for his home; and, in <lb/>
            the next, it was a proof of his wisdom, that when he betook <lb/>
            himself to a city which excelled all others in antiquity, polite­ <lb/>
            ness, and learning, he became individually dear to it beyond <lb/>
            other men.</p>
          <p>IV. When Sylla arrived at Athens in his journey from Asia, <lb/>
            he kept Pomponius in his company as long as he remained <lb/>
            there, being charmed with the young man's politeness and <lb/>
            knowledge; for he spoke Greek so well that he might have <lb/>
            been thought to have been born at Athens; while there was <lb/>
            such agreeableness in his Latin style, as to make it evident <lb/>
            that the graces of it were natural, not acquired. He also <lb/>
            recited verses, both in Greek and Latin, in so pleasing a <lb/>
            manner that nothing could have been added to its attractions. <lb/>
            It was in consequence of these accomplishments that Sylla <lb/>
            would never suffer him to be out of his company, and wanted <lb/>
            to take him away with him to Rome. But when he <lb/>
            endeavoured to persuade him to go, " Do not desire, I entreat <lb/>
            you," replied Pomponius, “ to lead me with you against those, <lb/>
            with whom, that I might not bear arms against you, I quitted <note type="footnote"> Finium Regwndorum, p. 335, five modii made a medimnus ; and Isidore, <lb/>

            says that the medimnus was <foreign xml:lang="grc">μόδ ιοι ἑπτα</foreign>.—Bos. On the whole, there­ <lb/>

             <pb n="433"/>
            Italy." Sylla, commending the good feeling of the young man, <lb/>
            directed, at his departure, that all the presents which he had <lb/>
            received at Athens should be carried to his house.</p>
          <p>Though he resided at Athens many years, paying such <lb/>
            attention to his property as a not unthrifty father of a family <lb/>
            ought to pay, and devoting all the rest of his time either to. <lb/>
            literature or to the public affairs of the Athenians, he never­ <lb/>
            theless afforded his services to his friends at Rome; for he <lb/>
            used to come to their elections, and whatever important busi­ <lb/>
            ness of theirs was brought forward, he was never found wanting <lb/>
            on the occasion. Thus he showed a singular fidelity to Cicero <lb/>
            in all his perils; and presented him, when he was banished <lb/>
            from his country, with the sum of two hundred and fifty <lb/>
            sestertia.* And when the affairs of the Romans became <lb/>
            tranquil, he returned to Rome, in the consulship, as I believe, <lb/>
            of Lucius Cotta and Lucius Torquatus; and the whole city of <lb/>
            Athens observed the day of his departure in such a manner, <lb/>
            that they testified by their tears the regret which they would <lb/>
            afterwards feel for him.</p>
          <p>V. He had an uncle, Quintus Cæcilius, a Roman knight, an <lb/>
            intimate friend of Lucius Lucullus, a rich man, but of a very <lb/>
            morose temper, whose peevishness he bore so meekly, that he <lb/>
            retained without interruption, to the extremity of old age, the <lb/>
            good will of a person whom no one else could endure. In <lb/>
            consequence, he reaped the fruit of his respectful conduct; for <lb/>
            Cæcilius, at his death, adopted him by his will, and made him <lb/>
            heir to three-fourths of his estate, from which bequest he <lb/>
            received about ten thousand sestertia.t</p>
          <p>A sister of Atticus was married to Quintus Tullius Cicero; <lb/>
            and Marcus Cicero had been the means of forming the con <lb/>
            nexion, a man with whom Atticus had lived in the closest <lb/>
            intimacy from the time that they were fellow-students, in <lb/>
            much greater intimacy, indeed, than with Quintus; whence it <lb/>
            may be concluded that, in establishing friendship, similarity of <lb/>
            manners has more influence than affinity. He was likewise <lb/>
            so intimate with Quintus Hortensius, who, in those times, had <lb/>
            the highest reputation for eloquence, that it could not be <lb/>
            decided which of the two had the greater love for him, Cicero <lb/>
            or Hortensius; and he succeeded in effecting what was most <note type="footnote"> * About £1600 of our money. </note><note type="footnote"> + About £80,729 3s. 4d. </note> <note type="footnote"> F F </note> <lb/>

            difficult, namely, that no enmity should occur between those <lb/>
            between whom there was emulation for such eminence, and <lb/>
            that he himself should be the bond of union between such <lb/>
            great men.</p>
          <p>VI. He conducted himself in such a manner in political <lb/>
            affairs, that he always was, and always was thought to be, on <lb/>
            the best side ; * yet he did not mingle in civil tumults, because <lb/>
            he thought that those who had plunged into them were not <lb/>
            more under their own control than those who were tossed by <lb/>
            the waves of the sea. He aimed at no offices (though they <lb/>

            exercised for the good of the country without danger in so <lb/>
            corrupt a state of the public morals. He never went to a public <lb/>
            sale,t nor ever became surety or farmer in any department of <lb/>
            the public revenue.‡ He accused no one, either in his own <lb/>
            name or as a subscriber to an accusation. § He never went to <lb/>
            law about property of his own, nor was ever concerned in a <lb/>
            trial. Offers of places, under several consuls and prætors, he <lb/>
            received in such a way as never to follow any one into his <lb/>
            province, being content with the honour, and not solicitous to <lb/>
            make any addition to his property ; for he would not even go <lb/>
            into Asia with Quintus Cicero, when he might have held the <lb/>
            office of legate under him ; for he did not think it became him, <lb/>
            after he had declined to take the prætorship,|| to become the <lb/>
            attendant on a prætor. In such conduct he consulted not only <note type="footnote"> * Optimarum partium.] Ursinus and Schottus conjecture optimatum <lb/>

            farmer. </note><note type="footnote"> § Neque suo nomine neque subscribens.] He neither brought accusations <lb/>

            his dignity but his quiet; since -he avoided even the suspicion <lb/>
            of evil practices. Hence it happened that attentions received <lb/>
            from him * were more valued by all, as they saw that they were <lb/>
            attributable to kindness, not to fear or hope.</p>
          <p>VII. When he was about sixty years old, the civil war with <lb/>
            Cæsar broke out; but he availed himself of the privilege of <lb/>
            his age, and went nowhere out of the city. Whatever was <lb/>
            needful for his friends when going to Pompey, he supplied for <lb/>
            them out of his own property. To Pompey himself, who was <lb/>
            his intimate friend, he gave no offence; for he had accepted no <lb/>
            distinction from him like others, who had gained honours or <lb/>
            wealth by his means, and of whom some followed his camp <lb/>
            most unwillingly, and some remained at home to his great <lb/>
            disgust. But to Cæsar the neutrality of Atticus was so <lb/>
            pleasing, that when he became conqueror, and desired money <lb/>
            from several private persons by letter, he not only forebore to <lb/>
            trouble Atticus, but even released, at his request, his sister's <lb/>
            son and Quintus Cicero from Pompey's camp. Thus, by <lb/>
            adhering to his old course of life, he avoided new dangers.</p>
          <p>VIII. Then followed the time,t when, on the assassination <lb/>
            of Cæsar, the commonwealth seemed to be in the hands of the <lb/>
            Bruti ‡ and Cassius, and the whole state turned towards them. <lb/>
            Atticus, at that period, conducted himself towards Brutus in <lb/>
            such a way, that that young man was not in more familiar <lb/>
            intercourse with any one of his own age, than with him who <lb/>
            was so advanced in years, and not only paid him the highest <lb/>
            honour at the council, but also at his table. It was projected <lb/>
            by some that a private fund should be formed by the Roman <lb/>
            knights for the assassins of Cæsar; a scheme which they <lb/>
            thought might easily be accomplished if even only the leading <lb/>
            men of that order would furnish contributions. Atticus was <lb/>
            accordingly solicited by Caius Flavius, an intimate friend of <lb/>
            Brutus, to consent to become a promoter of the plan. But <note type="footnote"> * Ejus observantia.] Observantia, as Bos and Fischer observe, is <lb/>

            chapter is extremely bald. Whether tempus, which Bos understands <lb/>

            purposely omitted it, must remain doubtful. Perhaps more words <lb/>
            than one are lost. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Penes Brutos.] Some editions have Brutum. I prefer the plural, <lb/>

            Atticus, who thought that services were to be done to friends <lb/>
            without regard to party, and had always kept himself aloof <lb/>
            from such schemes, replied that, " If Brutus wished to make <lb/>
            use of any of his property, he might avail himself of it as far <lb/>
            as it would allow; but that about that project he would never <lb/>
            confer or join with any man." Thus that combination of a party <lb/>
            was broken by his dissent alone. Not long after, Antony <lb/>
            began to get the advantage; so that Brutus and Cassius, <lb/>
            despairing of their fortune, went into exile, into the provinces <lb/>
            which had been given them for form's sake by the consuls. <lb/>
            Atticus, who had refused to contribute with others to that <lb/>
            party when it was prosperous, sent to Brutus, when he was <lb/>
            east down and retiring from Italy, a hundred sestertia † as a <lb/>
            present; and, when he was parted from him, he ordered three <lb/>
            hundred ‡ to be sent to him in Epirus. Thus he neither paid <lb/>
            greater court to Antony when in power, nor deserted those <lb/>
            that were in desperate circumstances.</p>

            less of him than I ought; for he rather proved himself divine, if <lb/>
            a constant goodness of nature, which is neither increased nor <lb/>
            diminished by the events of fortune, may be called divinity.|| <lb/>
            Antony, being declared an enemy, bad quitted Italy, nor was <note type="footnote"> * Dicis—causâ.] Boa's text, and many others, with all the manu­ <lb/>

            Necis is defended by Savaro, who says that the provinces were given <lb/>
            to Brutus and Cassius for killing Caesar. Gebhard supports Savaro, <lb/>

            But, as Ernstius observes, the provinces could not have beau given to <lb/>
            Brutus and Cassius particularly for killing Cæsar, for they were not <lb/>
            the only ones concerned in his death; and he therefore prefers dicis <lb/>

            Cicero, and was very warmly attached to Brutus, yet would not <lb/>
            only never give them his consent to act against Antony, but, <lb/>
            on the contrary, protected, as much as he could, such of his <lb/>
            friends as fled from the city, and supplied them with whatever <lb/>
            they wanted. On Publius Volumnius, indeed, he conferred <lb/>
            such obligations, that more could not have proceeded from a <lb/>
            father. To Fulvia herself, too, when she was distracted with law­ <lb/>

            such constancy, that she never appeared to answer to bail t with <lb/>

            and even when she had bought an estate, in her prosperous <lb/>
            circumstances, to be paid for by a certain day, and was unable <lb/>
            after her reverse of fortune to borrow money to discharge the <lb/>
            debt,‡ he came to her aid, and lent her the money without <lb/>
            interest, and without requiring any security for the repayment, <lb/>

            and to show, at the same time, that it was his practice to be a <lb/>
            friend, not to fortune but to men; and when he acted in such <lb/>
            a manner, no one could imagine that he acted for the sake of <lb/>
            time-serving, for it entered into nobody's thoughts that Antony <lb/>
            could regain his authority. But he gradually incurred blame <lb/>

            what others would commend. On a sudden fortune was <lb/>
            changed. When Antony returned into Italy, every one thought <lb/>
            that Atticus would be in great peril, on account of his close <lb/>
            intercourse with Cicero and Brutus. He accordingly withdrew <lb/>
            from the forum on the approach of the leaders,* from dread of <lb/>
            the proscription, and lived in retirement at the house of Pub­ <lb/>
            lius Volumnius, to whom, as we have said, he had not long <lb/>
            before given assistance; (such were the vicissitudes of fortune <lb/>
            in those days, that sometimes one party, and sometimes the <lb/>
            other, was in the greatest exaltation or in the greatest peril;) <lb/>
            and he had with him Quintus Gellius Canus, a man of the <lb/>
            same age, and of a character very similar to his own; and this <lb/>
            also may be given as an instance of the goodness of Atticus's <lb/>
            disposition, that he lived in such close intimacy with him <lb/>
            whom he had known when a boy at school, that their friend­ <lb/>
            ship increased even to the end of their lives. But Antony, <lb/>
            though he was moved with such hatred towards Cicero, that he <lb/>
            showed his enmity, not only to him, but to all his friends, and <lb/>
            resolved to proscribe them, yet, at the instance of many, was <lb/>
            mindful of the obliging conduct of Atticus; and, after ascer-' <lb/>
            taining where he was, wrote to him with his own hand, that <lb/>
            he need be under no apprehension, but might come to him imme­ <lb/>
            diately ; as he had excepted him and Gellius Canus, for his <lb/>
            sake, from the number of the proscribed; and that he might <lb/>
            not fall into any danger, as the message was sent at night, he <lb/>
            appointed him a guard. Thus Atticus, in a time of the greatest <lb/>
            alarm, was able to save, not only himself, but him whom he <lb/>
            held most dear ; for he did not seek aid from any one for the <lb/>
            sake of his own security only, but in conjunction with his <lb/>
            friend; so that it might appear that he wished to endure no <lb/>
            kind of fortune apart from him. But if a pilot is extolled <lb/>
            with the greatest praise, who saves a ship from a tempest in <lb/>
            the midst of a rocky sea, why should not his prudence be <lb/>
            thought of the highest character, who arrives at safety through <lb/>
            so many and so violent civil tumults?</p>

             <pb n="439"/>
            by whatever means he could. When the common people, in <lb/>
            consequence of the rewards offered by the triumvirs, were <lb/>
            searching for the proscribed, no one went into Epirus* with­ <lb/>
            out finding a supply of everything; and to every one was <lb/>
            given permission to reside there constantly. After the battle <lb/>
            of Philippi, too, and the death of Caius Cassius and Marcus <lb/>
            Brutus, he resolved on protecting Lucius Julius Mocilla, a <lb/>
            man of praetorian rank, and his son, as well as Aulus Tor­ <lb/>
            quatus, and others involved in the same ill fortune, and <lb/>
            caused supplies of everything to be sent them from Epirus to <lb/>
            Samothrace.</p>
          <p>To enumerate all such acts of his would be difficult; nor <lb/>
            are they necessary to be particularized. One point we would <lb/>
            wish to be understood, that his generosity was not time- <lb/>
            serving or artful, as may be judged from the circumstances <lb/>
            and period in which it was shown; for he did not make his <lb/>
            court to the prosperous, but was always ready to succour the <lb/>
            distressed. Servilia, for instance, the mother of Brutus, he <lb/>
            treated with no less consideration after Brutus's death than <lb/>
            when she was in the height of good fortune. Indulging his <lb/>
            liberality in such a manner, he incurred no enmities, since he <lb/>
            neither injured any one, nor was he, if he received any injury, <lb/>
            more willing to resent than to forget it. Kindnesses that he <lb/>
            received he kept in perpetual remembrance; but such as he <lb/>
            himself conferred, he remembered only so long as he who had <lb/>
            received them was grateful. He accordingly made it appear <lb/>
            to have been truly said, that “ Every man's manners make <lb/>
            his fortune." Yet he did not study his fortunet before he <lb/>
            formed himself, taking care that he might not justly suffer for <lb/>
            any part of his conduct.</p>
          <p>XII. By such conduct, therefore, he brought it to pass, <lb/>
            that Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, who was united in the closest <lb/>
            intimacy with young Cæsar, though, through his own interest <lb/>
            and Cæsar's influence, he had power to choose a wife from <lb/>
            any rank whatever, fixed on a connexion with him rather than <note type="footnote"> * Where Atticus had estates. See c. 14. </note><note type="footnote"> + Neque tamen priùsille fortunam, quàm sc ipse, finxit.] A very <lb/>

            with any other, and preferred a marriage with the daughter of <lb/>
            a Roman knight to an alliance with the most noble of women. <lb/>
            The promoter of this match (for it is not to be concealed) was <lb/>
            Mark Antony, when triumvir for settling the state; but <lb/>
            though Atticus might have increased his property by the <lb/>
            interest of Antony, he was so far from coveting money, that <lb/>
            he never made use of that interest except to save his friends <lb/>
            from danger or trouble ;* a fact which was eminently remark­ <lb/>
            able at the time of the proscription; for when the triumviri, <lb/>
            according to the way in which things were then managed, had <lb/>
            sold the property of Lucius Saufeius, a Roman knight, who <lb/>
            was of the same age as Atticus, and who, induced by a love <lb/>
            for the study of philosophy, had lived with him several years <lb/>
            at Athens, and had valuable estates in Italy, it was effected <lb/>
            by the efforts and perseverance of Atticus, that Saufeius was <lb/>
            made acquainted by the same messenger, that “ he had lost <lb/>
            his property and had recovered it." He also brought off <lb/>
            Lucius Julius Calidus, whom I think I may truly assert to <lb/>
            have been the most elegant poet that our age has produced <lb/>
            since the death of Lucretius and Catullus, as well as a man of <lb/>
            high character, and distinguished by the best intellectual ac­ <lb/>
            complishments, who, in his absence, after the proscription of <lb/>
            the knights, had been enrolled in the number of the proscribed <lb/>
            by Publius Volumnius, the captain of Antonyms engineers, on <lb/>
            account of his great possessions in Africa; an act on the part <lb/>
            of Atticus, of which it was hard to judge at the time, whether <lb/>
            it were more onerous or honourable. But it was well known <lb/>
            that the friends of Atticus, in times of danger, were not less <lb/>
            his care in their absence than when they were present.</p>
          <p>XIII. Nor was he considered less deserving as a master <lb/>
            of a family than as a member of the state; for though he was <lb/>
            very rich, no man was less addicted to buying or building <lb/>
            than he. Yet he lived in very good style, and had everything <lb/>
            of the best; for he occupied the house that had belonged to <lb/>
            Tamphilust on the Quirinal hill, which was bequeathed to him <lb/>
            by his uncle, and the attractions of which consisted, not in <note type="footnote"> * Nisi in deprecandis amicorum aut periculis aut incommodis.] <lb/>

            the building itself, but in the wood by which it was sur <lb/>
            rounded; for the edifice, constructed after the ancient fashion, <lb/>
            showed more regard to convenience* than expense, and At­ <lb/>
            ticus made no alteration in it except such as he was obliged to <lb/>
            make by the effects of time. He kept an establishment of <lb/>
            slaves of the best kind, if we were to judge of it by its utility, <lb/>
            but if by its external show, scarcely coming up to mediocrity; <lb/>
            for there were in it well-taught youths, excellent readers, and <lb/>
            numerous transcribers of books, insomuch that there was not <lb/>
            even a footmanf that could not act in either of those capacities <lb/>
            extremely well. Other kinds of artificers,‡ also, such as do­ <lb/>
            mestic necessities require, were very good there, yet he had <lb/>
            no one among them that was not born and instructed in his <lb/>
            house; all which particulars are proofs, not only of his self­ <lb/>
            restraint, but of his attention to his affairs; for not to desire <lb/>
            inordinately what he sees desired by many, gives proof of a <lb/>
            man's moderation; and to procure what he requires by labour <lb/>
            rather than by purchase, manifests no small exertion. Atticus <lb/>
            was elegant, not magnificent; polished, not extravagant; he <lb/>
            studied, with all possible care, neatness, and not profusion. <lb/>
            His household furniture was moderate, not superabundant, <lb/>
            but so that it could not be considered as remarkable in either <lb/>
            respect. Nor will I omit the following particular, though I <lb/>
            may suppose that it will be unimportant to some: that though <lb/>
            he was a hospitable Roman knight, and invited, with no want <lb/>
            of liberality, men of all ranks to his house, we know that he <lb/>
            was accustomed to reckon from his day-book, as laid out in <lb/>
            current expenses, not more than three thousand asses § a <note type="footnote"> * Plus salis.] The word salis does not admit of a very satisfactory <lb/>

            month, one month with another; and we relate this, not as <lb/>
            hearsay but as what we know, for we were often present, by <lb/>
            reason of the intimacy between us, at his domestic arrange­ <lb/>
            ments.</p>
          <p>XIV. At his banquets no one ever heard any other enter­ <lb/>
            tainment for the ears. than a reader; an entertainment <lb/>
            which we, for our parts, think in the highest degree pleasing; <lb/>
            nor was there ever a supper at his house without reading of <lb/>
            some kind, that the guests might find their intellect gratified <lb/>
            no less than their appetite, for he used to invite people whose <lb/>
            tastes were not at variance with his own. After a large <lb/>
            addition, too, was made to his property, he made no change in <lb/>
            his daily arrangements, or usual way of life, and exhibited such <lb/>
            moderation, that he neither lived unhandsomely, with a for­ <lb/>
            tune of two thousand sestertia,t which he had inherited from <lb/>
            his father, nor did he, when he had a fortune of a hundrec <lb/>
            thousand sestertia,‡ adopt a more splendid mode of living that <lb/>
            that with which he had commenced, but kept himself at an <lb/>
            equal elevation in both states. He had no gardens, no expen­ <lb/>
            sive suburban or maritime villa, nor any farm except those at <lb/>
            Ardea and Nomentum; and his whole revenue arose from his <lb/>
            property in Epirus and at Rome. Hence it may be seen that <lb/>
            he was accustomed to estimate the worth of money, not by the <lb/>
            quantity of it, but by the mode in which it was used.</p>
          <p>XV. He would neither utter a falsehood himself, nor <lb/>
            could he endure it in others. His courtesies, accordingly, <lb/>
            were paid with a strict regard to veracity, just as his gravity <lb/>
            was mingled with affability; so that it is hard to determine <lb/>
            whether his friends' reverence or love for him were the greater. <lb/>
            Whatever he was asked to do, he did not promise without <lb/>
            solemnity,§ for he thought it the part, not of a liberal, but of <lb/>
            a light-minded man, to promise what he would be unable to <lb/>
            perform. But in striving to effect what he had once engaged <lb/>
            to do, he used to take so much pains, that he seemed to be <note type="footnote"> 0 Aliud acroama.] Acroama, as Fischer observes, generally signified <lb/>

             <pb n="443"/>
            engaged, not in an affair entrusted to him, but in his own. <lb/>
            Of a matter which he had once taken in hand, he was never <lb/>
            weary; for he thought his reputation, than which he held <lb/>
            nothing more dear, concerned in the accomplishment of it. <lb/>
            Hence it happened that he managed all the commissions. of <lb/>
            the Ciceros, Cato, Marius, Quintus Hortensius, Aulus Tor­ <lb/>
            quatus, and of many Roman knights besides. It may therefore <lb/>
            be thought certain that he declined business of state, not from <lb/>
            indolence, but from judgment.</p>
          <p>XVI. Of his kindness of disposition, I can give no greater <lb/>
            proof than that, when he was young, he was greatly liked by <lb/>
            Sylla, who was then old, and when he was old, he was much <lb/>
            beloved by Marcus Brutus, then but young; and that with those <lb/>
            friends of the same age as himself, Quintus Hortensius and <lb/>
            Marcus Cicero, he lived in such a manner that it is hard to <lb/>
            determine to which age his disposition was best adapted, <lb/>
            though Marcus Cicero loved him above all men, so that not <lb/>
            even his brother Quintus was dearer or more closely united to <lb/>
            him. In testimony of this fact (besides the books in which <lb/>
            Cicero mentions him, and which have been published to the <lb/>
            world), there are sixteen books of letters, written to Atticus, <lb/>
            which extend from his consulship to his latter days, and which <lb/>
            he that reads will not much require a regular history of those <lb/>
            times; for all particulars concerning the inclinations of leading <lb/>
            men, the faults of the generals, and the revolutions in the <lb/>
            government, are so fully stated in them that every thing is made <lb/>
            clear; and it may be easily concluded that wisdom is in some <lb/>
            degree divination, as Cicero not only predicted that those <lb/>
            things would happen which took place during his life, but <lb/>
            foretold, like a prophet, the things which are coming to pass <lb/>
            at present.</p>
          <p>XVII. Of the affectionate disposition of Atticus towards his <lb/>
            relatives, why should I say much, since I myself heard him <lb/>
            proudly assert, and with truth, at the funeral of his mother, <lb/>
            whom he buried at the age of ninety, that“he had never had oc­ <lb/>
            casion to be reconciled to his mother,”† and that " he had never <lb/>
            been at all at variance with his sister," who was nearly of the <note type="footnote"> * Omnia negotia.] This must be taken with much limitation; he <lb/>
            might do all the business with which they troubled him. </note><note type="footnote"> t Nunquam cum matre in gratiam rediisse.] Never having had any <lb/>
            disagreement with her </note> <lb/>

            same age with himself; a proof that either no cause of com­ <lb/>
            plaint had happened between them, or that he was a person of <lb/>
            such kind feelings towards his relatives, as to think it an im­ <lb/>
            piety to be offended with those whom he ought to love. Nor <lb/>
            did he act thus from nature alone, though we all obey her, but <lb/>
            from knowledge ; for he had fixed in his mind the precepts of <lb/>
            the greatest philosophers, so as to use them for the direction <lb/>
            of his life, and not merely for ostentation.</p>
          <p>XVIII. He was also a strict imitator of the customs of our <lb/>
            ancestors, and a lover of antiquity, of which he had so exact a <lb/>
            knowledge, that he has illustrated it throughout in the book in <lb/>
            which he has characterized. the Roman magistrates; for there <lb/>
            is no law, or peace, or war, or illustrious action of the Roman <lb/>
            people, which is not recorded in it at its proper period, and, <lb/>
            what was extremely difficult, he has so interwoven in it the <lb/>
            origin of families, that we may ascertain from it the pedigrees <lb/>
            of eminent men. He has given similar accounts too, sepa­ <lb/>
            rately, in other books; as, at the request of Marcus Brutus, <lb/>
            he specified in order the members of the Junian family, from <lb/>
            its origin to the present age, stating who each was, from whom <lb/>
            sprung, what offices he held, and at what time. In like manner, <lb/>
            at the request of Marcellus Claudius, he gave an account of <lb/>
            the family of the Marcelli; at the request of Scipio Cornelius <lb/>
            and Fabius Maximus, of that of the Fabii and Æmilii; than <lb/>
            which books nothing can be more agreeable to those who have <lb/>
            any desire for a knowledge of the actions of illustrious men.</p>
          <p>He attempted also poetry, in order, we suppose, that he <lb/>
            might not be without experience of the pleasure of writing it; <lb/>
            for he has characterized in verse such men as excelled the rest <lb/>
            of the Roman people in honour and the greatness of their <lb/>
            achievements, so that he has narrated, under each of their effi­ <lb/>
            gies, their actions and offices, in not more than four or five <lb/>
            lines; and it is almost inconceivable that such important mat­ <lb/>
            ters could have been told in so small a space. There is also a <lb/>
            book of his, written in Greek, on the consulship of Cicero.</p>
          <p>These particulars, so for, were published by me whilst <lb/>
            Atticus was alive. <note type="footnote"> * Ornavit.] Bos, Vossius, and others, prefer ordinavit. But Heu­ <lb/>

          <p>XIX. Since fortune has chosen that we should outlive him, <lb/>
            we will now proceed with the sequel, and will show our readers <lb/>
            by example, as far as we can, that (as we have intimated <lb/>
            above) “ it is in general a man's manners that bring him his <lb/>
            fortune."* For Atticus, though content in the equestrian <lb/>
            rank in which he was born, became united by marriage with <lb/>
            the emperor Julius's son, whose friendship he had previously <lb/>
            obtained by nothing else but his elegant mode of living, by <lb/>
            which he had charmed also other eminent men in the state, of <lb/>
            equal birth,! but of lower fortune ; for such prosperity attended <lb/>
            Cæsar, that fortune gave him everything that she had previously <lb/>
            bestowed upon any one, and secured for him what no citizen <lb/>
            of Rome had ever been able to attain. Atticus had a grand. <lb/>
            daughter, the daughter of Agrippa, to whom he had married <lb/>
            his daughter in her maidenhood; and Cæs ir betrothed her, <lb/>
            when she was scarcely a year old, to Tiberius Claudius Nero, <lb/>
            son of Drusilla, and step-son to himself; an alliance which <lb/>
            established their friendship, and rendered their intercourse <lb/>
            more frequent.</p>
          <p>XX. Even before this connexion, however, Cæsar not only, <lb/>
            when he was absent from the city, never despatched letters to any <lb/>
            one of his friends without writing to Atticus what he was <lb/>
            doing, what, above all, he was reading, in what place he was, <lb/>
            and how long he was going to stay in it, but even when he was <lb/>
            in Rome, and through his numberless occupations enjoyed the <lb/>
            society of Atticus less frequently than he wished, scarcely any <lb/>
            day passed in which he did not write to him, sometimes ask­ <lb/>
            ing him something relating to antiquity, sometimes proposing <lb/>
            to him some poetical question, and sometimes, by a jest, <lb/>
            drawing from him a longer letter than ordinary. Hence it <lb/>
            was, that when the temple of Jupiter Feretrius, built in the <lb/>
            Capitol by Romulus, was unroofed and falling down through <lb/>
            age and neglect, Cæsar, on the suggestion of Atticus, took <lb/>
            care that it should be repaired.</p>
          <p>Nor was he less frequently, when absent, addressed in let­ <lb/>
            ters by Mark Antony; so that, from the remotest parts of <lb/>
            the earth, he gave Atticus precise information what he was <lb/>
            doing, and what cares he had upon him. How strong such <note type="footnote"> * Conciliare fortunam.] " Procure him his fortune," make his <lb/>

             <pb n="446"/>
            attachment is, he will be easily able to judge, who can under­ <lb/>
            stand how much prudence is required to preserve the friendship <lb/>
            and favour of those between whom there existed not only <lb/>
            emulation in the highest matters, but such a mutual struggle <lb/>
            to lessen one another as was sure to happen between Cæsar and <lb/>
            Antony, when each of them desired to be chief, not merely of <lb/>
            the city of Rome, but of the whole world.</p>
          <p>XXI. After he had completed, in such a course of life, <lb/>
            seventy-seven years, and had advanced, not less in dignity, than <lb/>
            in favour and fortune (for he obtained many legacies on no other <lb/>
            account thin his goodness of disposition), and had also been <lb/>
            in the enjoyment of so happy a state of health, that he had <lb/>
            wanted no medicine for thirty years, he contracted a disorder <lb/>
            of which at first both himself and the physicians thought <lb/>
            lightly, for they supposed it to be a tenesmus, and speedy <lb/>
            and easy remedies were proposed for it; but after he had passed <lb/>
            three months under it without any pain, except what he <lb/>
            suffered from the means adopted for his cure, such force of the <lb/>
            disease fell into the one intestine,. that at last a putrid ulcer <lb/>
            broke out through his loins. Before this took place, and <lb/>
            when he found that the pain was daily increasing, and that <lb/>
            fever was superadded, he caused his son-in-law Agrippa to be <lb/>
            called to him, and with him Lucius Cornelius Balbus and <lb/>
            Sextus Peducæus. When he saw that they were come, he <lb/>
            said, as he supported himself on his elbow, 11 How much care <lb/>
            and diligence I have employed to restore my health on this <lb/>
            occasion, there is no necessity for me to state at large, since I <lb/>
            have yourselves as witneses ; and since I have, as I hope, satis­ <lb/>
            fied you, that I have left nothing undone that seemed likely to <lb/>
            cure me, it remains that I consult for myself. Of this feeling <lb/>
            on my part I had no wish that you should be ignorant; for I <lb/>
            have determined on ceasing to feed the disease ; as, by the food <lb/>
            and drink that I have taken during the last few days, I have <lb/>
            prolonged life only so as to increase my pains without hope of <lb/>
            recovery. I therefore entreat you, in the first place, to give your <lb/>
            approbation to my resolution, and in the next, not to labour in <lb/>
            vain by endeavouring to dissuade me from executing it." <note type="footnote"> * In unum intestinum.] Barthius wished to alter it to imum intesti­ <lb/>

          <p>XXII. Having delivered this address with so much steadi­ <lb/>
            ness of voice and countenance, that he seemed to be removing, <lb/>
            not out of life, but out of one house into another,-when <lb/>
            Agrippa, weeping over him and kissing him, entreated and con­ <lb/>
            jured him “ not to accelerate that which nature herself would <lb/>
            bring, and, since he might live some time longer,. to preserve <lb/>
            his life for himself and his friends,”—he put a stop to his <lb/>
            prayers, by an obstinate silence. After he had accordingly ab­ <lb/>
            stained from food for two days, the fever suddenly left him, <lb/>
            and the disease began to be less oppressive. He persisted, <lb/>
            nevertheless, in executing his purpose; and in consequence, <lb/>
            on the fifth day after he had fixed his resolution, and on the <lb/>
            last day of February, in the consulship of Cnæus Dominius <lb/>
            and Caius Sosius, he died.† His body was carried out of his <lb/>
            house on a small couch, as he himself had directed, without <lb/>
            any funereal pomp, all the respectable portion of the people at­ <lb/>
            tending,‡ and a vast crowd of the populace. He was buried <lb/>

          <p>ACCORDING to the pleasure of your Clemency.† I have <lb/>
            arranged in a brief narrative, in the order of time, such par­ <lb/>
            ticulars in the history of Rome as seemed most worthy of <lb/>
            notice, in transactions either of war or peace, from the <lb/>
            foundation of the city to our own days; adding concisely, <lb/>
            also, such matters as were remarkable in the lives of the <lb/>
            emperors ; that your Serenity's divine mind may rejoice to <lb/>
            learn that it has followed the actions of illustrious men in <lb/>
            governing the empire, before it became acquainted with them <lb/>
            by reading.‡ <note type="footnote"> * The title stands thus: DOMINO VALENTI MAXIMO PERPETUO <lb/>
            AUGUSTO. On the last two words Tzschucke has this note : " For <lb/>
            Perpetuo Augusto Sextus Rufus" (who wrote a Breviarum de Victories et <lb/>
            Provinciis Populi Romani, dedicated to Valens), “has in his dedication <lb/>
            Semper Augusto. The Germans would say Allzeit Meltrer des Reichs. <lb/>
            See Pütman De Titulo Semper Augustus, p. 60.” Tzschucke, apparently, <lb/>
            took perpetuo as an adverb, equivalent to temper. But Cellarius and <lb/>
            others consider it as an adjective. Cellarius cites, in comparison with <lb/>
            it, from Gruter. Inscript. p. 285, n. 8, D. N. Valentiniano Perpetuo ac <lb/>
            FeUci Semper Augusto, and p 279, n. 4, ,Eterno Imperatori Nostro <lb/>

            that Theodosius is called perennis princeps in Reines. Class. Inscr. iii. <lb/>
            62. I have accordingly given Perpetuo as an adjective. Sextus <lb/>
            Rufus's dedication, too, as edited by Cellarius, Verheyk, and others, <lb/>

          <p>I. THE Roman empire, than which the memory of man can <lb/>
            recal scarcely any one smaller in its commencement, or greater in <lb/>
            its progress throughout the world, had its origin from Romulus; <lb/>
            who, being the son of a vestal virgin, and, as was supposed, of <lb/>
            Mars, was brought forth at one birth with his brother Remus. <lb/>
            While leading a predatory life among the shepherds, he <lb/>
            founded, when he was eighteen years of age, a small city on the <lb/>
            Palatine Hill, on the 21st day of April, in the third year of <lb/>
            the sixth Olympiad, and the three hundred and ninety-fourth <lb/>
            after the destruction of Troy.. <note type="footnote"> suredly have shown him better, than by addressing him thus, to be <lb/>
            such as he is described by Ammianus Marcellinus, lib. xxix., sub­ <lb/>
            rusticus homo, and xxxi. 41, Subagrestis ingenii, me liberalibus studiis <lb/>
            eruditus.— Vinetus. Some have doubted the genuineness of this dedi­ <lb/>
            cation to Valens, because the Greek translator has not included it in his <lb/>
            version; but the authority of manuscripts, and the resemblance of its <lb/>
            style to that of Eutropius, have induced Cellarius, Verheyk, Tzschucke, <lb/>
            and most other commentators, to believe it genuine. </note><note type="footnote"> * The words ut, qui plurimum minimumque, tradunt, which occur in <lb/>
            till editions before the date, are not translated ; for nothing satisfactory <lb/>
            has yet been said as to their grammatical construction. Madame <lb/>
            Dacier suggested that we should supply ut eos præteream qui. But <lb/>
            præteream is not to the purpose. Hausius's explanation is ut ego inter <lb/>
            eos tradam qui plurimum minimumque tradunt. The Berlin edition of <lb/>
            1791 interprets better : ut medium inter eos qui—tradunt, ego tradam. <lb/>
            There is no doubt that Eutropius meant that he would take a middle <lb/>
            point between those who give the highest and those who give the <lb/>
            lowest date ; but the words to be supplied for the construction seem <lb/>
            not to have been yet discovered. Perhaps the sense is “ as those say <lb/>
            who give the highest and lowest dates, and take a middle point between <lb/>
            them,” something equivalent to the words in italics being intended to <lb/>
            be understood. The same words occur in b. x. c. 18, with the con­ <lb/>
            struction equally uncertain. </note></p><pb n="453"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="C VI.]"/> II. After founding the city, which he called Rome, from his <lb/>
            own name, he proceeded principally as follows. He took a <lb/>
            great number of the neighbouring inhabitants into the city; he <lb/>
            chose a hundred of the older men, by whose advice he might <lb/>
            manage all his affairs, and whom, from their age, he named <lb/>
            senators. Next, as both himself and his people were in want <lb/>
            of wives, he invited the tribes contiguous to the city to an <lb/>
            exhibition of games, and seized upon their young women. <lb/>
            Wars having arisen in consequence of this outrage in cap <lb/>
            turing the females, he conquered the Cæninenses, the Antem <lb/>
            nates, the Crustumini, the Sabines, the Fidenates, and the <lb/>
            Vejentes; all whose towns lay around the city. And since, <lb/>
            after a tempest that suddenly arose, in the thirty-seventh year <lb/>
            of his reign, he was no longer to be seen, he was believed to <lb/>
            have been translated to the gods, and was accordingly deified. <lb/>
            The senators then ruled at Rome by periods of five days; and <lb/>
            under their government a year was passed</p>
          <p>III. Afterwards Numa Pompilius was elected king, who <lb/>
            engaged indeed in no wars, but was of no less service to the <lb/>
            state than Romulus; for he established both laws and customs <lb/>
            among the Romans, who, by the frequency of their wars, were <lb/>
            now regarded as robbers and semi-barbarians. He divided the <lb/>
            year, before unregulated by any computation, into ten months, <lb/>
            and founded numerous sacred rites and temples at Rome. He <lb/>
            died a natural death in the forty-third year of his reign.</p>
          <p>IV. To him succeeded Tullus Hostilius, who re-commenced <lb/>
            war. He conquered the Albans, who lay twelve miles distant <lb/>
            from Rome. He overcame also in battle the Vejentes and <lb/>
            Fidenates, the one six, the other eighteen miles from Rome; <lb/>
            and increased the dimensions of the city by the addition of <lb/>
            the Ccelian hill. After reigning thirty-two years, he was struck <lb/>
            by lightning, and consumed together with his house.</p>
          <p>V. After him, Ancus Martius, the grandson of Numa by a <lb/>
            daughter, succeeded to the government. He fought against <lb/>
            the Latins, added the Aventine and Janiculan hills to the city, <lb/>
            and founded Ostia, a city on the sea-coast, sixteen miles from <lb/>
            Rome. He died a natural death in the twenty-fourth year of <lb/>
            his reign.</p>
          <p>VI. Priscus Tarquinius was next invested with the govern­ <lb/>
            ment. He doubled the number of the senators, built a Circus <lb/>
            at Rome, and instituted the Roman games which continUa <pb n="454"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="B.I."/> <lb/>
            even to our time. He also conquered the Sabines, and alded <lb/>
            a considerable extent of territory, which he took from that <lb/>
            people, to the lands of Rome; he was also the first that entered <lb/>
            the city in triumph. He built the walls and sewers, and <lb/>
            commenced the Capitol. He was killed in the thirty-eighth <lb/>
            year of his reign, by the sons of Ancus, the king whom he had <lb/>
            succeeded.</p>
          <p>VII. After him Servius Tullius was placed on the throne, <lb/>
            the son of a woman of noble origin, but who was, neverthe­ <lb/>
            less, a captive and a slave. He also defeated the Sabines; <lb/>
            annexed three hills, the Quirinal, Viminal, and Esquiline, to <lb/>
            the city ; and formed trenches round the city walls. He was <lb/>
            the first to institute the census, which till that time was unknown <lb/>
            throughout the world. The people being all subjected to a <lb/>
            census during his reign, Rome was found to contain eighty-four <lb/>
            thousand citizens, including those in the country. He was <lb/>
            cut off in the forty-fifth year of his reign, by the criminal <lb/>
            machinations of his son-in-law Tarquin the Proud, the son of <lb/>
            the king to whom he had succeeded, and of his own daughter, <lb/>
            whom Tarquin had married.</p>
          <p>VIII. Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, the seventh and last of <lb/>
            the kings, overcame the Volsci, a nation not far from Rome, <lb/>
            on the road to Campania; reduced the towns of Gabii and <lb/>
            Suessa Pometia; made peace with the Tuscans ; and built a <lb/>
            temple to Jupiter in the Capitol. Afterwards, while he was <lb/>
            besieging Ardea, a town that lay about eighteen miles from the <lb/>
            city, he was deprived of his throne; for, as his younger son, <lb/>
            who was also named Tarquin, offered violence to Lucretia, the <lb/>
            wife of Collatinus, a most noble and chaste woman; and as <lb/>
            she, after complaining to her husband, her father, and her <lb/>
            friends, of the injury that she had suffered, slew herself in the <lb/>
            sight of them all; Brutus, in consequence, who was a <lb/>
            kinsman of Tarquinius, excited an insurrection among the <lb/>
            people, and deprived Tarquin of his regal authority. The <lb/>
            army, also, which was engaged with the king in besieging <note type="footnote">* Parens et ipse Tarquinii.] This passage perplexed the commen­ <lb/>
            tators, until it was discovered that parens was used by writers of the <lb/>
            lower ages for cognatus ; for which sense of the word Tzschucke refers <lb/>
            to Lampridius in Alex. c. 67, and to Casaubon on Capitolinus in <lb/>

            Ardea, soon after deserted him; and the king himself, on <lb/>
            going to the city, found the gates closed against him; and, <lb/>
            after having reigned five-and-twenty years, was forced to take <lb/>
            flight with his wife and children.</p>
          <p>Thus a regal form of government continued at Rome, under <lb/>
            seven kings, for the space of two hundred and forty-three <lb/>
            years, while as yet the dominion of the city, where its extent <lb/>
            was greatest, hardly reached fifteen miles.</p>
          <p>IX. Henceforth, instead of one king, two consuls were <lb/>
            chosen, with this view, that, if one should be disposed to act <lb/>
            unjustly, the other, having equal authority, might exercise a <lb/>
            control over him. It was determined also that they should <lb/>
            not hold their office longer than a year; in order that they <lb/>
            might not, by continued possession of power, grow too over­ <lb/>
            bearing; but, knowing that in a year they would return to <lb/>
            the level of private persons, might constantly conduct them­ <lb/>
            selves with moderation.</p>
          <p>In the first year, then, after the expulsion of the king and <lb/>
            his family, the consuls were Lucius Junius Brutus, who had <lb/>
            been the chief agent in the banishment of Tarquin, and Tar­ <lb/>
            quinius Collatinus, the husband of Lucretia. But that dignity <lb/>
            was soon taken from Tarquinius Collatinus; for it was enacted <lb/>
            that no one who bore the name of Tarquin should remain in <lb/>
            the city. Having collected, therefore, all his private property, <lb/>
            he removed from the city, and Valerius Publicola was made <lb/>
            consul in his stead. King Tarquin, however, after his expul­ <lb/>
            sion, stirred up war against Rome, and, having collected a <lb/>
            large force from all quarters, in order that he might be rein­ <lb/>
            stated on the throne, took the field.</p>
          <p>X. In the first encounter, Brutus and Aruns, Tarquin's son, <lb/>
            killed each other; but the Romans left the field conquerors. <lb/>
            The Roman matrons mourned for Brutus, the guardian of <lb/>
            their honour, as if he had been their common father, for the <lb/>
            space of a year. Valerius Publicola fixed upon Spurius <lb/>
            Lucretius Tricipitinus. the father of Lucretia, for his colleague; <lb/>
            and he dying of some disease, he next chose Horatius <lb/>
            Pulvillus for his fellow consul.</p>
          <p>Thus the first year had five consuls; Tarquinius Collatinus <lb/>
            having left the city on account of his name, Brutus having <lb/>
            fallen in battle, and Spurius Lucretius having died a natural <lb/>
            death.</p><pb n="456"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.I."/> XI. In the second year also, Tarquin, with a view to being <lb/>
            re-established on the throne, again made war on the Romans, <lb/>
            and, as Porsena, king of Tuscany, afforded him aid, almost <lb/>
            took Rome. But he was also defeated on that occasion.</p>
          <p>In the third year after the expulsion of the royal family, <lb/>
            Tarquin, as he could not get himself re-admitted into the king <lb/>
            dom, and as Porsena, who had made peace with the Romans, <lb/>
            gave him no support, retired to Tusculum, a town which is not <lb/>
            far from Rome; where he and his wife lived for fourteen years <lb/>
            in a private station, and reached an advanced age.</p>
          <p>In the fourth year after the abolition of the kingly power, <lb/>
            the Sabines, having made war on the Romans, were conquered; <lb/>
            and a triumph was celebrated over them.</p>
          <p>In the fifth year, Lucius Valerius, the colleague of Brutus, <lb/>
            and consul for the fourth time, died a natural death, and in <lb/>
            such extreme poverty, that the expenses of his funeral were <lb/>
            defrayed by a public subscription.* The matrons mourned for <lb/>
            him, as for Brutus, during a year.</p>
          <p>XII. In the ninth year after the overthrow of the kingly <lb/>
            power, the son-in-law of Tarquin, having assembled a vast <lb/>
            army, in order to avenge the wrongs of his father-in-law, a new <lb/>
            office was introduced at Rome, which was called the dictator­ <lb/>
            ship, and which was more absolute than the consulate. In the <lb/>
            same year also a master of the horse was appointed to be an <lb/>
            officer under the dictator. Nor can anything be named more <lb/>
            like to the imperial authority, which your Serenity t now <lb/>
            enjoys, than the ancient dictatorship, especially since Cæsar <lb/>
            Octavianus, also, of whom we shall speak hereafter, and Caius <lb/>
            Cæsar before him, ruled with the title and rank of dictator. <lb/>
            The first dictator at Rome was Lartius; the first master of <lb/>
            the horse, Spurius Cassius.</p>
          <p>XIII. In the sixteenth year after the termination of the <lb/>
            regal power, the people at Rome, thinking themselves oppressed <lb/>
            by the senate and consuls, broke out into a sedition. On this <lb/>
            occasion they created for themselves tribunes of the people, as <lb/>
            their own peculiar judges and defenders, by whom they might <lb/>

            tilities against the Romans ; and being overcome in the field, <lb/>
            lost also Corioli, the best city that they had.</p>
          <p>XV. In the eighteenth year after the banishment of the <lb/>
            royal family, Quintius Marcius, the Roman general who had <lb/>
            taken Corioli, the city of the Volsci, being compelled to flee <lb/>
            from Rome, directed his course, in resentment, to the Volsci <lb/>
            themselves, and received from them support against the <lb/>
            Romans. He obtained several victories over the Romans : he <lb/>
            made his way even to the fifth mile-stone from the city; and, <lb/>
            refusing to hear a deputation that came to sue for peace, would <lb/>
            have laid siege even to the place of his birth, had not his <lb/>
            mother Veturia and his wife Volumnia gone out from the city <lb/>
            to meet him, by whose tears and supplications he was pre­ <lb/>
            vailed on to withdraw his army. He was the next after <lb/>
            Tarquin that acted as general against his country.</p>
          <p>XVI. In the consulate of Cæso Fabius and Titus Vir­ <lb/>
            ginius, three hundred noblemen, members of the Fabian <lb/>
            family, undertook alone a war against the Vejentes, assuring <lb/>
            the senate and the people that the whole contest should <lb/>
            be brought to an end by themselves. These illustrious <lb/>
            men, therefore, each of whom was capable of commanding a <lb/>
            large army, setting out on their expedition, all fell in battle <lb/>
            One only remained out of so numerous a family, who, from his <lb/>
            extreme youth, could not be taken with them to the field. <lb/>
            After these events a census was held in the city, in which the <lb/>
            number of the citizens was found to be a hundred and nine­ <lb/>
            teen thousand three hundred and nineteen.</p>
          <p>XVII. In the following year, in consequence of the <lb/>
            blockade of a Roman army on Mount Algidus, about twelve <lb/>
            miles from the city, Lucius Quintius Cincinnatus was appointed <lb/>
            dictator; a man who, possessing only four acres of land, culti. <lb/>
            vated it with his own hands. He, being found at his work, <lb/>
            and engaged in ploughing, assumed, after wiping the sweat <lb/>
            from his brow, the toga prœtexta ; and set free the army with <lb/>
            great slaughter among the enemy.</p>
          <p>XVIII. In the three hundred and second * year from the <lb/>
            founding of the city, the consular government ceased; and, <lb/>
            instead of two consuls, ten magistrates were appointed to hold <lb/>
            the supreme authority, under the title of decemviri. These <lb/>
            during the first year conducted themselves with honour; but <note type="footnote"> * See note on iv. 10. </note> <pb n="458"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.L"/> <lb/>
            in the second, one of them, Appius Claudius, proceeded to <lb/>
            offer violence to the maiden daughter of a certain Virginius, <lb/>
            who was at that time filling an honourable post on military <lb/>
            service against the Latins on Mount Algidus; but the father <lb/>
            slew her with his own hand, that she might not suffer violation <lb/>
            from the decemvir, and, returning to the army, raised an <lb/>
            insurrection among the soldiers. Their power was in conse­ <lb/>
            quence taken from the decemviri, and they themselves received <lb/>
            sentences of condemnation.*</p>
          <p>XIX. In the three hundred and fifteenth year from the <lb/>
            founding of the city, the Fidenates rebelled against the <lb/>
            Romans. The Vejentes and their king Tolumnius gave them <lb/>
            assistance. These two states are so near to Rome, that <lb/>
            Fidenæ is only seven, Veii only eighteen miles distant. The <lb/>
            Volsci also joined them; but they were defeated by Marcus <lb/>
            Æmilius the dictator, and Lucius Quintius Cincinnatus the <lb/>
            master of the horse, and lost also their king. Fidenæ was <lb/>
            taken, and utterly destroyed.</p>
          <p>XX. Twenty years afterwards, the people of Veil resumed <lb/>
            hostilities. Furius Camillus was sent as dictator against <lb/>
            them, who first defeated them in battle, and then, after a long <lb/>
            siege, took their city, the oldest and richest in Italy. He next <lb/>
            took Falisci, a city of no less note. But popular odium was <lb/>
            excited against him, on the ground that he had made an <lb/>
            unfair division of the booty, and he was condemned on that <lb/>
            charge and banished.</p>
          <p>Soon after the Galli Senones marched towards Rome; and, <lb/>
            pursuing the Romans, whom they defeated at the river Allia, <lb/>
            eleven miles from the city, possessed themselves of the city <lb/>
            itself, no part of which could be defended against them, <lb/>
            except the Capitol. After they had besieged it a long time, and <lb/>
            the Romans were suffering from famine, Camillus, who was in <lb/>
            exile in a neighbouring city, attacked the Gauls unexpectedly, <lb/>
            and gave them a severe defeat. Afterwards,! on receiving a sum <note type="footnote"> * Damnati sunt.] Appius and Oppius, before the day for their trial <lb/>
            came, committed suicide. Their colleagues went into banishment <lb/>
            voluntarily, as appears from Livy. Claudius was sentenced to death, <lb/>
            but allowed to go into exile through the intercession of Virginius. <lb/>

            in gold, to desist from the siege of the Capitol, they <lb/>
            retreated; Camillus, however, pursued them, and routed them <lb/>
            with such a slaughter, that he recovered both the gold which <lb/>
            had been given to them, and all the military standards which <lb/>
            they had taken. Thus he entered the city for the third time <lb/>
            in triumph, and received the appellation of a second Romulus, <lb/>
            as if he also had been a founder of the city.</p>

          <p>I. IN the three hundred and sixty-fifth year after the foun­ <lb/>
            dation of the city, and the first after its capture by the Gauls, <lb/>
            the form of government was changed; and, instead of two <lb/>
            consuls, military tribunes, invested with consular power, were <lb/>
            created. From this time the power of Rome began to increase; <lb/>
            for that very year Camillus reduced the state of the Volsci, <lb/>
            which had persisted to make war for seventy years; also the <lb/>
            cities of the Æqui and Sutrini; and, overthrowing their armies, <lb/>
            took possession of them all; and thus enjoyed three triumphs <lb/>
            at the same time.</p>
          <p>II. Titus Quintius Cincinnatus, also, having pursued the <lb/>
            Prænestini, who had advanced in a hostile manner to the very <lb/>
            gates of Rome, defeated them on the river Allia, annexing <lb/>
            eight cities that were under their dominion to the Roman <lb/>
            empire; and, attacking Præneste itself, forced it to surrender; <lb/>
            all which acts were accomplished by him in the space of twenty <lb/>
            days ; and a triumph was decreed him.</p>
          <p>III. But the office of military tribunes did not last long; <lb/>
            for, after a short time, it was enacted that no more should be <lb/>
            created; and four years passed in the state in such a manner. <pb n="460"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B. II."/> <lb/>
            that none of the superior magistrates were appointed. The <lb/>
            military tribunes, however, were re-instated in their office with <lb/>
            consular authority, and continued for three years, when consuls <lb/>
            were again elected.</p>
          <p>IV. In the consulship of Lucius Genucius and Quintus <lb/>
            Servilius, Camillus died, and honour next to that of Romulus <lb/>
            was paid him.</p>
          <p>V. Titus Quintius was sent out as dictator against the <lb/>
            Gauls, who had marched into Italy; and had encamped about <lb/>
            four miles from the city, on the other side of the river Anio. <lb/>
            Titus Manlius, one of the noblest of the senators, encountering <lb/>
            a Gaul who had challenged him to single combat, slew him ; <lb/>
            and, having taken from his neck a chain of gold, and put it on <lb/>
            his own, secured the appellation of Torquatus to himself and <lb/>
            his posterity for ever. The Gauls were repulsed, and soon <lb/>
            afterwards entirely defeated by Caius Sulpicius the dictator. <lb/>
            Shortly after, the Tuscans were defeated by Caius Marcius, <lb/>
            and eight thousand of them were taken prisoners and led in <lb/>
            triumph.</p>
          <p>VI. A census was again taken ; and as the Latins, who <lb/>
            had been subdued by the Romans, refused to furnish troops, <lb/>
            recruits were levied from among the Romans only, and ten <lb/>
            legions were raised, making sixty thousand fighting men, or <lb/>
            upwards; so great was the power of the Romans in war, while <lb/>
            their territory was as yet but small. These troops having <lb/>
            marched out against the Gauls, under the conduct of Lucius <lb/>
            Furius Camillus, one of the Gauls challenged the most valiant <lb/>
            among the Romans to single combat; when Marcus Valerius, <lb/>
            a tribune of the soldiers, came forward to accept the challenge; <lb/>
            and, as he advanced in full armour, a crow settled upon his <lb/>
            right shoulder. Afterwards, too, when he commenced the <lb/>
            encounter with the Gaul, the same crow, with his wings and <lb/>
            talons, furiously assailed the Gaul's eyes, so that he was not <lb/>
            able to see before him, and thus, being slain by the tribune <lb/>
            Valerius, he gave him not only a victory, but a name; for he <lb/>
            was afterwards called Corvus. For the same service also, at <lb/>
            the age of three and twenty, he was made consul.</p>
          <p>VII. The Latins, who had refused to furnish troops, <lb/>
            proceeded also to demand of the Romans, that one of the <lb/>
            consuls should be elected from their own people, the other <lb/>
            from the Romans; this demand having been rejected, war was <pb n="461"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="C.X.]"/> <lb/>
            commenced against them, and they were overcome In a great <lb/>
            battle; and a triumph was celebrated on account of their <lb/>
            defeat. Statues were erected to the consuls in the Rostra, for <lb/>
            their service in gaining this victory.</p>
          <p>VIII. The Romans had now begun to be powerful; for a <lb/>
            war was carried on by them against the Samnites, who hold a <lb/>
            middle situation between Picenum, Campania, and Apulia, at <lb/>
            the distance of nearly a hundred and thirty miles from the <lb/>
            city. Lucius Papirius Cursor went to conduct that war with <lb/>
            the rank of dictator, and, on returning to Rome, gave orders <lb/>
            to Quintus Fabius Maximus, his master of the horse, whom <lb/>
            he left in charge of the army, not to fight during his absence. <lb/>
            He, however, seeing a favourable opportunity, commenced an <lb/>
            engagement with great success, and utterly defeated the Sam­ <lb/>
            nites ; he was accordingly condemned to death by the dictator, <lb/>
            for fighting contrary to his orders, but was saved by the power­ <lb/>
            ful interposition of the soldiers and people, so great a tumult <lb/>
            having been excited against Papirius, that he was almost <lb/>
            slain.</p>
          <p>IX. The Samnites subsequently, in the consulate of Titus <lb/>
            Veturius and Spurius Posthumius, defeated the Romans with <lb/>
            signal ignominy, and compelled them to pass under the yoke. <lb/>
            The peace, however, which had been concluded with them <lb/>
            through mere necessity, was broken by the senate and people. <lb/>
            After this the Samnites were defeated by Lucius Papirius the <lb/>
            consul, and seven thousand of them made to pass under the <lb/>
            yoke. Papirius was granted a triumph over the Samnites. <lb/>
            About the same time Appius Claudius the censor brought the <lb/>
            Claudian water into the city, and made the Appian way.</p>
          <p>The Samnites, renewing the war, defeated Quintus Fabius <lb/>
            Maximus, with the slaughter of three thousand of his troops; <lb/>
            but afterwards, his father, Fabius Maximus, being appointed <lb/>
            his lieutenant, he both defeated the Samnites, and took several <lb/>
            of their towns. Subsequently, Publius Cornelius Rufinus and <lb/>
            Manius Curius Dentatus, the two consuls, being sent against <lb/>
            the Samnites, reduced their strength in some considerable <lb/>
            battles. Thus they brought the war with the Samnites to an <lb/>
            end; a war which had lasted for forty-nine years, Nor was <lb/>
            there any enemy in Italy that put the valour of the Romans <lb/>
            more to the test.</p>
          <p>X. After an interval of a few years, the forces of the Gauls <pb n="462"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.II."/> <lb/>
            united with the Tuscans and Samnites against the Romans; <lb/>
            but, as they were marching to Rome, were cut off by the <lb/>
            consul Cnæus Cornelius Dolabella.</p>
          <p>XI. War was at the same time proclaimed against the <lb/>
            Tarentines (who are still a people at the extremity of Italy), <lb/>
            because they had offered violence to some Roman ambassadors. <lb/>
            These people asked aid against the Romans of Pyrrhus, <lb/>
            king of Epirus, who derived his origin from the family of <lb/>
            Achilles. He soon after passed over into Italy, and it was <lb/>
            then that the Romans fought for the first time with an enemy <lb/>
            from beyond sea. The consul Publius Valerius Lævinus was <lb/>
            sent against him; who, having seized some spies of Pyrrhus, <lb/>
            ordered them to be led through the camp, and the whole army <lb/>
            to be exhibited to them, and then to be dismissed, that they <lb/>
            might tell Pyrrhus whatever was going on among the Romans. <lb/>
            An engagement taking place soon after, Pyrrhus, when on the <lb/>
            point of fleeing, got the victory by means of his elephants, at <lb/>
            the sight of which the Romans, to whom they were strange, were <lb/>
            greatly terrified; but night put an end to the battle. Lævinus <lb/>
            however fled during the night. Pyrrhus took a thousand <lb/>
            eight hundred Romans prisoners, and treated them with the <lb/>
            greatest honour; the slain he buried. On observing those <lb/>
            lying dead, with their wounds in front, and with stern coun­ <lb/>
            tenances, he is said to have lifted up his hands to heaven, <lb/>
            exclaiming that “ he might himself have been master of the <lb/>
            whole world, if such soldiers had fallen to his lot."</p>
          <p>XII. Pyrrhus afterwards, having united to him the Sam­ <lb/>
            nites, the Lucanians, and the Bruttii, proceeded towards Rome. <lb/>
            He laid all waste with fire and sword, depopulated Campania, <lb/>
            and advanced to Preeneste, eighteen miles from Rome. Soon <lb/>
            after, through fear of an army which was pursuing him with a <lb/>
            consul at its head, he fell back upon Campania. Ambassadors, <lb/>
            who were sent to treat with Pyrrhus respecting the ransom of <lb/>
            the captives, were honourably entertained by him; and he <lb/>
            sent the captives back to Rome without payment. Fabricius, <lb/>
            one of the Roman ambassadors, he admired so much, that, <lb/>
            finding he was poor, he endeavoured to draw him over to his <lb/>
            side with the promise of a fourth part of his kingdom, but he <lb/>
            was repulsed with disdain by Fabricius. Pyrrhus, therefore, <lb/>
            being struck with admiration at the character of the Romans, <lb/>
            seut an eminent man. Cineas by name, as ambassador, to ask <pb n="463"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="C.XIV.]"/> <lb/>
            for peace on reasonable terms, provided that he might retain <lb/>
            possession of that part of Italy, of which he had already <lb/>
            become master in the war.</p>
          <p>XIII. Such terms of peace were not satisfactory, and an <lb/>
            answer was returned by the senate to Pyrrhus, that " he could <lb/>
            have no peace with the Romans, unless he retired from Italy." <lb/>
            The Romans then ordered that all the prisoners whom Pyrrhus <lb/>
            had sent back should be considered infamous,* because they <lb/>
            had suffered themselves to be taken with arms in their bands; <lb/>
            and not to be restored to their former rank, until they had <lb/>
            each produced the spoils of two slain enemies. Thus the <lb/>
            ambassador of Pyrrhus returned; and, when Pyrrhus asked <lb/>
            him " what kind of a place he had found Rome to be," Cineas <lb/>
            replied, that " he had seen a country of kings, for that all <lb/>
            there were such, as Pyrrhus alone was thought to be in Epirus <lb/>
            and the rest of Greece."</p>
          <p>The consuls Publius Sulpicius and Decius Mus were sent <lb/>
            out as generals against Pyrrhus. A battle being commenced, <lb/>
            Phrrhus was wounded, his elephants killed, twenty thousand of <lb/>
            the enemy slain, and of the Romans only five thousand. <lb/>
            Pyrrhus was forced to retire to Tarentum.</p>
          <p>XIV. After the lapse of a year, Fabricius was sent out <lb/>
            against Pyrrhus, the same who, when he was before among <lb/>
            the ambassadors, could not be won with a promise of <lb/>
            the fourth part of his kingdom. As Fabricius and the king <lb/>
            had their camps near to each other, the physician of Pyrrhus <lb/>
            came to Fabricius by night, offering to despatch Pyrrhus by <lb/>
            poison, if he would promise him some remuneration; upon <lb/>
            which Fabricius ordered that he should be taken back in <lb/>
            chains to his master, and that information should be given to <lb/>
            Pyrrhus of the proposals which the physician had made against <lb/>
            his life. The king, struck with admiration of his conduct, is <lb/>
            reported to have exclaimed on the occasion, “ That excellent <lb/>
            Fabricius is a man who can less easily be diverted from the <lb/>
            path of honour, than the sun from its course." Pyrrhus then <lb/>
            departed for Sicily. Fabricius, after defeating the Samnites <lb/>
            and Lucanians, obtained a triumph. <note type="footnote"> * Infames.] They all suffered some sort of degradation. Those who <lb/>
            had been in the cavalry were made to serve in the infantry, and those <lb/>
            who had been in the infantry were sent among the slingers. See Val. <lb/>

          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="[B. II."/> The consuls Manius Curius Dentatus and Cornelius Lentulus <lb/>
            were next sent against Pyrrhus; and Curius came to an engage­ <lb/>
            ment with him, cut off his army, drove him back to Tarentum. <lb/>
            and took his camp. On that day were slain twenty-three <lb/>
            thousand of the enemy. Curius Dentatus triumphed in his <lb/>
            consulate. He was the first that brought elephants to Rome, <lb/>
            in number, four. Pyrrhus also soon after quitted Tarentum, <lb/>
            and was killed at Argos, a city of Greece.</p>
          <p>XV. In the consulship of Caius Fabricius Licinus and <lb/>
            Caiu Claudius Canina, in the four hundred and sixty-first <lb/>
            year from the foundation of the city, ambassadors, from <lb/>
            Alexandria, despatched by Ptolemy, arrived at Rome, and <lb/>
            obtained from the Romans the friendship which they solicited.</p>
          <p>XVI. In the consulate of Quintus Ogulnius and Caius <lb/>
            Fabius Pictor, the Picenians commenced a war, and were con­ <lb/>
            quered by the succeeding consuls Publius Sempronius and <lb/>
            Appius Claudius, and a triumph was celebrated over them. <lb/>
            Two cities were founded by the Romans, Ariminum in Gaul, <lb/>
            and Beneventum in Samnium.</p>
          <p>XVII. When Marcus Attilius Regulus and Lucius Junius <lb/>
            Libo were consuls, war was declared against the Sallentines in <lb/>
            Apulia; and the Brundusians and their city were taken, <lb/>
            and a triumph granted on their subjugation.</p>
          <p>XVIII. In the four hundred and seventy-seventh year of <lb/>
            the city, although the Roman name had now become famous, <lb/>
            yet their arms had not been carried out of Italy. That it <lb/>
            might be ascertained, therefore, what the forces of the Romans <lb/>
            were, a census was taken. On this occasion the number of <lb/>
            citizens was found to be two hundred and ninety-two thousand, <lb/>
            three hundred and thirty-four, although from the founding of <lb/>
            the city wars had never ceased. It was then that the first war <lb/>
            was undertaken against the Africans, in the consulate of Appius <lb/>
            Claudius and Quintus Fulvius. A battle was fought with <lb/>
            them in Sicily; and Appius Claudius obtained a triumph for <lb/>
            a victory over the Africans and Hiero king of Sicily.</p>
          <p>XIX. In the year following, Valerius Marcus and Otacilius <lb/>
            being consuls, great deeds were achieved by the Romans in <lb/>
            Sicily. The Tauromenitani, Catanians, and fifty cities more, <lb/>
            were received into alliance. In the third year the war against <lb/>
            Hiero in Sicily was brought to an end. He, with all the Syra- <lb/>
            CUBan nobility, prevailed upon the Romans to grant them <pb n="465"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="C.XXI.]"/> <lb/>
            peace, paying down two hundred talents of silver. The Afri­ <lb/>
            cans were defeated in Sicily, and a triumph over them granted <lb/>
            at Rome a second time.</p>
          <p>XX. In the fifth year of the Punic war, which was carried <lb/>
            on against the Africans, the Romans first fought by sea, in the <lb/>
            consulate of Caius Duilius and Cnæus Cornelius Asina, <lb/>
            having provided themselves with vessels armed with beaks, <lb/>
            which they term Liburnian galleys. The consul Cornelius fell <lb/>
            a victim to treachery.- Duilius, joining battle, defeated the <lb/>
            commander of the Carthaginians, took thirty-one of their <lb/>
            ships, sunk fourteen, took seven thousand of the enemy <lb/>
            prisoners, and slew three thousand; nor was there ever a <lb/>
            victory more gratifying to the Romans, for they were now not <lb/>
            only invincible by land, but eminently powerful at sea.</p>
          <p>In the consulship of Caius Aquilius Floras and Lucius <lb/>
            Scipio, Scipio laid waste Corsica and Sardinia, carried away <lb/>
            several thousand captives from thence, and obtained a <lb/>
            triumph.</p>
          <p>XXI. When Lucius Manlius Vulso and Marcus Attilius <lb/>
            Regulus were consuls, war was carried over into Africa against <lb/>
            Hamilcar the general of the Carthaginians. A naval engage­ <lb/>
            ment was fought, and the Carthaginian utterly defeated, for <lb/>
            he retired with the loss of sixty four of his ships. The Romans <lb/>
            lost only twenty-two; and, having then crossed over into <lb/>
            Africa, they compelled Clypea, the first city at which they <lb/>
            arrived in Africa, to surrender. The consuls then advanced as <lb/>
            far as Carthage; and, having laid waste many places, Manlius <lb/>
            returned victorious to Rome, and brought with him twenty- <lb/>
            seven thousand prisoners. Attilius Regulus remained in <lb/>
            Africa. He drew up his army against the Africans; and, <lb/>
            fighting at the same time against three Carthaginian generals, <lb/>
            came off victorious, killed eighteen thousand of the enemy, <lb/>
            took five thousand prisoners, with eighteen elephants, and <lb/>
            received seventy-four cities into alliance. The vanquished <lb/>
            Carthaginians then sued to the Romans for peace, which <lb/>
            Regulus refusing to grant, except upon the hardest conditions, <lb/>
            the Africans sought aid from the Lacedæmonians, and, under a <lb/>
            leader named Xantippus, who had been sent them by the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians, Regulus, the Roman general, was overthrown <note type="footnote"> * He was deceived and made prisoner by one of Hannibal's officers. <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.IL"/> <lb/>
            with a desperate slaughter ; for two thousand men only escaped <lb/>
            of all the Roman army; five hundred, with their commander <lb/>
            Regulus, were taken prisoners, thirty thousand slain, and <lb/>
            Regulus himself thrown into prison.</p>
          <p>XXII. In the consulship of Marcus Æmilius Paulus and <lb/>
            Servius Fulvius Nobilior, both the Roman consuls set sail for <lb/>
            Africa, with a fleet of three hundred ships. They first over­ <lb/>
            came the Africans in a sea-fight; Æmilius the consul sunk a <lb/>
            hundred and four of the enemy's ships, took thirty, with the <lb/>
            soldiers in them, killed or took prisoners fifteen thousand of <lb/>
            the enemy, and enriched his own army with much plunder; <lb/>
            and Africa would then have been subdued, but that so great a <lb/>
            famine took place that the army could not continue there any <lb/>
            longer. The consuls, as they were returning with their victo. <lb/>
            rious fleet, suffered shipwreck on the coast of Sicily, and so <lb/>
            violent was the storm, that out of four hundred and sixty-four <lb/>
            ships, eighty could scarcely be saved; nor was so great a tem­ <lb/>
            pest at sea ever heard of at any period. The Romans, <lb/>
            notwithstanding, soon refitted two hundred ships, nor was their <lb/>
            spirit at all broken by their loss.</p>
          <p>XXIII. Cnæus Servilius Cæpio and Caius Sempronius <lb/>
            Rhesus, when consuls, set out for Africa with two hundred and <lb/>
            sixty ships, and took several cities. As they were returning <lb/>
            with a great booty, they suffered shipwreck; and, as these <lb/>
            successive calamities annoyed the Romans, the senate in <lb/>
            consequence decreed that wars by sea should be given up, <lb/>
            and that only sixty ships should be kept for the defence of <lb/>
            Italy.</p>
          <p>XXIV. In the consulship of Lucius Cæcilius Metellus and <lb/>
            Caius Furius Pacilus, Metellus defeated a general of the <lb/>
            Africans in Sicily, who came against him with a hundred and <lb/>
            thirty elephants and a numerous army, slew twenty thousand <lb/>
            of the enemy, took six and twenty elephants, collected the <lb/>
            rest, which were dispersed, with the aid of the Numidians <lb/>
            whom he had to assist him, and brought them to Rome in a <lb/>
            vast procession, filling all the roads with elephants, to the <lb/>
            number of a hundred and thirty.</p>
          <p>After these misfortunes, the Carthaginians entreated <lb/>
            Regulus, the Roman general whom they had taken, to go to <lb/>
            Rome, procure them peace from the Romans, and effect an <lb/>
            exchange of prisoners.</p><pb n="467"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="C.XXXVII.]"/> XXV. Regulus, on arriving at Rome, and being conducted <lb/>
            into the senate, would do nothing in the character of a Roman, <lb/>
            declaring that, “ from the day when he fell into the hands of <lb/>
            the Africans, he had ceased to be a Roman." For this reason <lb/>
            he both repelled his wife from embracing him, and gave his <lb/>
            advice to the Romans, that , peace should not be made with <lb/>
            the Carthaginians; for that they, dispirited by so many losses, <lb/>
            had no hope left; and that, with respect to himself, he was <lb/>
            not of such importance, that so many thousand captives should <lb/>
            be restored on his account alone, old as he was, and for the <lb/>
            sake of the few Romans who had been taken prisoners." He <lb/>
            accordingly carried his point, for no one would listen to the <lb/>
            Carthaginians, when they applied for peace. He himselt <lb/>
            returned to Carthage, telling the Romans, when they offered <lb/>
            to detain him at Rome, that he would not stay in a city, in <lb/>
            which, after living in captivity among the Africans, it was <lb/>
            impossible for him to retain the dignity of an honourable <lb/>
            citizen. Returning therefore to Africa, he was put to death <lb/>
            with torture of every description.</p>
          <p>XXVI. When Publius Claudius Pulcher and Caius Junius <lb/>
            were consuls, Claudius fought in opposition to the auspices, <lb/>
            and was defeated by the Carthaginians; for, out of two hundred <lb/>
            and twenty ships, he escaped with only thirty; ninety, together <lb/>
            with their men, were taken, the rest sunk, and twenty thou­ <lb/>
            sand men made prisoners. The other consul also lost his <lb/>
            fleet by shipwreck, but was able to save his troops, as the shore <lb/>
            was close at hand.</p>
          <p>XXVII. In the consulate of Caius Lutatius Catulus and <lb/>
            Aulus Posthumius Albinus, in the twenty-third year of the <lb/>
            Punic war, the conduct of the war against the Africans was <lb/>
            committed to Catulus. He set sail for Sicily with three hun­ <lb/>
            dred ships. The Africans fitted out four hundred against him. <lb/>
            Lutatius Catulus embarked in an infirm state of health, having <lb/>
            been wounded in a previous battle. An encounter took place <lb/>
            opposite Lilybæum, a city of Sicily, with the greatest valour <lb/>
            on the part of the Romans, for seventy-three of the Cartha­ <lb/>
            ginian ships were taken, and a hundred and twenty-five sunk ; <lb/>
            thirty-two thousand of the enemy were made prisoners, and <lb/>
            thirteen thousand slain ; and a vast sum in gold and silver fell <lb/>
            into the hands of the Romans. Of the Roman fleet twelve <lb/>
            ships were sunk The battle was fought on the lOth of <note type="footnote"> H H 2 </note> <pb n="468"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B. III."/> <lb/>
            of March. The Carthaginians immediately sued for peace, <lb/>
            and peace was granted them. The Roman prisoners who were <lb/>
            in the hands of the Carthaginians were restored; the Cartha. <lb/>
            ginians also requested permission to redeem such of the <lb/>
            Africans as the Romans kept in captivity. The senate <lb/>
            decided that those who were state prisoners should be restored <lb/>
            without ransom; but that those who were in the hands of <lb/>
            private persons should return to Carthage on the payment of <lb/>
            a sum to their owners; and that such payment should be <lb/>
            made from the public treasury, rather than by the Cartha­ <lb/>
            ginians.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. Quintus Lutatius and Aulius Manlius, being <lb/>
            created consuls, made war upon the Falisci, formerly a powerful <lb/>
            people of Italy, which war the consuls in conjunction brought <lb/>
            to a termination within six days after they took the field; fifteen <lb/>
            thousand of the enemy were slain, and peace was granted <lb/>
            to the rest, but half their land was taken from them.</p>

          <p>Ptolemy, king of Egypt, declines the aid offered him by the Romans <lb/>

          <p>I. THE Punic war being now ended, after having been pro­ <lb/>
            tracted though three and twenty years, the Romans, who were <lb/>
            now distinguished by transcendent glory, sent ambassadors to <lb/>
            Ptolemy, king of Egypt, with offers of assistance; for Antio­ <lb/>
            chus, king of Syria, had made war upon him. He returned <lb/>
            thanks to the Romans, but declined their aid, the struggle <lb/>
            being now over. About the same time, Hiero, the most <lb/>
            powerful king of S'icily, visited Rome to witness the games, <lb/>
            and distributed two hundred thousand modii * of wheat among <lb/>
            the people.</p>
          <p>II. In the consulship of Lucius Cornelius Lentulus and <lb/>
            Fulvius Flacous, in whose time Hiero came to Rome, war was <lb/>
            Carried on, within the limits of Italy, against the Ligurians, <note type="footnote">it See note on Corn. Nep. Life of Atticus, c. 2. </note> <pb n="469"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="C. VII.]"/> <lb/>
            and a triumph obtained over them. The Carthaginians, too, <lb/>
            at the same time, attempted to renew the war, soliciting the <lb/>
            Sardinians, who, by an article of the peace, were bound to <lb/>
            submit to the Romans, to rebel. A deputation, however, of <lb/>
            the Carthaginians came to Rome, and obtained peace.</p>
          <p>III. Under the consulate of Titus Manlius Torquatus and <lb/>
            Caius Attilius Bulbus, a triumph was obtained over the Sar­ <lb/>
            dinians ; and, peace being concluded on all sides, the Romans <lb/>
            bad now no war on their hands, a circumstance which had <lb/>
            happened to them but once before since the building of the <lb/>
            city, in the reign of Numa Pompilius.</p>
          <p>IV. Lucïus Posthumius Albinus and Cnæus Fulvius Centu­ <lb/>
            malus, when consuls, conducted a war against the Illyrians ; <lb/>
            and, having taken many of their towns, reduced their <lb/>
            kings to a surrender, and it was then for the first time that a <lb/>
            triumph was celebrated over the Illyrians.</p>
          <p>V. When Lucius Æmilius was consul, a vast force of the <lb/>
            Gauls crossed the Alps ; but all Italy united in favour of the <lb/>
            Romans; and it is recorded by Fabius the historian, who was <lb/>
            present in that war, that there were eight hundred thousand <lb/>
            men ready for the contest. Affairs, however, were brought to <lb/>
            a successful termination by the consul alone; forty thousand <lb/>
            of the enemy were killed, and a triumph decreed to Æmilius.</p>
          <p>VI. A few years after, a battle was fought with the Gauls <lb/>
            within the borders of Italy, and an end put to the war, in the <lb/>
            consulship of Marcus Claudius Marcellus and Cnæus Cor­ <lb/>
            nelius Scipio. Marcellus took the field with a small body of <lb/>
            horse, and slew the king of the Gauls, Viridomarus, with his <lb/>
            own hand. Afterwards, in conjunction with his colleague, he <lb/>
            cut to pieces a numerous army of the Gauls, stormed Milan, <lb/>
            and carried off a vast booty to Rome. Marcellus, at his <lb/>
            triumph, bore the spoils of the Gaul, fixed upon a pole on his <lb/>
            shoulders.</p>
          <p>VII. In the consulate of Marcus Minucius Rufus and <lb/>
            Publius Cornelius, war was made upon the Istrians, because <lb/>
            they had plundered some ships of the Romans, which were <lb/>
            bringing a supply of corn, and they were entirely subdued.</p>
          <p>In the same year the second Punic war was commenced <lb/>
            against the Romans by Hannibal, general of the Cartha­ <lb/>
            ginians, who, in the twentieth year of his age, proceeded to <lb/>
            besiege Saguntum, a city of Spain, in alliance with the <pb n="470"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B. III."/> <lb/>
            Romans, having assembled for that purpose an army of fifty <lb/>
            thousand foot and twenty thousand horse. The Romans <lb/>
            warned him, by deputies sent for the purpose, to desist from <lb/>
            Hostilities, but he refused them audience. The Romans sent <lb/>
            also to Carthage, requiring that orders should be sent to <lb/>
            Hannibal, not to make war on the allies of the Roman people; <lb/>
            but the reply made by the Carthaginians promised no com­ <lb/>
            pliance. The Saguntines in the meantime, worn out with <lb/>
            famine, were taken by Hannibal, and put to death with the <lb/>
            utmost cruelty.</p>
          <p>VIII. Publius Cornelius Scipio then went with an army <lb/>
            into Spain, and Tiberius Sempronius into Sicily. War was <lb/>
            declared against the Carthaginians. Hannibal, leaving his <lb/>
            brother Hasdrubal in Spain, passed the Pyrenees, and made <lb/>
            a way over the Alps, which, in that part, were previously <lb/>
            impassable. He is said to have brought into Italy eighty <lb/>
            thousand foot, twenty thousand horse, and thirty-seven ele­ <lb/>
            phants. Numbers of the Ligurians and Gauls joined him on <lb/>
            his march. Sempronius Gracchus, hearing of Hannibal's arri­ <lb/>
            val in Italy, conveyed over his army from Sicily to Ariminum.</p>
          <p>IX. The first to meet Hannibal was Publius Cornelius <lb/>
            Scipio ; a battle being commenced, and his troops put to flight, <lb/>
            he retired wounded into his camp. Sempronius Gracchus also <lb/>
            came to an engagement with him near the river Trebia, and he <lb/>
            too was defeated. Numbers in Italy submitted to Hannibal; <lb/>
            who, marching from thence into Tuscany, encountered the <lb/>
            consul Flaminius. Flaminius himself he cut off; and twenty- <lb/>
            five thousand of the Romans were slain; the rest saved them­ <lb/>
            selves by flight. Quintus Fabius Maximus was afterwards <lb/>
            sent by the Romans to oppose Hannibal. This general, by <lb/>
            avoiding an engagement, checked his impetuosity; and soon <lb/>
            after, finding a favourable opportunity, defeated him.</p>
          <p>X In the five hundred aud fortieth year from the founda­ <lb/>
            tion of the city, Lucius Æmilius and Publius Terentius Varro <lb/>
            were sent against Hannibal, and took the place of Fabius, who <lb/>
            forewarned both the consuls, that they could conquer Hannibal, <lb/>
            who was a bold and energetic leader, only by declining a <lb/>
            pitched battle with him. But an engagement being brought <lb/>
            on, through the impetuosity of the consul Varro, in opposition <lb/>
            to his colleague, near a village called Cannæ, in Apulia, both <lb/>
            the consuls were defeated by Hannibal. In this battle three <pb n="471"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="C. XII.]"/> <lb/>
            thousand of the Africans fell, and a great part of Hannibal’s <lb/>
            army were wounded. The Romans, however, never received <lb/>
            so severe a blow at any period of the Punic wars; for the <lb/>
            consul Æmilius Paulus was killed ; twenty officers of consular <lb/>
            and praetorian rank, thirty senators, and three hundred others <lb/>
            of noble descent, were taken or slain, as well as forty thousand <lb/>
            foot-soldiers, and three thousand five hundred horse. During <lb/>
            all these calamities, however, not one of the Romans deigned <lb/>
            to speak of peace. A number of slaves were set free and <lb/>
            made soldiers, a measure never before adopted.</p>
          <p>XI. After this battle, several cities of Italy, which bad been <lb/>
            subject to the Romans, went over to Hannibal. Hannibal <lb/>
            made proposals to the Romans concerning the redemption of <lb/>
            the prisoners, but the senate replied, that " such citizens as <lb/>
            would suffer themselves to be taken with arms in their hands <lb/>
            were of no value to them." Hannibal then put them all to <lb/>
            death with various tortures, and sent three modii * of gold <lb/>
            rings to Carthage, which he had taken from the fingers of <lb/>
            Roman knights, senators, and soldiers. In the meantime, <lb/>
            Hasdrubal, the brother of Hannibal, who had remained in <lb/>
            Spain with a numerous army, in order to reduce all that <lb/>
            country under the dominion of the Africans, was defeated there <lb/>
            by the two Scipios, the Roman generals, and lost thirty-five <lb/>
            thousand men in the battle; of these ten thousand were made <lb/>
            prisoners, and twenty-five thousand slain. Upon this, twelve <lb/>
            thousand foot, four thousand horse, and twenty elephants were <lb/>
            sent to him by the Carthaginians to reinforce his army.</p>
          <p>XII. In the fourth year after Hannibal's arrival in Italy, <lb/>
            Marcus Claudius Marcellus, one of the consuls, engaged him <lb/>
            with success at Nola, a city of Campania. But Hannibal <lb/>
            possessed himself of several of the Roman cities in Apulia, <lb/>
            Calabria, and the country of the Bruttii. About this time also <lb/>
            Philip, king of Macedonia, sent ambassadors to him, offering <lb/>
            him assistance against the Romans, on condition that, when he <lb/>
            had subdued them, he, in turn, should receive assistance from <lb/>
            Hannibal against the Greeks. But Philip's ambassadors being <lb/>
            taken, and the affair thus discovered, the Romans ordered <lb/>
            Marcus Valerius Lævinus to proceed to Macedonia, and Titus <lb/>
            Manlius, as proconsul, into Sardinia; for that island also, at <lb/>
            the solicitation of Hannibal, had revolted from the Romans <note type="footnote"> * See note on C. Nep. Life of Atticus, a. 2. </note></p><pb n="472"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="[B IV."/> XIII. Thus war was carried on at the same time in four <lb/>
            different places ; in Italy, against Hannibal; in Spain, against <lb/>
            Hasdrubal his brother; in Macedonia, against Philip; in <lb/>
            Sardinia, against the Sardinians and another Hasdrubal, also <lb/>
            a Carthaginian. Hasdrubal was taken alive by Titus Manlius <lb/>
            the proconsul, who had been sent into Sardinia; twelve thou­ <lb/>
            sand of his men were slain, fifteen hundred made prisoners, <lb/>
            and Sardinia brought under subjection to the Romans. Man <lb/>
            lius, being thus successful, brought Hasdrubal and his other <lb/>
            prisoners to Rome. In the meantime, Philip also was defeated <lb/>
            by Lævinus in Macedonia, and Hasdrubal and Mago, a third <lb/>
            brother of Hannibal, by the Scipios in Spain.</p>
          <p>XIV. In the tenth year after Hannibal's arrival in Italy, in <lb/>
            the consulship of Publius Sulpicius and Cnæus Fulvius, <lb/>
            Hannibal advanced within four miles of Rome, and his cavalry <lb/>
            rode up to the very gates; but soon after, through fear of the <lb/>
            consuls, who were coming upon him with an army, he with­ <lb/>
            drew into Campania. In Spain, the two Scipios, who had <lb/>
            been victorious for many years, were killed by his brother <lb/>
            Hasdrubal; the army however remained in full strength, for <lb/>
            the generals had been ensnared rather by accident than the <lb/>
            valour of the enemy. About this time, also, a great part of <lb/>
            Sicily, which the Africans had begun to appropriate, was <lb/>
            recovered by the consul Marcellus, and vast spoil brought to <lb/>
            Rome from the celebrated city of Syracuse In Macedonia, <lb/>
            Lævinus made an alliance with Philip, and several of the <lb/>
            Grecian states, as well as with AttaIns, king of Asia; and. <lb/>
            proceeding afterwards to Sicily, took Hanno, a general of the <lb/>
            Carthaginians, at the city of Agrigentum, together with the <lb/>
            town itself, and sent him with other noble prisoners to Rome. <lb/>
            Forty cities he obliged to surrender; twenty-six he carried by <lb/>
            storm. Thus all Sicily being recovered, and Macedonia <lb/>
            humbled, he returned with great glory to Rome. In Italy, <lb/>
            Hannibal, attacking Cnæus Fulvius, one of the consuls, by <lb/>
            surprise, cut him off, together with eight thousand of his <lb/>
            men.</p>
          <p>XV. In the meantime, Publius Cornelius Scipio, a man <lb/>
            almost the very first of all the Romans, both in his own and <lb/>
            succeeding ages, son of that Publius Scipio who had carried <lb/>
            on the war there before, was despatched, at the age of twenty- <lb/>
            four, into Spain, where, after the death of the two Scipios, no <pb n="473"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="C. XVIII.]"/> <lb/>
            Roman general was now left. He took Carthage, in Spain, in <lb/>
            which the Africans kept all their gold, and silver, and warlike <lb/>
            stores; he took also a number of hostages, whom the Cartha. <lb/>
            ginians had received from the Spaniards, as well as Mago, the <lb/>
            brother of Hannibal, whom he sent with others to Rome. <lb/>
            The rejoicing at Rome on this intelligence was very great. <lb/>
            Scipio restored the Spanish hostages to their parents; and in <lb/>
            consequence almost all the Spaniards unanimously joined him. <lb/>
            Soon after, he put to flight Hasdrubal, the brother of Hanni­ <lb/>
            bal, and took a great quantity of spoil.</p>
          <p>XVI. In Italy, meanwhile, Quintus Fabius Maximus, one <lb/>
            of the consuls, recovered Tarentum, where a great body of <lb/>
            Hannibal's troops were quartered, and cut off there also <lb/>
            Carthalo, one of Hannibal's general?; twenty-five thousand <lb/>
            of the prisoners he sold for slaves; the spoil he divided among <lb/>
            the soldiers; and the money arising from the sale of the <lb/>
            prisoners, he paid into the public treasury. At this time, <lb/>
            several of the Roman cities, which had gone over to Hannibal, <lb/>
            submitted themselves again to Fabius Maximus.</p>
          <p>In the following year Scipio performed extraordinary exploits <lb/>
            in Spain, and, by his own exertions and those of his brother, <lb/>
            Lucius Scipio, recovered seventy cities. In Italy, however, <lb/>
            the war went on unsuccessfully, for Claudius Marcellus the <lb/>
            consul was cut off by Hannibal.</p>
          <p>XVII. In the third year after Scipio's departure for Spain, <lb/>
            he again greatly distinguished himself. A king of Spain, <lb/>
            whom he had conquered in a great battle, he received into <lb/>
            alliance; and was the first that refrained from demanding <lb/>
            hostages of a vanquished enemy.</p>
          <p>XVIII. Hannibal, having no hope that Spain could be held <lb/>
            longer against Scipio, summoned from it Hasdrubal his <lb/>
            brother, with all his troops, to join him in Italy. Hasdrubal, <lb/>
            pursuing the same route by which Hannibal had gone, fell into <lb/>
            an ambush laid for him by the consuls Appius Claudius Nero <lb/>
            and Marcus Livius Salinator, near Sena, a city of Picenum, <lb/>
            but fell fighting valiantly; his numerous forces were either <lb/>
            taken or put to the sword; and a great quantity of gold and <lb/>
            silver carried off to Rome. Hannibal now began to despair of <lb/>
            the issue of the war, and an accession of courage was felt by <lb/>
            the Romans. They, therefore, also recalled Publius Cornelius <lb/>
            Scipio out of Spain; who arrived at Rome with great glory.</p><pb n="474"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.III."/> XIX. In the consulate of Quintus Cæcilius and Lucius <lb/>
            Valerius, all the cities in the territory of the Bruttii, whick <lb/>
            were in the possession of Hannibal, surrendered to the <lb/>
            Romans.</p>
          <p>XX. In the fourteenth year after Hannibal s invasion of <lb/>
            Italy, Scipio, who had achieved such successes in Spain, was <lb/>
            created consul, and sent into Africa; a man in whom there <lb/>
            was thought to be something divine, so that he was even <lb/>
            imagined to hold converse with the gods. He encountered <lb/>
            Hanno, the general of the Carthaginians in Africa, and <lb/>
            destroyed his army. In a second battle he took his camp, <lb/>
            with four thousand five hundred of his soldiers, eleven thou­ <lb/>
            sand being killed. Syphax, king of Numidia, who had joined <lb/>
            the Africans, be took prisoner, and became master of his <lb/>
            camp. Syphax himself, with the noblest of the Numidians, <lb/>
            and a vast quantity of spoil, was sent by Scipio to Rome; on the <lb/>
            news of which event, almost all Italy forsook Hannibal, who <lb/>
            was desired by the Carthaginians to return to Africa, which <lb/>
            Scipio was now laying waste.</p>
          <p>XXI. Thus, in the seventeenth year after his arrival, Italy <lb/>
            was delivered from Hannibal, and he is said to have quitted it <lb/>
            with tears. Ambassadors from the Carthaginians applied to <lb/>
            Scipio for peace, by whom they were sent to the senate, a <lb/>
            truce of forty-five days being allowed for their journey to and <lb/>
            from Rome; thirty thousand pounds of silver were accepted <lb/>
            from them. The senate directed that a peace should be con­ <lb/>
            cluded with the Carthaginians at the discretion of Scipio. <lb/>
            Scipio granted it on these conditions : " that they should retain <lb/>
            no more than thirty ships, that they should pay to the Romans <lb/>
            five hundred thousand pounds of silver, and restore all the <lb/>
            prisoners and deserters."</p>
          <p>XXII. Hannibal in the meantime landing in Africa, the <lb/>
            treaty was interrupted. Many hostilities were committed by <lb/>
            the Carthaginians; yet when their ambassadors, as they were <lb/>
            returning from Rome, were made prisoners by some Roman <lb/>
            troops, they were by Scipio’s orders set at liberty. Hannibal <lb/>
            too, being defeated by Scipio in several battles,. expressed also <lb/>
            himself a desire for peace. A conference being held, peace <note type="footnote"> * Frequentibus prœliis] Livy does not seem to think that any battle <lb/>
            took place before the conference ; he, however, mentions that Valerius <lb/>
            Antias speaks of one having occurred before it, b. XXX. 29. </note> <pb n="475"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="C. XXIII.]"/> <lb/>
            was offered on the same terms as before, only a hundred thou­ <lb/>
            sand pounds of silver were added to the former five hundred <lb/>
            thousand, on account of their late perfidy.. The terms were <lb/>
            unsatisfactory to the Carthaginians, and they ordered Han­ <lb/>
            nibal to continue the war.</p>
          <p>The war was carried by Scipio, and Masinissa, another <lb/>
            king of the Numidians, who had made an alliance with Scipio, <lb/>
            to the very walls of Carthage. Hannibal sent three spies <lb/>
            into Scipio’s camp, who were captured, and Scipio ordered <lb/>
            them to be led round the camp, the whole army to be shown <lb/>
            them, and themselves to be entertained and dismissed, that <lb/>
            they might report to Hannibal all that they had seen among <lb/>
            the Romans.</p>
          <p>XXIII. In the meantime preparations were made by both <lb/>
            generals for a battle, such as scarce ever occurred in any age, <lb/>
            since they were the ablest commanders that ever led forces <lb/>
            into the field. Scipio came off victorious, having almost <lb/>
            captured Hannibal himself, who escaped at first with several <lb/>
            horse, then with twenty, and at last with only four. There <lb/>
            were found in Hannibal's camp twenty thousand pounds of <lb/>
            silver, and eight hundred of gold, with plenty of stores. After <lb/>
            this battle, peace was concluded with the Carthaginians. <lb/>
            Scipio returned to Rome, and triumphed with the greatest <lb/>
            glory, receiving from that period the appellation of Africanus. <lb/>
            Thus the second Punic war was brought to an end in the <lb/>
            nineteenth year after it began. <note type="footnote"> * Propter novam perfidiam.] Eutropius, at the beginning of the <lb/>
            chapter, speaks of "many hostilities" having been committed by the <lb/>
            Carthaginians. "Before the arrival of Hannibal, and while their <lb/>
            ambassadors were on their way from Rome, the Carthaginians had <lb/>
            plundered a convoy of Scipio's driven into their harbour by stress of <lb/>
            weather, and had ill-treated some deputies whom Scipio had sent to <lb/>
            Carthage to complain of their conduct. See Polyb. xv. 1; Liv <lb/>

            against King Philip, succeeded.</p>
          <p>II. In the five hundred and fifty-first year from the build­ <lb/>
            ing of the city, Titus Quintius Flamininus was sent against <lb/>
            King Philip. He was successful in his undertaking; and <lb/>
            peace was granted to Philip on these conditions, that "he <lb/>
            should not make war on those states of Greece which the <lb/>
            Romans had defended against him; that he should restore <lb/>
            the prisoners and deserters ; that he should retain only fifty <lb/>
            vessels, and deliver up the rest to the Romans; that he should <lb/>
            pay, for ten years, a tribute of four thousand pounds weight <lb/>
            of silver; and give his own son Demetrius as a hostage." <lb/>
            Titus Quintius made war also on the Lacedæmonians; de­ <lb/>
            feated their general Nabis, and admitted them into alliance <lb/>
            on such terms as he thought proper. He led with great pride <lb/>
            before his chariot hostages of most noble rank, Demetrius the <lb/>
            son of Philip, and Armenes the son of Nabis.</p>
          <p>III. The Macedonian war being thus terminated, the <lb/>
            Syrian war, against King Antiochus, succeeded, in the consul­ <lb/>
            ship of Publius Cornelius Scipio and Manius Acilius Glabrio. <lb/>
            To this Antiochus Hannibal had joined himself, abandoning <lb/>
            his native country, Carthage, to escape being delivered up to <lb/>
            the Romans. Manius Acilius Glabrio fought successfully in <lb/>
            Achaia. The camp of King Antiochus was taken by an attack <lb/>
            in the night, and he himself obliged to flee To Philip his <pb n="477"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="C.VI.]"/> <lb/>
            son Demetrius was restored, for having assisted the Romans in <lb/>
            their contest with <unclear>Antiochus</unclear>.</p>
          <p>IV. In the consulate of Lucius Cornelius Scipio and Caius <lb/>
            Lælius, Scipio Africanus went out as lieutenant to his brother <lb/>
            Lucius Cornelius Scipio, the consul, against Antiochus. <lb/>
            Hannibal, who was with Antiochus, was defeated in a battle <lb/>
            by sea. Antiochus himself was afterwards routed by Cornelius <lb/>
            Scipio, the consul, in a great battle at Magnesia, a city of <lb/>
            Asia, near mount Sipylus. Eumenes, who founded the city <lb/>
            of Eumenia in Phrygia, the brother of king AttaIns, assisted <lb/>
            the Romans in that engagement. Fifty thousand foot, and <lb/>
            three thousand horse were killed in that battle on the side of <lb/>
            the king. In consequence, King Antiochus sued for peace, <lb/>
            which was granted to him, though vanquished, by the senate, <lb/>
            on the same conditions as it had been offered before : “ that he <lb/>
            should withdraw from Europe and Asia, and confine himself <lb/>
            within mount Taurus; that he should pay ten thousand <lb/>
            talents, and give twenty hostages, and surrender Hannibal, <lb/>
            the author of the war." All the cities of Asia, which Antio­ <lb/>
            chus had lost in this war, were given to Eumenes; many <lb/>
            cities also were granted to the Rhodians, who had assisted the <lb/>
            Romans against Antiochus. Scipio returned to Rome, <lb/>
            and celebrated his triumph with great pomp; and he also, <lb/>
            after the example of his brother, received the name of <lb/>
            Asiaticus, from his conquest of Asia; as his brother, from <lb/>
            the subjugation of Africa, had been surnamed Africanus.</p>
          <p>V. Under the consuls Spurius Posthumius Albinus and <lb/>
            Quintus Marcius Philippus, Marcus Fulvius triumphed for <lb/>
            conquering the Ætolians. Hannibal, who, on the defeat of <lb/>
            Antiochus, had fled to Prusias, king of Bithynia, that he <lb/>
            might not be surrendered to the Romans, was demanded also <lb/>
            at his hands by Titus Quintius Flamininus; and, as he <lb/>
            seemed likely to be surrendered, he drank poison, and was <lb/>
            buried at Libyssa, in the territory of the Nicomedians.</p>
          <p>VI. On the death of Philip, king of Macedonia, who had <lb/>
            both waged war with the Romans, and afterwards given aid <lb/>
            to the Romans against Antiochus, his son Perseus took up <lb/>
            arms again in Macedonia, having levied great forces for the <lb/>
            war, and having as allies Cotys, king of Thrace, and the king <lb/>
            of Illyricum, whose name was Gentius. On the side of the <lb/>
            Romans were Eumenes, king of Asia, Ariarathes of Cappa. <pb n="478"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.IV."/> <lb/>
            docia, Antiochus of Syria, Ptolemy of Egypt, Masinissa of <lb/>
            Numidia. Prusias, the king of Bithynia, although he had <lb/>
            married the sister of Perseus, remained neutral. The general <lb/>
            of the Romans, the consul Publius Licinius, was defeated by <lb/>
            Perseus in a severe engagement; yet the Romans, although <lb/>
            vanquished, refused peace to the king when he solicited it, <lb/>
            except on condition that he should surrender himself and his <lb/>
            people to the senate and the people of Rome. The consul <lb/>
            Lucius Æmilius Paulus was afterwards sent against him. <lb/>
            and the prætor Caius Anicius into Illyricum against Gen­ <lb/>
            tius: but Gentius, being defeated with ease in a single battle, <lb/>
            soon surrendered ; and his mother, his wife, his two sons, <lb/>
            and his brother, fell at the same time into the power of the <lb/>
            Romans. Thus the war was terminated within thirty days, <lb/>
            and the news of Gentius's defeat arrived before it was an­ <lb/>
            nounced that the war had been begun.</p>
          <p>VII. The consul Æmilius Paulus came to a battle with <lb/>
            Perseus on the 3rd of September, and defeated him, killing <lb/>
            twenty thousand of his infantry ; the cavalry which remained <lb/>
            with the king was unbroken; on the side of the Romans only <lb/>
            a hundred men were missing. All the cities of Macedonia, <lb/>
            that Perseus had under his sway, submitted to the Romans. <lb/>
            The king himself, deserted by his friends, fell into the hands <lb/>
            of Paulus ; but Paulus treated him with respect, and not as <lb/>
            a vanquished enemy, for, when he desired to prostrate himself <lb/>
            at his feet, he would not permit him, but placed him in a <lb/>
            seat by his side. The terms granted to the Macedonians and <lb/>
            Illyrians were these, " that they might remain free, on paying <lb/>
            half the tribute which they had been accustomed to pay to <lb/>
            their kings;" that it might be seen that the Roman people <lb/>
            contended with a view to equity and not to covetousness: <lb/>
            and these terms Paulus proclaimed in an assembly of a vast <lb/>
            concourse of people, entertaining the ambassadors of several <lb/>
            states, who had come to pay their respects to him, with a most <lb/>
            sumptuous feast; saying that "it ought to be possible for the <lb/>
            same individual to be victorious in war and elegant in his <lb/>
            entertainments."</p>
          <p>VIII. Shortly after he took seventy cities of Epirus, which <lb/>
            had resumed hostilities; the booty he distributed among his <lb/>
            soldiers. He then returned to Rome with great display, in a <lb/>
            vessel belonging to Perseus, which is recorded to have been of <pb n="479"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="C.XI.]"/> <lb/>
            such extraordinary magnitude, that it contained sixteen banks <lb/>
            of oars. He celebrated his triumph most magnificently in a <lb/>
            golden car, with his two sons standing on each side of him; <lb/>
            the two sons of Perseus, and Perseus himself, then forty-five <lb/>
            years of age, were led in procession before the car. After <lb/>
            Æmilius, Caius Anicius also celebrated a triumph on account <lb/>
            of the Illyrians; in which Gentius, with his brother and sons, <lb/>
            were led before his car. To witness this spectacle the kings of <lb/>
            several nations came to Rome; among others, even Attains <lb/>
            and Eumenes, kings of Asia, and Prusias, king of Bithynia; <lb/>
            who were entertained with great consideration, and, by per­ <lb/>
            mission of the senate, deposited the presents which they had <lb/>
            brought in the Capitol. Prusias also entrusted his son Nico­ <lb/>
            medes to the senate.</p>
          <p>IX. In the year following Lucius Memmius was successful <lb/>
            in the war in Spain. Marcellus the consul afterwards met <lb/>
            with success in the same country.</p>
          <p>X. A third war was then undertaken against Carthage, in <lb/>
            the six hundred and second* year from the building of the <lb/>
            city, in the consulship of Lucius Manlius Censorinus and <lb/>
            Marcus Manilius, and in the fifty-first year after the termina­ <lb/>
            tion of the second Punic war. The consuls in consequence <lb/>
            proceeded to attack Carthage. Hasdrubal, the Carthaginian <lb/>
            general, engaged them; Phamea, another general, had the <lb/>
            command of the Carthaginian cavalry. At that time, Scipio, <lb/>
            the grandson of Scipio Africanus, served in the army in the <lb/>
            capacity of tribune, for whom great fear and respect was felt <lb/>
            by all; for he was regarded as eminently brave and skilful in <lb/>
            the field. Many enterprises were accordingly conducted with <lb/>
            success by his agency; nor did Hasdrubal or Phamea shrink <lb/>
            from anything more than engaging with that part of the army <lb/>
            in which Scipio commanded.</p>
          <p>XI. About the same time, Masinissa, king of Numidia, who <lb/>
            had been an ally of the Roman people for nearly sixty years, <lb/>
            died in the ninety-seventh year of his age, leaving behind him <note type="footnote"> * Altero.] The Greek translator gives <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑνὶ</foreign>, in which signification he <lb/>
            seems to have taken altero ; as also in i 18. On this point the learned <lb/>
            are constantly disputing, and especially on the 49th epitome of Livy, <lb/>
            where Duker does not decide whether alter signifies first or second.— <lb/>
            Tzschucke. I consider that alter, used as in this passage, and as in i. 18, <lb/>
            always signifies second. In such phrases as alter ab undecimo, Virg <lb/>
            Eel. viii. 39, it of course has a different signification. </note> <pb n="480"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.IV."/> <lb/>
            forty-four sons. He appointed Scipio to divide his kingdom <lb/>
            amongst his sons</p>
          <p>XII. As the name of Scipio had already become famous, he <lb/>
            was created consul, although but a young man, and sent <lb/>
            against Carthage. He took it and demolished it: the spoils <lb/>
            found there, which had been amassed by Carthage from the <lb/>
            ruins of various cities, and the ornaments of towns, he restored <lb/>
            to such cities of Sicily, Italy, and Africa, as recognized their <lb/>
            own. Thus Carthage, in the seven hundredth year after its <lb/>
            foundation, was destroyed. Scipio earned the same title which <lb/>
            his grandfather had gained, being, on account of his valour, <lb/>
            called Africanus Junior.</p>
          <p>XIII, In the meantime a certain Pseudo-Philip took up <lb/>
            arms in Macedonia, and defeated Publius Juvencius, a Roman <lb/>
            praetor, who had been sent out against him, with a terrible <lb/>
            slaughter. After him Quintus Cæcilius Metellus was sent by <lb/>
            the Romans as general against this pretended Philip, and, <lb/>
            having slain twenty-five thousand of his soldiers, recovered <lb/>
            Macedonia, and took the impostor himself prisoner.</p>
          <p>XIV. War was also declared against Corinth, the noblest <lb/>
            city of Greece, on account of an affront offered to a Roman <lb/>
            embassy. That city Mummius the consul took and demolished. <lb/>
            Three most remarkable triumphs therefore were celebrated at <lb/>
            Rome at the same time, that of Scipio for Africa, before whose <lb/>
            chariot Hasdrubal was led ; that of Metellus for Macedonia. <lb/>
            before whose chariot walked Andriscus, also called Pseudo- <lb/>
            Philip ; and that of Mummius for Corinth, before whom brazen <lb/>
            statues, pictures, and other ornaments of that celebrated city, <lb/>
            were carried.</p>
          <p>XV. In Macedonia, meanwhile, a Pseudo-Perseus, who <lb/>
            called himself the son of Perseus, collecting the slaves, took <lb/>
            up arms, and, when he was at the head of a force of seven­ <lb/>
            teen thousand fighting men, was defeated by Tremellius the <lb/>
            quæstor. FAt this time a hermaphrodite was discovered at <lb/>
            Rome, and drowned in the sea by order of the soothsayers.]*</p>
          <p>XVI. About the same time Metellus had singular success <note type="footnote"> <unclear/>* The sentence in brackets is not found in all manuscripts; nor is <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="C. XX.]"/> <lb/>
            against the Spaniards in Celtiberia. Quintus Pompeius suc­ <lb/>
            ceeded him. Not long after Quintus Cæpio was also sent to <lb/>
            the same war, which a leader named Viriathus was still keep­ <lb/>
            ing up against the Romans in Lusitania; through fear of <lb/>
            whom Viriathus was killed by his own men, after he had kept <lb/>
            Spain in a state of excitement against the Romans for fourteen <lb/>
            years. He was at first a shepherd, then captain of a band of <lb/>
            robbers, and at last he stirred up so many powerful nations to <lb/>
            war, that he was considered as the protector of Spain against <lb/>
            the Romans. When his assassins asked a reward of the <lb/>
            consul Cæpio, they received for answer, that “ it was never <lb/>
            pleasing to the Romans, that It. general should be killed by his <lb/>
            own soldiers."</p>
          <p>XVII. The consul Quintus Pompeius being afterwards de­ <lb/>
            feated by the Numantines, the most powerful nation of Spain, <lb/>
            made an ignominious peace with them. After him, the consul <lb/>
            Caius Hostilius Mancinus again concluded a dishonourable <lb/>
            peace with the Numantines, which the people and senate <lb/>
            ordered to be annulled, and Mancinus himself to be given up <lb/>
            to the enemy, that they might avenge themselves for the <lb/>
            dissolution of the treaty on him with whom they had made it.. <lb/>
            After such signal disgrace, therefore, with which the Roman <lb/>
            armies had been twice defeated by the Numantines, Publius <lb/>
            Scipio Africanus was made consul a second time, and sent to <lb/>
            Numantia. He reformed, in the first place, the dissolute and <lb/>
            idle soldiery, rather by inuring them to labour than by punish­ <lb/>
            ment, and without any great severity. He then took several <lb/>
            cities of Spain, some by force, and allowing others to surren­ <lb/>
            der. At last he reduced Numantia itself by famine after it <lb/>
            had been long besieged, and razed it to the ground, and <lb/>
            received the rest of the province into alliance.</p>
          <p>XVIII. About this time Attalus, king of Asia, the brother <lb/>
            of Eumenes, died, and left the Roman people his heir. Thus <lb/>
            Asia was added to the Roman empire by will.</p>
          <p>XIX. Shortly after, also, Decimus Junius Brutus triumphed <lb/>
            with great glory over the Gallæcians aud Lusitanians; and <lb/>
            Publius Scipio Africanus had a second triumph over the Nu­ <lb/>
            mantines, in the fourteenth year after his first triumph for his <lb/>
            exploits in Africa.</p>
          <p>XX. A war in the meantime was kindled in Asia by Aris­ <note type="footnote"> <unclear/>* See Florus, ii. 18; Vell. Pat. ii 1, 90, Bohn's Cl. Library. </note> <note type="footnote"> I I </note> <pb n="482"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.IV"/> <lb/>
            tonicus, the son of Eumenes by a concubine : this Eumenes <lb/>
            was the brother of Attalus. Against him was sent out Publius <lb/>
            Licinius Crassus, who had ample assistance from several kings, <lb/>
            for not only Nicomedes, the king of Bithynia, supported the <lb/>
            Romans, but also Mithridates king of Pontus, with whom they <lb/>
            had afterwards a very great war, as well as Ariarathes, king of <lb/>
            Cappadocia, and Pylæmenes of Paphlagonia. Crassus not­ <lb/>
            withstanding was defeated, and killed in battle; his head was <lb/>
            carried to Aristonicus, and his body buried at Smyrna. Soon <lb/>
            after Perperna, the Roman consul, who was appointed suc­ <lb/>
            cessor to Crassus, hearing of the event of the war, hastened to <lb/>
            Asia; and defeating Aristonicus in battle, near the city Strato­ <lb/>
            nice to which he had fled, reduced him by famine to surrender. <lb/>
            Aristonicus, by command of the senate, was strangled in <lb/>
            prison at Rome ; for a triumph could not be celebrated on his <lb/>
            account, because Perperna had died at Pergamus on his <lb/>
            return.</p>
          <p>XXI. In the consulate of Lucius Cæcilius Metellus and <lb/>
            Titus Quintius Flamininus, Carthage in Africa, which still <lb/>
            exists, was rebuilt by order of the senate, two and twenty years <lb/>
            after it had been destroyed by Scipio. A colony of Roman <lb/>
            citizens was sent out thither.</p>
          <p>XXII. In the six hundred and twenty-seventh year from <lb/>
            the founding of the city, Caius Cassius Longinus and Sextus <lb/>
            Domitius Calvinus, the consuls, made war upon the Trans <lb/>
            alpine Gauls, and the city of the Arverni, at that time very <lb/>
            distinguished, and their king, Bituitus; and slew a vast <lb/>
            number of men near the river Rhone. A great booty, consist­ <lb/>
            ing of the golden collars of the Gauls, was brought to Rome. <lb/>
            Bituitus surrendered himself to Domitius, and was conveyed <lb/>
            by him to Rome; and both consuls triumphed with great <lb/>
            glory.</p>
          <p>XXIII. In the consulship of Marcus Porcius Cato and <lb/>
            Quintus Marcius Rex, in the six hundred and thirty-third year <lb/>
            from the building of the city, a colony was led out to Narbonne <lb/>
            in Gaul. Afterwards a triumph was obtained over Dalmatia <lb/>
            by the consuls Lucius Metellus and Quintus Mucius Scævola.</p>
          <p>XXIV. In the six hundred and thirty-fifth year from the <lb/>
            building of the city, the consul Caius Cato made war upon the <lb/>
            Sc ordisci, and fought with them to his dishonour.</p>
          <p>XXV. When emus Cæcilius Metellus and Cnæus Carbn <pb n="483"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="C. XXVII. ]"/> <lb/>
            were consuls, the Metelli, two brothers, had triumphs on the <lb/>
            same day, one for Sardinia, the other for Thrace; and news <lb/>
            was brought to Rome, that the Cimbri had crossed from Gaul <lb/>
            into Italy.</p>
          <p>XXVI. In the consulship of Publius Scipio Nasica and <lb/>
            Lucius Calpurnius Bestia, war was made upon Jugurtha, king <lb/>
            of Numidia, because he had murdered Adherbal and Riempsal, <lb/>
            the sons of Micipsa, his cousins, princes, and allies of the <lb/>
            Roman people. The consul Calpurnius Bestia being sent <lb/>
            against him, was corrupted by the king's money, and con­ <lb/>
            cluded a most ignominious treaty of peace with him, which <lb/>
            was afterwards repudiated by the senate. Spurius Albinus <lb/>
            Postumius proceeded against him in the following year: he <lb/>
            also, through the agency of his brother, fought against the <lb/>
            Numidians to his disgrace.</p>
          <p>XXVII. In the third place, the consul Quintus Cæcilius <lb/>
            Metellas being sent out against him, brought back the army, <lb/>
            which he reformed with great severity and judgment, without <lb/>
            exercising cruelty on any one, to the ancient Roman discipline. <lb/>
            He defeated Jugurtha in various battles, killed or captured his <lb/>
            elephants, and obliged many of his towns to surrender ; and, <lb/>
            when on the point of putting an end to the war, was succeeded <lb/>
            by Caius Marius. Marius overthrew both Jugurtha and Boc­ <lb/>
            chus, the king of Mauritania, who had undertaken to afford <lb/>
            assistance to Jugurtha; he also took several towns in Numidia, <lb/>
            and put an end to the war, having, through the instrumentality <lb/>
            of his quæstor Cornelius Sylla, a distinguished man, taken <lb/>
            Jugurtha prisoner, whom Bocchus, who had before fought for <lb/>
            him, betrayed.</p>
          <p>In Gaul, the Cimbri were defeated by Marcus Junius <lb/>
            Silanus, the colleague of Quintus Metellus, the Scordisci and <lb/>

            on account of Jugurtha, the first by Metellus, the second by <lb/>
            Marius. It was before the chariot of Marius, however, that <lb/>
            Jugurtha, with his two sons, was led in chains; and he was <lb/>
            soon after, by order of the consul, strangled in prison. <note type="footnote"> I I 2 </note></p><pb n="484"/>

          <p>I. WHILE the war was going on in Numidia against Jugurtha, <lb/>
            the Roman consuls, Marcus Manlius and Quintus Cæpio, were <lb/>
            defeated by the Cimbri, Teutones, Tigurini, and Ambroues, <lb/>
            nations of Germany and Gaul, near the river Rhone; and, <lb/>
            being reduced by a terrible slaughter, lost their very camp, as <lb/>
            well as the greater part of their army. Great was the con­ <lb/>
            sternation at Rome, such as was scarcely experienced during <lb/>
            the Punic wars in the time of Hannibal, from dread that the <lb/>
            Gauls might again march to the city. Marius, in consequence, <lb/>
            after his victory over Jugurtha, was created consul the second <lb/>
            time, and the war against the Cimbri and Teutones was com­ <lb/>
            mitted to his management. The consulship was also conferred <lb/>
            on him a third and fourth time, in consequence of the war <lb/>
            with the Cimori being protracted; but in his fourth consul­ <lb/>
            ship he had for his colleague Quintus Lutatius Catulus. He <lb/>
            came to battle, accordingly,* with the Cimbri, and in two <lb/>
            engagements killed two hundred thousand of the enemy, and <lb/>
            took eighty thousand prisoners, with their general Teutobo­ <lb/>
            dus ; for which service he was elected consul a fifth time <lb/>
            during his absence.</p>
          <p>II. In the meantime the Cimbri and Teutones, whose <lb/>
            force was still innumerable, passed over into Italy. Another <lb/>
            battle was fought with them, by Caius Marius and Quintus <lb/>
            Catulus, though with greater success on the part of Catulus, <lb/>
            for in that battle, in which they both commanded, a hundred <lb/>
            and forty thousand were either slain in the field or in the pur­ <lb/>
            suit, and sixty thousand taken prisoners. Of the Roman <lb/>
            soldiers in the two armies three hundred fell. Thirty-three <lb/>
            standards were taken from the Cimbri; of which the army <lb/>
            of Marius captured two, that of Catulus thirty-one. This <lb/>
            was the end of the war: a triumph was decreed to both the <lb/>
            consuls.</p>
          <p>III. In the consulship of Sextus Julius Cæsar and Lucius <note type="footnote"> * Itaque.] Eutropius seems to intimate that it was because Marius <lb/>
            had Catulus for his colleague that he proceeded to engage the Cimbri. </note> <pb n="485"/>

            Marcius Pbilippus, in the six hundred and fifty-ninth year <lb/>
            from the building of the city, when almost all other wars were <lb/>
            at an end, the Piceni, Marsi, and Peligni, excited a most <lb/>
            dangerous war in Italy; for after they had lived for many <lb/>
            years in subjection to the Roman people, they now began to <lb/>
            assert their claim to equal privileges. This was a very de­ <lb/>
            structive war. Publius Rutilius, one of the consuls, Cæpio, a <lb/>
            nobleman in the flower of his age, and Porcius Cato, another <lb/>
            consul, were killed in it. The generals against the Romans <lb/>
            on the part of the Piceni and Marsi were Titus Vettius, <lb/>
            Hierius Asinius, Titus Herennius, and Aulus Cluentius. <lb/>
            The Romans fought against them successfully under the con­ <lb/>
            duct of Caius Marius, who had now been made consul for the <lb/>
            sixth time, also under Cnaeus Pompey, but particularly under <lb/>
            Lucius Cornelius Sylla, who, among other signal exploits. <lb/>
            so completely routed Cluentius, one of the enemy's generals, <lb/>
            with his numerous forces, that he lost only one man of his own <lb/>
            army. The war, however, was protracted for four years, with <lb/>
            great havoc; at length, in the fifth, it was terminated by <lb/>
            Lucius Cornelius Sylla when consul, who had greatly dis­ <lb/>
            tinguished himself on many occasions when prætor in the <lb/>
            same war.</p>
          <p>IV. In the six hundred and sixty second year from the <lb/>
            foundation of the city, the first civil war began at Rome ; and <lb/>
            in the same year also the Mithridatic war. Marius, when in <lb/>
            his sixth consulship, gave rise to the Civil war; for when <lb/>
            Sylla, the consul, was sent to conduct the war against Mithri­ <lb/>
            dates, who had possessed himself of Asia and Achaia, and <lb/>
            delayed his army for a short time in Campania, in order that <lb/>
            the remains of the Social war, of which we have just spoken, <lb/>
            and which had been carried on within the limits of Italy, <lb/>
            might be extinguished, Marius showed himself ambitious to <lb/>
            be appointed to the Mithridatic war. Sylla, being incensed at <lb/>
            this conduct, marched to Rome with his army. There he <lb/>
            fought with Marius and Sulpicius; he was the first to enter <lb/>
            the city in arms; Sulpicius he killed ; Marius he put to flight; <lb/>
            and then, having appointed Cnæus Octavius and Lucius Cor­ <lb/>
            nelius Cinna the consuls for the year ensuing, set out for <lb/>
            Asia.</p>
          <p>V. For Mithridates, who was king of Pontus, and possessed <lb/>
            Armenia Minor and the entire circuit of the Pontic sea with <pb n="486"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.V."/> <lb/>
            the Bosphorus, first attempted to expel Nicomedes, an ally of <lb/>
            the Romans, from Bithynia; sending word to the senate, that <lb/>
            he was going to make war upon him on account of the injuries <lb/>
            which he had received. Answer was returned by the senate to <lb/>
            Mithridates, that if he did so he himself should feel the <lb/>
            weight of a war from the Romans. Incensed at this reply, he <lb/>
            immediately invaded Cappadocia, and expelled from thence <lb/>
            Ariobarzanes the king, an ally of the Roman people. He next <lb/>
            marched into Bithynia and Paphlagonia, driving out the kings, <lb/>
            Pylæmenes and Nicomedes, who were also in alliance with the <lb/>
            Romans. He then hastened to Ephesus, and sent letters into <lb/>
            all parts of Asia, with directions that wherever any Roman <lb/>
            citizens should be found, they should all be put to death the <lb/>
            same day.</p>
          <p>VI. In the meantime Athens also, a city of Achaia, was <lb/>
            delivered up to Mithridates by Aristion an Athenian. For <lb/>
            Mithridates had previously sent Archelaus, his general, into <lb/>
            Achaia, with a hundred and twenty thousand horse and foot, by <lb/>
            whom the rest of Greece was also occupied. Sylla besieged <lb/>
            Archelaus at the Piræeus near Athens, and took the city itself. <lb/>
            Engaging afterwards in battle with Archelaus, he gave him <lb/>
            such a defeat, that out of a hundred and twenty thousand of <lb/>
            the army of Archelaus scarce ten remained; while of that of <lb/>
            Sylla only fourteen were killed. Mithridates, on receiving <lb/>
            intelligence of this battle, sent seventy thousand chosen troops <lb/>
            out of Asia to Archelaus, with whom Sylla came again to an <lb/>
            engagement. In the first battle twenty thousand of the enemy <lb/>
            were slain, and Diogenes, the son of Archelaus ; in the second <lb/>
            the entire forces of Mithridates were cut off. Archelaus <lb/>
            himself lay hid for three days, stript of his armour, in the <lb/>
            marshes. On the news of this state of things, Mithridates <lb/>
            sent orders to treat with Sylla concerning peace.</p>
          <p>VII. In the meantime Sylla also reduced part of the Dar. <lb/>
            danians, Scordisci, Dalmatians, and Mcedians, and granted <lb/>
            terms of alliance to the rest. But when ambassadors arrived <lb/>
            from King Mithridates to treat about peace, Sylla replied <lb/>
            that he would grant it on no other condition than that he <lb/>
            should quit the countries on which he had seized, and with­ <lb/>
            draw into his own dominions. Afterwards, however, the two <lb/>
            came to a conference, and peace was settled between them, in <lb/>
            order that Sylla, who was in haste to proceed to the Civil war. <pb n="487"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="C. IX.]"/> <lb/>
            might leave no danger in his rear ; for while Sylla was victo. <lb/>
            nous over Mithridates in Achaia and Asia, Marius, who had <lb/>
            been driven from the city, and Cornelius Cinna, one of the <lb/>
            consuls, had recommenced hostilities in Italy, and entering <lb/>
            Rome, put to death the noblest of the senators and others of <lb/>
            consular rank, proscribed many, and pulling down the house of <lb/>
            Sylla himself, forced his sons and wife to seek safety by flight; <lb/>
            while all the rest of the senate, hastily quitting the city, fled <lb/>
            to Sylla in Greece, entreating him to come to the support of <lb/>
            his country. He accordingly crossed over into Italy, to con­ <lb/>
            duct the Civil war against the consuls Norbanus and Scipio. <lb/>
            In the first battle he engaged with Norbanus not far from Capua, <lb/>
            when he killed seven thousand of his men, and took six thou­ <lb/>
            sand prisoners, losing only a hundred and twenty-four of his <lb/>
            own army. From thence he directed his efforts against <lb/>
            Scipio, and before a battle was fought, or any blood shed, he <lb/>
            received the surrender of his whole army.</p>
          <p>VIII. But on a change of consuls at Rome, and the election <lb/>
            of Marius, the son of Marius, and Papirius Carbo to the con­ <lb/>
            sulate, Sylla again came to battle with Marius the younger, <lb/>
            and killed fifteen thousand men, with the loss of only four <lb/>
            hundred. Immediately afterwards also he entered the city. <lb/>
            He then pursued Marius, the younger, to Præneste, be­ <lb/>
            sieged him there, and drove him even to self-destruction. He <lb/>
            afterwards fought a terrible battle with LamponiuR and Cari­ <lb/>
            nas, the leaders of the Marian faction, near the Colline gate. <lb/>
            The number of the enemy in that battle against Sylla is said <lb/>
            to have been seventy thousand ; twelve thousand surrendered <lb/>
            themselves to Sylla: the rest were cut off in the field, in the <lb/>
            camp, or in the pursuit, by the insatiable resentment of the <lb/>
            conqueror. Cnæus Carbo also, the other consul, fled from <lb/>
            Ariminum into Sicily, and was there slain by Cnæus Pompey; <lb/>
            to whom, although but a young man, being only one-and-twenty <lb/>
            years of age, Sylla, perceiving his activity, had committed the <lb/>
            management of his troops, so that he was accounted second <lb/>
            only to Sylla himself.</p>
          <p>IX. Carbo, then, being killed, Pompey recovered Sicily. <lb/>
            Crossing next over into Africa, he put to death Domitius, a <lb/>
            leader on the side of Marius, and Hiarbas the king of Mauri­ <lb/>
            tania, who had given assistance to Domitius. After these <lb/>
            events, Sylla celebrated a triumph with great pomp for his <pb n="488"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VI."/> <lb/>
            success against Mithridates. Cnæus Pompey also, while only <lb/>
            in his twenty-fourth year, was allowed a triumph for his victo­ <lb/>
            ries in Africa, a privilege which had been granted to no Roman <lb/>
            before him. Such was the termination of two most lament­ <lb/>
            able wars, the Italian, also called the Social, and the Civil, <lb/>
            which lasted for ten years, and occasioned the destruction of <lb/>
            more than a hundred and fifty thousand men ; twenty-four of <lb/>
            consular rank, seven of praetorian, sixty of that of ædile, and <lb/>
            nearly three hundred senators.</p>

          <p>I.. IN the consulate of Marcus ..Emilius Lepidus and <lb/>
            Quintus Catulus, after Sylla had composed the troubles of the <lb/>
            state, new wars broke out; one in Spain, another in Pamphylia <lb/>
            and Cilicia, a third in Macedonia, a fourth in Dalmatia. Ser­ <lb/>
            torius. who had taken the side of Marius, dreading the fate of <lb/>
            others who had been cut off, excited the Spaniards to a war. <lb/>
            The generals sent against him were Quintus Cæcilius Metellus, <lb/>
            the son of that Metellus who had subdued Jugurtha, and the <lb/>
            prætor Lucius Domitius. Domitius was killed by Hirtuleius, <lb/>
            Sertorius's general. Metellus contended against Sertorius <lb/>
            with various success. At length, as Metellus was thought <lb/>
            singly unequal to the way, Cnaeus Pompey was sent into Spain. <lb/>
            Thus, two generals being opposed to him, Sertorius often <lb/>
            fought with very uncertain fortune. At last, in the eighth <lb/>
            year of the war, he was put to death by his own soldiers, and <lb/>
            an end made of the war by Cnæus Pompey, at that time but a <lb/>
            young man, and Quintus Metellus Pius; and nearly the whole <lb/>
            of Spain was brought under the dominion of the Roman <lb/>
            people.</p><pb n="489"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="C. VI.]"/> II. Appius Claudius, on the expiration of his consulate <lb/>
            was sent into Macedonia. He had some skirmishes with <lb/>
            different tribes that inhabited the province of Rhodopa,* and <lb/>
            there fell ill and died. Cnæus Scribonius Curio, on the <lb/>
            termination of his consulship, was sent to succeed him. He <lb/>
            conquered the Dardaniaus, penetrated as far as the Danube, <lb/>
            and obtained the honour of a triumph, putting an end to the <lb/>
            war within three years.</p>
          <p>III. Publius Servilius, an energetic man, was sent, after his <lb/>
            consulate, into Cilicia and Pamphylia. He reduced Cilicia, <lb/>
            besieged and took the most eminent cities of Lycia, amongst <lb/>
            them Phaselis, Olympus, and Corycus. The Isauri he also <lb/>
            attacked, and compelled to surrender, and, within three years, <lb/>
            put an end to the war. He was the first of the Romans that <lb/>
            marched over Mount Taurus. On his return, he was granted <lb/>
            a triumph, and acquired the surname of Isauricus.</p>
          <p>IV. Cnæus Cosconius was sent into Illyricum as proconsul. <lb/>
            He reduced a great part of Dalmatia, took Salonæ, and, having <lb/>
            made an end of the war, returned to Rome after an absence <lb/>
            of two years.</p>
          <p>V. About the same time, the consul Marcus Æmilius <lb/>
            Lepidus, the colleague of Catulus, attempted to kindle a civil <lb/>
            war; but in one summer that commotion was suppressed. <lb/>
            Thus there were several triumphs at the same time, that of <lb/>
            Metellus for Spain, a second for Spain obtained by Pompey, <lb/>
            one of Curio for Macedonia, and one of Servilius for Isauria.</p>
          <p>VI. In the six hundred and seventy-sixth year from the <lb/>
            building of the city, in the consulate of Lucius Licinius <lb/>
            Lucullus and Marcus Aurelius Cotta, Nicomedes, king of <lb/>
            Bithynia, died, appointing by his will the Roman people his <lb/>
            heir.</p>
          <p>Mithridates, breaking the peace, again proceeded to invade <lb/>
            Bithynia and Asia. Both the consuls being sent out against <lb/>
            him, met with various success. Cotta, being defeated by him <lb/>
            in a battle near Chalcedon, was even forced into the town, and <unclear/> <lb/>
            ieged there. But Mithridates, having marched from thence <lb/>
            to Cyzicus, that, after capturing that city, he might overrun all <lb/>
            Asia, Lucullus, the other consul, met him ; and, whilst Mithri­ <lb/>
            dates was detained at the siege of Cyzicus, besieged him in <note type="footnote"> * Lying on the river Melas, above the Hellespont, neat the Pro­ <lb/>

            the real, exhausted him with famine, defeated him in several <lb/>
            battles, and at last pursued him to Byzantium, now called <lb/>
            Constantinople. Lucullus also vanquished his commanders in <lb/>
            a sea-fight. Thus, in a single winter and summer, almost a <lb/>
            hundred thousand men on the king's side were cut off by <lb/>
            Lucullus.</p>
          <p>VII. In the six hundred and seventy-eighth year of Rome, <lb/>
            Marcus Licinius Lucullus, the cousin of that Lucullus who <lb/>
            had carried on the war against Mithridates, obtained the <lb/>
            province of Macedonia. A new war, too, suddenly sprung up in <lb/>
            Italy; for eighty-four gladiators, led by Spartacus. Crixus, and <lb/>
            Œnomaus, having broken out of a school at Capua, made <lb/>
            their escape; and, wandering over Italy, kindled a war in it, <lb/>
            not much less serious than that which Hannibal had raised; <lb/>
            for, after defeating several generals and two consuls of the <lb/>
            Romans, they collected an army of nearly sixty thousand men. <lb/>
            They were, however, defeated in Apulia by the proconsul <lb/>
            Marcus Licinius Crassus; and, after much calamity to Italy, <lb/>
            the war was terminated in its third year.</p>
          <p>VIII. In the six hundred and eighty-first year from the <lb/>
            founding of the city, in the consulate of Publius Cornelius <lb/>
            Lentulus and Cnæus Aufidius Orestes, there were but two <lb/>
            wars of any importance throughout the Roman empire, the <lb/>
            Mithridatic and the Macedonian. Of these the two Luculli, <lb/>
            Lucius and Marcus, had the direction. Lucius Lucullus, after <lb/>
            the battle at Cyzicus, in which he had conquered Mithridates, <lb/>
            and the sea-fight, in which he had overcome his generals, <lb/>
            pursued him; and, recovering Paphlagonia and Bithynia, <lb/>
            invaded his very kingdom. He took Sinope and Amisus, two <lb/>
            most eminent cities of Pontus. In a second battle, near the <lb/>
            city Cabira, where Mithridates had assembled a vast army <lb/>
            from all parts of his kingdom, thirty thousand of the king's <lb/>
            chosen troops were cut in pieces by five thousand of the <lb/>
            Romans, and Mithridates was put to flight and his camp <lb/>
            plundered. Armenia Minor, also, of which he had taken <lb/>
            possession, was wrested from him. Mithridates was, however, <lb/>
            received after his flight by Tigranes, the king of Armenia, <lb/>
            who at that time reigned in great glory; for he had frequently <lb/>
            defeated the Persians, and had made himself master of Meso­ <lb/>
            potamia, Syria, and part of Phoenicia.</p>
          <p>IX Lucullus, therefore, still pursuing his routed enemy, <pb n="491"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="C.XI.]"/> <lb/>
            entered even the kingdom of Tigranes, who ruled over both <lb/>
            the Armenias. Tigranocerta, the most noble city of Armenia, <lb/>
            he succeeded in taking; the king himself, who advanced <lb/>
            against him with six hundred thousand cuirassiers, and a hun­ <lb/>
            dred thousand archers and other troops, he so completely <lb/>
            defeated with a force of only eighteen thousand, that he anni­ <lb/>
            hilated a great part of the Armenians. Marching from thence <lb/>
            to Nisibis, he took that city also, and made the king's brother <lb/>
            prisoner. But as those whom Lucullus had left in Pontus <lb/>
            with part of the army in order to defend the conquered <lb/>
            countries belonging to the Romans, grew negligent and <lb/>
            avaricious in their conduct, they gave Mithridates an oppor­ <lb/>
            tunity of again making an irruption into Pontus, and thus the <lb/>
            war was renewed. While Lucullus, after the reduction of <lb/>
            Nisibis, was preparing for an expedition against the Persians, <lb/>
            a successor was sent out to take his place.</p>
          <p>X. The other Lucullus, who had the management of affairs <lb/>
            in Macedonia, was the first of the Romans that made war upon <lb/>
            the Bessi, defeating them in a great battle on Mount Hæmus; <lb/>
            he reduced the town of Uscudama, which the Bessi inhabited, <lb/>
            on the same day in which he attacked it; he also took Cabyle, <lb/>
            and penetrated as far as the river Danube. He then besieged <lb/>
            several cities lying above Pontus, where he destroyed Apol­ <lb/>
            lonia, Calatis, Parthenopolis, Tomi, Bistros, and Burziaone,* <lb/>
            and, putting an end to the war, returned to Rome. Both the <lb/>
            Luculli however triumphed, but the Lucullus, who had fought <lb/>
            against Mithridates, with the greater glory, because he had <lb/>
            returned victorious over such powerful nations.</p>
          <p>XI. After the Macedonian war was ended, but while that <lb/>
            with Mithridates still continued (which, on the departure of <lb/>
            Lucullus, that king had renewed, collecting all his forces for <lb/>
            the purpose),. the Cretan war arose, and Cæcilius Metellus <lb/>
            being sent to conduct it, secured the whole province, by a suc­ <lb/>
            cession of great battles, within three years, and received the <lb/>
            appellation of Creticus, and a triumph on account of the <lb/>
            island. About this time Libya also, by the will of Apion, the <note type="footnote"> * Burziaonem.] Thus stands the word in the editions of Havercamp, <lb/>

            king of the country, was added to the Roman empire; in it <lb/>
            were the celebrated cities, Berenice, Ptolemais, and Cyreno.</p>
          <p>XII. During these transactions, pirates infested all the <lb/>
            seas, so that navigation, and that alone, was unsafe to the <lb/>
            Romans, who were now victorious throughout the world. The <lb/>
            war against these pirates, therefore, was committed to Cnæus <lb/>
            Pompey, who, with surprising success and celerity, finished it <lb/>
            in the course of a few months. Soon after, the war against <lb/>
            Mithridates and Tigranes was entrusted to him; in the con­ <lb/>
            duct of which, he overcame Mithridates in Armenia Minor in <lb/>
            a battle by night, and plundered his camp, killing at the same <lb/>
            time forty thousand of his troops, while he lost only twenty of <lb/>
            his own men, and two centurions. Mithridates fled with his <lb/>
            wife and two attendants; and not long after, in consequence <lb/>
            of his cruelty to his own family, he was reduced, through a <lb/>
            sedition excited among his soldiers by his son Pharnaces, to <lb/>
            the necessity of putting an end to his existence, and swallowed <lb/>
            poison. Such was the end of Mithridates, a man of singular <lb/>
            energy and ability; his death happened near the Bosporus. <lb/>
            He reigned sixty years, lived seventy-two, and maintained a <lb/>
            war against the Romans for forty.</p>
          <p>XIII. Pompey next made war upon Tigranes, who sur­ <lb/>
            rendered himself, coming to Pompey's camp at sixteen miles <lb/>
            distance from Artaxata; and, throwing himself at his feet, <lb/>
            placed in his hands his diadem, which Pompey returned to <lb/>
            him, and treated him with great respect, but obliged him to <lb/>
            give up part of his dominions and to pay a large sum of <lb/>
            money: Syria, Phœnicia, and Sophene, were taken from him, <lb/>
            and six thousand talents of silver, which he had to pay to the <lb/>
            Roman people because he had raised a war against them <lb/>
            without cause.</p>
          <p>XIV. Pompey soon after made war also upon the Albani;* <lb/>
            and defeated their king Orodes three times; at length, being <lb/>
            prevailed upon by letters and presents, he granted him par­ <lb/>
            don and peace. He also defeated Artoces, king of Iberia,t in <lb/>
            battle, and reduced him to surrender. Armenia Minor he <lb/>
            conferred upon Deiotarus, the king of Galatia, because he had <lb/>
            acted as his ally in the Mithridatic war. To Attalus and <note type="footnote"> * See Justin, xlii. 3. </note><note type="footnote"> t The Iberians are mentioned as a people bordering on the Albas <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="C. XVII.]"/> <lb/>
            Pylæmenes he restored Paphlagonia; and appointed Ari­ <lb/>
            starchus king of the Colchians. Shortly after he subdued the <lb/>
            Itureans and Arabians; and, on entering Syria, rewarded <lb/>
            Seleucia, a city near Antioch, with independence, because it <lb/>
            had not admitted King Tigranes. To the inhabitants of An­ <lb/>
            tioch he restored their hostages. On those of Daphne, being <lb/>
            charmed with the beauty of the spot and the abundance of <lb/>
            water, he bestowed a portion of land, in order that their grove <lb/>
            might be enlarged. Marching from thence to Judea, he took <lb/>
            Jerusalem, the capital, in the third month; twelve thousand <lb/>
            of the Jews being slain, and the rest allowed to surrender on <lb/>
            terms. After these achievements, he returned into Asia, <lb/>
            and put an end to this most tedious war.</p>
          <p>XV. In the consulate of Marcus Tullius Cicero, the orator, <lb/>
            and Caius Antonius, in the six hundred and eighty-ninth year <lb/>
            from the foundation of the city, Lucius Sergius Catiline, a <lb/>
            man of very noble family, but of a most corrupt disposition, <lb/>
            conspired to destroy his country, in conjunction with some <lb/>
            other eminent but desperate characters. He was expelled <lb/>
            from the city by Cicero; his accomplices were apprehended <lb/>
            and strangled in prison; and he himself was defeated and <lb/>
            killed in battle by Antonius, the other consul.</p>
          <p>XVI. In the six hundred and ninetieth year from the <lb/>
            building of the city, in the consulate of Decimus Junius <lb/>
            Silanus and Lucius Muræna, Metellus triumphed on account <lb/>
            of Crete, Pompey for the Piratic and Mithridatic wars. No <lb/>
            triumphal procession was ever equal to this; the sons of <lb/>
            Mithridates, the son of Tigranes, and Aristobulus, king of the <lb/>
            Jews, were led before his car; a vast sum of money, an im­ <lb/>
            mense mass of gold and silver, was carried in front. At this <lb/>
            time there was no war of any importance throughout the <lb/>
            world.</p>
          <p>XVII. In the six hundred and ninety-third year from the <lb/>
            founding of the city, Caius Julius Cæsar, who was afterwards <lb/>
            emperor, was made consul with Lucius Bibulus; and Gaul <lb/>
            and Illyricum, with ten legions, were decreed to him. He <lb/>
            first subdued the Helvetii, who are now called Sequani ;* and <note type="footnote"> * Qui nunc Sequari appellantur.] Between the Sequani and Helvetii <lb/>
            was the lofty mount Jura, according to the description given of their <lb/>
            position by Cæsar, B. G. i. 2. If what Eutropius says is true, the <lb/>
            change of name must have arisen from the intercourse of the two <lb/>
            people. See Cellarius Geog Ant. it 3, 50.—Tzschucke. </note> <pb n="494"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VI."/> <lb/>
            afterwards, by conquering in most formidable wars, pro <lb/>
            ceeded as far as the British ocean. In about nine years he <lb/>
            subdued all that part of Gaul which lies between the Alps, <lb/>
            the river Rhone, the Rhine, and the Ocean, and extends in <lb/>
            circumference nearly three thousand two hundred miles. He <lb/>
            next made war upon the Britons, to whom not even the name <lb/>
            of the Romans was known before his time; and having subdued <lb/>
            them, and received hostages, sentenced them to pay a tribute. <lb/>
            On Gaul, under the name of tribute, he imposed the yearly <lb/>
            sum of forty thousand sestertia;* and invading the Germans <lb/>
            on the other side of the Rhine, defeated them in several most <lb/>
            sanguinary engagements. Among so many successes, he met <lb/>
            with three defeats, once in person among the Arverni, and <lb/>
            twice in Germany during his absence; for two of his lieu­ <lb/>
            tenant generals, Titurius and Aurunculeius, were cut off by <lb/>
            ambuscades.</p>
          <p>XVIII. About the same time, in the six hundred and <lb/>
            ninety-seventh year from the foundation of the city, Marcus <lb/>
            Licinius Crassus, the colleague of Cnaeus Pompey the Great <lb/>
            in his second consulship, was sent against the Parthians; and <lb/>
            having engaged the enemy near Carræ, contrary to the omens <lb/>
            and auspices, was defeated by Surena, the general of king <lb/>
            Orodes, and at last killed, together with his son, a most noble <lb/>
            and excellent young man. The remains of the army were <lb/>
            saved by Caius Cassius the quæstor, who, with singular <lb/>
            courage, so ably retrieved the ruined fortune of the Romans, <lb/>
            that, in his retreat over the Euphrates, he defeated the <lb/>
            Persians in several battles.</p>
          <p>XIX. Soon after followed the Civil war, a war truly exe­ <lb/>
            crable and deplorable, in which, besides the havoc that occurred <lb/>
            in the several battles, the fortune of the Roman people was <lb/>
            changed.! For Cæsar, on returning victorious from Gaul, pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded to demand another consulship, and in such a manner, <lb/>
            that it was granted him without hesitation; yet opposition was <lb/>
            made to it by Marcellus the consul, Bibulus, Pompey, and <lb/>
            Cato, and he was in consequence ordered to disband his army <note type="footnote"> * Something more than £320,000. </note><note type="footnote"> t Romani populi fortuna mutata est.]The fortune of the Roman <lb/>
            people is their condition and state. The phrase fortuna mutari, or <lb/>
            immutari, is used chiefly when the state of things is changed for the <lb/>
            worse. See Call. Cat. c. 2; Jug. c. 17; Vell. Pat. ii. 57, <unclear>118</unclear>.—Grunerus. </note> <pb n="495"/>

            and return to Rome; in revenge for which insult, he marched <lb/>
            with his army from Ariminum, where he kept his forces <lb/>
            assembled, against his country. The consuls, together with <lb/>
            Pompey, the whole senate, and all the nobility, fled from the <lb/>
            city, and crossed over into Greece; and in Epirus, Macedonia, <lb/>
            and Achaia, the senate, under Pompey as their general, pre­ <lb/>
            pared war against Cæsar.</p>
          <p>XX. Cæsar, having marched into the deserted city, made <lb/>
            himself dictator. Soon after he set out for Spain, where he <lb/>
            defeated the armies of Pompey, which were very powerful and <lb/>
            brave, with their three generals, Lucius Afranius, Marcus <lb/>
            Petreius, and Marcus Varro. Returning from thence, he went <lb/>
            over into Greece. He took the field against Pompey, but in <lb/>
            the first battle was defeated and put to flight; he escaped, <lb/>
            however, because Pompey declined to pursue him, as the night <lb/>
            was coming on; when Cæsar remarked, that Pompey knew <lb/>
            not how to conquer, and that that was the only day on which <lb/>
            he himself might have been vanquished. They next fought <lb/>
            at Palaeopharsalus,* in Thessaly, leading great forces into the <lb/>
            field on both sides. The army of Pompey consisted of forty <lb/>
            thousand foot, six hundred horse on the left wing, and five <lb/>
            hundred on the right, besides auxiliary troops from the whole <lb/>
            east, and all the nobility, senators without number, men of <lb/>
            praetorian and consular rank, and some who had already <lb/>
            been conquerors of powerful nations. Cæsar had not quite <lb/>
            thirty thousand infantry in his army, and but one thousand <lb/>
            horse.</p>
          <p>XXI. Never before had a greater number of Roman forces <lb/>
            assembled in one place, or under better generals, forces which <lb/>
            would easily have subdued the whole world, had they been led <lb/>
            against barbarians. They fought with great eagerness, but <lb/>
            Pompey was at last overcome, and his camp plundered. <lb/>
            Pompey himself, when put to flight, sought refuge at Alex­ <lb/>
            andria, with the hope of receiving aid from the king of Egypt, <lb/>
            to whom, on account of his youth, he had been appointed <lb/>
            guardian by the senate; he, however, regarding fortune rather <lb/>
            than friendship, caused Pompey to be killed, and sent his head <lb/>
            and ring to Cæsar; at sight of which even Cæsar is said to <note type="footnote"> * Generally called Pharsalus; but the name Palæopharsalus, that is, <lb/>
            Old Pharsalus, is used by Orosius, vi 15, by Strabo, lib. xvii., and by <lb/>
            the Greek translator of Eutropius. </note> <pb n="496"/>

            have shed tears, as he viewed the head of so great a mail, <lb/>
            once his own son-in law.</p>
          <p>XXII. Cæsar soon after went to Alexandria. Ptolemy <lb/>
            attempted to form a plot against his life also; for which reason <lb/>
            war was made upon him, and, being defeated, he perished in <lb/>
            the Nile, and his body was found covered with a golden coat <lb/>
            of mail. Cæsar, having made himself master of Alexandria, <lb/>
            conferred the kingdom on Cleopatra, the sister of Ptolemy, <lb/>
            with whom he himself had an illicit connexion. On his return <lb/>
            from thence, Cæsar defeated in battle Pharnaces, the son of <lb/>
            Mithridates the Great, who had assisted Pompey in Thessaly, <lb/>
            taken up arms in Pontus, and seized upon several provinces <lb/>
            of the Roman people; and at last drove him to self-destruc­ <lb/>
            tion.</p>
          <p>XXIII. Returning from thence to Rome, he created him­ <lb/>
            self a third time consul with Marcus Æmilius Lepidus, who <lb/>
            had been his master of the horse when dictator the year before. <lb/>
            Next he went into Africa, where a great number of the nobility, <lb/>
            in conjunction with Juba, king of Mauritania, had resumed <lb/>
            hostilities. The Roman leaders were Publius Cornelius Scipio, <lb/>
            of the most ancient family of Scipio Africanus (who had also <lb/>
            been the father-in-law of the great Pompey) Marcus Petreius, <lb/>
            Quintus Varus, Marcus Porcius Cato, and Lucius Cornelius <lb/>
            Faustus, the son of Sylla the dictator. In a pitched battle <lb/>
            fought against them, Cæsar, after many struggles, was victorious. <lb/>
            Cato, Scipio, Petreius, Juba, killed themselves ; Faustus, Pom­ <lb/>
            pey's son-in-law, was slain by Cæsar.</p>
          <p>XXIV. On his return to Rome the year after, Cæsar made <lb/>
            himself a fourth time consul, and immediately proceeded to <lb/>
            Spain, where the sons of Pompey, Cnæus, and Sextus, had <lb/>
            again raised a formidable war. Many engagements took place, <lb/>
            the last near the city of Munda, in which Cæsar was so nearly <lb/>
            defeated, that, upon his forces giving way, he felt inclined to <lb/>
            kill himself, lest, after such great glory in war, he should fall, <lb/>
            at the age of fifty-six, into the hands of young men. At <lb/>
            length, having rallied his troops, he gained the victory; the <lb/>
            elder son of Pompey was slain, the younger fled.</p>
          <p>XXV. The civil wars throughout the world being now <lb/>
            terminated, Cæsar returned to Rome, and began to conduct <lb/>
            himself with too great arrogance, contrary to the usages of <lb/>
            Roman liberty. As he disposed, therefore, at his own pleasure, <pb n="497"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="C. I.]"/> <lb/>
            of those honours, which were before conferred by the people, <lb/>
            and did not even rise up when the senate approached him, and <lb/>
            exercised regal or almost tyrannical power, in other respects, <lb/>
            a conspiracy was formed against him by sixty or more Roman <lb/>

          <p>I. AFTER the assassination of Cæsar, in about the seven <lb/>
            hundred and ninth year of the city, the civil wars were re­ <lb/>
            newed ; for the senate favoured the assassins of Caesar ; and <lb/>
            Antony, the consul, being of Cæsar's party, endeavoured to <lb/>
            crush them in a civil war. The state therefore being thrown <lb/>
            into confusion, Antony, perpetrating many acts of violence, <lb/>
            was declared an enemy by the senate. The two consuls, <lb/>
            Pansa and Hirtius, were sent in pursuit of him, together with <lb/>
            Octavianus, a youth of eighteen years of age, the nephew of <note type="footnote"> K K </note> <pb n="498"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B. VII."/> <lb/>
            Cæsar,* whom by his will he had appointed his heir, directing <lb/>
            him to bear his name; this is the same who was afterwards <lb/>
            called Augustus, and obtained the imperial dignity. These <lb/>
            three generals therefore marching against Antony, defeated him. <lb/>
            It happened, however, that the two victorious consuls lost <lb/>
            their lives; and the three armies in consequence became <lb/>
            subject to Cæsar only.</p>
          <p>11. Antony, being routed, and having lost his army, fled <lb/>
            to Lepidus, who had been master of the horse to Cæsar, and <lb/>
            was at that time in possession of a strong body of forces, by whom <lb/>
            he was well received. By the mediation of Lepidus, Cæsar <lb/>
            shortly after made peace with Antony, and, as if with intent <lb/>
            to avenge the death of his father, by whom he had been adopted <lb/>
            in his will, marched to Rome at the head of an army, and <lb/>
            forcibly procured his appointment to the consulship in his <lb/>
            twentieth year. In conjunction with Antony and Lepidus he <lb/>
            proscribed the senate, and proceeded to make himself master <lb/>
            of the state by arms. By their acts, Cicero the orator, and <lb/>
            many others of the nobility, were put to death.</p>
          <p>III. In the meantime Brutus and Cassius, the assassins <lb/>
            of Cæsar, raised a great war ; for there were several armies <lb/>
            in Macedonia and the East, of which they took the command. <lb/>
            Caesar Octavianus Augustus, therefore, and Mark Antony, <lb/>
            proceeding against them (for Lepidus remained for the <lb/>
            defence of Italy), came to an engagement at Philippi, a city <lb/>
            of Macedonia. In the first battle Antony and Cæsar were <lb/>
            defeated, but Cassius, the leader of the nobility, fell; in the <lb/>
            second they defeated and killed Brutus, and very many of the <lb/>
            nobility who had joined them in the war; and the republic <lb/>
            was divided among the conquerors, so that Augustus had <lb/>
            Spain, the Gauls, and Italy ; Antony, Asia, Pontus, and the <lb/>
            East. But the consul Lucius Antonius, the brother of him who <lb/>
            had fought with Cæsar against Brutus and Cassius, kindled <lb/>
            a civil war in Italy; and being defeated near Perusia, a city <lb/>
            of Tuscany, was taken prisoner, but not put to death.</p>
          <p>IV. In the meantime a war of a serious nature was excited in <lb/>
            Sicily by Sextus Pompey, the son of Cnæus Pompey the Great, <lb/>

            was the daughter of Julia, Julius Cæsar's sister. Thus Julius Cam <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="C. VIII.]"/> <lb/>
            to join him from all parts. The war against Sextus Pompey <lb/>
            was carried on by Caesar Augustus Octavianus and Mark Antony. <lb/>
            A peace was at length concluded.</p>
          <p>V. About that time Marcus Agrippa met with great success <lb/>
            in Aquitania; also Lucius Ventidius Bassus defeated the <lb/>
            Persians, who were making incursions into Syria, in three <lb/>
            engagements. He killed Pacorus, the son of king Orodes, on <lb/>
            that very day on which Orodes, the king of the Persians, had <lb/>
            before put Crassus to death by the hands of his general <lb/>
            Surena. He was the first who celebrated a most legitimate <lb/>
            triumph at Rome over the Parthians.</p>
          <p>VI. In the meantime Sextus Pompey violated the peace, <lb/>
            and, being defeated in a sea-fight, fled to Asia, and was there <lb/>
            put to death.</p>
          <p>Antony, who was master of Asia and the East, having di­ <lb/>
            vorced the sister of Cæsar Augustus Octavianus, married <lb/>
            Cleopatra, queen of Egypt. He also fought in person against <lb/>
            the Persians, and defeated them in the first encounters ; but <lb/>
            on his return suffered greatly from famine and pestilence; <lb/>
            and as the Parthians pressed on him in his retreat, he <lb/>
            retired from before them just as if he had been defeated.</p>
          <p>VII. He also excited a great civil war, at the instigation of <lb/>
            his wife Cleopatra, the queen of Egypt, who aspired with a <lb/>
            womanish ambition to reign at Rome. He was defeated <lb/>
            by Augustus in the remarkable and celebrated sea-fight at <lb/>
            Actium, a place in Epirus; whence he fled into Egypt, and <lb/>
            there, as his circumstances grew desperate, since all went over <lb/>
            to Augustus, committed suicide. Cleopatra applied to her­ <lb/>
            self an asp, and perished by its venom. Egypt was added to <lb/>
            the Roman empire by Octavianus Augustus, and Cnæus <lb/>
            Cornelius Gall us appointed governor of it; he was the first <lb/>
            Roman judge that Egypt had,</p>
          <p>VIII. Having thus brought wars to an end throughout the <lb/>
            world, OCTAVIANUS AUGUSTUS returned to Rome in the twelfth <lb/>
            year after he had been elected consul. From that period be <lb/>
            held the government as sole ruler for forty-four years, for dur­ <lb/>
            ing the twelve previous years he had held it in conjunction with <lb/>
            Antony and Lepidus. Thus from the beginning of his reign <lb/>
            to the end were fifty-six years. He died a natural death in <lb/>
            his eighty-sixth year, at the town of Atella in Campania <lb/>
            lud his remains are interred at Rome in the Campus Martius; <note type="footnote"> K K 2 </note> <pb n="500"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VII"/> <lb/>
            He was a can who was considered in most respects, and not <lb/>
            without reason, to resemble a divinity, for scarcely ever was <lb/>
            there any one more successful than he in war, or more <lb/>
            prudent in peace. During the forty-four years that he <lb/>
            held the government alone, he conducted himself with the <lb/>
            greatest courtesy, being most liberal to all, and most faithful <lb/>
            to his friends, whom he raised to such honours, that he placed <lb/>
            them almost on a level with his own dignity.</p>
          <p>IX. At no period was the Roman state more flourishing ; <lb/>
            for, to say nothing of the civil wars, in which he was uncon­ <lb/>
            quered, he added to the Roman empire Egypt, Cantabria, <lb/>
            Dalmatia, often before conquered but only then entirely sub­ <lb/>
            dued, Pannonia, Aquitania, Illyricum, Rhætia, the Viudelici <lb/>
            and Salassi on the Alps, and all the maritime cities of Pontus, <lb/>
            among which the two most noble were Bosporus and Pantica­ <lb/>
            pæon. He also conquered the Dacians in battle; put to the <lb/>
            sword numerous forces of the Germans; and drove them <lb/>
            beyond the river Elbe, which is in the country of the <lb/>
            barbarians far beyond the Rhine. This war however he <lb/>
            carried on by the agency of his step-son Drusus, as he had <lb/>
            conducted the Pannonian war by that of his other step-son <lb/>
            Tiberius, in which he transplanted forty thousand prisoners <lb/>
            from Germany, and settled them in Gaul on the bank of the <lb/>
            Rhine. He recovered Armenia from the Parthians; the <lb/>
            Persians gave him hostages, which they had given to no one <lb/>
            before; and also restored the Roman standards, which the) <lb/>
            had taken from Crassus when he was defeated.</p>
          <p>X. The Scythians and Indians, to whom the Roman name <lb/>
            was before unknown, sent him presents and ambassadors. <lb/>
            Galatia also was made a province under his reign, having <lb/>
            before been an independent kingdom, and Marcus Lollius was <lb/>
            the first that governed it, in quality of prætor. So much <lb/>
            was he beloved even by the barbarians, that kings, allies of <lb/>
            the Roman people, founded cities in his honour, to which they <lb/>
            gave the name of Cæsarea, as one in Mauritania, built by <lb/>
            King Juba, and another in Palestine, which is now a very <lb/>
            celebrated city. Many kings, moreover, left their own domi­ <lb/>
            nions, and, assuming the Roman dress, that is, the toga, ran <lb/>
            by the side of his carriage or his horse. At his death he was <lb/>
            styled a divinity. He left the state in a most prosperous <lb/>
            condition to his successor Tiberius, who had been his step-son, <lb/>
            afterwards his son in-law, and lastly his son by adoption.</p><pb n="501"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="- XIII.]"/> XI. TIBERIUS distinguished his reign by great indolence, <lb/>
            excessive cruelty, unprincipled avarice, and abandoned licen­ <lb/>
            tiousness. He fought on no occasion in person; the wars were <lb/>
            carried on by his generals. Some kings, whom he induced to <lb/>
            visit him by seducing allurements, he never sent back; among <lb/>
            them was Archelaus of Cappadocia, whose kingdom also he <lb/>
            reduced to the form of a province, and directed that its princi­ <lb/>
            pal city should be called after his own name; and, having been <lb/>
            before called Mazaca, it is now termed Cæsarea. He died in <lb/>
            Campania, in the three and twentieth year of his reign, and <lb/>
            the eighty-third of his age, to the great joy of all men.</p>
          <p>XII. To him succeeded CAIUS CÆSAR, surnamed CALIGULA, <lb/>
            the grandson of Drusus, the step-son of Augustus, and grand- <lb/>
            nephew * of Tiberius himself, a most wicked and cruel prince. <lb/>
            who effaced even the memory of Tiberius's enormities. He <lb/>
            undertook a war against the Germans; but, after entering <lb/>
            Suevia, made no effort to do anything. He committed incest <lb/>
            with his sisters, and acknowledged a daughter that he had by <lb/>
            one of them. While tyrannizing over all with the utmost <lb/>
            avarice, licentiousness, and cruelty, he was assassinated in the <lb/>
            palace, in the twenty-ninth year of his age, in the third year, <lb/>
            tenth month, and eighth day of his reign.</p>
          <p>XIII. After him reigned CLAUDIUS, the uncle of Caligula, <lb/>
            and son of that Drusus who has a monument at Moguntiacum, <lb/>
            whose grandson Caligula also was. His reign was of no <lb/>
            striking character; he acted, in many respects, with gentleness <lb/>
            and moderation, in some with cruelty and folly. He made <lb/>
            war upon Britain, which no Roman since Julius Cæsar had <lb/>
            visited ; and, having reduced it through the agency of Cnaeus <lb/>
            Sentius and Aulus Plautius, illustrious and noble men, he <lb/>
            celebrated a magnificent triumph. Certain islands also, called <lb/>
            the Orcades, situated in the ocean, beyond Britain, he added <lb/>
            to the Roman empire, and gave his son the name of Britan­ <lb/>
            nicus. So condescending, too, was he towards some of his <lb/>
            friends, that he even attended Plautius, a man of noble birth, <lb/>
            who had obtained many signal successes in the expedition <lb/>
            to Britain, in his triumph, and walked at his left hand when <note type="footnote"> * Drusi privogni Augusti, et ipsius Tiberii nepos.] Either something <lb/>

            he went up to the Capitol. He lived to the age of sixty-four, <lb/>
            and reigned fourteen years; and after his death was conse­ <lb/>
            crated* and deified.</p>
          <p>To him succeeded NERO, who greatly resembled his uncle <lb/>
            Caligula, and both disgraced and weakened the Roman empire; <lb/>
            he indulged in such extraordinary luxury and extravagance, <lb/>
            that, after the example of Caius Caligula, he even bathed in hot <lb/>
            and cold perfumes, and fished with golden nets, which he drew <lb/>
            up with cords of purple silk. He put to death a very great <lb/>
            number of the senate. To all good men he was an enemy, <lb/>
            At last he exposed himself in so disgraceful a manner, that he <lb/>
            danced and sung upon the stage in the dress of a harp-player <lb/>
            and tragedian. He was guilty of many murders, his brother, <lb/>
            wife, and mother, being put to death by him. He set on fire <lb/>
            the city of Rome, that he might enjoy the sight of a spectacle <lb/>
            such as Troy formerly presented when, taken and burned.</p>
          <p>In military affairs he attempted nothing, Britain he <lb/>
            almost lost; for two of its most noble towns † were taken and <lb/>
            levelled to the ground under his reign. The Parthians took <lb/>
            from him Armenia, and compelled the Roman legions to pass <lb/>
            under the yoke. Two provinces however were formed under <lb/>
            him; Pontus Polemoniacus, by the concession of King Pole­ <lb/>
            mon; and the Cottian Alps, on the death of King Cottius.</p>
          <p>XV. When, having become detestable by such conduct to <lb/>
            the city of Rome, and being deserted at the same time by <lb/>
            every one, and declared an enemy by the senate, he was <lb/>
            sought for to be led to punishment (the punishment being, <lb/>

          <p>XVI. To Nero succeeded SERVIUS GALBA, a senator of a very <lb/>
            ancient and noble family, elected emperor when in his seventy- <lb/>
            third year by the Spaniards and Gauls, and soon after readily <lb/>
            acknowledged by the whole army; for his life, though but that <lb/>
            of a private person,. had been distinguished by many military <lb/>
            and civil exploits, having been often consul, often proconsul, <lb/>
            and frequently general in most important wars. His reign was <lb/>
            short, but had a promising commencement, except that he <lb/>
            seemed to incline too much to severity. He was killed how <lb/>
            ever by the treachery of Otho, in the seventh month of his <lb/>
            reign, in the forum at Rome, and buried in his gardens, which <lb/>
            are situated in the Aurelian way, not far from the city.</p>
          <p>XVII. OTHO, after Galba was killed, took possession of the <lb/>
            government, a man of a nobler descent on the mother's than the <lb/>
            father's side, but obscure on neither. In private life he was <lb/>
            effeminate, and an intimate of Nero; in his government he <lb/>
            could give no evidence of his disposition ; for Vitellius, about <lb/>
            the same time that Otho had slain Galba, having been also <lb/>
            chosen emperor by the German armies, Otho, having <lb/>
            commenced a war against him, and having sustained a defeat <lb/>
            in a slight skirmish near Bebriacum in Italy, voluntarily, <lb/>
            though he had still powerful forces remaining, put an end to his <lb/>
            life, in spite of the entreaties of his soldiers that he would not <lb/>
            so soon despair of the issue of the war; saying, " that he was <lb/>
            not of sufficient importance that a civil war should be raised on <note type="footnote"> fancies that it may be explained by hypallage, for capite ƒurcœ inserto, <lb/>

            eighth year of his age, and on the ninety-fifth day of his reign.</p>
          <p>XVIII. VITELLIUS next obtained the imperial dignity, of a <lb/>
            family rather honourable than noble, for his father was not of <lb/>
            very high birth, though he had filled three regular consulships. <lb/>
            He reigned most disgracefully, being distinguished by the <lb/>
            greatest cruelty, but especially by gluttony and voraciousness, <lb/>
            since he is reported to have often feasted four or five times a <lb/>
            day. A most remarkable supper at least has been recorded, <lb/>
            which his brother Vitellius set before him, and in which, <lb/>
            besides other expensive dainties, two thousand fishes and seven <lb/>
            thousand birds are said to have been placed on the table.</p>
          <p>Being anxious to resemble Nero, and aiming so openly at <lb/>
            this that he even paid respect to his remains, which had been <lb/>
            meanly buried, he was slain by the generals of the emperor <lb/>
            Vespasian, Vitellius having previously put to death Sabinus, <lb/>
            Vespasian's brother, and burned his corpse at the same time <lb/>
            with the Capitol. When killed, he was dragged naked, with <lb/>
            great ignominy, through the public streets of the city, with his <lb/>
            hair erect, and his head raised by means of a sword placed <lb/>
            under his chin, and pelted with dung on the face and breast by <lb/>
            all that came in the way; at last his throat was cut, and he <lb/>
            was thrown into the Tiber, and had not even the common <lb/>
            rites of burial. He perished in the fifty-seventh year of his <lb/>
            age, in the eighth month and first day of his reign.</p>
          <p>XIX. To him succeeded VESPASIAN, who had been chosen <lb/>
            emperor in Palestine, a prince indeed of obscure birth, but <lb/>
            worthy to be compared with the best emperors, and in private <lb/>
            life - greatly distinguished, as he had been sent by Claudius <lb/>
            into Germany, and afterwards into Britain, and had contended <lb/>
            two and thirty times with the enemy; he had also added to <lb/>
            the Roman empire two very powerful nations, † twenty towns, <lb/>
            and the Isle of Wight on the coast of Britain. At Rome lie <lb/>
            acted with the greatest forbearance during his government; <lb/>
            though he was rather too eager after money; not however that <lb/>
            he deprived any one of it unjustly, and even when he had <note type="footnote"> * Privata vita.] See note on c. 16. </note><note type="footnote"> t Duas validissimas gentes.] The Greek translator thinks that the <lb/>
            Britains and Germans are meant. Vespasian is said to have recovered <lb/>
            Britain, by Tacitus, Agric. c. 17. What other nation is intended is not <lb/>

            collected it with the greatest diligence and anxiety, he was in <lb/>
            the habit of distributing it most readily, especially to the <lb/>
            indigent; nor was the liberality of any prince before him <lb/>
            greater or more judicious: he was also of a most mild and <lb/>
            amiable disposition, insomuch that he never willingly inflicted <lb/>
            a severer penalty than banishment, even on persons convicted <lb/>
            of treason against himself.</p>
          <p>Under this prince Judæa was added to the Roman empire, <lb/>
            and Jerusalem, the most celebrated city of Palestine. He also <lb/>
            reduced to the form of provinces Achaia, Lycia, Rhodes, <lb/>
            Byzantium, Samos, which had been free till this period; <lb/>
            together with Thrace, Cilicia, and Comagena, which had been <lb/>
            governed by their respective kings in alliance with the <lb/>
            Romans.</p>
          <p>XX. Offences and animosities he never bore in mind; <lb/>
            reproaches uttered against himself by lawyers and philosophers <lb/>
            he bore with indulgence, but was a strenuous enforcer of <lb/>
            military discipline. He triumphed, together with his SOil <lb/>
            Titus, on account of the taking of Jerusalem.</p>
          <p>After having thus become an object of love and favour with <lb/>
            the senate and the people, and indeed with all men, he died of <lb/>
            a diarrhoea, in his own villa in the Sabine country, in the sixty- <lb/>
            ninth year of his age, the ninth year and seventh day of his <lb/>
            reign; and was enrolled among the gods.</p>
          <p>To him succeeded his son TITUS, who was also called <lb/>
            Vespasian, a man remarkable for every species of virtue, so <lb/>
            that he was styled the favourite and delight of mankind. He <lb/>
            was extremely eloquent, warlike, and temperate; he pleaded <lb/>
            causes in Latin, and composed poems and tragedies in Greek. <lb/>
            At the siege of Jerusalem, while serving under his father, he <lb/>
            killed twelve of the besieged with wounds from as many <lb/>
            arrows. During his government at Rome, such was his lenity <lb/>
            towards the citizens, that he did not punish a single person ; <lb/>
            and even some that were convicted of a conspiracy against <lb/>
            himself he released, and treated them on the same terms of <lb/>
            intimacy as before. Such was his good-nature and generosity, <lb/>
            that he never refused any thing to any one, and being blamed <lb/>
            by his friends on this account, replied, that no one ought to <lb/>
            leave an emperor in discontent. Hence, having recollected <lb/>
            once at supper, that he had conferred no obligation on any one <lb/>
            that day, he exclaimed : " 0, my friends! I ha ve lost this day I" <pb n="506"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B. VII."/> <lb/>
            He bulk an amphitheatre at Home, and slaughtered five <lb/>
            thousand wild beasts at the dedication of it.</p>
          <p>XXII. While beloved for such conduct, with extraordinary <lb/>
            affection, he fell ill and died in the same villa as his father, two <lb/>
            years, eight months, and twenty days after he became emperor, <lb/>
            and in the forty-second year of his age. So great was the <lb/>
            public lamentation on his death, that all mourned as for a loss <lb/>
            in their own families. The senate, having received intelligence <lb/>
            of his death about the evening, hurried into the senate-house in <lb/>
            the night, and heaped upon him after his death even more <lb/>
            expressions of good will and commendation, than they had <lb/>
            uttered when he was alive and present among them. He was <lb/>
            enrolled among the gods.</p>
          <p>XXIII. DOMITIAN next received the imperial dignity, the <lb/>
            younger brother of Titus, but more like Nero, or Caligula, or <lb/>
            Tiberius, than his father or brother. In the commencement <lb/>
            however of his reign he used his power with moderation; but, <lb/>
            soon proceeding to the greatest excesses of licentiousness, rage, <lb/>
            cruelty, and avarice, he provoked such universal detestation, <lb/>
            that he effaced the remembrance of his father's and his <lb/>
            brother's merits. He put to death the most distinguished of <lb/>
            the senate. He was the first that required to be addressed as <lb/>
            Lord and God; and he suffered no statue to be erected to him <lb/>
            in the Capitol except of gold or silver. He put his own <lb/>
            cousins to death. His pride also was execrable.</p>
          <p>He made four expeditions, one against the Sarmatians, <lb/>
            another against the Catti, and two against the Dacians. <lb/>
            On account of the Dacians and the Catti he celebrated a <lb/>
            double triumph; for the Sarmatians, he assumed only the <lb/>
            laurel. He suffered many disasters however in these wars, for <lb/>
            in Sarmatia one of his legions was cut off together with its <lb/>
            captain, and by the Dacians Oppius Sabinus, a person of <lb/>
            consular dignity, and Cornelius Fuscus, the prefect of the <lb/>
            praetorian cohort, were slain, with numerous armies. At Rome <lb/>
            he also erected several public buildings, among which were the <lb/>
            Capitol, the Forum Transitorium, the Odeum, the Porticus <lb/>
            Divorum, the temples of Isis and Serapis, and the Stadium.</p>
          <p>But, becoming universally odious on account of his crimes, <lb/>
            he was put to death by a conspiracy of his own servants within <lb/>
            the palace, in the forty-fifth year of his age, and the fifteenth of <lb/>
            his reign. His corpse was carried out with extreme insult by <lb/>
            common bearers, and buried ignominiously.</p><pb n="507"/>

            of the city, in the consulship of Vetus and Valens, the empire <lb/>
            was restored to a most prosperous condition, being committed, <lb/>
            with great good fortune, to the rule of meritorious princes. <lb/>
            To Domitian, a most murderous tyrant, succeeded NERVA, a <lb/>
            man of moderation and activity in private life, and of noble <lb/>
            descent, though not of the very highest rank. He was made <lb/>
            emperor at an advanced age, Petronius Secundus, the prefect <lb/>
            of the praetorian guards, and Parthenius, one of the assassins of <lb/>
            Domitian, giving him their support, and conducted himself <lb/>
            with great justice and public spirit.. He provided for the <lb/>
            good of the state by a divine foresight, in his adoption of <lb/>
            Trajan. He died at Rome, after a reign of one year, four <lb/>
            months, and eight days, in the seventy-second year of his age, <lb/>
            and was enrolled among the gods.</p>
          <p>II. To him succeeded ULPIUS CRINITUS TRAJANUS, born at <note type="footnote"> <unclear/> Se civilissimum prœbuit.] Civilis, applied to a person, properly sig­ <lb/>

            Civilitas has two senses; one derived from this sense of civilis, and the <lb/>

            Italica * in Spain, of a family rather ancient than eminent <lb/>
            for his father was the first consul in it. He was chosen <lb/>
            emperor at Agrippina, a city of Gaul. He exercised the <lb/>
            government in such a manner, that he is deservedly preferred <lb/>
            to all the other emperors. He was a man of extraordinary <lb/>
            skill in managing affairs of state, and of remarkable <lb/>
            courage. The limits of the Roman empire, which, since the <lb/>
            reign of Augustus, had been rather defended than honourably <lb/>
            enlarged, he extended far and wide. He rebuilt some cities <lb/>
            in Germany; he subdued Dacia by the overthrow of Decebalus, <lb/>
            and formed a province beyond the Danube, in that territory <lb/>
            which the Thaiphali, Victoali, and Theruingi now occupy. <lb/>
            This province was a thousand miles in circumference.</p>
          <p>III. He recovered Armenia, which the Parthians had seized, <lb/>
            putting to death Parthamasires who held the government of it. <lb/>
            He gave a king to the Albani. He received into alliance the <lb/>
            king of the Iberians, Sarmatians, Bosporani, Arabians, Os­ <lb/>
            droeni, and Colchians. He obtained the mastery over the <lb/>
            Cordueni and Marcomedi, as well as over Anthemusia, an <lb/>
            extensive region of Persia. He conquered and kept possession <lb/>
            of Seleucia, Ctesiphon, Babylon, and the country of the Mes­ <lb/>
            senii. He advanced as far as the boundaries of India, and <lb/>
            the Red Sea, where he formed three provinces, Armenia, <lb/>
            Assyria, and Mesopotamia, including the tribes which border on <lb/>
            Madena.t He afterwards, too, reduced Arabia into the form <lb/>
            of a province. He also fitted out a fleet for the Red Sea, that <lb/>
            he might use it to lay waste the coasts of India.</p>
          <p>IV. Yet he went beyond his glory in war, in ability and <lb/>
            judgment as a ruler, conducting himself as an equal towards <lb/>
            all, going often to his friends as a visitor,‡ either when they were <lb/>
            ill, or when they were celebrating feast days, and entertaining <lb/>
            them in his turn at banquets where there was no distinction of <lb/>
            rank, and sitting frequently with them in their chariots; doing <lb/>
            nothing unjust towards any of the senators, nor being guilty of <note type="footnote"> * A town on the Bætis or Guadalquivir, not far from Seville. It <lb/>

            any dishonesty to fill his treasury; exercising liberality to all, <lb/>
            enriching with offices of trust, publicly and privately, every <lb/>
            body whom he had known even with the least familiarity; <lb/>
            building towns throughout the world, granting many immu­ <lb/>
            nities to states, and doing every thing with gentleness and <lb/>
            kindness; so that during his whole reign, there was but one <lb/>
            senator condemned, and he was sentenced by the senate <lb/>
            without Trajan's knowledge. Hence, being regarded through­ <lb/>
            out the world as next to a god, he deservedly obtained the <lb/>
            highest veneration both living and dead.</p>
          <p>V. Among other sayings of his, the following remarkable <lb/>
            one is mentioned. When his friends found fault with him, <lb/>
            for being too courteous to every body, he replied, that " he <lb/>
            was such an emperor to his subjects, as he had wished, when a <lb/>
            subject, that emperors should be to him."</p>
          <p>After having gained the greatest glory both in the field and <lb/>
            at home, he was cut off, as he was returning from Persia, by a <lb/>
            diarrhoea, at Seleucia in Isauria. He died in the sixty-third <lb/>
            year, ninth month, and fourth day of his age, and in the <lb/>
            nineteenth year. sixth month, and fifteenth day of his <lb/>
            reign. He was enrolled among the gods, and was the only one <lb/>
            of all the emperors that was buried within the city. His bones, <lb/>
            contained in a golden urn, lie in the forum which he himself <lb/>
            built, under a pillar whose height is a hundred and forty-four <lb/>
            feet. So much respect has been paid to his memory, that, <lb/>
            even to our own times, they shout in acclamations to the em­ <lb/>
            perors, " More fortunate than Augustus, better than Trajan! " <lb/>
            So much has the fame of his goodness prevailed, that it affords <lb/>
            ground for most noble illustration in the hands either of such <lb/>
            as flatter, or of such as praise with sincerity.</p>
          <p>VI. After the death of Trajan, ÆLIUS HADRIAN was <lb/>
            made emperor, not from any wish to that effect having been <lb/>
            expressed by Trojan himself, but through the influence of <lb/>
            Plotina, Trajan's wife; for Trajan in his life-time had refused <lb/>
            to adopt him, though he was the son of his cousin.* He also <lb/>
            was born at Italica in Spain. Envying Trajan's glory, he im­ <lb/>
            mediately gave up three of the provinces which Trajan had <lb/>
            added to the empire, withdrawing the armies from Assyria, <lb/>
            Mesopotamia, and Armenia, and deciding that the Euphrates <lb/>
            should be the boundary of the empire. When he was pro­ <lb/>

            ceeding to act similarly with regard to Dacia, his friends <lb/>
            dissuaded him, lest many Roman citizens should be left in <lb/>
            the hands of the barbarians, because Trajan, after he had sub­ <lb/>
            dued Dacia, had transplanted thither an infinite number of <lb/>
            men from the whole Roman world, to people the country and <lb/>
            the cities; as the land had been exhausted of inhabitants in <lb/>
            the long war maintained by Decebalus.</p>
          <p>VII. He enjoyed peace, however, through the whole course <lb/>
            of his reign; the only war that he had, he committed to the <lb/>
            conduct of a governor, of a province. He went about through <lb/>
            the Roman empire, and founded many edifices. He spoke <lb/>
            with great eloquence in the Latin language, and was very <lb/>
            learned in the Greek. He had no great reputation for cle <lb/>
            mency, but was very attentive to the state of the treasury and <lb/>
            the discipline of the soldiers. He died in Compania, more <lb/>
            than sixty years old, in the twenty-first year, tenth month, <lb/>
            and twenty-ninth day of his reign. The senate was unwilling <lb/>
            to allow him divine honours; but his successor Titus Aurelius <lb/>
            Fulvius Antonius, earnestly insisting on it, carried his point, <lb/>
            though all the senators were openly opposed to him.</p>
          <p>VIII. To Hadrian, then, succeeded TITUS ANTONINUS FUL­ <lb/>
            VIUS BOIONIUS,*who was also named Pius, sprung from an <lb/>
            eminent, though not very ancient, family; a man of high cha. <lb/>
            racter, who may justly be compared to Numa Pompilius, as <lb/>
            Trajan may be paralleled with Romulus. He lived, before he <lb/>
            came to the throne, in great honour, but in greater still <lb/>
            during his reign. He was cruel to none, but indulgent to all. <lb/>
            His reputation in military affairs was but moderate; he <lb/>
            studied rather to defend the provinces than to enlarge them. <lb/>
            He sought out the most just men to fill political offices. He <lb/>
            paid respect to the good; for the bad he showed dislike, <lb/>
            without treating them with harshness. By kings in alliance <lb/>
            with Rome he was not less venerated than feared, so that <lb/>
            many nations among the barbarians, laying aside their arms, <lb/>
            referred their controversies and disputes to him, and sub <lb/>
            fitted to his decision. He was very rich before he began to <lb/>
            reign, but diminished his wealth by pay to the soldiers and <note type="footnote"> * Boionius. This name is supposed by Casaubon ad Capitolin. Vit. <lb/>

            He died at his country seat called Lorium, twelve miles from <lb/>
            the city, in the seventy-third year of his age, and the twenty- <lb/>
            third of his reign. He was enrolled among the gods, and <lb/>
            was deservedly an object of veneration.-</p>
          <p>IX. After him reigned MARCUS ANTONINUS VERUS, a man <lb/>
            indisputably of noble birth; for his descent, on the father's <lb/>
            side, was from Numa Pompilius, and on the mother's from a <lb/>
            king of the Sallentines,† and jointly with him reigned Lucius <lb/>
            ANTONINUS VERUS. Then it was that the commonwealth of <lb/>
            Rome was first subject to two sovereigns, ruling with equal <lb/>
            power, when, till their days, it had always had but one <lb/>
            emperor at a time.</p>
          <p>X. These two were connected both by relationship ‡ and <lb/>
            affinity; for Verus Antoninus had married the daughter of <lb/>
            Marcus Antoninus; and Marcus Antoninus was the son-in- <lb/>
            law of Antoninus Pius, having married Galeria Faustina the <lb/>
            younger, his own cousin. They carried on a war against the <lb/>
            Parthians, who then rebelled for the first time since their sub­ <lb/>
            jugation by Trajan. Verus Antoninus went out to conduct <lb/>
            that war, and, remaining at Antioch and about Armenia, <lb/>
            effected many important achievements by the agency of his <lb/>
            generals: he took Seleucia, the most eminent city of Assyria. <lb/>
            with forty thousand prisoners; he brought off materials for a <lb/>
            triumph over the Parthians, and celebrated it in conjunction <lb/>
            with his brother, who was also his father-in-law. He died in <lb/>

            which took place in the eleventh year of his reign, he was <lb/>
            enrolled among the gods.</p>
          <p>XI. After him MARCUS ANTONINUS held the government <lb/>
            alone, a man whom any one may more easily admire than <lb/>
            sufficiently commend. He was, from his earliest years, of a <lb/>
            most tranquil disposition; so that even in his infancy be <lb/>
            changed countenance neither for joy nor for sorrow. He was <lb/>
            dovoted to the Stoic philosophy, and was himself a philosopher, <lb/>
            not only in his way of life, but in learning. He was the <lb/>
            object of so much admiration, while yet a youth, that Hadrian <lb/>
            intended to make him his successor; but having adopted Titus <lb/>
            Antoninus Pius, he wished Marcus to become Titus's son-in- <lb/>
            law, tnat he might by that means come to the throne.</p>
          <p>XII. He was trained in philosophy by Apollonius of Chal­ <lb/>
            cedon; in the study of the Greek language by Sextus of <lb/>
            Chæronea, the grandson of Plutarch; while the eminent <lb/>
            orator Fronto instructed him in Latin literature. He con­ <lb/>
            ducted himself towards all men at Rome as if he had been <lb/>
            their equal, being moved to no arrogance by his elevation to <lb/>
            empire. He exercised the most prompt liberality, and <lb/>
            managed the provinces with the utmost kindness and indul­ <lb/>
            gence. Under his rule affairs were successfully conducted <lb/>
            against the Germans. He himself carried on one war with <lb/>
            the Marcomanni, but this was greater than any in the <lb/>
            memory of man,* so that it is compared to the Punic wars; <lb/>
            for it became so much the more formidable, as whole armies <lb/>
            had been lost; since, under the emperor, after the victory <lb/>
            over the Parthians,† there occurred so destructive a pestilence, <lb/>
            that at Rome, and throughout Italy and the provinces, the <lb/>
            greater part of the inhabitants, and almost all the troops, sunk <lb/>
            under the disease.</p>

            Quadi, Vandals, Sarmatians, Suevi, and all the barbarians in <lb/>
            that quarter, had joined with the Marcomanni in raising; <lb/>
            he killed several thousand men, and, having delivered the <lb/>
            Pannonians from slavery, triumphed a second time at Rome <lb/>
            with his son Commodus Antoninus, whom he had previously <lb/>
            made Caesar, † As he had no money to give his soldiers, in <lb/>
            consequence of the treasury having been exhausted for the <lb/>
            support of the war, and as he was unwilling to lay any tax on <lb/>
            the provinces or the senate, he sold off all his imperial furniture <lb/>
            and decorations, by an auction held in the forum of the em­ <lb/>
            peror Trajan, consisting of vessels of gold, cups of crystal and <lb/>
            murrha,‡ silk garments belonging to his wife and himself, <lb/>
            embroidered with gold, and numbers of jewelled ornaments. <lb/>
            This sale was continued through two successive months, and a <lb/>
            great quantity of money was raised from it. After his victory, <lb/>
            however, he gave back the money to such of the purchasers as <lb/>
            were willing to restore what they had bought, but was by n <unclear/> <lb/>
            means troublesome to any one who preferred to keep their <lb/>
            purchases.</p>
          <p>XIV. He allowed the more eminent men to give entertain­ <lb/>
            ments with the same magnificence, and the same number of <lb/>
            attendants, as himself. In the display of games after his <lb/>
            victory, he was so munificent, that he is said to have exhibited <lb/>
            a hundred lions at once. Having, then, rendered the state <lb/>
            happy, both by his excellent management and gentleness of <lb/>
            disposition, he died in the eighteenth year of his reign and <lb/>
            the sixty-first of his life, and was enrolled among the gods, all <lb/>
            unanimously voting that such honour should be paid him.</p>
          <p>XV. His successor, Lucius ANTONINUS COMMODUS, had no <lb/>
            resemblance to his father, except that he fought successfully <lb/>
            against the Germans. He endeavoured to alter the name of <note type="footnote"> * A town in Upper Pannonia, on the Danube, where Haimburg or <lb/>

            licentiousness. He often fought, with gladiator's arms, in the <lb/>
            fencing school, and afterwards with men of that class in the <lb/>
            amphitheatre. He died so sudden a death, that he was <lb/>
            thought to have been strangled or despatched by poison, after <lb/>
            he had reigned twelve years and eight months after his father, <lb/>
            and in the midst of such execration from all men, that even <lb/>
            after his death he was styled " the enemy of the human race."</p>
          <p>XVI. To him succeeded PERTlNAX, at a very advanced age, <lb/>
            having reached his seventieth year; he was appointed to be <lb/>
            emperor by a decree of the senate, when he was holding the <lb/>
            office of præfect of the city. He was killed in a mutiny <lb/>
            of the praetorian soldiers, by the villany of Julianus, on the <lb/>
            eightieth day of his reign.</p>
          <p>XVII. After his death SALVIUS JULIANUS seized the govern­ <lb/>
            ment, a man of noble birth, and eminently skilled in the law; <lb/>
            he was the grandson of that Salvius Julianus who composed <lb/>
            the perpetual edict * in the reign of the emperor Adrian. He <lb/>
            was defeated by Severus at the Milvian bridge, and killed in <lb/>
            the palace. He lived only eight months after he began to reign.</p>
          <p>XVIII. SEPTIMIUS SEVERUS then assumed the government <lb/>
            of the Roman empire; a native of Africa, born in the province <lb/>
            of Tripolis, and town of Leptis. He was the only African, in <lb/>
            all the time before or after him, that became emperor. He <lb/>
            was first præfect of the treasury, afterwards military tribune, <lb/>
            and then rose, through several offices and posts of honour, to <lb/>
            the government of the whole state. He had an inclination to <lb/>
            be called Pertinax, in honour of that Pertinax who had been <lb/>
            killed by Julian. He was very parsimonious, and naturally <lb/>
            cruel. He conducted many wars, and with success. He <lb/>
            killed Pescennius Niger, who had raised a rebellion in Egypt <lb/>
            and Syria, at Cyzicus. He overcame the Parthians, the in­ <lb/>
            terior Arabians, and the Adiabeni. The Arabians he so <note type="footnote"> * He wished, as Tzschucke observes, to have the month of August <lb/>

            as to the method in which he intended to administer justice for his <lb/>

            perpetual edict a uniform course of proceed in was laid down. See <lb/>

            effectually reduced, that he made them a province ; hence he <lb/>
            was called Parthicus, Arabicus, and Adiabenicus. He rebuilt <lb/>
            many edifices throughout the whole Roman world. In his <lb/>
            reign, too, Clodius Albinus, who had been an accomplice of <lb/>
            Julianus in killing Pertinax, set himself up for Cæsar in Gaul, <lb/>
            and was overthrown and killed at Lyons.</p>
          <p>XIX. Severus, in addition to his glory in war, was also dis­ <lb/>
            tinguished in the pursuits of peace, being not only accomplished <lb/>
            in literature, but having acquired a complete knowledge of <lb/>
            philosophy. The last war that he had was in Britain; and <lb/>
            that he might preserve, with all possible security, the provinces <lb/>
            which he had acquired, he built a rampart of thirty-two miles <lb/>
            long from one sea to the other. He died at an advanced age <lb/>
            at York, in the eighteenth year and fourth month of his reign, <lb/>
            and was honoured with the title of god. He left his two sons, <lb/>
            Bassianus and Gets, to be his successors, but desired that the <lb/>
            name of Antoninus should be given by the senate to Bassi­ <lb/>
            anus only, who, accordingly, was named Marcus Aurelius An­ <lb/>
            toninus Bassianus, and was his father's successor. As for <lb/>
            Gets., he was declared a public enemy, and soon after put to <lb/>
            death.</p>
          <p>XX. MARCUS AURELIUS ANTONINUS BASSIANUS, then, who <lb/>
            was also called CARACALLA, was a man very much of his <lb/>
            father's disposition, but somewhat more rough and vindictive. <lb/>
            He erected a bath of excellent construction at Rome, which is <lb/>
            called the bath of Antoninus,* but did nothing else worthy of <lb/>
            record. He wanted ability to control his passions ; for he <lb/>
            married his own step-mother Julia. He died in Osdroene,t <lb/>
            near Edessa, while he was planning an expedition against the <lb/>
            Parthians, in the sixth year and second month of his reign, <lb/>
            having scarcely passed the forty-second year of his age. He <lb/>
            was buried with a public funeral.</p>
          <p>XXI. OPILIUS MACRINUS, who was captain of the praetorian <lb/>
            guards, and his son DIADUMENUS, were then made emperors, <lb/>
            but did nothing memorable, in consequence of the shortness <lb/>
            of their reign ; for it lasted but a year and two months. They <lb/>
            were both killed together in a mutiny of the soldiers. <note type="footnote"> * Opus lavacri, quœ Antoninianœ appellantur.] The change of <lb/>

            made emperor, who was thought to be the son of Antoninus <lb/>
            Caracalla. He was however priest of the temple of Helio­ <lb/>
            gabalus.* Having come to Rome with high expectations on <lb/>
            the part of the army and the senate, he polluted himself with <lb/>
            every kind of impurity. He led a life of the utmost shame­ <lb/>
            lessness and obscenity, and was killed at the end of two years <lb/>
            and eight months in a tumult of the soldiers. His mother <lb/>
            Soëmia, a native of Syria, perished with him.</p>
          <p>XXIII. To him succeeded AURELIUS ALEXANDER, a very <lb/>
            young man, who was named Cæsar by the army, and Augustus <lb/>
            by the senate. Having undertaken a war with the Persians, <lb/>
            he defeated their king Xerxes with great glory. He enforced <lb/>
            military discipline with much severity, and disbanded whole <lb/>
            legions that raised a disturbance. He had for his adviser, or <lb/>
            secretary of state, Ulpian, the compiler of the law. He was <lb/>
            also in great favour at Rome. He lost his life in Gaul, in a <lb/>

          <p>I. AFTER him MAX.IMIN came to the throne, the first empe­ <lb/>
            ror that was elected from the army by the will of the soldiers, <lb/>
            no approbation of the senate being given, and he himself not <lb/>
            being a senator. After conducting a successful war against <lb/>
            the Germans, and being on that account saluted Imperator. <lb/>
            by his troops, he was slain by Pupienus at Aquileia,† together <lb/>
            with his son who was then but a bov, his soldiers forsaking <lb/>
            him. He had reigned, with his son, three years and a few <lb/>
            days.</p>
          <p>II. There were then three emperors at the same time, <lb/>
            PUPIENUS, BALBINUS, and GORDIAN, the two former of very <lb/>
            obscure origin, the last of noble birth; for the elder Gordian, <lb/>
            his father, had been chosen prince by the consent of the sol­ <lb/>
            diery in the reign of Maximin, when he held the proconsulship <lb/>
            of Africa. When Balbinus and Pupienus came to Rome, they <lb/>
            were killed in the palace; and the empire was given to <lb/>
            Gordian alone.</p>
          <p>After Gordian, when quite a boy, had married Tranquillina at <lb/>
            Rome, he opened the temple of Janus, and, setting out for the <note type="footnote">* In the old sense of the word, as Tzschucke thinks, on account <unclear>o</unclear> <lb/>
            his victory. He had been made emperor before, as appears from <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B. II."/> <lb/>
            east, made war upon the Parthians, who were then proceeding <lb/>
            to make an irruption. This war he soon conducted with suc­ <lb/>
            cess, and made havoc of the Persians in great battles. <lb/>
            As he was returning, he was killed, not far from the <lb/>
            Roman boundaries, by the treachery of Philip who reigned <lb/>
            after him. The Roman soldiers raised a monument for him, <lb/>
            twenty miles from Circessus, which is now a fortress of the <lb/>
            Romans, overlooking the Euphrates. His relics they brought <lb/>
            to Rome, and gave him the title of god.</p>
          <p>III. When Gordian was killed, the two PHILIPS, father and <lb/>
            son, seized on the government, and, having brought off the <lb/>
            army safe, set out from Syria for Italy. In their reign the <lb/>
            thousandth year of the city of Rome was celebrated with games <lb/>
            and spectacles of vast magnificence. Soon after, both of them <lb/>
            were put to death by the soldiery; the elder Philip at Verona, <lb/>
            the younger at Rome. They reigned but five years. They <lb/>
            wore however ranked among the gods.</p>
          <p>IV. After these, DECIUS, a native of Lower Pannonia, born <lb/>
            at Budalia, assumed the government. He suppressed a civil <lb/>
            war which had been raised in Gaul. He created his son Cæsar. <lb/>
            He built a bath at Rome. When he and his son had reigned two <lb/>
            years, they were both killed in the country of the Barbarians, <lb/>
            and enrolled among the gods.</p>
          <p>V. Immediately after, GALLUS, HOSTILIANUS, and VOLUSI­ <lb/>
            ANUS the soil of Gallus, were created emperors. In their reign <lb/>
            Æmilianus attempted an insurrection in Mœsia ; and both* of <lb/>
            them, setting out to stop his progress, were slain at Interamna, <lb/>
            when they had not quite completed a reign of two years. <lb/>
            They did nothing of any account. Their reign was re­ <lb/>
            markable only for a pestilence, and for other diseases and <lb/>
            afflictions.</p>
          <p>VI. ÆMILIANUS was little distinguished by birth, and less <lb/>
            distinguished by his reign, in the third month of which he <lb/>
            was cut off.†</p>
          <p>VII. LICINIUS VALERIAN, who was then employed in Rhæ­ <lb/>
            tia and Norieum, was next made general by the army, and soon <lb/>
            after emperor. GALLIENUS also received the title of Cæsar <lb/>
            from the senate at Rome. The reign of these princes was in­ <note type="footnote"> * Ambo.] Both Gallus and Volusianus.—Tzschucke. </note><note type="footnote"> f Extinctus e8t.] He was killed by the soldiery, according to Zosimus, <lb/>

            jurious, and almost fatal, to the Roman name, either through <lb/>
            their ill-fortune or want of energy. The Germans advanced <lb/>
            as far as Ravenna. Valerian, while he was occupied in a war in <lb/>
            Mesopotamia, was overthrown by Sapor king of Persia, and <lb/>
            being soon after made prisoner, grew old in ignominious slavery <lb/>
            among the Parthians.</p>
          <p>VIII. Gallienus, who was made emperor when quite a <lb/>
            young man, exercised his power at first happily, afterwards <lb/>
            fairly, and at last mischievously. In his youth he performed <lb/>
            many gallant acts in Gaul and Illyricum, killing Ingenuus, <lb/>
            who had assumed the purple, at Mursa,* and Regalianus. He <lb/>
            was then for a long time quiet and gentle; afterwards, <lb/>
            abandoning himself to all manner of licentiousness, he re­ <lb/>
            laxed the reins of government with disgraceful inactivity and <lb/>
            carelesness. The Alemanni, having laid waste Gaul, pene­ <lb/>
            trated into Italy. Dacia, which had been added to the <lb/>
            empire beyond the Danube, was lost. Greece, Macedonia, <lb/>
            Pontus, Asia, were devastated by the Goths. Pannonia was <lb/>
            depopulated by the Sarmatians and Quadi. The Germans <lb/>
            made their way as far as Spain, and took the noble <lb/>
            city of Tarraco. The Parthians, after taking possession of <lb/>
            Mesopotamia, began to bring Syria under their power.</p>
          <p>IX. When affairs were in this desperate condition, and the <lb/>
            Roman empire almost ruined, POSTUMUS, a man of very <lb/>
            obscure birth, assumed the purple in Gaul, and held the <lb/>
            government with such ability for ten years, that he recruited <lb/>
            the provinces, which had been almost ruined, by his great <lb/>
            energy and judgment; but he was killed in a mutiny of the <lb/>
            army, because he would not deliver up Moguntiacum, which <lb/>
            had rebelled against him, to be plundered by the soldiers, at <lb/>
            the time when Lucius Ælianus was endeavouring to effect a <lb/>
            change of government.</p>
          <p>After him Marius, a contemptible mechanic,† assumed the <lb/>
            purple, and was killed two days after. Victorinus then took <lb/>
            on himself the government of Gaul; a man of great energy; <lb/>
            but, as he was abandoned to excessive licentiousness, and <lb/>
            corrupted other men's wives, he was assassinated at Agrip­ <note type="footnote"> * A town of Lower Pannonia, on the river Drave. Cellar. Geog. <lb/>

            pina,* in the second year of his reign, one of his secretaries <lb/>
            having contrived a plot against him.</p>
          <p>X. To him succeeded Tetricus, a senator, who, when he <lb/>
            was governing Aquitania with the title of prefect, was chosen <lb/>
            emperor in his absence, and assumed the purple at Bourdeaux, <lb/>
            He had to endure many insurrections among the soldiery. <lb/>
            But while these transactions were passing in Gaul, the Per­ <lb/>
            sians, in the east, were overthrown by Odenathus, who, having <lb/>
            defended Syria and recovered Mesopotamia, penetrated into <lb/>
            the country as far as Ctesiphon.</p>
          <p>XI. Thus, while Gallienus abandoned the government, the <lb/>
            Roman empire was saved in the west by Posthumus, and in <lb/>
            the east by Odenathus. Meanwhile Gallienus was killed at <lb/>
            Milan, together with his brother, in the ninth year of his <lb/>
            reign, and CLAUDIUS succeeded him, being chosen by the <lb/>
            soldiers, and declared emperor by the senate. Claudius <lb/>
            defeated the Goths, who were laying waste Illyricum and <lb/>
            Macedonia, in a great battle. He was a frugal and modest <lb/>
            man, strictly observant of justice, and well qualified for <lb/>
            governing the empire. He was however carried off by disease <lb/>
            within two years after he began to reign, and had the title of <lb/>
            a god. The senate honoured him with extraordinary distinc­ <lb/>
            tions, insomuch that a golden shield was hung up to him in <lb/>
            the senate house, and a golden statue erected to him in the <lb/>
            Capitol.</p>
          <p>XII. After him QUINTILLUS, the brother of Claudius, was <lb/>
            elected emperor by agreement among the soldiers, a man <lb/>
            of singular moderation and aptitude for governing, comparable, <lb/>
            or perhaps superior, to his brother. He received the title of <lb/>
            emperor with the consent of the senate, and was killed on the <lb/>
            seventeenth day of his reign.</p>
          <p>XIII. After his death AURELIAN succeeded to the throne. <lb/>
            He was born in Dacia Ripensis, and was a man of ability in <lb/>
            war, but of an ungovernable temper, and too much inclined <lb/>
            to cruelty. He defeated the Goths with great vigour, and <lb/>
            extended the Roman empire, by various successes in the field, <lb/>
            to its former limits. He overthrew Tetricus at Catalauni† <note type="footnote"> * A town of the Ubii, so called because Agrippina was born there. It <lb/>

            in Gaul, <unclear>Te</unclear>.ricus himself, indeed, betraying his own army, <lb/>
            whose constant mutinies he was unable to bear ; and he had <lb/>
            even by secret letters entreated Aurelian to march towards <lb/>
            him, using, among other solicitations, the verse of Virgil : — <lb/>
            Eripe me his, invicte, malis. <lb/>
            Unconquer'd hero, free me from these ills.</p>
          <p>He also took prisoner Zenobia, who, having killed her hus­ <lb/>
            band Odenathus, was mistress of the east, in a battle of no <lb/>
            great importance near Antioch, and, entering Rome, celebrated <lb/>
            a magnificent triumph, as recoverer of the east and the west, <lb/>
            Tetricus* and Zenobia going before his chariot. This Tetri­ <lb/>
            cus was afterwards governor of Lucania, and lived long after <lb/>
            he was divested of the purple. Zenobia left descendants, who <lb/>
            still live at Rome.</p>
          <p>XIV. In his reign, the people of the mint raised a rebellion <lb/>
            in the city, after having adulterated the money, and put to <lb/>
            death Felicissimus the commissioner of the treasury. Aure­ <lb/>
            lian suppressed them with the utmost severity; several noble­ <lb/>
            men he condemned to death. He was indeed cruel and <lb/>
            sanguinary, and rather an emperor necessary for the times in <lb/>
            some respects than an amiable one in any. He was always <lb/>
            severe, and put to death even the son of his own sister. He was <lb/>
            however a reformer, in a great degree, of military discipline <lb/>
            and dissoluteness of manners.</p>
          <p>XV. He surrounded the city of Rome with stronger walls. <lb/>
            He built a temple to the Sun, in which he put a vast quantity <lb/>
            of gold and precious stones. The province of Dacia, which <lb/>
            Trajan had formed beyond the Danube, he gave up, despair­ <lb/>
            ing, after all Illyricum and Mœsia had been depopulated, of <lb/>
            being able to retain it. The Roman citizens, removed from <lb/>
            the town and lands of Dacia, he settled in the interior of Mœsia, <lb/>
            calling that Dacia which now divides the two Mœsiæ, and <lb/>
            which is on the right hand of the Danube as it runs to the sea, <lb/>
            whereas Dacia was previously on the left. He was killed <lb/>
            through the treachery of one of his own slaves, who carried to <lb/>
            certain military men, the friends of Aurelian, their own names <lb/>
            entered upon a list, having counterfeited the hand of Aurelian, <lb/>
            and making it appear that he intended to put them to death. <lb/>
            That he might be prevented from doing so, he was assassinated <note type="footnote"> * See c.10. </note> <pb n="522"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.IX."/> <lb/>
            by them in the middle of the road, the old paved way, which <lb/>
            is between Constantinople and Heraclea. The place is called <lb/>
            Cænophrurium. But his death was not unavenged.* He <lb/>
            also gained the honour of being enrolled among the gods. He <lb/>
            reigned five years and six months.</p>
          <p>XVI. After him TACITUS succeeded to the throne; a man <lb/>
            of excellent morals, and well qualified to govern the empire. <lb/>
            He was unable, however, to show the world anything remark­ <lb/>
            able, being cut off by death in the sixth mopth of his reign. <lb/>
            FLORIANUS, who succeeded Tacitus, was on the throne only two <lb/>
            months and twenty days, and did nothing worthy of mention.</p>
          <p>XVII. PROBUS then succeeded to the government, a man <lb/>
            rendered illustrious by the distinction which he obtained <lb/>
            in war. He recovered Gaul, which had been seized by the <lb/>
            Barbarians, by remarkable successes in the field. He also <lb/>
            suppressed, in several battles, some persons that attempted to <lb/>
            seize the throne, as Saturninus in the east, and Proculus and <lb/>
            Bonosus at Agrippina. He allowed the Gauls and Cannonians <lb/>
            to have vineyards. By obliging his soldiers to work, too, he <lb/>
            planted vineyards on Mount Alma in Sirmium, and on Mount <lb/>
            Aureus in Upper Mcesia, and left them to the people of the <lb/>
            provinces to cultivate. After he had gone through a great <lb/>
            number of wars, and had at last obtained peace, he observed, <lb/>
            that " in a short time soldiers would not be wanted." He was <lb/>
            a man of spirit, activity, and justice, equalling Aurelian in <lb/>
            military glory, and surpassing him in affability of manners. <lb/>
            He was killed, however, at Sirmium, in an iron turret, during <lb/>
            an insurrection of the soldiery. He reigned six years and <lb/>
            four months.</p>
          <p>XVIII. After the death of Probus, CARUS was created <lb/>
            emperor, a native of Narbo in Gaul, who immediately made <lb/>
            his sons, Carinus and Numerianus, Cæsars, and reigned, in <lb/>
            conjunction with them, two years. News being brought, while <lb/>
            he was engaged in a war with the Sarmatians, of an insurrec­ <lb/>
            tion among the Persians, he set out for the east, and achieved <lb/>
            some noble exploits against that people ; he routed them in the <lb/>
            field, and took Seleucia and Ctesiphon, their noblest cities, <lb/>
            but, while he was encamped on the Tigris, he was killed by <lb/>
            lightning. His son NUMERIANUS, too, whom he had taken <note type="footnote"> * Tacitus made it his care to put the assassius to death. Vopiso. <lb/>

            with him to Persia, a young man of very great ability, while, <lb/>
            from being affected with a disease in his eyes, he was carried in <lb/>
            a litter, was cut off by a plot of which Aper, his father-in-law, <lb/>
            was the promoter; and his death, though attempted craftily to <lb/>
            be concealed until Aper coald seize the throne, was made known <lb/>
            by the oduur of his dead body; for the soldiers, who attended <lb/>
            liim, being struck by the smell, and opening the curtains of his <lb/>
            litter, discovered his death some days after it had taken place.</p>
          <p>XIX. In the meantime CARINUS, whom Cams, when he <lb/>
            set out to the war with Parthia, had left, with the authority of <lb/>
            Cæsar, to command in Illyricum, Gaul, and Italy, disgraced <lb/>
            himself by all manner of crimes; he put to death many inno­ <lb/>
            cent persons on false accusations, formed illicit connexions with <lb/>
            the wives of noblemen, and wrought the ruin of several of his <lb/>
            school-fellows, who happened to have offended him at school <lb/>
            by some slight provocation. Incurring the hatred of all men <lb/>
            by such proceedings, he not long after met with deserved <lb/>
            punishment.</p>
          <p>The victorious army, on returning from Persia, as they had <lb/>
            lost their emperor Carus by lightning, and the Cæsar Numeri­ <lb/>
            anus by a plot, conferred the imperial dignity on DIOCLETIAN, <lb/>
            a native of Dalmatia, of such extremely obscure birth, that he <lb/>
            is said by most writers to have been the son of a clerk, but <lb/>
            by some to have been a freed man of a senator named Anulinus.</p>
          <p>XX, Diocletian, in the first assembly of the army that was <lb/>
            held, took an oath that Numerian was not killed by any treachery <lb/>
            on his part; and while Aper, who had laid the plot for Nume­ <lb/>
            rian's life, was standing by, he was killed, in the sight of the <lb/>

            overthrew Carinus, who was living under the utmost hatred <lb/>
            and detestation, in a great battle at Margum,* Carinus being <lb/>
            betrayed by his own troops, for though he had a greater num­ <lb/>
            ber of men than the enemy, he was altogether abandoned by <lb/>
            them between Viminacium and mount Aureus. He thus <lb/>
            became master of the Roman empire; and when the peasants <lb/>
            in Gaul made an insurrection, giving their faction the name <lb/>
            of Bagaudæ,† and having for leaders Amandus and Ælianus, <note type="footnote"> * A town in Upper Mcesia, between the Danube and the Margus or <lb/>

            he despatched Maximian Herculius, with the authority of <lb/>
            Caesar, to suppress them. Maximian, in a few battles of <lb/>
            little importance, subdued the rustic multitude, and restored <lb/>
            peace to Gaul.</p>
          <p>XXI, During this period, Carausius, who, though of very <lb/>
            mean birth, had gained extraordinary reputation by a course of <lb/>
            active service in war, having received a commission in his <lb/>
            post at Bononia, to clear the sea, which the Franks and Saxons <lb/>
            infested, along the coast of Belgica and Armorica, and having <lb/>
            captured numbers of the barbarians on several occasions, but <lb/>
            having never given back the entire booty to the people of the <lb/>
            province or sent it to the emperors, and there being a suspi­ <lb/>
            cion, in consequence, that the barbarians were intentionally <lb/>
            allowed by him to congregate there, that he might seize them <lb/>
            and their booty as they passed, and by that means enrich him­ <lb/>
            self, assumed, on being sentenced by Maximian to be put <lb/>
            to death, the imperial purple, and took on him the government <lb/>
            of Britain.</p>
          <p>XXII. While disorder thus prevailed throughout the world, <lb/>
            while Carausius was taking arms in Britain and Achilleus in <lb/>
            Egypt, while the Quinquegentiani * were harassing Africa, <lb/>
            and Narseust was making war upon the east, Diocletian pro­ <lb/>
            moted MAXIMIAN HERCULIUS from the dignity of Cæsar to <lb/>
            that of emperor, and created Constantius and Maximian <lb/>
            Galerius Cæsars, of whom Constantius is said to have been the <lb/>
            grand-nephew of Claudius ‡ by a daughter, and Maximian <lb/>
            Galerius to have been born in Dacia not far from Sardica.§ <lb/>
            That he might also unite them by affinity, Constantius married <lb/>
            Theodora the step-daughter of Herculius, by whom he had <lb/>
            afterwards six children, brothers to Constantine ; while Gale­ <lb/>
            rius married Valeria, the daughter of Diocletian; both being <lb/>
            obliged to divorce the wives that they had before. With <lb/>
            Carausius, however, as hostilities were found vain against a <lb/>
            man eminently skilled in war, a peace was at last arranged. <note type="footnote"> * Cellarius thinks that they may be the same as the Pentapolitani, <lb/>

            At the end of seven years, Allectus, one of his supporters, put <lb/>
            him to death, and held Britain himself for three years subse­ <lb/>
            quently, but was cut off by the efforts of Asclepiodotus, præfect <lb/>
            of the praetorian guard.</p>
          <p>XXIII. At the same period a battle was fought by Con­ <lb/>
            stantius Caesar in Gaul, at Lingonæ,* where he experienced <lb/>
            both good and bad fortune in one day; for though he was <lb/>
            driven into the city by a sudden onset of the barbarians, with <lb/>
            such baste and precipitation that after the gates were shut he <lb/>
            was drawn up the wall by ropes, yet, when his army came up, <lb/>
            after the lapse of scarcely six hours, he cut to pieces about <lb/>
            sixty thousand of the Alemanni. Maximian the emperor, <lb/>
            too, brought the war to an end in Africa, by subduing the <lb/>
            Quinquegentiani, and compelling them to make peace. <lb/>
            Diocletian, meanwhile, besieging Achilleus in Alexandria, <lb/>
            obliged him to surrender about eight months after, and put <lb/>
            him to death. He used his victory, indeed, cruelly, and <lb/>
            distressed all Egypt with severe proscriptions and massacres. <lb/>
            Yet at the same time he made many judicious arrangements <lb/>
            and regulations, which continue to our own days.</p>
          <p>XXIV. Galerius Maximian, in acting against Narseus, <lb/>
            fought, on the first occasion, a battle far from successful, <lb/>
            meeting him between Callinicus and Carræ, and engaging in <lb/>
            the combat rather with rashness than want of courage; for he <lb/>
            contended with a small army against a very numerous enemy. <lb/>
            Being in consequence defeated, and going to join Diocletian, <lb/>
            be was received by him, when he met him on the road, with <lb/>
            such extreme haughtiness, that he is said to have run by his <lb/>
            chariot for several miles in his scarlet robes.</p>
          <p>XXV. But having soon after collected forces in Illyricum <lb/>
            and Mœsia, he fought a second time with Narseus (the grand­ <lb/>
            father of Hormisdas and Sapor), in Greater Armenia, with <lb/>
            extraordinary success, and with no less caution and spirit, for <lb/>
            he undertook, with one or two of the cavalry, the office of a <lb/>
            speculator.† After putting Narseus to flight, he captured his <note type="footnote"> * Apud Lingonas.] Lingonæ, or Lingones, the chief town of the <lb/>

            wives, sisters, and children, with a vast number of the <lb/>
            Persian nobility besides, and a great quantity of treasure; the <lb/>
            king himself he forced to take refuge in the remotest deserts <lb/>
            in his dominions. Returning therefore in triumph to <lb/>
            Diocletian, who was then encamped with some troops in <lb/>
            Mesopotamia, he was welcomed by him with great honour. <lb/>
            Subsequently, they conducted several wars both in conjunction <lb/>
            and separately, subduing the Carpi and Bastarnæ, and <lb/>
            defeating the Sarmatians, from which nations he settled a <lb/>
            great number of captives in the Roman territories.</p>
          <p>XXVI. Diocletian was of a crafty disposition, with much <lb/>
            sagacity, and keen penetration. He was willing to gratify his <lb/>
            own disposition to cruelty in such a way as to throw the odium <lb/>
            upon others; he was however a very active and able prince. <lb/>
            He was the first that introduced into the Roman empire a <lb/>
            ceremony suited rather to royal usages than to Roman liberty, <lb/>
            giving orders that he should be adored,* whereas all emperors <lb/>
            before him were only saluted. He put ornaments of precious <lb/>
            stones on his dress and shoes, when the imperial distinction <lb/>
            had previously been only in the purple robe, the rest of the <lb/>
            habit being the same as that of other men.</p>
          <p>XXVII. But Herculius was undisguisedly cruel, and of a <lb/>
            violent temper, and showed his severity of disposition in the <lb/>
            sternness of his looks. Gratifying his own inclination, he <lb/>
            joined with Diocletian in even the most cruel of his proceed­ <lb/>
            ings. But when Diocletian, as age bore heavily upon him, <lb/>
            felt himself unable to sustain the government of the empire, he <lb/>
            suggested to Herculius that they should both retire into <lb/>
            private life, and commit the duty of upholding the state to <lb/>
            more vigorous and youthful hands. With this suggestion his <lb/>
            colleague reluctantly complied. Both of them, in the same <lb/>
            day, exchanged the robe of empire for an ordinary dress, <lb/>
            Diocletian at Nicomedia, Herculius at Milan, soon after a <lb/>
            magnificent triumph which they celebrated at Rome over <lb/>
            several nations, with a noble succession of pictures,! and in <lb/>

            other into Lucania.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. Diocletian lived to an old age in a private <lb/>
            station, at a villa which is not far from Salonæ, in honourable <lb/>
            retirement, exercising extraordinary philosophy, inasmuch as <lb/>
            he alone of all men, since the foundation of the Roman <lb/>
            empire, voluntarily returned from so high a dignity to the <lb/>
            condition of private life, and to an equality with the other <lb/>
            citizens. That happened to him, therefore, which had <lb/>
            happened to no one since men were created, that, though he <lb/>
            died in a private condition, he was enrolled among the gods.</p>

          <p>I. THESE emperors, then, having retired from the govern­ <lb/>
            ment of the state, CONSTANTIUS and GALERIUS were made <lb/>
            emperors; and the Roman world was divided between them <lb/>
            in such a manner, that Constantius had Gaul, Italy, and <lb/>
            Africa; Galerius Illyricum, Asia, and the East; two Cæsars <lb/>
            being joined with them. Constantius, however, content with <lb/>
            the dignity of emperor, declined the care of governing Africa. <pb n="528"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BX."/> <lb/>
            He was an excellent man, of extreme benevolence, who studied <lb/>
            to increase the resources, of the provinces and of private <lb/>
            persons, cared tut little for the improvement of the public <lb/>
            treasury, and used to say that " it was better for the national <lb/>
            wealth to be in the hands of individuals than to be laid up in <lb/>
            one place of confinement." So moderate was the furniture of <lb/>
            his house, too, that if, on holidays, he had to entertain a <lb/>
            greater number of friends than ordinary, his dining-rooms were <lb/>
            set out with the plate of private persons, borrowed from their <lb/>
            several houses. By the Gauls* he was not only beloved <lb/>
            but venerated, especially because, under his government, they <lb/>
            had escaped the suspicious prudence of Diocletian, and the <lb/>
            sanguinary rashness of Maximian. He died in Britain, at <lb/>
            York, in the thirteenth year of his reign, and was enrolled <lb/>
            among the gods.</p>
          <p>II. Galerius, a man of excellent moral character, and skil. <lb/>
            ful in military affairs, finding that Italy, by Constantius's <lb/>
            permission, was put under his government, created two <lb/>
            Cæsars, MAXIMIN, whom he appointed over the east, and <lb/>
            SEVERUS, to whom he committed Italy. He himself resided <lb/>
            in Illyricum But after the death of Constantius, CONSTAN <lb/>
            TINE, his son by a wife of obscure birth, was made emperor in <lb/>
            Britain, and succeeded his father as a most desirable ruler. <lb/>
            In the meantime the prætorian guards at Rome, having risen <lb/>
            in insurrection, declared MAXENTIUS, the son of Maximian <lb/>
            Herculius, who lived in the Villa Publica† not far from the <lb/>
            city, emperor. At the news of this proceeding, Maximian, <lb/>
            filled with hopes of regaining the imperial dignity, which he <lb/>
            had not willingly resigned, hurried to Rome from Lucania, <lb/>
            (which, on retiring into private life, he had chosen for his <lb/>
            place of residence, spending his old age in a most delightful <lb/>
            country), and stimulated Diocletian by letters to resume the <lb/>
            authority that he had laid down, letters which Diocletian <lb/>
            utterly disregarded. Severus Cæsar, being despatched to <lb/>
            Rome by Galerius to suppress the rising of the guards and <lb/>
            Maxentius, arrived there with his army, but, as he was laying <lb/>
            siege to the city, was deserted through the treachery of his <lb/>
            so diers. <note type="footnote"> * He had reserved Gaul for his own peculiar province.—<unclear>Tzschuke</unclear> </note><note type="footnote"> t A building in the Campus Martins, intended chiefly as a <unclear/> <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="on. in. J"/> </p>
          <p>III. The power of Maxentius was thus increased, and his <lb/>
            government established. Severus, taking to flight, was killed <lb/>
            at Ravenna. Maximian Herculius, attempting afterwards, in <lb/>
            an assembly of the army, to divest his son Maxentius of his <lb/>
            power, met with nothing but mutiny and reproaches from the <lb/>
            soldiery. He then set out for Gaul, on a planned stratagem, <lb/>
            as if he had been driven away by his son, that he might join <lb/>
            his son-in-law Constantine,* designing, however, if he could <lb/>
            find an opportunity, to cut off Constàntine, who was ruling in <lb/>
            Gaul with great approbation both of the soldiers and the <lb/>
            people of the province, having overthrown the Franks and <lb/>
            Alemanni with great slaughter, and captured their kings, <lb/>
            whom, on exhibiting a magnificent show of games, he exposed <lb/>
            to wild beasts. But the plot being made known by Maxi­ <lb/>
            mian's daughter Fausta, who communicated the design to her <lb/>
            husband, Maximian was cut off at Marseilles, whence he was <lb/>
            preparing to sail to join his son, and died a well-deserved <lb/>
            death ; for he was a man inclined to every kind of cruelty and <lb/>
            severity, faithless, perverse, and utterly void of consideration <lb/>
            . for others.</p>
          <p>IV. At this time LICINIUS, a native of Dacia, was made <lb/>
            emperor by Galerius, to whom he was known by old compa­ <lb/>
            nionship, and recommended by his vigorous efforts and services <lb/>
            in the war which he had conducted against Narseus. The death <lb/>
            of Galerius followed immediately afterwards. The empire was <lb/>
            then held by the four new emperors, Constantine and Maxen­ <lb/>
            tius, sons of emperors, Licinius and Maximian, sons of undistin. <lb/>
            guished men. Constantine, however, in the fifth year of his <lb/>
            reign, commenced a civil war with Maxentius, routed his <lb/>
            forces in several battles, and at last overthrew Maxentius <lb/>
            himself (when he was spreading death among the nobility by <lb/>
            every possible kind of cruelty,t) at the Milvian bridge, and <lb/>
            made himself master of Italy. Not long after, too, Maximin, <lb/>
            after commencing hostilities against Licinius in the east, anti­ <lb/>
            cipated the destruction that was falling upon him by an <lb/>
            accidental death at Tarsus.</p>
          <p>V. CONSTANTINE, being a man of great energy, bent upon <lb/>

            the sovereignty of the whole world, proceeded to make war on <lb/>
            Licinius, although he had formed a connexion with him by <lb/>
            marriage,* for his sister Constantia was married to Licinius. <lb/>
            And first of all be overthrew him, by a sudden attack, at <lb/>
            Cibalæ in Pannonia, where he was making vast preparations <lb/>
            for war; and after becoming master of Dardania, Mæsia, and <lb/>
            Macedonia, took possession also of several other provinces.</p>
          <p>VI. There were then various contests between them, and <lb/>
            peace made and broken. At last Licinius, defeated in a battle <lb/>
            at Nicomedia by sear and land, surrendered himself, and, in <lb/>
            violation of an oath taken by Constantine, was put to death, <lb/>
            after being divested of the purple, at Thessalonica.</p>
          <p>At this time the Roman empire fell under the sway of one <lb/>
            emperor and three Cæsars, a state of things which had never <lb/>
            existed before; the sons of Constantine ruling over Gaul, the <lb/>
            east, and Italy. But the pride of prosperity caused Constantine <lb/>
            greatly to depart from his former agreeable mildness of temper. <lb/>
            calling first upon his own relatives, he put to death his son, <lb/>
            an excellent man; his sister's son, a youth of amiable disposi­ <lb/>
            tion ; soon afterwards his wife, and subsequently many of his <lb/>
            friends.</p>
          <p>VII. He was a man, who, in the beginning of his reign, <lb/>
            might have been compared to the best princes; in the latter <lb/>
            part of it, only to those of a middling character. Innumerable <lb/>
            good qualities of mind and body were apparent in him; he <lb/>
            was exceedingly ambitious of military glory, and had great <lb/>
            success in his wars; a success, however, not more than pro­ <lb/>
            portioned to his exertions. After he had terminated the Civil <lb/>
            war, he also overthrew the Goths on various occasions, granting <lb/>
            them at last peace, and leaving on the minds of the barbarians <lb/>
            a strong remembrance of his kindness. He was attached to <lb/>
            the arts of peace and to liberal studies, and was ambitious of <lb/>
            honourable popularity, which he, indeed, sought by every kind <lb/>
            of liberality and obligingness. Though he was slow, from <lb/>
            suspicion, to serve some of his friends,† yet he was exceedingly <note type="footnote"> * Necessitudo illi et affinitas cum eo esset.] He had a necessitudo or <lb/>
            relationship with him, which relationship was an affinitas, or alliance <lb/>
            by marriage. Affinitas is added, as Tzschucke observes, to explain <lb/>
            necessitudo, which, consequently, might very well be omitted. </note><note type="footnote"> † In nonnullus amicos dubius.] I have translated this phrase in <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH. VIII.]"/> <lb/>
            generous towards others, neglecting no opportunity to add to <lb/>
            their riches and honours.</p>
          <p>VIII. He enacted many laws, some good and equitable, <lb/>
            but most of them superfluous, and some severe. He was the <lb/>
            first that endeavoured to raise the city named after him * to <lb/>
            such a height as to make it a rival to Rome. As he was pre­ <lb/>
            paring for war against the Parthians, who were then disturbing <lb/>
            Mesopotamia, he died in the Villa Publica, † at Nicomedia, in <lb/>
            the thirty-first year of his reign, and the sixty-sixth of his <lb/>
            age. His death was foretold by a star with a tail, which <lb/>
            shone for a long time, of extraordinary size, and which the <lb/>
            Greeks call a <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰομήτης</foreign>. He was deservedly enrolled among <lb/>
            the gods.</p>
          <p>IX. He left for his successors three sons and one nephew, <lb/>
            the son of his brother. But DALMATIUS CÆSAR, a man of <lb/>
            happy genius, and not unlike his brother, was soon after cut <lb/>
            off by a mutiny among the soldiers, Constantius, his cousin, <lb/>
            sanctioning the act, rather than commanding it. The officers <lb/>
            of Constans also put to death CONSTANTINE, when he was <lb/>
            making war upon his brother, and had rashly commenced an <lb/>
            engagement at Aquileia. Thus the government was left in <lb/>
            the hands of two emperors. The rule of CONSTANS was for <lb/>
            some time energetic and just, but afterwards, falling into ill­ <lb/>
            health, and being swayed by ill-designing friends, he indulged <lb/>
            in great vices; and, becoming intolerable to the people of the <lb/>
            provinces, and unpopular with the soldiery, was killed by a <lb/>
            party headed by Magnentius. He died not far from the borders <lb/>
            of Spain, in a fortress named Helena, in the seventeenth year <lb/>
            of his reign, and the thirtieth of his age; yet not till he had <lb/>
            performed many gallant actions in the field, and had made <lb/>
            himself feared by the army through the whole course of his <lb/>
            life, though without exercising any extraordinary severity.</p>
          <p>X. The fortune of CONSTANTIUS was different; for he suf­ <lb/>
            fered many grievous calamities at the hands of the Persians, <lb/>
            his towns being often taken, his walled cities besieged, and <lb/>
            his troops cut off. Nor had he a single successful engagement <lb/>
            with Sapor, except that, at Singara, when victory might <lb/>
            certainly have been his, he lost it, through the irrepressible <lb/>
            eagerness of his men, who, contrary to the practice of war, <note type="footnote"> * Constantinople. </note><note type="footnote"> A building similar to the one at Rome mentioned in a 2. </note> <note type="footnote"> </note><note type="footnote">M M 2 </note> <pb n="532"/>

            mutinously and foolishly called for battle when the day was <lb/>
            declining. After the death of Constans, when MAGNENTIUS <lb/>
            held the government of Italy, Africa, and Gaul, Illyricum <lb/>
            also felt some new commotions, VETRANIO being elected to <lb/>
            the throne by a combination of the soldiery, whom they made <lb/>
            emperor when he was very old and universally popular from <lb/>
            the length and success of his service in the field; an upright <lb/>
            man, of morality severe as that of the ancients, and of an agree­ <lb/>
            able unassumingness of manner, but so ignorant of all polite <lb/>
            learning, that he did not even acquire the first rudiments of <lb/>
            literature until he was old and had become emperor.</p>
          <p>XI. But the imperial authority was snatched from Vetranio <lb/>
            by Constantius, who stirred up a civil war to avenge his <lb/>
            brother's death; Vetranio being compelled, with the consent <lb/>
            of the soldiers, and, by a new and extraordinary proceeding, to <lb/>
            divest himself of the purple. There was at the same time an <lb/>
            insurrection at Rome. Nepotianus, a son of Constantine's <lb/>
            sister, endeavouring to secure the throne with the aid of a <lb/>
            body of gladiators; but he met with an end such as his savage <lb/>
            attempts merited, for he was cut off on the twenty-eighth <lb/>
            day of his usurpation by the officers of Magnentius, and paid <lb/>
            the penalty of his rashness. His head was carried through <lb/>
            the city on a lance; and dreadful proscriptions and massacres <lb/>
            of the nobility ensued.</p>
          <p>XII. Not long afterwards Magnentius was overthrown in a <lb/>
            battle at Mursa,* and nearly taken prisoner. Vast forces of <lb/>
            the Roman empire were cut off in that struggle, sufficient for <lb/>
            any foreign wars, and for procuring many triumphs, and a <lb/>
            lasting peace. Soon after, GALLUS, his uncle's son, was <lb/>
            appointed by Constantius, as Cæsar, over the east; and <lb/>
            Magnentius, being defeated in several battles, put an end to his <lb/>
            life at Lyons, in the third year and seventh month of his reign, <lb/>
            as did also his brother at Sens, † whom he had sent as Caesar <lb/>
            to defend Gaul.</p>
          <p>XIII. About this time the Caesar Gallus, after committing <lb/>
            inany tyrannical acts, was put to death by Constantius. <lb/>
            Gallus was a man naturally cruel, and too much inclined to <lb/>
            tyranny, if he could but have reigned in his own right <note type="footnote"> * See ix. 8. </note><note type="footnote"> t Senonis.] TLe ablative case of Senom, orum, previously called <lb/>
            Agendicum, now Sens. </note> <pb n="533"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH. XVI.]"/> <lb/>
            Silvanus also, who attempted an insurrection in Gaul, was cut <lb/>
            off before the end of thirty days; and Constantius then <lb/>
            remained sole ruler and emperor over the Roman dominions.</p>
          <p>XIV. He then sent into Gaul, with the authority of Cæsar, <lb/>
            his cousin Julian, the brother of Gallus, giving him his sister <lb/>
            in marriage, at a time when the barbarians had stormed many <lb/>
            towns and were besieging others, when there was every where <lb/>
            direful devastation, and when the Roman empire was tottering <lb/>
            in evident distress. But by Julian, with but a moderate force, <lb/>
            vast numbers of the Alemanni were cut off at Strasburg, a city <lb/>
            of Gaul; their distinguished king was taken prisoner, and <lb/>
            Gaul recovered. Many other honourable achievements, too, <lb/>
            were afterwards performed by Julian against the barbarians, <lb/>
            the Germans being driven beyond the Rhine, and the Roman <lb/>
            empire extended to its former limits.</p>
          <p>XV. Not long after, when the German armies were with­ <lb/>
            drawing from the defence of Gaul, JULIAN was made emperor by <lb/>
            the unanimous consent of the army, and, after the lapse of a <lb/>
            year, went to take the government of Illyricum, while Con­ <lb/>
            stantius was engaged in the war with Parthia. Constantius, <lb/>
            hearing what had occurred, and returning to the civil strife, <lb/>
            died on his march between Cilicia and Cappadocia, in the <lb/>
            thirty-eighth year of his reign, and the forty-fifth of his age, <lb/>
            and was deservedly enrolled among the gods. He was a man <lb/>
            of a remarkably tranquil disposition, good-natured, trusting too <lb/>
            much to his friends and courtiers, and at last too much in the <lb/>
            power of his wives. He conducted himself with great mode­ <lb/>
            ration in the commencement of his reign; he enriched his <lb/>
            friends, and suffered none, whose active services he had <lb/>
            experienced, to go unrewarded. He was however somewhat <lb/>
            inclined to severity, whenever any suspicion of an attempt on <lb/>
            the government was excited in him ; otherwise he was gentle. <lb/>
            His fortune is more to be praised in civil than in foreign <lb/>
            wars.</p>
          <p>XVI. Julian then became sole emperor, and made war, <lb/>
            with a vast force, upon the Parthians; in which expedition I was <lb/>
            also present. Several towns and fortresses of the Persians he <lb/>
            induced to surrender, or took them by storm ; and, having laid <lb/>
            waste Assyria, fixed his camp for some time at Ctesiphon. <lb/>
            As he was returning victorious, and mingling rashly in the <lb/>
            thick of a battle, he was killed by the hand of an enemy, on <pb n="534"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="BOOK X."/> <lb/>
            the 26th of June, in the seventh year of his reign, and <lb/>
            the thirty-second of his age, and was enrolled among the gods. <lb/>
            He was a remarkable man, and one that would have governed <lb/>
            the empire with honour, if he had but been permitted by the <lb/>
            fates. He was eminently accomplished in liberal branches of <lb/>
            knowledge, but better read in the literature of the Greeks, so <lb/>
            much so indeed that his Latin was by no means comparable to <lb/>
            his Greek learning. He was possessed of great and ready <lb/>
            eloquence, and of a most tenacious memory. In some respects <lb/>
            he was more like a philosopher than a prince. Towards his <lb/>
            friends he was liberal, yet less discriminating as to the objects <lb/>
            of his generosity than became so great an emperor; for .there <lb/>
            were some of them that cast a stain on his glory. To the <lb/>
            people of the provinces he was most just, and remitted the <lb/>
            taxes on them as far as was possible. He was indulgent <lb/>
            towards all men ; he felt no great anxiety about the public <lb/>
            treasury; but of glory he was a great lover, and manifested <lb/>
            even an intemperate desire for the attainment of it. He was <lb/>
            a persecutor of the Christian religion, yet so that he abstained <lb/>
            from shedding blood. He was not unlike Marcus Antoninus, <lb/>
            whom he even studied to rival.</p>
          <p>XVII. After him JOVIAN, who attended him in the expe­ <lb/>
            dition as one of his body-guard, was chosen by the suffrages <lb/>
            of the soldiers to fill the throne ; a man better known to the <lb/>
            army by the fame of his father than by his own. As affairs <lb/>
            were now in confusion, and the army distressed for want of <lb/>
            provisions, Jovian, after being defeated in one or two battles <lb/>
            by the Persians, made peace with Sapor, a peace which was <lb/>
            necessary indeed, but ignominious, for he was obliged to contract <lb/>
            his boundaries, a portion of the Roman dominions being <lb/>
            ceded to the enemy; a disgrace which had never occurred, <lb/>
            before his time, since the Roman empire had been founded, <lb/>
            during a space of one thousand one hundred and eighteen <lb/>
            years. And though our legions were made to pass under the <lb/>
            yoke, both at Caudium by Pontus Telesinus,* at Numantia <lb/>
            in Spain, and in Numidia, yet no part of the Roman territory <lb/>
            was given up on any of those occasions. Such terms would <lb/>
            not have been altogether reprehensible, if he had been <note type="footnote"> * This Pontius is not generally called Telesinus; the other Pontius, <unclear/> <lb/>
            ho was distinguished as leader of the Samnites in the Social war, had <lb/>
            that name. See Florus, iii. 18. </note> <pb n="535"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH XVIII.]"/> <lb/>
            resolved, when it should be in his power, to throw off the <lb/>
            obligation of the treaty, as was done by the Romans in all the <lb/>
            wars that I have mentioned; for war was immediately after <lb/>
            made upon the Samnites, Numantines, and Numidians, and the <lb/>
            peace was never ratified. But being in dread, as long as he <lb/>
            remained in the east, of a rival for the imperial dignity, he <lb/>
            thought too little of his glory. After marching from thence, <lb/>
            accordingly, and directing his course towards Illyricum, he <lb/>
            died suddenly on the borders of Galatia. Be was a man, in <lb/>
            other parts of his conduct, deficient neither in energy nor <lb/>
            understanding,</p>
          <p>XVIII. Many think that he was carried off by a violent fit <lb/>
            of indigestion, for he had indulged in delicacies at supper; <lb/>
            others suppose that he died of the odour of his chamber, which, <lb/>
            from a recent plastering of lime, was dangerous to such as <lb/>
            slept in it; others imagine that he fell a victim to the over­ <lb/>
            powering effects of charcoal, which he had ordered to be burnt <lb/>
            in great abundance on account of the extreme cold. He died <lb/>
            in the seventh month of his reign, on the 18th of April, <lb/>
            in the thirty-third year of his age,- and, by the kindness of <lb/>
            the emperors that succeeded him, was enrolled among the <lb/>
            gods; for he was inclined to equity, and liberal by nature.</p>
          <p>Such was the state of the Roman empire in the consulship of <lb/>
            the Emperor Jovian and Varronianus, in the year one thousand <lb/>
            one hundred and nineteen from the foundation of the city. <lb/>
            But as we have now come to illustrious and venerable princes, <lb/>
            we shall here fix a limit to the present part of our work ; for <lb/>
            the things that remain must be told in a more elevated style ; <lb/>
            and we do not, for the present, so much omit them, as <lb/>
            reserve them for higher efforts in writing. <note type="footnote"> * The words ut qui plurimum minimumque tradunt, which occur <lb/>
