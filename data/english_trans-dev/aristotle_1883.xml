          </head>
          <p>THE following Translation of Aristotle's History of Ani­ mals has been made from the text of Schneider. In a work <lb/>
            of considerable difficulty it is hardly possible entirely to <lb/>
            avoid errors; but it is hoped that those which have escaped <lb/>
            are neither numerous nor important. The notes of <lb/>
            Schneider have been consulted throughout; and in places <lb/>
            of difficulty the English translation by Taylor, the French <lb/>
            of Camus, and the German of Strack, have been severally <lb/>
            referred to.</p>
          <p>The work itself is the most ancient and celebrated contri­ <lb/>
            bution to science which has come down to us; and it is <lb/>
            hardly possible, when we consider the means of observation <lb/>
            which were accessible at the time, to imagine a work of <lb/>
            more accurate observation. From the numerous quotations <lb/>
            in which our author avails himself of the experience of <lb/>
            his predecessors in the same field, as well as corrects <lb/>
            their errors, there can be no doubt that Aristotle had the <lb/>
            advantage of many works which have perished in the lapse <lb/>
            of ages. In the Appendix to the present Translation <lb/>
            will be found the Essay of Schneider on the sources <lb/>
            whence Aristotle derived his knowledge of the animals he <lb/>
            describes; and these sources, together with his own accu­ <pb n="iv"/>
             rate observations, are probably sufficient to account for the <lb/>
            correct knowledge of the history of animals displayed <lb/>
            throughout the work.</p>
          <p>It is right, perhaps, to observe in this place, that Dr. <lb/>
            Smith, in his Dictionary of Biography, speaks of the ' His­ <lb/>
            tory of Animals ' as partly the result of the royal liberality <lb/>
            of Alexander; and doubtless Aristotle would gladly have <lb/>
            introduced into his work any fresh materials which might <lb/>
            have been made available to him either during his residence <lb/>
            at the Macedonian court, or by the subsequent victories of <lb/>
            Alexander in the East, if the information so obtained had <lb/>
            reached Athens in sufficient time to be incorporated. But <lb/>
            in the first instance he would naturally use the mate­ <lb/>
            rials ready to his hand in the works of his predecessors, <lb/>
            and these were not few. The animals also which he de­ <lb/>
            scribes are principally those of Greece and of the countries <lb/>
            with which the enterprising Greeks had frequent and com­ <lb/>
            mercial intercourse. He says little of the animals of the <lb/>
            interior of Asia and of India, and speaks very cautiously of <lb/>
            such as he does mention; and one who quotes his authorities <lb/>
            so freely would hardly have failed to notice the sources of <lb/>
            his information.</p>
          <p>The study, or at least the knowledge of the classification <lb/>
            of animals appears to have been carefully pursued in the <lb/>
            earliest period of man's history. The oldest records that <lb/>
            we possess contain abundant notices of the peculiarities of <lb/>
            animals. The Mosaic law abounds in them, in its distinc­ <lb/>
            tions between the clean and the unclean, a distinction not <lb/>
            then first established, but of the most remote antiquity. <lb/>
            Indeed it could hardly be otherwise than that men engaged <lb/>
            in the pursuits of agriculture and the chase should study <lb/>
            the habits of the animals that were valuable to them, as well <lb/>
            as those which were injurious. A study thus commenced <lb/>
             <pb n="v"/>
            by necessity, would eventually be pursued for its own sake; <lb/>
            and not a few would be found who would investigate, and, <lb/>
            as far as they could, record the various phenomena they <lb/>
            observed. The paintings of Egypt and the sculptures of <lb/>
            Assyria are our witnesses of the skill with which animals <lb/>
            and plants were drawn, and of the minute perception <lb/>
            of their external forms; and the knowledge thus gained <lb/>
            in the ancient centres of civilization would be sure to <lb/>
            circulate and increase when the intercourse with foreign <lb/>
            nations spread the knowledge and philosophy so acquired.</p>
          <p>In the writings of Homer we find that the knowledge of <lb/>
            the anatomy of the human body had already made consi­ <lb/>
            derable progress; and the inspection of the animals offered <lb/>
            in sacrifice cannot fail to have added much to the general <lb/>
            knowledge of their history. A century later, we have the <lb/>
            poems of Hesiod, devoted to the encouragement of agricul­ <lb/>
            ture and rural pursuits. Pythagoras, in the seventh cen­ <lb/>
            tury B.C., may perhaps have left no writings, but we know <lb/>
            that he was an eminent student and exponent of natural <lb/>
            phenomena. His contemporary, Alcmæon of Crotona, is <lb/>
            especially mentioned by Aristotle; and he is eminent among <lb/>
            natural philosophers as the first who is said to have recom­ <lb/>
            mended to his followers the practice of dissection. Empe­ <lb/>
            docles of Agrigentum left a work on the phenomena of na­ <lb/>
            ture, of which a few fragments still remain, and there were <lb/>
            also others who, if they did not enter into the details of <lb/>
            what we now call natural history, treated generally of the <lb/>
            nature of things, and opened the field to those who would <lb/>
            study the subject in its particular parts. The empire <lb/>
            of Persia was still the dominant power, and was carrying <lb/>
            the civilization of the East to every part of the known <lb/>
            world when Ctesias wrote his great works, of which, un­ <lb/>
            happily, only a few fragments remain. He described not <lb/>
             <pb n="vi"/>
            only the history of his own time, but also the natural history <lb/>
            of Persia and of India, and that probably with more accu­ <lb/>
            racy than has been usually attributed to him. India he had <lb/>
            not visited personally, so that he could only describe it <lb/>
            from the information of others; but this implies that he <lb/>
            was not alone in the studies which he devoted to natural <lb/>
            objects. With such predecessors and aided by his own <lb/>
            acute observations, we need not wonder that Aristotle pro­ <lb/>
            duced a work which has ever been admired by naturalists, <lb/>
            and must continue to rise in their estimation the longer <lb/>
            it is in their hands.</p>
          <p>The Index to the present volume has been formed on the <lb/>
            basis of that of Schneider, and considerable pains have been <lb/>
            taken to add as many names as possible from other sources, <lb/>
            especially the Index of Strack, and Külb's recent translation <lb/>
            of the History of Animals, both of which contain identifica­ <lb/>
            tions of a great many animals. A few identifications have <lb/>
            also been added from Liddell and Scott's Lexicon, as well as <lb/>
            from Professor Bell's Catalogue of Animals in Captain Spratt's <lb/>
            work on Lycia; and the cephalopods are named from Pro­ <lb/>
            fessor Owen's article on that class, in the Cyclopædia of <lb/>
            Anatomy. It is hoped, therefore, that the Index will be <lb/>
            found to contain a greater number of suggestions for the <lb/>
            identification of the animals mentioned by Aristotle than <lb/>
            have been hitherto published collectively. It is also right to <lb/>
            add, that it has been compiled after the translation was com­ <lb/>
            pleted ; and, therefore, in any differences which may be found <lb/>
            between the identifications at the foot of the page and those <lb/>
            given in the Index, the reader will rather prefer the latter, <lb/>
            as the result of later research in works which were not ac­ <lb/>
            cessible when the translation was made. <note type="footnote"> April 30, 1862. R. C. </note></p><pb n="vii"/>

          </ab>
          <p>BOOK I.-The work commences with a general review of <lb/>
            the animal kingdom, and several suggestions for a natural <lb/>
            arrangement of animals in groups, according to their <lb/>
            external form or their mode of life, a comparison of animals <lb/>
            among themselves, and a description of some of their habits. <lb/>
            Aristotle then introduces the human form, the best known <lb/>
            to man, as the standard of comparison to which he refers <lb/>
            the rest of the animal kingdom. The concluding chapters <lb/>
            of this book are occupied with a description of the several <lb/>
            parts of the human body, both internal and external.</p>
          <p>BOOK II.—In the second book the different parts of ani­ <lb/>
            mals are described. The animals are arranged in various <lb/>
            groups, viviparous and oviparous quadrupeds, fish, ser­ <lb/>
            pents, birds. The only animals described are those with <lb/>
            red blood: the description of the rest being reserved for the <lb/>
            fourth book. Their internal organs are also described; and <lb/>
            in the course of the book a few animals, as the ape, ele­ <lb/>
            phant, and chameleon, are especially noticed.</p>
          <p>BOOK III.-The third book commences with a description <lb/>
            of the internal organs, beginning with the generative <lb/>
            system. A considerable portion of the book is devoted to <lb/>
            the course of the veins; and Aristotle quotes from other <lb/>
            writers, as well as states the result of his own observations. <lb/>
            He then describes the nature of other constituent parts of <lb/>
            the body, sinews, fibres, bone, marrow, cartilage, nails, <lb/>
            hoofs, claws, horns, and beaks of birds, hair, scales, mem­ <lb/>
            branes, flesh, fat, blood, marrow, milk, and the spermatic fluid.</p>
          <p>BOOK IV.—Animals without blood, and first, the cepha­ <lb/>
             <pb n="viii"/>
            lopods, are described; then the crustaceans, testacea, echi­ <lb/>
            nidæ, ascidians, actiniæ, hermit crabs, insects. In the eighth <lb/>
            chapter the organs of sense are considered, and afterwards, <lb/>
            the voice, sleep, age, and differences of the sexes in animals <lb/>
            are described.</p>
          <p>BOOK V.-In the former books animals are for the most <lb/>
            part described with reference to their several parts. In the <lb/>
            fifth book they are treated as entire, and especially with <lb/>
            regard to their mode of reproduction. First of all, our <lb/>
            author treats of spontaneous reproduction, and then of <lb/>
            those animals which spring from a union of the sexes ; and <lb/>
            from this he proceeds to some detail with respect to <lb/>
            different groups of animals, testacea, crustacea, insects. <lb/>
            The book concludes with a long description of bees and <lb/>
            their habits.</p>
          <p>BOOK VI.-In this book the same subject is continued <lb/>
            through the several classes of birds, fish, and quadrupeds. <lb/>
            This account of the reproduction of animals includes also <lb/>
            the consideration of the seasons, climates, and ages of <lb/>
            animals, and how far these influence their reproduction.</p>
          <p>BOOK VII.-The seventh book is almost entirely devoted <lb/>
            to the consideration of the reproduction of man, and an <lb/>
            account of man from his birth to his death. This book <lb/>
            ends abruptly, and is probably imperfect.</p>
          <p>BOOK VIII.-In the eighth book Aristotle passes on to <lb/>
            the most interesting part of his work, the character and <lb/>
            habits of the whole animal world, as it was known to him. <lb/>
            The amount of detail which he has collected and arranged <lb/>
            on this subject is most interesting. He treats, first of all, <lb/>
            of the food of animals, of their migrations, their health and <lb/>
            diseases, and the influence of climate upon them.</p>
          <p>BOOK IX.-The subject of the eighth book is continued, <lb/>
            with an account of the relations in which animals stand <lb/>
            <pb n="ix"/>
            to each other, and especially the friendship and hostility <lb/>
            of different species ; and these are for the most part re­ <lb/>
            ferred to the nature of their food, and their mode of pro­ <lb/>
            curing it. The notices of fish are not so numerous as those <lb/>
            of other groups : this would necessarily arise from the diffi­ <lb/>
            culty of observation. At the conclusion of the book, an <lb/>
            essay on bees and their congeners is given at considerable <lb/>
            length.</p>
          <p>BOOK X.—This book, in all probability erroneously as­ <lb/>
            cribed to Aristotle, is occupied with a treatise on the <lb/>
            causes of barrenness in the human species. It appears <lb/>
            to be rather a continuation of the seventh book, which ends <lb/>
            abruptly; but it is well placed at the end, as no genuine <lb/>
            work of our author.</p>

          <p>1. SOME parts of animals are simple, and these can be <lb/>
            divided into like parts, as flesh into pieces of flesh; others are <lb/>
            compound, and cannot be divided into like parts, as the <lb/>
            hand cannot be divided into hands, nor the face into faces. <lb/>
            Of these some are not only called parts, but members, such as <lb/>
            those which, though entire in themselves, are made up of <lb/>
            other parts, as the head and the leg, the hand and the entire <lb/>
            arm, or the trunk; for these parts are both entire in them­ <lb/>
            selves, and made up of other parts.</p>
          <p>2. All the compound parts also are made up of simple <lb/>
            parts, the hand, for example, of flesh, and sinew, and bone. <lb/>
            Some animals have all these parts the same, in others they <lb/>
            are different from each other. Some of the parts are the <lb/>
            same in form, as the nose and eye of one man is the same as <lb/>
            the nose and eye of another man, and flesh is the same with <lb/>
            flesh, and bone with bone. In like manner we may compare <lb/>
            the parts of the horse, and of other animals, those parts, that <lb/>
            is, which are the same in species, for the whole bears the same <lb/>
            relation to the whole as the parts do to each other. And in <lb/>
            animals belonging to the same class, the parts are the same, <lb/>
            only they differ in excess or defect. By class, I mean such as <lb/>
            bird or fish, for all these differ if either compared with their <lb/>
            own class or with another, and there are many forms of <lb/>
            birds and fishes.</p>
          <p>3. Nearly all their parts differ in them according to the <lb/>
            opposition of their external qualities, such as colour or <lb/>
            shape, in that some are more, others are less affected, or <note type="footnote">B</note> <pb n="2"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. I.</note> <lb/>
            sometimes in number more or less, or in size greater and <lb/>
            smaller, or in any quality which can be included in excess <lb/>
            or defect. For some animals have a soft skin, in others the <lb/>
            skin is shelly; some have a long bill, as cranes, others a <lb/>
            short one; some have many feathers, others very few; some <lb/>
            also have parts which are wanting in others, for some species <lb/>
            have spurs, others have none; some have a crest, others have <lb/>
            not. But, so to say, their principal parts and those which <lb/>
            form the bulk of their body, are either the same, or vary <lb/>
            only in their opposites, and in excess and defect.</p>
          <p>4. By excess and defect I mean the greater and the less. <lb/>
            But some animals agree with each other in their parts neither <lb/>
            in form, nor in excess and defect, but have only an analogous <lb/>
            likeness, such as a bone bears to a spine, a nail to a hoof, <lb/>
            a hand to a crab's claw, the scale of a fish to the feather of <lb/>
            a bird, for that which is a feather in the birds is a scale in <lb/>
            the fish. With regard then to the parts which each class <lb/>
            of animal possesses, they agree and differ in this manner, <lb/>
            and also in the position of the parts. For many animals <lb/>
            have the same parts, but not in the same position, as the <lb/>
            mammæ which are either pectoral or abdominal. But of the <lb/>
            simple parts some are soft and moist, others hard and dry.</p>
          <p>5. The soft parts are either entirely so, or so long as they <lb/>
            are in a natural condition, as blood, serum, fat, tallow, mar­ <lb/>
            row, semen, gall, milk (in those animals which give milk), <lb/>
            flesh, and other analogous parts of the body. In another <lb/>
            manner also the excretions of the body belong to this class, <lb/>
            as phlegm, and the excrements of the abdomen and bladder; <lb/>
            the hard and dry parts are sinew, skin, vein, hair, bone, car­ <lb/>
            tilage, nail, horn, for that part bears the same name, and on <lb/>
            the whole is called horn, and the other parts of the body <lb/>
            which are analogous to these.</p>
          <p>6. Animals also differ in their manner of life, in their ac­ <lb/>
            tions and dispositions, and in their parts. We will first of <lb/>
            all speak generally of these differences, and afterwards con­ <lb/>
            sider each species separately. The following are the points <lb/>
            in which they vary in manner of life, in their actions and <lb/>
            dispositions. Some animals are aquatic, others live on the <lb/>
            land; and the aquatic may again be divided into two classes, <lb/>
            for some entirely exist and procure their food in the water, <lb/>
            and take in and give out water, and cannot live without it ; <pb n="3"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. I.] </note> <lb/>
            this is the nature of most fishes. But there are others <lb/>
            which, though they live and feed in the water, do not take <lb/>
            in water but air, and produce their young out of the water. <lb/>
            Many of these animals are furnished with feet, as the otter <lb/>
            and the latax1 and the crocodile, or with wings, as the seagull <lb/>
            and diver, and others are without feet, as the water-serpent. <lb/>
            Some procure their food from the water, and cannot live out <lb/>
            of the water, but neither inhale air nor water, as the acalephe2 <lb/>
            and the oyster.</p>
          <p>7. Different aquatic animals are found in the sea, in rivers, <lb/>
            in lakes, and in marshes, as the frog and newt, and of <lb/>
            marine animals some are pelagic, some littoral, and some <lb/>
            saxatile. Some land animals take in and give out air, and <lb/>
            this is called inhaling and exhaling; such are man, and all <lb/>
            other land animals which are furnished with lungs; some, <lb/>
            however, which procure their food from the earth, do not <lb/>
            inhale air, as the wasp, the bee, and all other insects.3 By <lb/>
            insects I mean those animals which have divisions in their <lb/>
            bodies, whether in the lower part only, or both in the upper <lb/>
            and lower. Many land animals, as I have already observed, <lb/>
            procure their food from the water, but there are no aquatic or <lb/>
            marine animals which find their food on land. There are <lb/>
            some animals which at first inhabit the water, but afterwards <lb/>
            change into a different form, and live out of the water ; this <lb/>
            happens to the gnat in the rivers, and 4 which <lb/>
            afterwards becomes an œstrum.5</p>
          <p>8. Again, there are some creatures which are stationary, <lb/>
            while others are locomotive; the fixed animals are aquatic, <lb/>
            but this is not the case with any of the inhabitants of the <lb/>
            land. Many aquatic animals also grow upon each other; <lb/>
            this is the case with several genera of shell-fish: the sponge <lb/>
            also exhibits some signs of sensation, for they say that it is <lb/>
            drawn up with some difficulty, unless the attempt to remove <lb/>
            it is made stealthily. Other animals also there are which <lb/>
            are alternately fixed together or free, this is the case with a <lb/>
            certain kind of acalephe; some of these become separated <lb/>
            during the night, and emigrate. Many animals are separate <lb/>
            from each other, but incapable of voluntary movement, as <note type="footnote">1 Beaver,Castor fiber. 2 Medusa, or perhaps Actinia, or both.</note><note type="footnote">3 Under the class <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕντομα</foreign> are probably included all annulose animals.</note><note type="footnote">4 Some words appear to be lost in this place. 5 Tabanus,gad fly.</note> <note type="footnote">B 2</note> <pb n="4"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. I. </note> <lb/>
            oysters, and the animal called holothuria.1 Some aquatic <lb/>
            animals are swimmers, as fish, and the mollusca,2 and the <lb/>
            malacostraca, as the crabs. Others creep on the bottom, as <lb/>
            the crab, for this, though an aquatic animal, naturally creeps.</p>
          <p>9. Of land animals some are furnished with wings, as birds <lb/>
            and bees, and these differ in other respects from each other; <lb/>
            others have feet, and of this class some species walk, others <lb/>
            crawl, and others creep in the mud. There is no animal which <lb/>
            has only wings as fish have only fins, for those animals whose <lb/>
            wings are formed by an expansion of the skin can walk, <lb/>
            and the bat has feet, the seal has imperfect feet. Among <lb/>
            birds there are some with very imperfect feet, which are <lb/>
            therefore called apodes; they are, however, provided with <lb/>
            very strong wings, and almost all birds that are similar to <lb/>
            this one have strong wings and imperfect feet, as the swallow <lb/>
            and drepanis ;3 for all this class of birds is alike both in ha­ <lb/>
            bits and in the structure of their wings, and their whole <lb/>
            appearance is very similar. The apos4 is seen at all times <lb/>
            of the year, but the drepanis can only be taken in rainy <lb/>
            weather during the summer, and on the whole is a rare bird.</p>
          <p>10. Many animals, however, can both walk and swim. <lb/>
            The following are the differences exhibited by animals in <lb/>
            their habits and their actions. Some of them are gregarious, <lb/>
            and others solitary, both in the classes which are furnished <lb/>
            with feet, and those which have wings, or fins. Some partake <lb/>
            of both characters, and of those that are gregarious, as well <lb/>
            as those that are solitary, some unite in societies and some <lb/>
            are scattered. Gregarious birds are such as the pigeon, <lb/>
            stork, swan, but no bird with hooked claws is gregarious. <lb/>
            Among swimming animals some fish are gregarious, as the <lb/>
            dromas,5 tunny, pelalnis,6 amia.7</p>
          <p>11. But man partakes of both qualities. Those which <lb/>
            have a common employment are called social, but that is <lb/>
            not the case with all gregarious animals. Man, and the <lb/>
            bee, the wasp, and the ant, and the stork belong to this <lb/>
            class. Some of these obey a leader, others are anarchical; <lb/>
            the stork and the bee are of the former class, the ant and <lb/>
            many others belong to the latter. Some animals, both in <note type="footnote">' Perhaps some species of Zoophyte. </note><note type="footnote">2 Cephalopods. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Perhaps Sand martin. </note><note type="footnote">4 Swift. </note><note type="footnote">5 Some migratory fish. </note><note type="footnote"> 6 A kind of tunny, still called palamyde at Marseilles. </note><note type="footnote"> 7 A kind of tunny, Les Bonitons (Camus.) </note> <pb n="5"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. I.] </note> <lb/>
            the gregarious and solitary class, are limited to one locality, <lb/>
            others are migratory. There are also carnivorous animals, <lb/>
            herbivorous, omnivorous, and others which eat peculiar <lb/>
            food, as the bee and the spider; the former eats only honey <lb/>
            and a few other sweet things, while spiders prey upon flies <lb/>
            and there are other animals which feed entirely on fish. Some <lb/>
            animals hunt for their food, and some make a store, which <lb/>
            others do not. There are also animals which make habita­ <lb/>
            tions for themselves, and others which do not. The mole, <lb/>
            the mouse, the ant, and the bee, make habitations, but many <lb/>
            kinds both of insects and quadrupeds make no dwelling.</p>
          <p>12. With regard to situation, some are troglodite, as lizards <lb/>
            and serpents, others, as the horse and dog, live upon the sur­ <lb/>
            face of the earth. Some kinds of animals burrow in the <lb/>
            ground, others do not; some animals are nocturnal, as the owl <lb/>
            and the bat, others use the hours of daylight. There are <lb/>
            tame animals and wild animals. Man and the mule are al­ <lb/>
            ways tame, the leopard and the wolf are invariably wild, and <lb/>
            others, as the elephant, are easily tamed. We may, however, <lb/>
            view them in another way, for all the genera that have been <lb/>
            tamed are found wild also, as horses, oxen, swine, sheep, <lb/>
            goats, and dogs.</p>
          <p>13. Some animals utter a loud cry, some are silent, and <lb/>
            others have a voice, which in some cases may be expressed <lb/>
            by a word, in others it cannot. There are also noisy <lb/>
            animals and silent animals, musical and unmusical kinds, <lb/>
            but they are mostly noisy about the breeding season. Some, <lb/>
            as the dove, frequent fields, others, as the hoopoe, live <lb/>
            on the mountains; some attach themselves to man, as the <lb/>
            pigeon. Some are lascivious, as the partridge and domestic <lb/>
            fowl, and others are chaste, as the raven, which rarely <lb/>
            cohabits.</p>
          <p>14. Again, there are classes of animals furnished with <lb/>
            weapons of offence, others with weapons of defence ; in the <lb/>
            former I include those which are capable of inflicting an in­ <lb/>
            jury, or of defending themselves when they are attacked; in <lb/>
            the latter those which are provided with some natural pro­ <lb/>
            tection against injury.</p>
          <p>15. Animals also exhibit many differences of disposition. <lb/>
            Some are gentle, peaceful, and not violent, as the ox. Some <lb/>
            are violent, passionate, and intractable, as the wild boar. Some <pb n="6"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. I. </note> <lb/>
            are prudent and fearful, as the stag and the hare. Serpents <lb/>
            are illiberal and crafty. Others, as the lion, are liberal, <lb/>
            noble, and generous. Others are brave, wild, and crafty, <lb/>
            like the wolf. For there is this difference between the <lb/>
            generous and the brave-the former means that which comes <lb/>
            of a noble race, the latter that which does not easily depart <lb/>
            from its own nature.</p>
          <p>16. Some animals are cunning and evil-disposed, as the <lb/>
            fox; others, as the dog, are fierce, friendly, and fawning. <lb/>
            Some are gentle and easily tamed, as the elephant; some are <lb/>
            susceptible of shame, and watchful, as the goose. Some <lb/>
            are jealous, and fond of ornament, as the peacock. But man <lb/>
            is the only animal capable of reasoning, though many <lb/>
            others possess the faculty of memory and instruction in <lb/>
            common with him. No other animal but man has the power <lb/>
            of recollection. In another place we will treat more accu­ <lb/>
            rately of the disposition and manner of life in each class.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>1. ALL animals possess in common those parts by which they <lb/>
            take in food, and into which they receive it. But these <lb/>
            parts agree or differ in the same way as all the other parts <lb/>
            of bodies, that is, either in shape or size, or proportion or <lb/>
            position; and besides these, almost all animals possess many <lb/>
            other parts in common, such as those by which they reject <lb/>
            their excrements, (and the part by wThich they take their <lb/>
            food,)1 though this does not exist in all. The part by which <lb/>
            the food is taken in is called the mouth, that which receives <lb/>
            the food from the mouth is called the stomach. The part <lb/>
            by which they reject the excrement has many names.</p>
          <p>2. The excrement being of two kinds, the animals which <lb/>
            possess receptacles for the fluid excrement have also recepta­ <lb/>
            cles for the dry; but those which have the latter are not <lb/>
            always furnished with the former. Wherefore all animals <lb/>
            which have a bladder have a belly also, but not all that have <lb/>
            a belly have a bladder; for the part appropriated to the <lb/>
            reception of the liquid excrement is called the bladder, and <lb/>
            that for the reception of the dry is called the belly.</p>
          <p>3. Many animals possess both these parts, and that also <lb/>
            by which the semen is emitted. Among animals that have <lb/>
            the power of generation, some emit the semen into them. <note type="footnote"> 1 The words in brachets should probably be excluded from the text. </note> <pb n="7"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. I.] </note> <lb/>
            selves, and some inject it into others. The former are <lb/>
            called female, the latter male. In some animals there is <lb/>
            neither male nor female, and there is a diversity in the form <lb/>
            of the parts appropriated to this office. For some animals <lb/>
            have a uterus, others have only something analogous to the <lb/>
            uterus. These are the most essential organs; some of <lb/>
            which exist in all animals, others in the majority only.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER III.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. THERE is only one sense, that of touch, which is common <lb/>
            to all animals; so that no exact name can be given to the <lb/>
            part in which this sense resides, for in some animals it is <lb/>
            the same, in others only analogous.</p>
          <p>2. Every living creature is furnished with moisture, and <lb/>
            must die, if deprived of this moisture either in the course <lb/>
            of nature or by force. But in what part of the body this <lb/>
            moisture resides is another question. In some animals it is <lb/>
            found in the blood and veins, in others the situation is only <lb/>
            analogous, but these are imperfect, as fibres and serum.1 The <lb/>
            sense of touch resides in the simple parts, as in the flesh and <lb/>
            in similar places, and generally in those parts which contain <lb/>
            blood, at least in those animals which have blood; in others <lb/>
            it resides in the analogous parts, but in all animals in the <lb/>
            simple parts.</p>
          <p>3. The capacity of action resides in the compound parts, <lb/>
            as the preparation of food in the mouth, and the power of <lb/>
            locomotion in the feet or wings, or the analogous parts. <lb/>
            Again, some animals are sanguineous, as man, the horse, and <lb/>
            all perfect animals, whether apodous, bipeds, or quadrupeds; <lb/>
            and some animals are without blood, as the bee and the <lb/>
            wasp, and such marine animals as the sepia and the carabus, <lb/>
            and all animals with more than four legs.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER IV.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. THERE are also viviparous, oviparous, and vermiparous <lb/>
            animals. The viviparous, are such as man, and the horse, the <lb/>
            seal, and others which have hair, and among marine animals <lb/>
            the cetacea, as the dolphin and those which are called selache.' <note type="footnote">1 Fibres and serum, as compared with veins and blood, refer to the <lb/>
            circulation in animals without red blood. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Palinurus, Spiny Lobster. </note><note type="footnote">3 Cartilaginous fishes. </note> <pb n="8"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. I. </note> <lb/>
            Some of these are furnished with a blow-hole, but have no <lb/>
            gills, as the dolphin and the whale. The dolphin has its <lb/>
            blow-hole on the back, the whale in its forehead; others <lb/>
            have open gills, as the selache, the galeus,l and the batus.2 <lb/>
            That is called the egg of the perfect foetus, from which the <lb/>
            future animal is produced, from a part at first, while the <lb/>
            remainder serves for its food. The worm is that from the <lb/>
            whole of which the future animal is produced, and the <lb/>
            foetus afterwards acquires parts and increases in size.</p>
          <p>2. Some viviparous animals are internally oviparous, as <lb/>
            the selache; others are internally viviparous, as mankind <lb/>
            and the horse. In different animals the foetus assumes a <lb/>
            different form, when first brought into the world, and is <lb/>
            either a living creature, an egg, or a worm. The eggs of <lb/>
            some animals, as birds, are hard-shelled, and are of two <lb/>
            colours. Those of the selache and some other animals are <lb/>
            soft-skinned, and have only one colour. Some species of the <lb/>
            vermiform foetus are capable of motion, others are not. But <lb/>
            in another place, when we treat of generation, we will dwell <lb/>
            more accurately on these subjects.</p>

          <p>1. SOME animals have feet, others have none; of the for­ <lb/>
            mer some have two feet, as mankind and birds only; others <lb/>
            have four, as the lizard and the dog ; others, as the scolopen­ <lb/>
            dra and bee, have many feet; but all have their feet in pairs.</p>
          <p>2. And among apodous swimming animals some have <lb/>
            fins, as fish ; and of these some have two fins in the upper <lb/>
            and two in the lower part of their bodies, as the chryso­ <lb/>
            phys3 and labrax ;4 others, which are very long and smooth, <lb/>
            have only two fins, as the eel and conger; others have none <lb/>
            at all, as the lamprey and others, which live in the sea as <lb/>
            serpents do on land, and in like manner swim in moist places; <lb/>
            and some of the genus selache, as those which are flat and <lb/>
            have tails, as the batos and trygon, have no fins; these fish <lb/>
            swim by means of their flat surfaces; but the batrachus5has <lb/>
            fins, and so have all those fish which are not very thin in pro­ <lb/>
            portion to their width.</p>
          <p>3. But the animals which have apparent feet, as the cepha- <note type="footnote"/><note type="footnote">1 Squalus galeus. </note><note type="footnote">2 Raia batos. </note><note type="footnote">3 Sparus auratus. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Perea labrax. </note><note type="footnote">a Lophius piscatorius and also L. barbatus. </note> <pb n="9"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. I.] </note> <lb/>
            lopods, swim both with their feet and fins, and move quickly <lb/>
            upon the hollow parts of their bodies, as the sepia, teuthis, <lb/>
            and polypus: but none of them can walk except the polypus. <lb/>
            Those animals which have hard skins, as the carabus, swim <lb/>
            with their hinder parts, and move very quickly upon their <lb/>
            tail, with the fins which are upon it, and the newt both with <lb/>
            its feet and tail, and (to compare small things with great) it <lb/>
            has a tail like the glanis.1</p>
          <p>4. Some winged animals, as the eagle and the hawk, are <lb/>
            feathered; others, as the cockchafer and the bee, mem­ <lb/>
            branaceous wings ; and others, as the alopex2 and the bat, <lb/>
            have wings formed of skin. Both the feathered and leather- <lb/>
            winged tribes have blood; but the insects, which have naked <lb/>
            wings, have no blood. Again, the feathered and leather- <lb/>
            winged animals are all either bipeds or apodous, for they say <lb/>
            that there are winged serpents in Ethiopia.3</p>
          <p>5. The feathered tribe of animals is called birds; the other <lb/>
            two tribes have no exact names. Among winged creatures <lb/>
            without blood some are coleopterous, for they have elytra <lb/>
            over their wings, as the cockchafer and the beetles, and others <lb/>
            are without elytra. The animals of this class have either <lb/>
            two or four wings. Those with four wings are distin­ <lb/>
            guished by their greater size or a caudal sting. The diptera <lb/>
            are either such as are small, or have a sting in their bead. <lb/>
            The coleoptera have no sting at all; the diptera have a sting <lb/>
            in their head, as the fly, horse-fly, gad-fly, and gnat.</p>
          <p>6. All bloodless animals, except a few marine species of <lb/>
            the cephalopoda, are smaller than those which have blood. <lb/>
            These animals are the largest in warm waters, and more so <lb/>
            in the sea than on the land, and in fresh water. All creatures <lb/>
            that are capable of motion are moved by four or more limbs. <lb/>
            Those with blood have four limbs only, as man has two <lb/>
            hands and two feet. Birds have two wings and two feet; <lb/>
            quadrupeds and fishes have four feet or four fins. But those <lb/>
            animals which have two wings or none at all, as the serpent, <lb/>
            are nevertheless moved by four limbs; for the bendings of <lb/>
            their body are four in number, or two when they have two <lb/>
            wings. <note type="footnote">1 Silurus glanis, L. (Strack). </note><note type="footnote">2 Probably some kind of flying squirrel. </note><note type="footnote">a Herodotus, ii. 76 : " the form of this serpent is similar to that of the water-snake; its wings are not feathered, but like those of <lb/>
            bats :" the draco volans may have given rise to this story. </note> <pb n="10"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. I. </note> </p>
          <p>7. Those bloodless animals which have more than four <lb/>
            feet, whether furnished with feet or wings, always have more <lb/>
            than four organs of locomotion, as the ephemera, which has <lb/>
            four feet and four wings ; and in this it not only agrees with <lb/>
            its peculiar manner of life, from which also it derives <lb/>
            its name, but also that it is winged and four-footed; and <lb/>
            all creatures, whether they have four feet or many feet, <lb/>
            move in the same direction, for they all move in the long <lb/>
            way of their bodies. All other animals have two leading <lb/>
            feet, the crab alone has four.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>1. THE following are the principal classes which include other <lb/>
            animals-birds, fishes, cetacea. All these have red blood. <lb/>
            There is another class of animals covered with a shell, and <lb/>
            called shell fish, and an anonymous class of soft-shelled <lb/>
            animals (malacostraca), which includes carabi, carcini, and <lb/>
            astaci; and another of mollusca, such as teuthis, teuthos, and <lb/>
            sepia; and another class of annulose animals. All these are <lb/>
            without blood, and the species with feet have many feet. <lb/>
            There are no large classes of other animals; for there are <lb/>
            many forms which are not included under a single form, but <lb/>
            either stand alone, having no specific difference, as man, or <lb/>
            have specific differences, but the classes are anonymous.</p>
          <p>2. All animals with four feet and no wings have blood. <lb/>
            Some of these are viviparous, others oviparous. The vivi­ <lb/>
            parous are not all covered with hair, but the oviparous have <lb/>
            scales. The scale of a reptile is similar in situation to the <lb/>
            scale of a fish. The class of serpents, sanguineous land ani­ <lb/>
            mals, is naturally without feet. Though some have feet, this <lb/>
            class is also covered with scales. All serpents, except the <lb/>
            viper, are oviparous. The viper alone is viviparous, so that <lb/>
            not all viviparous animals have hair; for some fishes also are <lb/>
            viviparous. All animals, however, that have hair are vivi­ <lb/>
            parous ; for we may consider the prickles of the hedgehog <lb/>
            and porcupine as analogous to the hair of animals ; for they <lb/>
            answer the purpose of hair, and not, as in marine animals <lb/>
            that are so covered, of feet.1</p>
          <p>3. There are also many classes of viviparous quadrupeds, <note type="footnote">1 The Echinidæ.</note> <pb n="11"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. I.] </note> <lb/>
            but they have never received names. Each kind must, <lb/>
            therefore, be taken separately, as man, as we speak of lion, <lb/>
            stag, horse, dog, and of others in like manner. There is, <lb/>
            however, one class of those that have a mane called lopburi,l <lb/>
            as the horse, ass, mule, ginnus,2 hinnus, and those which in <lb/>
            Syria are called mules, from their resemblance, though not <lb/>
            quite of the same form. They copulate and produce young <lb/>
            from each other, so that it is necessary to consider well the <lb/>
            nature of each of them separately.</p>
          <p>4. We have now treated of these things in an outline, for <lb/>
            the sake of giving a taste of what we are afterwards to <lb/>
            consider, and of how many. Hereafter we will speak of them <lb/>
            more accurately, in order that we may first of all examine <lb/>
            into their points of difference and agreement; and after­ <lb/>
            wards we will endeavour to inquire into the causes of <lb/>
            these things, but it will be a more natural arrangement to <lb/>
            do so when we treat of the history of each. For it is evident <lb/>
            from these things what they are, and what we have to de­ <lb/>
            monstrate.</p>
          <p>5. Our first subject of consideration must be the parts of <lb/>
            which animals are made up, for these constitute the chief <lb/>
            and the whole difference among them ; either because they <lb/>
            have them or are without them, or these parts vary in posi­ <lb/>
            tion or arrangement, or in any of the differences mentioned <lb/>
            before, in form, size, proportion, and difference of accidents. <lb/>
            First of all, then, we will consider the parts of the human <lb/>
            body; for, as every one can best understand the standard of <lb/>
            money with which he is most familiar, so it is in other things. <lb/>
            And of necessity, man must be the best known to us of all <lb/>
            animals. The parts of the body are, indeed, plain enough to <lb/>
            every one's common sense; but, that we may not forsake our <lb/>
            arrangement, and may have reason as well as perception, we <lb/>
            will speak, first of all, of the organic, and afterwards of the <lb/>
            simple, parts.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER VII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. THESE are the principal parts into which the whole body is <lb/>
            divided. The head, neck, trunk, two arms, and two legs, <note type="footnote">1 Animals with long hair on their tails.</note><note type="footnote">2 Ginnus is the offspring of a mule and mare. Book vi. 24, 1.</note><note type="footnote">3 Hemionus, perhaps the foal of a horse and wild ass, and so dis­ tinct from oreus, the foal of the he-ass and mare.</note> <pb n="12"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. I. </note> <lb/>
            The whole cavity, from the neck to the pudenda, is called <lb/>
            the trunk. That part of the head which is covered with <lb/>
            hair is called the cranium, the fore part of this is called the <lb/>
            sinciput. This is the last formed, being the last bone in <lb/>
            the body which becomes hard; the hinder part is the occi­ <lb/>
            put, and between the occiput and sinciput is the crown of <lb/>
            the head. The brain is placed beneath the sinciput, and the <lb/>
            occiput is empty ;1 the cranium is a thin spherical bone covered <lb/>
            with a skin without flesh. The skull has sutures : in women <lb/>
            there is but one placed in a circle ; men have generally three <lb/>
            joined in one, and a man's skull has been seen without any <lb/>
            sutures at all. The middle and smooth part of the hair is <lb/>
            called the crown of the head; in some persons this is double, <lb/>
            for there are some people double-crowned, not from any for­ <lb/>
            mation of the bone, but only from the division of the hair.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER VIlI.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. THE part immediately beneath the cranium is called the <lb/>
            face in mankind alone, for we do not speak of the face of a fish <lb/>
            or of an ox; the part immediately beneath the sinciput and <lb/>
            between the eyes is called the forehead. Those in whom <lb/>
            this feature is large are tardy ; those who have a small fore­ <lb/>
            head are easily excited; a broad forehead belongs to those <lb/>
            who are liable to be carried away by their feelings; a round <lb/>
            forehead is a sign of a passionate disposition.</p>
          <p>2. Under the forehead are two eyebrows; if they are <lb/>
            straight, it is a mark of a gentle disposition ; the eyebrows <lb/>
            bent down to the nose are an evidence of an austere tem­ <lb/>
            per ; if they incline towards the temples, of a mocker and <lb/>
            scoffer; if they are drawn down, it is a sign of an envious <lb/>
            person. Beneath these are the eyes, which by nature are two <lb/>
            in number: the parts of each eye are, first, the upper and under <lb/>
            eyelid, the edges of which are furnished with hair. Within <lb/>
            the eye, the moist part with which we see is called the pupil; <lb/>
            round this is the iris, and this is surrounded by the white. <lb/>
            Two corners of the eye are formed at the junction of the eye­ <lb/>
            lids, one in the direction of the nose, the other towards the <lb/>
            temple. If these corners are large, they are a sign of an evil <lb/>
            disposition; if those near the nose are fleshy, and have a <lb/>
            swollen appearance, they are an evidence of wickedness. <note type="footnote"> 1 This mistake is again repeated in Ch. xiii. </note> <pb n="13"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. I.] </note> </p>
          <p>3. All other classes of animals have eyes, except shell-fish, <lb/>
            and some other imperfect creatures, and all viviparous <lb/>
            animals except moles have eyes. A person might, however, <lb/>
            conclude from the following observation, that it has eyes, <lb/>
            though it is quite without them, for it certainly does not <lb/>
            see at all, nor has it any external eyes; but, when the skin is <lb/>
            taken off, there is a place for the eyes, and the iris of the <lb/>
            eye is in the place which it would naturally occupy on the <lb/>
            outside, as if they had been wounded in their birth, and the <lb/>
            skin had grown over the place.</p>
          <p>4. The white of the eye is generally the same in all animals, <lb/>
            but the iris is very different. In some it is black, in others <lb/>
            decidedly grey, in others dark grey, and in some it is the <lb/>
            colour of the goat's eye, and this is a sign of the best dis­ <lb/>
            position, and is most to be prized for acuteness of vision. <lb/>
            Man is almost the only animal which exhibits a variety of <lb/>
            colouring in the eye; there are, however, some horses with <lb/>
            grey eyes.</p>
          <p>5. The eyes of some persons are large, others small, and <lb/>
            others of a moderate size-the last-mentioned are the best. <lb/>
            And some eyes are projecting, some deep-set, and some mo­ <lb/>
            derate, and those which are deep-set have the most acute <lb/>
            vision in all animals; the middle position is a sign of the <lb/>
            best disposition. Some people have an eye which is perpe­ <lb/>
            tually opening and closing, others have an eye always intent, <lb/>
            and others a moderately-intent eye : this last is the best dis­ <lb/>
            posed ; of the others, the one is impudent, and the other a <lb/>
            sign of infirmity.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>1. THE part of the head by which we hear, but do not breathe, <lb/>
            is the ear; for Alcmæon is mistaken when he says that <lb/>
            goats breathe through their ears. One part of the ear has not <lb/>
            received any name, the other part is called the lobe. The <lb/>
            whole ear is made up of cartilage and flesh. Internally, <lb/>
            the ear has the nature of a shell, and the last bone is simi­ <lb/>
            lar to the ear itself. The sound reaches this part last, as <lb/>
            it were in a chamber. There is no passage from the ear into <lb/>
            the brain, but there is to the roof of the mouth ; and a vein <lb/>
            extends from the brain to each ear.1 The eyes also are con. <lb/>
            nected with the brain, and each eye is placed upon a vein. <note type="footnote"> 1 Eustachian tube. </note> <pb n="14"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. I. </note> </p>
          <p>2. Man is the only animal with ears that cannot move them. <lb/>
            Among animals which have the faculty of hearing; some have <lb/>
            ears, and others, as winged and scaly creatures, have no ear, <lb/>
            but an open orifice in the head ; all viviparous animals, except <lb/>
            the seal, and the dolphin, and other cetacea, have ears ; the <lb/>
            selache also are viviparous. The seal has open orifices by <lb/>
            which it hears ; the dolphin can hear, though it has no ears; <lb/>
            all other animals can move their ears, but man alone does <lb/>
            not move them.</p>
          <p>3. The ears (of man) lie in the same circle with his eyes, <lb/>
            and not above them, as in some quadrupeds. The ears are <lb/>
            either smooth, hairy, or moderate. These last are the best <lb/>
            for hearing, but they do not in any way indicate the dis­ <lb/>
            position. They are large, or small or middling, or they are <lb/>
            erect, or not at all, or only moderately erect. The moderately <lb/>
            erect are a sign of the best disposition; large and erect ears <lb/>
            are an evidence of foolish talking and loquacity. The part <lb/>
            of the head between the eye and the ear is called the temple.</p>
          <p>4. In the middle of the face is the nose, the passage for the <lb/>
            breath, for through this animals inhale and exhale, and <lb/>
            through it also they sneeze; this is the expulsion of a con­ <lb/>
            centrated breath, and is the only kind of breathing which is <lb/>
            esteemed ominous or sacred: moreover, inhaling and exhal­ <lb/>
            ing is into the chest, and without the nostrils it is impossible <lb/>
            to inhale or exhale, for inhaling and exhaling is from the <lb/>
            breast by the windpipe, and not from any part of the head. <lb/>
            But it is possible to live without this respiration through the <lb/>
            nostrils. The smell also resides in this part; this is the sense <lb/>
            of odour. The nostril is very moveable, and not naturally <lb/>
            immoveable like the ear.</p>
          <p>5. One part of the nose, namely, the division between the <lb/>
            nostrils, is cartilaginous, but the passage is empty, for the <lb/>
            nose is formed of two divisions. In the elephant, the nostril <lb/>
            is very large and strong, and it answers to the purpose of a <lb/>
            hand, for the animal can extend it, and with it take its food, <lb/>
            and convey it to its mouth, whether the food is moist or dry. <lb/>
            This is the only animal that can do so.</p>
          <p>6. There are also two jaws, the upper and the under. All <lb/>
            animals move the lower jaw, except the river-crocodile, and <lb/>
            this moves the upper jaw only. Below the nose are two lips, <lb/>
            the flesh of which is very moveable. The mouth is the <pb n="15"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. I.] </note> <lb/>
            centre of the jaws and the lips. The upper part is called <lb/>
            the roof of the mouth, the lower, the pharynx. The tongue <lb/>
            is the organ of taste. This sense resides in the tip, and, if <lb/>
            food is placed on the broad part of the tongue, the taste is <lb/>
            less acute. The tongue partakes of all the other sensations, <lb/>
            as harshness, heat, and cold, as well as that of taste, in com­ <lb/>
            mon with the rest of the flesh.</p>
          <p>7. The flat part of the tongue is either narrow or moderate <lb/>
            in size, the moderate is the best, and most apt for clear elocu­ <lb/>
            tion. The tongue may be either too loose, or tied down, as in <lb/>
            stammerers and inarticulate speakers. The flesh of the <lb/>
            tongue is porous and spongy. The epiglottis is a portion <lb/>
            of the tongue, the double part of the mouth is the tonsils ; <lb/>
            that in many divisions the gums, they are fleshy, and in <lb/>
            them are fixed the bony teeth. Within the mouth there is <lb/>
            another part, the uvula, a pillar filled with blood. If this part <lb/>
            is swelled with relaxation, it is called a grape, and chokes.</p>

          <p>1. THE neck is the part between the head and the trunk ; the <lb/>
            front part is called the larynx, behind this is the oesophagus. <lb/>
            The voice and the breath pass through the front part, the <lb/>
            trachea, which is cartilaginous, but the oesophagus is fleshy, <lb/>
            and placed farther in, near the vertebra of the neck. The <lb/>
            back of the neck is called the epomis. These are the parts <lb/>
            as far as the thorax. The parts of the thorax are some be­ <lb/>
            fore and some behind. First of all, below the neck is the <lb/>
            breast with two mammæ ; on these are two nipples, through <lb/>
            which the milk of the female passes. The mamma is porous. <lb/>
            There is also milk in the breasts of men. The flesh of the <lb/>
            mamma in men is thick, in women it is spongy and full of pores.</p>
          <p>2. The part below the thorax, in front, is the belly, and at <lb/>
            this the navel is the centre. Beneath this centre, the part on <lb/>
            each side is called the iliac region ; the part in the centre, be­ <lb/>
            neath the navel, is called the hypogastric region ; the lowest <lb/>
            part of this is called pubes; above the navel is the epigas­ <lb/>
            tric region ; the lumbar region is situated between the epi­ <lb/>
            gastric and iliac regions.</p>
          <p>3. Of the hinder parts the loin forms the division of the <lb/>
            body, whence also its name is derived (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀσϕύς</foreign> quasi <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰσοϕύς</foreign>). <lb/>
            The part of the central region which is like a seat is the but- <pb n="16"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. I.</note> <lb/>
            tock ; that on which the thigh turns, the cotyledon. The <lb/>
            peculiar part of women is the uterus ; of men the penis, it <lb/>
            is external, at the extremity of the trunk in two parts ; the <lb/>
            upper part is fleshy and smooth, and is called glans; this is <lb/>
            covered with an anonymous skin, which, if it is cut asunder, <lb/>
            does not unite again, neither does the cheek nor the eyelid.</p>
          <p>4. Common to this and the glans is the prepuce, the re­ <lb/>
            maining part is cartilaginous, readily increases in size, and <lb/>
            it is drawn in and out, contrary to that of the class of ani­ <lb/>
            mals called lophuri. Beneath the penis are two testicles, <lb/>
            surrounded by a skin called the scrotum ; the testicles are <lb/>
            not of the same nature as flesh, nor are they made of flesh. <lb/>
            In another place we shall treat of the nature of all these <lb/>
            parts more accurately.</p>
          <p>5. The pudendum muliebre is contrary to that of the <lb/>
            male, for it is hollow under the pubes, not projecting like <lb/>
            that of the male, and the urethra is outside the womb, for the <lb/>
            passage of the semen of the male, and for the fluid excre­ <lb/>
            ment of both. The part of the body which joins the neck and <lb/>
            the breast is called the jugulum; that which unites the side, <lb/>
            the arm, and the shoulder is the arm-pit. The region <lb/>
            between the thigh and the hypogastric region is called the <lb/>
            groin; the part common to the thigh and the buttock on the <lb/>
            inside is the perineum, that of the thigh and buttock on the <lb/>
            outside is called hypoglutis.</p>
          <p>6. We have previously treated of the trunk. The hinder <lb/>
            part of the breast is called the back : the parts of the back <lb/>
            are two shoulder blades and the back-bone ; below the thorax, <lb/>
            and opposite the stomach, are the loins; the ribs belong <lb/>
            both to the back and the front of the trunk, and are eight <lb/>
            on each side, for we have never heard anything worthy of <lb/>
            credit concerning the Ligyes, who are said to have seven ribs.</p>

          <p>1. MAN has upper and lower side, the front and the back, and <lb/>
            right and left side. The right and the left are nearly alike in <lb/>
            their parts and in every particular, except that the left side <lb/>
            is the weaker; but the back parts are not like the front; <lb/>
            nor the lower parts to the upper, except in this particular, <lb/>
            that the parts below the hypogastric region are full-fleshed <lb/>
            or lean in proportion to the face, and the arms also answer <pb n="17"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. I.] </note> <lb/>
            to the proportion of the legs. Those persons who have a <lb/>
            short humerus have also generally a short thigh: those who <lb/>
            have small feet have also small hands.</p>
          <p>2. One of the double parts of the body is the arm. The parts <lb/>
            of the arm are the shoulder, humerus, elbow, cubitus, and the <lb/>
            hand ; the parts of the hand are the palm and five fingers ; the <lb/>
            jointed part of the finger is the condyle, the unjointed part <lb/>
            the phalanx. The thumb has but one joint, all the rest have <lb/>
            two. The bending of the arm and finger is always inwards. <lb/>
            The arm is also bent at the elbow: the inner part of <lb/>
            the hand is called the palm; it is fleshy, and divided <lb/>
            by strong lines. Long-lived persons have one or two lines <lb/>
            which extend through the whole band ; short-lived persons <lb/>
            have two lines not extending through the whole hand. The <lb/>
            joint of the hand and arm is the wrist. The outside of the <lb/>
            nand is sinewy, and has not received any name.</p>
          <p>3. The other double part of the body is the leg. The <lb/>
            double-headed part of the leg is called the thigh, the move­ <lb/>
            able part is called the patella, that which has two bones <lb/>
            the tibia; the front of this part is the shin, the hind part <lb/>
            the calf of the leg. The flesh is full of sinews and veins ; in <lb/>
            those persons who have large hips, the flesh is drawn up­ <lb/>
            wards towards the hollow part under the knee, in those who <lb/>
            have not it is drawn down. The lowest part of the shin is <lb/>
            the ankle, and this is double in each leg. The part of the <lb/>
            leg with many bones is called the foot, the hind part of which <lb/>
            is the heel. The front part is divided into five toes ; the <lb/>
            under part, which is fleshy, is called the sole of the foot; <lb/>
            the upper part, (the instep,) is sinewy, and has not re­ <lb/>
            ceived any name. One part of the toe is the nail, the other <lb/>
            is the joint; the nail is on the extremity of the toe, and the <lb/>
            toes are bent inwards. Those who have the sole of the foot <lb/>
            thick, and not hollow, but walk upon the whole of the foot, <lb/>
            are knavish. The common joint of the thigh and the leg is <lb/>
            the knee.</p>

          <p>1. THESE parts are possessed in common by the male and fe­ <lb/>
            male ; the position of the external parts, whether above or be­ <lb/>
            low, before or behind, on the right side or the left, will appear <lb/>
            on mere inspection. It is necessary, however, to enumerate <lb/>
             <pb n="18"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. I. </note> <lb/>
            them, for the reasons which I have mentioned before, that <lb/>
            its proper place being assigned to each part, any difference in <lb/>
            their arrangement in man and other animals may be less <lb/>
            likely to escape our notice.</p>
          <p>2. In man, the parts of the body are more naturally di­ <lb/>
            vided into upper and lower than in any other animal, for all <lb/>
            the upper and lower parts of his body are arranged accord­ <lb/>
            ing to the order of nature above and below ; in the same <lb/>
            way, also, the fore and hind parts, and those on the right <lb/>
            and left, are placed naturally. But in other animals some <lb/>
            of these parts are either not at all so placed, or they are <lb/>
            much more confused than in man. The head is placed above <lb/>
            the body in all animals, but in man alone, as we have said, is <lb/>
            this part corresponding to the order of all things.</p>
          <p>3. Next to the head is the neck, then the breast and the <lb/>
            back, the one before and the other behind; and each of them <lb/>
            in the following order: — the stomach, loins, pudenda, <lb/>
            haunch, then the thigh and leg, and, last of all, the foot. <lb/>
            The legs have the joint bent forwards, in which direction <lb/>
            also is their manner of walking, and the more moveable par4. <lb/>
            of the legs as well as the joint is bent forward: the heel is be­ <lb/>
            hind. Each of the ankles is like an ear. From the right and <lb/>
            left side come arms, having the joint bent inwards, so that <lb/>
            the flexures both of the legs and arms are towards each other, <lb/>
            especially in man.</p>
          <p>4. The senses and the organs of sense, the eyes, nostril, <lb/>
            and tongue are in the same position, and in the anterior part <lb/>
            of the body; but the hearing, and its organ, and the ears are <lb/>
            at the side, and upon the same circumference as the eyes. <lb/>
            Man has the eyes closer together, in proportion to his size, <lb/>
            than other animals. The sense of touch is the most accurate <lb/>
            of the human senses, and next to this the taste. In the rest <lb/>
            of his senses he is far surpassed by other animals.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XIII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. THE external parts of the body are arranged in this <lb/>
            manner; and, as I have said, are for the most part named and <lb/>
            known from habit. But the internal parts are not so well <lb/>
            known, and those of the human body are the least known. <lb/>
            So that in order to explain them we must compare them with <lb/>
            the same parts of those animals which are most nearly allied. <pb n="19"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. I.] </note> </p>
          <p>2. First of all, the brain is placed in the fore-part of the <lb/>
            head, and it occupies the same position in all animals that <lb/>
            have this part, which belongs to all sanguineous and cepha­ <lb/>
            lopodous animals. In proportion to his size, man has the <lb/>
            largest brain of all animals, and the moistest. Two mem­ <lb/>
            branes enclose the brain: that outside the skull is the strong­ <lb/>
            est ; the inner membrane is slighter than the outer one. In <lb/>
            all animals the brain is in two portions. The cerebellum is <lb/>
            placed upon the brain at its lowest extremity. It is different <lb/>
            from the brain both to the touch and in appearance.</p>
          <p>3. The back of the head is empty and hollow in all ani­ <lb/>
            mals in proportion to their size, for some have a large head, <lb/>
            but the part lying under the face is less in those animals <lb/>
            which have round faces ; others have a small head and large <lb/>
            jaws, as the whole tribe of Lophuri. In all animals the brain <lb/>
            is without blood, nor does it contain any veins, and it is <lb/>
            naturally cold to the touch. The greater number of animals <lb/>
            have a small cavity in the centre of the brain. And round <lb/>
            this a membrane filled with veins: this membrane is like <lb/>
            skin, and encloses the brain. Above the brain is the smooth­ <lb/>
            est and weakest bone in the head-it is called sinciput.</p>
          <p>4. Three passages lead from the eye to the brain; the <lb/>
            largest and the middle-sized to the cerebellum, the least to <lb/>
            the brain itself. The least is that which is nearest the nostril; <lb/>
            the greater are parallel, and do not meet; but the middle- <lb/>
            sized passages meet: this is most evident in fishes, and <lb/>
            these passages are nearer to the brain than the larger, but <lb/>
            the least separate from each other, and do not meet.</p>
          <p>5. Within the neck is the oesophagus, which also de­ <lb/>
            rives its additional name, the isthmus, from its length and <lb/>
            narrowness, and the trachea. The trachea lies in front of <lb/>
            the oesophagus in all animals which possess this part, that is, <lb/>
            all animals which breathe from the lungs. The trachea is <lb/>
            cartilaginous in its nature, and contains but little blood : it <lb/>
            is surrounded with many smooth rings of cartilage, and it <lb/>
            lies upon the upper part towards the mouth, opposite the pas­ <lb/>
            sage from the nostril to the mouth, wherefore, also, if any <lb/>
            liquid is drawn into it in drinking, it passes out of the mouth <lb/>
            through the nostrils.</p>
          <p>6. Between the passages is the epiglottis, which can be <lb/>
            folded over the passage which extends from the trachea to the <note type="footnote"> C 2 </note> <pb n="20"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. I. </note> <lb/>
            mouth; by the epiglottis the passage of the tongue is closed, <lb/>
            at the other extremity the trachea reaches to the middle <lb/>
            of the lungs, and afterwards divides to each side of the lungs. <lb/>
            For the lung is double in all animals which possess this <lb/>
            part, though the division is not so marked in viviparous ani­ <lb/>
            mals, and least of all in man. The human lungs are ano­ <lb/>
            malous, neither being divided into many lobes, as in other <lb/>
            animals, nor being smooth.</p>
          <p>7. In oviparous animals, such as birds and the oviparous <lb/>
            quadrupeds, the parts are very widely separated, so that <lb/>
            they appear to have two lungs ; they are, however, only two <lb/>
            divisions of the trachea extending to each side of the lungs; <lb/>
            the trachea is also united with the great vein and with the <lb/>
            part called the aorta. When the trachea is filled with air, <lb/>
            it distributes the breath into the cavities of the lungs, which <lb/>
            have cartilaginous interstices ending in a point; the passages <lb/>
            of these interstices go through the whole lungs, always divid­ <lb/>
            ing from greater into less.</p>
          <p>8. The heart is connected with the trachea by fatty and car­ <lb/>
            tilaginous muscular bands. There is a cavity near the junction, <lb/>
            and in some animals, when the trachea is filled with breath, <lb/>
            this cavity is not always distinguishable, but in larger ani­ <lb/>
            mals it is evident that the breath enters it. This then is the <lb/>
            form of the trachea, which only inhales and exhales breath, <lb/>
            and nothing else either dry or moist, or it suffers pain till that <lb/>
            which has passed down is coughed up.</p>
          <p>9. The oesophagus is joined to the mouth from above, near <lb/>
            the trachea, being united both to the spine and the trachea <lb/>
            by membranaceous ligaments. It passes through the dia­ <lb/>
            phragm into the cavity of the stomach, is fleshy in its nature, <lb/>
            and is extensible both in length and breadth. The human <lb/>
            stomach is like that of a dog, not a great deal larger than the <lb/>
            entrail, but like a wide bowel; after this there is an entrail <lb/>
            simply rolled together, then an entrail of moderate width. <lb/>
            The lower part of the abdomen is like that of a hog, for it is <lb/>
            wide, and from this to the seat it is short and thick.</p>
          <p>10. The omentum is united to the abdomen in the middle, <lb/>
            and is in its nature a fatty membrane, as in other animals <lb/>
            with a single stomach and teeth in both jaws. The mesente­ <lb/>
            rium is over the bowels ; it is membranaceous, broad, and fat; <lb/>
            it is united to the great vein and the aorta: through it extend <pb n="21"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. I.] </note> <lb/>
            many numerous veins at its junction with the intestines, <lb/>
            reaching from above downwards. This is the nature of the <lb/>
            oesophagus, trachea, and the parts of the abdominal cavity.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XIV.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. THE heart has three cavities : it lies above the lungs, near <lb/>
            the division of the trachea. It has a fat and thick membrane, <lb/>
            by which it is united to the great vein and the aorta, and it <lb/>
            lies upon the aorta near the apex; and the apex is placed in <lb/>
            the same situation in all animals which have a chest; and in <lb/>
            all animals, whether they have or have not a chest, the apex <lb/>
            of the heart is forwards, though it often escapes notice by <lb/>
            the change of position in the parts when dissected. The <lb/>
            gibbous portion of the heart is upwards; its apex is gene­ <lb/>
            rally fleshy and thick, and there is a sinew in the cavities.</p>
          <p>2. In all other animals which have a chest the heart is placed <lb/>
            in the centre; in man it is rather on the left side, inclining <lb/>
            a little from the division of the mammæ towards the left <lb/>
            breast in the upper part of the chest; it is not large; its <lb/>
            whole form is not long, but rather round, except that the <lb/>
            extremity ends in a point It has three cavities, as I have <lb/>
            said. The greatest is that on the right, the least on the <lb/>
            left, the middle one is of intermediate size. They are all <lb/>
            perforated towards the lungs. It has both the two smaller, <lb/>
            and all of them perforated towards the lungs, and this is <lb/>
            evident in one of the cavities downwards from its point of <lb/>
            attachment.</p>
          <p>3. Near the principal cavity it is attached to the great <lb/>
            vein to which also the mesenterium is united, and in the <lb/>
            middle it is attached to the aorta. Passages lead from <lb/>
            the lungs to the heart, and they are divided in the same <lb/>
            way as the trachea, following the passages from the trachea <lb/>
            throughout the whole lungs, and the passages leading from <lb/>
            the heart are on the upper part. There is no passage which <lb/>
            is common to them both, but by their union they receive the <lb/>
            breath and transmit it through the heart; for one of the <lb/>
            passages leads to the right cavity, and the other to the left. <lb/>
            We will hereafter speak of the great vein and the aorta in <lb/>
            the portion of our work which treats of these parts.</p>
          <p>4. In all animals which have lungs and are viviparous, either <lb/>
            internally or externally, the lung has more blood than all the <pb n="22"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. I. </note> <lb/>
            other parts; for the whole lung is spongy, and through each <lb/>
            perforation branches of the great vein proceed. Those per­ <lb/>
            sons are deceived who say that the lungs are empty, drawing <lb/>
            their conclusion from dissected animals, from which all the <lb/>
            blood has escaped. Of all the viscera the heart alone con­ <lb/>
            tains blood, and in the lungs the blood is not in the lungs <lb/>
            themselves, but in the veins by which they are perforated. <lb/>
            But in the heart itself the blood is in each of the cavities, <lb/>
            but the thinnest blood is in the middle cavity.</p>
          <p>5. Beneath the lungs is that division of the trunk which <lb/>
            is called the diaphragm. It is united to the ribs, the hypo­ <lb/>
            chondriac region, and the spine. In the centre is a smooth <lb/>
            membranous part, and there are veins extending through it. <lb/>
            The human veins are thick in proportion to the size of the <lb/>
            body. Under the diaphragm, on the right side is the liver, <lb/>
            on the left the spleen, alike in all animals which are fur­ <lb/>
            nished with these parts in their natural form and without <lb/>
            monstrosity, for already there has been observed an altered <lb/>
            order in some quadrupeds. They are joined to the abdomen <lb/>
            near the omentum.</p>
          <p>6. The appearance of the human spleen is narrow and long, <lb/>
            like that of the hog. Generally speaking, and in most ani­ <lb/>
            mals, the liver is not furnished with a gall, though this is <lb/>
            found in some animals. The human liver is round, like that <lb/>
            of the ox. This is the case also in animals offered for sacri­ <lb/>
            fice, as in the district of Chalets, in Eubœa, where the sheep <lb/>
            have no gall, and in Naxos it is so large in nearly all the ani­ <lb/>
            mals, that strangers who come to sacrifice are surprised, and <lb/>
            think that it is ominous, and not at all natural. The liver is <lb/>
            united with the great vein, but has no part in common with <lb/>
            the aorta. For a vein branches off from the great vein through <lb/>
            the liver, at the place where the gates of the liver, as they <lb/>
            are called, are situated. The spleen also is only connected with <lb/>
            the great vein, for a vein extends from this to the spleen.</p>
          <p>7. Next to these are the kidneys, which lie close to <lb/>
            the spine. In their nature they are like the kidneys of <lb/>
            oxen. In all animals that have kidneys the right kidney <lb/>
            lies higher than the left, and is covered with less fat, and is <lb/>
            more dry than the left. This is the same in all animals. <lb/>
            Passages lead from them to the great vein and to the aorta, <lb/>
            but not to the cavity; for all animals, except the seal, have <pb n="23"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. I.] </note> <lb/>
            a cavity in their kidneys, though it is greater in some than <lb/>
            in others. The human kidneys, though similar to those of <lb/>
            oxen, are more solid than in other animals, and the passages <lb/>
            that lead to them end in the body of the kidney; and this is <lb/>
            a proof that they do not pass through them, that they con­ <lb/>
            tain no blood in the living animal, nor is it coagulated in <lb/>
            them when dead; but they have a small cavity, as I said <lb/>
            before. From the cavity of the kidneys two strong pas­ <lb/>
            sages lead to the bladder, and two others, strong and con­ <lb/>
            tinuous, lead to the aorta.</p>
          <p>8. A hollow, sinewy vein is attached to the middle of each <lb/>
            kidney, which extends from the spine through small branches, <lb/>
            and disappears towards the hip, though it afterwards ap­ <lb/>
            pears again upon the hip. The branches of these veins reach <lb/>
            to the bladder; for the bladder is placed lowest of all, being <lb/>
            united to the passages which proceed from the kidneys by <lb/>
            the neck which reaches to the urethra; and nearly all round <lb/>
            its circumference it is united by smooth and muscular mem­ <lb/>
            branes, very similar in form to those upon the diaphragm of <lb/>
            the chest.</p>
          <p>9. The human bladder is moderately large in size, and the <lb/>
            pudendum is united to the neck of the bladder, having a strong <lb/>
            passage above and a small one below. One of these pas­ <lb/>
            sages leads to the testicles; the other, which is sinewy and <lb/>
            cartilaginous, to the bladder. From this are appended the <lb/>
            testicles of the male, concerning which we will treat in the <lb/>
            part devoted to their consideration. These parts are the same <lb/>
            in the female, who differs in none of the internal parts except <lb/>
            the womb, the appearance of which may be learned from <lb/>
            the drawings in the books on anatomy. Its position is upon <lb/>
            the entrails. The bladder is above the uterus. In a future <lb/>
            book we will speak of the nature of the uterus generally ; <lb/>
            for it is not alike, nor has it the same nature in them all.</p>
          <p>These are the internal and external parts of the human <lb/>
            body, and this is their nature and their manner. <pb n="24"/>

          <p>1. OF the parts of other animals some are common to them <lb/>
            all, as I have said before, and some belong to particular <lb/>
            classes, and they agree and differ in the manner often before <lb/>
            mentioned. For almost all animals which differ in kind, <lb/>
            have also their parts different in form, and there are some <lb/>
            which have only a proportionate resemblance, but differ in <lb/>
            kind, and others agree in kind, but not in form, and many <lb/>
            parts belong to some which others have not. Viviparous <lb/>
            quadrupeds have a head and neck, and all the parts of the <lb/>
            head, but they differ from each other in their forms. The <lb/>
            lion has one bone in the neck, but has no vertebra, and <lb/>
            when laid open its internal parts are like those of a dog.</p>
          <p>2. Viviparous quadrupeds have fore-legs instead of arms, <lb/>
            and in all quadrupeds, especially those which have the fore- <lb/>
            feet much divided, they are analogous to hands, for they <lb/>
            use them as hands, and the left legs are less at liberty than <lb/>
            in men, except in the elephant, and this animal has the toes <lb/>
            less perfectly jointed, and its fore-legs much larger than the <lb/>
            hind ones; it has five toes, and short ankles to its hind legs. <lb/>
            It has a trunk of such a nature and length as to be able to <lb/>
            use it for a hand, and it drinks and eats by stretching this <lb/>
            into its mouth; this also it lifts up to its driver, and pulls <lb/>
            up trees with it; with this organ it breathes as it walks <lb/>
            through the water. The extremity of the proboscis is curved, <lb/>
            but without joints, for it is cartilaginous.</p>
          <p>3. Man is the only ambidextrous animal. All animals have <lb/>
            their chest analogous to man, but not similar to his, for he <lb/>
            has a wide chest, and theirs is narrow: no animal but man <lb/>
            has pectoral mammæ; the elephant has two mammæ, but not <lb/>
            on the breast, though they are in that direction.</p>
          <p>4. All animals, excepting the elephant, bend both their <lb/>
            fore aid hind legs in contrary directions, and also contrary <lb/>
            to the way in which a man's limbs are bent. For in vivi­ <lb/>
            parous quadrupeds, except the elephant, the joints of the <pb n="25"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. II.] </note> <lb/>
            fore-legs are bent forwards, and those of the hind-legs back­ <lb/>
            wards, and they have the hollow part of their circumference <lb/>
            opposite to each other: the elephant is not constructed as <lb/>
            some have said, but is able to sit down, and bend his legs, <lb/>
            but, from his great weight, is unable to bend them on both <lb/>
            sides at once, but leans either to the right side or the left, and <lb/>
            sleeps in this position, but its hind legs are bent like a man's.</p>
          <p>5. In oviparous quadrupeds, as the crocodile, lizard, and <lb/>
            such like, both the fore and hind legs are bent forwards, <lb/>
            inclining a little to the side, and likewise also in other ani­ <lb/>
            mals with more than four feet, except that the middle joint <lb/>
            of their last pair of legs is always doubtful, and is rather <lb/>
            bent towards the side. And man also has both the flexures <lb/>
            of his limbs in the same direction, and those of his arms <lb/>
            and legs contrary to each other, for he bends the arm back­ <lb/>
            wards, except that the external part of the arm is a little <lb/>
            inclined inwards, towards the side; the legs bend forwards.</p>
          <p>6. No animal bends the joints both of its fore and hind <lb/>
            legs backwards. The flexure of the cubitus and fore-leg is <lb/>
            in a contrary direction to the flexure of the shoulder in all <lb/>
            animals, and the flexure of the knee is contrary to that of the <lb/>
            hip; so that since man bends his joints in the contrary direc­ <lb/>
            tion to many animals, those which have such joints as man's <lb/>
            also bend them in a contrary direction to many animals. Birds <lb/>
            bend their limbs in a direction similar to that of quadrupeds, <lb/>
            for being bipeds, they bend their legs backwards, and have <lb/>
            wings instead of arms, or fore-legs, and these bend forwards.</p>
          <p>7. The seal is like a maimed quadruped, for immedi­ <lb/>
            ately beneath the scapula it has feet like hands, as are also <lb/>
            those of the bear, for they are five-fingered, and each of the <lb/>
            fingers has three joints, and a small claw: the hind feet are <lb/>
            five-fingered, and each of the fingers has joints and claws like <lb/>
            those upon the fore-feet; in shape they are very like the tail <lb/>
            of a fish.</p>
          <p>8. The movements of animals, whether they have four <lb/>
            feet or more, are in the direction of the longer diameter of <lb/>
            their bodies, and thus also they stand, the commencement <lb/>
            of motion is always on the right side of their bodies. The <lb/>
            lion and the camel, both the Arabian and Bactrian, walk with <lb/>
            the hind-foot following the fore-foot on the same side, and <lb/>
            this means that the right foot is not put before the left, but <lb/>
            follows it. <pb n="26"/>

            <title type="sub">CHAPTER IT.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. WHATEVER parts a man has before, a quadruped has be­ <lb/>
            neath : those that are behind in man, form the quadruped's <lb/>
            back ; most animals have a tail, the seal has a small one, like <lb/>
            that of a stag; hereafter we shall speak of apelike animals. <lb/>
            All viviparous quadrupeds are, so to say, rough, with hair, <lb/>
            and not like man, who, except on his head, has not much hair <lb/>
            on his body, and what there is, is very fine; but his head is <lb/>
            more massy than that of other animals.</p>
          <p>2. And all creatures that have their upper part rough <lb/>
            with hair, are quite smooth, or only slightly rough beneath; <lb/>
            but man is contrary to this: and again, each eyelid in man <lb/>
            is furnished. with lashes, and he has hair on the cheek, and <lb/>
            pubes; other animals are not so furnished, having no hair <lb/>
            on the lower eyelid, or only a few hairs under the eyelid.</p>
          <p>3. But some hairy quadrupeds are rough all over, as the <lb/>
            hog, the bear, and the dog; the neck of others is the roughest <lb/>
            part, as in those which have a mane, like the lion; in others <lb/>
            which have a mane, the back of the neck from the head to <lb/>
            the point of the shoulder is hairy, as the horse and the mule, <lb/>
            and among wild animals with horns, the bonassus. The <lb/>
            hipellaphus,1 as it is called, has a mane upon the point of <lb/>
            its shoulder, and so has the pardium,2 though both these <lb/>
            have a thin mane from the head to the shoulder, and the <lb/>
            hipellaphus has a beard upon its larynx.</p>
          <p>4. Both of these are horned, and have a cloven hoof: the <lb/>
            female hipellaphus has no horns, it is about the size of a <lb/>
            stag; there are hipellaphi in the country of the Arachotæ, <lb/>
            where also are buffaloes. The wild differ as much from do­ <lb/>
            mesticated oxen, as wild hogs from tame ones; for they <lb/>
            are black, and of great strength ; their nose is curved like <lb/>
            an eagle's beak, and their horns lie backwards; the horns of <lb/>
            the hipellaphus are very like those of the dorcas :3 the ele­ <lb/>
            phant is the least hairy of all quadrupeds. The tails of ani­ <lb/>
            mals are like their bodies in roughness, and smoothness, in <lb/>
            as many as have tails in proportion to their size, for some <lb/>
            have very small tails. <note type="footnote"> 1 Perhaps Nylghau (Liddel and Scott's Lexicon), or some large kind <lb/>
            of Stag. </note><note type="footnote">2 Cameleopard. (Schneider.) </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Gazelle or antelope, so named from the brightness of its eyes. </note> <pb n="27"/>
            <note type="margin"> B II.] </note> </p>
          <p>5. Camels have a part peculiar to themselves, called the <lb/>
            hump upon the back; the Bactrian camel differs from the <lb/>
            Arabian; the one has two humps, the other but one; and they <lb/>
            have another hump below, like the one on their back, upon <lb/>
            which the rest of their body is supported, when they go <lb/>
            down upon their knees. The camel has four mammæ, like the <lb/>
            cow, and a tail like an ass, and the pudendum is behind; <lb/>
            it has but one knee in each leg, and not many joints, as <lb/>
            some persons say; this appearance arises from the position <lb/>
            of the abdomen. It has a a talus like that of an ox, mis­ <lb/>
            shapen, and small in proportion to its size.</p>
          <p>6. The hoof is cloven; it has not teeth in both jaws. <lb/>
            The cloven hoof is formed in this manner; the lower part is <lb/>
            somewhat cloven, as far as the second joint of the toes, but <lb/>
            the upper part is four-cleft as far as the first joint of the <lb/>
            toes; there is a membrane uniting the cloven parts as in <lb/>
            geese, the foot is fleshy underneath like that of a bear, where­ <lb/>
            fore, when camels are used in war, and become footsore, their <lb/>
            drivers put them on leather shoes. All quadrupeds have <lb/>
            their legs bony and sinewy and without flesh, that is all <lb/>
            animals with feet are so formed, excepting man, and they <lb/>
            are without hips; this is particularly the case with birds. <lb/>
            But on the contrary, the hips, thighs, and legs of man are <lb/>
            more fleshy than almost any other part of his body, for even <lb/>
            the calf of his leg is fleshy.</p>
          <p>7. Some sanguineous and viviparous quadrupeds have many <lb/>
            divisions in the foot, like the hands and feet of man; for <lb/>
            some, as the lion, the dog, and the panther, have many divi­ <lb/>
            sions of the foot; others are cloven-footed, and instead of <lb/>
            nails have hoofs, as the sheep, the goat, the stag, and the <lb/>
            river-horse. Some are without divisions in the foot, as the <lb/>
            solidunguli, the horse, and the mule. The genus of swine <lb/>
            belongs to both classes; for in Illyria, Pæonia, and other <lb/>
            places, there are swine with a solid hoof. Those with a two­ <lb/>
            cleft hoof have two divisions, before and behind; in those <lb/>
            with a solid hoof this is continuous.</p>
          <p>8. Some animals have horns, others have none; most of <lb/>
            those with horns have also cloven feet, as the ox, the stag, <lb/>
            and the goat. We have never seen an animal with a solid <lb/>
            hoof with two horns, and there are only a few that have a <lb/>
            solid hoof and one horn, as the Indian ais, and the oryx.1 <note type="footnote">1 Antelope Oryx. </note> <pb n="28"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. II </note> <lb/>
            Of all animals with a solid hoof, the Indian ass alone has a <lb/>
            talus. Swine, as I said before, belong to both classes, so that <lb/>
            they have not a well-formed astragulus.</p>
          <p>9. Many animals with cloven hoofs have a talus ; no ani. <lb/>
            mals with their feet in many divisions have a talus, nor has <lb/>
            man. The lynx has as it were half a talus, and so has the <lb/>
            lion, but it is more intricate, as some pretend. The talus is <lb/>
            always in the hind leg, and it is placed upright upon the gamb, <lb/>
            with the lower part outwards, and the upper part inwards; <lb/>
            the parts called Coal turned inwards towards each other, and <lb/>
            the Chia turned outwards, and the projecting portions up­ <lb/>
            wards. This is the position of the talus, in all animals <lb/>
            which are furnished with this part. Some animals have a <lb/>
            cloven hoof, and a mane, and two horns turned towards each <lb/>
            other, as the bonassus, an animal which inhabits the coun­ <lb/>
            try between Pæonia and Media.</p>
          <p>10. All animals with horns are four-footed, unless there is <lb/>
            any animal which metaphorically, and for the sake of a word, is <lb/>
            said to have horns, as they say that the serpents in the neigh­ <lb/>
            bourhood of Thebes in Egypt have, though it is nothing <lb/>
            more than an appendage, that is called a horn. The stag is <lb/>
            the only animal that has solid horns, the horns of all other <lb/>
            animals are hollow for a part of their length, and solid at <lb/>
            the extremity; the hollow part is principally formed of skin, <lb/>
            and round this is arranged the solid part, as in the horns of <lb/>
            oxen. The stag is the only animal which casts its horns; <lb/>
            they are reproduced; this takes place every year after the <lb/>
            anLnal has attained the age of two years; other animals <lb/>
            never lose their horns unless destroyed by violence.</p>

          <p>1. THE parts of the mammae also, and the organs of genera­ <lb/>
            tion, are different in man and in other animals For some <lb/>
            have the mammæ forward on or near the breast, and two <lb/>
            mammæ with two nipples, as man and the elephant, as I <lb/>
            said before, for the elephant has two mammæ near the arm­ <lb/>
            pits ; in the female they are small, and do not bear any <lb/>
            proportion to the size of the animal, so that they are <lb/>
            scarcely visible in a side view; the males also have mammæ as <lb/>
            well as the females, but they are exceedingly small. <note type="footnote"> 1 Coa, the highest throw with the Astragalus with the convex side up* <lb/>
            permost, opposed to Cilia, the lowest throw, sizes and aLes. </note> <pb n="29"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. II.] </note> </p>
          <p>2. The bear has four, other animals have two mammæ upon <lb/>
            the thighs, and two nipples like sheep; others have four nipples, <lb/>
            as the cow ; some animals have not their nipples on the breast <lb/>
            and thighs, but on the abdomen, as the dog and the hog, <lb/>
            they have many nipples, but not all of the same size; other <lb/>
            animals also have more than two, as the panther, which has <lb/>
            four on the abdomen ; the lioness has two on the abdomen, <lb/>
            the camel has two mammæ and four nipples, like the cow.</p>
          <p>3. Among animals with a solid hoof the males have no <lb/>
            mammæ, except some horses which bear a resemblance to <lb/>
            their dams. Some males have the penis external, as man, and <lb/>
            the horse, and many others; some internal, as the dolphin, <lb/>
            Of those animals in which it is external, some have it in <lb/>
            front, as those which I have named ; and some of these have <lb/>
            both the penis and testicles loose, as in man; others have <lb/>
            them close to the abdomen; some have them more, others <lb/>
            less loose, for this part is not equally free in the boar and <lb/>
            the horse.</p>
          <p>4. The elephant has a penis like a horse, but small and less in <lb/>
            proportion to the size of its body; its testicles are not external <lb/>
            but internal, and near the kidneys, wherefore also the work <lb/>
            of copulation is quickly performed. The female has the <lb/>
            pudendum in the same position as the udder of the sheep, <lb/>
            and when excited with desire, it is lifted up outwards, so as <lb/>
            to be ready for copulation with the male; and the orifice of <lb/>
            the pudendum is very wide. Most animals have the penis <lb/>
            in the same direction, but some are retromingent, as the lynx, <lb/>
            lion, camel, and hare. In some males, as I have said, the <lb/>
            direction of the penis is different, but all females are re­ <lb/>
            tromingent, for even in the female elephant the pudendum is <lb/>
            placed under the thighs, as in other animals.</p>
          <p>5. The penis is very different in different animals, for in some <lb/>
            it is cartilaginous and fleshy, as in man ; the fleshy part does <lb/>
            not swell, but the cartilaginous portion is erected; in others <lb/>
            it is sinewy, as the camel and the stag; in others it is bony, as <lb/>
            the fox and the wolf, the weasel and the martin, for the <lb/>
            martin also has a bony penis.</p>
          <p>6. Again, man being a perfect animal, has the upper part <lb/>
            of his body less than the lower part; the contrary is the case <lb/>
            with other sanguineous animals: by the upper portion of <lb/>
            his body we mean the portion of his body from the head to <pb n="30"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. II.</note> <lb/>
            the anus; and by the lower, the parts from hence down­ <lb/>
            wards. In those animals which have feet the hind leg is <lb/>
            the lower part of the body in point of size; and in those <lb/>
            without legs, the same relation is observed in their various <lb/>
            kinds of tails. Such is the nature of perfected animals, but <lb/>
            they differ in the development of their parts. Man in the <lb/>
            young state has the upper part of his body greater than the <lb/>
            lower; but as he grows the proportion of his parts changes, <lb/>
            wherefore also he is the only animal which does not move in <lb/>
            the same way when young and when grown up, for at first <lb/>
            a child crawls like a four-footed animal.</p>
          <p>7. Some animals grow in the same proportion throughout, as <lb/>
            the dog-others when they are first born have their uppei <lb/>
            part proportionally less than the lower, but as they approach <lb/>
            maturity, the upper parts increase in size, as in the lophuri, <lb/>
            for in these animals the part from the hoof to the haunch never <lb/>
            grows after their birth.</p>
          <p>8. There is a great difference in the teeth of animals, both <lb/>
            among themselves and from the human type; all viviparous <lb/>
            and sanguineous quadrupeds have teeth; some have teeth in <lb/>
            both jaws, which others have not; this is the first distinction. <lb/>
            Those which have horns do not possess teeth in both jaws, <lb/>
            for they have no front teeth in the upper jaw. There are <lb/>
            others, as the camel, which, though it has no horns, has not <lb/>
            teeth in the upper jaw.</p>
          <p>9. Some animals have tusks like the boar, others have not; <lb/>
            some have pointed teeth, as the lion, panther, and dog; the <lb/>
            teeth of others have an even surface, as the ox and the horse. <lb/>
            Animals with pointed teeth have their teeth fitting into each <lb/>
            other; no animal has both tusks and horns, neither those <lb/>
            with pointed teeth nor any others. Most animals have their <lb/>
            front teeth sharp, and their hind teeth flat; all the teeth of <lb/>
            the seal are sharp pointed, showing an approximation to the <lb/>
            race of fishes, for all fishes have pointed teeth.</p>
          <p>10. None of these genera have a double row of teeth. But, <lb/>
            if we may believe Ctesias, there are some which have this <lb/>
            peculiarity, for be mentions an Indian animal called marti­ <lb/>
            chora, which had three rows of teeth in each jaw; it is as <lb/>
            large and as rough as a lion, and has similar feet, but its <lb/>
            ears and face are like those of a man; its eye is grey, and <lb/>
            its body red\ it has a tail like a land scorpion, in which there <pb n="31"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. II.] </note> <lb/>
            is a sting; it darts forth the spines with which it is <lb/>
            covered instead of hair, and it utters a noise resembling the <lb/>
            united sound. of a pipe and a trumpet; it is not less swift of <lb/>
            foot than a stag, and is wild, and devours men.</p>
          <p>11. Man sheds his teeth, and so do other animals, as the <lb/>
            horse, the mule, and the ass ; man sheds his front teeth, but no <lb/>
            animal sheds the molar teeth ; swine do not shed any of their <lb/>
            teeth. About dogs, there is some doubt; some persons think <lb/>
            they do not shed their teeth at all, others that they shed only <lb/>
            the canine teeth ; but it has been observed that they do shed <lb/>
            their teeth like men : perhaps it has escaped notice, because <lb/>
            they do not shed them before the inner ones, which are simi­ <lb/>
            lar, are grown up.</p>
          <p>12. And it is probable that the same takes place in other <lb/>
            wild animals, since they are said only to shed their canine <lb/>
            teeth. Young dogs are known from old ones by their teeth, <lb/>
            for young dogs have sharp white teeth, old dogs have them <lb/>
            black and blunted. The horse is in this respect different <lb/>
            from all other animals ; for while the teeth in other animals <lb/>
            become darker as they grow older, in the horse they become <lb/>
            more white.</p>
          <p>13. Those which are called canine teeth are placed between <lb/>
            the cutting and the molar teeth, and partake of the nature of <lb/>
            both, for they are wide below, but sharp at the top. The <lb/>
            male has more teeth than the female in mankind, and sheep, <lb/>
            and goats, and swine. This has not been observed in other <lb/>
            animals. Those persons which have the greatest number of <lb/>
            teeth are the longest lived; those which have them widely <lb/>
            separated, smaller, and more scattered, are generally more <lb/>
            short lived.</p>
          <p>14. The last molar teeth, which are called wisdom teeth, ap­ <lb/>
            pear, both in the male and female about the age of twenty, <lb/>
            and some women cut the molar teeth at eighty years of age, <lb/>
            causing great pain in the extremity of the jaw, and some <lb/>
            men also: this happens with persons who do not cut their <lb/>
            wise teeth at the proper age.</p>
          <p>15. The elephant has four teeth on each side, with which he <lb/>
            grinds his food, for he reduces his food very small, like meal. <lb/>
            Besides these, he has two tusks: in the male these are large, <lb/>
            and turned upwards; in the female they are small, and bent <lb/>
            in the contrary direction. The elephant has teeth as soon <pb n="32"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. II. </note> <lb/>
            as it is born; but the tusks are small, and therefore in. <lb/>
            conspicuous at first. It has so small a tongue within its <lb/>
            mouth, that it is difficult to see it.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER IV.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. ANIMALS have very differently-sized mouths, for some have <lb/>
            wide, open mouths, as the dog, the lion, and all animals <lb/>
            with pointed teeth; other animals have a small mouth, as <lb/>
            man, or a moderately-sized one, as the swine. The Egyp­ <lb/>
            tian river-horse has a mane like a horse, and a cloven hoof <lb/>
            like the ox ; it has a flat face ; the talus is like that of other <lb/>
            animals with cloven hoofs, and it has large projecting teeth ; <lb/>
            it has a tail like a hog, and utters a sound like the neigh­ <lb/>
            ing of a horse; it is about the size of an ass, and its skin is <lb/>
            so thick that shields are made of it; its intestines are like <lb/>
            those of a horse or ass.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER V.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. SOME animals unite in their nature the characteristics of <lb/>
            man and quadrupeds, as apes, monkeys, and cynocephali. <lb/>
            The monkey is an ape with a tail; cynocephali have the same <lb/>
            form as apes, but are larger and stronger, and their faces <lb/>
            are more like dogs' faces; they are naturally fierce, and their <lb/>
            teeth are more like dogs' teeth, and stronger than in other <lb/>
            genera.</p>
          <p>2. The apes are hairy in their upper parts, so as to bear <lb/>
            some resemblance to quadrupeds, and also in the lower, <lb/>
            because they are like men, for in this particular, as I said <lb/>
            before, there is a difference in men and brutes; their hair <lb/>
            is coarse, and apes are rough both above and below. They <lb/>
            bear a strong likeness to men in their face, for their nos­ <lb/>
            trils, ears, and teeth, both the fore and back teeth, are like <lb/>
            his; and as for eye-lashes, though other animals are entirely <lb/>
            without them, the ape has them on the lower eye-lid; they <lb/>
            are, however, very thin, and altogether small.</p>
          <p>3. Upon the breast are two small mammæ,with two nipples; <lb/>
            the arms are like those of man, but hairy; both the arms and <lb/>
            legs are bent like those of man, the curves of the limbs being <lb/>
            turned towards each other. Besides these, it has hands, fin <lb/>
            geTs, and nails like those of man. but all indicating an ap­ <lb/>
            proximation to the brute ; their feet are peculiar, for they <pb n="33"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. II. </note> <lb/>
            are like great hands. The fingers upon them are like those <lb/>
            on the hands, and the middle one is the longest; the sole <lb/>
            of the foot is like a hand, except that it extends the whole <lb/>
            length of the hand like a palm, and is hard at the extremity, <lb/>
            and is a bad and obscure representation of a heel.</p>
          <p>4. The feet are used for both the purposes of hands and <lb/>
            feet, and are bent like hands. The humerus and the femur <lb/>
            are short compared with the cubitus and the leg. The navel <lb/>
            is not prominent, and there is a hard place about the region <lb/>
            of the navel. Like quadrupeds, the upper part of the body <lb/>
            is much larger than the lower, almost in the proportion of <lb/>
            five to three, and the feet are like hands, and as it were <lb/>
            made up of hands and feet, a foot as far as the extremity <lb/>
            of the heel, and the remainder like a hand, for the fingers <lb/>
            are furnished with something like a palm.</p>
          <p>5. The ape passes more of its time as a quadruped than <lb/>
            a biped, and like a quadruped, it has no nates, nor has it <lb/>
            a tail like a biped, but only something in representation of <lb/>
            a tail. The pudendum of the female resembles that of a <lb/>
            woman ; that of the male is more like a dog's. The monkey, <lb/>
            as I said before, has a tail, and all the internal parts of <lb/>
            the body are like those of man. The external parts of vivi­ <lb/>
            parous quadrupeds are of this nature.</p>

          <p>1. OVIPAROUS and sanguineous quadrupeds (for no san­ <lb/>
            guineous land animal that is not either a quadruped or apodal <lb/>
            is oviparous) have a head, neck, back, upper and lower parts <lb/>
            of the body, and fore and hind legs, and something resem­ <lb/>
            bling a breast, like oviparous quadrupeds : most of them also <lb/>
            have a large tail, some a small one; all of them have many toes <lb/>
            and divided feet, and all the organs of sense, and a tongue, <lb/>
            except the Egyptian crocodile. And in this respect it re­ <lb/>
            sembles some fishes, for the tongue of fishes is thorny, and <lb/>
            not free, and in some the place for the tongue is altogether <lb/>
            smooth, and without division (so that nothing is visible), <lb/>
            unless the lips are drawn aside.</p>
          <p>2. They have no ears, only a passage for hearing; neither <lb/>
            have they any mammæ, and the penis and testicles are in­ <lb/>
            ternal, and not external. They have no hair, but are covered <lb/>
            with scales, and all are furnished with sharp teeth. The <note type="footnote"> D </note> <pb n="34"/>

            river-cocodiles have eyes like hogs, and great sharp teeth, <lb/>
            strong claws, and an unbroken scaly skin. In the water <lb/>
            their sight is imperfect, but very good on land. They pass <lb/>
            the greatest part of the day on land, and of the night in the <lb/>
            water, for they cannot bear the cold air.</p>

          <p>1. THE chameleon has the whole of its body like that of a <lb/>
            lizard, and the ribs, descending downwards, are joined to­ <lb/>
            gether on the hypogastric region, like those of fish, and <lb/>
            the back-bone stands up, like that of a fish ; its face is like <lb/>
            that of the choeropithecus.1 It has a very long tail; the ex­ <lb/>
            tremity is very smooth, and rolled together like a thong. It <lb/>
            is raised, upon longer legs than a lizard ; the joints of the legs <lb/>
            are bent in the same direction as the lizard's.</p>
          <p>2. Each of its feet is divided into two parts, having the <lb/>
            same relation to each other as our thumbs have to the <lb/>
            rest of the hand : and, for a short distance, each of these is <lb/>
            divided into toes; in the fore-feet the internal part has three, <lb/>
            the external two toes; in the hind feet the internal part <lb/>
            has two, and the external three toes ; there is a claw upon <lb/>
            each of its toes like that of birds of prey; its whole body <lb/>
            is rough, like the crocodile.</p>
          <p>3. Its eyes are placed in a hollow, and are very large <lb/>
            and round; surrounded with skin like the rest of its body, <lb/>
            and in the middle is left a small aperture through which <lb/>
            it sees; this is never covered with skin. The eye is turned <lb/>
            round in a circle, and it can direct its vision to any side, so <lb/>
            that it can see where it will. The change in the colour of <lb/>
            its skin takes place when it is filled with air. It can acquire <lb/>
            either a black colour, like that of the crocodile, or ochreous, <lb/>
            like that of the lizard, or spotted with black, like the pan­ <lb/>
            ther ; and this change takes place over the whole body, for the <lb/>
            eyes also change like the rest of the body, and so does the tail.</p>
          <p>4. Its movements are slow, like those of the tortoise; <lb/>
            when dying, it becomes ochreous, and retains this colour after <lb/>
            death. The oesophagus and trachea of the chameleon are <lb/>
            similar to the same parts in lizards ; it has no flesh, except a <lb/>
            little on the head and cheeks, and upon the appendage at the <lb/>
            end of its tail. It has no blood, except about the heart, and <note type="footnote">1 Simia rostrata, or perhaps baboon. (The identifications of the <lb/>

            eyes, and the parts above the heart, and the veins that ex­ <lb/>
            tend from these : and even in these there is very little blood.</p>
          <p>5. The brain lies a little above the eyes, and is continuous <lb/>
            with them ; and when the outside skin of the eye is taken <lb/>
            away, a bright object shines through it, like a bright <lb/>
            ring of brass Through the whole of its body many strong <lb/>
            membranes are extended, which are much stronger than in <lb/>
            other animals. It breathes strongly for some time after it <lb/>
            has been dissected, and there are some slight movements of <lb/>
            the heart; it also continues to contract its sides, but not the <lb/>
            other parts of the body. It has no distinct spleen; and it <lb/>
            hides itself in rocks like the lizard.</p>

          <p>1. BIRDS also have many parts like the animals described <lb/>
            above. For all these have a head, neck, back, and under <lb/>
            parts of the body, and something resembling a breast. They <lb/>
            have two legs, and thus resemble men more than other ani­ <lb/>
            mals, except that the joints bend backwards like those of quad­ <lb/>
            rupeds, as I said before. They have neither hands, nor fore- <lb/>
            feet, but wings; herein they differ from all other animals. <lb/>
            Again, the hip is like a thigh, large and united as far as <lb/>
            the middle of the abdomen, so as to look like a thigh, <lb/>
            when it is separated from the rest of the body; and the thigh <lb/>
            where it is joined to the leg is another part. The class of <lb/>
            birds with crooked claws have the largest thigh, and <lb/>
            stronger breasts than others.</p>
          <p>2. All birds have claws and many divisions of the foot; <lb/>
            in most of them the toes are quite separate; but the swim­ <lb/>
            mers have their feet covered with a web, but even these have <lb/>
            distinct and jointed toes. All birds that fly high in the air <lb/>
            have four toes; and, generally, these are placed three for­ <lb/>
            wards, and one backward, like a heel; a few birds have two <lb/>
            toes turned forwards and two backwards, as the bird called <lb/>
            jynx.1 This bird is somewhat larger than the spize,2 and is <lb/>
            variegated in appearance. The formation of its toes is pecu­ <lb/>
            liar, and so is that of its tongue, which is like a serpent's. <lb/>
            This it can project from its mouth, as much as the width of <lb/>
            four fingers, and draw it in again. Like a snake it can turn <lb/>
            its neck quite round, whilst the rest of its body is perfectly <note type="footnote">1 Jynx torquilla, wry-neck. </note><note type="footnote">2 Fringilla, finch. </note> <note type="footnote"> D2i </note> <pb n="36"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. II </note> <lb/>
            still. It has large claws, like those of the colius,1 and it <lb/>
            hisses with its voice.</p>
          <p>3. Birds have a mouth, but its construction is peculiar, <lb/>
            for they have neither lips nor teeth, but a beak, and <lb/>
            neither ears nor nostrils, but only passages for these organs, <lb/>
            for the nostrils in the beak, and for the ears in the head. <lb/>
            They have two eyes like other animals, without eyelashes; <lb/>
            when heavy with sleep, they close their eyes with the <lb/>
            lower eyelid; and all possess a nictitating membrane, which <lb/>
            closes the eye. The owl-like birds also use the upper eye­ <lb/>
            lid. The same is the nature of the scaly animals, as the <lb/>
            saurians, and others of this class; all of them close their <lb/>
            eyes with the lower eyelid, but they do not all wink like <lb/>
            birds. Again, birds have neither scales nor hair, but <lb/>
            feathers ; all the feathers have a stem.</p>
          <p>4. Birds have no tail, but a rump; in birds with long <lb/>
            legs, or palmated feet, this is short, in others it is large. <lb/>
            These last, when they fly, keep their legs close to the <lb/>
            body, but the others stretch them out behind them. All <lb/>
            birds have a tongue, but this differs in various kinds: <lb/>
            some have it large, others small. Next after man, some <lb/>
            birds articulate words better than any other animals; this is <lb/>
            particularly the case with those with broad tongues. No <lb/>
            oviparous animal has an epiglottis on its trachea: but it <lb/>
            can close and open the passage, so as to prevent any heavy <lb/>
            thing finding its way into the lungs.</p>
          <p>5. Some tribes of birds have spurs; this is never the <lb/>
            case with those which have crooked claws. Those with <lb/>
            crooked claws are more active in flight; those which have <lb/>
            spurs, are heavier in their make.</p>
          <p>6. Some birds have a crest, mostly formed of erect <lb/>
            feathers; the domestic fowl, alone, is peculiar, for its crest <lb/>
            is neither flesh, nor very unlike flesh.</p>

          <p>1. AMONG aquatic animals, there is one class of fish, which <lb/>
            embraces many forms, and is separated from other animals, <lb/>
            for it has a head, and upper and lower parts, in which last <lb/>
            are the stomach and bowels, and a continuous and undivided <lb/>
            tail. This is not alike in all. They have neither neck nor <lb/>
            limb, nor internal and external testicles, nor mammæ, nor <note type="footnote"> 1 Perhaps COITUS galgulus. </note> <pb n="37"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. II.] </note> <lb/>
            has any other animal mammæ that is not viviparous, nor <lb/>
            indeed all viviparous animals, but those only that are inter­ <lb/>
            nally viviparous, and not first of all oviparous. For the dol­ <lb/>
            phin is a viviparous animal, wherefore it has two mammæ, <lb/>
            not indeed above, but near the organs of reproduction. It <lb/>
            has not evident nipples, but, as it were, a stream flowing from <lb/>
            each side. From these the milk exudes, and the young ones <lb/>
            suck as they follow the mother. This has been distinctly <lb/>
            observed by some persons.</p>
          <p>2. But fish, as we have observed, have neither mammæ <lb/>
            nor any external passage for the genital organs. In the <lb/>
            branchia they have a distinctive organ, through which they <lb/>
            eject the water they have received into their mouths; and <lb/>
            they have fins, most fishes have four, but the long fishes, as <lb/>
            the eel, have only two placed near the branchia, and in this <lb/>
            respect the cestreus,1 a fish in the lake of Siphæ, is similar to <lb/>
            the eel,2 and so is the fish called tænia.3 Some of these <lb/>
            long fish have no fins, as the muræna, nor have they divided <lb/>
            branchia like other fish.</p>
          <p>3. Some fish with branchia have coverings over their bran­ <lb/>
            chia; in all the cartilaginous fishes they are uncovered. All <lb/>
            fishes that have coverings have the branchia placed on their <lb/>
            sides ; among the cartilaginous fishes some are broad in the <lb/>
            lowest part, as the narce4 and the batos ;5 some very long in <lb/>
            the sides, as all the galeodea.6 In the batracus,7 although the <lb/>
            branchia are on the sides, they are covered with a coriaceous, <lb/>
            not a prickly membrane, like those of fishes which are not <lb/>
            cartilaginous.</p>
          <p>4. In some fishes with branchia they are single, in others <lb/>
            double, but the last towards the body is always single. <lb/>
            Some have but few branchia, others have many; but their <lb/>
            number is always equal on both sides, and those with the <lb/>
            smallest number have always one on each side; this is <lb/>
            double in the capros ;8 others have two on each side, some­ <lb/>
            times these are single, sometimes double, as in the conger5 <lb/>
            and the scarus ;10 others have four simple branchia on each <lb/>
            side, as the ellops,11 synagris, muræna, and eel; others have <note type="footnote"> I Mugil, mullet. </note><note type="footnote">2 Muræna anguilla. </note><note type="footnote">3 Perhaps Cepola tænia. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Raia torpedo. </note><note type="footnote">6 Raia batos. </note><note type="footnote">6 The shark tribe. </note><note type="footnote">7 Lophius piscatorius. </note><note type="footnote">8 Perhaps Cottus cataphractus. </note><note type="footnote"> 9 Muraena conger. </note><note type="footnote">10 Scarus cretensis. </note><note type="footnote"> 11 Swordfish or sturgeon (L. and S. Lexicon), or Centriscus scolopax. </note> <pb n="38"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. II. </note> <lb/>
            four, all divided except the last, as the cichle,l perca, glanis,4 <lb/>
            and cyprinus ;4 all the galeodea have five double branchia on <lb/>
            each side, the xiphias5 has eight, which are double. This is <lb/>
            the manner and number of the branchia of fishes.</p>
          <p>5. And fish differ in other respects besides their gills, for <lb/>
            they have no hair like viviparous quadrupeds, nor scaly <lb/>
            plates like oviparous quadrupeds, nor feathers like birds, but <lb/>
            the greater number of them are covered with scales ; some of <lb/>
            them are rough, and a very few are smooth. Some cartila­ <lb/>
            ginous fishes are rough, others smooth. Congers, eels, and <lb/>
            tunnies are smooth. All fish except the scarus have pointed <lb/>
            teeth, and all have sharp teeth, some several rows of them, and <lb/>
            teeth on the tongue; they have also a hard prickly tongue, so <lb/>
            united to the mouth as sometimes to appear without a tongue.</p>
          <p>6. The mouth of some fishes is wide, like viviparous quad­ <lb/>
            rupeds. They have no external organs of sense, nor even <lb/>
            passages for smelling or hearing ; but all have eyes without <lb/>
            eyelids, though their eyes are not hard. All fishes are san­ <lb/>
            guineous ; some are oviparous, others viviparous; all those <lb/>
            that are covered with scales are oviparous. The cartilagi­ <lb/>
            nous fishes are all viviparous, except the batrachus.</p>

          <p>1. THE remaining class of sanguineous animals is that of <lb/>
            serpents ; these partake of both characters. The greater <lb/>
            portion of them inhabit the land, a few inhabiting water are <lb/>
            found in rivers. There are also serpents in the sea very like <lb/>
            those on land, except in their head, which is more like that <lb/>
            of the conger. There are many genera of sea-serpents, and <lb/>
            they are of all kinds of colours ; they do not exist in the <lb/>
            deepest part of the ocean. Serpents are apodal, like fishes.</p>
          <p>2. There are also marine scolopendræ,6 very like those on <lb/>
            land, but rather less; they live in rocky places ; in colour <lb/>
            they are redder, and they have more feet, and slighter legs <lb/>
            than in the terrestrial species. These also, like the ser­ <lb/>
            pents, are not found in deep places.</p>
          <p>3. And there is a small fish which lives among the rocks, <lb/>
            which some call echineis ;7 some people use it for trials <lb/>
            and philtres; it is not fit for food. Some people say it <note type="footnote"/><note type="footnote">1 A variegated fish. </note><note type="footnote">2 Perca fluviatilis. </note><note type="footnote">3 Silurus glania. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Cyprinus carpis, Carp. </note><note type="footnote">5 Xiphias gladius, Swordfish. </note><note type="footnote"> 0 Nereis, or aphrodite.

            <note type="margin"> B. II.] </note> <lb/>
            has feet, but it has none; the fins, however, are like feet, <lb/>
            which gives it this appearance. I have now described the <lb/>
            external parts of sanguineous animals, their nature, and their <lb/>
            number, and the differences which occur amongst them.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XI.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. FIRST of all we will speak of the internal parts of san­ <lb/>
            guineous animals, for the greatest number of genera differ <lb/>
            from other animals, some being sanguineous, others ex­ <lb/>
            sanguineous. The sanguineous genera are man, viviparous <lb/>
            and oviparous quadrupeds, birds, fishes, and whales, and <lb/>
            perhaps others that are anonymous, because they do not <lb/>
            form a genus, but simply species amongst each other, as the <lb/>
            serpent and the crocodile.</p>
          <p>2. All viviparous quadrupeds have an oesophagus and <lb/>
            trachea, situated as in man, and so have oviparous quadru­ <lb/>
            peds and birds, though there is some difference in the forma­ <lb/>
            tion of these parts; all that breathe by inhaling and exhaling <lb/>
            air have lungs, trachea, and oesophagus. The position of the <lb/>
            oesophagus and trachea, though similar, is not the same, nor <lb/>
            are the lungs alike in all, nor similar in position.</p>
          <p>3. All sanguineous animals have a heart, and a division <lb/>
            in the middle of the body, called a diaphragm. In small <lb/>
            animals its smallness and thinness render it less apparent. <lb/>
            The heart of the ox is peculiar; for there is a kind of ox, <lb/>
            though not the whole genus, which has a bone in its heart, <lb/>
            and there is also a bone in the heart of the horse.</p>
          <p>4. Not all animals have lungs, fish and those with gills have <lb/>
            no lungs. All sanguineous animals have a liver, generally a <lb/>
            spleen also ; but in oviparous animals that are not vivipa­ <lb/>
            rous, the spleen is so small as nearly to escape notice, as in <lb/>
            most birds, the pigeon, kite,1 hawk,2 and owl. The ægocepha­ <lb/>
            lus3 has none at all. Oviparous quadrupeds are of the same <lb/>
            nature, for they have a very small spleen, as the tortoise, <lb/>
            emys,4 phryne,6 lizard, crocodile, and frog.</p>
          <p>5. Some animals have a gall upon the liver, others none. <lb/>
            Among viviparous quadrupeds the stag6 has none, nor the <lb/>
            deer,' horse, mule, ass, seal, and some swine. The Achaïnian <lb/>
            stag appears to have the gall in the tail; that which they call <note type="footnote"> I Falco milvus. </note><note type="footnote">2 Falco palumbarius. </note><note type="footnote">3 Stryx otta. </note><note type="footnote">4 Testudo coriacea. </note><note type="footnote">6 Cervus elaphus. </note> <note type="footnote"> 7 Cervus capreolus, or C. Dams. </note> <pb n="40"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. II. </note> <lb/>
            gall in these animals resembles it in colour, but it is not liquid <lb/>
            like gall, but more like the spleen in its internal structure.</p>
          <p>6. All, while they are alive, have worms1 in the head; they <lb/>
            are produced in the hollow part under the hypoglottis, and <lb/>
            near the vertebrae, where the head is joined on. In size <lb/>
            they resemble very large maggots ; they are numerous, and <lb/>
            continuous, in number not generally more than twenty. <lb/>
            Stags, as I have observed, have no gall, but their intestines <lb/>
            are so bitter that dogs will not eat them if the deer are fat.</p>
          <p>7. The elephant also has a liver without a gall, but when <lb/>
            the part where the gall is attached in other animals, is cut <lb/>
            open, a quantity of fluid like bile, more or less abundant, runs <lb/>
            out. Among those animals which inhale sea-water, and have <lb/>
            lungs, the dolphin has no gall. All birds and fishes have <lb/>
            galls, and all oviparous quadrupeds, to speak of them at <lb/>
            once, have a gall, greater or less; but in some fishes it is <lb/>
            placed upon the liver, as the galeodea, glanis, rine,2 leio­ <lb/>
            batus,3 narce, and in some long fish, as the eel, belone,4 and <lb/>
            zygæna ;5 and the callionymus6 has a gall upon the liver, <lb/>
            larger in proportion to its size than any other fish. Others <lb/>
            have a gall upon the intestines, extending from the liver by <lb/>
            several thin passages; the amia7 has it stretched out upon <lb/>
            the intestines, and equal to them in length, and many times <lb/>
            folded upon it. Other fish have the gall upon the intes­ <lb/>
            tines, some at a greater, others at a less distance, as the <lb/>
            batrachus, elops, synagris, muraena, xiphias.</p>
          <p>8. And the same genus often appears to have the gall <lb/>
            extended in both directions, as the conger, in some indivi­ <lb/>
            duals it is turned towards the liver, in others suspended be­ <lb/>
            fore the liver. The same structure is observed in birds, for <lb/>
            some have the gall turned towards the stomach, and others <lb/>
            towards the entrails, as the pigeon, crow, quail, swallow, <lb/>
            sparrow; in others it is directed both towards the liver <lb/>
            and the stomach, as the aegocephalus ; in others, as the hawk <lb/>
            and kite, it is directed towards the liver and the intestines.</p>

            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. ALL viviparous quadrupeds have kidneys and a bladder, <lb/>
            but some oviparous animals have neither, as birds and <note type="footnote"> I Possibly CEstrus nasalis. </note><note type="footnote">2 Squalus squatina. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Raia batos. </note><note type="footnote">4 Syugnathus acus. </note><note type="footnote">5 Squalus zygæna. </note><note type="footnote"> 6 Uranoscopus seaber. </note><note type="footnote">7 A kind of marked scomber, mackerel ? </note> <pb n="41"/>

            fishes, and among oviparous quadrupeds the marine turtle <lb/>
            is the only one that has them at all proportionate to its size. <lb/>
            The marine turtle has the kidneys like those of oxen, and <lb/>
            that of the ox is like a great many kidneys joined together. <lb/>
            In all its internal parts, the bonassus1 is like the ox. -</p>
          <p>2. The position which these parts occupy is the same in all <lb/>
            animals, and the heart is in the middle of the body of all crea­ <lb/>
            tures, except man. In him it is inclined towards the left side; <lb/>
            and, as it was before observed, the apex of the heart is <lb/>
            directed forward in all, but in fishes it does not appear to <lb/>
            be so, for the apex of the heart is not directed towards the <lb/>
            chest, but towards the mouth and head, and the top of the <lb/>
            heart is suspended from the place where the right and left <lb/>
            branchia are joined to each other, and there are also other <lb/>
            passages which extend from the heart to each of the bran­ <lb/>
            chia, greater towards the larger branchia, and less towards <lb/>
            the smaller; but that to the top of the heart in great fishes <lb/>
            is a thick white tube.</p>
          <p>3. A few fishes, as the conger and the eel, have an œso­ <lb/>
            phagus, but even in these it is very small; in some of the <lb/>
            fish that have a liver, it is placed on the right side, and has <lb/>
            no lobes; in others, it is divided from the commencement, <lb/>
            and the greater part is on the right side. For in some fish <lb/>
            each part of the liver bangs down, and the divisions are not <lb/>
            united at their origin, as in the tribe of fish called galeodea, <lb/>
            and in a species of hare which is found near the lake of <lb/>
            Bolba, in the place called Sycine, and in other places, so <lb/>
            that one might suppose that they had two livers, on account <lb/>
            of the distances at which the passages unite, as in the lungs <lb/>
            of birds.</p>
          <p>4. In all animals the spleen is naturally situated on the <lb/>
            left side. The case has occurred that an animal having been <lb/>
            opened, has been observed to have the spleen on the right <lb/>
            side and the liver on the left, but such appearances are con­ <lb/>
            sidered ominous. In all animals the trachea reaches to the <lb/>
            lungs (its nature will be described in another place); and the <lb/>
            oesophagus, in all that have this part, reaches to the stomach <lb/>
            through the diaphragm. For most fishes (as I observed be­ <lb/>
            fore) have no oesophagus, but the stomach is united directly <lb/>
            with the mouth. So that it often happens that, when great <note type="footnote">1 Bos grunniens. </note> <pb n="42"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B. II."/> <lb/>
            fishes are pursuing small ones, the stomach falls forward <lb/>
            into the mouth.</p>
          <p>5. All the animals that have been mentioned have a <lb/>
            stomach, and in the same situation, for it is universally <lb/>
            placed under the diaphragm, and an intestine follows it, <lb/>
            and ends in the exit for the food which is called the anus. <lb/>
            But the stomach of different animals is variously formed, <lb/>
            for in the first place viviparous horned quadrupeds, which <lb/>
            have not teeth in both jaws, have four such passages, and <lb/>
            those animals are said to ruminate. For the oesophagus, <lb/>
            commencing in the mouth, extends to the parts just below the <lb/>
            lungs, and passes through the diaphragm to the great stomach.</p>
          <p>6. The internal part of this is rough, and folded to­ <lb/>
            gether ; and it is united, near the junction of the stomach, <lb/>
            to the part which, from its appearance, is called the net, <lb/>
            for the exterior is like a stomach, but the inside resembles <lb/>
            the meshes of a net; in point of size, the net is much less <lb/>
            than the stomach. Next to this is the part called echinus, <lb/>
            because internally it is rough and channelled; it is nearly <lb/>
            the same size as the net. Next to the echinus is the <lb/>
            enystrum, which is both larger and longer than the echinus, <lb/>
            and internally covered with many large and smooth folds; <lb/>
            after this are the entrails.</p>
          <p>7. This is the nature of the stomach of animals with horns, <lb/>
            and no teeth in the upper jaw. But they differ from each <lb/>
            other in the form and size of these parts; and because the <lb/>
            oesophagus is sometimes united to the middle, and some­ <lb/>
            times to the side of the stomach. Most animals which have <lb/>
            teeth in both jaws have but one stomach, as the man, dog, <lb/>
            bear, lion, and the wolf. The thos1 has all its intestines like a <lb/>
            wolf. All these have but one stomach, to which the bowel <lb/>
            is united. But in some of these the stomach is larger, as <lb/>
            the hog and the bear; that of the hog is marked with a <lb/>
            few smooth lines. In other animals the stomach is less, <lb/>
            not indeed much larger than the intestine, as the dog, lion, <lb/>
            and man. In the forms of their bowels other animals <lb/>
            are divided into two classes, resembling these types; for in <lb/>
            some the stomach resembles a dog's, in others a hog's, both <lb/>
            the greater and lesser animals in the same way; and the <lb/>
            stomachs of various animals differ in size, form, thickness, <lb/>
            thinness, and the position of the junction of the oesophagus. <note type="footnote"> 1 Felis onza, perhaps also canis aureus. </note> <pb n="43"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin"> B. II.] </note> 8. And the nature of the bowels differs in the before-named <lb/>
            animals, those, namely, which have not, and those which have <lb/>
            teeth in both jaws, in size, thickness, and folding. The intes­ <lb/>
            tines of the ruminants are all large, and so are the animals <lb/>
            themselves; there are a few small animals of this class, and <lb/>
            there is no horned animal which is very small. And. some <lb/>
            have appendages to the intestines, for none of the animals <lb/>
            with teeth in both jaws have straight intestines. There are <lb/>
            enlargements in the bowels of the elephant, which give it <lb/>
            the appearance of having four stomachs ; in these the food is <lb/>
            detained, and apart from these there is no receptacle for the <lb/>
            food. Its intestines are very like those of the hog, except <lb/>
            that the liver is four times greater than that of the ox, and <lb/>
            other parts also ; the spleen is small in proportion to its size.</p>
          <p>9. The stomach and intestines of oviparous quadrupeds <lb/>
            bear a similar proportion to each other, as in the land and <lb/>
            marine tortoise, the lizard, and both kinds of crocodiles,1 <lb/>
            and similar quadrupeds; for they have one simple stomach, <lb/>
            in some it is like that of the hog, in others like that of the <lb/>
            dog.</p>
          <p>10. The class of serpents in almost every part of their <lb/>
            body resemble the saurians, which have feet, and are ovi­ <lb/>
            parous, if we add to their length, and take away the feet; <lb/>
            for snakes are covered with scales, and have their upper <lb/>
            and lower parts like saurians, except that they have no tes­ <lb/>
            ticles, but, like fish, two passages united in one, and a <lb/>
            large and cloven uterus, but in other respects their in­ <lb/>
            testines are so like those of saurians, except that from <lb/>
            their elongated figure their intestines are long and narrow, <lb/>
            that they might be mistaken for them, from their similarity.</p>
          <p>11. For the trachea is very long, and the oesophagus still <lb/>
            longer, and the commencement of the trachea is close to <lb/>
            the mouth, so that the tongue appears to lie beneath it. <lb/>
            The trachea appears to be above the tongue because this <lb/>
            last can be retracted, and is not always in one position, as <lb/>
            in other animals. Their tongue is long, thin, and black, <lb/>
            and can be put forth for some distance. The tongue of <lb/>
            serpents and saurians is distinct from that of all other <lb/>
            animals, for the extremity of the tongue is cloven; this is <lb/>
            most remarkable in serpents, for the extremities of their <note type="footnote">1 Crocodilus niloticus and Lacerta stellio. </note> <pb n="44"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. II. </note> <lb/>
            tongues are like hairs. The seal also has a forked tongue. <lb/>
            The serpent has a stomach like a very wide entrail, like <lb/>
            that of the dog, afterwards a very long and thin intestine, <lb/>
            which is alike to its extremity.</p>
          <p>12. Behind the pharynx is a small kidney-shaped heart, <lb/>
            so that at times the apex does not appear to be directed <lb/>
            towards the chest, next to this is a single lung, divided by <lb/>
            a muscular passage, very long, and descending a long <lb/>
            distance from the breast. The liver is long and simple, <lb/>
            the spleen small and round, like that of the saurians. <lb/>
            The gall resembles that of fish, in water serpents it is <lb/>
            situated on the liver, in others generally upon the intes­ <lb/>
            tines. They all have pointed teeth, and as many ribs as <lb/>
            there are days in the month, for they have thirty. Some <lb/>
            persons say that in one respect serpents resemble the <lb/>
            young of the swallow, for if their eyes are pierced with a <lb/>
            pointed instrument, they will grow again, and if the tails of <lb/>
            serpents or lizards be cut off, they will be reproduced.</p>
          <p>13. The same remarks will apply to the intestines and <lb/>
            stomachs of fishes, for they have one simple stomach, <lb/>
            but it differs in form, for in some fishes it is like a bowel, <lb/>
            as in the one called scarus, and this is the only fish that <lb/>
            appears to ruminate, and the size of the intestines is <lb/>
            simple and folded together, for it can be resolved into one, <lb/>
            by unfolding it. The appendages of the stomach appear <lb/>
            to be peculiar to fishes and birds, for birds have them <lb/>
            above the stomach, and few in number, but in fish they <lb/>
            are above, and around the stomach. Some have many ap­ <lb/>
            pendages, as the gobius,1 galeus,2 perca, scorpios,3 citharus,4 <lb/>
            trigla,6 and sparus.6 But the cestreus has many on one side <lb/>
            of the stomach, and only one on the other. Some have <lb/>
            only a few, as the hepatus7 and the glaucus,8 and the cbry­ <lb/>
            sophrys9 also has only a few, but some individuals differ <lb/>
            from others, for one chrysophrys has many, another has <lb/>
            only a few. There are some fish which have none of them, <lb/>
            as most of the cartilaginous genera; others have a few, <lb/>
            and some a great many, and all fish have these appendages <lb/>
            very near the stomach itself. <note type="footnote"> I Gobio, gudgeon. </note><note type="footnote">2 Shark. </note><note type="footnote">3 Cottus scorpius. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Probably Pleuronectes rhombus. </note><note type="footnote">5 Mullus stirrnulentus. </note><note type="footnote"> 6 Sparus mains. </note><note type="footnote">7 Theutis hepatus. </note><note type="footnote">8 Probably Gobio gozo. </note> <note type="footnote"> 9 Sparus aurata. </note> <pb n="45"/>

          <p><note type="margin"> B. II.] </note> 14. Birds have their internal parts different from each <lb/>
            other and from other animals ; for some have before the <lb/>
            stomach a crop, as the domestic fowl, pigeon, dove, and <lb/>
            partridge. The crop is a large and hollow skin, into which <lb/>
            the food is received before it is digested. Hence from the <lb/>
            oesophagus it is narrower, then wider, and where it descends <lb/>
            into the stomach it is smaller.</p>
          <p>15. In most birds the stomach is fleshy and thick, and on <lb/>
            the outside there is a strong skin, which is separated from <lb/>
            the fleshy part. Some birds have no crop, but instead of <lb/>
            it a wide oesophagus, either wholly so, or in the part extend­ <lb/>
            ing to the stomach, as in the colceus,1 raven, and crow. <lb/>
            The quail has the lower part of the oesophagus broad, the <lb/>
            segocephalus has it small but wider, and so has the owl. <lb/>
            But the duck, goose, gull, diver, and bustard, have a wide <lb/>
            and broad oesophagus, and so have many other birds.</p>
          <p>16. And some have a part of the stomach itself like a <lb/>
            crop, as the cenchreis ;2 and there are some which have <lb/>
            neither oesophagus nor a wide crop, but a large stomach; <lb/>
            these are small birds like the swallow, and the sparrow. <lb/>
            A few have neither a crop, nor a wide oesophagus, but a <lb/>
            very long one ; these are birds with a long neck, as the por­ <lb/>
            phyrion.3 Almost all these emit a moister excrement than <lb/>
            other birds.</p>
          <p>17. The quail has these peculiarities, for it has a crop, and <lb/>
            before the stomach a wide and broad oesophagus. And the <lb/>
            crop is at a great distance from the part of the oesophagus <lb/>
            before the belly, considering the size of the bird. Birds <lb/>
            have generally a small intestine, which is single when un­ <lb/>
            folded, and birds have appendages, a few, as I have said, and <lb/>
            not placed above, as in fish, but below, near the end of the <lb/>
            intestine. Some birds have not these appendages, though <lb/>
            they generally have them, as the domestic fowl, partridge, <lb/>
            duck, night-raven,4 localus,5 ascalaphus,6 goose, bustard, <lb/>
            owl. Some of the small birds have them, but they are very <lb/>
            minute, as the sparrow. <note type="footnote"> 1 Three kinds of birds are called by this name. Corvus graculus, <lb/>

          <p>1. WE have treated of the other internal parts of animals, <lb/>
            their number, their nature and varieties. It now remains for <lb/>
            us to speak of the organs of generation. In females these are <lb/>
            always internal; but there is much difference in males, for <lb/>
            some sanguineous animals have no testicles at all, in others <lb/>
            they are internal; and in some animals with internal tes­ <lb/>
            ticles, they are placed near the kidneys, in others near the <lb/>
            abdomen; in other animals they are external. The penis <lb/>
            of these last is sometimes united to the abdomen, in others <lb/>
            it is loose as well as the testicles; but in promingent and <lb/>
            retromingent animals it is suspended from the abdomen <lb/>
            in a different manner. Neither fish nor any other animal <lb/>
            with gills, nor the whole class of serpents, have testicles; <lb/>
            neither has any apodal animal which is not internally vivi­ <lb/>
            parous.</p>
          <p>2. Birds have testicles, but they are internal and near <lb/>
            the loins, and so have oviparous quadrupeds, as the lizard, <lb/>
            tortoise, and crocodile, and among viviparous animals, the <lb/>
            hedgehog. In some viviparous animals they are situated in­ <lb/>
            ternally upon the abdomen, as the dolphin among apodal <lb/>
            creatures, and the elephant among quadrupeds. In other <lb/>
            animals the testicles are external. It has been previously <lb/>
            observed, that the manner and position of their junction with <lb/>
            the abdomen is various, for in some they are joined on and do <lb/>
            not hang down, as in swine, in others they hang down as in <lb/>
            man.</p>
          <p>3. It has also been observed that neither fishes nor serpents <lb/>
            have testicles, but they have two passages hanging down on <lb/>
            each side of the spine from the diaphragm, and these unite <lb/>
            in one passage above the anus, by above, we mean nearer <lb/>
            the Spinal column. At the season of coition these passages <lb/>
            are full of semen, which exudes on pressure; the differences <pb n="47"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. III. ] </note> <lb/>
            among these may be seen by dissection, and in another place <lb/>
            they will each be considered more particularly.</p>
          <p>4. All oviparous animals, whether bipeds or quadrupeds, <lb/>
            have their testicles placed in the loins below the diaphragm, <lb/>
            some of a white colour, others ochreous, but in all sur­ <lb/>
            rounded with small veins; from each of these a passage is <lb/>
            produced, which afterwards become united in one, and, as <lb/>
            in fish, open near the anus. This is the penis, which is in­ <lb/>
            conspicuous in small animals; but in the larger, as the goose <lb/>
            and such like, it becomes more conspicuous immediately <lb/>
            after coition.</p>
          <p>5. And these passages, both in fish and other animals, <lb/>
            are joined to the loins below the stomach and between the <lb/>
            entrails and the great vein, from which passages proceed to <lb/>
            each of the kidneys; and, as in fish, the semen may be seen <lb/>
            entering them at the period of coition, when these passages <lb/>
            become very conspicuous, but when this season is passed <lb/>
            the passages again become invisible. So also the testicles <lb/>
            of birds are either small or entirely invisible when not excited, <lb/>
            but when urged by desire they become very large ; this is so <lb/>
            remarkable in pigeons and partridges, that some persons <lb/>
            have supposed that they had no testicles during winter.</p>
          <p>6. In some of those animals in which the testicles are placed <lb/>
            forwards, they are internal and upon the abdomen, as in the <lb/>
            dolphin; in others they are externally conspicuous upon the <lb/>
            extremity of the abdomen. These animals are similar in <lb/>
            other respects, but differ in this, for in some the testicles <lb/>
            are uncovered, and others that have external testes they are <lb/>
            placed in a scrotum.</p>
          <p>7. This is the nature of the testicles of all viviparous ani­ <lb/>
            mals with feet: from the aorta, passages like veins proceed <lb/>
            to the bead of each testicle, and two others from the kidneys, <lb/>
            these last are full of blood, but those from the aorta con­ <lb/>
            tain no blood. From the head of each testicle to the tes­ <lb/>
            ticle itself, there proceeds a thicker and more muscular pas­ <lb/>
            sage, which is in each testicle reflected back to the head of <lb/>
            the testicle, and from this point they again unite upon the <lb/>
            penis towards the fore-part of it.</p>
          <p>8. And both these passages which are reflected back upon <lb/>
            themselves, and those which are seated upon the testicles, <lb/>
            are covered with the same membrane as the testes them- <pb n="48"/>

            selves, so that unless this membrane is taken away, they all <lb/>
            appear to be one passage. These last passages, which are <lb/>
            seated upon the testicle, contain sanguineous fluid, but less <lb/>
            than those above from the aorta; but in the reflected <lb/>
            passages of the duct which is upon the penis, the fluid is <lb/>
            white. A passage also leads from the bladder, and is united <lb/>
            to the upper part of this duct, which is enclosed in the part <lb/>
            called the penis as in a husk. The accompanying diagram <lb/>
            will illustrate the position of these parts.</p>
          <p>9. The origin of the passage from the trachea, a ; the head <lb/>
            of the testes and the descending passages, b b ; the passages <lb/>

            dd; the penis, e; the bladder, f ; the testicles, g g. But <lb/>
            when the testicles are cut out or otherwise destroyed, the <lb/>
            upper passages are retracted ; in young animals castration <lb/>
            is performed by bruising the testicles, in older animals by <lb/>
            excision. And it has happened that a bull has begotten <lb/>
            young if admitted to the female immediately after castra­ <lb/>
            tion. This is the nature of the testicles of animals.</p>
          <p>10. The uterus of the females that possess this organ is not <lb/>
            of the same nature, nor alike in all, but they differ from <lb/>
            each other both in viviparous and oviparous animals. The <lb/>
            uterus is double in all those animals in which it is situated <lb/>
            near the external organ of generation, one part lying on the <lb/>
            right side, the other on the left, but the origin is one, and <lb/>
            there is but one os uteri, which is like a very fleshy tube, <lb/>
            and in most animals, especially those of a large size, it is <lb/>
            cartilaginous. One part of this organ is called the uterus <lb/>
            and delphys (whence the word adelphi, brothers), and the <lb/>
            vagina and os uteri are called metra.</p>
          <p>11. In all viviparous animals, whether bipeds or quadru­ <lb/>
            peds, the uterus is placed below the diaphragm, as in the <lb/>
            human female, the bitch, sow, mare, and cow, and it is the <lb/>
            same in all homed animals. At the extremity of the uterus <lb/>
            most animals have a convoluted part called the horns ; these <lb/>
            are not distinct in all oviparous animals ; but in some birds <lb/>
            they are placed near the diaphragm, and in some fishes <lb/>
            below, as in the viviparous bipeds and quadrupeds. But <lb/>
            they are thin, membranaceous, and long, so that in very small <lb/>
            fish each part of the roe appears as one ovum, as if the fish <pb n="49"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. III.] </note> <lb/>
            which are said to have a crumbling roe had but two ova, for <lb/>
            it is not one ovum but many, and therefore it may be resolved <lb/>
            into many.</p>
          <p>12. In the uterus of birds the vagina is below, fleshy and <lb/>
            tough, but the part near the diaphragm membranaceous and <lb/>
            very thin, so that the eggs appear to be outside the uterus. <lb/>
            In large birds the membrane is more conspicuous, and if <lb/>
            inflated through the vagina, it swells and enlarges at places ; <lb/>
            in small birds these parts are not conspicuous. The uterus <lb/>
            of oviparous quadrupeds, as the tortoise, lizard, frog, and <lb/>
            such like, is of the same nature, for the vagina below is one <lb/>
            and fleshy, but the division and the ova are higher up and <lb/>
            near the diaphragm.</p>
          <p>13. In those apodal creatures which are outwardly vivi­ <lb/>
            parous and inwardly oviparous, as the sharks and selachea <lb/>
            —[The selachea are apodal, furnished with gills, and vivi­ <lb/>
            parous]—the uterus is divided, and as in birds, it com­ <lb/>
            mences below and extends towards the diaphragm. The <lb/>
            ova are situated between the division, and above near the <lb/>
            diaphragm; and the animal is produced from the ovum after <lb/>
            this has descended into the open space.</p>
          <p>14. The difference between the uteri of these fish and <lb/>
            others may be studied more accurately in drawings of dis­ <lb/>
            sections. Serpents also differ much both among themselves <lb/>
            and from other animals, for all serpents except the viper are <lb/>
            oviparous; this one is viviparous, though at first internally <lb/>
            oviparous, wherefore, in many respects, its uterus resembles <lb/>
            that of the cartilaginous fishes. The uterus of the serpent <lb/>
            is long, like the body, and descends downwards, beginning <lb/>
            from one duct and continuing on either side of the spine as <lb/>
            far as the diaphragm, as if each were a passage, in which the <lb/>
            ova are placed in order ; these ova are not extruded singly, <lb/>
            but connected together like a chain.</p>
          <p>15. In all animals that are either internally or externally <lb/>
            viviparous, the uterus is situated above the abdomen; in all <lb/>
            oviparous creatures it is placed below, near the loins. Those <lb/>
            that are externally viviparous, but internally oviparous, par­ <lb/>
            take of both characters, for the lower part in which the ova <lb/>
            are situated is near the loins, the other part whence the ova <lb/>
            are extruded above the intestines. And there is also this <lb/>
            difference in the uteri of animals: those which have home <note type="footnote"> E </note> <pb n="50"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B III. </note> <lb/>
            and not teeth in both jaws have cotyledons in the pregnant <lb/>
            uterus, and some of those also with teeth in both jaws, as the <lb/>
            hare, the mouse, and the bat. But other viviparous animals <lb/>
            with teeth in both jaws, and with feet, have a smooth uterus. <lb/>
            The embryo is not united to the cotyledon, but to the <lb/>
            womb. This is the manner of the internal and external <lb/>
            heterogeneous parts of animals.</p>

          <p>1. OF the homogeneous parts of animals, the blood is com­ <lb/>
            mon to sanguineous animals ; and so is the part in which it <lb/>
            is contained, which is called a vein; analogous to these, in <lb/>
            exsanguineous animals are the serum and the fibre. That <lb/>
            which especially constitutes the body is flesh or its analogue : <lb/>
            the bone and its analogue; the spine and the cartilage. <lb/>
            Next to this we place the skin, membranes, sinews, hair, <lb/>
            nails, and their analogue ; after these, adeps, fat, and excre­ <lb/>
            mentitious matters; then are faeces, phlegm, and bile, both <lb/>
            the yellow and the black.</p>
          <p>2. But inasmuch as the blood and the veins seem to <lb/>
            occupy the chief place, we will first of all speak of these, <lb/>
            both for other reasons, and because former writers do not <lb/>
            appear to have described them rightly. The difficulty of <lb/>
            understanding them is the reason of their errors, for in <lb/>
            dead animals, the nature of the principal veins is obscure, <lb/>
            for they collapse as soon as the blood has escaped, and it <lb/>
            pours out of them as from a vessel. No part of the body, <lb/>
            except the veins, contains any blood, except the heart, which <lb/>
            has a little ; but it is all in the veins. In living creatures <lb/>
            their nature cannot be distinguished, for they are internal, <lb/>
            and out of sight; so that those who consider them only in <lb/>
            dead and dissected animals, cannot see their principal ori­ <lb/>
            gins. But some, by the examination of emaciated persons, <lb/>
            have distinguished the origin of the veins, from the appear­ <lb/>
            ance of those which are external.</p>
          <p>3. For Syennesis,1 a Cyprian physician, speaks thus: <lb/>
            " The larger veins are thus constituted. From the navel <lb/>
            around the loins, through the back to the lungs, under the <lb/>
            breasts ; that from the right to the left, and that from the <note type="footnote">1 Syennesis, a physician of Cyprus. Very little is known of hiin ; <lb/>
            he must have lived in or before the fourth century B.C. </note> <pb n="51"/>

            left to the right. That from the left, through the liver to <lb/>
            the kidney and the testicle; that from the right to the spleen, <lb/>
            the kidney, and the testicle, and from thence to the penis."</p>
          <p>4. Diogenes1 of Apollonia writes thus: " The veins are <lb/>
            thus placed in man. There are two very large ones, which <lb/>
            extend through the stomach by the spine of the back, one <lb/>
            to the right and the other to the left, each to the leg nearest <lb/>
            itself, and upwards to the head by the collar-bone, and through <lb/>
            the neck. From these great veins others extend through the <lb/>
            whole of the body, from the right to the right side, and from <lb/>
            the left to the left side. The largest are two from the heart, <lb/>
            surrounding the spine of the back ; and others, a little higher <lb/>
            up, through the breasts under the arm-pits, each to the hand <lb/>
            nearest itself; and the one is called the splenetic, the other <lb/>
            the hepatic vein.</p>
          <p>5. " The extremity of these veins is divided, one branch <lb/>
            goes to the thumb, and another to the wrist, and from these <lb/>
            many small branches are extended upon each band, and the <lb/>
            fingers; and others, smaller still, branch off from these first <lb/>
            veins, from the right side to the liver, from the left to the <lb/>
            spleen and kidneys. The veins, which go to the legs, are <lb/>
            divided near the junction, and extend through the whole <lb/>
            thigh; but the largest of these extends to the back of the <lb/>
            thigh, and appears thick; another, less thick, passes through <lb/>
            the inside of the thigh, and afterwards veins extend by the <lb/>
            knee to the leg and foot. As on the hands, they are distri­ <lb/>
            buted upon the tarsus of the foot, and from thence to the toes.</p>
          <p>6. "A number of small veins are distributed on the <lb/>
            stomach and the lungs. Those that extend to the head, <lb/>
            through the jugular region, appear large in the neck. From <lb/>
            the extremity of each of these many veins are distributed <lb/>
            upon the head, some on the right side to the left, others on <lb/>
            the left side to the right, they all end near the ear. And <lb/>
            there is a second vein upon the neck on each side, some­ <lb/>
            what less than the other, to which the principal veins of <lb/>
            the neck are united. These pass inwards, through the <lb/>
            neck, and from each of them veins pass beneath the <lb/>
            shoulder-blade and to the hands ; and near the splenetic and <note type="footnote">1 Diogenes of Apollonia was an eminent natural philosopher of Crete, <lb/>

            hepatic veins there appear others a little less, which they <lb/>
            divide when any disease attacks the skin; but the hepatic <lb/>
            and splenetic veins are divided for any disease in the neigh­ <lb/>
            bourhood of the stomach.</p>
          <p>7. Other veins pass from these, beneath the breasts <lb/>
            and there are other small ones, which proceed from each o <lb/>
            these through the spinal marrow to the testicles, and others <lb/>
            beneath the skin, through the flesh, reach the kidneys; ii <lb/>
            men they terminate upon the testicles, in women on the <lb/>
            uterus. The first veins from the stomach are wider, and <lb/>
            afterwards become smaller, until they pass over from the <lb/>
            right to the left, and from the left to the right; these an <lb/>
            called the spermatic veins. The thickest blood is beneatl <lb/>
            the flesh, but that which is in excess in these places be. <lb/>
            comes thin, and warm, and frothy." These are the opinions <lb/>
            of Syennesis and Diogenes.</p>
          <p>8. Polybus1 writes thus : " There are four pair of veins, one <lb/>
            from the back of the bead through the neck, on the outside, <lb/>
            near the spine on either side, as far as the thighs and the <lb/>
            legs, afterwards through the legs to the ancles, on the out­ <lb/>
            side, and to the feet. Wherefore, in complaints of the back <lb/>
            and thigh, they divide the veins upon the poplitic region, or <lb/>
            ancles, on the outside. Another pair of veins pass from the <lb/>
            head, by the ears, through the neck, these are called the <lb/>
            jugular veins; and others within, near the spine, lead by the <lb/>
            loins to the testicles and the thighs, and through the poplitic <lb/>
            region on the inside, and through the leg to the inner part <lb/>
            of the ancle, and the feet; wherefore, in complaints of the <lb/>
            loins and testicles, they bleed in the poplitic region and ancles.</p>
          <p>9. " The third pair of veins, from the temple through the <lb/>
            neck, and beneath the scapula, reach the lungs; those from <lb/>
            the right to the left, under the breast, to the spleen and <lb/>
            kidneys; and those from the left to the right side, from the <lb/>
            lungs, under the breast, and liver, and kidney; and both <lb/>
            end beneath the testicles. The fourth pair from the forepart <lb/>
            of the head and the eyes, under the neck and collar-bones <lb/>
            from thence they extend through the humerus to the elbow <lb/>
            and through the cubitus to the wrist and the fingers, and <lb/>

          <p>1. TIlE opinions of other persons are nearly these; and <lb/>
            there are other physiologists, but they have not treated so <lb/>
            accurately of the veins. But all agree in placing their <lb/>
            origin in the head and brain, in which they are incorrect. <lb/>
            But, as I have remarked before, it is difficult to discern the <lb/>
            course of the veins; indeed, it is impossible to understand <lb/>
            them unless a person will examine animals which, after <lb/>
            emaciation, have been killed by strangulation. The follow­ <lb/>
            ing is the nature of the veins : There are two veins in the <lb/>
            interior of the chest, near the spine ; the larger of these is <lb/>
            placed forward, the smaller is behind; the larger is inclined <lb/>
            to the right side, the smaller to the left; and this by some <lb/>
            persons is called the aorta, from the sinewy portion which <lb/>
            is seen in dead animals.</p>
          <p>2. These veins have their origin in the heart, for they <lb/>
            pass completely through the other intestines, and always <lb/>
            preserve the character of veins. The heart is, as it were, a <lb/>
            part of them, and especially of the more forward and larger <lb/>
            one, for these veins are above and below, and the heart is in <lb/>
            the middle of them. The heart of all animals contains cavi­ <lb/>
            ties, but in the heart of very small animals the largest cavity is <lb/>
            scarcely perceptible, in moderately sized animals the second <lb/>
            cavity is scarcely visible, but in large animals they are all <lb/>
            three distinct enough. And when the apex of the heart is <lb/>
            turned forwards, as I have observed, the principal cavity is <lb/>
            on the right side, and above it the least is on the left side, <lb/>
            and the middle-sized one is between them; the two smaller <lb/>
            are far less than the greater.</p>
          <p>3. All these are perforated towards the lungs, but im­ <lb/>
            perceptibly so from the minuteness of the passage, except <lb/>
            in one place. The great vein is suspended from the upper <lb/>
            portion of the principal cavity, and on the right side ; after­ <lb/>
            wards through the cavity a vein extends again, as if the <lb/>
            vein were a part of the cavity in which the blood stagnates. <lb/>
            The aorta has its origin from the middle cavity, but in a dif­ <lb/>
            ferent manner from the vein, for it communicates with the <lb/>
            heart by a much narrower past age, and the vein is continued <pb n="54"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. III.</note> <lb/>
            through the heart. But the aorta passes from the heart, and <lb/>
            the great vein is membranous and like skin, but the aorta is <lb/>
            narrow and very sinewy, and as it is continued towards the <lb/>
            head and the lower parts of the body, it becomes narrow and <lb/>
            quite sinewy.</p>
          <p>4. A portion of the great vein is first of all extended up­ <lb/>
            wards from the heart to the lung, and to the junction of <lb/>
            the aorta, this vein being undivided and large; from this <lb/>
            place it divides into two branches, the one towards the lung, <lb/>
            and the other to the spine and the lowest vertebra of the <lb/>
            neck. The branch which goes to the lungs is first divided <lb/>
            into two branches, and afterwards it is continued upon every <lb/>
            tube and passage of the lungs, greater to the greater, and <lb/>
            less to the less, so as to leave no part in which there is not <lb/>
            a passage and a small vein. These last are invisible from their <lb/>
            minute size, so that the whole lung seems to be full of blood.</p>
          <p>5. And the passages from the vein are above the tubes which <lb/>
            extend from the trachea. And the vein which is continued <lb/>
            upon the vertebra of the neck, and upon the spinal column, <lb/>
            returns again to the spine, as Homer writes in his poems : "He <lb/>
            cut off the whole vein which passes up the back and returns <lb/>
            again to the neck;"1 and from this vein branches extend to each <lb/>
            rib and to each vertebra; but that which is upon the vertebra <lb/>
            near the kidneys branches in two directions. These branches, <lb/>
            then, of the great vein are subdivided in this manner.</p>
          <p>6. And above these, from that part which is continued from <lb/>
            the heart, the whole is again divided into two directions, for <lb/>
            some reach to the sides and the clavicles, and afterwards <lb/>
            through the armpits to the arms, in the human subject, but <lb/>
            in quadrupeds to the fore-legs, to the wings in birds, and to <lb/>
            the pectoral fins in fishes. The commencements of these veins, <lb/>
            when they are first of all divided, are called jugular veins; <lb/>
            and having branched off in the neck from the great vein, they <lb/>
            are continued to the trachea of the lungs. And if these <lb/>
            veins are held on the outside, men fall down dead with in­ <lb/>
            sensibility, with closed eyes, but without choking.</p>
          <p>7. Extending in this manner, and. receiving the trachea <lb/>
            between them, they reach the place where the jaws unite <lb/>
            with the head; and again from this point they are divided <lb/>
            into four veins, one of which bends backwards and descends <note type="footnote">1 Iliad. xiii. 546. </note> <pb n="55"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. III.]</note> <lb/>
            through the neck and shoulder, and meets the first division <lb/>
            of the vein by the joint of the arm; the other portion ter­ <lb/>
            minates in the hand and fingers; and another branch ex­ <lb/>
            tends from each part near the ear to the brain, where it <lb/>
            is divided into many small branches upon the membrane <lb/>
            which surrounds the brain.</p>
          <p>8. The brain never contains blood in any animal, nor does <lb/>
            any vein, small or great, terminate upon it; but some of <lb/>
            the other branches that extend from this vein surround the <lb/>
            brain in a circle, and others, end upon the organs of sense <lb/>
            and the teeth in very small veins. In the same manner, <lb/>
            also, the branches of the smaller vein, which is called the <lb/>
            aorta, are divided: they are continued beside those of the <lb/>
            great vein, but the tubes are smaller and the branches less <lb/>
            than those of the great vein.</p>

          <p>1. THE veins, then, are thus distributed in the parts above <lb/>
            the heart, but the part of the great vein which is below the <lb/>
            heart passes through the middle of the diaphragm, and is <lb/>
            united to the aorta and spinal column by membranous flaccid <lb/>
            passages. From this a short and wide vein passes through <lb/>
            the liver, from which many similar branches extend to the <lb/>
            liver, and disappear upon it. There are two branches of the <lb/>
            vein, one of which terminates upon the diaphragm, and what <lb/>
            is called the præcordia, the other returns through the arm- <lb/>
            pit to the right arm, and unites with the other veins near <lb/>
            the interior part of the elbow. For this reason physicians <lb/>
            treat certain diseases of the liver by venesection in this vein.</p>
          <p>2. From the left of this there is a short and wide vein, <lb/>
            which reaches to the spleen, and the branches of this vein <lb/>
            are lost upon this organ, and another portion branching off <lb/>
            in the same way from the left the great vein passes up to <lb/>
            the left arm, except that the last-mentioned pass through <lb/>
            the liver, but this one through the spleen. Other branches <lb/>
            also separate from the great vein, the one to the omentum, <lb/>
            the other to the pancreas; and from this many veins extend <lb/>
            through the mesenterium, and all end there in one great <lb/>
            vein, which passes through the whole intestine and the <lb/>
            stomach, as far as the oesophagus; and many veins branch <lb/>
            off from them around these parts. <pb n="56"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. III.</note></p>
          <p>3. Both the aorta and the great vein continue as far as <lb/>
            the kidney each as a single duct; from this point they are <lb/>
            more closely united to the spinal column, and are each di­ <lb/>
            vided into two parts, like the letter lambda (A), and the <lb/>
            great vein is placed farther back than the aorta. The <lb/>
            aorta is more closely united to the spinal column, near the <lb/>
            neart, and the junction is formed by small sinewy veins.</p>
          <p>4. The aorta leaves the heart as a large hollow passage, <lb/>
            but as it advances it becomes narrower and more sinewy. <lb/>
            From the aorta, veins extend also to the mesenterium, like <lb/>
            those from the great vein, but far inferior in size, for they are <lb/>
            narrow and muscular. They terminate in small hollow <lb/>
            muscular veins. No branch of the aorta extends to the <lb/>
            liver and the spleen, but the branches of either vein extend <lb/>
            to each hip, and both touch upon the bone. Branches <lb/>
            reach the kidney both from the great vein and the aorta; <lb/>
            they do not, however, enter the cavity, but are taken up in <lb/>
            the substance of the kidney.</p>
          <p>5. Two other strong and continuous passages reach from <lb/>
            the aorta to the bladder, and others from the cavity of <lb/>
            the kidney; but these do not communicate with the <lb/>
            great vein. From the centre of each kidney a hollow <lb/>
            sinewy vein passes through the other veins to the spinal <lb/>
            column; first of all they disappear upon each hip, and <lb/>
            then appear again in branches towards the hip ; their ex­ <lb/>
            tremities are distributed upon the bladder and penis in <lb/>
            the male, and upon the uterus in the female; no branch <lb/>
            of the great vein passes to the uterus, but many and thick <lb/>
            ones reach it from the aorta.</p>
          <p>6. From the aorta and great vein branches are distributed <lb/>
            to the nates; at first they are large and hollow, afterwards <lb/>
            they pass through the legs, ending upon the feet and toes ; <lb/>
            and others again pass through the nates and thighs, alter­ <lb/>
            nately from right to left, and they join with other veins <lb/>
            below the knees.</p>
          <p>7. The nature and origin of the veins are evident from this <lb/>
            description. In all sanguineous animals, the nature and origin <lb/>
            of the principal veins are the same, but the multitude of smaller <lb/>
            veins is not alike in all, for neither are the parts of the same <lb/>
            nature, nor do all possess the same parts. Nor are the veins <lb/>
            equally apparent in all animals; but they are more manifest in <pb n="57"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. III.] </note> <lb/>
            those which have most blood, and in the largest creatures; but <lb/>
            in those animals which are small, and have not much blood, <lb/>
            either by nature or from excess in fat, they are not so easily <lb/>
            investigated, for some of the passages are confused, like <lb/>
            rivulets that are lost in beds of mud ; and there are some <lb/>
            animals which have but few, and these fibres instead of veins. <lb/>
            The great vein is very conspicuous in all, even the smallest <lb/>
            animals.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER V.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. THE following is the nature of the sinews of animals. <lb/>
            The origin of these, also, is in the breast, for there is a <lb/>
            sinew in the principal cavity of the heart itself; and that <lb/>
            which is called the aorta is a sinewy vein, for its termina­ <lb/>
            tions are always sinewy, for they are not hollow, and are <lb/>
            extensible, like the sinews which end upon the bending of <lb/>
            the bones: for it is not the nature of sinews to be con­ <lb/>
            tinuous from one origin, like the veins, for the veins have <lb/>
            the whole form of the body as in outline sketches, so that <lb/>
            in emaciated subjects the whole mass appears full of veins, <lb/>
            for the same place is occupied by veins in lean persons that <lb/>
            in fat ones is flesh.</p>
          <p>2. The sinews are drawn round the joints and flexures of <lb/>
            the bones ; but, if their nature were continuous, the con­ <lb/>
            tinuation would be evident in emaciated persons. The <lb/>
            principal parts of the sinews are around the part of the <lb/>
            body appropriated to leaping, and this is called the poples. <lb/>
            Another double sinew is the tendon of the neck, and the epi­ <lb/>
            tonus and the sinew of the shoulder, which aid in the support <lb/>
            of the body. The sinews around the joints have not re­ <lb/>
            ceived any name, for all the bones where they are contiguous <lb/>
            are bound together by the sinews.</p>
          <p>3. And there are many sinews round all the bones ; there <lb/>
            are none in the head; but the sutures of the skull are <lb/>
            adapted to each other. It is the nature of sinew to tear <lb/>
            readily lengthwise, but across the fibre it is indivisible, <lb/>
            and it is very extensible. The sinews are surrounded by <lb/>
            a mucous, white, and gelatinous fluid, by which they are <lb/>
            nourished, and from which they seem to derive their origin. <lb/>
            The vein does not alter its form by combustion, but the <lb/>
            sinew is entirely destroyed. Neither does it unite after <lb/>
            division. <pb n="58"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin"> [B. III. </note> 4. Numbness does not take place in those parts of the <lb/>
            body which contain no sinews. The sinews are most abund­ <lb/>
            ant on the hands and feet, and on the ribs and shoulder- <lb/>
            blades, and round the neck and arms. All sanguineous <lb/>
            animals have sinews ; but in those which have not jointed <lb/>
            limbs, and are without feet and hands, the sinews are small <lb/>
            and inconspicuous, so that in fishes they are most distinct <lb/>
            near the fins.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER VI.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. THE fibres are between the sinews and the veins; but <lb/>
            some of them are moistened with serum, and they extend <lb/>
            from the sinews to the veins, and from the veins to the <lb/>
            sinews. There is also another kind of fibre, which is pro­ <lb/>
            duced in the blood of most, but not of all animals. When <lb/>
            this is extracted from the blood, it does not coagulate, but <lb/>
            if it is not taken out of the blood it coagulates. These <lb/>
            fibres are present in the blood of most animals, but not in <lb/>
            that of the stag, prox,' and bubalis,2 and some others; so <lb/>
            that their blood does not coagulate like that of other <lb/>
            animals: the blood of stags is very like that of hares; <lb/>
            for in both of these coagulation takes place; not firm, as <lb/>
            in other animals, but trembling, liKe that of milk, if no co­ <lb/>
            agulating substance is put into it. The blood of the <lb/>
            bubalis coagulates more thickly, only a little less so than <lb/>
            that of sheep. This is the nature of veins, sinews, and <lb/>
            fibres.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER VII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. THE bones of animals depend upon one bone, and are <lb/>
            connected with each other, like the veins; and there is no <lb/>
            such thing as a separate bone. In all animals with bones <lb/>
            the spinal column is their origin. The spinal column is <lb/>
            made up of vertebrae, and extends from the head to the hips. <lb/>
            All the vertebrae are perforated; the upper part of the <lb/>
            head is a bone joined to the last vertebra, and is called the <lb/>
            skull, the saw-like part is the suture.</p>
          <p>2. This is not alike in all animals, for the cranium of <lb/>
            some consists of a single bone, as in the dog; in others it <lb/>
            is compound, as in the human subject. The female has <note type="footnote">1 Cervis Capreolus, or C. dams. </note><note type="footnote">2 Antilope gnou. </note> <pb n="59"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. III.] </note> <lb/>
            one suture, in a circle; the male has three, meeting at the <lb/>
            top of the head, like a triangle ; and human skulls have been <lb/>
            seen without sutures. The head is not composed of four <lb/>
            bones, but of six ; two of these are placed above the ears, <lb/>
            and are small compared with the rest.</p>
          <p>3. From the head the jaw-bones descend. All other ani­ <lb/>
            mala move the lower jaw, the river-crocodile alone moves <lb/>
            the upper jaw. In the jaws are the order of the teeth, which <lb/>
            are bony, in some parts they are perforated, in others they <lb/>
            are not. These are the only bones too hard to be engraved.</p>
          <p>4. From the spinal-column, which is the point of union, ori­ <lb/>
            ginate the clavicles and ribs ; the breast also is placed upon <lb/>
            the ribs, and some of these are united, others are not, for <lb/>
            no animal has a bone round the stomach. There are also <lb/>
            the scapulæ upon the shoulders, and these are conti­ <lb/>
            nued upon the arms, and those again to the hands; and <lb/>
            in all animals with fore legs the nature of the bone is <lb/>
            the same.</p>
          <p>5. At the extremity of the lower part of the spinal co­ <lb/>
            lumn, and next to the hip, is the socket, and the bones <lb/>
            of the lower extremity, with those of the thigh and leg, <lb/>
            which are called the colenes. The ancles form a portion <lb/>
            of these, and the part called the spur in all creatures with <lb/>
            ancles. Continuous with these are the bones of the feet. <lb/>
            Viviparous animals with blood and feet do not differ much <lb/>
            in their bones, but rather by analogy, in hardness, softness, <lb/>
            and size. Again, some of the bones contain marrow, whilst <lb/>
            others, in the same animal, have none.</p>
          <p>6. Some animals do not appear to have any marrow at all <lb/>
            in their bones, as the lion, whose bones are very small and <lb/>
            Blight: or there may be marrow in a few of its bones, as in <lb/>
            those of the thigh and fore leg ; otherwise, in the lion, the <lb/>
            bones are particularly solid, for they are sufficiently bard to <lb/>
            emit fire like stones on concussion. The dolphin also has <lb/>
            bones, but it has no spine, like fish. Some sanguineous ani­ <lb/>
            mals differ partially from these, as the class of birds. In others, <lb/>
            as fish, the bones are only analogous, for viviparous fish have <lb/>
            a cartilaginous spine, like those which are called selachea; <lb/>
            the oviparous fish have a spine, which is like the backbone <lb/>
            of quadrupeds.</p>
          <p>7. It is a peculiarity in fish that some species have small <pb n="60"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. III.</note> <lb/>
            spines in the flesh separated from each other. Serpents arc <lb/>
            like fish, for their back-bone is spinous; among oviparous <lb/>
            quadrupeds the greater animals have a bony vertebral <lb/>
            column; the lesser have a spinous one.</p>
          <p>8. For all sanguineous animals have either a bony, or a <lb/>
            spinous column. The remainder of the bones exist in some <lb/>
            animals, but not in others, for if they have the limbs, they <lb/>
            have the bones belonging to them ; for those that have not <lb/>
            hind and fore legs have not hams, nor are they present <lb/>
            in those animals which possess limbs unlike those of quad­ <lb/>
            rupeds, for in these they vary in size and proportion. This <lb/>
            is the nature of the bones of animals.</p>

          <p>1. CARTILAGE is of the same nature as bone, but it differs <lb/>
            in the greater and less, and neither bone nor cartilage are <lb/>
            reproduced if they are cut off. In sanguineous and vivi­ <lb/>
            parous animals living on the land the cartilage is imper­ <lb/>
            forate, and does not contain marrow, like the bones; but the <lb/>
            flat selachea, which have a cartilaginous spine, have a carti­ <lb/>
            lage analogous to bone containing a liquid marrow. Vivi­ <lb/>
            parous animals, with feet, have cartilage about their ears, <lb/>
            nostrils, and extremities of their bones.</p>

          <p>1. THERE is another class of parts, which, though not the <lb/>
            same as these, are not very different, as nails, hoofs, claws, <lb/>
            and horns, and besides these, the beak of birds which alone <lb/>
            possess this part. For these are both flexible and fissile. <lb/>
            But bone is neither flexible nor fissile, but brittle; and <lb/>
            the colour of horns, nails, claws, and hoofs follow the <lb/>
            colour of the skin and the hair: for in black animals the <lb/>
            horns are black, and so are the claws and hoofs in those <lb/>
            with claws; in white animals they are white. There are <lb/>
            also intermediate colours, the nails also are of the same <lb/>
            nature.</p>
          <p>2. But the teeth are like bones; wherefore, in black men, <lb/>
            Ethiopians, and such like, the teeth and the bones are <lb/>
            white, but the nails are black, like the rest of the skin. <pb n="61"/>
            <note type="margin"> B, III.] </note> <lb/>
            The horns of most animals are hollow at their base, and <lb/>
            surround a bony process on their heads; but at the ex­ <lb/>
            tremity the horn is solid and single. The stag's horns are <lb/>
            solid throughout, and divided ; and these animals alone cast <lb/>
            their horns; this is done annually, if they are not cut <lb/>
            off. Concerning those that are cut off, we shall speak here­ <lb/>
            after.</p>
          <p>3. The horns are more nearly allied to skin than to bone, <lb/>
            so that in Phrygia and elsewhere there are oxen which <lb/>
            have the power of moving their horns, as they do their <lb/>
            ears; and of those which have nails (and all that have <lb/>
            toes have nails, and those that have feet have toes, except <lb/>
            the elephant, which has its toes undivided, and scarcely <lb/>
            distinguished, and no nails at all)—and of those with nails, <lb/>
            some have straight nails, like men, others crooked, as the <lb/>
            lion among beasts, and the eagle amongst birds.</p>

          <p>1. THIS is the nature of hair and its analogues and skin. <lb/>
            All viviparous animals, with feet, have hair; oviparous <lb/>
            animals, with feet, have scaly plates; and those fish alone <lb/>
            which produce friable ova are covered with scales; for the <lb/>
            conger and muræna among long fish have not such ova, and <lb/>
            the eel produces no ova. The hair differs in thickness, thin­ <lb/>
            ness, and size, according to its situation, both in the parts of <lb/>
            the body which it occupies, and the nature of the skin, for <lb/>
            upon thick skins the hair is generally barsh and thick, <lb/>
            the hair is both thicker and longer in the hollow and <lb/>
            moist parts of the body, if they are such as to be covered <lb/>
            with hair.</p>
          <p>2. And the case is similar in those animals which are <lb/>
            covered with plates or scales. If animals covered with soft <lb/>
            hair are placed in good pastures their hair will become <lb/>
            coarser; and, on the contrary, it becomes finer and less in <lb/>
            those that have coarse hair. Warm and cold situations also <lb/>
            make a difference, for the hair of natives of warm climates <lb/>
            is harsh, but it is soft in those of colder climates. Straight <lb/>
            hair is soft, crisped hair is harsh.</p>
          <p>3. It is the nature of hair to split; and different kinds <lb/>
            of hair are dissimilar in excess and deficiency ; some are so <lb/>
            changed by harshness as to bear slight resemblance to hair, <pb n="62"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. III.</note> <lb/>
            and are more like spines, as in the hedgehog, wherein they <lb/>
            resemble nails. So again the nails in some animals are not <lb/>
            different from bones in point of hardness.</p>
          <p>4. Man has the thinnest skin in proportion to his size. <lb/>
            There is a mucous, glutinous fluid in the skin of all animals, <lb/>
            less in some, more in others, as in the skins of oxen, from <lb/>
            which glue is made ; and sometimes glue is made from fishes. <lb/>
            When the skin alone is cut it is insensible, especially <lb/>
            that upon the head, from the absence of flesh between that <lb/>
            and the bone. Wherever the skin is without flesh it does <lb/>
            not unite again after being cut, as the thin part of the <lb/>
            cheek, the prepuce, and the eyelid. In all animals the skin <lb/>
            is continuous, and it is only wanting in places where there <lb/>
            are natural passages for exudation, and at the mouth <lb/>
            and nails. All sanguineous animals have a skin; all, <lb/>
            however, have not hair, but those which are described <lb/>
            above.</p>
          <p>5. The colour of the hair changes in men as they grow <lb/>
            old, and the hair becomes grey. This takes place in other <lb/>
            animals, but not so remarkably as in the horse. The hair <lb/>
            begins to grow white from the extremity. Most white <lb/>
            animals are white from their birth, wherefore it is plain <lb/>
            that whiteness does not arise from dryness, as some persons <lb/>
            suppose, for no animal is born dry. In the exanthematous <lb/>
            disease, called whiteness, all the hair becomes hoary; and <lb/>
            some patients, who have suffered from illness, after the hair <lb/>
            has fallen off on recovery, have regained their dark-coloured <lb/>
            hair. Hair which is covered up becomes white more <lb/>
            readily than that which is exposed to the air; in man the <lb/>
            temples are the first to grow grey, and the fore part of <lb/>
            the head before the hind part, and last of all the hair on <lb/>
            the pubes.</p>
          <p>6. Some of the hair exists on the body at the period <lb/>
            of birth, and some appears afterwards. In man alone the <lb/>
            hair on the head, eyelashes, and eyebrows exist at birth. <lb/>
            The hair on the pubes, in the armpits, and on the chin ap­ <lb/>
            pear successively after birth, so that the parts on which <lb/>
            the hair appears at birth, and those on which it grows after­ <lb/>
            wards are the same in number. In old age the hair on the <lb/>
            head especially is the first to fail, and falls off. This is <lb/>
            only in front, for no one ever becomes bald on the back <pb n="63"/>
             <note type="margin">B. III.] </note> <lb/>
            of the head. The smoothness on the crown of the head <lb/>
            is called baldness, that upon the eyebrows depilation; <lb/>
            neither of these takes place before the commencement of <lb/>
            puberty.</p>
          <p>7. Children, women, and eunuchs never become bald. If <lb/>
            a person be castrated before puberty, the hair which grows <lb/>
            after birth never makes its appearance; if after puberty <lb/>
            these alone fall off, except the hair on the pubes. Women <lb/>
            have no hair upon the chin, excepting a few of those in <lb/>
            whom the catamenia have ceased, and the priestesses in <lb/>
            Caria: and this appears ominous of future events. Women <lb/>
            also have other hair, but not much. There are some <lb/>
            persons, both male and female, who from their birth are <lb/>
            without the hair which grows after birth; but those per­ <lb/>
            sons are barren who have not hair on the pubes.</p>
          <p>8. The rest of the hair grows proportionally, either more <lb/>
            or less. That upon the head grows the most, then that on <lb/>
            the chin, and thin hair most of all. The eyebrows grow so <lb/>
            thick upon some aged persons as to be cut off, for they are <lb/>
            placed upon the symphysis of the bone; and this being <lb/>
            separated in old persons, a more abundant moisture exudes. <lb/>
            Those on the eyelids do not grow, but they fall off, <lb/>
            when persons come to puberty, and especially in those off <lb/>
            warm sexual desires; they become grey very slowly. If the <lb/>
            hair is plucked out during the period of growth, it comes <lb/>
            again, but not after it has done growing.</p>
          <p>9. Every hair has at its root a glutinous moisture, which <lb/>
            will adhere to anything with which it comes in contact, <lb/>
            soon after it is drawn out. In spotted animals the spots <lb/>
            exist both in the hair and upon the skin, and upon the skin <lb/>
            of the tongue. As for the beard, some persons have a thick <lb/>
            one, both beneath the chin and upon it; in others, these <lb/>
            parts are smooth, and the beard is on the cheeks. Those <lb/>
            who have smooth chins are least likely to become bald. The <lb/>
            hair grows in some diseases, as in phthisis especially, <lb/>
            and in old age, and upon dead bodies, and the hair becomes <lb/>
            harder instead of softer. The same is the case with the <lb/>
            nails. In persons of strong passions, the hair that is born <lb/>
            with them decreases, while that which comes after birth in­ <lb/>
            creases.</p>
          <p>10. Those who suffer from enlarged veins are less likely <pb n="64"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. III. </note> <lb/>
            to become bald ; and if they have this disease after they are <lb/>
            bald, the hair sometimes grows again. The hair, when <lb/>
            cut off, does not grow again from the extremity, but in­ <lb/>
            creases by growth from the root. The scales of fishes <lb/>
            become harder and thicker, and in those that are growing <lb/>
            thin and old they become still harder. The hair and wool <lb/>
            of old animals becomes thicker, though the quantity de­ <lb/>
            creases ; and the hoofs and claws enlarge as they grow old, <lb/>
            and the beaks of birds. And the claws grow in the same <lb/>
            way as the nails.</p>
          <p>11. Feathered animals, like birds, do not change their <lb/>
            colour by age, excepting the crane, for this bird is ash- <lb/>
            coloured, and becomes black by age. But from the change <lb/>
            of season, when it becomes cold, some of those having but <lb/>
            one colour, black or grey, become white, as the crow, <lb/>
            sparrow, and swallow ; but none of those which are white <lb/>
            become black. At different seasons of the year many birds <lb/>
            change the colour of their plumage, so as to render it difficult <lb/>
            for those who are not acquainted with them to recognise <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>12 And many animals change their colour with a change <lb/>
            of water; for in one place they are black, and in another <lb/>
            white ; and the same thing takes place at the season of co­ <lb/>
            ition. There are many waters of such a nature that if <lb/>
            sheep drink of them before sexual intercourse, they produce <lb/>
            black lambs ; as at that which is called the cold river in the <lb/>
            Thracian Chalets (in Astyritis). And in Antandria there <lb/>
            are two rivers, one of which turns the sheep white, the <lb/>
            other black ; and the Scamander appears to make the sheep <lb/>
            yellow, wherefore some people think that Homer called <lb/>
            the Scamander the Xanthus.</p>
          <p>13. Other animals have no hair internally, nor upon the <lb/>
            bottom of their feet, though it is on the upper part. The <lb/>
            hare alone has hair on the inside of its cheeks, and upon <lb/>
            its feet, and the mysticetus1 has no teeth in its mouth, <lb/>
            but hairs, like hog's bristles. The hair, if it is cut off, <lb/>
            increases below, but not above. Feathers do not grow <lb/>
            either above or below, but fall out. The wing of the bee, <lb/>
            if it is plucked off, does not grow again, nor that of any <lb/>
            other creature which has an undivided wing; nor does the <note type="footnote"> 1 Balæna Mysticetus. </note> <pb n="65"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. III.] </note> <lb/>
            sting of the bee grow after it is plucked out, but the animal <lb/>
            dies.</p>

          <p>1. THERE are membranes in all sanguineous animals. Mem­ <lb/>
            brane is like a dense thin skin, but it differs in kind, for it <lb/>
            is neither divisible nor extensible. There is a membrane <lb/>
            round every bone and every intestine, both in the greater <lb/>
            and smaller animals ; they are inconspicuous in small ani­ <lb/>
            mals, owing to their thinness and small size. The principal <lb/>
            membranes are two, which surround the brain, one round <lb/>
            the bones of the head, and this is stronger and thicker than <lb/>
            that round the brain itself; and after these, the membrane <lb/>
            which surrounds the heart. A thin membrane does not <lb/>
            unite after it has been cut asunder, and the bones, when de­ <lb/>
            prived of their membranes, become inflamed.</p>
          <p>2. The omentum is a membrane. All sanguineous ani­ <lb/>
            mals have an omentum; in some it is fat, in others it con­ <lb/>
            tains no fat. In viviparous animals, with cutting teeth in <lb/>
            both jaws, it has its origin and is suspended from the middle <lb/>
            of the stomach, where it appears like a suture of this organ. <lb/>
            In those that have not teeth in both jaws, it is suspended <lb/>
            in the same way from the principal stomach.</p>
          <p>3. The bladder also is membranous, but its character is <lb/>
            different, for it is extensible. All animals have not a <lb/>
            bladder, but all viviparous animals have this organ, and the <lb/>
            tortoise alone of oviparous animals. When the bladder is <lb/>
            cut it does not re-unite, except at the very origin of the <lb/>
            urethra, or only very rarely, for it has happened sometimes. <lb/>
            No moisture passes into the bladder of dead animals ; but <lb/>
            in living creatures there are dry compounds, from which are <lb/>
            formed the stones that are found in persons labouring under <lb/>
            this disease; sometimes they are of such a nature in the <lb/>
            bladder as to differ in nothing from shells. This, then, is <lb/>
            the nature of veins, sinews, and skins, and of muscle and <lb/>
            membrane; and of hair, nails, claws, hoofs, horns, teeth and <lb/>
            beaks, and of cartilage, bone, and their analogues.</p>

            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. IN all sanguineous animals, flesh, and that which is like <lb/>
            flesh, is between the skin and the bone, or what is analogous <note type="footnote"> <unclear>F</unclear> </note> <pb n="66"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. III. </note> <lb/>
            to bone: for the same relation which a spine bears to a bone, <lb/>
            is also borne by flesh to that which is like flesh, in animals <lb/>
            possessing bones and spines. The flesh can be divided in <lb/>
            every direction, and so is unlike sinews and veins, which <lb/>
            can only be divided in their length. The flesh disappears <lb/>
            in emaciated animals, giving place to veins and fibres. Those <lb/>
            animals which can obtain abundance of good food have fat <lb/>
            instead of flesh.</p>
          <p>2. Those that have much flesh have smaller veins and <lb/>
            redder blood, and their intestines and stomachs are small; <lb/>
            but those which have large veins and dark blood, and large <lb/>
            intestines and great stomachs, have also less flesh, for those <lb/>
            that have fat flesh have small intestines.</p>

            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XIII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. ADEPS and fat differ from each other, for fat is always <lb/>
            brittle, and coagulates upon cooling, but adeps is liquid, and <lb/>
            does not coagulate; and broths made from animals with <lb/>
            adeps do not thicken, as from the horse and hog, but that <lb/>
            made from animals with fat thickens, as from the sheep and <lb/>
            goat. These substances also differ in situation, for the <lb/>
            adeps is between the skin and the flesh ; but the fat only <lb/>
            exists upon the extremity of the flesh. In adipose animals <lb/>
            the omentum is adipose, in fat animals it is fatty: for the <lb/>
            animals with cutting teeth in both jaws are adipose, those <lb/>
            that have not cutting teeth in both jaws are fat.</p>
          <p>2. Of the viscera in some animals the liver is full of <lb/>
            adeps, as in the cartilaginous fishes, for oil is procured from <lb/>
            these during the process of decomposition, the cartilagi­ <lb/>
            nous fish are particularly free from adeps on their flesh, <lb/>
            but the adeps is separated on the stomach. The fat also <lb/>
            of fishes is adipose, and does not coagulate; and some <lb/>
            animals are furnished with adeps on the flesh, and others <lb/>
            apart from the flesh; and those creatures in which the <lb/>
            adeps is not separated from the flesh have less of this <lb/>
            substance on the stomach and omentum, as the eel: for <lb/>
            these creatures have little fat on the omentum. In most <lb/>
            animals the adeps collects principally upon the abdomen, <lb/>
            especially in those which take little exercise.</p>
          <p>3. The brain of adipose animals is unctuous, as in swine; <lb/>
            that of fatty animals is dry. Of all the viscera the kidneys <pb n="67"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. III.] </note> <lb/>
            are surrounded by the greatest quantity of adeps in all ani. <lb/>
            mals ; that on the right side is always the least adipose; <lb/>
            and let there be ever so much adeps, there is always a space <lb/>
            left between the kidneys. They are also the most fatty of <lb/>
            the viscera, and especially in sheep, for this animal some­ <lb/>
            times dies from the entire concealment of its kidneys in fat. <lb/>
            This excessive fat around the kidneys arises from good <lb/>
            pasture, as in the Leontine territory of Sicily ; wherefore <lb/>
            also in the evening they drive away the sheep which have <lb/>
            been feeding during the day, in order that they may take <lb/>
            less food.</p>
          <p>4. The fat around the pupil of the eye is common to all <lb/>
            animals ; for all have fat in this part, that possess it, and are <lb/>
            not hard-eyed. Fat animals, both male and female, are <lb/>
            more inclined to be barren, and all old animals become fat <lb/>
            more readily than young ones, especially when they increase <lb/>
            in depth, having obtained their proper width and length.</p>

            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XIV.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. THE following is the nature of the blood. This is most <lb/>
            essential and common to all sanguineous animals, and is not <lb/>
            superadded, but exists in all animals that are not in a perish­ <lb/>
            ing condition. All the blood is in a vessel called the veins, <lb/>
            but in no other part of the body, except the heart. The <lb/>
            blood of all animals has no sense of touch, nor has the excre­ <lb/>
            mentitious matter in the stomach; neither have the brain, nor <lb/>
            the marrow, any sensation of touch ; but wherever the flesh <lb/>
            is divided, the blood flows in the living subject, unless the <lb/>
            flesh is perishing. It is the nature of the blood to have a <lb/>
            sweet juice, as long as it is healthy and a red colour, and <lb/>
            that is bad which either by nature or disease is black. The <lb/>
            best kind of blood is neither very thick nor thin, unless it <lb/>
            is vitiated either by nature or disease.</p>
          <p>2. In living animals it is always warm and moist, but <lb/>
            when taken out of the animal the blood of all creatures co­ <lb/>
            agulates, except that of the stag and deer, and perhaps some <lb/>
            others of the same nature. The blood of all other creatures <lb/>
            coagulates, unless the fibre is taken out of it. Bullock's <lb/>
            blood coagulates faster than that of any other animals. <lb/>
            Amongst sanguineous animals, those which are both inter- <lb/>
            Daily and externally viviparous, have the most blood, and <note type="footnote"> <unclear>F2</unclear> </note> <pb n="68"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. III.] </note> <lb/>
            after them the oviparous sanguineous animals; those which <lb/>
            are well disposed, either by nature or by health, have not a <lb/>
            great deal of blood, as in those that have just drank; nor <lb/>
            a very little, as in those which are very fat. Fat animals <lb/>
            have pure blood, though the quantity is small; as they be­ <lb/>
            come more fat they lose a portion of their blood, for fat is <lb/>
            free from blood. Fat is not corruptible, but blood and the <lb/>
            parts that contain blood are very corruptible; of these the <lb/>
            parts surrounding the bones are most corruptible.</p>
          <p>3. Man has the thinnest and purest blood, that of the ox <lb/>
            and ass is the thickest and blackest of all viviparous ani­ <lb/>
            mals. The blood is thicker and blacker in the lower than in <lb/>
            the upper part of animals. The blood palpitates in the veins <lb/>
            alike in all animals; this alone of all the fluids exists in every <lb/>
            part of the body of living subjects, and as long only as they <lb/>
            are alive. The blood first of all exists in the heart of all <lb/>
            animals before it is distributed through the body. When de­ <lb/>
            prived of their blood, or if the greater part escapes, they faint <lb/>
            away ; but when a very great deal is lost, they die. When <lb/>
            the blood becomes very much liquefied, illness ensues, for it <lb/>
            becomes like serum, and flows through in such a manner, <lb/>
            that some have perspired blood ; and when taken out of the <lb/>
            body, it does not coagulate into a mass, but into separate <lb/>
            and divided portions.</p>
          <p>4. In sleeping animals, the blood in the extremities <lb/>
            is diminished, so that it does not flow freely when they <lb/>
            are pricked. Blood is formed from serum, and fat from <lb/>
            blood. When the blood becomes diseased, haemorrhoids <lb/>
            are produced, either in the nose or anus, and a disease <lb/>
            called ixia.1 When the blood becomes corrupted in the <lb/>
            body, pus is formed, and from pus a scab. The blood <lb/>
            in females differs from that of males, for it is more thick <lb/>
            and black in females of similar health and age. In the <lb/>
            whole of the body the quantity of blood is less in females, <lb/>
            but internally they are more full of blood. Of all females, <lb/>
            women have the most blood, and the catamenia are more <lb/>
            abundant in them than in other females.</p>
          <p>5. When this blood is diseased, it is called a flooding. <lb/>
            Women have a less share in other diseases; but a few are <lb/>
            afflicted with ixia, and with haemorrhoids and bleeding <note type="footnote">1 Varicose veins. </note> <pb n="69"/>
             <note type="margin">B. III.] </note> <lb/>
            from the nose; when any of these take place, the catamenia <lb/>
            decrease. The blood differs in proportion to the age in quan­ <lb/>
            tity and appearance, for when very young, it is more like <lb/>
            serum, and very abundant; in the aged it is thick, black, <lb/>
            and in less quantity ; in those in the prime of life it is be­ <lb/>
            tween these. In aged persons the blood coagulates quickly <lb/>
            in the body, or on the surface; but in young persons this <lb/>
            does not take place. Serum is imperfect blood, because it <lb/>
            has not ripened, or because it has become more fluid.</p>

          <p>1. CONCERNING marrow, for this is one of the fluids which <lb/>
            exist in some animals. All the natural fluids of the body <lb/>
            are contained in vessels, as the blood in the veins, and the <lb/>
            marrow in the bones, and others in membranes, skin, and <lb/>
            cavities. The marrow is always full of blood in young ani­ <lb/>
            mals ; but when they grow older, in the adipose it becomes <lb/>
            adipose, in fat animals fatty. There is not marrow in all <lb/>
            the bones, but only in those that are hollow, and not even <lb/>
            in some of these, for some of the bones of the lion have no <lb/>
            marrow, others but little; wherefore some persons say the <lb/>
            lion has no marrow at all, as was before observed. In the <lb/>
            bones of swine there is very little marrow, in some none at <lb/>
            all.</p>

          <p>1. THESE fluids are nearly always co-existent with animal <lb/>
            life; but milk and the spermatic fluid are produced after­ <lb/>
            wards. Of these the milk is always secreted in those ani­ <lb/>
            mals in which it is present. The spermatic fluid is not <lb/>
            secreted in all, but in some as in fishes are what are called <lb/>
            melts. All animals having milk have it in the mammæ. <lb/>
            All animals that are both internally and externally vivi­ <lb/>
            parous have mammae, that is, all that have hair, as man, and <lb/>
            the horse, the cetacea, as the dolphin, seal, and whale, for <lb/>
            these also have mammæ and milk.</p>
          <p>2. Those animals that are only externally viviparous, and <lb/>
            oviparous animals, have neither mammæ nor milk, as fish, <lb/>
            and birds. All milk has a watery serum, which is called <lb/>
            whey, and a substantial part called curds ; the thicker kinds <lb/>
            of milk have the most curds. The milk of animals without <pb n="70"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. III. </note> <lb/>
            cutting teeth in both jaws, coagulates, wherefore cheese is <lb/>
            made from the milk of domestic animals. The milk of those <lb/>
            with cutting teeth in both jaws does not coagulate, but re­ <lb/>
            sembles their adeps, and is thin and sweet; the milk of the <lb/>
            camel is the thinnest of all, next is that of the horse; in <lb/>
            the third place that of the ass. Cow's milk is thicker.</p>
          <p>3. Under the influence of cold, milk does not coagu­ <lb/>
            late, but becomes fluid; by heat it is coagulated, and be­ <lb/>
            comes thick. There is no milk in any animal before it <lb/>
            has conceived, or but rarely; but, as soon as it has con­ <lb/>
            ceived the milk is produced; the first and last milk are <lb/>
            useless. Sometimes milk has come in animals not with <lb/>
            young, from partaking of particular kinds of food; and even <lb/>
            in aged females it has been produced so freely when sucked, <lb/>
            as to afford nourishment for an infant. And the shepherds <lb/>
            round Æta, when the shegoats will not endure the approach <lb/>
            of the males, cut their udders violently against a thorn, so <lb/>
            as to cause pain; at first, when milked, they produce <lb/>
            bloody, and afterwards putrid milk, but at last their milk <lb/>
            is as good as that of those which have young ones.</p>
          <p>4. The males, both of man and other animals, rarely pro­ <lb/>
            duce milk; nevertheless, it is found in some cases: for in <lb/>
            Lemnos, a he-goat has given from the two nipples, which <lb/>
            are always found on the penis, so much milk, that cakes of <lb/>
            cheese were made from it. The same thing happened to <lb/>
            another he-goat, which was produced from this one; but <lb/>
            such things as these are considered ominous: for, on inquiry <lb/>
            being made of the god of Lemnos, he replied that there <lb/>
            should be an additional supply of cattle. A small quantity of <lb/>
            milk has been forced from some men after puberty; from <lb/>
            others a great quantity has been produced by suction.</p>
          <p>5. There is a fatness in milk which becomes oily when <lb/>
            it is cooked. In Sicily, and other countries, when there is <lb/>
            an abundant supply of goat's milk, they mix ewe's milk <lb/>
            with it, and it coagulates readily, not only because it con­ <lb/>
            tains abundance of curd, but also because it is of a drier <lb/>
            nature. Some animals have more milk than enough for the <lb/>
            support of their offspring, and this is useful for making <lb/>
            cheese, and for putting aside. The best is that of the sheep <lb/>
            and goats, and next, that of the cow. Mare's milk and ass'a <lb/>
            milk are combined with the Phrygian cheese. There is <pb n="71"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. III.] </note> <lb/>
            more cheese in the milk of the cow than of the goat: for <lb/>
            the shepherds say, from an amphora of goat's milk they can <lb/>
            make nineteen cakes of cheese, each worth an obolus, and <lb/>
            thirty from cow's milk. Other creatures have only enough <lb/>
            for their young, and no superabundance useful for making <lb/>
            cheese, as all those animals which have more than two mam­ <lb/>
            mæ, for none of these have a superabundance of milk, nor <lb/>
            will their milk make cheese.</p>
          <p>6. Milk is coagulated by the juice of figs, and by rennet; <lb/>
            the juice is placed upon wool, and the wool is washed in a <lb/>
            little milk ; this coagulates upon mixture. The rennet is a <lb/>
            kind of milk, which is found in the body of sucking animals. <lb/>
            This rennet is milk, containing cheese, for the milk be­ <lb/>
            comes cooked by the heat of the body. All ruminating ani­ <lb/>
            mals contain rennet, and the hare among those with cutting <lb/>
            teeth in both jaws. The older coagulum is the better, <lb/>
            for such rennet is useful in diarrhoea, and so is that of the <lb/>
            hare. The rennet of the fawn is the best.</p>
          <p>7. The greater or less quantity of milk drawn from <lb/>
            those animals which have milk, differs in the size of the <lb/>
            body, and the variety of the food. In Phasis there are very <lb/>
            small cows, each of which gives a great deal of milk; and <lb/>
            the large cows of Epirus give an amphora and half <lb/>
            of milk from each of their two mammæ; and the person <lb/>
            who milks them stands up, or only leans a little, because <lb/>
            he cannot reach them sitting down. The other animals of <lb/>
            Epirus are large except the ass, but the largest are the <lb/>
            cows and the dogs. These large cattle require more pas­ <lb/>
            ture ; but the country has a great deal so excellent, that <lb/>
            they can be changed to fit places every hour. The oxen <lb/>
            are the largest, and the sheep, called Pyrrhic; they have <lb/>
            received this name from king Pyrrhus.</p>
          <p>8. Some kinds of food check the milk, as the medic grass, <lb/>
            especially in ruminating animals. The cytisus and oro­ <lb/>
            bus have a very different effect; but the flower of the <lb/>
            cytisus is unwholesome, and causes inflammation; the orobus <lb/>
            does not agree with pregnant cattle, for it causes difficulty <lb/>
            of parturition. On the whole, those animals which are <lb/>
            able to eat the most food, as they are better adapted for <lb/>
            parturition, will also give the most milk, if they have enough <lb/>
            food. Some of the flatulent kinds of food, when given to <pb n="72"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. III. </note> <lb/>
            animals, increase the quantity of milk, as beans given freely <lb/>
            to the sheep, goat, ox, and chimœra;1 for they cause the udder <lb/>
            to be distended ; and it is a sign that there will be plenty <lb/>
            of milk when the udder is seen below before parturition.</p>
          <p>9. The milk lasts a long time in those that have it, if <lb/>
            they remain without sexual intercourse, and have proper <lb/>
            food; and in sheep it lasts longer than in any other animals, <lb/>
            for the sheep may be milked for eight months. Altogether <lb/>
            the ruminating animals produce milk in greater abundance, <lb/>
            and more fitted for making cheese. Around Torona the <lb/>
            cows fail in their milk a few days before calving, but give <lb/>
            milk all the rest of the time. In women dark-coloured <lb/>
            milk is better for the children than that which is white ; <lb/>
            and black women are better nurses than white women. The <lb/>
            most nutritious milk is that which contains the most cheese, <lb/>
            but that which contains less cheese is better for infants.</p>

          <p>1. ALL sanguineous animals eject the spermatic fluid; the <lb/>
            office it performs in generation, and how it is performed, <lb/>
            will be treated of in another place. In proportion to his <lb/>
            size man ejects more than other animals. This fluid, in ani­ <lb/>
            mals covered with hair, is glutinous, in others it is not glu­ <lb/>
            tinous ; in all it is white, so that Herodotus is mistaken <lb/>
            when he says that the Ethiopians have black semen. The <lb/>
            semen comes out white and thick if it is healthy, but after <lb/>
            ejection it becomes thin and black ; it does not thicken with <lb/>
            cold, but becomes thin and watery, both in colour and den­ <lb/>
            sity. By heat it coagulates and thickens, and when it has <lb/>
            been ejected for any time into the uterus, it comes out more <lb/>
            thick, and sometimes dry and twisted together. That which <lb/>
            is fruitful sinks in water, but the barren mixes with it. All <lb/>
            that Ctesias said about the semen of the elephant is false. <note type="footnote"> 1 Some kind of domestic goat, but not known. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Herodotus, iii. c. 97, 101. </note> <pb n="73"/>

          <p>1. WE have hitherto treated of sanguineous animals, the <lb/>
            parts possessed by all as well as those which are peculiar to <lb/>
            each class, and of their heterogeneous and homogeneous, <lb/>
            their external and internal parts. We are now about to <lb/>
            treat of ex-sanguineous animals. There are many classes <lb/>
            of these, first of all the mollusca.1 These are ex-sanguineous <lb/>
            animals, which have their fleshy parts external, and their <lb/>
            hard parts internal, like sanguineous animals, as the whole <lb/>
            tribe of cuttle-fish. Next the malacostraca, these are <lb/>
            animals which have their hard parts external, and their in­ <lb/>
            terior parts soft and fleshy; their hard parts are rather liable <lb/>
            to contusion than brittle, as the class of carabi and cancri.</p>
          <p>2. Another class is that of the testacea. These are ani­ <lb/>
            mals which have their internal parts fleshy, and their ex­ <lb/>
            ternal parts hard, brittle, and fragile, but not liable to <lb/>
            contusion. Snails and oysters are instances of this class.</p>
          <p>3. The fourth class is that of insects, which includes many <lb/>
            dissimilar forms. Insects are animals which, as their name <lb/>
            signifies, are insected either in their lower or upper part, or in <lb/>
            both; they have neither distinct flesh nor bone, but something <lb/>
            between both, for their body is equally hard internally and <lb/>
            externally. There are apterous insects, as the julus and <lb/>
            scolopendra; and winged, as the bee, cockchafer, and wasp ; <lb/>
            and in some kinds there are both winged and apterous in­ <lb/>
            sects; ants, for example, are both winged and apterous, <lb/>
            and so is the glowworin.</p>
          <p>4. These are the parts of animals of the class mollusca (ma­ <lb/>
            lacia) ; first the feet, as they are called, next to these the <lb/>
            head, continuous with them ; the third part is the abdomen, <lb/>
            which contains the viscera. Some persons, speaking incor­ <lb/>
            rectly, call this the head. The fins are placed in a circle <lb/>
            round this abdomen. It happens in many of the malacia <lb/>
            that the head is placed between the feet and the abdomen. <note type="footnote"> 1 The Cephalopoda. </note> <pb n="74"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin"> [B. IV. </note> </p>
          <p>5. All the polypi, except one kind, have eight feet, with <lb/>
            a double row of suckers. The sepia,1 teuthis,2 and teuthos3 <lb/>
            possess as a characteristic part two long proboscidiform mem­ <lb/>
            bers, which have rough suckers at their extremities, with <lb/>
            which they seize their food and bring it to their mouth ; and <lb/>
            when a storm arises they weather it out, fastening these <lb/>
            members upon a rock, like an anchor. They swim by means <lb/>
            of the fin-like members which are attached to the abdomen. <lb/>
            There are suckers upon all their feet.</p>
          <p>6. The polypus4 uses its tentacula both as feet and hands, <lb/>
            for it brings its food to its mouth with the two that are above <lb/>
            the mouth, and it uses the last of its tentacula, which is <lb/>
            the sharpest of all, in the act of coition ; this is the only <lb/>
            one which is at all white, and it is divided at the extre­ <lb/>
            mity, it is placed upon the back; and the smooth part, in <lb/>
            front of which are the acetabula, is called the back. In <lb/>
            front of the abdomen, and above the tentacula, they have a <lb/>
            hollow tube, by which they eject the sea-water which they <lb/>
            have received into the abdomen, if any enters through the <lb/>
            mouth. This part varies in position, and is sometimes on the <lb/>
            right side, sometimes on the left, and by this its ink is <lb/>
            ejected.</p>
          <p>7. It swims sideways upon the part called the head, <lb/>
            stretching out its feet; as it swims it is able to see forwards, <lb/>
            for the eyes are upwards, and the mouth is placed behind. <lb/>
            As long as it is alive the head is hard, as if it were inflated; <lb/>
            it touches and holds with its tentacula bent downwards, <lb/>
            a membrane is extended throughout, between the feet, if it <lb/>
            falls into the sand, it can no longer hold by it.</p>
          <p>8. The polypus and the above-mentioned malacia differ <lb/>
            from each other; the abdomen of the polypus is small, and <lb/>
            the feet are large; but of the others, the abdomen is large, <lb/>
            and the feet small, so that they cannot walk upon them. <lb/>
            They have also differences among each other; the teu­ <lb/>
            this is the smallest, the sepia wider; the teuthos is much <lb/>
            larger than the teuthis, for it reaches the length of five cubits: <lb/>
            Some sepiæ are two cubits long, and the tentacula of the <lb/>
            polypus are as long, and even larger in size.</p>
          <p>9. The class of the teuthos is rare, and differs in form from <note type="footnote">1 Sepia officinalis. </note><note type="footnote">2 Loligo vulgaris (Owen). </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Loligo media (Owen). </note><note type="footnote">4 Sepia octopodia. </note> <pb n="75"/>

            the teuthis, for the extremity of the teuthos is wider; and, <lb/>
            again, the fin is placed round the whole abdomen, but it is <lb/>
            wanting in the teuthis. It is a marine animal, as well as <lb/>
            the teuthis. After the feet, the head of all these animals is <lb/>
            placed in the middle of the feet, which are called tentacula; <lb/>
            one part of this is the mouth, in which are two teeth ; above <lb/>
            these are two large eyes ; between these is a small cartilage, <lb/>
            containing a small brain.</p>
          <p>10. In the mouth is a small piece of flesh, for these animals <lb/>
            have no tongue, but use this instead of a tongue. After <lb/>
            this, on the outside, the abdomen is apparent. The flesh of <lb/>
            this can be divided, not in a straight line, but in a circle. <lb/>
            All the malacia have a skin around this part. After the <lb/>
            mouth, they have a long and narrow oesophagus ; and con­ <lb/>
            tinuous with this is a large round crop, like that of a bird; <lb/>
            this contains the stomach, like a net. Its form is spiral, <lb/>
            like the helix of a whelk; from this a thin intestine turns <lb/>
            back, to the vicinity of the mouth. The intestine is thicker <lb/>
            than the stomach.</p>
          <p>11. The malacia have no viscus, except that which is <lb/>
            called the mytis,l and the ink which is upon it. The most <lb/>
            abundant and largest of all is that of the sepia; all ex­ <lb/>
            clude this ink, when alarmed, but especially the sepia ; the <lb/>
            mytis lies beneath the mouth; and through this the œso­ <lb/>
            phagus passes; and where the intestine turns back the ink <lb/>
            is beneath, and the same membrane surrounds both the ink <lb/>
            and the intestine. The same orifice serves for the emission <lb/>
            of the ink and the foeces.</p>
          <p>12. There are some appearances of hair2 in their bodies ; <lb/>
            the sepia, teuthis, and teuthos, have a hard part upon the <lb/>
            forward part of the body; the one is called septum (the <lb/>
            bone of the cuttle-fish), the other xiphus (the pen of the <lb/>
            loligo). These two are different; for that of the sepia is <lb/>
            strong and wide, partaking of the nature of spine and bone, <lb/>
            and it contains a spongy, friable substance; but the pen of the <lb/>
            teuthis is thin, and cartilaginous. In their form also they <lb/>
            correspond with the differences of the animals themselves. <note type="footnote"> 1 Köhler supposes the part called by Aristotle mytis to have been <lb/>

            The polypus has no hard internal part, but a portion of car­ <lb/>
            tilage round the head, which becomes hard as they grow old.</p>
          <p>13. The females also differ from the males, for the latter <lb/>
            have a passage beneath the oesophagus, extending from <lb/>
            the brain to the lowest part of the body. That part to <lb/>
            which it reaches is like a teat. In the female there are two <lb/>
            such organs, which are placed above. In both sexes, some <lb/>
            small red bodies are placed under these. The polypus has <lb/>
            one capsule of eggs, which is uneven on the surface ; it is <lb/>
            large; internally it is all of a white colour, and smooth. <lb/>
            The multitude of the ova is so great as to fill a vessel larger <lb/>
            than the head of the polypus.</p>
          <p>14. The sepia has two capsules, and many eggs are in <lb/>
            them, like white hailstones. The position of each of these <lb/>
            parts may be seen in anatomical diagrams. In all these <lb/>
            creatures the male differs from the female, and especially <lb/>
            in the sepia. The fore part of the abdomen of the male <lb/>
            is always darker than the back; and more rough than in <lb/>
            the female, and variegated wich stripes, and the extremity <lb/>
            of the body is more acute.</p>
          <p>15. There are many kinds of polypus ; one, which is the <lb/>
            largest of all, is very common. Those near land are larger <lb/>
            than those which are caught out at sea. There are smaller <lb/>
            kinds, which are variegated; these are not articles of food; <lb/>
            and two others, one of which is called eledone,1 differs in <lb/>
            the length of its feet, and is the only one of the malacia with <lb/>
            a single row of suckers, for all the rest have two; the other <lb/>
            is called bolitæna,2 and sometimes ozolis.</p>
          <p>16. There are two other kinds which dwell in shells, which <lb/>
            some persons call nautilus3 (and nauticus), and others call <lb/>
            it the egg of the polypus; its shell is like that of the hollow <lb/>
            pecten, and not like that which has its shells close together.4 <lb/>
            This animal generally feeds near the land ; when it is thrown <lb/>
            upon the shore by the waves, after its shell has fallen off, it <lb/>
            cannot escape, and dies upon the land. These animals are <lb/>
            small in form, like the bolitæna; and there is another,5 which <note type="footnote"/><note type="footnote">1 Eledone moschata.—Leach. (Owen.) </note><note type="footnote">2 Eledone cirrosa.—Leach. (Owen.) </note><note type="footnote">3 Argonauta argo.

            <note type="margin"> B. IV ]</note> <lb/>
            inhabits a shell like a snail. This animal never leaves its <lb/>
            shell, but remains in it, like the snail, and sometimes stretches <lb/>
            out its tentacula. Let thus much be said about the malacia.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER II.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. OF the malocostraca, there is one genus, of carabi,' and <lb/>
            another, very like it, of astaci ;2 these differ from the carabi, <lb/>
            which have no claws, and in some other respects. There <lb/>
            is a third genus, of carides,3 and a fourth, of carcini.4 There <lb/>
            are more genera of carides, and of carcini; for among the <lb/>
            carides are the cyphæ,5 the crangon,6 and a small species, for <lb/>
            these never grow large.</p>
          <p>2. The family of carcini is more various, and not so easily <lb/>
            enumerated; the largest genus is that called maia,7 the next <lb/>
            to this the pagurus,8 and the Heracleot carcini; and, again, <lb/>
            those that live in rivers. The other genera are small, and <lb/>
            have not received any name. On the Phenician coast there <lb/>
            are some that they call horsemen, because they run so fast <lb/>
            that it is difficult to catch them, and when opened, they are <lb/>
            empty, because they have no pasture. There is another <lb/>
            small genus like carcini, but in shape they resemble astaci.</p>
          <p>3. All these creatures, as I observed before, have their <lb/>
            hard and shelly coats on the outsides of their bodies in the <lb/>
            place of skin, the fleshy part is internal. Their under parts <lb/>
            resemble plates, upon which the females deposit their ova; <lb/>
            the carabi have five feet on each side, including the claws; <lb/>
            the carcini, also, have in all ten feet, including the claws, <lb/>
            which are last. Of the carides, the cypha have five on each <lb/>
            side; those near the head are sharp, and five others on each <lb/>
            side of the stomach have flat extremities; they have no <lb/>
            plates upon the under part of their body; those on the <lb/>
            upper part are like the carabi.</p>
          <p>4. The crangon is different, for it has, first of all, four <lb/>
            plates on each side, and, afterwards, three slight ones, con­ <lb/>
            tinuous with those on each side, and the greater part of the <lb/>
            remainder of its body is apodal; all the feet are directed <lb/>
            outwards to the side, like those of insects; but the claws, <lb/>
            in those that have them, all turned inwards. The carabus <note type="footnote">1 Palinurus, spiny lobster (Bell's crustacea). </note><note type="footnote">2 Lobster. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Prawns. </note><note type="footnote">4 Crabs. </note><note type="footnote">5 Shrimp. </note><note type="footnote">6 Perhaps Prawn. </note><note type="footnote"> 7 Perhaps Maia squinado. </note><note type="footnote">6 Cancer pagurus, Great crab. </note> <pb n="78"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. IV. </note> <lb/>
            also has a tail, and five fin-like appendages. The cypha, <lb/>
            among the carides, has a tail, with four fin-like appendages. <lb/>
            The crangon has fin-like processes on each side of the tail, <lb/>
            and the middle of them is spinous on both sides; but this <lb/>
            part is wide in the crangon, and sharp in the cypha. The <lb/>
            carcini alone are without a tail; the body of the carabi and <lb/>
            carides is elongated, that of the carcini is rounded.</p>
          <p>5. The male carabus is different from the female, for the <lb/>
            female has the first foot divided; in the male it is formed of <lb/>
            a single claw, and the fin-like process on the lower part is <lb/>
            large in the female, and interchanged with each other in the <lb/>
            neck ; in the male they are small and not interchanged. In <lb/>
            the male, also, the last feet are furnished with large and <lb/>
            sharp processes like spurs ; in the female these are small and <lb/>
            smooth. They all have two large and rough processes, like <lb/>
            horns, before their eyes, and two, smaller and smooth, below.</p>
          <p>6. The eyes of all these animals are hard, and capable of <lb/>
            motion, inwards, outwards, and to the side ; the same is the <lb/>
            nature of the carcini, in which they are even more move­ <lb/>
            able. In colour the astacus is all of a dull white, sprinkled <lb/>
            with black ; it has eight small feet, as far as the large ones; <lb/>
            after these the large feet are far greater and wider at the <lb/>
            extremity than in the carabus, and they are unequal in <lb/>
            size; for on the right side the broad part at the end is long <lb/>
            and smooth, on the left side the same part is thick and <lb/>
            round ; they are both divided from the extremity like a jaw, <lb/>
            with teeth above and below, only that in those on the right <lb/>
            the teeth are all small and sharp, and they are sharp at the <lb/>
            extremity of the left side; in the middle they are like molar <lb/>
            teeth; in the lower part are four close together, but in the <lb/>
            upper part three, but'not close together.</p>
          <p>7. In both claws the upper part is moved and pressed <lb/>
            down upon the lower; both are placed sideways in position, <lb/>
            as if intended by nature for seizure and pressure; above <lb/>
            these large feet are two rough ones, a little below the <lb/>
            mouth; and still lower, the branchial organs around the <lb/>
            mouth, which are rough and numerous, and these are con­ <lb/>
            tinually in motion; it bends and approximates its two <lb/>
            rough feet towards its mouth ; the feet near the mouth have <lb/>
            smooth appendages.</p>
          <p>8. It has two teeth like the carabus, above these the long <pb n="79"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. IV] </note> <lb/>
            horns, much shorter and smoother than in the carabus; four <lb/>
            others of the same form as these, but still shorter and <lb/>
            smoother; and above these are placed its eyes, which are <lb/>
            small and short, and not large like those of the carabus. <lb/>
            The part above the eyes is acute and rough, as it were a <lb/>
            forehead, and larger than in the carabus: on the whole, <lb/>
            the head is sharper and the thorax much wider than <lb/>
            in the carabus, and its whole body is more fleshy and soft: <lb/>
            of its right feet, four are divided at the extremity, and four <lb/>
            not divided.</p>
          <p>9. The part called the neck is externally divided into five <lb/>
            portions, the sixth and last division is wide and has five plates; <lb/>
            in the inside are four rough plates, upon which the females <lb/>
            deposit their ova. On the outside of each of these which <lb/>
            have been mentioned, there is a short and straight spine, <lb/>
            and the whole body, with the part called the thorax, is <lb/>
            smooth, and not rough as in the carabus. On the outside <lb/>
            of the large feet there are great spines. The female does <lb/>
            not in any way differ from the male, for whether the male <lb/>
            or female have larger claws, they are never both of them <lb/>
            equal.</p>
          <p>10. All these animals take in sea-water through their <lb/>
            mouths; the carcini also exhale a small portion of that which <lb/>
            they have taken in, and the carabi do this through the <lb/>
            branchiform appendages, for the carabi have many branchi­ <lb/>
            form appendages. All these animals have two teeth : the <lb/>
            carabi have two front teeth, and then a fleshy mouth in­ <lb/>
            stead of a tongue, from this an oesophagus continued on <lb/>
            to the stomach. And the carabi have a small oesophagus <lb/>
            before the stomach, and from this a straight intestine is <lb/>
            continued. In the caraboid animals and the carides, this <lb/>
            is continued to the tail in a straight passage, by which they <lb/>
            eject their excrements, and deposit their ova. In the carcini <lb/>
            this is in the middle of the folded part, for the place wherein <lb/>
            they deposit their ova is external in these also.</p>
          <p>11. All the females also, besides the intestines, have a <lb/>
            place for their ova, and the part called mytis1 or mecon, which <lb/>
            is greater or less, and the peculiar differences may be learned <lb/>
            by studying the individual cases. The carabi, as I have ob­ <lb/>
            served, have two large and hollow teeth, in which there in <note type="footnote">1 Perhaps the liver. </note> <pb n="80"/>
            <note type="margin">[B.IV.</note> <lb/>
            a juice resembling the mytis, and, between the teeth, a <lb/>
            piece of flesh resembling a tongue; from the mouth a short <lb/>
            oesophagus extends to a membranous stomach ; in the part <lb/>
            of this nearest the mouth are three teeth, two opposite and <lb/>
            one below.</p>
          <p>12. And from the side of the stomach there is a simple <lb/>
            intestine, which is of equal thickness throughout, reaching to <lb/>
            the anus. All these parts belong to the carabi, carides, and <lb/>
            carcini; and, besides these, the carabi have a passage sus­ <lb/>
            ended from the breast and reaching to the anus ; in the <lb/>
            female this performs the office of a uterus, in the male it <lb/>
            contains the spermatic fluid. This passage is in the cavity <lb/>
            of the flesh, so as to appear to be between portions of the <lb/>
            flesh, for the intestine is toward the curved part, but the <lb/>
            passage towards the cavity in the same way as in quadru­ <lb/>
            peds. In the male this part differs in nothing from the <lb/>
            female, for both are smooth and white, and contain an ochre­ <lb/>
            ous fluid, and in both sexes it is appended to the breast.</p>
          <p>13. The ova and spirals occupy the same position in the <lb/>
            carides. The male is distinguished from the female by <lb/>
            having in the flesh upon the breast two distinct white bodies, <lb/>
            in colour and position like the tentacula of the sepia; these <lb/>
            appendages are spiriform, like the mecon of the whelk; <lb/>
            their origin is from the acetabula, which are placed under <lb/>
            the last feet. These contain a red sanguineous flesh, which <lb/>
            is smooth to the touch, and not like flesh. From the whelk­ <lb/>
            like appendage there is another spiral fold, about as thick <lb/>
            as a thread, below which there are two sand-like bodies <lb/>
            appended to the intestine, containing a seminal fluid. <lb/>
            These are found in the male, but the female has ova of a <lb/>
            red colour ; these are joined to the abdomen, and on each <lb/>
            side of the intestine to the fleshy part of the body, enclosed <lb/>
            in a thin membrane. These are their internal and external <lb/>
            parts.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER III.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. IT happens that all the internal parts of sanguineous ani­ <lb/>
            mals have names, for all these have the internal viscera ; but <lb/>
            the same parts of exsanguineous animals have no names, but <lb/>
            both classes have in common the stomach, oesophagus, and <lb/>
            intestines. I have before spoken of the carcini, and their <pb n="81"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. IV] </note> <lb/>
            legs and feet, and how many they have, and in what direc­ <lb/>
            tion, and that, for the most part, they have the right claw <lb/>
            larger and stronger than the left; I have also mentioned <lb/>
            their eyes, and that most of them are able to see sideways. <lb/>
            The mass of their body is undivided, and so is their head, <lb/>
            and any other part.</p>
          <p>2. In some the eyes are placed immediately below the <lb/>
            upper part, and generally far apart; in some they are placed <lb/>
            in the middle, and near together, as in the Heracleot careini <lb/>
            and the maia. The mouth is placed below the eyes, and <lb/>
            contains two teeth, as in the carabus, but they are long <lb/>
            and not round, and over these there are two coverings, <lb/>
            between which are the appendages, which the carabus <lb/>
            also possesses.</p>
          <p>3. They receive water through their mouth, opening the <lb/>
            opercula, and emit it again by the upper passage of the mouth, <lb/>
            closing the opercula by which it entered; these are im­ <lb/>
            mediately beneath the eyes, and when they take in water <lb/>
            they close the mouth with both opercula, and thus eject <lb/>
            again the sea-water. Next to the teeth is a very short <lb/>
            oesophagus, so that the mouth appears joined to the sto­ <lb/>
            mach, and from this proceeds a divided stomach, from the <lb/>
            middle of which is a single thin intestine; this intestine <lb/>
            ends externally beneath the folding of the extremity, as I said <lb/>
            before. Between the opercula there is something resembling <lb/>
            the appendages to the teeth of the carabi; within the abdo­ <lb/>
            men is an ochreous chyme, and some small elongated white <lb/>
            bodies, and other red ones scattered through it. The male <lb/>
            differs from the female in length and width, and in the abdo­ <lb/>
            minal covering, for this is longer in the female, farther from <lb/>
            the body, and more thick-set with appendages, as in the female <lb/>
            carabi. The parts of the malacostraca are of this nature.</p>

          <p>1. THE testacea, as cochleæ,1 and cochli,2 and all that are <lb/>
            called ostrea, and the family of echini, are composed of <lb/>
            flesh, and this flesh is like that of the malacostraci, for it is <lb/>
            internal; but the shell is external, and they have no hard <lb/>
            internal part. But they have many differences amongst <lb/>
            themselves, both in regard to their external shells and their <note type="footnote"> 1 Land snails. </note><note type="footnote">2 Marine. </note><note type="footnote">3 Bivalves. </note> <note type="footnote"> G </note> <pb n="82"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. IV. </note> <lb/>
            internal flesh, for some of them have no flesh at all, as the <lb/>
            echinus; in others it is entirely internal and out of sight, <lb/>
            except the head, as the land snails and those called coccalia,1 <lb/>
            and in the sea the purpura2 and the ceryx,3 the cochlus, and <lb/>
            all the turbinated shells.</p>
          <p>2. Of the rest some are bivalves, others univalves. I call <lb/>
            those bivalves which are enclosed in two shells; the univalves <lb/>
            are enclosed in one shell, and the fleshy part is uncovered, <lb/>
            as the lepas.4 Some of the bivalves can open, as the <lb/>
            pectens and mya, for all these are joined on one side, and <lb/>
            separated on the other, so as to shut and open. There <lb/>
            are other bivalves which are joined on both sides, as the <lb/>
            solen ; others which are entirely enclosed in their shells, and <lb/>
            have no external naked flesh, as those which are called tethya.6</p>
          <p>3. And there is a great difference amongst the shells <lb/>
            themselves, for some are smooth, as the solen, mya, and <lb/>
            some conchae, called by some persons galaces ;6 other shells <lb/>
            are rough, as the limnostrea,7 pinnæ, some kinds of concha, <lb/>
            and the whelk; and of these some are marked with ridges, as <lb/>
            the pecten and a kind of concha, others are without ridges, as <lb/>
            the pinna and another species of concha. They also differ in <lb/>
            thickness and thinness, both in the whole shell and in certain <lb/>
            parts of the shell, as about the edges, for in some the edges <lb/>
            are thin, as the mya; others are thick-edged, as the limnostrea.</p>
          <p>4. Some of them are capable of motion, as the pecten, for <lb/>
            some persons say that the pectens can fly, for that they <lb/>
            sometimes leap out of the instrument by which they are <lb/>
            taken. Others, as the pinna, cannot move from the point <lb/>
            of attachment; all the turbinated shells can move and crawl; <lb/>
            the lepas (patella) also feeds by going from place to place. <lb/>
            It is common to all those with hard shells to have them <lb/>
            smooth in the inside.</p>
          <p>5. Both in univalves and bivalves the fleshy part is united <lb/>
            to the shell, so that it can only be separated by force; it is <lb/>
            more easily separated from the turbinated shells; it is a <lb/>
            characteristic of all these shells, that the base of the shell <lb/>
            has the helix directed from the head. All of them from their <lb/>
            birth have an operculum; all the turbinated testacea are <note type="footnote">1 Some small land snail with a conical shell. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Purpura. </note><note type="footnote">3 Whelk. </note><note type="footnote">4 Patella, limpet. </note><note type="footnote"> 5 Ascidians. </note><note type="footnote">6 Chama, L. </note><note type="footnote">7 Ostrea edulii. </note> <pb n="83"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. IV.] </note> <lb/>
            right-handed, and move, not in the direction of the helix, <lb/>
            but the contrary way.</p>
          <p>6. The external parts of these creatures are thus distin­ <lb/>
            guished ; the nature of their internal structure is similar <lb/>
            in all, especially in the turbinated animals, for they differ <lb/>
            in size and in the relations of excess, the univalves and <lb/>
            bivalves do not exhibit many differences. Most of them <lb/>
            have but few distinctive marks from each other, but they <lb/>
            differ more from the immovable creatures. This will be <lb/>
            more evident from the following considerations. In na­ <lb/>
            ture they are all alike, the difference, as before said, is in <lb/>
            excess ; for in larger species the parts are more conspicuous, <lb/>
            and less so in those that are smaller. They differ also in <lb/>
            hardness and softness, and such like affections.</p>
          <p>7. For all have on the outside of the shell, in the mouth, <lb/>
            a hard piece of flesh, some more, some less; from the middle <lb/>
            of this are the head and the two horns ; these are large in <lb/>
            larger species, in the little ones they are very small. The <lb/>
            head is protruded in the same manner in all of them, and <lb/>
            when the creature is alarmed it is again retracted; some <lb/>
            have a mouth and teeth, as the snail, which has small, sharp, <lb/>
            and smooth teeth.</p>
          <p>8. They have also a proboscis, like that of the By, and this <lb/>
            organ is like a tongue. In the ceryx and the purpura this <lb/>
            organ is hard, like that of the my ops and oestrus, with which <lb/>
            they pierce through the skins of quadrupeds ; but this is <lb/>
            more powerful in strength, for they can pierce through the <lb/>
            shells of the baits. The stomach is joined quite closely to <lb/>
            the mouth ; the stomach of the cochlus is like the crop of a <lb/>
            bird; below this there are two hard white substances like <lb/>
            nipples, which also exist in the sepia, but are much harder.</p>
          <p>9. From the stomach a long, simple intestine reaches as far <lb/>
            as the spiral, which is on the extremity of the body. These <lb/>
            are distinct, and in the purpura and the ceryx are in the <lb/>
            helix of the shell. The bowel is continuous with the intes­ <lb/>
            tine. The intestine and bowels are joined together, and are <lb/>
            quite simple, to the anus. The origin of the bowel is around <lb/>
            the helix of the mecon,1 and here it is wider. The mecon is, <lb/>
            as it were, a superfluous part in all testacea, afterwards an­ <lb/>
            other bend causes it to return to the fleshy part; the end of <note type="footnote"> I The so-called liver (Strack). Papaver (Scaliger). </note> <note type="footnote"> G 2 </note> <pb n="84"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. IV.</note> <lb/>
            the entrail, where the faeces are emitted, is near the head, and <lb/>
            is alike in all turbinated shells, whether terrestrial or marine.</p>
          <p>10. In the larger cochli a long white passage, contained <lb/>
            in a membrane, and in colour resembling the upper mastoid <lb/>
            appendages, is joined from the stomach to the oesophagus, <lb/>
            and it is divided into segments like the ovum of the carabus, <lb/>
            except that it is white, while the other is red. It has <lb/>
            neither exit nor passage, but it is contained in a thin mem­ <lb/>
            brane, which has a narrow cavity. From the intestine <lb/>
            black and rough bodies descend continuously, like those in <lb/>
            the tortoise, but they are less black.</p>
          <p>11. Both these and white bodies occur in the marine cochli, <lb/>
            but they are less in the smaller kinds. The univalves and <lb/>
            bivalves are in some respects like these, and in others they <lb/>
            are different, for they have a head, horns, and mouth, and <lb/>
            something like a tongue, though in smaller species these <lb/>
            are inconspicuous from their minute size, and they are not <lb/>
            discernible when the animals are dead or at rest. They all <lb/>
            contain the mecon, but not in the same position, nor of the <lb/>
            same size, nor equally conspicuous. In the lepas it is in the <lb/>
            bottom of the shell, in the bivalves near the hinge.</p>
          <p>12. They all have hair-like appendages placed in a circle, <lb/>
            and so have the pectens, and that which is called the ovarium <lb/>
            in those that have it; where it is possessed, it is placed in a <lb/>
            circle on the other side of the circumference, like the white <lb/>
            portion in the cochli, for this is alike in all. All these parts, <lb/>
            as I have said, are conspicuous in the larger kinds, but in <lb/>
            smaller not at all, or scarcely so, wherefore they are most <lb/>
            conspicuous in the larger pectens, and these have one valve <lb/>
            flat like an operculum.</p>
          <p>13. The anus is placed in the side in some of these crea­ <lb/>
            tures, for this is where the excrement passes out. The mecon, <lb/>
            as I have said, is a superfluous part enclosed in a thin mem­ <lb/>
            brane in all of them; that which is called the ovarium has no <lb/>
            passage in any of them, but it swells out in the flesh. This is <lb/>
            not placed upon the intestine, for the ovarium is on the right <lb/>
            side and the intestine on the left; the anus is the same as in <lb/>
            others; but in the wild patella, as some persons call it, or the <lb/>
            sea-ear (haliotis), as it is named by others, the excrement <lb/>
            passes out below the shell, for the shell is perforated. The <lb/>
            stomach also is distinct behind the mouth, and so is the ova- <pb n="85"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. IV] </note> <lb/>
            rium in this animal. The position of all these parts may be <lb/>
            seen in dissections.</p>
          <p>14. The creature called carcinium1 resembles both the <lb/>
            malacostraca and the testacea, for this in its nature is similar <lb/>
            to the animals that are like carabi, and it is born naked <lb/>
            (not covered with a shell). But because it makes its way <lb/>
            into a shell, and lives in it, it resembles the testacea, and <lb/>
            for these reasons it partakes of the character of both classes. <lb/>
            Its shape, to speak plainly, is that of a spider, except that <lb/>
            the lower part of the head and thorax is larger.</p>
          <p>15. It has two thin red horns, and two large eyes below <lb/>
            these, not within nor turned on one side, like those of the <lb/>
            crab, but straight forwards. Below these is the mouth, <lb/>
            and round it many hair-like appendages ; next to these, two <lb/>
            divided feet with which it seizes its prey, and two besides <lb/>
            these on each side, and a third pair smaller. Below the <lb/>
            thorax the whole creature is soft, and when laid open is <lb/>
            yellow within.</p>
          <p>16. From the mouth is a passage as far as the stomach ; <lb/>
            but the anus is indistinct; the feet and the thorax are hard, <lb/>
            but less so than those of the cancri ; it is not united with the <lb/>
            shell like the purpura and ceryx, but is easily liberated from <lb/>
            it. The individuals which inhabit the shells of the strombus <lb/>
            are longer than those in the shells of the nerita.</p>
          <p>17. The kind which inhabits the nerita is different, though <lb/>
            very like in other respects, for the right divided foot is small, <lb/>
            and the left one large, and it walks more upon this than the <lb/>
            other; and a similar animal is found in the conchae, though <lb/>
            they are united to their shells very firmly; this animal is called <lb/>
            cyllarus.2 The nerita has a smooth, large, round shell, in <lb/>
            form resembling that of the ceryx, but the mecon is not <lb/>
            black, but red; it is strongly united in the middle.</p>
          <p>18. In fine weather they seek their food at liberty, and if a <lb/>
            storm arises, the carcinia hide themselves under a stone, and <lb/>
            the neritæ attach themselves to it like the patella, the <lb/>
            hæmorrhois, and all that class, for they become attached <lb/>
            to the rock, where they close their operculum, for this re­ <lb/>
            sembles a lid; for that part which is in both sides in the <lb/>
            bivalves is joined to one side in the turbinated shells: the <lb/>
            interior is fleshy, and in this the mouth is placed. <note type="footnote"> 1 Hermit crab. </note><note type="footnote">2 Cancer Diogenes. </note> <pb n="86"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin"> [B. IV.</note> 19. The nature of the hæmorrhois, the purpura, and all <lb/>
            such animals is the same. But those which have the left <lb/>
            foot greater are not found in the shells of the strombus, but <lb/>
            in the neritæ. There are some cochli which contain an ani­ <lb/>
            mal like the small astacus, which is found in rivers; but <lb/>
            they differ from them in having the inner part of the shell <lb/>
            soft. Their form may be seen by examining dissections.</p>

          <p>1. THE echini contain no flesh, but this part is peculiar, for <lb/>
            they are all of them void of flesh, and are filled with a black <lb/>
            substance. There are many kinds of echinus, one of which <lb/>
            is eatable; in this one the ova are large and eatable, both in <lb/>
            the greater and the less.</p>
          <p>2. And there are two other kinds, the spatangus and that <lb/>
            called bryttus; these are inhabitants of the sea, and rare. <lb/>
            Those which are called echinometræ1 are the largest of all. <lb/>
            Besides this, there is another small species, which has long <lb/>
            and sharp spines; this is procured from the sea, in many <lb/>
            fathoms water, and some persons use it for stranguary.</p>
          <p>3. Around Torona there are white marine echini, which <lb/>
            have shells, and prickles, and ova, and are longer than others; <lb/>
            but the prickle is neither large nor strong, but soft, and the <lb/>
            black parts from the mouth are more in number, and united <lb/>
            to the outward passage, but distinct among themselves, and <lb/>
            by these the animal is as it were divided. The eatable kinds <lb/>
            are particularly and especially active, and it is a sign of them; <lb/>
            for they have always something adhering to their spines.</p>
          <p>4. They all contain ova, but in some they are very small, <lb/>
            and not eatable: that which is called the head and mouth in <lb/>
            the echinus is downwards, and the anus placed upwards. <lb/>
            The same thing occurs in the turbinated shells, and the <lb/>
            patella; for their food is placed below them, so that the mouth <lb/>
            is towards the food, and the anus at or on the upper part of <lb/>
            the shell.</p>
          <p>5. The echinus has five hollow internal teeth, in the midst <lb/>
            of these a portion of flesh like a tongue ; next to this is the <lb/>
            oesophagus; then the stomach, in five divisions, full of fæcu­ <lb/>
            lent matter: all its cavities unite in one, near the anus, <lb/>
            where the shell is perforated. Beneath the stomach, in an. <note type="footnote"> 1 Echinus esculentus. </note> <pb n="87"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. IV.] </note> <lb/>
            other membrane, are the ova, the same number in all, they <lb/>
            are five in number, and uneven.</p>
          <p>6. The black substance is joined above to the origin of the <lb/>
            teeth, this black substance is bitter and not eatable ; in many <lb/>
            animals there is either this substance or its analogue, for it is <lb/>
            found in tortoises, toads, frogs, turbinated shells, and in the <lb/>
            malacia; these parts differ in colour, but are entirely or nearly <lb/>
            uneatable. The body of the echinus is undivided from be­ <lb/>
            ginning to end, but the shell is not so when seen through, <lb/>
            for it is like a lantern, with no skin around it. The echinus <lb/>
            uses its spines as feet, for it moves along by leaning upon <lb/>
            them and moving them.</p>

          <p>1. THE creatures called tethya1 have a most distinct charac­ <lb/>
            ter, for in these alone is the whole body concealed in a <lb/>
            shell. Their shell is intermediate between skin and shell, <lb/>
            so that it can be cut like hard leather: this shell-like sub­ <lb/>
            stance is attached to rocks; in it there are two perforations, <lb/>
            quite distant from each other, and not easily seen, by which <lb/>
            it excludes and receives water, for it has no visible excre­ <lb/>
            ment as other testacea, neither like the echinus, nor the <lb/>
            substance called mecon.</p>
          <p>2. When laid open, there is first of all a sinewy membrane <lb/>
            lining the shell-like substance, within this the fleshy sub­ <lb/>
            stance of the tethyon. Unlike any other creature, its flesh, <lb/>
            however, is alike throughout, and it is united in two places <lb/>
            to the membrane and the skin from the side, and at its <lb/>
            points of union it is narrower on each side ; by these places <lb/>
            it reaches to the external perforations which pass through <lb/>
            the shell; there it both parts with and receives food and <lb/>
            moisture, as if one were the mouth, the other the anus, the <lb/>
            one is thick, the other thinner.</p>
          <p>3. Internally there is a cavity at each end, and a passage <lb/>
            passes through it; there is a fluid in both the cavities. Be­ <lb/>
            sides this, it has no sensitive or organic member, nor is there <lb/>
            any excrementitious matter, as I said before. The colour of <lb/>
            the tethyon is partly ochreous, partly red.</p>
          <p>4. The class acalephe2 is peculiar; it adheres to rocks like <lb/>
            some of the testacea, but at times it is washed off. It is not <note type="footnote">1 Ascidian mollusks. </note><note type="footnote">2 Actiniæ. </note> <pb n="88"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. IV.</note> <lb/>
            covered with a shell, but its whole body is fleshy; it is sen­ <lb/>
            sitive, and seizes upon the hand that touches it, and it holds <lb/>
            fast, like the polypus does with its tentacula, so as to make <lb/>
            the flesh swell up. It has a central mouth, and lives upon <lb/>
            the rock, as well as upon shell-fish, and if any small fish falls <lb/>
            in its way, it lays hold of it as with a hand, and if any eat­ <lb/>
            able thing falls in its way it devours it.</p>
          <p>5. One species is free, and feeds upon anything it meets <lb/>
            with, even pectens and echini; it appears to have no visible <lb/>
            excrement, and in this respect it resembles plants. There <lb/>
            are two kinds of acalephe, some small and more eatable, <lb/>
            others large and hard, such as are found near Chalets. Dur­ <lb/>
            ing winter their flesh is compact, wherefore in this season <lb/>
            they are caught and eaten; in summer time they perish, for <lb/>
            they become soft; if they are touched they soon melt down, <lb/>
            and cannot by any means be taken away. When suffering <lb/>
            from heat, they prefer getting under stones. I have now <lb/>
            treated of malacia, malacostraca, testacea, and of their exter­ <lb/>
            nal and internal parts.</p>

          <p>1. INSECTS must now be treated of in the same manner. <lb/>
            This is a class which contains many forms, and no common <lb/>
            name has been given to unite those that are naturally <lb/>
            related, as the bee, anthrene,1 and wasp, and such like; <lb/>
            again, those which have their wings enclosed in a case, as <lb/>
            the melolontha,2 carabus,3 cantharis, and such like. The <lb/>
            common parts of all insects are three-the head, the abdo­ <lb/>
            men, and the third, which is between these, such as in other <lb/>
            animals is the breast and back. In many insects this is one, <lb/>
            but in the long insects with many legs, the middle parts are <lb/>
            equal to the number of segments.</p>
          <p>2. All insects survive being divided, except those which <lb/>
            are naturally cold, or soon become so from their small size, <lb/>
            so that wasps live after they are cut asunder; either the <lb/>
            bead or the abdomen will live if united to the thorax, but <lb/>
            the head will not live alone. Those which are long, and <lb/>
            have many feet, will survive division for a considerable time; <lb/>
            both the extremities are capable of motion, for they walk <lb/>
            both upon the part cut off and upon the tail, as that which is <lb/>
            called scolopendra. All of them have eyes, but no other <note type="footnote">1 Wild bee. </note><note type="footnote">2 Chafer. </note><note type="footnote">2 Beetle. </note> <pb n="89"/>
            <note type="margin">B. IV.]</note> <lb/>
            manifest organs of sense, except that some have a tongue. <lb/>
            All the testacea have this organ, which serves the double <lb/>
            purpose of tasting and drawing food into the mouth.</p>
          <p>3. In some of them this organ is soft; in others very <lb/>
            strong, as in the purpura; in the my ops and oestrus this <lb/>
            member is strong, and in a great many more; for this mem­ <lb/>
            ber is used as a weapon by all those that have no caudal <lb/>
            sting.</p>
          <p>4. Those with this weapon have no small external teeth, <lb/>
            for flies draw blood by touching with this organ, and gnats <lb/>
            sting with it. Some insects also have stings, which are <lb/>
            either internal, as in bees and wasps, or external, as in the <lb/>
            scorpion. This last is the only insect that has a long tail; <lb/>
            it has claws, and so has the little scorpion-like creature1 <lb/>
            found in books. The winged insects, in addition to other <lb/>
            parts, have wings. Some have two wings, as the flies; <lb/>
            others four, as the bees; none of the diptera have a caudal <lb/>
            sting. Some of the winged insects have elytra on their <lb/>
            wings, as the melolontha; and others no elytra, as the bee. <lb/>
            Insects do not direct their flight with their tail, and their <lb/>
            wings have neither shaft nor division.</p>
          <p>5. Some have a horn before their eyes, as the psychæ2 and <lb/>
            carabi. Of the jumping insects, some have their hind-legs <lb/>
            larger; others have the organs of jumping bent backwards, <lb/>
            like the legs of quadrupeds. In all, the upper part is dif­ <lb/>
            ferent from the lower, like other animals.</p>
          <p>6. The flesh of their bodies is neither testaceous nor <lb/>
            like the internal parts of testacea, but between the two. <lb/>
            Wherefore, also, they have neither spine nor bone, as the <lb/>
            sepia ; nor are they surrounded with a shell. For the body <lb/>
            is its own protection by its hardness, and requires no other <lb/>
            support; and they have a very thin skin. This is the <lb/>
            nature of their external parts.</p>
          <p>7. Internally, immediately after the mouth, there is an <lb/>
            intestine which in most insects passes straight and simply <lb/>
            to the anus, in a few it is convoluted; these have no bones <lb/>
            nor fat, neither has any other exsanguineous animal. Some <lb/>
            have a stomach, and from this the remainder of the intes­ <lb/>
            tine is either simple or convoluted, as in the aerial The <note type="footnote">1 Phalangium Cancroides. Linn. Schneider. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Butterfly. </note><note type="footnote">a Locust. </note> <pb n="90"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. IV.</note> <lb/>
            tettix (grasshopper) alone of this, or any other class of <lb/>
            living creatures, has no mouth ; but, like those with a caudal <lb/>
            sting, it has the appearance of a tongue, long, continuous, <lb/>
            and undivided, and with this it feeds upon the dew alone. <lb/>
            There is no excrement in the stomach. There are many <lb/>
            kinds of these creatures, they differ in being greater or less ; <lb/>
            those called achetae are divided beneath the diaphragm, and <lb/>
            have a conspicuous membrane, which the tettigonia has not.</p>
          <p>8. There are many other creatures in the sea which it is <lb/>
            not possible to arrange in any class from their scarcity. <lb/>
            For some experienced fishermen say they have seen in the sea <lb/>
            creatures like small beams, black and round, and of the same <lb/>
            thickness throughout; others like shields, of a red colour, <lb/>
            with many fins ; others1 like the human penis in appearance <lb/>
            and size, but instead of testicles they had two fins, and that <lb/>
            such have been taken on the extremity of grappling irons. <lb/>
            This is the nature of the internal and external parts of all <lb/>
            animals of every kind, both those which are peculiar to cer­ <lb/>
            tain species, and those which are common to all.</p>

            <title type="sub">CHAPTER VIII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. WE must now treat of the Senses: for they are not alike <lb/>
            in all, but some have all the senses, and some fewer. They <lb/>
            are mostly five in number; seeing, hearing, smelling, <lb/>
            taste, touch, and besides these there are none peculiar to <lb/>
            any creatures. Man, then, and all viviparous animals with <lb/>
            feet, besides all sanguineous and viviparous animals, have all <lb/>
            these, unless they are undeveloped in any particular kind, <lb/>
            as in the mole.</p>
          <p>2. For this creature has no sight, it has no apparent eyes, <lb/>
            but when the thick skin which surrounds the head is taken <lb/>
            away, in the place where the eyes ought to be on the out­ <lb/>
            side, are the undeveloped internal eyes, which have all the <lb/>
            parts of true eyes, for they have both the iris of the eye, <lb/>
            and within the iris the part called the pupil, and the <lb/>
            white; but all these are less than in true eyes. On the <lb/>
            outside there is no appearance of these parts, from the <lb/>
            thickness of the skin, as if the nature of the eye had been <lb/>
            destroyed at birth; for there are two sinewy and strong <lb/>
            passages proceeding from the brain, where it unites with <note type="footnote">1 Perhaps P 3nnatula. </note> <pb n="91"/>
            <note type="margin">B. IV.]</note> <lb/>
            the spinal cord, reaching from the socket of the eye, and <lb/>
            ending upon the upper sharp teeth.</p>
          <p>3. All other animals are endued with the perception of <lb/>
            colours, sounds, smells, and taste. All animals have the <lb/>
            fifth sense, which is called touch. In some animals the <lb/>
            organs of sense are very distinct, and especially the eyes, <lb/>
            for they have a definite place, and so has the hearing. For <lb/>
            some animals have ears, and others open perforations: so <lb/>
            also of the sense of smelling, some animals have nostrils, <lb/>
            others passages, as the whole class of birds. In the same <lb/>
            way the tongue is the organ of taste.</p>
          <p>4. In aquatic animals and those called fish, the tongue is <lb/>
            still the organ of taste, though it is indistinct, for it is <lb/>
            bony, and not capable of free motion. In some fish the <lb/>
            roof of the mouth is fleshy, as in some cyprini among river <lb/>
            fish, so that, without careful examination, it appears like a <lb/>
            tongue. That they have the sense of taste is quite clear, <lb/>
            for many of them delight in peculiar food, and they will <lb/>
            more readily seize upon a bait formed of the amia and other <lb/>
            fat fishes, as if they delighted in the taste and eating of <lb/>
            such baits.</p>
          <p>5. They have no evident organ of hearing and smelling, <lb/>
            for the passages which exist about the region of the nostrils <lb/>
            in some fish do not appear to pass to the brain, but some of <lb/>
            them are blind, and others lead to the gills; it is evident, <lb/>
            however, that they both hear and smell, for they escape from <lb/>
            loud noises, such as the oars of the triremes, so as to be <lb/>
            easily captured in their hiding-places.</p>
          <p>6. For if the external noise is not loud, yet to all aquatic <lb/>
            animals that are capable of hearing, it appears harsh and very <lb/>
            loud; and this takes place in hunting dolphins, for when they <lb/>
            have enclosed them with their canoes, they make a noise from <lb/>
            them in the sea, and the dolphins, crowded together, are <lb/>
            obliged to leap upon the land, and, being stunned with the <lb/>
            noise, are easily captured, although even dolphins have no <lb/>
            external organs of hearing.</p>
          <p>7. And again in fishing, the fishermen are careful to <lb/>
            avoid making a noise with their oars or net when they per­ <lb/>
            ceive many fish collected in one place; they make a signal, <lb/>
            and let down their nets in such a place that no sound of the <lb/>
            oar or the motion of the waters should reach the place <pb n="92"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. IV. </note> <lb/>
            where the fish are collected, and the sailors are commanded <lb/>
            to row in the greatest silence until they have enclosed them.</p>
          <p>8. Sometimes, when they wish to drive them together, <lb/>
            they proceed as in dolphin catching, for they make a noise <lb/>
            with stones that they may be alarmed and collected together, <lb/>
            and thus they are enclosed in a net. Before their inclosure, <lb/>
            as it was said, they prevent a noise, but as soon as they have <lb/>
            enclosed them, they direct the sailors to shout and make a <lb/>
            noise, for they fall down with fear when they hear the noise <lb/>
            and tumult.</p>
          <p>9. And when the fishers observe large shoals at a dis­ <lb/>
            tance, collected on the surface in calm, fine weather, and <lb/>
            wish to know their size, and of what kind they are, if they <lb/>
            can approach them in silence, they avoid their notice, and <lb/>
            catch them while they are on the surface. If any noise is <lb/>
            made before they reach them, they may be seen in flight. <lb/>
            In the rivers, also, there are little fish under the stones, <lb/>
            which some persons call cotti :1 from their dwelling beneath <lb/>
            rocks, they catch them by striking the rocks with stones, <lb/>
            and the fishes fall down frightened when they hear the <lb/>
            noise, being stunned by it. It is evident, from these con­ <lb/>
            siderations, that fishes have the sense of hearing.</p>
          <p>10. There are persons who say that fish have more acute <lb/>
            ears than other animals, and that, from dwelling near the <lb/>
            sea, they have often remarked it. Those fish which have the <lb/>
            most acute ears are the cestreus2 (chremps),3 labrax,4 salpe,5 <lb/>
            chromis,6 and all such fishes ; in others the sense of hearing <lb/>
            less acute, because they live in the deeper parts of the <lb/>
            ocean.</p>
          <p>11. Their nature of smelling is the same, for the greater <lb/>
            number of fishes will not take a bait that is not quite fresh ; <lb/>
            others are less particular. All fish will not take the same <lb/>
            bait, but only particular baits, which they distinguish by the <lb/>
            smell; for some are taken with stinking baits, as the salpe <lb/>
            with dung. Many fish also live in the holes of rocks, and <lb/>
            when the fishermen want to entice them out, they anoint <lb/>
            the mouths of these holes with salted scents, to which they <lb/>
            readily come. <note type="footnote"> 1 Perhaps Cottus gobio L., miller's thumb. Salmo Fario (Strack). </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Mullet. </note><note type="footnote">3 Unknown. </note><note type="footnote">4 Perea Labrax. </note><note type="footnote"> 5 Scomber. </note><note type="footnote">6 Unknown. </note> <pb n="93"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin"> B. IV.] </note> 12. The eel also is enticed out in this way, for they place <lb/>
            a pitcher of salt food, covering the mouth of the pitcher <lb/>
            with another vessel pierced with holes, and the eels are <lb/>
            quickly drawn forth by the smell of the bait. Baits made <lb/>
            of the roasted flesh of the cuttle fish, on account of its <lb/>
            strong smell, attract fish very readily. They say they put <lb/>
            the roasted flesh of the polypus upon their hooks for nothing <lb/>
            but its strong smell.</p>
          <p>13. ADd the fish called rhyades,' when the washings of <lb/>
            fish or of foetid drains are emptied into the water, make <lb/>
            their escape as if smelling the foetid odour. They say that <lb/>
            fish soon smell the blood of their own kind; this is plain <lb/>
            from their hastening from any place where the blood of <lb/>
            fishes may be. On the whole, if any one use a putrid bait, <lb/>
            the fish will not come near it; but if a fresh strong-smelling <lb/>
            bait is used, they will come to it from a great distance.</p>
          <p>14. This is especially observable in what was said of <lb/>
            dolphins, for these creatures have not external organs of <lb/>
            hearing, but are captured by being stunned with a noise, as <lb/>
            was before observed; neither have they any external organs <lb/>
            of smell, yet their scent is acute. Therefore, it is evident <lb/>
            that all creatures have these senses. Other kinds of animals <lb/>
            are divided into four classes; and these contain the mul­ <lb/>
            titude of remaining animals, namely, the malacia, malaco­ <lb/>
            straca, testacea, and insects.</p>
          <p>15. Of these the malacia, the malacostraca, and insects have <lb/>
            all the senses, for they can see, smell, and taste. Insects, whe­ <lb/>
            ther they have wings or are apterus, can smell from a great <lb/>
            distance, as the bee and the cnips 2 scent honey, for they <lb/>
            perceive it from a long distance, as if they discovered it by <lb/>
            the scent. Many of them perish by the fumes of sulphur: <lb/>
            ants leave their hills when origanum and sulphur are <lb/>
            sprinkled upon them. Almost all of them escape from the <lb/>
            fumes of burnt stags' horns, but most of all do they avoid <lb/>
            the smell. of burnt styrax.</p>
          <p>16. The sepia, also, the polypus, and the carabus are <lb/>
            caught with baits; the polypus holds the bait so fast that <lb/>
            it holds on even when cut: if a person hold conyza to them, <lb/>
            they let go as soon as they smell it. So, also, of the sense <lb/>
            of taste, for they follow different kinds of food, and do not <note type="footnote">1 A fish living in shoals. </note><note type="footnote">2 Perhaps some species of ant, </note> <pb n="94"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. IV. </note> <lb/>
            all prefer the same food, as the bee approaches nothing that <lb/>
            is putrid, only sweet things; the gnat not what is sweet, <lb/>
            but what is acid.</p>
          <p>17. As I before observed, the sense of touch belongs to <lb/>
            all animals. The testacea have the senses of smelling and <lb/>
            tasting. This is plain from the baits used, as those for the <lb/>
            purpuræ ; for this creature is caught with putrid substances, <lb/>
            and will be attracted from a great distance to such baits, <lb/>
            as if by the sense of smell. It is evident from what follows <lb/>
            that they possess the sense of taste; for whatever they <lb/>
            select by smell, they all love to taste.</p>
          <p>18. And all animals with mouths receive pain or <lb/>
            pleasure from the contact of food. But, concerning the <lb/>
            senses of sight and hearing, it is not possible to say anything <lb/>
            certain, or very distinct; the solens, if a person touch them, <lb/>
            appear to retract themselves, and try to escape when they <lb/>
            see an instrument approaching them, for a small portion of <lb/>
            them is beyond the shell, the remainder as it were in a retreat; <lb/>
            the pectens. also, if a finger is brought near them, open and <lb/>
            shut themselves as if they could see.</p>
          <p>19. Those who seek for neritæ do not approach them with <lb/>
            the wind, when they seek them for baits, nor do they speak, <lb/>
            but come silently, as if the creatures could both smell and <lb/>
            hear; they say that if they speak, they get away. Of all testacea, <lb/>
            the echinus appears to have the best sense of smell amongst <lb/>
            those that can move, and the tethya and balanus in those <lb/>
            that are fixed. This is the nature of the organs of sense in <lb/>
            all animals.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER IX.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. THE following is the nature of the voice of animals, <lb/>
            for there is a distinction between voice and sound. Speech, <lb/>
            again, is different from these. Voice is due to no other part <lb/>
            except the pharynx, the creatures, therefore, without <lb/>
            lungs are also without voice. Speech is the direction of the <lb/>
            voice by the tongue; the vowels are uttered by the voice <lb/>
            and the larynx, the mutes by the tongue and the lips; speech <lb/>
            is made up of these: wherefore, no animals can speak that <lb/>
            have not a tongue, nor if their tongue is confined.</p>
          <p>2. The power of uttering a sound is connected with other <lb/>
            parts also; insects have neither voice nor speech, but make <pb n="95"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. IV.] </note> <lb/>
            a sound with the air within them, not with that which is <lb/>
            external, for some of them breathe not, some of them buzz, <lb/>
            as the bee with its wings, and others are said to sing, as the <lb/>
            grasshopper. All these make a noise with the membrane <lb/>
            which is beneath the division of their body in those which <lb/>
            have a division, as some families of grasshoppers by the <lb/>
            friction of the air. These insects, bees, and all other insects <lb/>
            raise and depress their wings in flight, for the sound is the <lb/>
            friction of the air within them. Locusts produce a sound <lb/>
            by rubbing themselves with their legs, which are adapted <lb/>
            for leaping. None of the malacia utter any sound or natural <lb/>
            voice, nor do the malacostraca.</p>
          <p>3. Fish also are mute, for they have neither lunge, <lb/>
            trachea, nor pharynx. Some of them utter a sound and a <lb/>
            squeak; these are said to have a voice, as the lyral and chromic <lb/>
            for these utter, as it were, a grunt; so does the capros, a fish <lb/>
            of the Achelous, the chalceus3 and coccyx,4 for the one <lb/>
            utters a sound like hissing, the other a noise like that of <lb/>
            the cuckoo, from whence also its name is derived. Some of <lb/>
            these utter their apparent voice by the friction of their <lb/>
            gills, for these places are spinous, in others the sound is <lb/>
            internal, near the stomach. For each of them has an organ <lb/>
            of breathing, which causes a sound when it is pressed and <lb/>
            moved about.</p>
          <p>4. Some of the selachea also appear to whistle, but they <lb/>
            cannot be correctly said to utter a voice, only to make a <lb/>
            sound. The pectens also make a whizzing noise when they <lb/>
            are borne upon the surface of the water, or flying, as it is <lb/>
            called; and so do the sea-swallows,5 for they also fly through <lb/>
            the air in the same way, not touching the sea, for they have <lb/>
            wide and long fins. As the sound made by birds flying <lb/>
            through the air is not a voice, so neither can either of these <lb/>
            be properly so called. The dolphin also utters a whistle <lb/>
            and lows when it comes out of the water into the air, in a <lb/>
            different way from the animals above-mentioned-for this <lb/>
            is a true voice, for it has lungs and a trachea, but its tongue <lb/>
            is not free, nor has it any lips so as to make an articulate <lb/>
            sound.</p>
          <p>5. The oviparous quadrupeds, with a tongue and lungs, <note type="footnote">1 Trigla Lyra. </note><note type="footnote">2 Cottus cataphractus. </note><note type="footnote">3 Zeus faber. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Trigla hirundo. </note><note type="footnote">6 Flying fish. </note> <pb n="96"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. IV. </note> <lb/>
            utter a sound, though it is a weak one. Some of them hiss <lb/>
            like serpents ; others have a small weak voice, others, as the <lb/>
            tortoise, utter a small hiss. The tongue of the frog is pe­ <lb/>
            culiar, for the fore-part of it is fixed, like that of a fish ; but <lb/>
            the part near the pharynx is free and folded up. With this it <lb/>
            utters its peculiar sound. The male frogs make a croaking <lb/>
            in the water when they invite the females to coition.</p>
          <p>6. All animals utter a voice to invite the society and proxi­ <lb/>
            mity of their kind, as the hog, the goat, and the sheep. The <lb/>
            frog croaks by making its lower jaw of equal length, and <lb/>
            stretching the upper one above the water. Their eyes ap­ <lb/>
            pear like lights, their cheeks being swelled out with the <lb/>
            vehemence of their croaking ; for their copulation is gene­ <lb/>
            rally performed in the night. The class of birds utter a <lb/>
            voice: those which have a moderately wide tongue have the <lb/>
            best voice; those also in which the tongue is thin. In <lb/>
            some kinds both male and female have the same voice; in <lb/>
            others it is different: the smaller kinds have more variety <lb/>
            in their voice, and make more use of it, than the larger <lb/>
            tribes.</p>
          <p>7. All birds become more noisy at the season of coition. <lb/>
            Some utter a cry when they are fighting, as the quail; others <lb/>
            when they are going to fight, as the partridge; or when they <lb/>
            have obtained a victory, as the cock. In some kinds both <lb/>
            male and female sing, as the nightingale; but the female <lb/>
            nightingale does not sing while she is sitting or feeding her <lb/>
            young: in some the males alone, as the quail and the cock ; <lb/>
            the female has no voice. Viviparous quadrupeds utter dif­ <lb/>
            ferent voices; none can speak-for this is the characteristic <lb/>
            of man, for all that have a language have a voice, but not <lb/>
            all that have a voice have also a language.</p>
          <p>8. All that are born dumb, and all children, utter sounds, <lb/>
            but have no language; for, as children are not complete in <lb/>
            their other parts, so their tongue is not perfect at first; it <lb/>
            becomes more free afterwards, so that they stammer and <lb/>
            lisp. Both voices and language differ in different places.</p>
          <p>9. The voice is most conspicuous in its acuteness or depth, <lb/>
            but the form does not differ in the same species of animals; <lb/>
            the mode of articulation differs, and this might be called <lb/>
            speech, for it differs in different animals, and in the same <lb/>
            genera in different places, as among partridges, for in some <pb n="97"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. IV.] </note> <lb/>
            places they cackle, in others whistle. Small birds do not utter <lb/>
            the same voice as their parents, if they are brought up away <lb/>
            from them, and have only heard other singing birds. For the <lb/>
            nightingale has been observed instructing her young, so <lb/>
            that the voice and speech are not naturally alike, but are <lb/>
            capable of formation. And men also have all the same voice, <lb/>
            however much they may differ in language. The elephant <lb/>
            utters a voice by breathing through its mouth, making no <lb/>
            use of its nose, as when a man breathes forth a sigh; but <lb/>
            with its nose it makes a noise like the hoarse sound of a <lb/>
            trumpet.</p>

          <p>1. CONCERNING the sleep and wakefulness of animals. It is <lb/>
            quite manifest that all viviparous animals with feet both <lb/>
            sleep and are awake; for all that have eyelids sleep with the <lb/>
            eyes closed; and not only men appear to dream, but horses, <lb/>
            oxen, sheep, goats, dogs, and all viviparous quadrupeds. <lb/>
            Dogs show this by barking in their sleep. It is not clear <lb/>
            whether oviparous animals dream, but it is quite plain that <lb/>
            they sleep.</p>
          <p>2. And so it is in aquatic animals, as fish, the malacia, <lb/>
            the malacostraca, the carabi, and such like creatures. The <lb/>
            sleep of all these animals is short: it is plain that they do sleep, <lb/>
            though we can form no conclusion from their eyes, for they <lb/>
            have no eyelids, but from their not being alarmed; for if <lb/>
            fish are not tormented with lice, and what are called psylli, <lb/>
            they may be captured without alarming them, so that they <lb/>
            can be even taken with the hand. And if fish remain at <lb/>
            rest during the night a great multitude of these creatures <lb/>
            fall upon and devour them.</p>
          <p>3. They are found in such numbers at the bottom of the <lb/>
            sea as to devour any bait made of fish that remains any length <lb/>
            of time upon the ground; fishermen frequently draw them <lb/>
            out hanging like globes around the bait. The following con­ <lb/>
            siderations will serve still more to confirm our suppositions <lb/>
            that fishes sleep ; for it is often possible to fall upon the <lb/>
            fish so stealthily as to take by the hand, or even strike them <lb/>
            during this time; they are quite quiet, and exhibit no signs <lb/>
            of motion except with their tails, which they move gently. <lb/>
            It is evident, also, that they sleep, from their starting if <note type="footnote"> H </note> <pb n="98"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. IV. </note> <lb/>
            anything moves while they are asleep, for they start as if <lb/>
            they were waked out of sleep.</p>
          <p>4. They are also taken by torchlight while asleep ; those <lb/>
            who are seeking for thynni surround them while asleep ; it is <lb/>
            evident that they can be captured from their stillness, and <lb/>
            the half-open white (of their eyes). They sleep more by <lb/>
            night than by day, so that they do not move when they are <lb/>
            struck; they generally sleep holding by the ground, or the <lb/>
            sand, or a stone, at the bottom, concealing themselves be­ <lb/>
            neath a rock, or a portion of the shore. The flat fishes <lb/>
            sleep in the sand; they are recognized by their form <lb/>
            in the sand, and are taken by striking them with a spear <lb/>
            with three points. The labrax, chrysophrys, cestreus, <lb/>
            and such-like fish are often taken with the same kind of <lb/>
            weapon while asleep in the day time, but if not taken then, <lb/>
            none of them can be captured with such a spear.</p>
          <p>5. The selache sleep so soundly that they may be taken <lb/>
            with the hand ; the dolphin, whale, and all that have a blow­ <lb/>
            hole, sleep with this organ above the surface of the sea, so <lb/>
            that they can breathe, while gently moving their fins, and <lb/>
            some persons have even heard the dolphin snore. The ma­ <lb/>
            lacia sleep in the same manner as fish, and so do the mala­ <lb/>
            costraca. It is evident from the following considerations <lb/>
            that insects sleep ; for they evidently remain at rest without <lb/>
            motion; this is particularly plain in bees, for they remain <lb/>
            quiet, and cease to hum during the night. This is also evi­ <lb/>
            dent from those insects with which we are most familiar, <lb/>
            for they not only remain quiet during the night because <lb/>
            they cannot see distinctly, for all creatures with hard eyes <lb/>
            have indistinct vision, but they seem no less quiet when <lb/>
            the light of a lamp is set before them.</p>
          <p>6. Man sleeps the most of all animals. Infants and <lb/>
            young children do not dream at all, but dreaming begins in <lb/>
            most at about four or five years old. There have been men <lb/>
            and women who have never dreamt at all; sometimes such <lb/>
            persons, when they have advanced in age, begin to dream ; <lb/>
            this has preceded a change in their body, either for death <lb/>
            or infirmity. This, then, is the manner of sensation, sleep <lb/>
            and wakefulness. <pb n="99"/>

          </ab>
          <p>1. IN some animals the sexes are distinct, in others they are <lb/>
            not so, these are said to beget and be with young by a like­ <lb/>
            ness to other creatures. There is neither male nor female <lb/>
            in fixed animals, nor in testacea. In the malacia and <lb/>
            malacostraca there are male and female individuals, and in <lb/>
            all animals with feet, whether they have two or four, which <lb/>
            produce either an animal, an egg, or a worm from coition.</p>
          <p>2. In other kinds the sexes are either single or not single ; <lb/>
            as in all quadrupeds there is the male and female, in the <lb/>
            testacea it is not so, for as some vegetables are fertile and <lb/>
            others barren, so it is in these. Among insects and fishes <lb/>
            there are some that have no differences of this kind, as the <lb/>
            eel is neither male nor female, nor is anything produced <lb/>
            from them.</p>
          <p>3. But those persons who say that some eels appear to <lb/>
            have creatures like worms, of the size of a hair, attached to <lb/>
            them, speak without observation, not having seen how they <lb/>
            really are; for none of these creatures are viviparous with­ <lb/>
            out being first oviparous, none of them have ever been ob­ <lb/>
            served to contain ova; those that are viviparous have the <lb/>
            embryo attached to the uterus, and not to the abdomen, for <lb/>
            there it would be digested like food. The distinction made <lb/>
            between the so-called male and female eel that the male has <lb/>
            a larger and longer head, and that the head of the female <lb/>
            is smaller, and more rounded, is a generic, and not a sexual <lb/>
            distinction.</p>
          <p>4. There are some fish called epitragiæ, and among fresh- <lb/>
            water fish the cyprinus and balagrus are of the same nature, <lb/>
            which never have ova or semen; those which are firm and <lb/>
            fat, and have a small intestine, appear to be the best. <lb/>
            There are creatures, such as the testacea, and plants, which <lb/>
            beget, and produce young, but have no organ of coition; <lb/>
            and so also in fishes the psetus,l erythrhinus,2 and the channa. <lb/>
            All these appear to have ova.</p>
          <p>5. In sanguineous animals with feet that are not ovipa­ <lb/>
            rous, the males are generally larger and longer lived than <note type="footnote">1 Pleuronectes Lingua and Rhombus. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Perca marina, or Sparus erithrinue. </note> <pb n="100"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. IV. </note> <lb/>
            the females, except the hemionus, but the females of this <lb/>
            animal are both larger and longer lived: in oviparous and <lb/>
            viviparous animals, as in fish and insects, the females are <lb/>
            larger than the males, as the serpent, phalangium,l ascala­ <lb/>
            botes,2 and frog; in fish likewise, as in most of the small <lb/>
            gregarious selache, and all that inhabit rocks.</p>
          <p>6. It is evident that female fishes have longer lives than <lb/>
            males, because females are caught of a greater age than the <lb/>
            males; the upper and more forward parts of all animals <lb/>
            are larger and stronger, and more firmly built in the male ; <lb/>
            the hinder and lower parts in the female. This is the case <lb/>
            in the human subject, and all viviparous animals with feet: <lb/>
            the female is less sinewy, the joints are weaker, and the <lb/>
            hairs finer, in those with hair; in those without hair, its <lb/>
            analogues are of the same nature; the female has softer <lb/>
            flesh and weaker knees than the male, the legs are slighter; <lb/>
            the feet of females are more graceful, in all that have <lb/>
            these members.</p>
          <p>7. All females, also, have a smaller and more acute voice <lb/>
            than the males, but in oxen the females utter a deeper sound <lb/>
            than the males; the parts denoting strength, as the teeth, <lb/>
            tusks, horns, and spurs, and such other parts, are possessed <lb/>
            by the males, but not by the females, as the roe-deer has <lb/>
            none, and the hens of some birds with spurs have none; <lb/>
            the sow has no tusks : in some animals they exist in both <lb/>
            sexes, only stronger and longer in the males, as the horns of <lb/>
            bulls are stronger than those of cows. <note type="footnote"> 1 Aranca tarantula. </note><note type="footnote">2 Lacerta Gekkc. </note> <pb n="101"/>

          <p>1. WE have hitherto treated of the external and internal <lb/>
            parts of all animals, of their senses, voice, and sleep, with <lb/>
            the distinctions between the males and females; it remains <lb/>
            to treat of their generation, speaking first of those which <lb/>
            come first in order, for they are many, and have numerous <lb/>
            varieties, partly dissimilar, and partly like each other. And <lb/>
            we will pursue the same order in considering them as we <lb/>
            did before in their division into classes ; we commenced our <lb/>
            consideration by treating of the parts in man, but now he <lb/>
            must be treated of last, because he is much more intricate.</p>
          <p>2. We shall begin with the testacea, and after these treat <lb/>
            of the malacostraca, and the others in the order of their <lb/>
            succession. These are the malacia and insects, next to <lb/>
            these fishes, both viviparous and oviparous; next to them <lb/>
            birds, and afterwards we must treat of animals with feet, <lb/>
            whether viviparous or oviparous ; some viviparous creatures <lb/>
            have four feet, man alone has two feet. The nature of ani­ <lb/>
            mals and vegetables is similar, for some are produced from <lb/>
            the seed of other plants, and others are of spontaneous <lb/>
            growth, being derived from some origin of a similar nature. <lb/>
            Some of them acquire their nourishment from the soil, <lb/>
            others from different plants, as it was observed when treat­ <lb/>
            ing of plants.</p>
          <p>3. So also some animals are produced from animals of <lb/>
            a similar form, the origin of others is spontaneous, and <lb/>
            not from similar forms; from these and from plants are <lb/>
            divided those which spring from putrid matter, this is the <lb/>
            case with many insects; others originate in the animals <lb/>
            themselves, and from the excrementitious matter in their <lb/>
            parts ; those which originate from similar animals, and have <lb/>
            both the sexes are produced from coition, but of the class of <lb/>
            fishes there are some neither male nor female, these belong <lb/>
            to the same class among fishes, but to different genera, and <lb/>
            some are quite peculiar. In some there are females but no <lb/>
            males, by these the species is continued as in the hypenemia <lb/>
            among birds. <pb n="102"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin"> [B. V. </note> 4. All these among birds are barren, (for nature is <lb/>
            able to complete them as far as the formation of an egg,) <lb/>
            unless persons suppose that there is another method of <lb/>
            communicating the male influence, concerning which we <lb/>
            shall speak more plainly hereafter. In some fish, after the, <lb/>
            spontaneous production of the ovum, it happens that living <lb/>
            creatures are produced, some by themselves, others by the <lb/>
            aid of the male. The manner in which this is done will be <lb/>
            made plain in a future place, for nearly the same things take <lb/>
            place in the class of birds.</p>
          <p>5. Whatever are produced spontaneously in living crea. <lb/>
            tures, in the earth, or in plants, or in any part of them, <lb/>
            have a distinction in the sexes, and by the union of the <lb/>
            sexes something is produced, not the same in any respect, <lb/>
            but an imperfect animal, as nits are produced from lice, <lb/>
            and from flies and butterflies are produced egg - like <lb/>
            worms, from which neither similar creatures are produced, <lb/>
            nor any other creature, but such things only. First of <lb/>
            all, then, we will treat of coition, and of the animals that <lb/>
            copulate, and then of others, and successively of that which <lb/>
            is peculiar to each, and that which is common to them all.</p>

          <p>1. THOSE animals in which there is a distinction of the <lb/>
            sexes use sexual intercourse, but the mode of this intercourse <lb/>
            is not the same in all, for all the males of sanguineous <lb/>
            animals with feet have an appropriate organ, but they do <lb/>
            not all approach the female in the same manner, but those <lb/>
            which are retromingent, as the lion, the hare, and the lynx, <lb/>
            unite backwards, and the female hare often mounts upon <lb/>
            the male; in almost all the rest the mode is the same, for <lb/>
            most animals perform the act of intercourse in the same way, <lb/>
            the male mounting upon the female; and birds perform <lb/>
            it in this way only.</p>
          <p>2. There are, however, some variations even among birds; <lb/>
            for the male sometimes unites with the female as she sits <lb/>
            upon the ground, as the bustard and domestic fowl: in <lb/>
            others, the female does not sit upon the ground, as the <lb/>
            crane; for in these birds the male unites with the female <lb/>
            standing up; and the act is performed very quickly, as in <lb/>
            sparrows. Bears lie down during the act of intercourse, <pb n="103"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. V.] </note> <lb/>
            which is performed in the same manner as in those that <lb/>
            stand on their feet, the abdomen of the male being placed <lb/>
            upon the back of the female: in the hedgehogs, the abdo­ <lb/>
            mens of both sexes are in contact.</p>
          <p>3. Among the large animals, the roe-deer seldom admits <lb/>
            the stag, nor the cow the bull, on account of the hardness <lb/>
            of the penis ; but the female receives the male by sub­ <lb/>
            mission. This has been observed to take place in tame <lb/>
            deer. The male and female wolf copulate like dogs. Cats <lb/>
            do not approach each other backwards, but the male stands <lb/>
            erect, and the female places herself beneath him. The fe­ <lb/>
            males are very lascivious, and invite the male, and make a <lb/>
            noise during the intercourse.</p>
          <p>4. Camels copulate as the female is lying down, and the <lb/>
            male embraces and unites with her, not backwards, but like <lb/>
            other animals. They remain in intercourse a whole day. <lb/>
            They retire into a desert place, and suffer no one to ap­ <lb/>
            proach them but their feeder. The penis of the camel is so <lb/>
            strong, that bowstrings are made of it. Elephants also <lb/>
            retire into desert places for intercourse, especially by the <lb/>
            sides of rivers which they usually frequent. The female <lb/>
            bends down and divides her legs, and the male mounts upon <lb/>
            her. The seal copulates like retromingent animals, and is a <lb/>
            long while about it, like dogs. The males have a large penis.</p>

            <title type="sub">CHAPTER III.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. OVIPAROUS quarupeds with feet copulate in the same <lb/>
            manner: in some, the male mounts upon the female, like <lb/>
            viviparous animals, as in the marine and land turtle, for <lb/>
            they have an intromittent organ by which they adhere toge­ <lb/>
            ther, as the trygon and frog, and all such animals.</p>
          <p>2. But the apodous long animals, as serpents and mu­ <lb/>
            rænæ, are folded together, with the abdomens opposite, and <lb/>
            serpents roll themselves together so closely, that they seem <lb/>
            to be but one serpent with two heads. The manner of the <lb/>
            whole race of saurians is the same, for they unite together <lb/>
            in the same kind of fold.</p>

            <title type="sub">CHAPTER IV.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. ALL fish, except the flat selache, perform the act of <lb/>
            intercourse by approaching each other with their abdomens <pb n="104"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. V. </note> <lb/>
            opposite: but the flat fish, with tails, as the batos, trygon, <lb/>
            and such like, not only approach each other, but the male <lb/>
            applies his abdomen to the back of the female, in all those <lb/>
            in which the thickness of the tail offers no impediment. <lb/>
            But the rhinæ, and those which have a large tail, perform <lb/>
            the act by the friction of their abdomens against each other, <lb/>
            and some persons say that they have seen the male selache <lb/>
            united to the back of the female, like dogs.</p>
          <p>2. In all those that resemble the selache, the female is <lb/>
            larger than the male; and in nearly all fish the female is <lb/>
            larger than the male. The selache are those which have <lb/>
            been mentioned; and the bos, lamia, fetus, narce, batra­ <lb/>
            chus, and all the galeode. All the selache have been fre­ <lb/>
            quently observed to conduct themselves in this way. In all <lb/>
            viviparous creatures the act occupies a longer time than in <lb/>
            the oviparous. The dolphin and the cetacea also perform <lb/>
            the act in the same manner, for the male attaches himself to <lb/>
            the female for neither a very long, nor a very short time.</p>
          <p>3. The males of some of the fish which resemble the <lb/>
            selache differ from the females, in having two appendages <lb/>
            near the anus, which the females have not, as in the gale­ <lb/>
            odea ; for these appendages exist in them all. Neither fish <lb/>
            nor any other apodal animal has testicles, but the males, <lb/>
            both of serpents and of fish, have two passages, which be­ <lb/>
            come full of a seminal fluid at the season of coition; and all <lb/>
            of them project a milky fluid. These passages unite in one, <lb/>
            as they do in birds; for birds have two internal testes, and <lb/>
            so have all oviparous animals with feet. In the act of <lb/>
            coition this single passage passes to, and is extended upon <lb/>
            the pudendum and receptacle of the female.</p>
          <p>4. In viviparous animals with feet, the external passage <lb/>
            for the semen and the fluid excrement is the same: inter­ <lb/>
            nally these passages are distinct, as I said before in descri­ <lb/>
            bing the distinctive parts of animals. In animals which <lb/>
            have no bladder, the anus is externally united with the <lb/>
            passage of the semen, internally the passages are close <lb/>
            together; and this is the same in both sexes: for none of <lb/>
            of them have a bladder, except the tortoise. The female of <lb/>
            this animal, though furnished with a bladder, has but one <lb/>
            passage ; but the tortoise is oviparous.</p>
          <p>5. The sexual intercourse of the oviparous fish is less evident, <pb n="105"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. V.] </note> <lb/>
            wherefore many persons suppose that the female is impreg­ <lb/>
            nated by swallowing the semen of the male ; and they have <lb/>
            been frequently observed to do this. This is seen at the <lb/>
            Season of coition, when the females follow the males, and are <lb/>
            observed to strike them on the abdomen with their mouths, <lb/>
            this causes the males to eject their semen more rapidly. <lb/>
            The males do the same with the ova of the females, for they <lb/>
            swallow them as they are extruded, and the fish are born <lb/>
            from those ova which remain.</p>
          <p>6. In Phœnicia they use each sex for capturing the other ; <lb/>
            for having taken the male cestreus, they entice the females <lb/>
            with it, and so enclose them in a net. They use the females <lb/>
            in the same way for catching the males. The frequent obser­ <lb/>
            vation of these circumstances appears to corroborate this <lb/>
            manner of intercourse among them. Quadrupeds also do <lb/>
            the same thing, for at the season of coition both sexes emit <lb/>
            a fluid, and smell to each other's pudenda.</p>
          <p>7. And if the wind blows from the cock partridge to <lb/>
            the hen, these last are impregnated ; and often, if they hear <lb/>
            the voice of the cock when they are inclined for sexual <lb/>
            intercourse, or if he flies over them, they become pregnant <lb/>
            from the breath of the cock. During the act of intercourse, <lb/>
            both sexes open their mouths, and protrude their tongues. <lb/>
            The true intercourse of oviparous fish is rarely observed, <lb/>
            from the rapidity with which the act is accomplished; for <lb/>
            their intercourse has been observed to take place in the <lb/>
            manner described.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER V.</title>

          <p>1. ALL the malacia, as the polypus, sepia, and touting, <lb/>
            approach each other in the same manner, for they are united <lb/>
            mouth to mouth; the tentacula of one sex being adapted to <lb/>
            those of the other; for when the polypus has fixed the part <lb/>
            called the head upon the ground, it extends its tentacula, <lb/>
            which the other adapts to the expansion of its tentacula, <lb/>
            and they make their acetabula answer together. And some <lb/>
            persons say that the male has an organ like a penis in that <lb/>
            one of its tentacula which contains the two largest aceta­ <lb/>
            bula. This organ is sinewy, as far as the middle of the ten­ <lb/>
            taculum, and they say that it is all inserted into the nostril <lb/>
            of the female. <pb n="106"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. V. </note></p>
          <p>2. The sepia and loligo swim about coiled together in this <lb/>
            way, and with their mouths and tentacula united, they swim <lb/>
            in contrary directions to each other. They adapt the organ <lb/>
            called the nostril of the male to the similar organ in the <lb/>
            female; and the one swims forwards, and the other back­ <lb/>
            wards. The ova of the female are produced in the part <lb/>
            called the physeter, by means of which some persons say <lb/>
            that they copulate.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER VI.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. THE malacostraca, as the carabi, astaci, carides, and such <lb/>
            like perform the act of intercourse like the retromingent <lb/>
            animals, the one lying upon its back, and the other placing <lb/>
            its tail upon it. They copulate on the approach of spring, <lb/>
            near the land; for their sexual intercourse has often been <lb/>
            observed, and sometimes when the figs begin to ripen.</p>
          <p>2. The astaci and the carides perform the act in the same <lb/>
            manner; but the carcini approximate the fore part of their <lb/>
            bodies to each other, and adapt also the folds of their tails to <lb/>
            each other. First of all, the smaller carcinus mounts from <lb/>
            behind, and when he has mounted, the greater one turns <lb/>
            on its side. In no other respect does the female differ <lb/>
            from the male, but that the tail, which is folded on the <lb/>
            body, is larger and more distant, and more thick set with <lb/>
            appendages : upon this the ova are deposited, and the excre­ <lb/>
            ment ejected. Neither sex is furnished with an intromittent <lb/>
            organ.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER VII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. INSECTS approach each other from behind, and the <lb/>
            smaller one subsequently mounts upon the larger. The <lb/>
            male is always the smaller. The female, which is below, <lb/>
            inserts a member into the male, which is above, and not the <lb/>
            male into the female, as in other animals. In some kinds <lb/>
            this organ appears large in proportion to the size of the <lb/>
            body, especially in those that are small, in others it is less. <lb/>
            The organ may be plainly discerned if two flies are sepa­ <lb/>
            rated while in the act of coition. They are separated from <lb/>
            each other with difficulty, for the act of intercourse in such <lb/>
            animals occupies a long time. This may be plainly discerned <lb/>
            by common observation, as in the fly and cantharis.</p>
          <p>2. All adopt the same method, the fly, cantharis, spon- <pb n="107"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. V.] </note> <lb/>
            dyla1, phalangium, or any other insect that copulates. All <lb/>
            the phalangia that spin a web unite in the following manner. <lb/>
            The female draws a filament from the middle of the web, and <lb/>
            then the male draws it back again, and this they do a great <lb/>
            many times till they meet, and are united backwards, for <lb/>
            this kind of copulation suits them on account of the size <lb/>
            of their abdomen. The copulation of animals is accom­ <lb/>
            plished in this manner.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER VIII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. ALL animals have their proper season and age for coition; <lb/>
            the nature of most creatures requires them to have inter­ <lb/>
            course with each other when winter is turning into summer. <lb/>
            This is the spring season, in which all animals with wings, <lb/>
            feet, or fins, are incited to coition. Some copulate and pro­ <lb/>
            duce their young in the autumn and winter, as some aquatic <lb/>
            and winged creatures. Mankind are ready at all seasons, <lb/>
            and so are many other animals which associate with man ; <lb/>
            this arises from greater warmth, and better food, and is <lb/>
            usual among those which are pregnant only for a short time, <lb/>
            as the hog, dog, and those birds which have frequent <lb/>
            broods. Many animals appear to adapt the season of coi­ <lb/>
            tion to that which they consider the best for the nurture of <lb/>
            their young.</p>
          <p>2. Among mankind the male is more disposed for sexual <lb/>
            intercourse in the winter, and the female in the summer. <lb/>
            Birds, as I have observed, generally pair in the spring and <lb/>
            summer, except the halcyon. This bird hatches its young <lb/>
            about the time of the winter solstice. Whereupon fine days <lb/>
            occurring at this season are called halcyon days, seven before <lb/>
            the solstice and seven after it. As Simonides also writes <lb/>
            in his poems, " as when in the winter months Jupiter pre­ <lb/>
            pares fourteen days, which mortals call the windless season, <lb/>
            the sacred nurse of the variegated halcyon."</p>
          <p>3. These fine days take place wherever it happens that <lb/>
            the solstice turns to the south, when the pleiades set in the <lb/>
            north. The bird is said to occupy seven days in building <lb/>
            its nest, and the other seven in bringing out and nursing <lb/>
            its young. The halcyon days axe not always met with in this <note type="footnote">1 A beetle living at the roots of trees, Carabus. </note> <pb n="108"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. V. </note> <lb/>
            country at the time of the solstice, but they always occur in <lb/>
            the Sicilian Sea. The halcyon produces five eggs.</p>
          <p>4. The æthuia and the larus hatch their young among the <lb/>
            rocks on the sea-side, and produce two or three, the larus <lb/>
            during the summer, and the æthuia at the beginning of the <lb/>
            spring, immediately after the equinox ; it sets upon its eggs <lb/>
            like other birds ; neither of these kinds conceal themselves. <lb/>
            The halcyon is the rarest of all, for it is only seen at the <lb/>
            season of the setting of the pleiades, and at the solstice, and <lb/>
            it first appears at seaports, flying as much as round a ship, <lb/>
            and immediately vanishing away. Stesichorus also speaks <lb/>
            of it in the same manner.</p>
          <p>5. The nightingale produces her young at the beginning <lb/>
            of summer. She produces five or six eggs. She conceals <lb/>
            herself from the autumn to the beginning of spring. Insects <lb/>
            copulate and produce their young during the winter when­ <lb/>
            ever the days are fine, and the wind in the south, at least <lb/>
            such of them as do not conceal themselves, as the fly and <lb/>
            ant. Wild animals produce their young once a year, unless, <lb/>
            like the hare, they breed while they are nursing their young.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER IX.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. FISH also generally breed once a year, as the chyti. All <lb/>
            those which are caught in a net are called chyti; the thyn­ <lb/>
            nus, palamis, cestreus, chalais, colias, chromis, psetta, and <lb/>
            such like, the labrax is an exception, for this alone of them <lb/>
            all breeds twice a year, and the second fry of these are much <lb/>
            weaker. The trichias1 and rock fish breed twice, the trigla is <lb/>
            the only one that breeds three times a year. This is shewn <lb/>
            by the fry, which appear three times at certain places.</p>
          <p>2. The scorpius breeds twice, and so does the sargus, in <lb/>
            spring and autumn, the salpa once only in the spring. The <lb/>
            thynnis breeds once, but as some of the fry are produced <lb/>
            at first, and others afterwards, it appears to breed twice. <lb/>
            The first fry makes its appearance in the month of Decem­ <lb/>
            ber, after the solstice, the second in the spring. The male <lb/>
            thynnis is different from the female, for the female has a fin <lb/>
            under the abdomen, called aphareus, which the male has not.</p>
          <p>3. Among the selachea, the rhine alone breeds twice in <lb/>
            the year; at the beginning of the autumn, and at the period <note type="footnote">1 Clupea Sprottus. </note> <pb n="109"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. V.] </note> <lb/>
            of the setting of the Pleiades. The young are, however, better <lb/>
            in the autumn. At each breeding season it produces seven or <lb/>
            eight. Some of the galei, as the asterias, seem to produce <lb/>
            their ova twice every month. This arises from all the ova <lb/>
            not being perfected at once.</p>
          <p>4. Some fish produce ova at all seasons of the year, as the <lb/>
            muræna: for this fish produces many ova, and the fry <lb/>
            rapidly increase in size, as do those also of the hippurus,1 for <lb/>
            these, from being very small, rapidly increase to a great <lb/>
            size; but the muræna produces young at all seasons, the <lb/>
            hippurus in the spring. The smyrus differs from the mu­ <lb/>
            raena, for the muræna is throughout variegated and weak. <lb/>
            The smyrus is of one colour, and strong ; its colour is that <lb/>
            of the pine tree, and it has teeth both internally and ex­ <lb/>
            ternally. They say that these are the male and the female, <lb/>
            as in others. These creatures go upon the land, and are <lb/>
            often taken.</p>
          <p>5. The growth of all fish is rapid, and not the least so in <lb/>
            the coracinus among small fish. It breeds near the land, <lb/>
            in thick places full of seaweed. The orphos also grows <lb/>
            rapidly. The pelamis and thynnus breed in Pontus, and <lb/>
            nowhere else. The cestreus, chrysophrys, and labrax, breed <lb/>
            near the mouths of rivers. The orcynes and scorpides, and <lb/>
            many other kinds, in the sea.</p>
          <p>6. Most fish breed in March, April, and May; a few <lb/>
            in the autumn, as the salpe, sargus, and all the others of <lb/>
            this kind a little before the autumnal equinox; and the <lb/>
            narce and rhine also. Some breed in the winter and summer, <lb/>
            as I before observed, as the labrax, cestreus, and belona in <lb/>
            the winter; the thynnis in June, about the summer sol­ <lb/>
            stice : it produces, as it were, a bag, containing many <lb/>
            minute ova. The rhyas also breeds in the summer. The <lb/>
            chelones among the cestræi begin to breed in the month of <lb/>
            December, and so does the sargus, the myxon, as it is <lb/>
            called, and the cephalus. They go with young thirty <lb/>
            days. Some of the cestrei do not originate in coition, but. <lb/>
            are produced from mud and sand.</p>
          <p>7. The greater number of them contain ova in the <lb/>
            spring, but some, as I observed, in the summer, autumn, <lb/>
            and winter. But this does not take place in all alike, <note type="footnote">1 Coryphoena hippurus. </note> <pb n="110"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. V. </note> <lb/>
            nor singly, nor in every kind, as it does in most fish <lb/>
            which produce their young in the spring: nor do they <lb/>
            produce as many ova at other seasons. But it must <lb/>
            not escape our notice, that as different countries make a <lb/>
            great difference in plants and animals, not only in the habit <lb/>
            of their body, but also in the frequency of their sexual in­ <lb/>
            tercourse and production of young; so different localities <lb/>
            make a great difference in fish, not only in their size, and <lb/>
            habit of their body, but in their young, and the frequency <lb/>
            or rarity of their sexual intercourse, and of their offspring <lb/>
            in this place or that.</p>

          <p>1. THE malacia breed in the spring, and first of all the marine <lb/>
            sepia, though this one breeds at all seasons. It produces <lb/>
            its ova in fifteen days. When the ova are extruded, the <lb/>
            male follows, and ejects his ink upon them, when they be­ <lb/>
            come hard. They go about in pairs. The male is more <lb/>
            variegated than the female, and blacker on the back. The <lb/>
            sexes of the polypus unite in the winter, the young are pro­ <lb/>
            duced in the spring, when these creatures conceal themselves <lb/>
            for two months. It produces an ovum like long hair, similar <lb/>
            to the fruit of the white poplar. The fecundity of this animal <lb/>
            is very great, for a great number of young are produced <lb/>
            from its ova. The male differs from the female in having a <lb/>
            longer head, and the part of the tentaculum which the fish­ <lb/>
            ermen call the penis is white. It incubates upon the ova <lb/>
            it produces, so that it becomes out of condition, and is not <lb/>
            sought after at this season.</p>
          <p>2. The purpuræ produce their ova in the spring, the <lb/>
            ceryx at the end of the winter; and, on the whole, the <lb/>
            testacea appear to contain ova in the spring and autumn, <lb/>
            except the eatable echini. These principally produce their <lb/>
            young at the same seasons, but they always contain some <lb/>
            ova, and especially at the full and new moon, and in fine <lb/>
            weather, but those which live in the Euripus of the Pyrrhæi <lb/>
            are better in winter. They are a small kind but full of ova. <lb/>
            All the cochleæ appear to contain ova at the same season.</p>

          <p>1. THE undomesticated birds, as it was observed, generally <lb/>
            pair and breed once a-year. The swallows and cottyphus <pb n="111"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. V.] </note> <lb/>
            breed twice, but the first brood of the cottyphus is killed <lb/>
            by the cold, for it is the earliest breeder of all birds. It <lb/>
            is able, however, to bring up the other brood. But the <lb/>
            domestic birds, and those capable of domestication, breed <lb/>
            frequently, as pigeons during the whole summer, and do­ <lb/>
            mestic fowls. For these birds have sexual intercourse, and <lb/>
            produce eggs all the year round, except at the winter <lb/>
            solstice.</p>
          <p>2. There are many kinds of pigeons, for the peleias and <lb/>
            peristera are different. The peleias is the smaller, but <lb/>
            the peristera is more readily tamed. The peleias is black <lb/>
            and small, and has red and rough feet, for which reason <lb/>
            it is never domesticated. The phatta is the largest of <lb/>
            the tribe, the next is the œnas, which is a little larger than <lb/>
            the peristera, the trygon is the least of all. If the peristera <lb/>
            is supplied with a warm place and appropriate food, it will <lb/>
            breed and bring up its young at any season of the year. If <lb/>
            it is not properly supplied, it will only breed in the summer. <lb/>
            Its young ones are best during the spring and autumn, <lb/>
            those produced in the hot weather in summer are the worst.</p>

          <p>1. ANIMALS also differ in the age at which sexual inter­ <lb/>
            course commences. For in the first place the period at <lb/>
            which the spermatic fluid begins to be secreted, and the age <lb/>
            of puberty is not the same, but different; for the young of <lb/>
            all animals are barren, or if they do possess the power of <lb/>
            reproduction, their offspring are weak and small. This is <lb/>
            very conspicuous in mankind, and in viviparous quadrupeds <lb/>
            and birds, for in the one the offspring, in the other the <lb/>
            eggs, are small. The age of puberty is nearly the same in <lb/>
            the individuals of each kind, unless any alteration takes <lb/>
            place, either as ominous, or from an injury done to their <lb/>
            nature.</p>
          <p>2. In men this period of life is shown by the change of <lb/>
            voice, and not only by the size but by the form of the <lb/>
            pudendum and of the breasts in women, but especially by <lb/>
            the growth of hair on the pubes. The secretion of the <lb/>
            spermatic fluid commences about the age of fourteen, the <lb/>
            power of reproduction at twenty-one. Other animals have <lb/>
            no hair on the pubes, for some have no hair at all, and <pb n="112"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. V. </note> <lb/>
            others have none upon their under side, or less than on <lb/>
            their upper side, but the change of the voice is conspicuous <lb/>
            in some of them. And in others different parts of the body <lb/>
            signify the period of the formation of the semen, and of the <lb/>
            power of reproduction.</p>
          <p>3. In almost all animals the voice of the female and of <lb/>
            the young is more acute than that of the male and the older <lb/>
            animals, for even the stags have a deeper voice than their <lb/>
            females. The males utter their cry at the season of copula. <lb/>
            tion, the females when they are alarmed. The voice of the <lb/>
            female is short, that of the male longer. And the barking ot <lb/>
            old dogs is also deeper than of young ones, and the voice of <lb/>
            the horse also varies. The females utter a little small cry <lb/>
            as soon as they are born, and the males do the same, but <lb/>
            their voice is deeper than that of the female, and as they <lb/>
            grow older, it still increases. When they are two years <lb/>
            old, and reach puberty, the male utters a great deep voice, <lb/>
            that of the female is greater and clearer than it was at first; <lb/>
            this continues till they are twenty years old at the outside, <lb/>
            and after that the voice, both of the male and female, be­ <lb/>
            comes weaker.</p>
          <p>4. For the most part, then, as we observed, the voice of <lb/>
            the male differs from that of the female in depth, in those <lb/>
            animals which utter a lengthened sound. There are, how­ <lb/>
            ever, some exceptions, as oxen; for in these animals the <lb/>
            voice of the female is deeper than that of the male, and the <lb/>
            voice of the calf than that of the full-grown animal; where­ <lb/>
            fore also in the castrated animals, the voice changes the <lb/>
            other way, for it becomes more like that of the female.</p>
          <p>5. The following are the ages at which animals acquire <lb/>
            the power of reproduction. The sheep and goat arrive at <lb/>
            puberty within a year after they are born, and especially <lb/>
            the goat, and the males as well as the females, but the off­ <lb/>
            spring of these males and of the others is different. <lb/>
            For the males are better the second year than when they <lb/>
            become older. In hogs, the male and female unite at eight <lb/>
            months old, and the female produces her young when she is <lb/>
            a year old, for this agrees with the period of gestation. <lb/>
            The male reaches puberty at eight months old, but his off­ <lb/>
            spring are useless till he is a year old. But these periods, <lb/>
            as we have said, are not always the same, for swine will <pb n="113"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. V.] </note> <lb/>
            sometimes copulate when they are four months old, so as to <lb/>
            have young and nurse them at six months old, and boars <lb/>
            sometimes reach puberty at ten months old, and continue <lb/>
            good to three years old.</p>
          <p>6. The bitch reaches puberty within a year after birth, <lb/>
            and so does the dog, and sometimes this takes place at <lb/>
            the end of eight months, but more frequently in the <lb/>
            male than in the female. The period of gestation is <lb/>
            sixty days, or one or two, or perhaps three days more, but <lb/>
            never less than sixty days, or if they produce young in a <lb/>
            less time, it never comes to perfection. The bitch is ready <lb/>
            for sexual intercourse again in six months, but never sooner. <lb/>
            The horse reaches puberty in both sexes at two years old, <lb/>
            and is capable of reproduction, but its offspring at that age <lb/>
            are small and weakly. For the most part, sexual inter­ <lb/>
            course begins at three years of age, and the colts continue to <lb/>
            improve from that period till they are twenty years old. <lb/>
            The male is useful till he is thirty years old, so that he can <lb/>
            beget during almost the whole of his life, for the horse <lb/>
            generally lives five-and-thirty years, and the mare more than <lb/>
            forty, and a horse has been known to live seventy-five years.</p>
          <p>7. The ass reaches puberty in both sexes at the age of <lb/>
            thirty months ; they rarely, however, produce young till <lb/>
            they are three years, or three years and six months old. <lb/>
            But it has been known to be pregnant and bring up its <lb/>
            young within the year. The cow also has been known to <lb/>
            produce young and rear it within the year after birth, which <lb/>
            grew to the ordinary size, and no more.1</p>
          <p>8. These are the periods of puberty in these animals. <lb/>
            The seventieth year in man, and the fiftieth in woman, <lb/>
            is the latest period of reproduction, and this happens <lb/>
            rarely, for only a few have had children at this time of life. <lb/>
            Sixty-five is generally the boundary in one sex, and forty­ <lb/>
            five in the other. The sheep produces young till it is eight <lb/>
            years old, and, if well treated, until it is eleven, though the <lb/>
            act of copulation is continued in both sexes during the <lb/>
            whole period of life.</p>
          <p>9. Fat goats are rarely productive, wherefore they com­ <lb/>
            pare barren vines with barren goats, but they are pro- <note type="footnote">1 This probably means " to such a size as might be expected from <lb/>
            the early age of the parent." </note> <note type="footnote"> <unclear>I</unclear> </note> <pb n="114"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. V. </note> <lb/>
            ductive when they are lean. The rams copulate with the <lb/>
            old sheep first, but they do not follow after the younger; <lb/>
            and the younger, as I before observed, produce a smaller <lb/>
            offspring than the older.</p>
          <p>10. A wild boar will beget till he is three years old, <lb/>
            but the progeny of older animals is inferior; for he has <lb/>
            not the same power or strength. He generally goes to the <lb/>
            female when full of food, and without having been to <lb/>
            another female, or, if not, the act of coition is of shorter <lb/>
            duration, and the progeny smaller. The sow produces the <lb/>
            smallest number of pigs at her first litter, but at the second <lb/>
            they are more flourishing. She also produces young when <lb/>
            old, but the act of coition is longer. At fifteen years old, <lb/>
            she no longer produces young, but becomes fierce.</p>
          <p>11. If well-fed, she will be more ready for sexual in­ <lb/>
            tercourse, whether young or old; and, if rapidly fattened <lb/>
            when pregnant, she has less milk after parturition. As <lb/>
            regards the age of the parent, the young of those in the <lb/>
            prime of their age are the best, and those that are born at <lb/>
            the beginning of winter. The worst are those born in the <lb/>
            summer, for they are small, and thin, and weak. If the <lb/>
            male is well fed, he is ready for sexual intercourse at all <lb/>
            seasons, by day as well as by night; but if not well fed, he <lb/>
            is most ready in the morning, and as he grows old, be be­ <lb/>
            comes less disposed for it, as was said before. And it fre­ <lb/>
            quently happens that those which are impotent, through <lb/>
            age or weakness, and cannot copulate readily, will approach <lb/>
            the female as she lies down tired with long standing. The <lb/>
            sow generally becomes pregnant when she hangs down <lb/>
            her ears in her heats; if she is not pregnant, she becomes <lb/>
            heated again.</p>
          <p>12. Bitches do not copulate during the whole of their <lb/>
            life, but only to a certain period. Their coition and preg­ <lb/>
            nancy generally takes place till they are twelve years old, <lb/>
            but both males and females have been known to perform <lb/>
            the act of coition at eighteen and even twenty years of <lb/>
            age; but old age takes away from both sexes the power of <lb/>
            reproduction, as in other animals.</p>
          <p>13. The camel is retroningent, and performs the act of <lb/>
            intercourse in the manner already described; the period of <lb/>
            its coition in Arabia is in the month of September; the <pb n="115"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. V.] </note> <lb/>
            female goes with young twelve months, and produces one <lb/>
            foal, for the animal is one of those which produce but <lb/>
            one. Both the male and female arrive at puberty at the <lb/>
            age of three years, and the female is ready for the male <lb/>
            again at the end of a year after parturition.</p>
          <p>14. The elephant arrives at puberty, the earliest at ten <lb/>
            years of age, the latest at fifteen, and the male at five or six <lb/>
            years old. The season for the intercourse of the sexes is <lb/>
            in the spring: and the male is ready again at the end of <lb/>
            three years, but he never touches again a female whom he <lb/>
            has once impregnated. Her period of gestation is two years, <lb/>
            and then she produces one calf, for the elephant belongs to <lb/>
            the class of animals which have but one young one at a <lb/>
            time. The young one is as large as a calf of two or three <lb/>
            months old. This, then, is the nature of the sexual inter­ <lb/>
            course of those animals which perform this function.</p>

          <p>1. WE must now treat of the mode of reproduction, both of <lb/>
            those animals which use sexual intercourse, and those which <lb/>
            do not; and, first of all, we will speak of the testacea, for <lb/>
            this is the only entire class which is not reproduced by <lb/>
            sexual intercourse. The purpuræ collect together in the <lb/>
            spring, and produce what is called their nidamental capsules <lb/>
            (melicera), for it is like honey-comb, though not so deeply <lb/>
            cut, but, as it were, made up of the white pods of vetches. <lb/>
            These capsules have neither opening nor perforation, nor are <lb/>
            the purpuræ produced from them ; but both these and other <lb/>
            testacea are produced from mud and putrefaction. But <lb/>
            this substance is an excrementitious matter both in the pur­ <lb/>
            pura and the ceryx, for these last also produce similar cap­ <lb/>
            sules.</p>
          <p>2. The testacea which produce these capsules are gene­ <lb/>
            rated in the same way as the rest of their class, but more <lb/>
            readily when there are homogeneous particles pre-existing <lb/>
            among them ; for, when they deposit their nidamental cap­ <lb/>
            sules, they emit a clammy mucus, from which the scales of <lb/>
            the capsules are formed. When all these have been depo­ <lb/>
            sited, they emit upon the ground a sort of chyle, and small <lb/>
            purpuræ spring up upon the same spot and adhere to the <lb/>
            larger purpuræ, though some of these can hardly be dis­ <pb n="116"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. V. </note> <lb/>
            tinguished by their form. But if they are taken before <lb/>
            the breeding season, they will sometimes breed in the <lb/>
            baskets, not indeed anywhere, but they collect together <lb/>
            like they do in the sea, and the narrow limits of their place <lb/>
            of captivity make them hang together like bunches of fruit.</p>
          <p>3. There are many kinds of purpuræ, some of which are <lb/>
            large, as those which are found near Sigeum and Lectum ; <lb/>
            and others are small, as those in the Euripus and on the <lb/>
            Carian coast. Those found in gulfs are large and rough. <lb/>
            Most of them contain a black pigment; in others it is red, <lb/>
            and the quantity of it small. Some of the largest weigh <lb/>
            as much as a mina. Near the shore and on the coast they <lb/>
            are small, and the pigment is red. Those which are natives <lb/>
            of the north contain a black pigment; in those of the south <lb/>
            it is red, generally speaking.</p>
          <p>4. They are taken in the spring, about the time that they <lb/>
            deposit their capsules, but they are never taken during the <lb/>
            dog-days, for then they do not feed, but conceal themselves <lb/>
            and get out of the way. The pigment is contained between <lb/>
            the mecon and the neck. The union of these parts is thick, <lb/>
            and the colour is like a white membrane; this is taken <lb/>
            away. When this is bruised, the pigment wets and stains <lb/>
            the hand. Something resembling a vein passes through it, <lb/>
            and this appears to be the pigment; the nature of the rest <lb/>
            resembles alum.1 The pigment is the worst at the period of <lb/>
            depositing their nidamental capsules.</p>
          <p>5. The small ones are pounded up, shells and all, for <lb/>
            it is not easy to separate them; but they separate the <lb/>
            larger kinds from the shells, and then extract the pig­ <lb/>
            ment. For this purpose the mecon is divided from <lb/>
            the neck, for the pigment lies above the part called the <lb/>
            stomach, and when this is taken away, they are divided <lb/>
            asunder. They are careful to bruise them while alive, for <lb/>
            if they die before they are cut up, they vomit up the pig­ <lb/>
            ment ; for this reason they keep them in the baskets till <lb/>
            a sufficient number is collected, and there is time to procure <lb/>
            the pigment.</p>
          <p>6. The ancients did not let down or fasten any basket-net <lb/>
            to their baits, so that it often happened that the purpura <lb/>
            fell off as they were drawn up ; but at the present time they <note type="footnote">1 Evidently a corrupt reading. </note> <pb n="117"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. V.] </note> <lb/>
            use basket-nets, in order that if the purpura should fall off, <lb/>
            it may not be lost. They are most likely to fall off when <lb/>
            full, but when empty it is difficult to draw them from <lb/>
            the bait. These are the peculiarities of the purpura. The <lb/>
            nature of the ceryx is the same as that of the purpura, and <lb/>
            so are their seasons.</p>
          <p>7. They both have opercula, and so have all turbinated <lb/>
            shell-fish, from the period of their birth. They feed by fore­ <lb/>
            ing out their tongue, as it is called, beneath the operculum : <lb/>
            the purpura has a tongue larger than a finger, with which it <lb/>
            feeds upon and pierces the conchylia, and even the shells of <lb/>
            its own species. Both the purpura and the ceryx are long- <lb/>
            lived, for the purpura lives six years, and its annual increase <lb/>
            is seen in the divisions on the helix of its shell.</p>
          <p>8. The mya also deposits nidamental capsules; those <lb/>
            which are called limnostrea are the first to originate in <lb/>
            muddy places, but the conchae, chemæ, solens, and pectens <lb/>
            find their subsistence in sandy shores; the pinnæ grow up <lb/>
            from their byssus both in sandy and muddy shores. The <lb/>
            pinnæ always contain a pinnophylax, either like a small caris <lb/>
            or cancer, and soon die when this is extracted. On the whole, <lb/>
            all the testacea are produced spontaneously in mud, different <lb/>
            kinds originating in different sorts of mud; the ostrea is <lb/>
            found in mud, the conchae and others that have been men­ <lb/>
            tioned in sand. The tethya, balanus, and others which live <lb/>
            on the surface, as the patella and nerita, originate in holes <lb/>
            in the rocks. All these reach maturity very soon, espe­ <lb/>
            cially the purpuræ and pectens, for they are matured in one <lb/>
            year.</p>
          <p>9. Very small white cancri are produced in some of the <lb/>
            testacea, especially in the myæ that inhabit muddy places, <lb/>
            and next to this in the pinnæ those which are called pinno­ <lb/>
            teræ ; they occur also in the pectens and limnostrea. These <lb/>
            animals apparently never grow ; and the fishermen say that <lb/>
            they are produced at the same time as the creatures they <lb/>
            inhabit. The pectens disappear for some time in the sand, <lb/>
            and so do the purpuræ. The ostrea (bivalves) are produced <lb/>
            in the manner described, for some of them originate in <lb/>
            shallow water, others near the shore, or among rocks, or in <lb/>
            rough hard places, or in sand; and some have the power <lb/>
            of locomotion, others have not. <pb n="118"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. V. </note> </p>
          <p>10. Among those that are not locomotive, the pinnæ are <lb/>
            fixed; the solens and conchæ remain on one spot, though <lb/>
            not fixed, and do not survive separation from their home. <lb/>
            The nature of the aster' is so hot, that if it is captured <lb/>
            immediately after swallowing anything, its food is found <lb/>
            digested; and they say that it is very troublesome in the <lb/>
            Pyrrhæan Euripus. Its form is like the paintings of a <lb/>
            star. The creatures called pneumones are spontaneously <lb/>
            produced. The shell which painters use is very thick, and <lb/>
            the pigment is produced on the outside of the shell; they <lb/>
            are principally found in the neighbourhood of Caria.</p>
          <p>11. The carcinium also originates in earth and mud, and <lb/>
            afterwards makes its way into an empty shell, and when it <lb/>
            grows too large for that, it leaves it for a larger one, as the <lb/>
            shell of the nerita, strombus, and such like; it frequently <lb/>
            occurs in the small ceryx. When it has entered the shell, <lb/>
            it carries it about and lives in it, except that as it grows it <lb/>
            migrates into a larger shell.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XIV.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. THE nature of the testacea is the same as that of crea­ <lb/>
            tures without shells, as the cnidæ2 and sponges, which inha­ <lb/>
            bit the holes in rocks. There are two kinds of cnidæ, some <lb/>
            which live in holes in the rocks, and cannot be separated <lb/>
            from them, and other migrating species which live upon the <lb/>
            smooth flat surface of the rocks. (The patella also is free <lb/>
            and locomotive.) In the interior of the sponges are found <lb/>
            the creatures called pinnophylaces, and the interior is closed <lb/>
            with a net like a spider's web, and small fish are captured <lb/>
            by opening and closing this web, for it opens as they ap­ <lb/>
            proach, and closes upon them when they have entered.</p>
          <p>2. There are three kinds of sponges ; one of them is thin, <lb/>
            the other is thick, and the third, which is called the <lb/>
            Achillean sponge, is slender, compact, and very strong; it <lb/>
            is placed beneath helmets and thigh-pieces, for the sake of <lb/>
            deadening the sound of blows; this kind is very rare. Among <lb/>
            the compact kinds, those which are very hard and rough are <lb/>
            called tragi. They all grow upon the rock or near the <lb/>
            shore, and obtain their food from the mud. This is evident, <lb/>
            for they are full of mud when they are captured. This is <note type="footnote">1 Star-fish. </note><note type="footnote">2 Actinia. </note> <pb n="119"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. V.] </note> <lb/>
            the case with all other fixed things, that they derive their <lb/>
            food from the spot to which they are attached.</p>
          <p>3. The compact species are weaker than those which are <lb/>
            thin, because their point of attachment is smaller. It is <lb/>
            affirmed that the sponge possesses sensation; this is <lb/>
            a proof of it, that it contracts if it perceives any pur­ <lb/>
            pose of tearing it up, and renders the task more difficult. <lb/>
            The sponge does the same thing when the winds and waves <lb/>
            are violent, that it may not lose its point of attachment. <lb/>
            There are some persons who dispute this, as the natives of <lb/>
            Torona. The sponge is inhabited by worms and other living <lb/>
            creatures, which the rock-fish eat when the sponge is torn <lb/>
            up, as well as the remainder of its roots. But if the sponge <lb/>
            is broken off, it grows again, and is completed from the por­ <lb/>
            tion that is left.</p>
          <p>4. The thin sponges are the largest, and they are most <lb/>
            abundant on the Lycian coast; the compact sponges <lb/>
            are softer, and the Achillean are more harsh than the <lb/>
            others. On the whole, those that inhabit deep places with <lb/>
            a mild temperature are the softest, for wind and cold <lb/>
            weather harden them, as they do other growing things, and <lb/>
            stop their increase. For this reason the sponges of the <lb/>
            Hellespont are rough and compact; and, altogether, those <lb/>
            beyond Malea, and those on this side, differ in softness and <lb/>
            hardness.</p>
          <p>5. Neither should the heat be very great, for the sponge be­ <lb/>
            comes rotten, like plants, wherefore those near the shore are <lb/>
            the best, especially if the water is deep near the land, for the <lb/>
            temperature is moderated by the depth. When alive, before <lb/>
            they are washed, they are black. Their point of attach­ <lb/>
            ment is neither single nor dispersed over the whole surface, <lb/>
            for there are empty passages between the points of attach­ <lb/>
            ment. Something like a membrane is extended over their <lb/>
            lower part, and the attachment is by several points; on the <lb/>
            upper part are other closed passages, and four or five which <lb/>
            are apparent. Wherefore some persons say that these are <lb/>
            the organs by which they take their food.</p>
          <p>6. There is also another species called aplysia, because it <lb/>
            cannot be washed. This has very large passages; but the <lb/>
            other parts of the substance are quite compact. When cut <lb/>
            open it is more compact and smooth than the sponge, and <pb n="120"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. V. </note> <lb/>
            the whole is like a lung ; of all the sponges this one is con­ <lb/>
            fessed to have the most sensation, and to be the most <lb/>
            enduring. They are plainly seen in the sea near the sponges, <lb/>
            for the other sponges are white as the mud settles down <lb/>
            upon them, but these are always black. This is the mode <lb/>
            of production in sponges and testacea.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>1. AMONG the malacostraca the carabi are impregnated by <lb/>
            sexual intercourse, and contain their ova during three <lb/>
            months, May, June, and July. They afterwards deposit <lb/>
            them upon the hollow part of their folded tail, and their <lb/>
            ova grow like worms. The same thing takes place in the <lb/>
            malacia and oviparous fish, for their ova always grow.</p>
          <p>2. The ova of the carabi are sandy, and divided into <lb/>
            eight parts ; for a cartilaginous appendage, round which the <lb/>
            ova are attached, is united to each of the opercula at their <lb/>
            junction with the side ; and the whole resembles a bunch of <lb/>
            grapes, for every one of the cartilaginous appendages is fre­ <lb/>
            quently subdivided, and the divisions are apparent to any <lb/>
            one who will separate them, but when first seen they <lb/>
            appear to be united. Those ova which are in the centre <lb/>
            are larger than those which are contiguous to the perforation, <lb/>
            and the last are the least.</p>
          <p>3. The smallest ova are as large as millet; the ova are <lb/>
            not continuous with the perforation, but in the middle. <lb/>
            For two divisions extend on each side, from the tail <lb/>
            and from the thorax, and this is also the line of junction for <lb/>
            the opercula. The ova, which are placed at the side, cannot <lb/>
            be enclosed, unless the extremity of the tail is drawn over <lb/>
            them ; this, however, covers them like a lid.</p>
          <p>4. The female, in depositing her ova, appears to collect <lb/>
            them on the cartilaginous appendages by means of <lb/>
            the broad part of the folded tail. She produces them <lb/>
            by pressing with her tail and bending her body. These <lb/>
            cartilaginous processes at the season of oviposition in­ <lb/>
            crease in size, in order to become appropriate recep­ <lb/>
            tacles for the ova. The ova are deposited on these pro­ <lb/>
            cesses, as those of the sepia are deposited upon broken <lb/>
            pieces of wood or anything floating in the sea. This is the <pb n="121"/>
            <note type="margin"> B.V.] </note> <lb/>
            manner of depositing them; but after they have been <lb/>
            ripened twenty days, they are cast off altogether in a mass, <lb/>
            as they appear when separated from the parent; in fifteen <lb/>
            days, at the outside, the carabi are produced from these ova, <lb/>
            and they are often taken off less than a finger's length. The <lb/>
            ova are produced before Arcturus, and after Arcturus they <lb/>
            are cast off.</p>
          <p>5. The cyphæ among the carides contain their ova about <lb/>
            four months. The carabi are found in rough and rocky places, <lb/>
            the astaci in those that are smooth ; but neither of them <lb/>
            inhabit mud. For this cause the astaci are found in the <lb/>
            Hellespont and near Thasus; the carabi in the neighbour­ <lb/>
            hood of Sigeum and Athos. Fishermen, when they pursue <lb/>
            their calling in the open sea, distinguish the rough and <lb/>
            muddy places by the nature of the shore, and other signs. <lb/>
            In the spring and winter they come near the shore ; in sum­ <lb/>
            mer time they go into deep water, sometimes for the sake of <lb/>
            warmth, and sometimes for the cold.</p>
          <p>6. Those called arcti1 breed nearly at the same time as the <lb/>
            carabi, wherefore they are most excellent in winter and in <lb/>
            spring before the breeding season, and they are worst after <lb/>
            they have deposited their ova. They change their shell in <lb/>
            the spring, like the serpent, which puts off its old age, as it <lb/>
            is called. Both the carabi and the carcini do this when they <lb/>
            are young, as well as afterwards. All the carabi are long- <lb/>
            lived.</p>

          <p>1. THE malacia produce a white ovum after sexual inter­ <lb/>
            course ; in the course of time this becomes sandy, like that <lb/>
            of the testacea. The polypus deposits its ova in holes or <lb/>
            pots, or any other hollow place; the ovum is like bunches of <lb/>
            the wild vine and of the white poplar, as was observed <lb/>
            before ; when the ova are produced they remain suspended <lb/>
            from the hole in which they were deposited: and the ova <lb/>
            are so numerous, that when taken out they will fill a vessel <lb/>
            much larger than the head of the polypus in which they <lb/>
            were contained.</p>
          <p>2. About fifty days afterwards the young polypi burst the <lb/>
            eggs and escape, like phalangia, in great numbers. The par. <lb/>
            ticular shape of each limb is not distinct, though the general <note type="footnote">1 Perhaps, Cancer spinosissimus. </note> <pb n="122"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. V. </note> <lb/>
            form is plain. Many of them perish from their small size <lb/>
            and debility. Some have been observed so small that they <lb/>
            could not be distinguished, unless they were touched, when <lb/>
            they were seen to move.</p>
          <p>3. The sepia also deposits eggs, which resemble large, <lb/>
            black, myrtle seeds. They are united together like a bunch <lb/>
            of fruit, and are enclosed in a substance which prevents <lb/>
            them from separating readily. The male emits his ink <lb/>
            upon them, a mucous fluid, which causes their slippery <lb/>
            appearance. The ova increase in this way; and when first <lb/>
            produced they are white, but when they have touched the <lb/>
            ink they become large and black. When the young sepia, <lb/>
            which is entirely formed of the internal white of the ovum, <lb/>
            is produced, it makes its way out by the rupture of the <lb/>
            membrane of the ovum.</p>
          <p>4. The ovum which the female first produces is like hail, <lb/>
            and to this the young sepia is attached by the head, as birds <lb/>
            are attached to the abdomen. The nature of the umbilical <lb/>
            attachment has never been observed, except that as the sepia <lb/>
            increases the white always becomes less, and at last entirely <lb/>
            disappears, like the yolk of the eggs of birds.</p>
          <p>5. The eyes are at first very large in these as in other <lb/>
            animals, as in the diagram. The ovum is seen at A, the eyes <lb/>
            at B and C, and the embryo sepia itself at D. The female <lb/>
            contains ova during the spring. The ova are produced in <lb/>
            fifteen days; and when the ova are produced they remain <lb/>
            for fifteen days longer like the small seeds of grapes, and <lb/>
            when these are ruptured the young sepias escape from the <lb/>
            inside. If a person divides them before they have reached <lb/>
            maturity, the young sepias emit their fœces and vary in <lb/>
            colour, and turn from white to red from alarm.</p>
          <p>6. The crustaceans incubate upon their ova, which are <lb/>
            placed beneath them; but the polypus and sepia and such <lb/>
            like incubate upon their ova wherever they may be depo­ <lb/>
            sited, and especially the sepia, for the female has often been <lb/>
            observed with her abdomen upon the ground, but the female <lb/>
            polypus has been observed sometimes placed upon her ova, <lb/>
            and sometimes upon her mouth, holding with her tentacula <lb/>
            over the hole in which the ova were deposited. The sepia <lb/>
            deposits her ova upon the ground among fuel and reeds, <lb/>
            or upon any thing thrown in the water, as wood, branches, <pb n="123"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. V.] </note> <lb/>
            or stones; and the fishermen are careful to place branches <lb/>
            of trees in the water. Upon these they deposit their long <lb/>
            and united ova like branches of fruit.</p>
          <p>7. The ova are deposited and produced by repeated <lb/>
            exertion, as if the parturition were accompanied with pain. <lb/>
            The teuthis oviposits in the sea. The ova, like those <lb/>
            of the sepia, are united together. Both the teuthus and <lb/>
            sepia are short-lived, for very few of them survive a year. <lb/>
            The same is the case with the polypus. Each egg produces <lb/>
            one small sepia, and so also in the teuthis. The male teuthus <lb/>
            differs from the female ; for if the hair (branchia) are drawn <lb/>
            aside, the female will be seen to have two red substances <lb/>
            like mammæ, which the male does not possess. The sepia <lb/>
            also has the same sexual distinction, and is more variegated <lb/>
            than the female, as I observed before.</p>

          <p>1. IT has already been observed that the male insects are <lb/>
            less than the female, and that the male mounts upon the <lb/>
            female; and the manner of their sexual intercourse has been <lb/>
            described, and the difficulty of separating them. Most of <lb/>
            them produce their young very soon after sexual intercourse. <lb/>
            All the kinds except some psyche (butterflies and moths) <lb/>
            produce worms. These produce a hard substance, like the <lb/>
            seed of the cnecus,1 which is fluid within. From the worm <lb/>
            an animal is produced, but not from a portion of it, as if it <lb/>
            were an ovum, but the whole grows and becomes an articu­ <lb/>
            lated animal.</p>
          <p>2. Some of them are produced from similar animals, as <lb/>
            phalangia and spiders from phalangia and spiders, and atte­ <lb/>
            labi,2 locusts, and grasshoppers. Others do not originate in <lb/>
            animals of the same species, but their production is sponta­ <lb/>
            neous, for some of them spring from the dew which falls <lb/>
            upon plants. The origin of these is naturally in the spring, <lb/>
            though they often appear in the winter, if fine weather and <lb/>
            south winds occur for any length of time. Some originate <lb/>
            in rotten mud and dung; and others in the fresh wood of <lb/>
            plants or in dry wood; others among the hair of animals, or <lb/>
            in their flesh, or excrements, whether ejected, or still exist­ <lb/>
            ing in the body, as those which are called helminthes. <note type="footnote"> I Cantharus tinctorius, a plant of the thistle kind. L. and S. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The larva of some species. </note> <pb n="124"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin"> [B. V. </note> 3. There are three kinds of these, the flat worms, the <lb/>
            round worms, and those which are called ascarides. From <lb/>
            these creatures nothing is produced ; but the broad worm is <lb/>
            attached to the intestine, and produces something like the <lb/>
            seed of the colocynth, and this is used by physicians as a <lb/>
            proof of the presence of the worm.</p>
          <p>4. Butterflies are produced from caterpillars; and these <lb/>
            originate in the leaves of green plants, especially the rha­ <lb/>
            phahus, which some persons call crambe. At first they are <lb/>
            smaller than millet, afterwards they grow into little worms, <lb/>
            in three days they become small caterpillars, afterwards they <lb/>
            grow and become motionless, and change their form. In <lb/>
            this state the creature is called chrysalis. It has a hard <lb/>
            covering, but moves when it is touched. They are united <lb/>
            to something by weblike processes, and have no mouth nor <lb/>
            any other visible organ. After a short time the covering is <lb/>
            burst, and a winged animal escapes, which is called a but­ <lb/>
            terfly.</p>
          <p>5. At first, while in the caterpillar state, they take food <lb/>
            and evacuate fœces, but in the chrysalis state they do nei­ <lb/>
            ther. The same is the case with all other creatures which <lb/>
            originate in worms, and those which produce worms after <lb/>
            sexual intercourse, or even without this process; for the <lb/>
            offspring of bees, anthrenæ, and wasps, while they are young <lb/>
            worms, consume food and evacuate excrement, but when <lb/>
            from worms they receive their conformation they are called <lb/>
            nymphæ, and neither feed nor evacuate, but remain quiet in <lb/>
            their covering until they are grown. They then make their <lb/>
            escape by cutting through a place where the cell is fastened on.</p>
          <p>6. The penial and hypera2 also are produced from a <lb/>
            kind of campe (caterpillar) which make a wave as they <lb/>
            walk, and as they advance bend the hinder extremity <lb/>
            up to that which has preceded. The creature pro­ <lb/>
            duced always derives its colour from the campe in which <lb/>
            it originates. A certain great worm, which has as it were <lb/>
            horns, and differs from others, at its first metamorphosis <lb/>
            produces a campe, afterwards a bombylius, and lastly <lb/>
            a necydalus. It passes through all these forms in six <lb/>
            months From this animal some women unroll and separate <lb/>
            the bombycina (cocoons), and afterwards weave them. It in <note type="footnote">1 Some species of larva </note><note type="footnote">2 Geometry </note> <pb n="125"/>
            <note type="margin"> B V.] </note> <lb/>
            said that this was first woven in the island of Cos by <lb/>
            Pamphila, the daughter of Plateos.</p>
          <p>7. From the worms in dry wood the insects called carabi <lb/>
            are produced in the same manner; for at first they are im­ <lb/>
            moveable worms, and afterwards the carabi are produced by <lb/>
            the rupture of their case. The crambides originate in the <lb/>
            plant called crambe, and these also have wings, and the <lb/>
            prasocurides from the plant called prasum (onion). The <lb/>
            œstri are produced from the little flat creatures that are <lb/>
            found on the surface of rivers. Wherefore also they con <lb/>
            gregate in the greatest numbers around the waters where <lb/>
            such animals are found. The kind of pygolampis which <lb/>
            has no wings originates in a small, black, hairy caterpillar. <lb/>
            These undergo another change, and turn into the winged <lb/>
            creatures called bostrychi.</p>
          <p>8. The empides originate in ascarides, and the ascarides <lb/>
            originate in the mud of wells and running waters which flow <lb/>
            over an earthy bottom. At first the decaying mud acquires <lb/>
            a white colour, which afterwards becomes black, and finally <lb/>
            red. When this takes place, very small red creatures are <lb/>
            seen growing in it like fuci. At first these move about in a <lb/>
            mass, afterwards their connection is ruptured, the creatures <lb/>
            called ascarides are borne about in the water, after a few <lb/>
            days they stand erect in the water without motion and of a <lb/>
            hard texture, and subsequently the case is broken and the <lb/>
            empis sits upon it until either the sun or the wind enables <lb/>
            it to move, then it flies away.</p>
          <p>9. The commencement of life in all other worms, and in <lb/>
            all creatures produced from worms, originates in the influ­ <lb/>
            ence of the sun and wind. The ascarides are produced in <lb/>
            greater numbers, and more quickly, where the various <lb/>
            matters are mixed together, as in the works conducted in <lb/>
            the Megarian territory, for putrefaction thus takes place <lb/>
            more readily. The autumnal season also is favourable to <lb/>
            their increase, for there is less moisture at that time of the <lb/>
            year. The crotones1 originate in the agrostis, the melo­ <lb/>
            lonthæ from the worms which originate in the dung of oxen <lb/>
            and asses.</p>
          <p>10. The canthari which roll up dung, hide themselves in <lb/>
            it during the winter, and produce worms, which afterwards <note type="footnote">1 Ticks. Acarus ricinus. </note> <pb n="126"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. V. </note> <lb/>
            become canthari; and from the worms which inhabit the <lb/>
            osprea,1 winged creatures, like those already mentioned, <lb/>
            derive their existence. Flies originate in dung which has <lb/>
            been set apart, and those who are employed in this work <lb/>
            strive to separate the remainder which is mixed together, <lb/>
            for they say that the dung is thus brought to putrefac­ <lb/>
            tion.</p>
          <p>11. The origin of these worms is very small; for first of <lb/>
            all a redness is perceived, and motion commences, as if they <lb/>
            were united together. The worm then again becomes still, <lb/>
            afterwards it moves, and then again is immoveable. From <lb/>
            this the worm is completed, and motion recommences under <lb/>
            the action of the sun and wind. The myops is produced in <lb/>
            wood. The orsodacnæ2 from the metamorphosis of worms, <lb/>
            which originate on the stalks of the crambe. The cantharis <lb/>
            from worms which dwell on the fig tree, apium (pear tree), <lb/>
            and pitch tree, for there are worms on all these, and on the <lb/>
            cynacantha.3 They assemble round strong smelling things <lb/>
            because they originate from them.</p>
          <p>12. The conops springs from aworm which originates in the <lb/>
            thick part of vinegar; for there seem also to be worms in things <lb/>
            which are the farthest from putrefaction, as in snow which has <lb/>
            laid for some time: for after having laid, it becomes red, <lb/>
            wherefore, also, the worms are such and hairy. Those in the <lb/>
            snow in Media are large and white, and furnished with but <lb/>
            little power of motion. In Cyprus, when the manufacturers <lb/>
            of the stone called chalcitis burn it for many days in the <lb/>
            fire, a winged creature, something larger than a great fly, <lb/>
            is seen walking and leaping in the fire.</p>
          <p>13. The worms perish when they are taken out of the <lb/>
            snow, and so do these creatures when taken from the fire. <lb/>
            And the salamander shews that it is possible for some <lb/>
            animal substances to exist in the fire, for they say that fire <lb/>
            is extinguished when this animal walks over it.</p>
          <p>14. In the river Hypanis in the Cimmerian Bosphorus, <lb/>
            about the summer solstice, capsules larger than grape-seed <lb/>
            are floated down the river: when these are ruptured, a <lb/>
            four-footed, winged creature makes its escape, which lives <lb/>
            and flies about till the evening. As the sun descends, it <note type="footnote">1 Vetches, leguminous plants. </note><note type="footnote">2 Chrysomela olcracea. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Perhaps the dog rose, or sweet briar. </note> <pb n="127"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. V.] </note> <lb/>
            becomes emaciated, and is dead by sunset, having lived but <lb/>
            one day; for which cause it is called ephemerum. Most <lb/>
            animals which spring from caterpillars or worms, are first of <lb/>
            all enclosed in a web, and this is their nature.</p>
          <p>15. The wasps which are called ichneumons, which are <lb/>
            smaller than the others, kill the phalangia, and carry them <lb/>
            to a wall, or some other place with a hole in it; and when <lb/>
            they have covered them over with mud, they oviposit there, <lb/>
            and the ichneumon wasps are produced from them. Many <lb/>
            of the coleoptera, and other small and anonymous creatures <lb/>
            make little holes in tombs or walls, and there deposit their <lb/>
            worms.</p>
          <p>16. The period of reproduction, from its commencement <lb/>
            to its conclusion, is generally completed in three or four <lb/>
            weeks. In the worms and worm-like creatures, three weeks <lb/>
            are usually sufficient, and four weeks are usually enough <lb/>
            for those which are oviparous. In one week from their <lb/>
            sexual intercourse, the growth of the ovum is completed. <lb/>
            In the remaining three weeks, those that produce by gene­ <lb/>
            ration, hatch and bring forth their ova, as in the spiders, <lb/>
            and such like creatures. The metamorphoses generally <lb/>
            occupy three or four days, like the crisis of diseases. This <lb/>
            is the mode of generation in insects.</p>
          <p>17. They die from the shrivelling of their limbs, as large <lb/>
            animals do of old age. Those which are furnished with <lb/>
            wings have these organs drawn together in autumn. The <lb/>
            myopes die from an effusion of water in their eyes.</p>

          <p>1. ALL persons are not agreed as to the generation of bees, <lb/>
            for some say that they neither produce young, nor have <lb/>
            sexual intercourse; but that they bring their young from <lb/>
            other sources; and some say that they collect them from <lb/>
            the flowers of the calyntrus,1 and others from the flower of <lb/>
            the calamus.2 Others again, say that they are found in the <lb/>
            flowers of the olive, and produce this proof, that the swarms <lb/>
            are most abundant when the olives are fertile. Other per­ <lb/>
            sons affirm that they collect the young of the drones from <lb/>
            any of the substances we have named, but that the rulers <lb/>
            (queens) produce the young of the bees. <note type="footnote"> 1 Honeysuckle. </note><note type="footnote">2 Reed. </note> <pb n="128"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin"> [B. V. </note> 2. There are two kinds of rulers, the best of these is red, <lb/>
            the other black and variegated: their size is double that of <lb/>
            the working bees ; the part of the body beneath the cincture <lb/>
            is more than half of the whole length: by some they are <lb/>
            called the mother bees, as if they were the parents of the <lb/>
            rest; and they argue, that unless the ruler is present, <lb/>
            drones only are produced, and no bees. Others affirm that <lb/>
            they have sexual intercourse, and that the drones are males, <lb/>
            and the bees females.</p>
          <p>3. The other bees originate in the cells of the comb, but <lb/>
            the rulers are produced in the lower part of the comb, six or <lb/>
            seven of them separated, opposite to the rest of the pro­ <lb/>
            geny. The bees have a sting, which the drones have not: <lb/>
            the kings and rulers have a sting which they do not make <lb/>
            use of, and some persons suppose that they have none.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XIX.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. THERE are several kinds of bees, the best are small, round, <lb/>
            and variegated : another kind is large, like the anthrene : a <lb/>
            third kind is called phor; this is black, and has a broad <lb/>
            abdomen : the drone is the fourth, and is the largest of all; <lb/>
            it has no sting, and is incapable of work, for which reason <lb/>
            people often wrap something round their hives, so that the <lb/>
            bees can enter, but the drones, being larger, cannot.</p>
          <p>2. There are two kinds of rulers among bees, as I observed <lb/>
            before. In every hive there are several rulers, and not a <lb/>
            single one, for the hive perishes if there are not rulers <lb/>
            enough (not that they thus become anarchical, but, as they <lb/>
            say, because they are required for breeding the bees) ; if <lb/>
            there are too many rulers they perish, for thus they become <lb/>
            distracted.</p>
          <p>3. If the spring is late, and drought and rusts are about, <lb/>
            the progeny is small. When the weather is dry, they make <lb/>
            honey. When it is damp, their progeny multiplies ; for <lb/>
            which reason, the olives and the swarms of bees multiply at <lb/>
            the same time. They begin by making comb, in which they <lb/>
            place the progeny, which is deposited with their mouths, as <lb/>
            those say who affirm that they collect it from external <lb/>
            sources. Afterwards they gather the honey wh'ch is to be <lb/>
            their food, during the summer and the autumn ; that which <lb/>
            is gathered in the autumn is the best. <pb n="129"/>

            of wax from the droppings of trees, but the honey falls from <lb/>
            the air, principally about the rising of the stars, and when <lb/>
            the rainbow rests upon the earth. Generally no honey is <lb/>
            produced before the rising of the Pleiades. We argue that <lb/>
            wax is made, as I said, from flowers, but that the bees do <lb/>
            not make honey, but simply collect that which falls ; for <lb/>
            those who keep bees find the cells filled with honey in the <lb/>
            course of one or two days. In the autumn there are <lb/>
            flowers enough, but the bees make no honey, if that which <lb/>
            they have produced is taken away. But if one supply was <lb/>
            taken away, and they were in want of food, they would <lb/>
            make more if they procured it from flowers.</p>
          <p>5. The honey becomes thick by ripening, for at first it is <lb/>
            like water, and continues liquid for some days, wherefore it <lb/>
            never becomes thick if it is taken away during that time. <lb/>
            It requires twenty days to make it consistent; this is very <lb/>
            plain from the taste of it, for it differs both in sweetness <lb/>
            and solidity. The bee carries honey from every plant <lb/>
            which has cup-shaped flowers, and from all those which <lb/>
            contain a sweet principle, but does not injure the fruit; it <lb/>
            takes up and carries away the sweet taste of plants with <lb/>
            its tongue-like organ.</p>
          <p>6. The honey-comb is pressed when the wild figs begin <lb/>
            to appear; and they produce the best grubs when they <lb/>
            can produce honey. The bees carry the wax and bee­ <lb/>
            bread upon their legs, but the honey is disgorged into <lb/>
            the cells. After the progeny is deposited in the cells, <lb/>
            they incubate like birds. In the wax cells the little worm <lb/>
            is placed at the side; afterwards it rises of itself to be fed. <lb/>
            It is united to the comb in such a manner as to be held <lb/>
            by it. The progeny both of the bees and drones from <lb/>
            which the little worms are produced, is white. As they <lb/>
            grow they become bees and drones. The progeny of the <lb/>
            king-bees is rather red, and about the consistency of thick <lb/>
            honey. In bulk it is as large as the creature which is pro­ <lb/>
            duced from it. The progeny of the king-bee is not a worm, <lb/>
            but comes forth a perfect bee, as they say; and, when the <lb/>
            progeny is produced in the comb, honey is found in that <lb/>
            which is opposite. <note type="footnote"> K </note> <pb n="130"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin"> [B. V. </note> 7. After the grub is covered up, it has wings and <lb/>
            feet;; and when it has acquired wings, it bursts through <lb/>
            the membrane, and flies away. It evacuates an excremen­ <lb/>
            titious matter while it is a worm, but not afterwards, until <lb/>
            it is perfected, as I observed before. If a person cuts off <lb/>
            the head of the grub before its wings are acquired, the <lb/>
            other bees devour it; if a person having cut off the wings <lb/>
            of a drone lets it go, the bees will eat off the wings of the <lb/>
            other drones.</p>
          <p>8. The bee will live for six years, some have lived for <lb/>
            seven, and if a swarm lasts nine or ten years, it is con­ <lb/>
            sidered to have done well. In Pontus there are very white <lb/>
            bees, which make honey twice every month. In Thernis­ <lb/>
            cyra, near the river Thermodon, are found bees which make <lb/>
            cells in the earth, and in hives with a very small quantity <lb/>
            of wax, but their honey is thick. The cells are smooth <lb/>
            and homogeneous. They only do this in the winter, and <lb/>
            not all the year round; for there is a great deal of ivy in <lb/>
            the place, which flowers at this season of the year, and from <lb/>
            this they carry away the honey. From the higher regions <lb/>
            of Amisus a kind of white honey is procured, which the <lb/>
            bees form upon the trees without wax. The same is also <lb/>
            found in another place in Pontus. There are also bees <lb/>
            which form triple cells in the earth ; these form honey, but <lb/>
            never have grubs. All such as these, however, are not cells, <lb/>
            neither are they formed by every kind of bee.</p>

          <p>1. THE anthrenæ1 and wasps form cells for their progeny <lb/>
            when they have no rulers, but are wandering about in <lb/>
            search of them, the anthrenæ upon some high place, the <lb/>
            wasps in holes. But when they have the rulers they form <lb/>
            their cells underground. All their cells are hexagonal, like <lb/>
            those of bees; they are not formed of wax, but of a web­ <lb/>
            like membrane, made of the bark of trees. The cells of <lb/>
            the anthrenæ are far more elegant than those of wasps. <lb/>
            Upon the side of their cells they place their progeny, in the <lb/>
            manner of the bees, like a drop of liquid united to the wall <lb/>
            of the cell. The progeny in all the cells is not alike, but in <lb/>
            some they are so large as to be almost ready for flight, in <lb/>
            others are nymphæ, in others grubs. <note type="footnote"> 1 Hornet, Apis terrestris. </note> <pb n="131"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin"> B. V.] </note> 2. The only excrementitious matter is found in the cells <lb/>
            of the grubs, as in the case of bees. As long as they are <lb/>
            nymphæ they remain motionless, and the cell is sealed over, <lb/>
            and on the other side of the cell which contains their pro­ <lb/>
            geny, there is a drop of honey in the combs of the anthrenæ. <lb/>
            The grubs of these creatures are produced in the autumn, <lb/>
            not in the spring, but they evidently grow most rapidly at <lb/>
            the full moon. The progeny and the grubs are not united <lb/>
            to the bottom, but to the side of the cell.</p>

          <p>1. SOME of the bombycia1 form an angular cell of mud, <lb/>
            which they attach to a stone or something else, and smear <lb/>
            with a kind of transparent substance; this is so very thick and <lb/>
            hard, that it can scarcely be broken with the blow of a spear. <lb/>
            In this they deposit their ova, and the white maggots are <lb/>
            contained in a black membrane; and wax is formed in the <lb/>
            mud without any membrane, this wax is much more yellow <lb/>
            than that of bees.</p>
          <p>2. The ants also have sexual intercourse, and produce <lb/>
            maggots which they do not attach to anything. As these <lb/>
            grow, they change from small round things to long articu­ <lb/>
            lated beings. The season for their production is in the <lb/>
            spring.</p>
          <p>3. The land-scorpions also bring forth many egg-like <lb/>
            maggots, upon which they incubate. When the young <lb/>
            ones are perfect, they drive out and destroy their parents <lb/>
            like spiders, for they are frequently eleven in number.</p>

          <p>1. THE arachnia copulate in the manner already described, <lb/>
            and produce maggots which at first are small. After their <lb/>
            metamorphosis they become spiders, not from a part but <lb/>
            from the whole of the maggot, for they are round from the <lb/>
            first. When the female has produced her ova, she in­ <lb/>
            cubates upon them, in three days they acquire limbs. All <lb/>
            of them produce their young in a web, which is thin and <lb/>
            small in some species, but compact in others. Some are <lb/>
            enclosed entirely in a round receptacle, and others are only <lb/>
            partially covered by the web. All the young spiders are <note type="footnote"> 1 Apis cementaria. </note> <note type="footnote"> K 2 </note> <pb n="132"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. V. </note> <lb/>
            not produced at once, but as soon as they are hatched they <lb/>
            leap out and shoot forth a web. If they are bruised <lb/>
            they are found to contain a thick white fluid like that of <lb/>
            maggots.</p>
          <p>2. The field-spiders first of all deposit their ova in a web, <lb/>
            of which one half is attached to themselves, and the other <lb/>
            external, they incubate upon this, and produce their <lb/>
            young alive. The phalangia deposit their ova in a thick <lb/>
            basket which they weave, upon this they incubate. The <lb/>
            smooth kinds produce a small number, the pbalangia a great <lb/>
            many. When they are grown, they surround their parent <lb/>
            in a circle, kill and throw her out. They often seize the <lb/>
            male in the same way if they can catch him, for he assists <lb/>
            the female in incubation. Sometimes there are as many as <lb/>
            three hundred round a single phalangium. The little <lb/>
            spiders become full-grown in about four weeks.</p>

          <p>1. LOCUSTS copulate in the same manner as all other in. <lb/>
            sects, the smaller mounting upon the larger, for the male <lb/>
            is the smaller. They oviposit by fixing the organ which is <lb/>
            attached to their tail ( the ovipositor) in the ground. The <lb/>
            males do not possess this organ. Many of them deposit <lb/>
            their ova in one spot, so as to make it appear like a honey- <lb/>
            comb. As soon as they have deposited their ova, egg-like <lb/>
            maggots are formed, which are covered with a thin coating <lb/>
            of earth like a membrane, and in this they are matured.</p>
          <p>2. The young are so soft as to collapse if they are only <lb/>
            touched. They are not produced on the surface, but a <lb/>
            little below the surface of the soil; and as soon as they <lb/>
            are matured, they escape from the coat of soil in which <lb/>
            they are enclosed as small black locusts. Their skin is <lb/>
            subsequently ruptured, and they then attain their full size. <lb/>
            They produce their young at the end of summer, and then <lb/>
            die.</p>
          <p>3. For as soon as they have deposited their ova, small <lb/>
            worms make their appearance on their necks, the males also <lb/>
            perish at the same time: they come out of the earth in the <lb/>
            spring. Locusts never shew themselves in mountainous <lb/>
            countries, nor in poor land, but in plains, and broken soil, <lb/>
            for they deposit their ova in fissures. The ova remain in <pb n="133"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. V.] </note> <lb/>
            the soil during the winter, and in the summer the locusts <lb/>
            are produced from the germs of the preceding year.</p>
          <p>4. The young of the attelabi are produced in the same <lb/>
            manner, and the parents die after having deposited their <lb/>
            ova. Their ova are destroyed by the rains of the autumn, <lb/>
            if the weather is wet; but if that season is dry, many atte­ <lb/>
            labi are produced, because they are not equally destroyed; <lb/>
            for their destruction appears to be irregular, and to take <lb/>
            place by accident.</p>

          <p>1. THERE are two kinds of grasshoppers: some are small. <lb/>
            These are the first to appear, the last to perish. Others, <lb/>
            which chirp, are large: these appear last, and disappear <lb/>
            first. There is another difference between the small and <lb/>
            large kind. Those which chirp have a division in the middle <lb/>
            of the body : those which do not chirp have none. The large <lb/>
            ones, which chirp, are called achetæ; the small are called <lb/>
            tettigonia. Such of these as are divided, sing a little.</p>
          <p>2. Grasshoppers do not appear where there are no trees, for <lb/>
            which reason they are unknown in the open country of <lb/>
            Cyrene, but are abundant near the city, and especially <lb/>
            among olive trees, for these do not give much shade, and <lb/>
            grasshoppers are not produced in the cold, nor in very shady <lb/>
            groves. Both the large and small ones have sexual inter­ <lb/>
            course with their own kind, copulating with each other on <lb/>
            their backs. The male inserts his organ into the female, in <lb/>
            the same manner as other insects. The female has a divided <lb/>
            pudendum. The female individual is the one which receives <lb/>
            the male.</p>
          <p>3. They deposit their ova in fields, piercing the soil with <lb/>
            the organ at the extremity of their body, like the attelabi; <lb/>
            for the attelabi also oviposit in the fields, for which reason <lb/>
            they are common in Cyrene. They oviposit also in the <lb/>
            reeds which are used to support the vines; these they <lb/>
            pierce: and so they do in the stems of the scilla. The <lb/>
            young ones are washed into the earth, and are common in <lb/>
            rainy weather. The maggot, when it is grown in the earth, <lb/>
            becomes a tettigometra: these are sweetest before they <lb/>
            have ruptured their covering.</p>
          <p>4. And when the season arrives for their appearance, <pb n="134"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. V. </note> <lb/>
            about the solstice, they come forth by night, and immedi. <lb/>
            ately burst their envelope, and the tettigometra becomes a <lb/>
            grasshopper. They immediately become black and hard, <lb/>
            acquire their full size, and begin to chirp. In both kinds <lb/>
            the males chirp; the others, which do not chirp, are females. <lb/>
            When first produced the males are the sweetest: after the <lb/>
            sexual intercourse, the females are sweetest, for they contain <lb/>
            white ova.</p>
          <p>5. If a noise is made as they fly along, they emit a fluid <lb/>
            like water, which the agriculturists describe as if they emitted <lb/>
            both a liquid and solid excrement, and that they feed on dew ; <lb/>
            and if any one approaches them with a bent finger, which <lb/>
            is gradually straightened, they will remain more quiet than <lb/>
            if it is put out straight at once, and will climb up upon the <lb/>
            finger; for, from the dimness of their sight, they climb upon <lb/>
            it as if it were a moving leaf.</p>

          <p>1. THOSE insects which are not carnivorous, but live upon <lb/>
            the juices of living flesh, as lice, fleas, and bugs, produce <lb/>
            nits from sexual intercourse; from these nits nothing else <lb/>
            is formed. Of these insects the fleas originate in very small <lb/>
            portions of corrupted matter, for they are always collected <lb/>
            together where there is any dry dung. Bugs1 proceed from the <lb/>
            moisture which collects on the bodies of animals: lice from <lb/>
            the flesh of other creatures; for before they appear, they <lb/>
            exist in little pimples which do not contain matter: and if <lb/>
            these are pricked, the lice2 escape from them. Some persons <lb/>
            have been afflicted with a disease arising from excessive <lb/>
            moisture in the body, of which people have died, as they say <lb/>
            that Alcmon the poet, and Pherecydes of Syria did.</p>
          <p>2. And in some diseases lice are very common. There is <lb/>
            a kind of lice, which they call wild, and are harder than the <lb/>
            common sort, which are difficult to eradicate from the body. <lb/>
            The heads of children are most subject to be infested <lb/>
            with lice, and men the least so, for women are more liable <lb/>
            to them than men. Those that have lice in the head are <lb/>
            less subject to headache. Many other animals are infested <lb/>
            with lice: for both birds have them, and those which are <lb/>
            called phasiani, unless they dust themselves, are destroyed by <note type="footnote">1 Cinex lectularius. </note><note type="footnote">2 Perhaps Acarus Scabiei, Itch insect. </note> <pb n="135"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. V.] </note> <lb/>
            them. And so are all those creatures which have feathers <lb/>
            with a hollow stem, and those which have hair, except the <lb/>
            ass, which has neither lice nor ticks. Oxen have both; <lb/>
            sheep and goats have ticks, but no lice; hogs are infested <lb/>
            with large, hard lice, and dogs with those which are called <lb/>
            cynoraïstæ. All lice originate in the animals that are in­ <lb/>
            fested with them. All creatures that have lice, and wash <lb/>
            themselves, are more liable to them when they change the <lb/>
            water in which they bathe.</p>
          <p>3. In the sea is a kind of lice1 growing on fish ; but these <lb/>
            do not originate in the fish, but in the mud. Their ap­ <lb/>
            pearance is that of wood-lice with many feet, except that <lb/>
            they have a wide tail. There is one species of marine lice <lb/>
            which occur everywhere, and especially infest the trigla. <lb/>
            All these creatures are furnished with many legs, are ex­ <lb/>
            sanguineous, and insects. The œstrus2 of the thynnus occurs <lb/>
            near the fins: in shape it is like a scorpion, and as large as <lb/>
            a spider. In the sea between Cyrene and Egypt, there is a <lb/>
            fish called the phtheira, which accompanies the dolphin; it <lb/>
            is the fattest of all fish, because it enjoys an abundance of <lb/>
            the food which the dolphin hunts for.</p>

          <p>1 THERE are also other minute animals, as I observed be­ <lb/>
            fore, some of which occur in wool, and in woollen goods; as <lb/>
            the moths, which are produced in the greatest abundance <lb/>
            when the wool is dusty, and especially if a spider is enclosed <lb/>
            with them, for this creature is thirsty, and dries up any <lb/>
            fluid which may be present. This worm also occurs in gar­ <lb/>
            ments. There is one which occurs in old honeycombs, like <lb/>
            the creature which inhabits dry wood: this appears to be <lb/>
            the least of all creatures, it is called acari, it is white <lb/>
            and small. Others also are found in books, some of which <lb/>
            are like those which occur in garments: others are like <lb/>

          <p><note type="margin"> B. V.] </note> 2, There is a little worm which is called xylophthorus,1 <lb/>
            which is no less extraordinary than these animals ; for its <lb/>
            variegated head is projected beyond its case, and its feet are <lb/>
            at the extremity, as in other worms. The rest of the body <lb/>
            is contained in a case made of a substance like spider's web, <lb/>
            and a dry material on the outside of this ; so that it appears <lb/>
            to walk about with this attached to it. These creatures are <lb/>
            attached to their case, and as a snail to its shell, so the <lb/>
            whole of the case is joined to the worm, and it does not fall <lb/>
            out of it, but is drawn out of it, as if they were joined toge­ <lb/>
            ther. If a person pulls off the case, the creature dies, and <lb/>
            becomes as helpless as a snail without its shell. As time <lb/>
            advances, this grub becomes a chrysalis, like a caterpillar, <lb/>
            and lies without motion: but the nature of the winged <lb/>
            creature that is produced has never been ascertained.</p>
          <p>3. The wild figs upon the fig-trees contain a creature <lb/>
            called psen ;2 this is at first a little worm, and afterwards <lb/>
            having ruptured the case, the psen flies out, and leaves it <lb/>
            behind. It then pierces the unripe figs, and causes them <lb/>
            not to fall off, wherefore gardeners place wild fruit near the <lb/>
            cultivated kinds, and plant the wild and cultivated plants <lb/>
            near each other.</p>

          <p>1. THE sexual intercourse of sanguineous and oviparous <lb/>
            quadrupeds takes place in the spring. They do not, how­ <lb/>
            ever, all copulate at the same season; but some in the spring, <lb/>
            others in the summer or autumn, as the season is appropriate <lb/>
            # for bringing up the young of each species. The tortoise pro­ <lb/>
            duces hard, two-coloured eggs, like those of birds. Having <lb/>
            deposited her eggs, she buries them, and makes a beaten <lb/>
            place above them. When this is done, she sits upon them. <lb/>
            The eggs are hatched the following year. The emys goes <lb/>
            out of the water to deposit her eggs, and digs a hole like a <lb/>
            cask, in which she places her eggs and leaves them. Having <lb/>
            left them alone for less than thirty days, she digs them up <lb/>
            again and hatches them and leads them at once to the water. <note type="footnote"> 1 Tinea graminella, Tinea lichenella, Tinea Xylophorus, or perhaps <lb/>

            The marine turtles deposit their eggs in the earth like do­ <lb/>
            mestic birds, and cover them up with earth and sit upon them <lb/>
            during the night. They produce a great many eggs, as many <lb/>
            as an hundred.</p>
          <p>. 2. The saurians and both the land and river crocodiles <lb/>
            produce their eggs upon the land. Those of the lizards are <lb/>
            hatched spontaneously in the earth ; for the lizard does not <lb/>
            live a whole year, for it is said to live only six months. The <lb/>
            river crocodile produces as many as sixty eggs, which are <lb/>
            white. She sits upon them for sixty days, for they live a long <lb/>
            while. A very large animal is produced from these small <lb/>
            eggs; for the egg is not larger than that of a goose, and the <lb/>
            young is in proportion, but when full grown the creature <lb/>
            measures seventeen cubits. Some persons say that it grows <lb/>
            as long as it lives.</p>

          <p>AMONG serpents the viper is externally viviparous, but first <lb/>
            of all internally oviparous. The ovum, like that of fish, is <lb/>
            of one colour and soft skinned. The young are produced <lb/>
            in the upper part. They are not enclosed in a shelly covering, <lb/>
            neither are the ova of fish. The little vipers are produced in <lb/>
            a membrane, which they rupture on the third day, and some­ <lb/>
            times they make their escape by eating their way through <lb/>
            the mother. They are produced one by one in the course <lb/>
            of a day, and their number often exceeds twenty. Other <lb/>
            serpents are externally oviparous, but their ova are joined <lb/>
            together like women's necklaces. When the female deposits <lb/>
            her eggs in the soil, she incubates upon them. These also <lb/>
            are hatched in the second year. This is the manner of the <lb/>
            production of serpents, insects, and of oviparous quadrupeds. <pb n="138"/>

          <p>1. THE above describes the manner of reproduction in ser­ <lb/>
            pents, insects, and oviparous quadrupeds. All birds are <lb/>
            oviparous, but the season of sexual intercourse and of bring­ <lb/>
            ing out their young is not the same in all; for some copu­ <lb/>
            , late and produce eggs at all seasons, as we may say, as the <lb/>
            domestic fowl and the pigeon, for the domestic fowl lays <lb/>
            eggs all the year round, except two months at the winter <lb/>
            solstice. Some of the finest birds will lay sixty eggs before <lb/>
            they want to sit, though these are not so fruitful as the <lb/>
            more common kinds. The Adrianic fowls are very small, <lb/>
            but they lay every day; but they are cruel, and often kill <lb/>
            their chickens. Their colour is variegated. Some of the <lb/>
            domestic birds lay twice a-day, and some have been known <lb/>
            to lay so many eggs that they died very soon.</p>
          <p>2. The domestic fowls, as I said, lay continually ; but the <lb/>
            pigeon, dove, trygon, and cenas lay twice a-year; and the <lb/>
            pigeon ten times. The greatest number of birds lay in the <lb/>
            spring; and some of them produce many young, and this in <lb/>
            two ways; some producing their young often, as the pigeon; <lb/>
            others producing many at a time, as the domestic fowl. All <lb/>
            birds with crooked claws, except the cenchris,1 lay but few <lb/>
            eggs. This bird lays the most of any of its class; for it has <lb/>
            been observed to produce four, and it even produces more. <lb/>
            Some birds lay their eggs in nests; but those that do not <lb/>
            fly, as partridges and quails, do not make nests, but lay their <lb/>
            eggs on the ground and cover them over with rubbish. The <lb/>
            lark and tetrix 2 do the same.</p>
          <p>3. These birds make their nests in a place sheltered from <lb/>
            the wind. That which the Beotians call ærops3 is the <lb/>
            only bird that makes its nests in caverns in the earth. <lb/>
            The cichlæ4 make nests of mud like swallows in the tops of <lb/>
            trees; but they place them in order close to each other, so <note type="footnote">1 Falco tinnunculus. </note><note type="footnote">2 Tetrao tetrix or Otis tetrix. </note><note type="footnote"> s Merops apiaster. </note><note type="footnote">* Turdus, thrush. </note> <pb n="139"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. VI.] </note> <lb/>
            that from their proximity they look like a chain of nests. <lb/>
            Among the birds which make solitary nests, the hoopoe <lb/>
            makes no real nest, but lays its eggs in the stumps of hollow <lb/>
            trees, without building at all. The coccyx1 lays its eggs in <lb/>
            houses and holes in rocks. The tetrix, which the Athenians <lb/>
            call " urax," makes no nest on the ground or in trees, but <lb/>
            in herbaceous plants.</p>

          <p>1. THE eggs of all birds are alike and have a hard shell, if <lb/>
            they are produced by sexual intercourse and are not decayed, <lb/>
            for domestic fowls sometimes lay soft eggs. Birds' eggs are <lb/>
            two-coloured, externally white, internally yellow. The eggs <lb/>
            of birds inhabiting the sides of streams and lakes differ from <lb/>
            those living on dry land, for in the eggs of aquatic birds the <lb/>
            yolk bears a much larger proportion to the white.</p>
          <p>2. The colours of eggs vary in different kinds of birds. <lb/>
            Some have white eggs, as pigeons, partridges; some yellow, <lb/>
            as those inhabiting streams ; others are spotted, as those of <lb/>
            the meleagris2 and phasianus;3 the eggs of the cenchris are red <lb/>
            like vermilion. In the egg itself there is a difference; for <lb/>
            one end is pointed, the other round. The round end is pro­ <lb/>
            duced first. The large, sharp eggs are males; those which <lb/>
            are round and circular at the sharp end are females.</p>
          <p>3. They are matured by incubation. Some are hatched <lb/>
            spontaneously in the earth, as in Egypt, being buried in <lb/>
            dung; and they say that in Syracuse a drunkard placed eggs <lb/>
            beneath his mat, and drank without ceasing until the eggs <lb/>
            were hatched; and eggs placed in warm vessels have been <lb/>
            matured and hatched spontaneously.</p>
          <p>4. The seminal fluid of all birds is white, like that of <lb/>
            other animals; and when they copulate the female receives <lb/>
            the male semen near the diaphragm. The egg at first appears <lb/>
            small and white, afterwards red and bloody; as it grows it be­ <lb/>
            comes quite ochreous and yellow; when it becomes larger a <lb/>
            distinction is made, and the internal part becomes yellow, <lb/>
            the external white; and when it is perfected it is set at <lb/>
            liberty, and excluded just at the period when it is changing <lb/>
            from soft to hard. So that during exclusion it is not har <note type="footnote"> .1 Cuculus canorus. </note><note type="footnote">2 Numida Meleagris. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Phasianus colchicus. </note><pb n="140"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. VI. </note> <lb/>
            dened; but as soon as it is excluded it thickens and becomes <lb/>
            hard, unless it is diseased. And eggs have been known to <lb/>
            be excluded in the state in which all eggs are at a certain <lb/>
            period of their growth; for they were entirely yellow, as the <lb/>
            young bird is afterwards. Such have also been observed in the <lb/>
            domestic fowl beneath the diaphragm, where the eggs of the <lb/>
            hen are placed, entirely yellow, and as large as eggs usually <lb/>
            are. This has been considered ominous.</p>
          <p>5. They are mistaken who say that the hypenemia (barren <lb/>
            eggs) are the remains of former acts of sexual intercourse; <lb/>
            for young birds, as fowls and geese, have been frequently <lb/>
            observed to lay such eggs without any sexual intercourse. <lb/>
            Barren eggs are smaller, not so sweet, and more fluid than <lb/>
            fertile eggs, and they are more numerous. If they are placed <lb/>
            under a bird, the fluid part never thickens, but both the <lb/>
            yolk and the white remain in their original state. Many <lb/>
            birds produce these eggs, as the domestic fowl, partridge, <lb/>
            pigeon, peafowl, goose, and chenalopex.1</p>
          <p>6. Eggs are hatched more readily in summer than in <lb/>
            winter; for in the summer the domestic fowl will hatch in <lb/>
            eighteen days, but in winter sometimes in not less than <lb/>
            twenty-five days. Some birds also are more adapted for <lb/>
            incubation than others. A thunder-storm during the season <lb/>
            of incubation will destroy the eggs. What are called cyno­ <lb/>
            sura and uria (addled eggs) are more frequently produced <lb/>
            in the summer. The hypenemia2 are by some persons called <lb/>
            zephyria, because they say that birds receive these winds in <lb/>
            the spring. They do the same thing if they are touched <lb/>
            with the hand. The hypenemia become fertile; and eggs <lb/>
            that are produced by sexual intercourse are changed to an­ <lb/>
            other kind, if the ben which contains either hypenemia or <lb/>
            fertile eggs has sexual intercourse with another bird before <lb/>
            the eggs begin to change from yellow to white, and the <lb/>
            hypenemia become fertile, and the fertile eggs produce birds <lb/>
            of the nature of the second male.</p>
          <p>7. But if the change from yellow to white has already <lb/>
            taken place, neither the barren nor the fertile eggs are al­ <lb/>
            tered, so as to change to the nature of the second male. And if <lb/>
            the sexual intercourse should be discontinued while the eggs <lb/>
            are small, those which existed previously undergo no change, <note type="footnote">1 <unclear>Enas</unclear> tadorna. </note><note type="footnote">2 Eggs formed without sexual intercourse. </note><pb n="141"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. VI.] </note><unclear/><lb/>
            out if the act is repeated, a rapid increase in size takes place. <lb/>
            The nature of the white and yolk of the egg is different, not <lb/>
            only in colour, but in other properties, for the yolk coagu­ <lb/>
            lates with cold, while the white remains fluid, but the white <lb/>
            coagulates with heat, which the yolk does not, but remains <lb/>
            soft, if it is not burnt; and it becomes consistent and dry <lb/>
            by boiling rather than roasting.</p>
          <p>8. The white and yolk are separated from each other by <lb/>
            a membrane. The chalazæ at the extremities of the yolk <lb/>
            have nothing to do with generation, as some persons suppose. <lb/>
            These spots are two, one below and one above. If many <lb/>
            whites and yolks of eggs are taken out, and mixed together <lb/>
            in a vessel, and cooked with a slow and moderate heat, <lb/>
            the yolks will all collect in the middle, and the whites will <lb/>
            surround them. Young domestic fowls begin to lay eggs at <lb/>
            the beginning of the spring; they lay more than those <lb/>
            which are older, but those of the young birds are smaller, <lb/>
            and if birds are not permitted to incubate, they are de­ <lb/>
            stroyed and become sick.</p>
          <p>9. After copulation birds ruffle and shake themselves, <lb/>
            and often cover themselves with chaff, and this also they do <lb/>
            when they have laid. Pigeons draw up their tail, geese <lb/>
            go and bathe. The pregnancy and conception of barren <lb/>
            eggs is quick in most birds, as in the partridge, on ac­ <lb/>
            count of the violence of their sexual desires ; for if the hen <lb/>
            stands in the way of the breath of the male, she con­ <lb/>
            ceives, and immediately becomes of no use for fowling ; for <lb/>
            the partridge appears to have a very distinct smell. The <lb/>
            production of the egg after copulation, and the production <lb/>
            of the young by incubation, do not occupy the same length <lb/>
            of time in all birds, but varies according to their size. The <lb/>
            egg of the domestic fowl is perfected in ten days after <lb/>
            sexual intercourse, and that of the pigeon in a shorter time. <lb/>
            Pigeons are able to retain their eggs even in the act of <lb/>
            parturition. If they are disturbed by anything occurring <lb/>
            in the neighbourhood of their nest, or a feather be plucked <lb/>
            out, or if anything else troubles or disturbs them, they re­ <lb/>
            tain the egg they were about to lay.</p>
          <p>10. This is peculiar to pigeons, and so is the following <lb/>
            for they kiss each other when the male is about to mount, <lb/>
            or else they will not endure it. The older bird first gives <pb n="142"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VI </note><lb/>
            a kiss, but afterwards he mounts without kissing, but <lb/>
            younger birds always kiss before copulation. This also is <lb/>
            peculiar to these birds. The females kiss and mount upon <lb/>
            each other like the males, when there is no male present. <lb/>
            They do not project anything into each other, but produce <lb/>
            more eggs than those which produce fertile ones ; from these <lb/>
            eggs nothing is hatched, but they are all barren.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER III.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. THE production of the bird from the egg is alike in then: <lb/>
            all, but the period of completion varies, as I observed be­ <lb/>
            fore. In domestic fowls the first sign of alteration takes <lb/>
            place after three days and nights. This period is longer in <lb/>
            larger birds, and shorter in small birds. During this period <lb/>
            the upper part of the yolk advances to the small extremity <lb/>
            of the egg, which is the beginning of the egg. This is the <lb/>
            part from which the chicken is excluded, and the heart is <lb/>
            visible like a red spot in the white of the egg.</p>
          <p>2. This spot palpitates and moves as though it were en­ <lb/>
            dued with life. From this, as it increases, two involved <lb/>
            sanguineous passages like veins lead to each of the sur­ <lb/>
            rounding tunics ; and a membrane which has sanguineous <lb/>
            passages encloses the white at this period, and separates it <lb/>
            from the venous passages. A short time afterwards the <lb/>
            body is distinguished, at first very small and white, but the <lb/>
            head is distinct, and in this the eyes are the most enlarged. <lb/>
            And this continues for some time, for afterwards the eyes are <lb/>
            reduced in size and approach each other, but the lower part <lb/>
            of the body has not at first any proportion to the upper part.</p>
          <p>3. One of the passages from the heart extends into A <lb/>
            circle around the embryo, and the other to the yolk, as if <lb/>
            it were an umbilical cord. The origin of the young bird <lb/>
            is in the white, its nutriment is derived from the yolk <lb/>
            through the umbilical cord. On the tenth day, the whole <lb/>
            of the young bird and all its parts are distinct, but its <lb/>
            head is still larger than the rest of the body, and the eyes <lb/>
            are larger than the rest of the head. They have no sense <lb/>
            of sight. If the eyes are taken out at this period, they <lb/>
            are larger than beans, and black; when the skin is <lb/>
            taken from them, they are seen to contain a white and cold <pb n="143"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. VI.] </note><lb/>
            fluid, very brilliant in appearance, but without any hard <lb/>
            substance. This is the manner of the development of the <lb/>
            eyes and head.</p>
          <p>4. At the same period the viscera are visible, but the <lb/>
            stomach, and intestines, and the veins from the heart still <lb/>
            appear to extend towards the navel. From the navel a <lb/>
            vein appears to extend upon the membrane which encloses <lb/>
            the yolk, and the yolk itself is at this period fluid, and <lb/>
            more abundant than in its natural state. The other extends <lb/>
            to the membrane which encloses the whole membrane con­ <lb/>
            taining the embryo, and the membrane of the yolk and the <lb/>
            fluid between them, and when the young birds have grown <lb/>
            a little more, part of the yolk goes to one end, and part to <lb/>
            the other, and between them is the fluid white; but the <lb/>
            white is still below the lower part of the yolk, where it was <lb/>
            at first, but at the tenth day the white disappears, for it has <lb/>
            become small, viscid, thick, and rather yellow.</p>
          <p>5. This is the position of all the parts: the first and last <lb/>
            part adjoining the shell is the membrane of the egg, not the <lb/>
            membrane of the shell, but beneath this. This contains the <lb/>
            fluid white; within this is the young bird, and a membrane <lb/>
            surrounding it. and separating it from the fluid; beneath <lb/>
            the embryo is the yolk, to which one of the veins extends, <lb/>
            and the other to the white which encloses it. A membrane <lb/>
            containing a fluid resembling sanies encloses the whole, and <lb/>
            then another membrane which surrounds the embryo itself, <lb/>
            as I observed, and separates it from the fluid. Below this <lb/>
            the yolk, enclosed in another membrane, which is reached <lb/>
            by the umbilical cord from the heart, and the great vein, so <lb/>
            that the embryo does not appear to be in either of the fluids.</p>
          <p>6. About the twentieth day, if the hatching has been de­ <lb/>
            layed beyond this period, the young bird is able to chirp <lb/>
            when moved externally, and if the shell is taken off, by this <lb/>
            time also it is downy. The head is placed over the right leg <lb/>
            upon the side, and the wing is over the head. At this <lb/>
            period the chorion-like membrane is visible, which is united <lb/>
            with the lowest membrane of the shell, to which one of the <lb/>
            umbilical cords passes, and the young bird is complete. The <lb/>
            other chorion-like membrane is also visible, enclosing the <lb/>
            yolk. To this the other umbilical cord extends. Both of <lb/>
            these cords are attached to the heart and the great vein. At <pb n="144"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VI </note><lb/>
            the same period the cord which is attached to one chorion <lb/>
            falls off, and is separated from the animal, but the one which <lb/>
            passes to the yolk remains suspended from the young bird <lb/>
            by a thin bowel, and a considerable portion of the yolk is <lb/>
            contained in the young bird, and some of it is found in the <lb/>
            stomach.</p>
          <p>7. At this period also they eject an excrementitious <lb/>
            matter into the external chorion, and contain it in the <lb/>
            stomach. The external excrement is white, the interna <lb/>
            yellow. At last the yolk, which has been continually <lb/>
            wasting and advancing, is entirely taken up and enclosed in <lb/>
            the young bird. So that portions of it may be observed in <lb/>
            the intestines of birds if they are dissected on the tenth <lb/>
            day after exclusion from the egg. But it is set at liberty <lb/>
            from the navel, nor does any communication remain, but <lb/>
            the whole is separated. About the before-mentioned period <lb/>
            the young bird sleeps, but it stirs itself, and looks up, and <lb/>
            chirps when it is touched, and the heart swells up with the <lb/>
            navel, as if the embryo were breathing. This is the manner <lb/>
            of the development of the chick in the egg.</p>
          <p>8. Birds also produce some barren eggs, as well as those <lb/>
            from sexual intercourse, but they produce nothing after in­ <lb/>
            cubation. This is particularly observed in pigeons. Double <lb/>
            eggs have two yolks ; in some a thin division of white pre­ <lb/>
            vents the yolks from mixing together; others have not this <lb/>
            division, but touch each other. There are some hens which <lb/>
            always lay double eggs, and in these the peculiarities of the <lb/>
            yolks have been observed; for a certain bird having laid <lb/>
            eighteen eggs, hatched two chickens from each of them, ex­ <lb/>
            cept those that were addled; all the rest were productive, <lb/>
            except that one of the twin chickens was lrage and the <lb/>
            other small in each. The last, however, was monstrous.</p>

          <p>1. ALL the pigeon tribe, as the phatta and trygon, generally <lb/>
            produce two eggs; the trygon and the phatta are those <lb/>
            which generally lay three. The pigeon lays, as I said, at <lb/>
            every season; the trygon and the phatta in the spring, and <lb/>
            not more than twice. The second brood are hatched when <lb/>
            the first has been destroyed, for many birds destroy them. <pb n="145"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. VI.] </note><lb/>
            It sometimes lays three, as I have said, but it never brings <lb/>
            out more than two young ones, and sometimes only one, <lb/>
            the remaining egg is always addled. Very few birds begin <lb/>
            to lay before they are a year old ; but when they have once <lb/>
            begun to lay, they all, as we may say, naturally contain eggs <lb/>
            to the end of their life, though it is not easy to see them in <lb/>
            some birds, from their small size.</p>
          <p>2. The pigeon usually produces one male and one female, <lb/>
            and of these the male is often hatched first; and having laid <lb/>
            an egg one day, she omits many days and then lays another. <lb/>
            The male sits during a portion of the day, and the female <lb/>
            during the night. The first young one is hatched and able to <lb/>
            By within twenty days, and the egg is billed on the day before <lb/>
            it is hatched; both the old birds keep the young ones warm <lb/>
            for some time, as they do the eggs. During the time of <lb/>
            bringing up their young the female is fiercer than the male : <lb/>
            this is also the case in other animals. They produce young ten <lb/>
            times in a year, and sometimes eleven times; those in Egypt <lb/>
            even twelve times. The cock and hen birds copulate within <lb/>
            the year, for they do this at the end of six months.</p>
          <p>3. And some say that the phatta and trygon are matured <lb/>
            when three months old, and they consider their great num. <lb/>
            bers as a proof of this. The female contains her eggs four­ <lb/>
            teen days, and then sits upon them fourteen more ; in four­ <lb/>
            teen days after this the young ones By so well that it is <lb/>
            difficult to catch them. The phatta lives, as they say, forty <lb/>
            years; the partridge more than sixteen years. The pigeon, <lb/>
            after having brought out her young, lays again in thirty days.</p>

          <p>1. THE vulture builds its nest in inaccessible rocks, where­ <lb/>
            fore its nest and young ones are rarely seen. For this <lb/>
            reason Herodorus, the father of Bryson the sophist, says <lb/>
            that vultures come from another part of the earth, which is <lb/>
            invisible to us, giving as a reason for his opinion, that they <lb/>
            are seen in great numbers suddenly following the path of an <lb/>
            army. But difficult as it is to observe them, their nests have <lb/>
            been seen. The vulture produces two eggs. No other car­ <lb/>
            nivorous bird has been observed to produce young more than <lb/>
            once a year; but the swallow more frequently produces <lb/>
            young twice a year than the carnivorous birds. If a person <note type="footnote"> L </note> <pb n="146"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VI. </note> <lb/>
            pierces the eyes of young swallows they recover, and are <lb/>
            able to see afterwards.</p>

          <p>1. THE eagle produces three eggs, of which two only are <lb/>
            hatched. This is also related in the poems of Musæus. <lb/>
            The bird which lays three eggs, hatches two, and brings up <lb/>
            but one. This frequently happens; but three young have <lb/>
            been seen in the nest. When the young begin to grow, one <lb/>
            of them is turned out by the parent, because she dislikes the <lb/>
            trouble of feeding it. At this period it is said to be without <lb/>
            food, so that it does not capture the young of wild crea­ <lb/>
            tures, for a few days the talons are turned back, and the <lb/>
            feathers become white, so that it then becomes cruel to its <lb/>
            young. The phene1 receives and brings up the ejected <lb/>
            young one.</p>
          <p>2. The eagle incubates for thirty days; this is the usual <lb/>
            period of incubation for large birds, as the goose and the <lb/>
            bustard. Moderately sized birds usually sit twenty days, as <lb/>
            the ictinus2 and hierax. The ictinus usually produces two <lb/>
            young ones, and sometimes three; the Ætolian kite, as it <lb/>
            is called, sometimes produces four. The raven produces not <lb/>
            only two, but, as they say, many eggs, which she sits upon <lb/>
            for about twenty days. She also turns out some of her <lb/>
            young ones. Many other birds do the same thing; and <lb/>
            generally those which produce several turn out one.</p>
          <p>3. All kinds of eagles do not behave in the same way to <lb/>
            their young ; but the pygargus is cruel; and the black eagles <lb/>
            are careful for the food of their young; but all birds with <lb/>
            crooked talons as soon as their young can fly well beat them <lb/>
            and drive them from the nest. And most birds of other <lb/>
            classes, as I have before observed, do the same thing; and <lb/>
            when they have brought them up, they take no more notice <lb/>
            of them, except the crow. This bird cares for its young a <lb/>
            long while, for as it flies past them it gives them food after <lb/>
            they are able to fly.</p>

          <p>1. THE cuckoo is said by some persons to be a changed hawk, <lb/>
            because the hawk which it resembles disappears when the <note type="footnote"> 1 Vultur cinereus, ossifragus, osprey. </note><note type="footnote">2 Kite. </note><note type="footnote">3 Hawk. </note> <pb n="147"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. VI.] </note> <lb/>
            cuckoo comes, and indeed very few hawks of any sort can be <lb/>
            seen during the period in which the cuckoo is singing except <lb/>
            for a few days. The cuckoo is seen for a short time in the <lb/>
            summer, and disappears in winter. But the hawk has crooked <lb/>
            talons, which the cuckoo has not, nor does it resemble the <lb/>
            hawk in the form of its head, but in both these respects is <lb/>
            more like the pigeon than the hawk, which it resembles in <lb/>
            nothing but its colour; the markings, however, upon the <lb/>
            hawk are like lines, while the cuckoo is spotted.</p>
          <p>2. Its size and manner of flight is like that of the smallest <lb/>
            kind of hawk, which generally disappears during the season <lb/>
            in which the cuckoo is seen. But they have both been seen <lb/>
            at the same time, and the cuckoo was being devoured by the <lb/>
            hawk, though this is never done by birds of the same kind. <lb/>
            They say that no one has ever seen the young of the cuckoo. <lb/>
            It does, however, lay eggs, but it makes no nest; but some­ <lb/>
            times it lays its eggs in the nests of small birds, and devours <lb/>
            their eggs, especially in the nests of the pigeon, when it has <lb/>
            eaten their eggs. Sometimes it lays two, but usually only <lb/>
            one egg ; it lays also in the nest of the hypolais,1 which <lb/>
            hatches and brings it up. At this season it is particularly <lb/>
            fat and sweet-fleshed ; the flesh also of young hawks is very <lb/>
            sweet and fat. There is also a kind of them which builds a <lb/>
            nest in precipitous cliffs.</p>

          <p>1. IN many birds the male alternates with the female in the <lb/>
            duty of incubation, as we observed in speaking of pigeons, <lb/>
            and takes her place while she is obliged to procure food for <lb/>
            herself. In geese the female alone sits upon the eggs, and <lb/>
            having once begun, she never leaves them during the whole <lb/>
            process of incubation. The nests of all water birds are <lb/>
            situated in marshy and grassy places, by which means they <lb/>
            can keep quiet and still have food within their reach, so that <lb/>
            they do not starve all the while. The females alone, among <lb/>
            the crows, Bit on the eggs, which they never leave; but the <lb/>
            males bring them food and feed them.</p>
          <p>2. The females of the pigeons begin to sit at twilight, and <lb/>
            remain on the nest the whole night, till dawn; and the male <lb/>
            the rest of the time. Partridges make two nests of eggo, <note type="footnote">1 Sylvia curucca, hedge sparrow. </note> <note type="footnote"> L 2 </note> <pb n="148"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VI </note> <lb/>
            upon one of which the male sits, on the other the female; <lb/>
            and each of them hatches and brings up its own : and the <lb/>
            male has sexual intercourse with its young as soon as they <lb/>
            are hatched.</p>

          <p>1. THE peacock lives about twenty-five years, and produces <lb/>
            young generally at three years old; by which time also they <lb/>
            have obtained their variegated plumage: and it hatches in <lb/>
            thirty days, or rather more. It only produces young once <lb/>
            a-year, laying twelve eggs, or not quite so many. It lays <lb/>
            its eggs at intervals of two or three days, and not regularly. <lb/>
            At first they lay only eight. The pea-fowl also lays barren <lb/>
            eggs: they copulate in the spring, and lay their eggs imme­ <lb/>
            diately afterwards,</p>
          <p>2. This bird sheds its feathers when the leaves of the <lb/>
            trees begin to fall, and begins to acquire them again with <lb/>
            the first budding in the spring. Those who rear these <lb/>
            birds place the eggs for incubation beneath domestic fowls ; <lb/>
            because the peacock flies at, and torments the hen when <lb/>
            she is sitting; for which reason some of the wild birds <lb/>
            make their escape from the males before they begin to lay <lb/>
            and sit. They place only two eggs under domestic fowls, <lb/>
            for these are all that they can hatch and bring out; and <lb/>
            they take care to put food before them, that they may not <lb/>
            get up and desert their incubation.</p>
          <p>3. Birds at the season of sexual intercourse have large <lb/>
            testicles. In the more lascivious they are always more evi­ <lb/>
            dent, as the domestic cock and the partridge. In those <lb/>
            that are not always lascivious, they are less. This is the <lb/>
            manner of the gestation and reproduction of birds.</p>

          <p>1. IT has been already observed that fish are not always <lb/>
            oviparous, for the selache are always viviparous. All the <lb/>
            rest are oviparous. The selache are viviparous, having <lb/>
            first of all produced ova internally; and these they bring up <lb/>
            in themselves, except the batrachus. Fish have also, as I <lb/>
            observed before, very different uteri in different kinds: for <lb/>
            in the oviparous genera the uterus is double, and situated <lb/>
            low down. In the selache the uterus is more like that of birds. <lb/>
            There is this difference, however, that the ova are not placed <pb n="149"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. VI. </note> <lb/>
            near the diaphragm, but in an intermediate position near <lb/>
            the spine; and when they have grown they change their <lb/>
            place from this part. The ovum in all fish is not of two, but <lb/>
            of one colour ; and it is more white than yellow, both in its <lb/>
            early stages, and after the formation of the embryo.</p>
          <p>2. The development of the ovum is different in fish and <lb/>
            in birds, in that it has not the umbilical cord which passes <lb/>
            to the membrane of the shell; but only the passage which <lb/>
            leads to the yolk in the eggs of birds. The rest of the deve­ <lb/>
            lopment of the ovum is alike in birds and fish ; for it takes <lb/>
            place at the extremity, and the veins have their origin in <lb/>
            a similar manner in the heart; and the head, and eyes, and <lb/>
            upper parts of the body are larger than the rest. As the <lb/>
            young fish increases, the ovum continues to diminish, and <lb/>
            at last it disappears, and is absorbed, like the yolk in the <lb/>
            eggs of birds. The umbilical cord is attached a little below <lb/>
            the abdomen. At first the cord is long, but it becomes less <lb/>
            as the fish grows, and at last is small, and finally absorbed, <lb/>
            like that of birds.</p>
          <p>3. The embryo and the ovum are enclosed in a common <lb/>
            membrane, and beneath this there is another membrane, in <lb/>
            which the embryo alone is enclosed. Between these mem­ <lb/>
            branes there is a fluid substance. The nutriment contained <lb/>
            in the stomach of the young fish is similar to that in the <lb/>
            young birds, partly white, and partly yellow. The form of <lb/>
            the uterus must be learned from dissection. This organ is <lb/>
            different in different fish, as in the galeode by themselves, and <lb/>
            the flat fish by themselves : for in some the ova are attached <lb/>
            near the spine to the centre of the uterus, as I observed be­ <lb/>
            fore, as in scylia.1 They descend when they begin to increase, <lb/>
            when the uterus is double, and are attached to the diaphragm, <lb/>
            as in other fish : the ova descend into each division.</p>
          <p>4. The uterus of these fish, and of the other galeode, has a <lb/>
            small appendage attached to the diaphragm like a white <lb/>
            nipple, which is not present unless they are pregnant. The <lb/>
            scylia and the batis have a shell-like substance, which con­ <lb/>
            tains the fluid of the ovum. In form the shell resembles the <lb/>
            tongue of a wind instrument, and hair-like passages are at­ <lb/>
            tached to the shells. The young of the scylia, which some <lb/>
            persons call nebria galei, are born when the shell falls off and <lb/>
            bursts.The young of the batis when they are brought forth <note type="footnote"> Dog-fish. Squalus stellaris. </note> <pb n="150"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VI. </note> <lb/>
            are excluded by the rupture of the shell. In the acantheas1 <lb/>
            galeos the ova are attached to the diaphragm above the <lb/>
            nipples ; and when the ovum descends, the young is attached <lb/>
            to it after it is set free. The reproduction of the alopex is <lb/>
            in the same manner.</p>
          <p>5. Most galei which are called smooth have the ova placed <lb/>
            between the divisions of the uterus, like those of the scylia; <lb/>
            and as they surround it, they descend into each division of <lb/>
            the uterus, and they are produced, attached to the uterus <lb/>
            by an umbilical cord ; so that when the ova are taken out, <lb/>
            they appear similar to the embryo of quadrupeds. And the <lb/>
            long umbilical cord is attached to the lower part of the <lb/>
            uterus, each part, as it were, attached to an acetabulum; <lb/>
            and to the middle of the embryo near the liver. And when <lb/>
            it is dissected, the food is like an egg, though the ovum be <lb/>
            no longer there. There is a chorion, and peculiar membranes <lb/>
            surrounding each of the embryos, as in quadrupeds.</p>
          <p>6. The head of the embryo when it is just produced, is <lb/>
            upwards ; but as it grows and reaches maturity, it is placed <lb/>
            downwards. The males are placed on the left, and the <lb/>
            females on the right, or there are males and females together <lb/>
            on the same side. The embryo, when dissected, resembles <lb/>
            that of quadrupeds, in having its viscera such as it has, as the <lb/>
            liver, large, and full of blood. In all the selache the ova are <lb/>
            placed high up, near the diaphragm ; many larger, and many <lb/>
            smaller: and the embryos are placed below, wherefore it is <lb/>
            probable that such fish produce their young, and copulate <lb/>
            frequently during the same month, for they do not produce <lb/>
            all their young at once, but frequently, and for a long while; <lb/>
            but those that are in the lower part of the uterus are matured <lb/>
            and brought to perfection.</p>
          <p>7. The other galei both emit and receive their young into <lb/>
            themselves, and so do the rhine and the narca; and a large <lb/>
            narca has been observed to contain eighty young in herself. <lb/>
            The acanthias is the only one of the galei which does not <lb/>
            admit its young into itself, on account of their thorns. <lb/>
            Among the flat fish the trygon and batos do not admit their <lb/>
            young, on account of the roughness of the tail. Neither <lb/>
            does the batrachus admit its young, on account of the size <lb/>
            of their heads, and their thorns; and this is the only one <lb/>
            tha is not viviparous, as I previously observed. These are <note type="footnote">1 Squalus Acanthias. </note> <pb n="151"/>
             <note type="margin">B. VI.] </note> <lb/>
            their mutual differences, and the manner of the develop­ <lb/>
            ment of their ova.</p>
          <p>8. At the season of sexual intercourse, th3 seminal ducts <lb/>
            of the male are full of fluid, so that a white matter escapes <lb/>
            when they are pressed. These passages are divided, and <lb/>
            originate in the diaphragm and the large vein : at the same <lb/>
            season the passages of the male are conspicuous, and may be <lb/>
            compared with the uterus of the female. When it is not <lb/>
            the season of sexual intercourse, they are less conspicuous, <lb/>
            from not being in use. In some fish, and sometimes, they <lb/>
            are not visible at all, as it was remarked of the testicles of <lb/>
            birds. The seminal and uterine passages are different in <lb/>
            other respects also, and because those of the male are at­ <lb/>
            tached to the loins, those of the female are easily moved, <lb/>
            and enclosed in a thin membrane. The nature of the pas­ <lb/>
            sages of the male may be seen in works on anatomy.</p>
          <p>9. The selachea become pregnant again while with young, <lb/>
            and the period of gestation is six months. Among the galei, <lb/>
            the asterias produces young the oftenest; for it produces <lb/>
            twice in a month: it begins to copulate in the month of Sep­ <lb/>
            tember. All the other galei except the scylia produce twice <lb/>
            in the year; the scylia but once. Some of them have their <lb/>
            young in the spring. The rhine produces its first brood in <lb/>
            the spring, and its last in the autumn, near the winter season, <lb/>
            and the setting of the Pleiades. The second fry are the most <lb/>
            numerous. The narea produces its young in the autumn. <lb/>
            The selache descend from the ocean and deep water to the <lb/>
            shore, to produce their young, both for the sake of the <lb/>
            warmth, and care of their offspring.</p>
          <p>10. No other fish but the rhine and the batos have ever <lb/>
            been observed to unite with others not of their own kind, <lb/>
            but there is a fish called the rhinobatus, which has the head <lb/>
            and upper part of the rhine, and the lower part like the <lb/>
            batus, as it were made up of both. The galei and the <lb/>
            galeoeides, as the alopex, dog-fish, and the flat fish, as the <lb/>
            narce batos, leiobatos and trygon, are in this manner ovovi­ <lb/>
            parous.</p>

          <p>1. THE dolphin, whale, and other cetacea which have a <lb/>
            blow-hole but no gills, are viviparous, and so are the <pb n="152"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VI. </note> <lb/>
            pristis and the bos. For none of these have an ovum, but <lb/>
            a proper foetus, from which, when perfected, an animal is <lb/>
            developed, as in man and the viviparous quadrupeds. The <lb/>
            dolphin usually produces one, and sometimes two young <lb/>
            ones. The whale generally and usually produces two and <lb/>
            sometimes one. The phocæna is similar to the dolphin, <lb/>
            for it is like a small dolphin. It is produced in the Pontus. <lb/>
            In some respects the phocæna differs from the dolphin, for <lb/>
            its size is smaller, it is wider in the back, and its colour is <lb/>
            blue. Many persons say that the phocæna is a kind of <lb/>
            dolphin.</p>
          <p>2. All these creatures which have a blow-hole, breathe <lb/>
            and inhale air; and the dolphin has been observed while <lb/>
            asleep with the muzzle above the water, and it snores in <lb/>
            its sleep. The dolphin and phocæna give milk and suckle <lb/>
            their young. They also receive their young into them­ <lb/>
            selves. The growth of the young dolphins is rapid, for <lb/>
            they attain their full size in ten years. The female is preg­ <lb/>
            nant for ten months. The dolphin produces her young <lb/>
            in the summer-time, and at no other season. They seem <lb/>
            also to disappear for thirty days during the season of the <lb/>
            dog-star. The young follow their dam for a long while, <lb/>
            and it is an animal much attached to its offspring. It lives <lb/>
            many years; for some have been known to live twenty-five <lb/>
            or thirty years ; for fishermen have marked them by cutting <lb/>
            their tails and then giving them their liberty. In this way <lb/>
            their age was known.</p>
          <p>3. The seal is amphibious, for it does not inhale water, <lb/>
            but breathes and sleeps. It produces its young on land, <lb/>
            but near the shore, in the manner of animals with feet; but <lb/>
            it lives the greater part of its time, and obtains its food in <lb/>
            the sea, wherefore it is to be considered among aquatic <lb/>
            animals. It is properly viviparous, and produces a living <lb/>
            creature, and a chorion, and it brings forth the other mem­ <lb/>
            branes like a sheep. It produces one or two, never more <lb/>
            than three young ones. It has also mammæ, so that it <lb/>
            suckles its young like quadrupeds. It produces its young <lb/>
            like the human subject, at all seasons of the year, but es­ <lb/>
            pecially with the earliest goats.</p>
          <p>4. When the young are twelve days old, it leads them to <lb/>
            the water several times in the day, in order to habituate <pb n="153"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. VI.] </note> <lb/>
            them by degrees. It drags its hinder parts along, and does <lb/>
            not walk, for it cannot erect itself upon its feet, but it con­ <lb/>
            tracts and draws itself together. It is fleshy and soft, and <lb/>
            its bones are cartilaginous. It is difficult to kill the seal <lb/>
            by violence, unless it is struck upon the temple, for its body <lb/>
            is fleshy. It has a voice like an ox. The pudendum of the <lb/>
            female is like that of the batis, in all other animals of the <lb/>
            class the pudendum resembles that of the human female. <lb/>
            This is the manner of the development and nature of the <lb/>
            young of aquatic animals which are either internally or <lb/>
            externally viviparous.</p>

          <p>1. THE oviparous fish have a divided uterus placed on the <lb/>
            lower part of the body, as I observed before. All that have <lb/>
            scales are viviparous, as the labrax, cestreus, cephalus, etelis,l <lb/>
            and those called white fish, and all smooth fish except the <lb/>
            eel. Their ova resemble sand. This appearance is owing <lb/>
            to their uterus being quite full of ova, so that small fish <lb/>
            appear to have only two ova; for the small size and thinness <lb/>
            of the uterus renders it invisible in these creatures. I have <lb/>
            before treated of the sexual intercourse of fish. The sexes <lb/>
            are distinct in almost all fish, though there is some doubt <lb/>
            about the erythrinus2 and the channa, for all these are <lb/>
            found to be pregnant.</p>
          <p>2. Ova are found in those fish which have sexual inter­ <lb/>
            course, though they possess them without intercourse. <lb/>
            This is observable in some kinds of river fish; for the <lb/>
            phoxini3 appear to be pregnant as soon as they are born, <lb/>
            and when they are quite small. They emit the ova in a <lb/>
            stream; and, as I observed before, the males devour great <lb/>
            numbers of them, and others perish in the water. Those <lb/>
            are preserved which they deposit in their appropriate situa­ <lb/>
            tions. For, if all were preserved, the numbers that would <lb/>
            be found would be immense. Not all those that are pre­ <lb/>
            served are fertile, but only those on which the seminal fluid <lb/>
            of the male has been sprinkled. When the female produces <lb/>
            her ova, the male follows, and scatters his semen upon them. <lb/>
            Young fish are produced from those ova which are thus <lb/>
            sprinkled. The remainder turn out as chance may direct. <note type="footnote"> 1 Perhaps the Sea-bream, Sparus. </note><note type="footnote">2 Perhaps Perca marina. </note> <note type="footnote"> 3 Cyprinus Phoxinus. </note> <pb n="154"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin"> [B. VI </note> 3. The same thing also occurs in the malacia; for the <lb/>
            male sepia sprinkles the ova of the female as they are de­ <lb/>
            posited; and it is reasonable to suppose that the other <lb/>
            malacia do the same, although it has only been observed in <lb/>
            the sepia. They produce their ova near the land, the cobii <lb/>
            deposit them upon stones, and that which they produce is <lb/>
            flat and sand-like. The rest do the same, for the parts near <lb/>
            the land are warmer, and provision is more abundant, and <lb/>
            there is better protection for their young against larger <lb/>
            fish, for which cause very great numbers deposit their ova <lb/>
            near the river Thermodon, in the Pontus, for the place is <lb/>
            sheltered and warm, and the water is sweet.</p>
          <p>4. The majority of viviparous fish reproduce once in <lb/>
            a-year, except the small phycides,l which reproduce twice <lb/>
            a-year. The male phyces differs from the female, being <lb/>
            darker-coloured and having larger scales. All other fish <lb/>
            produce from seed, and emit ova; but that which is called <lb/>
            the belone, at the season of reproduction bursts asunder, <lb/>
            and in this way the ova escape; for this fish has a division <lb/>
            beneath the stomach and bowels, like the serpents called <lb/>
            typhlinæ.2 When it has produced its ova, it survives, and <lb/>
            the wound heals up again.</p>
          <p>5. The development of the ovum is alike, both in those <lb/>
            that are internally and those that are externally oviparous. <lb/>
            For it takes place at the extremityof the ovum, and it is en­ <lb/>
            closed in a membrane. The eyes are the first part that is con­ <lb/>
            spicuous ; they are large and spherical; so that it is plain that <lb/>
            they are mistaken who say that the mode of development re­ <lb/>
            sembles that of vermiform creatures, for in them the order <lb/>
            is different, and the lower parts are formed first, and after­ <lb/>
            wards the head and eyes. When the ovum is taken away, <lb/>
            they assume a circular form, and for some time continue to <lb/>
            grow without taking in any food, by absorbing the moisture <lb/>
            of the ovum. They afterwards derive their nutriment, as <lb/>
            long as they continue growing, from the water of the river.</p>
          <p>6. When the Pontus is cleansed, something is floated <lb/>
            out into the Hellespont which is called fucus. It is of a <lb/>
            yellow colour. Some say that it is naturally a plant. This <lb/>
            takes place at the beginning of summer. The oysters and <lb/>
            small fish which live in these places feed upon this fucus j <note type="footnote">1 MugiL Some species of mullet. </note><note type="footnote">2 Lacerta apus. </note> <pb n="155"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. VI.] </note> <lb/>
            and some maritime persons say that they obtain their purple <lb/>
            from this plant.</p>

            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XIII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. THE pond and river fish begin to reproduce usually when <lb/>
            five months old. They all produce their ova at the begin­ <lb/>
            ning of summer. Like the marine fish, the females of these <lb/>
            kinds never emit all their ova, nor the males all their <lb/>
            semen, at once; but both sexes are always found to con­ <lb/>
            tain a portion of the reproductive substance; they pro­ <lb/>
            duce their ova at the proper season. The cyprinus five or <lb/>
            six times a-year, and especially under the influence of the <lb/>
            stars. The chalets reproduces three times, all the rest but <lb/>
            once a-year.</p>
          <p>2. They deposit their ova in the stagnant parts of rivers <lb/>
            and ponds among the reeds, as the phoxinus and perea. The <lb/>
            glanis and the perca produce their ova in strings, like the <lb/>
            frog. That which the perea produces is so involved that, on <lb/>
            account of its breadth, the fishermen collect it together from <lb/>
            among the reeds in ponds. The larger individuals of the <lb/>
            glanis produce their ova in deep water, some where it is a <lb/>
            fathom deep; but the smaller ones in shallow water, and <lb/>
            especially at the root of the willow or some other tree, and <lb/>
            among the reeds and mosses.</p>
          <p>3. The fish fold themselves together, sometimes a large <lb/>
            one with a small one, and approximate the passages, which <lb/>
            some call their navel, from which they eject their respective <lb/>
            seminal matter, the females their ova, and the males their <lb/>
            spermatic fluid. Those ova with which the semen of the <lb/>
            male has been mixed immediately or in the course of a day <lb/>
            become whiter and larger, and in a short time the eyes of <lb/>
            the fish make their appearance; for in all fish, as in other <lb/>
            animals, this part is most conspicuous, and appears the largest. <lb/>
            But, if the seminal fluid does not touch any of the ova, as in <lb/>
            the case of sea-fish, these become useless and barren.</p>
          <p>4. From the fertile ova, as the fish increase in size, some­ <lb/>
            thing like a shell is separated; this is the membrane which <lb/>
            envelopes the ovum and the embryo fish. As soon as the <lb/>
            seminal fluid is mixed with the ova a glutinous matter is <lb/>
            formed, which fastens them to the roots or other substance <lb/>
            on which they are deposited. The male watches over the <lb/>
            place where the greatest number of ova are deposited and <pb n="156"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. VI. </note> <lb/>
            the female departs as soon as she has spawned. The develop­ <lb/>
            ment of the ovum of the glanis proceeds the most slowly, for <lb/>
            the male remains by them for forty or fifty days, in order <lb/>
            that they may not be devoured by fish chancing to come <lb/>
            that way.</p>
          <p>5. Next to this is the cyprinus. The ova, however, of <lb/>
            these which are preserved escape very quickly. The deve­ <lb/>
            lopment in some of the small fish takes place on the third <lb/>
            day, and the ova upon which the seminal fluid has fallen <lb/>
            begin to increase on the same day, or shortly afterwards. <lb/>
            The ova of the glanis become as large as the seed of the <lb/>
            orobus. Those of the cyprinus and that class, about the <lb/>
            size of millet. The ova of these fish are produced and deve­ <lb/>
            loped in this manner.</p>
          <p>6. The chalets assembles in great numbers to deposit its <lb/>
            ova in deep water. The fish which is called tilon deposits <lb/>
            its ova near the shore, in sheltered places; this fish also is <lb/>
            gregarious. The cyprinus, balerus, and all others, so to <lb/>
            say, hasten into shallow water to deposit their ova, and thir­ <lb/>
            teen or fourteen males often follow a single female, and when <lb/>
            the female has deposited her ova and departed, the males <lb/>
            that follow her sprinkle their semen upon them. The majo­ <lb/>
            rity of the ova are lost, for the female scatters them abroad <lb/>
            as she is moving forward, unless they fall upon any sub­ <lb/>
            stance, and are not carried away by the stream. None of <lb/>
            them, except the glanis, watch their ova, unless the cyprinus <lb/>
            meets with them in great numbers, when, they say, that this <lb/>
            fish watches them.</p>
          <p>7. All the male fish have semen, except the eel, and this <lb/>
            one has neither semen nor ova. The cestreus migrates from <lb/>
            the sea into lakes and rivers ; the eel, on the contrary, leaves <lb/>
            them for the sea. Most fish, therefore, as I observed, pro­ <lb/>
            ceed from ova.</p>

          <p>1. SOME originate in mud and sand: even of those kinds which <lb/>
            originate in sexual intercourse and ova, some, they say, have <lb/>
            appeared both in other marshy places and in those which once <lb/>
            surrounded Cnidus, which became dry under the influence of <lb/>
            the dog-star, and all the mud was parched up, but with the <lb/>
            first rains the waters returned, and small fish appeared with <pb n="157"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. VI.] </note> <lb/>
            the return of the waters. This was a kind of cestreus, which <lb/>
            originates in coition, about the size of small mænidia,1 but <lb/>
            they had neither ova nor semen. In the Asiatic rivers, <lb/>
            which do not flow into the sea, other small fish, of the size <lb/>
            of epseti,2 are produced in the same manner. Some persons <lb/>
            say that the cestreus is always produced in this manner, but <lb/>
            in this they are mistaken, for both the females are known <lb/>
            to have ova and the males semen. But there is some one <lb/>
            kind of them which originates in mud and sand.</p>
          <p>2. It is evident from the following considerations that <lb/>
            some of them are of spontaneous growth, and do not origi­ <lb/>
            nate either in ova or semen. Those which are neither ovi­ <lb/>
            parous nor viviparous are all produced either from mud or <lb/>
            sand, or from the putrid matter on the surface, as also the <lb/>
            foam in sandy places produces the aphya.3 This aphya never <lb/>
            increases in size, and is barren, and as time advances it <lb/>
            perishes, and another fry is formed. Wherefore it may be <lb/>
            said to be reproduced at every season, except for a short <lb/>
            time; for it continues from the autumn arcturus to the <lb/>
            spring. This is a proof that it sometimes originates in the <lb/>
            soil, for it is not captured by fishermen in cold weather, but <lb/>
            on a fine day it may be taken as it comes up from the ground <lb/>
            for the sake of the warmth. When they have dragged the <lb/>
            ground and scraped up the surface, the fish are more nume­ <lb/>
            rous and better. The other aphyæ are inferior, on account <lb/>
            of their rapid growth.</p>
          <p>3. They are found in shady and marshy places, when the <lb/>
            earth becomes warm in fine weather, as near the temple <lb/>
            of Athene in Salamis, and near the tomb of Themistocles, <lb/>
            and near Marathon, for foam is formed in all these places. <lb/>
            It makes its appearance in such places, and in fine weather : <lb/>
            it appears also at times in seasons of much rain, and when <lb/>
            foam is formed of rain water, wherefore also it is called <lb/>
            aphrus ; and sometimes it is found on the surface of the sea, <lb/>
            in fine weather, where it is whirled about, and, like the little <lb/>
            maggots in dung, so this is found in the foam which floats on <lb/>
            the surface; wherefore also this aphya is carried by the sea <lb/>
            in many directions, and it abounds and is captured in the <lb/>
            greatest abundance when the season is moist and warm.</p>
          <p>4. There is another aphya derived from fish, for that <lb/>
            which is called cobitis is derived from small and inferior <note type="footnote">1 Sardine. </note><note type="footnote">2Atherine epsetos. </note><note type="footnote">3 Melanurus juvenculus. </note> <pb n="158"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VI. </note> <lb/>
            gobii, which bury themselves in the earth. The membrades <lb/>
            are produced from the phalerica. The trichides come from <lb/>
            these, and the trichiæ from the trichides ; from one kind of <lb/>
            aphya, which inhabits the port of Athens, the encrasicoli <lb/>
            are derived. There is another kind of aphya which originates <lb/>
            in the mœnis and cestreus, but the barren aphrus is very <lb/>
            soft, and endures only for a short time, as I said before, and <lb/>
            at last nothing is left but the head and eyes. The fisher­ <lb/>
            men, however, have now found a mode of conveying it from <lb/>
            place to place, for it lasts longer when salted.</p>

          <p>1. EELS are not produced from sexual intercourse, nor are <lb/>
            they oviparous, nor have they ever been detected with semen <lb/>
            or ova, nor when dissected do they appear to possess either <lb/>
            seminal or uterine viscera; and this is the only kind of san­ <lb/>
            guineous animal which does not originate either in sexual <lb/>
            intercourse or in ova. It is, however, manifest that this is <lb/>
            the case, for, after rain, they have been reproduced in some <lb/>
            marshy ponds, from which all the water was drawn and the <lb/>
            mud cleaned out; but they are never produced in dry places <lb/>
            nor in ponds that are always full, for they live upon and are <lb/>
            nourished by rain water. It is plain, therefore, that they <lb/>
            are not produced either from sexual intercourse or from ova. <lb/>
            Some persons have thought that they were productive, be. <lb/>
            cause some eels have parasitical worms, and they thought <lb/>
            that these became eels.</p>
          <p>2. This, however, is not the case, but they originate in <lb/>
            what are called the entrails of the earth, which are found <lb/>
            spontaneously in mud and moist earth. They have been <lb/>
            observed making their escape from them, and others have <lb/>
            been found in them when cut up and dissected. These <lb/>
            originate both in the sea and in rivers wherein putrid mat­ <lb/>
            ter is abundant; in those places in the sea which are full of <lb/>
            fuel, and near the banks of rivers and ponds, for in these <lb/>
            places the heat causes much putridity. This is the mode of <lb/>
            generation in eels.</p>

          <p>1. THE reproductive function is not active in all fish at the <lb/>
            same time or the same manner, nor are they pregnant during <lb/>
            the same length of time. Before the season of sexual inter- <pb n="159"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. VI.] </note> <lb/>
            course the males and females begin to assemble, and at the <lb/>
            period of intercourse and the production of their ova they pair <lb/>
            together. Some of them do not remain pregnant more than <lb/>
            thirty days, and others not so long; but all of them remain <lb/>
            so for a number of days, which can be distributed into seven. <lb/>
            Those which some persons call marini remain pregnant for <lb/>
            the longest period. The sargus becomes pregnant in the <lb/>
            month of December, and remains so for thirty days. The <lb/>
            kind of cestreus which some persons call the chelon and the <lb/>
            myxon are pregnant at the same time as the sargus. All <lb/>
            these suffer in their pregnancy, wherefore they are driven to <lb/>
            the shore at this season; for in the vehemence of their desire <lb/>
            they are carried towards the land, and always continue in <lb/>
            motion during this period till they have produced their ova. <lb/>
            The cestreus is more remarkable for this than any other fish. <lb/>
            As soon as they have deposited their ova, they become quiet.</p>
          <p>2. In many fish there is a limit to their reproductive powers, <lb/>
            when worms make their appearance in their abdomen. These <lb/>
            worms are small living creatures, which expel the repro­ <lb/>
            ductive substance. The small fry of the rhyas makes its ap­ <lb/>
            pearance in the spring, and that of many others about the <lb/>
            vernal equinox. Other fish do not produce at this season of <lb/>
            the year, but in the summer or near the autumnal equinox.</p>
          <p>3. The atherina produces its young first of all, near the <lb/>
            land. The cephalus is the last. This is evident from the <lb/>
            small fry of the former appearing first, and that of the latter <lb/>
            last of all. The cestreus also produces among the first. The <lb/>
            salpa in most places deposits its ova during the summer, and <lb/>
            sometimes in the autumn. The aulopias, which they call <lb/>
            anthias, produces its ova in the summer season. After these <lb/>
            the chrysophrys, labrax, mormyrus, and all those which are <lb/>
            called dromades; the trigla and cocarinus are the latest of <lb/>
            all the gregarious fish. These oviposit in the autumn. The <lb/>
            trigla deposits her ova in the mud, which causes her to be <lb/>
            late, for the mud continues cold for a long while. The cora­ <lb/>
            cimus is next to the trigla, and goes among the sea weed to <lb/>
            deposit her ova: consequently they frequent rocky places. <lb/>
            It continues pregnant for a long while. The mænides <lb/>
            oviposit at the winter solstice. Many other marine fish <lb/>
            oviposit in the summer, for they are not captured at this <lb/>
            period. The mænis is the most productive of all fish, and <pb n="160"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VI </note> <lb/>
            the batrachus the most so among the selache. They are, <lb/>
            however, rare, for they perish very readily ; they oviposit in <lb/>
            shoals and near the land.</p>
          <p>4. The selache, as being viviparous, are less productive. <lb/>
            These are particularly preserved by their large size. The <lb/>
            belone is late in producing its young, and many of them are <lb/>
            burst by their ova in the act of parturition; for these ova <lb/>
            are not so numerous as they are large. They surround the <lb/>
            parent as if they were phalangia; for she produces them <lb/>
            attached to herself, and if any one touches them they make <lb/>
            their escape. The atherina deposits her ova by rubbing her <lb/>
            abdomen against the sand. The thynni burst with fat. They <lb/>
            live two years. The fishermen argue thus: when the thyn­ <lb/>
            nides fail one year, the thynni fail the year after. They <lb/>
            appear to be a year older than the pelamus.</p>
          <p>5. The thynni and scombri copulate at the end of Fe­ <lb/>
            bruary, and produce their young at the beginning of June. <lb/>
            They produce their ova, as it were, in a purse. The growth <lb/>
            of the thynnides is rapid; for when these fish produce their <lb/>
            young in the Pontus, they produce from the ovum creatures <lb/>
            which some persons call scordylae, and the Byzantines call <lb/>
            auxidæ, because they grow in a few days. They go out in <lb/>
            the autumn with the thynnus, and return in the spring as <lb/>
            pelamides. Nearly all other fish grow rapidly, but those in <lb/>
            the Pontus more rapidly than in other places; for the amiæ <lb/>
            there increase visibly every day. It is necessary to re­ <lb/>
            member that the same fish have not in the same place the <lb/>
            identical time of coition and gestation, nor the same period <lb/>
            of reproduction and completion of their offspring. For those <lb/>
            which are called coracini produce their ova at the time of <lb/>
            wheat harvest, though, generally speaking, the order of their <lb/>
            reproduction is that which I have mentioned.</p>
          <p>6. The conger also becomes pregnant, though this circum­ <lb/>
            stance is not equally distinct everywhere on account of its <lb/>
            fat; for the organ of reproduction is long, like that of ser­ <lb/>
            pents. It becomes distinct, however, when laid upon the <lb/>
            fire; for the fat smokes and consumes away, and the ova, <lb/>
            when pressed, jump out with a cracking noise. If any <lb/>
            person will feel and rub them with the finger, the fat will <lb/>
            appear smooth and the ova rough to the touch. Some con­ <lb/>
            geris have fat but no ova; and others, on the contrary, have <pb n="161"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. VI.] </note> <lb/>
            DO fat but such ova as I have described. We have now <lb/>
            treated of nearly all the oviparous animals, whether furnished <lb/>
            with fins, or wings, or feet, and of their sexual intercourse, <lb/>
            gestation, development, and such like subjects.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XVII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. WE must now treat of the nature of viviparous animals with <lb/>
            feet and of man at this period. We have already treated in <lb/>
            general and in particular of their mode of coition. It is <lb/>
            common to all animals to be elevated with the desire and <lb/>
            pleasure of sexual intercourse. The females become savage <lb/>
            when their young are produced, the males at the season of <lb/>
            coition; for horses bite each other and drive about and pur­ <lb/>
            sue their riders. The wild boars are very savage at this sea­ <lb/>
            son, although coition renders them weak.</p>
          <p>2. And they fight wonderfully among themselves, and <lb/>
            make themselves as it were breastplates, and render their <lb/>
            skin callous beforehand by rubbing themselves against trees <lb/>
            and frequently wallowing in the mud and drying themselves. <lb/>
            They fight together and drive each other out of the herd so <lb/>
            fiercely, that not rarely both of them perish in the fight. <lb/>
            The same is the nature of bulls, rams, and goats; for although <lb/>
            at other seasons they pasture together, at the period of co­ <lb/>
            pulation they quarrel and fight together. The male camel <lb/>
            also is violent at this time, whether it is a man or a camel that <lb/>
            approaches him, and he will at all times fight with a horse.</p>
          <p>3. The nature of wild animals is the same. For bears, <lb/>
            wolves, and lions are savage if they are approached at this <lb/>
            season; but they do not quarrel much among themselves, <lb/>
            for none of them are gregarious. The she bears are savage <lb/>
            in defence of their cubs, and bitches for their puppies. Ele­ <lb/>
            phants also become wild at this period. Wherefore they say <lb/>
            that in India those who have the care of them do not permit <lb/>
            them to have sexual intercourse with the females; for they <lb/>
            become mad at such season and overturn the houses, which <lb/>
            are badly built, and do many other violent acts. They say <lb/>
            also that abundance of food will render them more gentle. <lb/>
            They also bring others among them which are directed to <lb/>
            beat them, and so they punish them and reduce them to a <lb/>
            state of discipline.</p>
          <p>4. Those creatures which have frequent sexual intercourse, <note type="footnote"> M </note> <pb n="162"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VI. </note> <lb/>
            like domestic animals, as the hog and dog, appear to be less <lb/>
            influenced by these circumstances on account of the fre­ <lb/>
            quency of their coition. Of all females the mare is the most <lb/>
            violent in her sexual desires, and then the cow. Mares are <lb/>
            subject to the affection called hippomania, and this name is <lb/>
            transferred from this single animal to intemperate and lasci­ <lb/>
            vious persons. They are said to be affected by the wind at <lb/>
            such seasons: wherefore in Crete they never separate the <lb/>
            stallions from the mares. When the mares are thus affected, <lb/>
            they separate themselves from the other horses. In swine <lb/>
            the same affection is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰαπίξειν</foreign> to desire the boar. <lb/>
            They never run to the east or the west, but either north or <lb/>
            south.</p>
          <p>5. When they suffer from this affection, they will allow <lb/>
            no one to approach them, till they either are so fatigued that <lb/>
            they can go no further, or come to the sea: they then eject <lb/>
            some substance, which has received the name of hippomanes, <lb/>
            like that on a new-born colt. It resembles the capria of <lb/>
            the sow. Poisoners diligently seek for this substance. At <lb/>
            the season of sexual intercourse they lean upon each other <lb/>
            more than at other times, and move their tails, and utter a <lb/>
            different sound from that which is common to them. A <lb/>
            fluid like semen also flows from their genital organs, but it <lb/>
            is much more thin than that of the male ; and some per­ <lb/>
            sons call this fluid hippomanes, though it is not that <lb/>
            which is produced upon colts. It is difficult to collect <lb/>
            this fluid, for it does not appear in large quantities. <lb/>
            When they are desirous of sexual intercourse, they often <lb/>
            make water, and sport together: this is the nature of <lb/>
            horses.</p>
          <p>6. Cows desire the bull. They are so taken up by their <lb/>
            passion, that the cowherds cannot manage them. Mares <lb/>
            and cows shew the vehemence of their desire by the swelling <lb/>
            of their genital parts. Cows also, like mares, make water <lb/>
            very frequently. The cows also mount upon the bull, and <lb/>
            follow, and stand beside him. The younger animals, both <lb/>
            among horses and oxen, are the first to desire sexual inter­ <lb/>
            course ; and in fine weather, when their health is good, the <lb/>
            vehemence of their desire is still stronger. If the manes <lb/>
            of the mares are cut, their desires become weaker, and they <lb/>
            are rendered more gentle. <pb n="163"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin"> B. VI.] </note> 7. The stallions recognise the mares of their own herds <lb/>
            by the scent; and if any strangers become mixed with them <lb/>
            a few days before the period of coition, they bite them till <lb/>
            they go away, and each stallion feeds apart with his own <lb/>
            mares. Thirty mares, or rather less, are given to each ; and <lb/>
            if any male approaches, he turns and goes round the mares <lb/>
            in a circle, and then prepares to fight. If any one of the <lb/>
            females attempts to move, he bites and prevents her.</p>
          <p>8. At the season of sexual intercourse the bull pastures <lb/>
            with the cows, and fights with other bulls: at other times <lb/>
            the sexes keep themselves separate: this is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀτιμαγελει̃ν</foreign> <lb/>
            (despising the herd) ; those in Epirus are often not seen for <lb/>
            three months: and generally all, or nearly all, wild animals, <lb/>
            do not herd with their females before the season of sexual <lb/>
            intercourse: but as soon as they come to puberty the males <lb/>
            separate themselves, and cease to feed with the females. <lb/>
            Sows, when they are urged by sexual desire, or, as it is <lb/>
            called, desire the boar (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰαπᾳν</foreign>), will even attack men. <lb/>
            In bitches this affection is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϭϰυζν</foreign>, to desire the <lb/>
            dog.</p>
          <p>9. When females are urged with desire, their genital organs <lb/>
            are swollen with heat, and a fluid secretion takes place. <lb/>
            Mares scatter about a white fluid at this season. In no <lb/>
            creatures are the catamenia so abundant as in women. In <lb/>
            sheep and goats at the season of coition, there are certain <lb/>
            signs before copulation: there are also signs after copu­ <lb/>
            lation, but these again cease till the period of parturition, <lb/>
            when they again occur. By this means shepherds under­ <lb/>
            stand that they are about to produce their young. After <lb/>
            parturition there is a great purification, which at first is not <lb/>
            very full of blood, but becomes so afterwards.</p>
          <p>10. In the cow, the ass, and mare, this purification is <lb/>
            abundant, on account of their great size; but still it is <lb/>
            small, considering how large they are. When the cow is <lb/>
            urged by desire, she undergoes a brief purification, about <lb/>
            half-a-cup full, or a little more. The time of this purification <lb/>
            is peculiarly the period for sexual intercouse. Of all quad­ <lb/>
            rupeds the mare suffers the least, and is the most cleanly in <lb/>
            parturition: neither is her loss of blood great considering <lb/>
            the size of the animal. In cows and mares, the failure of <lb/>
            the catamenia in the second, fourth, and sixth month is con- <note type="footnote"> M 2 </note> <pb n="164"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VI. </note> <lb/>
            sidered as a sign of pregnancy; but it is not easy for anyone <lb/>
            to understand this, who does not follow and accustom him* <lb/>
            self to their: and some persons are of opinion that they have <lb/>
            no catamenia. The female oreus has no catamema, but her <lb/>
            urine is thicker than that of the male.</p>
          <p>11. On the whole, the liquid excrements are thicker in <lb/>
            other animals than in man; and those of female sheep and <lb/>
            goats thicker than in the males of the same animal. That <lb/>
            of the she ass is thinner, of the cow is harsher, than of their <lb/>
            respective males. After parturition the urine of all creatures <lb/>
            becomes thicker, and especially in those which have no puri­ <lb/>
            fication. When females begin to feel sexual desires, their <lb/>
            milk is like pus; it afterwards becomes useful after parturi­ <lb/>
            tion. Sheep and goats become fat when they are pregnant, <lb/>
            and consume more food ; and so do cows, and all other quad­ <lb/>
            rupeds.</p>

          <p>1. GENERALLY speaking, the sexual desires of animals are <lb/>
            more violent in spring. They do not all, however, copulate <lb/>
            at the same seasons, but at the time of year which will cause <lb/>
            them to produce their young at the proper season. The <lb/>
            period of gestation in domestic swine is four months. They <lb/>
            never produce more than twenty pigs; and if they have <lb/>
            many, they cannot bring them all up. When aged, they <lb/>
            produce in the same manner, but they copulate more <lb/>
            slowly. They become pregnant with one act of coition; <lb/>
            but they submit themselves to the boar very frequently, on <lb/>
            account of their rejection of the capria after they are preg­ <lb/>
            nant. This takes place in all, but some will also eject the <lb/>
            semen.</p>
          <p>2. If any of the pigs are injured or deteriorated during <lb/>
            pregnancy, it is called metachæron. This may take place in <lb/>
            any part of the uterus. In parturition the sow gives the <lb/>
            first teat to the first pig. It is not necessary that she should <lb/>
            go to the boar as soon as the sexual appetite is felt, or before <lb/>
            her ears begin to hang down; for otherwise she desires to <lb/>
            go again. If she goes to the boar when she is desirous of it, <lb/>
            the impregnation is complete in a single act of intercourse. <lb/>
            Barley is a proper food for the boar at the period of coition. <lb/>
            It should be cooked for the female after parturition. Some <pb n="165"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. VI. </note> <lb/>
            BOWS produce excellent pigs from the first; others do not <lb/>
            produce good offspring and pigs till they are grown up. <lb/>
            Some persons say that if one of the eyes of a sow is put out, <lb/>
            she generally speaking dies very soon. Most of them live <lb/>
            fifteen. Some die in less than twenty years.</p>

          <p>1. SHEEP become pregnant after three or four acts of sexual <lb/>
            intercourse. If rain falls after the act of intercourse, it <lb/>
            must be repeated. The nature of goats is the same. They <lb/>
            generally produce two, and sometimes three. Cases have <lb/>
            occurred of their producing four. The period of gestation <lb/>
            in the sheep and goat is five months; and in some places, <lb/>
            where the weather is warm and fine, and food is abundant, <lb/>
            they have young twice a-year. The goat will live eight <lb/>
            years. The sheep lives ten years, or generally rather less; <lb/>
            but the leaders of the flock live fifteen years; for in every <lb/>
            flock they select one of the males as a leader, who, when <lb/>
            called by the shepherd, places himself at the head of the <lb/>
            flock. They are accustomed to this duty even when young. <lb/>
            In Ethiopia the sheep live twelve or thirteen years, and the <lb/>
            goats ten or eleven.</p>
          <p>2. Both the sheep and goat enjoy sexual intercourse as <lb/>
            long as they live. Sheep and goats produce twins, if either <lb/>
            the pasture is good, or the ram or he-goat, or the ewe <lb/>
            belongs to a race producing twins. They produce females <lb/>
            or males both from the nature of the water (for there are <lb/>
            some waters that cause them to produce males and others <lb/>
            females) and from their manner of sexual intercourse; and <lb/>
            if the wind is northward during copulation they produce <lb/>
            males; and if it is southward, females; and one which na­ <lb/>
            turally produces females will change its nature and produce <lb/>
            males; so that it is necessary to see that they stand to the <lb/>
            north during the act of sexual intercourse. If any are ac­ <lb/>
            customed to copulate early, and the ram is introduced to <lb/>
            them late, they will not endure it.</p>
          <p>3. The lambs are white or black according as the veins <lb/>
            beneath the tongue of the ram are white or black; for the <lb/>
            lambs are white if the veins are white, and black if they are <lb/>
            black. If they are both black and white, the lambs also are <lb/>
            of two colours; and if red, then the lambs are red. They <pb n="166"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. VI. </note> <lb/>
            are more ready for sexual intercourse if they drink salt <lb/>
            water; so that they should be supplied with salted water <lb/>
            both before and after parturition, and again in the spring. <lb/>
            The herdsmen do not constitute any leader among the flocks <lb/>
            of goats, because it is not their nature to be stationary, but <lb/>
            they are active and ready to move from place to place. If <lb/>
            the older sheep prepare for sexual intercourse at the proper <lb/>
            time, the shepherds consider it a sign of a good year for the <lb/>
            sheep ; if the younger ones are ready first, it will be a bad <lb/>
            sheep year.</p>

          <p>1. THERE are many kinds of dogs. The Lacedemonian dogs, <lb/>
            both male and female, begin to have sexual intercourse at <lb/>
            eight months old. Some also lift their leg to make water <lb/>
            about this period. The bitch becomes pregnant with a single <lb/>
            act of coition; this is particularly evident in those which per­ <lb/>
            form the act in secret, for they become pregnant when once <lb/>
            united. The period of gestation in the Lacedemonian bitch <lb/>
            is the sixth part of a year, that is sixty days, or it may be one, <lb/>
            two, or three days more or less. The puppies when they <lb/>
            are born are blind for twelve days. The bitch is ready for <lb/>
            sexual intercourse six months after she has produced her <lb/>
            young, and not sooner. In some the period of gestation <lb/>
            is the fifth part of a year, this is seventy-two days. The <lb/>
            puppies of such bitches are blind for fourteen days. Others <lb/>
            are pregnant the fourth part of a year, that is three whole <lb/>
            months; their puppies are blind seventeen days. The fe­ <lb/>
            male appears, to desire the male for the same length of time.</p>
          <p>2. The catamenia in bitches last for seven days, and at <lb/>
            the same time the genital organs are swollen with heat; <lb/>
            during this period they will not endure coition, but during <lb/>
            the seven days which follow, for they all appear usually to <lb/>
            desire the male for fourteen days. This affection continues <lb/>
            in some for sixteen days. The purification from parturition <lb/>
            takes place at the birth of the young ones; it is thick <lb/>
            and phlegmatic, and the quantity produced in partu­ <lb/>
            rition is small in proportion to the size of the body.1 <lb/>
            Bitches generally have milk five days before parturition; in <note type="footnote">1 (Or perhaps) after parturition the discharge becomes thinner in <lb/>
            consistence. </note> <pb n="167"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. VI.] </note> <lb/>
            some cases it appears seven, and in others four days before­ <lb/>
            hand ; the milk is good as soon as the young are born. The <lb/>
            Lacedemonian bitch gives milk in thirty days after sexual <lb/>
            intercourse; at first it is thick, but becomes thinner after­ <lb/>
            wards. The milk of the bitch is thicker than that of other <lb/>
            animals, except the sow and the hare.</p>
          <p>3. There is evidence of their having reached the age of pu­ <lb/>
            berty, for as in the human subject the mammæ begin to <lb/>
            enlarge and become cartilaginous ; it is, however, difficult to <lb/>
            detect this without practice, for the enlargement is not very <lb/>
            great. This takes place in the female, nothing of the kind <lb/>
            occurs in the male. The males generally begin to lift up their <lb/>
            leg to make water when they are six months old. Some do <lb/>
            not do so till they are eight months old, and others before <lb/>
            they are six months old, for, to speak plainly, they do this as <lb/>
            soon as they reach puberty ; all the females sit down to make <lb/>
            water; some, however, even of these lift up their leg for <lb/>
            this purpose. The female never produces more than twelve <lb/>
            puppies, generally five or six, and sometimes only one; <lb/>
            those of Lacedæmon generally have eight; both sexes con­ <lb/>
            tinue to enjoy sexual intercourse as long as they live.</p>
          <p>4. It is a peculiarity of the Lacedemonian dog, that it is <lb/>
            more ready for sexual intercourse after hard work than when <lb/>
            idle; the male of this kind lives ten years, the female for twelve, <lb/>
            most other dogs live fourteen or fifteen years, some even <lb/>
            twenty, for which reason some persons think that Homer is <lb/>
            right when he makes the dog of Ulysses to have died at <lb/>
            the age of twenty. On account of the hard work which the <lb/>
            Lacedemonian dogs have to endure the female lives longer <lb/>
            than the male; in other races this is not so plainly observed, <lb/>
            but the male is usually longer lived than the female. The <lb/>
            dog does not shed any teeth except those called the canine <lb/>
            teeth, these are shed by both sexes at four months old. <lb/>
            Because they shed these only, a question is raised, for some <lb/>
            persons altogether deny that they shed only two teeth, for <lb/>
            it is difficult to meet with these, and others, when they see <lb/>
            that they shed these, think that they must shed all their <lb/>
            teeth. People judge of the age of a dog by its teeth, for in <lb/>
            young dogs they are white and sharp, in old ones they are <lb/>
            clack and blunted. <pb n="168"/>

          <p>1. THE cow is impregnated with a single act of coition, <lb/>
            and the bull mounts upon her with such violence that she <lb/>
            bends beneath his weight. If he fails to impregnate her <lb/>
            after twenty days, she is again admitted to the bull. Old <lb/>
            bulls will not mount the same cow several times in the <lb/>
            same day unless there is some intermission, but young bulls, <lb/>
            incited by the strength of their desires, will force the same <lb/>
            cow several times, and will mount upon many in succession. <lb/>
            The bull is one of the least lascivious of animals. The <lb/>
            conqueror copulates with the female, but if he become im­ <lb/>
            potent from frequent sexual intercourse, the inferior will <lb/>
            attack him, and often prevail.</p>
          <p>2. Both the male and the female commence sexual inter­ <lb/>
            course, so as to produce young, at a year old, though not <lb/>
            generally till they are a year and eight months old, or two <lb/>
            years old according to general agreement. The female is <lb/>
            pregnant nine months, and produces her young in the tenth <lb/>
            month; some persons affirm that parturition takes place at <lb/>
            ten months to a day ; if any of them calve before the above <lb/>
            mentioned time, the calf is abortive and does not live, and <lb/>
            even if born a little before the proper time it cannot live, <lb/>
            for the hoofs are imperfect. The female generally produces <lb/>
            one at a time, sometimes two. She continues to bear and <lb/>
            to have sexual intercourse as long as she lives.</p>
          <p>3. The female usually lives fifteen years, and so does <lb/>
            the male if he is not castrated; some live for more than <lb/>
            twenty years if they have an active body. They usually <lb/>
            place castrated oxen as leaders of the herd, as they do in <lb/>
            sheep, and these live longer than the others, for they do <lb/>
            no work, and feed in a superior pasture. They attain per­ <lb/>
            fection at five years old, wherefore some say that Homer <lb/>
            was right when he spoke of the male flourishing at five <lb/>
            years old, and the cow at nine years old, for both expres­ <lb/>
            sions have the same meaning.</p>
          <p>4. Oxen change their teeth at two years old, not all of them, <lb/>
            however, but only like the horse ; they do not cast their hoofs <lb/>
            when they are lame, but only swell very much about the <lb/>
            feet. The milk is good immediately after calving, but the <lb/>
            cow has no milk beforehand. The milk which is first formed <pb n="169"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. VI.] </note> <lb/>
            becomes hard like a stone when it is coagulated; this takes <lb/>
            place if it is not mixed with water. They do not produce <lb/>
            young before they are a year old, except in some remarkable <lb/>
            cases, for some have been known to copulate at four months <lb/>
            old. Most of them desire sexual intercourse in the months <lb/>
            of April and May. Some, however, are not impregnated <lb/>
            before the autumn. When many become pregnant and <lb/>
            admit the male, it is a sign of cold and rainy weather. The <lb/>
            usual discharges occur in cows as they do in mares, but the <lb/>
            quantity is less.</p>

          <p>1. BOTH the horse and mare begin to use sexual intercourse <lb/>
            at two years old. Such early cases, however, are rare, and <lb/>
            their offspring small and weak; and generally they com­ <lb/>
            mence at three years old, and they continue to produce <lb/>
            better colts till they are twenty years old. The period of <lb/>
            gestation is eleven months; parturition takes place in the <lb/>
            twelfth. The male does not impregnate the female in any <lb/>
            particular number of days; but at times in one, two, or <lb/>
            three, sometimes in more. The ass mounts and impregnates <lb/>
            more quickly than the horse; and the act of intercourse is <lb/>
            not laborious in horses as it is in oxen. Next to the human <lb/>
            subject, the horse in both sexes is the most lascivious of all <lb/>
            animals. The sexual intercourse of the younger horses takes <lb/>
            place before the usual age according to the goodness and <lb/>
            abundance of their food. The horse generally produces but <lb/>
            one colt, or sometimes two at the outside. The hemionus has <lb/>
            also been known to produce two, but this is considered extra­ <lb/>
            ordinary. The horse begins sexual intercourse at thirty <lb/>
            months old, so that it can produce proper colts when it has <lb/>
            done changing its teeth. Some have been known, they say, <lb/>
            to impregnate mares while changing their teeth, unless they <lb/>
            were naturally barren.</p>
          <p>2. The horse has forty teeth. It sheds its four first teeth <lb/>
            at thirty months old, two above and two below. A year <lb/>
            afterwards, it sheds four more in the same manner, two <lb/>
            above and two below. And again, at the end of the next <lb/>
            year, it sheds four more in the same manner. When it is <lb/>
            lour years and a half old, it sheds no more; and individuals <lb/>
            have been known to shed them all at first, and others that <pb n="170"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. VI.</note> <lb/>
            have shed them all in the last year. These circumstances <lb/>
            are rare, so that it usually happens that the horse is most <lb/>
            fit for sexual intercourse at four years and a half old. The <lb/>
            older horses are more full of semen, both the males and the <lb/>
            females, than younger ones. Horses will copulate both with <lb/>
            their dams and with their offspring ;and it is thought to be <lb/>
            a sign that the herd is complete, when they copulate with <lb/>
            their offspring. The Scythians ride upon their pregnant <lb/>
            mares when the embryo begins to turn in the uterus, and <lb/>
            say that it renders parturition more easy. All other quad­ <lb/>
            rupeds lie down in the act of parturition; wherefore their <lb/>
            young are always produced lying on their side; but when <lb/>
            the mare feels that the time for parturition is approaching, <lb/>
            she stands upright to part with her colt.</p>
          <p>3. Horses generally live eighteen or twenty years; some <lb/>
            live twenty-five or thirty years; but if they are carefully <lb/>
            treated, their life may be extended to fifty years. Thirty <lb/>
            years, however, is a very long life for the male, and twenty- <lb/>
            five for the female. Some have been known to live forty <lb/>
            years. Males live a shorter time than females, on account <lb/>
            of the act of sexual intercourse; and those that are brought <lb/>
            up separately longer than those which live in herds. Fe­ <lb/>
            males attain their proper length and height in five years; <lb/>
            the males in six. In six more years the fulness of body is <lb/>
            acquired, which continues till they are twenty years old. <lb/>
            The females attain perfection more rapidly than the males; <lb/>
            but in the uterus the males are the more rapidly developed. <lb/>
            This is also the case in the human subject. This also takes <lb/>
            place in those animals which produce several at a birth.</p>
          <p>4. They say that the mule sucks for six months, but the <lb/>
            mare will not permit it to come afterwards, because it <lb/>
            drags and hurts her. The horse sucks for a longer time. <lb/>
            The horse and the mule attain perfection after casting <lb/>
            their teeth; and when they have cast them all, it is not <lb/>
            easy to know their age. Wherefore they say that, before <lb/>
            casting its teeth, the horse has its mark, which it has not <lb/>
            afterwards. After the teeth have been changed, the age <lb/>
            is usually ascertained by the canine tooth; for that in <lb/>
            riding horses is generally worn down, for the bridle rubs <lb/>
            against it. In horses which have not been ridden, it is large <lb/>
            and not worn. In young horses it is small and sharp. <pb n="171"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin"> B. VI.] </note> 5. The male copulates at all seasons, and as long as he <lb/>
            lives ; the female also as long as she lives ; and at all seasons, <lb/>
            unless they have on a fastening or some other hindrance, no <lb/>
            peculiar time is appropriated for copulation in either sex, <lb/>
            for there is no period of coition when they cannot also bring <lb/>
            up their young. In Opus there was a horse in a herd <lb/>
            which engendered when he was forty years old; but it was <lb/>
            necessary to lift up his fore legs for him. Mares begin to <lb/>
            desire sexual intercourse in the spring ; and when the mare <lb/>
            has foaled, she does not become pregnant again immediately, <lb/>
            but waits for a time, and produces better foals at the end of <lb/>
            four or five years. It is quite necessary that she should <lb/>
            wait one year, and should pass through a fallow, as it were.</p>
          <p>6. The horse, then, bears young at intervals, as I have <lb/>
            observed; but the ass is not subject to intervals. Some <lb/>
            mares are quite barren, and others, though they conceive, <lb/>
            yet do not produce their young; and they give as a reason <lb/>
            for this, that upon dissection the foetus was found to contain <lb/>
            other reniform bodies round the kidneys, so that it appeared <lb/>
            to have four kidneys. As soon as the mare has foaled, she <lb/>
            eats the chorion, and bites from the head of her foal the <lb/>
            substance called hippomanes. In size this substance is <lb/>
            somewhat less than a dry fig. Its form is flat and round, <lb/>
            and its colour black. If any person is at hand to take it <lb/>
            before the mare, and she smells it, the scent renders her <lb/>
            wild and mad. For this reason it is sought after and col­ <lb/>
            lected by poisoners. If an ass copulates with a pregnant <lb/>
            mare, the pre-existing foetus is destroyed. Those who keep <lb/>
            herds of horses do not place a leader over them, as they do <lb/>
            over oxen, for they are not naturally stationary, but active <lb/>
            and wandering.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>1. THE male and female ass begin to copulate at thirty <lb/>
            months old, and shed their first teeth at the same period. <lb/>
            They lose their second pair of teeth six months afterwards, <lb/>
            and their third and fourth in the same way. These fourth <lb/>
            teeth are called the marking teeth. Sometimes the ass has <lb/>
            become pregnant and brought up its young at a year old. <lb/>
            The she ass parts with the semen after coition, if she is not <lb/>
            prevented; and therefore, immediately after coition, they <pb n="172"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VI. </note> <lb/>
            beat her and drive her about. She foals in the twelfth <lb/>
            month, and generally produces one foal, for this is their <lb/>
            nature, though cases of twin births have occurred. If an <lb/>
            ass mounts upon a mare, he destroys her foetus, as I observed <lb/>
            before. But the horse does not destroy the foetus of the <lb/>
            ass, if the mare has been impregnated by a he ass.</p>
          <p>2. The pregnant female has milk at the end of ten months. <lb/>
            After parturition, she will admit the male on the seventh <lb/>
            day, and is very easily impregnated at that period. She <lb/>
            will also receive it afterwards. If she does not produce <lb/>
            young before losing her marking teeth, she can never be <lb/>
            impregnated all the rest of her life. She does not like men <lb/>
            to be witnesses of her parturition, nor will she produce her <lb/>
            young in the day time; but when it is dark she retires, and <lb/>
            so produces her young. She continues to procreate during <lb/>
            her whole life, if she has begun before losing her marking <lb/>
            teeth. The ass lives more than thirty years, and the female <lb/>
            longer than the male. When a horse copulates with an ass, <lb/>
            or a he ass with a mare, abortion is more frequent than be­ <lb/>
            tween congeners, a horse with a mare, or two asses together. <lb/>
            When the horse and ass are mixed together, the period of <lb/>
            gestation follows from the male parent. I mean to say that <lb/>
            it takes the same time as if the parents had been congeners; <lb/>
            but in size, form, and strength the produce of their union <lb/>
            generally resembles the female parent.</p>
          <p>3. If the union takes place frequently, and sufficient time <lb/>
            is not allowed to intervene, the female soon becomes barren. <lb/>
            For which reason those who attend to this business do not <lb/>
            permit them to have continual intercourse, but interpose a <lb/>
            proper interval. The mare will not admit the he ass, nor <lb/>
            the she ass the horse, unless the he ass has been suckled by <lb/>
            a mare. They are careful, therefore, to admit only those <lb/>
            asses which they call hippothelæ, i.e. asses which have been <lb/>
            suckled by a mare. These copulate by force in the pastures, <lb/>
            like horses.</p>

          <p>1. THE oreus (mule) mounts and copulates after shedding <lb/>
            the first teeth, and when seven years old is able to engender; <lb/>
            and the ginnus is produced when be mounts upon a mare. <lb/>
            After this he no longer continues to copulate. The female <pb n="173"/>
            <note type="margin">B. VI.] </note> <lb/>
            oreus also has been impregnated, but the foetus has never <lb/>
            been known to come to maturity. The hemioni (female <lb/>
            mules) of Syria, near Pheenicia, admit the male and pro. <lb/>
            create. The kind, however, though similar, is not the same. <lb/>
            Those which are called ginni are produced from a mare, <lb/>
            when the foetus has received some injury in the uterus, like <lb/>
            dwarfs among men and metachoera among swine; and the <lb/>
            ginnus, like the dwarf, has a large genital organ.</p>
          <p>2. The hemionus has a long life; for they have been <lb/>
            known to live for eighty years, as in Athens, when they <lb/>
            built the temple, this individual, though failing with age, <lb/>
            helped in drawing, and went beside them, and encou­ <lb/>
            raged the yoke mules to their work, so that an edict was <lb/>
            made, commanding the corn-dealers not to drive it away <lb/>
            from the vessels filled with corn. The female mule (oreus) <lb/>
            grows old sooner than the male. Some persons say that she <lb/>
            is purified when making water, but the male ages more <lb/>
            rapidly from smelling the urine.</p>
          <p>3. This is the manner of the reproduction of these ani­ <lb/>
            mals. Those who are employed in bringing up these animals <lb/>
            recognize the young from the old in this way. If the skin, <lb/>
            when drawn back from the cheek, soon recovers its shape, <lb/>
            the animal is young; if the skin continues wrinkled for a <lb/>
            long while, the creature is aged..</p>

          <p>1. THE camel is pregnant ten months, and always produces <lb/>
            a single young one, for this is its nature. They separate <lb/>
            the young camel from the herd at a year old. The camel <lb/>
            will live more than fifty years. The season of parturition <lb/>
            is in the spring, and the female continues to give milk until <lb/>
            she conceives again. Their flesh and milk are exceedingly <lb/>
            sweet. The milk is drunk mixed with two or three times <lb/>
            its quantity of water.</p>
          <p>2. Elephants begin to copulate at twenty years old. When <lb/>
            the female is impregnated, her period of gestation, some per­ <lb/>
            sons say, is a year and a half; other people make it three <lb/>
            years. The difficulty of seeing their copulation causes this <lb/>
            difference of opinion respecting the period of gestation. The <lb/>
            female produces her young bending upon her haunches. <lb/>
            Her pain is evident. The calf, when it is born, sucks with <pb n="174"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. VI. </note> <lb/>
            its mouth, and not with its proboscis. It can walk and see <lb/>
            as soon as it is born.</p>
          <p>3. Wild swine copulate at the beginning of winter. They <lb/>
            produce their young in the spring. For this purpose the <lb/>
            female gets away into inaccessible and precipitous places, <lb/>
            where there are caves and plenty of shade. The males re­ <lb/>
            main with the females for thirty days. The number of pigs <lb/>
            and the period of gestation are the same as in the domesti­ <lb/>
            cated herd, and their voices are much alike: the female, <lb/>
            however, grunts more and the male less. The castration of <lb/>
            the male makes them larger and more fierce, as Homer <lb/>
            writes. " He brought up a castrated wild boar, which was not <lb/>
            like a beast fed upon food, but resembled a woody moun­ <lb/>
            tain peak." Castration takes place from a disease like a <lb/>
            swelling in the testicles, which they rub against the trees <lb/>
            and so destroy them.</p>

          <p>1. THE female deer usually copulates, as I observed before, <lb/>
            from allurement; for she cannot endure the male on account <lb/>
            of the hardness of the penis. Some, however, endure copu­ <lb/>
            lation as sheep do. When sexual desire is felt, they lie <lb/>
            down beside each other. The male is changeable in his dis­ <lb/>
            position, and does not unite himself to a single female, but <lb/>
            in a short time leaves one for another. The season for <lb/>
            sexual intercourse is in August and September, after Arctu­ <lb/>
            ruse The period of gestation is eight months. The female <lb/>
            becomes pregnant in a few days, and frequently in one day.</p>
          <p>2. She generally produces one fawn, though some have <lb/>
            been known to bear twins. She produces her young by the <lb/>
            road side, for fear of wild beasts. The growth of the fawns <lb/>
            is rapid. The female has no purification at other times, but <lb/>
            after parturition her cleansing is sanguineous. The female <lb/>
            usually conducts her fawn to some accustomed place, which <lb/>
            serves them for a refuge. It is usually an opening in a <lb/>
            rock, with but one entrance, where they can defend them­ <lb/>
            selves against those who would attack them.</p>
          <p>3. There are fables about their long life. They do not, <lb/>
            however, appear to be worthy of credit; and the period of <lb/>
            gestation and growth of the young does not agree with the <lb/>
            habits of long-lived animals. In the mountain called <unclear>El</unclear>&amp;- <pb n="175"/>
            <note type="margin">B. VI.] </note> <lb/>
            phoïs, in Arginusa, in Asia, where Alcibiades died, all the <lb/>
            deer have their ears divided, so that they can be known if <lb/>
            they migrate to another place, and even the foetus in utero <lb/>
            has this distinction. The females have four nipples, like <lb/>
            cows.</p>
          <p>4. As soon as the females are impregnated, the males go <lb/>
            and live apart from them, and, urged by their-sexual desires, <lb/>
            they each go apart and make a hole, in which they emit a <lb/>
            strong smell like he goats, and their faces become black, by <lb/>
            being sprinkled like those of goats. This continues till <lb/>
            after rain, when they turn again to their pasture. The <lb/>
            animal acts in this way on account of its violent sexual de­ <lb/>
            sires and its fatness. In summer time this is so great <lb/>
            that they cannot run, but are taken by those who pursue <lb/>
            them, even on foot, in the second or third race.</p>
          <p>5. They frequent the water both on account of the heat <lb/>
            and the difficulty of breathing. At the period of sexual <lb/>
            intercourse, their flesh is inferior both in taste and smell, <lb/>
            like that of he-goats. In winter they are thin and weak, <lb/>
            and in the spring are most active for the chase. When <lb/>
            chased, they sometimes rest awhile, and remain standing till <lb/>
            their pursuers come up with them, when they start afresh. <lb/>
            They seem to do this from a pain in their intestines; for <lb/>
            their viscera are so thin and weak that if they are only <lb/>
            struck gently they are ruptured, though the hide remains <lb/>
            sound.</p>

          <p>1. BEARS perform the act of sexual intercourse in the man­ <lb/>
            ner already described, not mounting upon each other, but <lb/>
            lying down upon the ground. The female is pregnant thirty <lb/>
            days, when she produces one or two, or at the outside five <lb/>
            cubs. The foetus is smaller, in proportion to the size of the <lb/>
            parent, than that of any other animal; for it is less than a <lb/>
            weasel, and greater than a mouse. It is without hair and <lb/>
            blind, and its legs and almost all its parts are without <lb/>
            joints. Its season of sexual intercourse is in March. <lb/>
            The cubs are born at the time of concealment. At this <lb/>
            season both the female and the male are very fat. When <lb/>
            they have brought up their young, they show themselves <lb/>
            in the third month of the spring. The porcupine also <pb n="176"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. VI. </note> <lb/>
            conceals itself, and is pregnant for the same number of <lb/>
            days, and in other respects resembles the bear. It is very <lb/>
            difficult to capture the she bear when pregnant.</p>

          <p>1. IT has already been observed that the lion both copulates <lb/>
            and makes water backwards. They do not copulate and <lb/>
            produce their young at all seasons of the year, though they <lb/>
            produce annually. The young are produced in the spring. <lb/>
            The female generally produces two, never more than six, <lb/>
            and sometimes only one. The fable which says that the <lb/>
            uterus is ejected in parturition is a mistake. It has arisen <lb/>
            from the rarity of the animal, those who invented the fable <lb/>
            being ignorant of the true state of the case. The race of <lb/>
            lions is rare, and not to be found in every place, but only in <lb/>
            the country between the Achelous and the Nessus in the <lb/>
            whole of Europe. The young of the lion are very small at <lb/>
            their birth, so that they can hardly walk at two months old. <lb/>
            The Syrian lions produce five times; at first five cubs, and <lb/>
            then one less every time. After this they produce no more, <lb/>
            but continue barren. The lioness has no mane, though the <lb/>
            lion has. The lion only sheds its four canine teeth, two <lb/>
            above and two below. They are shed when the animal is <lb/>
            six months old.</p>
          <p>2. The hyaena is of the colour of the wolf, but it is more <lb/>
            hairy, and has a mane along the ridge of its back. It is a <lb/>
            mistake to say that each individual has the sexual organs of <lb/>
            both sexes. That of the male resembles the same organ in <lb/>
            the wolf and the dog. That which has been imagined to be <lb/>
            the female organ is placed beneath the tail, and it resembles <lb/>
            that of the female, but is imperforate, and the anus is be­ <lb/>
            neath it. The female hyena has an organ similar to that <lb/>
            which bears its name in the male. It is placed beneath the <lb/>
            tail, and is imperforate. Beneath this is the anus, and below <lb/>
            this again the true genital organ. The female hyena has an <lb/>
            uterus like that of other animals of the class, but the female <lb/>
            is rarely captured. A certain hunter said that he caught <lb/>
            eleven hyænas of which only one was a female.</p>
          <p>3. Hares copulate backwards, as I formerly observed, for <lb/>
            it is a retromingent animal. They copulate and produce <pb n="177"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. VI.] </note> <lb/>
            their young at all seasons. They become pregnant a second <lb/>
            time while they are pregnant, and produce their young every <lb/>
            month. They do not produce their young continually, but <lb/>
            as many days as may be intervene. The female has milk <lb/>
            before the young are produced. As soon as her young are <lb/>
            born, she copulates again and conceives while giving milk. <lb/>
            The milk is as thick as that of the sow. The young are <lb/>
            born blind, like those of many animals with divided feet.</p>

          <p>1. THE fox copulates, mounting on the back of the female. <lb/>
            The young are born blind, like those of the bear, and are <lb/>
            even more inarticulate. When the season of parturition <lb/>
            approaches, the female goes apart, so that it is rare to take <lb/>
            a pregnant fox. When the young are born, the dam licks <lb/>
            them, in order to warm and mature them. She never pro. <lb/>
            duces more than four.</p>
          <p>2. The periods of gestation and parturition, both in point of <lb/>
            time and the number of the young, are the same in the wolf as <lb/>
            in the dog, and the young are blind, like those of the dog. <lb/>
            They copulate at one season of the year, and the young are <lb/>
            produced in the beginning of summer. A fabulous story <lb/>
            is told of their parturition; for they say that all the she <lb/>
            wolves produce their young in twelve days in the year; and <lb/>
            the reason which is given for this fable is this, that during this <lb/>
            number of days Latona was brought from the Hyperborean <lb/>
            regions to Delos, in the form of a wolf, for fear of Juno. <lb/>
            Whether this is or is not the period of parturition has never <lb/>
            yet been ascertained. At present it only rests upon tra­ <lb/>
            dition. It does not appear to be true, nor that other tale <lb/>
            which says that wolves only produce once in their life.</p>
          <p>3. Cats and ichneumons produce their young in the same <lb/>
            manner as dogs, and live upon the same things. They live <lb/>
            about six years. The young of the panther are born blind. <lb/>
            They are never more than four in number. The jackal <lb/>
            is impregnated like a bitch, and the young are born blind. <lb/>
            They produce two, or three, or four. Its length towards <lb/>
            the tail is great. Its height is small. It runs very swiftly, <lb/>
            although its legs are short; but on account of the softness <lb/>
            of its tissues it can leap a great distance.</p>
          <p>4. In Syria there are animals called hemioni which are <note type="footnote"> N </note> <pb n="178"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VI. </note> <lb/>
            different from those derived from a mixture of the horse and <lb/>
            ass, though they resemble them in appearance. As the wild <lb/>
            ass is named from its resemblance to the domestic kind, the <lb/>
            wild asses and the hemioni differ from the domestic race in <lb/>
            speed. These hemioni are derived from their own congeners, <lb/>
            of which this is a proof. For some came to Phrygia in the <lb/>
            time of Pharnaces, the father of Pharnabazus, and remain <lb/>
            there still. There are now only three, though they say that <lb/>
            at first there were nine.</p>

          <p>1. THE reproduction of mice is more wonderful than that <lb/>
            of any other animal, both in number and rapidity. For a <lb/>
            pregnant female was left in a vessel of corn; and after a <lb/>
            short time the vessel was opened, and a hundred and twenty <lb/>
            mice were counted. There is a doubt respecting the re­ <lb/>
            production and destruction of the mice which live on the <lb/>
            ground; for such an inexpressible number of field mice have <lb/>
            sometimes made their appearance that very little food re­ <lb/>
            mained. Their power of destruction also is so great that <lb/>
            some small farmers, having on one day observed that their <lb/>
            corn was ready for harvest, when they went the following <lb/>
            day to cut their corn, found it all eaten.</p>
          <p>2. The manner of their disappearance also is unac­ <lb/>
            countable ; for in a few days they all vanish, although be­ <lb/>
            forehand they could not be exterminated by smoking and <lb/>
            digging them out, nor by hunting them and turning swine <lb/>
            among them to root up their runs. Foxes also hunt them <lb/>
            out, and wild weasels1 are very ready to destroy them; but <lb/>
            they cannot prevail over their numbers and the rapidity of <lb/>
            their increase, nor indeed can anything prevail over them <lb/>
            but rain, and when this comes they disappear very soon.</p>
          <p>3. In a certain part of Persia the female foetus of the mice <lb/>
            are found to be pregnant in the uterus of their parent. <lb/>
            Some people say and affirm that if they lick salt they become <lb/>
            pregnant without copulation. The Egyptian mice have hair <lb/>
            nearly resembling that of the hedgehog. There are other <lb/>
            kinds which go upon two feet, for their fore feet are small <lb/>
            and their hind feet larger They are very numerous. There <lb/>
            are also many other kinds of mice. <note type="footnote"> 1 Perhaps ferret, Mustela varo, or weasel. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Serboa, Dipus gerbillus, or D. jaculus. </note> <pb n="179"/>

          <p>1. THE circumstances attending on the growth of man, from <lb/>
            his conception in the womb even to old age, derived from his <lb/>
            peculiar nature, are after this manner. We have already <lb/>
            treated of the distinctions of the male and female and their <lb/>
            parts. The male begins to have semen at about the age of <lb/>
            fourteen complete. At the same time hair begins to appear on <lb/>
            the pubes. As Alcmæon of Crotona says that flowers blossom <lb/>
            before they bear seed, about the same period the voice begins <lb/>
            to become more harsh and irregular. It is neither quite <lb/>
            harsh, nor deep, nor all alike, but it resembles a discordant <lb/>
            and harsh instrument. This is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταγίξειν</foreign>, to have a <lb/>
            voice like a goat.</p>
          <p>2. This is more conspicuous in those who attempt the <lb/>
            gratification of sexual desires; for those who are vehement <lb/>
            in these desires rapidly pass into a man's voice. In those <lb/>
            that refrain themselves the contrary occurs. In those who, <lb/>
            like some singers, endeavour to avoid this change, the voice <lb/>
            will continue for a long while, and never undergo any great <lb/>
            change. The breasts also and pudendum not only increase <lb/>
            in size, but their general appearance is changed. At this <lb/>
            period of life, if a person is urged to the emission of semen, <lb/>
            the discharge is accompanied with pain as well as pleasure.</p>
          <p>3. About the same period also the breasts of females en­ <lb/>
            large, and the catamenia make their appearance. They re­ <lb/>
            semble the blood of a newly killed animal. In young girls <lb/>
            only do they appear white, especially if they make use of <lb/>
            fluid food. This complaint stops the growth and weakens <lb/>
            the body of girls. The catamenia usually appear when the <lb/>
            mammæ are about two fingers high. The voice of girls also <lb/>
            becomes deeper at this period, for on the whole the voice of <lb/>
            women is more acute than that of men, and the voice of <lb/>
            girls than that of old women, as the voice of boys is more <note type="footnote">or 2 </note> <pb n="180"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. VII.</note> <lb/>
            acute than the voice of men. The voice of female children <lb/>
            also is more acute than that of males, and the windpipe is <lb/>
            more acute in girls than boys.</p>
          <p>4. They also want especial care at this period, for their <lb/>
            sexual desires are very strong at the commencement, so <lb/>
            that if they now take care to avoid every excitement, except <lb/>
            such as the change of their body requires, without using <lb/>
            venery, they generally remain temperate in after-years. For <lb/>
            girls who indulge in venery when young, generally grow up <lb/>
            intemperate; and so do males if they are unguarded either <lb/>
            one way or both ways; for at this age the ducts open, and <lb/>
            afford an easy passage for the fluid through the body, and <lb/>
            at the same time the memory of past pleasures causes a <lb/>
            desire for present gratification.</p>
          <p>5. Some men never have hair on the pubes from their <lb/>
            birth, nor seed, on account of the destruction of the parts <lb/>
            appropriated to the semen. There are some women also <lb/>
            who never have hair on the pubes. The male and female <lb/>
            also change their habits of sickness and of health, and <lb/>
            the proportions of their body, whether slight or stout, <lb/>
            or of a good habit. Some thin boys after they attain <lb/>
            puberty become stout and healthy, in others the contrary <lb/>
            takes place. This is the case also with females; for whe­ <lb/>
            ther boys or girls have their bodies loaded with excre­ <lb/>
            mentitious matter, this is separated in the one by puberty, <lb/>
            in the other by the catamenia. They become more healthy <lb/>
            and thriving when that which had prevented health and <lb/>
            growth is removed.</p>
          <p>6. Those which are of the contrary habit of body become <lb/>
            more thin and delicate; for their naturally healthy condi­ <lb/>
            tion is separated in the puberty of one sex, and the cata­ <lb/>
            menia of the other. There is also considerable variety in <lb/>
            the bosoms of young girls, for in some they are very large, <lb/>
            in others small. This generally takes place in those girls <lb/>
            which have much superfluous humour, for when the cata­ <lb/>
            menia are about to appear, but before they arrive, the more <lb/>
            fluid the patient is, the more necessary it is that the breasts <lb/>
            should increase until the catamenia make their appearance, <lb/>
            and the breasts, which then begin to increase, remain so after­ <lb/>
            wards. In youths and aged men the breasts are more con­ <lb/>
            spicuous, and more like those of females; and in those who <pb n="181"/>
            <note type="margin">B. VII.] </note> <lb/>
            are of a soft habit of body, and are smooth and not full of <lb/>
            veins, and in dark persons also more than fair ones.</p>
          <p>7. Until twenty-one years of age the semen is unpro­ <lb/>
            ductive, afterwards it becomes fertile, though boys and girls <lb/>
            produce small and imperfect children: this is also the case <lb/>
            with other animals. Young girls conceive more readily, <lb/>
            but after conception suffer more in parturition, and their <lb/>
            bodies frequently become imperfect. Men of violent pas­ <lb/>
            sions, and women that have borne many children, grow old <lb/>
            more rapidly than others ; nor does there appear to be any <lb/>
            increase after they have borne three children. Women of <lb/>
            violent sexual desires become more temperate after they <lb/>
            have borne several children.</p>
          <p>8. Women who have attained thrice seven years are well <lb/>
            adapted for child-bearing, and men also are capable of be­ <lb/>
            coming parents. Thin seminal fluid is barren. That which <lb/>
            is lumpy begets males; what is thin and not clotted, females. <lb/>
            The beard also appears on the chin of men at the same <lb/>
            period.</p>

          <p>1. THE catamenia appear when the moon is on the wane, from <lb/>
            which some persons would argue that the moon is a female, <lb/>
            for the purification of women and the waning of the moon <lb/>
            occur together, and repletion occurs again in both after the <lb/>
            purification and waning. In few women the catamenia <lb/>
            occur every month, but in most at every third month. <lb/>
            Those in whom they continue for only two or three days <lb/>
            escape with ease: it is more difficult for those in whom <lb/>
            it continues for a longer time, for they suffer during the <lb/>
            whole period. In some the purification takes place all at <lb/>
            once, in others by degrees ; in all, however, the pain is con­ <lb/>
            siderable as long as they are present. In many wo­ <lb/>
            men, when the catamenia are nearly ready to appear, the <lb/>
            womb suffers so much from strangulation and disturbance, <lb/>
            until they are discharged.</p>
          <p>2. Conception naturally takes place immediately after <lb/>
            this discharge in women, and those who do not then con­ <lb/>
            ceive, are usually barren. Some women, however, who <lb/>
            have never menstruated, conceive. Such persons contain <lb/>
            in themselves as much of the fluid as is usually left behind <pb n="182"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. VII.</note> <lb/>
            after the purification, but not so much as to make its ap­ <lb/>
            pearance externally. Some women in whom the uterus has <lb/>
            closed immediately after the purification, conceive even while <lb/>
            menstruating, but do not conceive afterwards. The cata­ <lb/>
            menia sometimes occur even in pregnant women. Such <lb/>
            women usually bear imperfect children, and their offspring <lb/>
            either do not grow up, or are weakly.</p>
          <p>3. It frequently happens that from the want of sexual <lb/>
            intercourse, or from youth and the period of life, or from <lb/>
            long abstinence, the uterus descends, and the catamenia <lb/>
            occur several times in the month, until they conceive; after <lb/>
            which the parts return to their proper place: and sometimes <lb/>
            even in women with a good habit of body, if the humours <lb/>
            are abundant, an effusion of the semen takes place if it is <lb/>
            too moist.</p>
          <p>4. It has already been observed that this purification is <lb/>
            more abundant in women than in any other creature. In <lb/>
            animals that are not viviparous no symptoms of anything of <lb/>
            the kind occur, for this superfluous matter is returned into <lb/>
            their own body, for in many the females are superior to the <lb/>
            males in size, and in many it is turned to the formation of <lb/>
            plates, or scales, or abundance of feathers. In viviparous ani­ <lb/>
            mals with feet, it is turned to the formation of hair and bulk <lb/>
            of body (for man is the only animal that is smooth), or of <lb/>
            urine; for in almost all animals this secretion is thick and <lb/>
            abundant. In women, on the contrary, all the superfluous <lb/>
            matter of the body is directed to this purification.</p>
          <p>5. The case of the male is the same, for in proportion to <lb/>
            his size, man emits more semen than other animals ; (where­ <lb/>
            fore, also, man is the smoothest of all animals,) and among <lb/>
            men those which abound in humours, and are not very full <lb/>
            fleshed, and fair men more than dark ones. So also among <lb/>
            women. For in those that are full fleshed, the greater part <lb/>
            of the secretion goes to the supply of the body, and in the <lb/>
            act of sexual intercourse, fair women have naturally more <lb/>
            seminal fluid than dark ones. Liquid and acid foods also <lb/>
            increase this kind of intercourse.</p>

          <p>1. It is a sign that women have conceived when the puden. <lb/>
            dum remains dry after coition. If the labia are smooth they <pb n="183"/>
            <note type="margin">B. VII.] </note> <lb/>
            will not conceive, for it slips out; nor will they if the labia <lb/>
            are thick: but if there is a sensation of roughness and re­ <lb/>
            sistance when touched with the finger, and the labia are <lb/>
            thin, they are then adapted for conception. In order that <lb/>
            they may be able to conceive, such women must prepare the <lb/>
            uterus, and the contrary that they may not conceive; for <lb/>
            if the labia are smooth they do not conceive: so that some <lb/>
            women, in order that the semen may fall outside the uterus, <lb/>
            anoint themselves with oil of cedar, or with ceruse, or oil <lb/>
            mixed with frankincense.</p>
          <p>2. If it remain seven days, it is evident that conception <lb/>
            has taken place, for in this period what are called the out­ <lb/>
            pourings take place. The purification takes place in many <lb/>
            women after conception. Thirty days afterwards in the <lb/>
            case of conceiving a female child, and forty in the case of <lb/>
            a male. After parturition, also, the purification lasts a simi­ <lb/>
            lar number of days, though it is not exactly the same in all.</p>
          <p>3. In the same number of days after conception the dis­ <lb/>
            charge no longer takes its usual course, but is turned towards <lb/>
            the mammæ, in which the milk begins to make its appearance. <lb/>
            At first the milk appears very small, and like a web in the <lb/>
            mammæ. After conception, the first sensation generally <lb/>
            takes place in the iliac region, which immediately appears <lb/>
            more full in some persons. This is more conspicuous in <lb/>
            slight persons. If the child is a male, a movement is usually <lb/>
            felt on the right side of the groin, in about forty days ; if a <lb/>
            female, the movement occurs on the left side, in about <lb/>
            ninety days. We must not suppose, however, that an accu­ <lb/>
            rate judgment can be formed in this way, for it often happens <lb/>
            that the movement is felt on the right side when a female <lb/>
            child, and on the left when a male child is conceived. All <lb/>
            these, and such like things, vary in a greater or less degree.</p>
          <p>4. About this period, also, the foetus becomes divided ; it <lb/>
            previously existed as an undivided mass of flesh. If it pe­ <lb/>
            rishes within seven days, it is called an effluxion; if in <lb/>
            forty days, an abortion. The foetus often perishes within <lb/>
            this period. If the male foetus is excluded within forty <lb/>
            days, and is put out into any other fluid, it becomes dis­ <lb/>
            solved, and disappears. If placed in cold water, it becomes, <lb/>
            as it were, surrounded with a membrane. When this is <lb/>
            taken off, the foetus appears about as large as a large <pb n="184"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. VII.</note> <lb/>
            ant. Its parts are visible, both those of generation, and all <lb/>
            the rest; and the eyes are very large, as in other animals. <lb/>
            If the female foetus perishes within the three months, it <lb/>
            generally appears without divisions. If it survives to the <lb/>
            fourth month, the parts appear formed.</p>
          <p>5. The whole completion of the parts is more slow in the <lb/>
            female than in the male, and parturition is more frequently <lb/>
            delayed to the tenth month. After birth, females attain to <lb/>
            youth, and puberty, and old age, more rapidly than males, <lb/>
            and those that have borne many children more rapidly than <lb/>
            others, as it was observed before.</p>

          <p>1. WHEN conception has taken place, the uterus usually <lb/>
            closes immediately for seven months. In the eighth month it <lb/>
            opens, and the foetus, if properly developed, begins to descend <lb/>
            in the eighth month. If the foetus is not properly deve­ <lb/>
            loped, but checked in the eighth month in parturition, <lb/>
            women who bear in the eighth month do not exclude it, nor <lb/>
            does the foetus advance downwards in the eighth month, <lb/>
            and the uterus does not open itself. It is a sign that it is <lb/>
            not properly developed, when it is born before the circum. <lb/>
            stances I have described take place.</p>
          <p>2. After conception, women suffer throughout their whole <lb/>
            body, and their sight becomes dim, and they are afflicted <lb/>
            with headache. In some, these symptoms occur very soon, <lb/>
            as early as the tenth day; in others they are delayed, in <lb/>
            proportion as they have an abundance or deficiency of super­ <lb/>
            fluous matter in their bodies. Nausea and vomiting often <lb/>
            seize upon them, and on those especially in whom the puri­ <lb/>
            fications become stagnant, and do not yet fly to the mammæ. <lb/>
            Some women suffer at the commencement of pregnancy, and <lb/>
            others in the more advanced stages, when the foetus be­ <lb/>
            gins to grow. Retention of urine also frequently attacks <lb/>
            them at last.</p>
          <p>3. Those that are pregnant with a male foetus, usually <lb/>
            pass through the time more easily, and retain a better <lb/>
            colour throughout. If a female is conceived, the contrary is <lb/>
            the case; for they are generally more discoloured, and <lb/>
            suffer more during the period of gestation. In many cases <lb/>
            the legs swell, and a swollen condition of the flesh is also corn- <pb n="185"/>
            <note type="margin">B. VII ] </note> <lb/>
            mon. In some women, however, the condition is contrary. <lb/>
            Pregnant women are apt to have all sorts of fancies, which <lb/>
            change very rapidly. Some persons call this longing. <lb/>
            These fancies are strongest when a female is conceived, and <lb/>
            there is but little pleasure in their gratification. In a few <lb/>
            women the condition of the body is better during preg­ <lb/>
            nancy ; they suffer most when the hair of the foetus begins <lb/>
            to grow. Pregnant women lose the hair which grows on <lb/>
            the parts that are hairy at birth, while it becomes more <lb/>
            thick upon the parts on which it appears subsequent to <lb/>
            birth.</p>
          <p>4. A male foetus usually moves more freely in the womb <lb/>
            than a female, and the parturition is not so long. If a fe­ <lb/>
            male, the parturition is slower. The pain in the birth of <lb/>
            female children is continuous, and dull; in the birth of <lb/>
            males it is sharp, and far more severe. Those who, before <lb/>
            parturition, have sexual intercourse, suffer less in the pro­ <lb/>
            cess. Sometimes women seem to suffer, not from any pain <lb/>
            of their own, but from the turning of the head of the child; <lb/>
            and this appears to be the commencement of the pain. <lb/>
            Other animals have a single exact period for parturition, <lb/>
            for one time is appointed for them all. The human subject <lb/>
            alone varies in this particular, for the period of gestation is <lb/>
            seven, eight, or nine months, or ten at the outside, though <lb/>
            some have even advanced as far as the eleventh month.</p>
          <p>5. If any are born before the seventh month, they never <lb/>
            live. Those of seven months are the first that are developed, <lb/>
            but these are usually weakly, wherefore, also, they wrap <lb/>
            them in wool. Many of these infants have the passages, <lb/>
            as the ears and nostrils, imperforate. As they grow, how­ <lb/>
            ever, they assume a proper form, and many of them survive. <lb/>
            In Egypt, and some other places, where the women suffer <lb/>
            little pain in parturition, and where they bear many chil­ <lb/>
            dren with ease, those even at the end of eight months are <lb/>
            capable of living, even although they should be monstrous; <lb/>
            but in such places children born in the eighth month may <lb/>
            survive and be brought up. In Greece, however, few of <lb/>
            them survive, and most of them perish; and people suspect <lb/>
            that if any of them survive, the exact period of conception <lb/>
            must have been mistaken by the mother.</p>
          <p>6. Women suffer most in the fourth and eighth mouth, <pb n="186"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. VII. </note> <lb/>
            and if the foetus dies in the fourth or eighth month, they <lb/>
            usually die also; so that not only children born in the eighth <lb/>
            month often perish, but their mothers also perish with them. <lb/>
            In the same way, the period of conception probably is mistaken <lb/>
            by those who have been pregnant more than eleven months ; <lb/>
            for in these cases the beginning of the conception escapes <lb/>
            the notice of females, for frequently after the uterus has <lb/>
            been distended with flatulence, women have copulated and <lb/>
            conceived, and supposed that the former condition in which <lb/>
            they observed the usual symptoms, was the commencement <lb/>
            of gestation.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER V.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. THE human subject also differs from other animals, as <lb/>
            to the number of the perfect offspring produced at a birth. <lb/>
            For the human subject differs both from animals which <lb/>
            produce but one, and those which produce many; for, <lb/>
            generally speaking, and, in most cases, women have but <lb/>
            one child at a time, though cases of twins occur frequently, <lb/>
            and in many places, as in Egypt, three or four at a <lb/>
            birth have been known in some particular places, as I <lb/>
            have observed before. Five at a birth are the most that have <lb/>
            been produced. This has been observed to take place in <lb/>
            many cases, but in one case only have twenty been pro. <lb/>
            duced at four births, for five were born each time, and many <lb/>
            of them were reared. In other animals, if the twins are <lb/>
            male and female, there is no more difficulty in rearing and <lb/>
            preserving them, than if they were both of the same sex. <lb/>
            In the human subject there are few cases of twins surviving, <lb/>
            when one was male and the other female.</p>
          <p>2. The human female and the mare copulate after con­ <lb/>
            ception more than any other creatures, for all other females, <lb/>
            when they have conceived, By from the males, except those <lb/>
            which, like the hare, become pregnant a second time during <lb/>
            gestation. But the mare, having once conceived, does not <lb/>
            form a second foetus, but generally produces a single foal. <lb/>
            In the human subject it happens sometimes, though rarely. <lb/>
            Those which are conceived a long while afterwards never <lb/>
            come to perfection, but, from the pain which they cause, <lb/>
            destroy the original foetus; and a case has occurred in <lb/>
            which twelve imperfect embryos have been produced at <pb n="187"/>
            <note type="margin">B. VII.] </note> <lb/>
            one time. If the second conception take place soon after <lb/>
            the first, they bear and produce the foetus, as if it were a <lb/>
            twin. This, they say, was the case with Iphicles and Her­ <lb/>
            cules.</p>
          <p>3. The possibility of the case is manifest, for an adulteress <lb/>
            has been known to produce one child like her husband, and <lb/>
            another like her paramour; and a case has occurred of a <lb/>
            woman having conceived twins, and then conceived a third <lb/>
            child upon them; and when the proper time came, the <lb/>
            twins were born perfect, the other was only a foetus of five <lb/>
            months old, which died immediately: and in another case, <lb/>
            a woman produced, first of all, a foetus of seven months old, <lb/>
            and then twins, perfectly developed; the former perished, <lb/>
            but the latter survived. And some women have conceived <lb/>
            at the same time as they miscarried, and have ejected <lb/>
            one foetus while they bore the other. In most females, <lb/>
            who have cohabited after the eighth month after conception, <lb/>
            the child has been born filled with a shining mucous-like <lb/>
            substance, and has often appeared full of the food which has <lb/>
            been eaten by the mother; and if she has fed upon food <lb/>
            more than usually salt, the child has been born without nails.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER VI.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. THE milk that is produced before the seventh month is <lb/>
            useless; but as soon as the child is alive the milk be. <lb/>
            comes good. At first it is salt, like that of sheep. Most <lb/>
            women during pregnancy are affected by wine, and if <lb/>
            they drink it they become faint and feeble. The begin­ <lb/>
            ning and the ending of the reproductive power in both <lb/>
            sexes is marked in the male by the emission of the <lb/>
            semen, in the female by the catamenia. They are not, how­ <lb/>
            ever, fertile when these first occur, nor while they are <lb/>
            still small and weak. The period of the commencement <lb/>
            of these signs has been mentioned. In women the cata­ <lb/>
            menia usually cease at forty; but if they pass over this age, <lb/>
            they go on to fifty; and some have even produced children <lb/>
            at that period, but none later than this period.</p>
          <p>2. The reproductive function in men usually continues <lb/>
            active till they are sixty years old; if they pass beyond this <lb/>
            period, till they are seventy; and some men have bad chil­ <lb/>
            dren at seventy years old. It frequently happens that, when <pb n="188"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. VII. </note> <lb/>
            marriages are unfruitful, both men and women become preg­ <lb/>
            nant, if the marriage is dissolved and they marry again. The <lb/>
            same thing takes place respecting the birth of male and <lb/>
            female children. For sometimes only children of one sex <lb/>
            are produced by a marriage; and if this is dissolved, and the <lb/>
            parents marry again, children of the other sex are produced., <lb/>
            These things also vary with the age of the parents; for <lb/>
            some when young have female children, and when older <lb/>
            males, though the contrary sometimes takes place.</p>
          <p>3. The same is the case with the whole of the reproductive <lb/>
            function. For some persons have no children when they <lb/>
            are young, but have them afterwards; others have children <lb/>
            at first, but none afterwards; and there are some women <lb/>
            who conceive with difficulty, but when they have conceived <lb/>
            bear children; others conceive easily, but the foetus never <lb/>
            comes to maturity. There are also both men and women <lb/>
            who only produce children of one sex, as the story goes of <lb/>
            Hercules, who had but one daughter in seventy-two children. <lb/>
            Those who have been barren, and either after great care, or <lb/>
            from any other cause, at last conceive, more frequently <lb/>
            bear a daughter than a son. It often happens also that men <lb/>
            who have engendered become impotent, and subsequently <lb/>
            return to their former condition.</p>
          <p>4. Maimed parents produce maimed children; and so also <lb/>
            lame and blind parents produce lame and blind children; and, <lb/>
            on the whole, children are often born with anything contrary <lb/>
            to nature, or any mark which their parents may have, such as <lb/>
            tumours and wounds. Such marks have often been handed <lb/>
            down for three generations; as if a person had a mark on <lb/>
            their arm which was not seen in the son, but the grandson <lb/>
            exhibited a dark confused spot on the same place. The <lb/>
            circumstances, however, are rare; and sound children are <lb/>
            generally produced from lame parents; nor is there any com­ <lb/>
            plete certainty in these matters ; and children resemble <lb/>
            their parents or their grandparents, and sometimes they <lb/>
            resemble neither. This is handed down for many gene­ <lb/>
            rations ; as in Sicily, a woman cohabited with an Ethiopian, <lb/>
            her daughter was not black, but her daughters child was so.</p>
          <p>5. For the most part the girls resemble their mother, and <lb/>
            the boys their father; though the contrary is often the case, <lb/>
            and the females resemble their father, and the males their <pb n="189"/>
            <note type="margin">B. VII.] </note> <lb/>
            mother, and the different parts of the body resemble either <lb/>
            parents. Twins have sometimes no resemblance to each other, <lb/>
            but they are generally much alike; and one woman coha­ <lb/>
            bited with a man, and conceived seven days after parturi­ <lb/>
            tion, when she bore a child as like her former as if they had <lb/>
            been twins. Some women, as well as other creatures, pro­ <lb/>
            duce young resembling themselves, others bear those which <lb/>
            resemble the male, as the horse called Dicæa in Pharsalia.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>1. THE seminal fluid in its emission is preceded by wind. <lb/>
            The manner of its emission exhibits this; for nothing is <lb/>
            expelled to a great distance without pneumatic force. If the <lb/>
            seminal fluid is taken up by the uterus and retained there, <lb/>
            it becomes inclosed in a membrane. For if it is expelled <lb/>
            before it becomes articulated, it appears like an ovum inclosed <lb/>
            in a membrane, but without any shell, and the membrane is <lb/>
            full of veins. All animals, whether furnished with fins, feet, <lb/>
            or wings, whether viviparous or oviparous, are produced in <lb/>
            the same manner, except that the umbilicus in viviparous <lb/>
            animals is turned towards the uterus, and in others to the <lb/>
            ovum; and in some cases both ways, as in a certain kind of fish. <lb/>
            Some of them are surrounded by a membrane, others by a <lb/>
            chorion. First of all, the foetus is contained within the last <lb/>
            envelope. Then there is another membrane over this, which <lb/>
            is in part united to the matrix and is partly separate, and <lb/>
            contains water. Between these is a watery or sanguineous <lb/>
            fluid, which in women is called prophorus.</p>
          <p>2. All animals that have a navel increase by the navel ; <lb/>
            and in those which have acetabula the navel is united to the <lb/>
            acetabulum; and in those which have a smooth uterus the <lb/>
            navel is united to the uterus upon a vein. The position of all <lb/>
            quadrupeds in the uterus is stretched out; that of fishes is on <lb/>
            the side; bipeds, as birds, are folded together. The human <lb/>
            foetus lies folded up with its nose between its knees and its <lb/>
            eyes upon them, and its ears turned outwards. All animals are <lb/>
            alike in having the head placed upwards at first. As they <lb/>
            grow, the head turns round, and the birth of all animals is <lb/>
            naturally with the head forwards ; for even in those that are <lb/>
            folded together the presentation of the feet is unnatural. <lb/>
            The embryo of quadrupeds contains excrementitious matter, <pb n="190"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. VII </note> <lb/>
            as soon as it is matured, both fluid and solid. The latter is <lb/>
            contained in the extreme parts of the intestine, the former <lb/>
            in the bladder.</p>
          <p>3. If animals have acetabula in the uterus, these aceta­ <lb/>
            bula always become smaller as the foetus grows, and at <lb/>
            last disappear. The umbilical cord is a covering for veins, <lb/>
            of which the origin is in the uterus. In those crea <lb/>
            tures which have acetabula it originates in them; in those <lb/>
            that have not acetabula it originates in the vein. In the <lb/>
            larger animals, such as the foetus of oxen, there are four <lb/>
            veins; in smaller animals, two; in very small animals, as in <lb/>
            birds, there is but one. Two veins reach the foetus through <lb/>
            the liver, from that part called the gates of the liver, towards <lb/>
            the great vein; and two go to the aorta, where it is divided <lb/>
            into two parts; and there are membranes round each pair <lb/>
            of veins, and the umbilical cord surrounds these membranes <lb/>
            like a covering. As the foetus increases, these veins diminish. <lb/>
            The embryo, as it grows, advances into the viscera, where <lb/>
            its movements are manifest. Sometimes it remains rolled <lb/>
            up near the pudendum.</p>

          <p>1. WHEN the pains of parturition come on, they extend to <lb/>
            many and various parts of the body, but especially to one or <lb/>
            other of the thighs. Those who suffer most in the bowels are <lb/>
            delivered most rapidly; those who suffer much in the loins <lb/>
            are delivered with difficulty; those whose pain lies in the <lb/>
            subumbilical region, more quickly. If the child is a male, <lb/>
            a liquid, serum-like discharge, of a pale yellow colour, pre­ <lb/>
            cedes ; if a female, this discharge is sanguineous, but still <lb/>
            fluid. Some women have neither during the period of par­ <lb/>
            turition.</p>
          <p>2. In other animals parturition is not painful, and it is <lb/>
            evident that they suffer but moderately in the pains of <lb/>
            labour. In women the pains of parturition are more violent, <lb/>
            especially in those that are inactive or that are not well made <lb/>
            in their sides, and are unable to hold their breath. They <lb/>
            also suffer more in parturition, if they breathe in the mean­ <lb/>
            time, compelled by the necessity of respiration. At first a <lb/>
            fluid escapes when the foetus comes to the birth, and the mem- <pb n="191"/>
            <note type="margin">B. VII.] </note> <lb/>
            branes are ruptured; after this, the embryo is excluded, the <lb/>
            uterus being turned, and the uterus being turned inside-out.</p>

          <p>1. THE division of the umbilical cord often requires the care­ <lb/>
            ful attention of the midwife ; for by skilfulness she may not <lb/>
            only assist in difficult labours, but should attend carefully <lb/>
            to the circumstances, and apply the ligature to the umbilical <lb/>
            cord of the child; for if the secundines fall out with the <lb/>
            child, the umbilical cord must be bound with a ligature of <lb/>
            worsted, and cut above the ligature, and where it is bound <lb/>
            it joins together, and that which is joined with it falls off. <lb/>
            If the ligature becomes loose, the child dies from loss of <lb/>
            blood. If the secundines do not come out at once, while <lb/>
            they remain within, and the child is outside, the umbilical <lb/>
            cord must be tied and divided.</p>
          <p>2. Frequently the child, if weak, has appeared as if born <lb/>
            dead, until the umbilical cord was tied, for the blood flowed <lb/>
            from the child to the navel and the surrounding parts; but <lb/>
            some skilful midwife being present, by pressure on the navel <lb/>
            from within has revived the child, just as if it had been filled <lb/>
            with blood from the first. It has been already observed, that <lb/>
            all animals are naturally born with the head forwards. Chil­ <lb/>
            dren also have their hands pressed down against their sides. <lb/>
            As soon as they are born they begin to cry and bring their <lb/>
            hands to their mouth. They emit excrements, some imme­ <lb/>
            diately, others very soon, but all in the course of a day. This <lb/>
            excrementitious matter is very abundant, considering the size <lb/>
            of the child. Women call it the meconium. Its colour is like <lb/>
            that of blood, and it is black and pitch-like. Afterwards it <lb/>
            becomes milky, for the child immediately draws the breast. <lb/>
            The child never cries before it is entirely in the world, not <lb/>
            even though its head is protruded in difficult cases, while <lb/>
            the body is within the uterus.</p>
          <p>3. Those women in whom a flooding has preceded the <lb/>
            period of delivery are delivered with more difficulty, and if <lb/>
            the purifications are small after parturition, and only as much <lb/>
            as they are at first, and do not continue for more than forty <lb/>
            days, such women are stronger, and more ready for conception. <lb/>
            After children are born, for forty days they neither laugh <lb/>
            nor weep when awake, but sometimes do both in their sleep ; <pb n="192"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. VII.</note> <lb/>
            nor do they usually feel when they are tickled, but they sleep <lb/>
            the greater part of their time. As they grow, the period ot <lb/>
            wakefulness continually increases; and it is evident that they <lb/>
            dream, but it is some time before they remember their imagi­ <lb/>
            nations. There is no difference in the bones of other ani­ <lb/>
            mals, but they are all born perfect. In children the bone <lb/>
            called bregma is soft, and does not become strong for some <lb/>
            time. Some animals are born with teeth, but children begin <lb/>
            to cut their teeth in the seventh month. The front teeth <lb/>
            naturally appear first, sometimes the upper teeth and some­ <lb/>
            times the under. Children cut their teeth more easily if <lb/>
            their nurses have warmer milk.</p>

          <p>AFTER parturition and purification women become full <lb/>
            of milk; and in some it not only flows through the nipples <lb/>
            but through other parts of the breast, and sometimes from <lb/>
            the cheeks; and if this fluid is not matured nor secreted, <lb/>
            but remains full, hard knots are formed, which remain for <lb/>
            a long time; for every part of the breast is so spongy that, <lb/>
            if a hair is swallowed with the drink, pain ensues in the <lb/>
            breasts, until it either escapes spontaneously with the milk, <lb/>
            or is sucked out, this is called They continue to <lb/>
            have milk until they conceive again. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τιχιᾷν</foreign>. It then ceases, and <lb/>
            is quenched in other creatures as well as in the human <lb/>
            subject. The catamenia seldom take place while milk is <lb/>
            secreted, though this sometimes occurs in women while <lb/>
            nursing. On the whole, an effusion of fluid seldom takes <lb/>
            place from many parts of the body at the same time, and <lb/>
            those that have haemorrhoids have usually less purifica­ <lb/>
            tion. In some it takes place through ixiæ (varices), and <lb/>
            is secreted from the loins before it reaches the uterus; and <lb/>
            those who vomit blood when the purification is suppressed <lb/>
            suffer no harm.</p>

          <p>CHILDREN are very subject to spasms, and especially those <lb/>
            that are in a good condition and have abundance of rich <lb/>
            milk, or whose nurses are fat. Wine is injurious in this <lb/>
            complaint, and dark-coloured wines more so than those that <lb/>
            are pale, and food that is not fluid, and windy aliments, and <pb n="193"/>
            <note type="margin">B. VII.] </note> <lb/>
            stoppage in the bowels. Children with this complaint gene­ <lb/>
            rally die before the seventh day: wherefore also this day <lb/>
            has received a name, as if it gave some hope of the recovery <lb/>
            of the child. Children suffer most at the full moon. Chil­ <lb/>
            dren are in great danger when the spasms originate in the <lb/>
            back, especially if they are advancing in age.1 <note type="footnote"> 1 The seventh book ends very abruptly, and hence it has been thought <lb/>
            that what is now called the tenth book, in which the subject of repro­ <lb/>
            duction is continued, would have its proper place here, as a continua­ <lb/>
            tion of the seventh. Whether a portion of the genuine work of <lb/>
            Aristotle has been lost which would have completed the subject is <lb/>
            another question; but there can be little doubt that the tenth book, in <lb/>
            the form in which we have it, is no genuine. work of Aristotle ; some of <lb/>
            the opinions are contrary to those which he has expressed, and the <lb/>
            whole style and language is different from that of Aristotle. Schneider <lb/>
            therefore has placed the tenth book at the end of the work, that he may <lb/>
            neither entirely exclude that which in former times was considered a <lb/>
            portion of Aristotle's treatise on Animals, nor yet allow a fictitious <lb/>
            book to interrupt the genuine writings of his Author. </note> <pb n="194"/>

          <p>1. THE nature of animals and their mode of reproduction <lb/>
            has now been described. Their actions and mode of life <lb/>
            also differ according to their disposition and their food. <lb/>
            For almost all animals present traces of their moral dis­ <lb/>
            positions, though these distinctions are most remarkable <lb/>
            in man. For most of them, as we remarked, when speaking <lb/>
            of their various parts, appear to exhibit gentleness or <lb/>
            ferocity, mildness or cruelty, courage or cowardice, fear <lb/>
            or boldness, violence or cunning; and many of them ex­ <lb/>
            hibit something like a rational consciousness, as we re­ <lb/>
            marked in speaking of their parts. For they differ from <lb/>
            man, and man from the other animals, in a greater or less <lb/>
            degree; for some of these traits are exhibited strongly in <lb/>
            man, and others in other animals.</p>
          <p>2. Others differ in proportion. For as men exhibit art, <lb/>
            wisdom, and intelligence, animals possess, by way of com­ <lb/>
            pensation, some other physical power. This is most con­ <lb/>
            spicuous in the examination of infants, for in them we see, <lb/>
            as it were, the vestiges and seeds of their future disposition; <lb/>
            nor does their soul at this period differ in any respect from <lb/>
            that of an animal; so that it is not unreasonable for animals <lb/>
            to present the same, or similar, or analogous appearances. <lb/>
            Nature passes so gradually from inanimate to animate things, <lb/>
            that from their continuity their boundary and the mean be­ <lb/>
            tween them is indistinct. The race of plants succeeds imme­ <lb/>
            diately that of inanimate objects; and these differ from each <lb/>
            other in the proportion of life in which they participate; <lb/>
            for, compared with other bodies, plants appear to possess <lb/>
            life, though, when compared with animals, they appear in­ <lb/>
            animate.</p>
          <p>3. The change from plants to animals, however, is gra­ <lb/>
            dual, as I before observed, For a person might question to <pb n="195"/>
            <note type="margin">B VIII.] </note> <lb/>
            which of these classes some marine objects belong; for many <lb/>
            of them are attached to the rock, and perish as soon as they <lb/>
            are separated from it. The pinnæ are attached to the rocks, <lb/>
            the solens cannot live after they are taken away from their <lb/>
            localities ; and, on the whole, all the testacea resemble plants, <lb/>
            if we compare them with locomotive animals. Some of them <lb/>
            appear to have no sensation; in others it is very dull. The <lb/>
            body of some of them is naturally fleshy, as of those which are <lb/>
            called tethya ; and the acalephe and the sponge entirely re­ <lb/>
            semble plants; the progress is always gradual by which one <lb/>
            appears to have more life and motion than another.</p>
          <p>4. In the vital actions also we may observe the same man­ <lb/>
            ner. For vegetables which are produced from seed ap­ <lb/>
            pear to have no other work beyond reproduction; nor do <lb/>
            some animals appear to have any other object in their exist­ <lb/>
            ence. This object then is common to them all; but as sen­ <lb/>
            sation advances, their manner of life differs in their having <lb/>
            pleasure in sexual intercourse, in their mode of parturition <lb/>
            and rearing their young. Some of them, like plants, simply <lb/>
            accomplish their peculiar mode of reproduction at an ap­ <lb/>
            pointed season, and others are diligent in rearing their <lb/>
            young; but as soon as this is accomplished they separate <lb/>
            from them, and have no farther communication; but those <lb/>
            that are more intelligent, and possess more memory, use <lb/>
            their offspring in a more civilized manner.</p>
          <p>5. The work of reproduction is one part of their life, the <lb/>
            work of procuring food forms another. These two occupy <lb/>
            their labour and their life. Their food differs in the sub­ <lb/>
            stances of which it consists, and all the natural increase of the <lb/>
            body is derived from food. That which is natural is pleasant, <lb/>
            and all animals follow that which is pleasant to their nature.</p>

          <p>1. ANIMALS are divided according to the localities which <lb/>
            they inhabit; for some animals are terrestrial, others are <lb/>
            aquatic. They also admit of a ternary division, those that <lb/>
            breathe air and those that breathe water, one of these classes <lb/>
            is terrestrial, the other is aquatic ; the third class does not <lb/>
            breathe either air or water, but they are adapted by nature <lb/>
            to receive refreshment from each of these elements; and soma <lb/>
            of these are called terrestrial, others are aquatic, though they <note type="footnote"> O2 <lb/>
             </note> <pb n="196"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. VIII.</note> <lb/>
            neither breathe air or water; and there are other animals <lb/>
            which procure their food and make their abode in either of <lb/>
            these elements. For many that breathe air, and produce <lb/>
            their young upon the land, procure their food from the water, <lb/>
            where they generally make their abode; and these are the <lb/>
            only animals which appear to be doubtful, for they may be <lb/>
            arranged either as terrestrial or aquatic animals.</p>
          <p>2. Of those that breathe water, none have feet or wings, <lb/>
            nor seek their food on land ; but many of those that are ter­ <lb/>
            restrial, and breathe air, do so ; some of them so much so, that <lb/>
            they cannot live when separated from the water, as those <lb/>
            which are called marine turtles, and crocodiles, and hippo­ <lb/>
            potami, and seals, and some of the smaller creatures, as the <lb/>
            water tortoise and the frog tribe; for all these are suffocated <lb/>
            if their respiration is suspended for any length of time. They <lb/>
            produce their young and rear them on dry land; others do <lb/>
            so near the dry land, while they reside in the water.</p>
          <p>3. Of all animals the most remarkable in this particular <lb/>
            is the dolphin, and some other aquatic animals and cetacea <lb/>
            which are of this habit, as the whale and others which have <lb/>
            a blowhole ; for it is not easy to arrange them either with <lb/>
            aquatic or terrestrial animals, if we consider animals that <lb/>
            breathe air as terrestrial, and those that breathe water as <lb/>
            aquatics, for they partake of the characters of both classes; <lb/>
            for they receive the sea and eject it through their blowhole, <lb/>
            and air through their lungs, for they have this part, and <lb/>
            breathe through it. And the dolphin, when captured in nets, <lb/>
            is often suffocated, from the impossibility of breathing. It <lb/>
            will live for a long while out of water, snoring and groaning <lb/>
            like other breathing animals. It sleeps with its snout above <lb/>
            the water, in order that it may breathe through it.</p>
          <p>4. It is thus impossible to arrange it under both of these <lb/>
            contrary divisions, but it would appear that the aquatic ani­ <lb/>
            mals must be further subdivided; for they breathe and <lb/>
            eject water for the same reason as others breathe air, for <lb/>
            the sake of coolness. Other animals do this for the sake <lb/>
            of food; for those animals which obtain their food in the <lb/>
            water, must also, at the same time, swallow some of the <lb/>
            fluid, and have an organ by which they can eject it. Those <lb/>
            creatures which use water instead of air for breathing have <lb/>
            gills; those that use it for food have a blowhole. These <pb n="197"/>
            <note type="margin">B. VIII.] </note> <lb/>
            creatures are sanguineous. The nature of the malacia and <lb/>
            malacostraca is the same ;for these swallow water for <lb/>
            food.</p>
          <p>5. Those animals which breathe air, but live in the water, <lb/>
            and those which breathe water, and have gills, but go out <lb/>
            upon dry land and take their food there, belong to two divi­ <lb/>
            sions of aquatic animals. This last division is represented <lb/>
            by a single animal called the cordylus (water newt) ; for <lb/>
            this animal has no lungs, but gills; and it goes on dry land <lb/>
            to procure its food. It has four feet, so that it appears na­ <lb/>
            tural that it should walk. In all these animals nature ap­ <lb/>
            pears to be. as it were, turned aside, and some of the males <lb/>
            appear to be females, and the females have a male appear­ <lb/>
            ance ; for animals which have but small diversity in particular <lb/>
            parts, exhibit great variations in the whole body.</p>
          <p>6. This is evident in castrated animals ; for if a small <lb/>
            portion only of the body is destroyed, the animal becomes <lb/>
            a female ; so that it is plain that if a very minute portion <lb/>
            in the original composition of an animal becomes changed, <lb/>
            if that portion belongs to the origin of the species, it might <lb/>
            become either male or female; or, if taken away altogether, <lb/>
            the animal might be neuter. And so, either way, it might <lb/>
            become a land or aquatic animal, if only a small change took <lb/>
            placeit happens that some become terrestrial and <lb/>
            others aquatic animals, and some are not amphibious which <lb/>
            others are, because in their original generation they received <lb/>
            some kind of substance which they use for food. For that <lb/>
            which is natural is agreeable to every animal, as I have said <lb/>
            before.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER III.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. WHEN animals are divided in three ways into aquatic <lb/>
            and land animals, because they either breathe air or water, <lb/>
            or from the composition of their bodies; or, in the third <lb/>
            place, from their food, their manner of life will be found to <lb/>
            agree with these divisions. For some follow both the com­ <lb/>
            position of their bodies and the nature of their food, and <lb/>
            their respiration of either water or air. Others only agree <lb/>
            with their composition and food.</p>
          <p>2. The testacea which are immoveable live by a fluid <lb/>
            which percolates through tne dense parts of the sea, and <pb n="198"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. VIII. </note> <lb/>
            being digested because it is lighter than the sea water, thus <lb/>
            returns to its original nature. That this fluid exists in the <lb/>
            sea, and is capable of infiltration is manifest, and may be <lb/>
            proved by experiment; for if anyone will make a thin <lb/>
            waxen vessel, and sink it empty in the sea, in a night <lb/>
            and a day, it may be taken up full of water, which is <lb/>
            drinkable.</p>
          <p>3. The acalephe (actinia) feeds upon any small fish which <lb/>
            may fall in its way. Its mouth is placed in the centre of its <lb/>
            body. This organ is conspicuous in the larger individuals : <lb/>
            like the oyster, it has a passage for the exclusion of its food, <lb/>
            which is placed above. The acalephe appears to resemble the <lb/>
            internal part of the oyster, and it makes use of the rock, as <lb/>
            the oyster does of its shell. (The patella also is free, and <lb/>
            wanders about in search of food.)</p>
          <p>4. Among the locomotive testacea, some are carnivorous, <lb/>
            and live on small fish, as the purpura, for this creature is <lb/>
            carnivorous, it is therefore caught with a bait of flesh: <lb/>
            others live upon marine plants. The marine turtles <lb/>
            live upon shell-fish, for which purpose they have a very <lb/>
            powerful mouth; for if any of them take a stone or any­ <lb/>
            thing else, they break and eat it. This animal leaves the <lb/>
            water and eats grass. They often suffer and perish, when <lb/>
            they are dried up as they float on the surface, for they are <lb/>
            not able to dive readily.</p>
          <p>5. The malacostraca are of the same nature, for they eat <lb/>
            everything; they feed upon stones and mud, seaweeds and <lb/>
            dung, as the rock crabs, and are also carnivorous. The spiny <lb/>
            lobsters also overcome large fishes, and a kind of retribution <lb/>
            awaits them in turn, for the polypus prevails over the lobster, <lb/>
            for they are not inconvenienced by the shell of the lobster, <lb/>
            so that if the lobsters perceive them in the same net with <lb/>
            them, they die from fear. The spiny lobsters overcome the <lb/>
            congers, for their roughness prevents them from falling off. <lb/>
            The congers devour the polypi which cannot adhere to them <lb/>
            on account of the smoothness of their surface; all the ma­ <lb/>
            lacia are carnivorous.</p>
          <p>6. The spiny lobsters also live on small fish, which they hunt <lb/>
            for in their holes, for they are produced in such parts of the <lb/>
            sea as are rough and stony, and in those places make their <lb/>
            habitations; whatever they capture, they bring to their mouth <pb n="199"/>
            <note type="margin">B. VIII.] </note> <lb/>
            with their double claw, as the crabs do. When not fright­ <lb/>
            ened they naturally walk forwards, hanging their horns down <lb/>
            at their sides. When alarmed they retreat backwards, and <lb/>
            extend their horns to a great distance. They fight with <lb/>
            each other like rams with their horns, raising them and <lb/>
            striking each other. They are often seen in numbers as if <lb/>
            they were gregarious.</p>
          <p>7. The malacostraca lead this kind of life. Among the <lb/>
            malacia the teuthis and sepia prevail over the large fish. <lb/>
            The polypus generally collects shells which it empties of <lb/>
            their contents and feeds upon them, so that those who <lb/>
            seek for them find their holes by the shells that are scat­ <lb/>
            tered about. The report that they eat each other is a <lb/>
            mistake; but some have the tentacula eaten off by the <lb/>
            congers.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER IV.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. ALL fish at the season of oviposition live- upon ova; <lb/>
            in the rest of their food they are not all so well agreed, for <lb/>
            some of them are only carnivorous, as the selachos, conger, <lb/>
            channa, thynnus, labrax, sinodon, amia, orphus, and mu­ <lb/>
            raena ; the trigla lives upon fuel, shell-fish, and mud ;it is <lb/>
            also carnivorous. The cephalus lives on mud, the dascillus <lb/>
            on mud and dung. The scarus and melanurus on sea-weed, <lb/>
            the salpa on dung and fuci, it will also eat the plant called <lb/>
            horehound; it is the only fish that can be caught with the <lb/>
            gourd.</p>
          <p>2. All fish, except the cestreus, eat one another, especially <lb/>
            the congers. The cephalus and the cestreus alone are not <lb/>
            carnivorous. This is a proof of it. They are never cap­ <lb/>
            tured with anything of the kind in their stomach, nor are <lb/>
            they captured with a bait made of flesh, but with bread; <lb/>
            the cestreus is always fed upon sea-weed and sand. One <lb/>
            kind of cephalus which some persons call chelone lives near <lb/>
            the land, another is called peræas. This last feeds upon <lb/>
            nothing but its own mucus, for which reason it is always <lb/>
            very poor. The cephalus lives upon mud, wherefore they <lb/>
            are heavy and slimy. They certainly never eat fish, on <lb/>
            account of their dwelling in. mud; they often emerge <lb/>
            in order to wash themselves from the slime. Neither will <lb/>
            any creature eat their ova, so that they increase rapidly, <pb n="200"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. VIII.</note> <lb/>
            and when they increase they are devoured by other fish, and <lb/>
            especially by the achamus.</p>
          <p>3. The cestreus (mullet) is the most greedy and insatiable <lb/>
            of fish, so that its abdomen is distended, and it is not good for <lb/>
            food unless it is poor. When alarmed it hides its head, as if <lb/>
            its whole body were thus concealed; the sinodon also is car­ <lb/>
            nivorous, and eats the malacia. This fish and the channa <lb/>
            often eject their stomachs as they pursue small fish, for <lb/>
            their stomach is near the mouth, and they have no oesophagus. <lb/>
            Some are simply carnivorous, as the dolphin, sinodon, chry­ <lb/>
            sophrys, the selache and malacia; others, as the phycis, <lb/>
            cobius, and the rock-fish, principally feed upon mud and <lb/>
            fuel, and bryum, and what is called caulion, and any matter <lb/>
            which may be produced in the sea. The phycis eats no <lb/>
            other flesh than that of the shrimps. They also frequently eat <lb/>
            each other, as I before remarked, and the greater devour the <lb/>
            less. It is a proof that they are carnivorous, that they are <lb/>
            captured with bait made of flesh.</p>
          <p>4. The amia, tunny, and labrax generally eat flesh, <lb/>
            though they also eat sea-weed. The sargus feeds after the <lb/>
            trigla when the last has buried itself in the mud and <lb/>
            departed, for it has the power of burying itself, then the <lb/>
            sargus comes and feeds and prevents all those that are <lb/>
            weaker than itself from approaching. The fish called <lb/>
            scarus is the only one which appears to ruminate like quad­ <lb/>
            rupeds. Other fish appear to hunt the smaller ones with <lb/>
            their mouths towards them, in this way they naturally swim; <lb/>
            but the selachea, dolphins and cetacea throw themselves on <lb/>
            their back to capture their prey, for their mouth is placed <lb/>
            below them, for this reason the smaller ones escape, or if <lb/>
            not they would soon be reduced in number; for the swiftness <lb/>
            of the dolphin and its capacity for food appear incredible.</p>
          <p>5. A few eels in some places are fed upon mud, and any <lb/>
            kind of food which may be cast into the water, but gene­ <lb/>
            rally they live upon fresh water, and those who rear eels <lb/>
            take care that the water which flows off and on upon the <lb/>
            shallows in which they live may be clear, where they make <lb/>
            the eel preserves. For they are soon suffocated if the water <lb/>
            is not clean, their gills being very small. For this reason <lb/>
            those who seek for them disturb the water. In the Stry­ <lb/>
            mon they are taken about the time of the rising of the <pb n="201"/>
            <note type="margin">B. VIII.] </note> <lb/>
            Pleiades. For the water is disturbed at this season by the <lb/>
            mud which is stirred up by contrary winds, otherwise it is <lb/>
            useless to attempt to obtain them. When dead, eels do <lb/>
            not rise and float on the surface, like other fishes, for their <lb/>
            stomach is small; a few of them are fat, but this is not <lb/>
            usually the case.</p>
          <p>6. When taken out of the water, they will live five or six <lb/>
            days; if the wind is in the north they will live longer than <lb/>
            if it is in the south. If they are removed from the ponds <lb/>
            to the eel preserves during the summer they perish, but <lb/>
            not if removed in the winter; neither will they bear violent <lb/>
            changes, for if they are taken and plunged into cold water, <lb/>
            they often perish in great numbers. They are suffocated <lb/>
            also if kept in a small quantity of water. This takes place <lb/>
            also in other fish, which are suffocated if kept in a small <lb/>
            quantity of water which is never changed, like animals <lb/>
            which breathe air when enclosed in a small quantity of <lb/>
            air. Some eels live seven or eight years. Fresh-water fish <lb/>
            make use of food, and devour each other, as well as plants <lb/>
            and roots, or anything else that they can find in the mud ; <lb/>
            they generally feed in the night, and during the day dwell <lb/>
            in deep holes. This is the nature of the food of fish.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>1. ALL birds with crooked claws are carnivorous, nor are <lb/>
            they able to eat corn even when put in their mouths. All <lb/>
            the eagles belong to this class and the kites, and both the <lb/>
            hawks, the pigeon hawk namely, and the sparrow hawk. <lb/>
            These differ in size from each other, and so does the trior­ <lb/>
            ches. This bird is as large as the kite, and is visible at all <lb/>
            seasons of the year; the osprey and vulture also belong <lb/>
            to this class. The osprey is as large as the eagle, and ash- <lb/>
            coloured. There are two kinds of vultures, one small and <lb/>
            whitish, the other large and cinereous.</p>
          <p>2. Some of the night birds also have crooked claws, as <lb/>
            the nycticorax, owl, and bryas. The bryas resembles an <lb/>
            owl in appearance, but it is as large as an eagle; the eleos, <lb/>
            ægolius, and scops also belong to this class. The eleos is <lb/>
            larger than a domestic fowl, the ægolius is about the size of <lb/>
            that bird, they both hunt the jay. The scope is less than <pb n="202"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. VIII </note> <lb/>
            the owl; all three of these are similar in form, and carni­ <lb/>
            vorous. Some that have not crooked claws are carnivorous, <lb/>
            as the swallow.</p>
          <p>3. Some birds feed on worms, as the finch, the sparrow, <lb/>
            batis, chloris, titmouse. There are three kinds of titmouse ; <lb/>
            the spizites is the largest, it is as large as the finch. <lb/>
            Another is called the orinus, because it dwells in mountains ; <lb/>
            it has a large tail. The third resembles them in everything <lb/>
            except its size, for it is very small. The sycalis also, the <lb/>
            megalocoryphus, pyrrhulas, erithacus, hypola'is, oestrus, ty­ <lb/>
            rannis are of this class. The last of these is the least, it <lb/>
            is not much larger than a locust; it has a purple crest, and is <lb/>
            altogether a graceful and well-formed bird. The bird called <lb/>
            anthus also, which is of the size of the finch ; the orospizus is <lb/>
            like the finch, and nearly of the same size, it has a blue stripe <lb/>
            on its neck, and lives in mountainous places. The wren <lb/>
            also lives upon seeds. All these and such like birds either <lb/>
            partly or entirely live on worms.</p>
          <p>4. These birds, the acanthis, thraupis, and that which is <lb/>
            called chrysometris, all live upon thorns, but neither eat <lb/>
            worms or any other living creature, and they both roost and <lb/>
            feed in the same places. There are others which feed on <lb/>
            gnats; these live chiefly by hunting for these insects, as the <lb/>
            greater and lesser pipe, both of which are by some per­ <lb/>
            sons called woodpeckers. They resemble each other in <lb/>
            their cry, though that of the larger bird is the louder, <lb/>
            and they both feed by flying against trees. The celeos <lb/>
            also, which is as large as a turtle dove, and entirely <lb/>
            yellow; its habit is to strike against trees; it generally lives <lb/>
            upon trees, and has a loud voice. This bird generally in­ <lb/>
            habits the Peloponnesus. There is also another called <lb/>
            cnipologus, which is small, about the size of the acanthyllis; <lb/>
            its colour is cinereous and spotted, and its voice is weak; <lb/>
            this bird also pecks trees.</p>
          <p>5. There are other birds which live upon fruit and grasses, <lb/>
            as the phaps, phatta, peristera, cenas, and trygon.1 The <lb/>
            phatta and peristera are always present, the trygon only in <lb/>
            summer time; in the winter it is not seen, for it hides itself <lb/>
            in holes. The œnas is generally seen and captured in the <lb/>
            autumn. The œnas is as large as the peristera but less than <note type="footnote"><unclear>1</unclear> Different species of pigeons and doves. </note> <pb n="203"/>
            <note type="margin">B. VIII.]</note> <lb/>
            the phaps. It is generally captured as it is drinking; it <lb/>
            comes to this country when it has young. All the rest <lb/>
            come in the summer, and make their nests here, and all, <lb/>
            except the pigeon tribe, live upon animal food.</p>
          <p>6. All birds, as far as food is concerned, are either ter­ <lb/>
            restrial or live in the neighbourhood of rivers and ponds, <lb/>
            or near the sea. Those that have webbed feet pass the <lb/>
            greater part of their time on the water; those with divided <lb/>
            feet near the water. Some of these dive for their food, <lb/>
            such as live upon plants and do not eat flesh ; others, as the <lb/>
            heron and white heron, live in ponds and rivers. The latter <lb/>
            of these is smaller than the former, and has a flat large bill.</p>
          <p>7. The pelargus also, and the gull, the latter is ash-co­ <lb/>
            loured, and the schœnilus, cinclos, pygargus, (and tryngas) <lb/>
            this last is the largest of these small birds, for it is of the <lb/>
            same size as the thrush ; all these birds wag their tails. The <lb/>
            calidris also, this bird is variegated and ash-coloured. The <lb/>
            kingfisher also lives near the water; there appear to be two <lb/>
            kinds of this bird, one of which utters its cry as it sits <lb/>
            upon the reeds, and the other, which is larger, is silent; <lb/>
            they both have a blue back. The trochilus also, and the <lb/>
            kingfisher and cerylus also live near the sea. The corona <lb/>
            also lives upon animals which are cast on shore, for it is <lb/>
            omnivorous. The white gull also, the cepphus, æthyia, and <lb/>
            charadrius.</p>
          <p>8. The heavier web-footed birds inhabit the neighbour­ <lb/>
            hood of rivers and ponds, as the swan, duck, phalaris, colum­ <lb/>
            bis, and the boscas, which is like a duck, but smaller; and <lb/>
            the bird called corax, which is as large as the pelargus, but <lb/>
            its legs are shorter, it is web-footed and a swimmer, its <lb/>
            colour is black; this last bird perches upon trees, and is <lb/>
            the only one of this class that builds its nest in such places. <lb/>
            The great and small -goose also, the latter is gregarious, and <lb/>
            chenalopex, the aix, and the penelops. The sea eagle also lives <lb/>
            near the sea, and fishes in the waters of lakes. Many birds <lb/>
            are omnivorous; those with crooked claws seize upon other <lb/>
            animals which they can overcome, and upon birds. They do <lb/>
            not, however, devour their own congeners, as fish frequently <lb/>
            do; all the tribes of birds drink very little, those with <lb/>
            crooked claws do not drink at all, or only a few of them, <lb/>
            and these but seldom; of these the cenchris drinks the <pb n="204"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. VIlI.</note> <lb/>
            most ;the kite rarely drinks, though it has been observed <lb/>
            to do so.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER VI.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. ANIMALS covered with scaly plates, as the lizard and <lb/>
            other quadrupeds and serpents, are omnivorous, for they eat <lb/>
            both flesh and grass, and serpents lick their prey more than <lb/>
            any other animal; all these creatures, and indeed all with <lb/>
            spongy lungs, drink very little, and all that are oviparous are <lb/>
            of this kind, and have but little blood. Serpents are all <lb/>
            very fond of wine, so that they hunt the viper by placing <lb/>
            vessels of wine in the hedge-rows, and they are captured <lb/>
            when intoxicated. Serpents devour any animal that they <lb/>
            may have captured, and when they have sucked out the <lb/>
            juice, they reject all the remainder; nearly all such animals <lb/>
            do this, as also the spiders. But the spiders suck the juice <lb/>
            without swallowing the animal. Serpents suck the juice <lb/>
            internally.</p>
          <p>2. The serpent swallows any food which may be presented <lb/>
            to it, for it will devour both birds and beasts, and suck eggs. <lb/>
            When it has taken its food it draws itself up, till it stands <lb/>
            erect upon its extremity, it then gathers itself up and con­ <lb/>
            tracts itself a little, so that when stretched out the animal <lb/>
            it has swallowed may descend in its stomach; it does this <lb/>
            because its oesophagus is long and thin. Phalangia and <lb/>
            serpents can live a long while without food, this may be <lb/>
            seen in those that are kept by dealers in medicine.</p>

          <p>1. AMONG viviparous quadrupeds, those that are wild and <lb/>
            have pointed teeth are all carnivorous, except some wolves, <lb/>
            which, when they are hungry, will, as they say, eat a certain <lb/>
            kind of earth, but this is the only exception. They will not <lb/>
            eat grass unless they are sick, for some dogs eat grass and <lb/>
            vomit it up again, and so are purified. The solitary wolves <lb/>
            are more eager for human flesh than those which hunt in <lb/>
            packs.</p>
          <p>2. The animal which some persons call the glanus and <lb/>
            others the hyaena, is not less than the wolf, it has a mane <lb/>
            like a horse, but the hair all along its spine is more harsh <lb/>
            and thick. It also secretly attacks men, and hunts them <pb n="205"/>
            <note type="margin">B. VIII.] </note> <lb/>
            down; it hunts dogs also by vomiting like men; it also <lb/>
            breaks open graves for the sake of this kind of food.</p>
          <p>3. The bear is also omnivorous, for it eats fruit, and on <lb/>
            account of the softness of its body it can climb trees; it <lb/>
            eats leguminous seeds also; it also overturns hives and eats <lb/>
            the honey, and it feeds upon crabs and ants, and is car­ <lb/>
            nivorous, for its strength enables it to attack not only deer, <lb/>
            but wild hogs, if it can fall upon them secretly, and oxen. <lb/>
            For when it meets the bull face to face, it falls upon its back, <lb/>
            and when the bull attempts to throw it, seizes its horns <lb/>
            with its fore-legs, and biting upon the shoulder of the bull, <lb/>
            throws it down. For a short time it can walk upright on <lb/>
            its hind legs. It eats flesh after it has become putrid.</p>
          <p>4. The lion, like all other wild animals with pointed teeth, <lb/>
            is carnivorous; it devours its food greedily, and swallows <lb/>
            large pieces without dividing them ; it can afterwards, from <lb/>
            its repletion, remain two or three days without food. It <lb/>
            drinks very little. Its excrement is small, and is not made <lb/>
            more than once in three days or thereabouts, and it is dry <lb/>
            and hard like that of a dog. The wind from its bowels has <lb/>
            an acrid smell, and its urine is powerfully scented, for which <lb/>
            reason dogs smell to trees, for the lion, like the dog, lifts its <lb/>
            leg to make water. It produces also a strong smell when <lb/>
            it breathes upon its food, and when its bowels are laid open <lb/>
            they emit a strong scent.</p>
          <p>5. Some quadrupeds and wild animals seek their food in <lb/>
            the neighbourhood of ponds and rivers, but none of them <lb/>
            except the seal live near the sea; of this class are the crea­ <lb/>
            ture called beaver, and the satherium, the satyrium, the <lb/>
            otter, and that which is called latax. This creature is <lb/>
            broader than the enydris, and has strong teeth, for it often <lb/>
            goes out in the night and with its teeth gnaws off the osiers. <lb/>
            The enydris also will bite men, and they say will not leave <lb/>
            its hold till it hears the noise of its teeth against the bone. <lb/>
            The latax has rough hair, the nature of which is between <lb/>
            that of the seal and that of the deer.</p>

          <p>1. ANIMALS with pointed teeth drink by lapping, and some <lb/>
            that have not pointed teeth, as mice. Those which have an <lb/>
            even surface to their teeth draw in the water as horses and <pb n="206"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. VIII.</note> <lb/>
            oxen ; the bear neither draws in the water nor laps it, but <lb/>
            gulps it down. Some birds draw in the water, but those <lb/>
            which have long necks imbibe it at intervals, lifting up their <lb/>
            heads; the porphyrion alone gulps it down. All horned <lb/>
            animals, both domestic and wild, and those that have not <lb/>
            pointed teeth eat fruits and grass, and are incapable of en­ <lb/>
            during hunger, except the dog, and this animal eats fruit <lb/>
            and grass less than any other.</p>
          <p>2. The hog eats roots more than other animals, because <lb/>
            its snout is well adapted for this operation, it is more <lb/>
            adapted to various kinds of food than other animals. In <lb/>
            proportion to its size its fat is developed very fast, for it be­ <lb/>
            comes fat in sixty days. Those who occupy themselves in <lb/>
            fatting hogs know how fast they fatten by weighing them <lb/>
            when lean; they will become fat after starvation for three <lb/>
            days. Almost all other animals become fat, after previous <lb/>
            starvation. After three days those who fatten hogs feed <lb/>
            them well.</p>
          <p>3. The Thracians fatten them by giving them drink on <lb/>
            the first day, then at first they omit one day, afterwards two, <lb/>
            three, or four, till they reach to seven days. These creatures <lb/>
            are fattened with barley, millet, figs, acorns, wild pears, and <lb/>
            cucumbers. Both this and other animals with a warm <lb/>
            stomach are fattened in idleness, and the sow also by wal­ <lb/>
            lowing in the mire. They prefer different kinds of food at <lb/>
            different ages. The hog and the wolf fight together, a sixth <lb/>
            part of its weight when alive, consists of bristles, blood, and <lb/>
            fat. Sows and all other animals grow lean while suckling <lb/>
            their young. This then, is the nature of these animals.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER IX.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. OXEN eat both fruits and grass. They become fat on <lb/>
            flatulent food, as vetches, broken beans, and stems of beans, <lb/>
            and if any person having cut a hole in the skin inflates them <lb/>
            and then feeds the older cattle, they fatten more rapidly, <lb/>
            and either on whole or broken barley, or on sweet food, as on <lb/>
            figs and grapes, wine, and the leaves of the elm, and especially <lb/>
            in the sunshine and in warm waters. The horns of the calf, <lb/>
            if anointed with wax, may be directed in any way that is de­ <lb/>
            sired, and they suffer less in the feet if their horns are <lb/>
            rubbed with wax, or pitch, or oil. <pb n="207"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin">B. VIII.] </note> 2. Herds of cattle suffer less when moved in frost than <lb/>
            in snow, They grow if they are deprived for a long time <lb/>
            of sexual intercourse ; wherefore the herdsmen in Epirus <lb/>
            keep the Pyrrhic cattle, as they are called, for nine years <lb/>
            without sexual intercourse, in order that they may grow. <lb/>
            They call such cows apotauri. The number of these crea­ <lb/>
            tures reaches four hundred, and they are the property of <lb/>
            the king. They will not live in any other country, though <lb/>
            the attempt has been made.</p>

          <p>1. THE horse, mule, and ass feed upon fruit and grass, but <lb/>
            they fatten especially on drinking, so that beasts of burden <lb/>
            enjoy their food in proportion to the quantity of water <lb/>
            which they drink, and the less difficulty there is of obtain­ <lb/>
            ing drink, the more they profit by abundance of grass. <lb/>
            When the mare is in foal, green food causes her hair to be <lb/>
            fine, but when it contains hard knots it is not wholesome. <lb/>
            The first crop of Medic grass is not good, nor if any stinking <lb/>
            water has come near it, for it gives it a bad smell. Oxen <lb/>
            require pure water to drink, but horses in this respect re­ <lb/>
            semble camels. The camel prefers water that is dirty and <lb/>
            thick ; nor will it drink from a stream before it has dis­ <lb/>
            turbed the water. It can remain without drinking four <lb/>
            days, after which it drinks a great quantity.</p>

          <p>1. THE elephant can eat more than nine Macedonian me­ <lb/>
            dimni at one meal, but so much food at once is dangerous; <lb/>
            it should not have altogether more than six or seven me­ <lb/>
            dimni, or five medimni of bread, and five mares of wine, <lb/>
            the maris measures six cotylæ. An elephant has been known <lb/>
            to drink as much as fourteen Macedonian measures at once, <lb/>
            and eight more again in the evening. Many camels live <lb/>
            thirty years, and some much more, for they have been known <lb/>
            to live an hundred years. Some say that the elephant <lb/>
            lives two hundred, and others three hundred years.</p>

          <p>1. SHEEP and goats live upon grass. Sheep pasture for a <lb/>
            long while in one place without leaving it, but goats change <pb n="208"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. VIII. </note> <lb/>
            their places very soon, and only crop the top of the grass. <lb/>
            The sheep fatten rapidly with drinking, and for this reason <lb/>
            during summer they give them salt, a medimnus to each hun­ <lb/>
            dred sheep; for in this manner the flock becomes more <lb/>
            healthy and fat, and frequently they collect and bring them <lb/>
            together for this purpose, that they may mix a great deal of <lb/>
            salt with their food; for when thirsty they drink the more. <lb/>
            And in the autumn they feed them with gourds which <lb/>
            they have sprinkled with salt, for this makes them give more <lb/>
            milk. When driven about in the heat of the day they drink <lb/>
            more towards evening. If fed with salt after parturition, <lb/>
            the udder becomes larger.</p>
          <p>2. Sheep fatten on green shoots, vetches, and all kinds of <lb/>
            grass, and they fatten more rapidly when their food is <lb/>
            salted. They fatten more rapidly if previously starved for <lb/>
            three days. During autumn northern water is better for <lb/>
            sheep than southern, and pastures towards the west are <lb/>
            good for them. Long journeys and weariness make them <lb/>
            lean. Shepherds distinguish the strong sheep during winter <lb/>
            by the frost adhering to their wool, which is not the case <lb/>
            with those that are sick; for those that are not strong <lb/>
            move about in their weakness and shake it off.</p>
          <p>3. The flesh of all quadrupeds which feed in marshy <lb/>
            grounds is inferior to that of those which live on high <lb/>
            ground. Sheep with wide tails endure the winter better <lb/>
            than those with long tails, and short woolled-sheep better <lb/>
            than long-woolled, and those with curly wool are more <lb/>
            affected by the cold. Sheep are more healthy than goats, <lb/>
            though goats are the stronger. The fleece and the wool of <lb/>
            sheep which have been devoured by wolves, and garments <lb/>
            made of such wool are more subject to vermin than others.</p>

          <p>1. THOSE insects which have teeth are omnivorous, but those <lb/>
            which have a tongue only live upon fluids, which they collect <lb/>
            from all sources with this organ. Some of these are omni­ <lb/>
            vorous, for they feed upon all kinds of fluids, as the fly. <lb/>
            Others only suck blood, as the myops and oestrus. Others, <lb/>
            again, lIve upon the juices of plants and fruit. The bee is <lb/>
            the only insect that never touches anything putrid. It uses <pb n="209"/>
            <note type="margin">B. VIII.] </note> <lb/>
            no food that has not a sweet taste. They also take very <lb/>
            sweet water, wherever they fall upon any that is pure. The <lb/>
            different kinds of animals then use these kinds of food.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XIV.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. ALL the actions of animals are employed either in sexual <lb/>
            intercourse, or in rearing their young, or in procuring food <lb/>
            for themselves, or in providing against excessive heat and <lb/>
            cold, and the changes of the seasons. For they all have <lb/>
            naturally a sensitiveness respecting heat and cold, and, like <lb/>
            mankind, who either change their abodes in cold weather, <lb/>
            or those who have large estates, pass their summer in cold <lb/>
            countries and their winter in warm ones; so animals, also, if <lb/>
            they can, migrate from place to place. Some of them find <lb/>
            protection in their accustomed localities, others are migra­ <lb/>
            tory ; and at the autumnal equinox, escape at the approach <lb/>
            of winter, from the Pontus and other cold places; and in <lb/>
            spring retreat again before the approach of summer from hot <lb/>
            to cold countries, for they are afraid of excessive heat. Some <lb/>
            migrate from places close at hand, and others from the <lb/>
            very ends of the earth.</p>
          <p>2. The cranes do this, for they travel from Scythia to the <lb/>
            marshes in the higher parts of Egypt, from which the Nile <lb/>
            originates. This is the place where the Pygmies dwell; and <lb/>
            this is no fable, for there is really, as it is said, a race of <lb/>
            dwarfs, both men and horses, which lead the life of troglo­ <lb/>
            dites. The pelicans also are migratory, and leave the river <lb/>
            Strymon for the later, where they rear their young. They <lb/>
            depart in great crowds, and those that are before wait for <lb/>
            those behind, for in flying over the mountains those behind <lb/>
            cannot see the leaders.</p>
          <p>3. The fish also, in the same manner, migrate either from <lb/>
            or to the Pontus, and in winter they leave the deep water <lb/>
            for the sake of the warmth of the shore, and in summer <lb/>
            they escape from the heat by migrating from the shore into <lb/>
            deep water. Delicate birds, also, in winter and frosty wea­ <lb/>
            ther, descend from the mountains to the plains, for the sake <lb/>
            of the warmth ;and in summer they return again to the <lb/>
            mountains for fear of the heat.</p>
          <p>4. Those that are the most delicate are the first to make <lb/>
            the change at each extreme of heat and cold, such as the <note type="footnote"> P </note> <pb n="210"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. VIII. </note> <lb/>
            mackerel migrate sooner than the tunnies, and the quails than <lb/>
            cranes; for some migrate in August, others in September. <lb/>
            They are always fatter when they migrate from cold coun­ <lb/>
            tries, than when they leave warm countries, as the quail is <lb/>
            more fat in the autumn than the spring : and so it happens <lb/>
            that they migrate alike from cold countries and from warm <lb/>
            seasons. Their sexual desires are also more violent in the <lb/>
            spring, and when they leave warm countries.</p>
          <p>5. Among birds, as it was previously remarked, the crane <lb/>
            migrates from one extremity of the earth to the other, and they <lb/>
            By against the wind. As for the story about the stone, it is a <lb/>
            fiction, for they say that they carry a stone as ballast, which <lb/>
            is useful as a touchstone for gold, after they have vomited it <lb/>
            up. The phatta and the peleias leave us, and do not win­ <lb/>
            ter with us, nor does the turtle; but the pigeon stays <lb/>
            through the winter. The same is the nature of the quail, <lb/>
            unless a few individuals both of the turtle and quail remain <lb/>
            behind in sunny spots. The phatta and turtle assemble in <lb/>
            large flocks when they depart, and again at the season of <lb/>
            their return. The quails, when they commence their <lb/>
            flight, if the weather is fine and the wind in the north, go in <lb/>
            pairs, and have a successful voyage. If the wind is south <lb/>
            it goes hard with them, for their flight is slow, and this <lb/>
            wind is moist and heavy. Those that hunt them, therefore, <lb/>
            pursue them when the wind is in the south, but not in fine <lb/>
            weather. They By badly on account of their weight, for <lb/>
            their body is large. They therefore make a noise as they <lb/>
            By, for it is a toil to them.</p>
          <p>6. When they come hither they have no leader, but when <lb/>
            they depart hence, the glottis, ortygometra, otus, and cy­ <lb/>
            chramus, which calls them together at night, accompany <lb/>
            them ; and when the fowlers hear this sound, they know <lb/>
            that they will not remain. The ortygometra in form resem­ <lb/>
            bles the birds which inhabit marshes. The glottis has a <lb/>
            tongue which it projects to a great length. The otus resem. <lb/>
            bles an owl, and has small feathers at its ears. Some per­ <lb/>
            sons call it the nycticorax, it is mischievous and imitative, <lb/>
            it is taken like the owl, as it dances from side to side, one <lb/>
            or other of the fowlers compassing it about. On the whole, <lb/>
            birds with crooked claws have short necks, broad tongues, <lb/>
            and a capacity for imitation. And so has the Indian bird, <pb n="211"/>

          <p>1. IT has already been observed that fish migrate from the <lb/>
            deep water to the coast, and from the coast to the deep <lb/>
            water, in order to avoid the excesses of cold and heat. Those <lb/>
            that frequent the neighbourhood of the coast are better than <lb/>
            those from deep water, for the feeding grounds are better <lb/>
            and more abundant. For wherever the sun strikes the plants <lb/>
            are more frequent, and superior, and more delicate, as in gar­ <lb/>
            dens, and the black shore-weed grows near the land, and the <lb/>
            other kinds rather resemble uncultivated plants. The neigh­ <lb/>
            bourhood of the coast is also more temperate, both in heat and <lb/>
            cold, than the rest of the sea; for which reason the flesh of <lb/>
            fish which live near the shore is more compact, while that of <lb/>
            fish from deep sea is watery and soft. The sinodon, cantha­ <lb/>
            rus, orphos, chrysophrys, cestreus, trigla, cichla, dracon, calli­ <lb/>
            onymus, cobius, and all the rock fish live near the shore. The <lb/>
            trygon, selache, the white congers, the channa, erythrinus, <lb/>
            and glaucus inhabit deep water. The phagrus, scorpius, the <lb/>
            black conger, the muræna, and coccyx occupy either situa­ <lb/>
            tion indifferently.</p>
          <p>2. They vary also in different places; as in the neighbour­ <lb/>
            hood of Crete the cobius and all the rock fish are fat. The <lb/>
            tunny also becomes good again after Arcturus, for it is not <lb/>
            tormented by the oestrus after that period; for which reason <lb/>
            also it is inferior during the summer. In lakes near the sea <lb/>
            also there are several kinds of fish, as the salpa, chrysophrys, <lb/>
            trigla, and nearly all the rest. The amia also is found in <lb/>
            such situations as in the vicinity of Alopeconnesus, and in <lb/>
            the lake of Bistonis there are many fish. Many of the coliæ <lb/>
            do not enter the Pontus; but they pass the summer and <lb/>
            rear their young in the Propontis, and winter in the Ægean. <lb/>
            The thynnus, pelamis, and amia enter the Pontus in the <lb/>
            spring and pass the summer there, and so do nearly all the <lb/>
            rhyades and the gregarious fish. Many fish are gregarious, <lb/>
            and gregarious fish have a leader of the shoal.</p>
          <p>3. They all enter the Pontus for the sake of the food <lb/>
            for the pasture is more abundant and superior, on account <note type="footnote"> P 2 </note> <pb n="212"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. VIII. </note> <lb/>
            of the fresh water), and for fear of the large creatures, <lb/>
            which are smaller there; and except the phocona and dol­ <lb/>
            phin, there is no other found in the Pontus ; and the dolphin <lb/>
            is small, but when we leave the Pontus we find a larger <lb/>
            dolphin. They enter this sea for the sake of food and rear­ <lb/>
            ing their young; for the situation is better for this purpose, <lb/>
            and the fresh sweet water nourishes the young fry. When <lb/>
            they have reared their young, and the fry begin to grow, <lb/>
            they migrate immediately after the Pleiades. If the south <lb/>
            wind blow during the winter, they leave the place more <lb/>
            slowly; but with a north wind they swim faster, for then <lb/>
            the wind helps them along. The small fry is captured in <lb/>
            the neighbourhood of Byzantium, for they make no long <lb/>
            stay in the Pontus.</p>
          <p>4. The other fish are seen both in their egress and ingress. <lb/>
            The trichia is only seen as it enters, and is not observed to <lb/>
            leave again; and if one is captured at Byzantium, the fisher­ <lb/>
            men purify their nets, for it is unusual for them to return. <lb/>
            The reason is this: these are the only fish that swim up into <lb/>
            the Ister, and when this river divides they swim down into <lb/>
            the Adriatic. The following is a proof; for the converse <lb/>
            happens here, and they are never captured entering the <lb/>
            Adriatic, but as they leave it.</p>
          <p>5. The tunnies, as they enter, swim with their right side <lb/>
            to the shore, and leave with their left side to the shore; and <lb/>
            some persons say that they do this because they see better <lb/>
            with their right eye, and their sight is naturally dim. The <lb/>
            rhyades move during the day, and in the night remain quiet <lb/>
            and feed, unless the moon is bright, in which case they con­ <lb/>
            tinue their journey and do not rest themselves. And some <lb/>
            persons engaged about the sea say that after the winter <lb/>
            solstice they do not move, but remain quiet wherever they <lb/>
            may be till the equinox.</p>
          <p>6. The coliæ are taken as they enter, but not as they <lb/>
            return. The best are taken in the Propontis before the <lb/>
            breeding season. The other rhyades are captured more <lb/>
            frequently as they leave the Pontus, and are then in perfec­ <lb/>
            tion. Those that swim near the shore are the fattest when <lb/>
            captured; and the farther they are away, the more lean they <lb/>
            are; and frequently, when the south wina blows, they swim <lb/>
            out in company with the coliæ and mackerel, and are taken <pb n="213"/>
            <note type="margin">B. VIII.] </note> <lb/>
            lower down rather than at Byzantium. This is the nature <lb/>
            of their migrations.</p>

          <p>1. LAND animals have also the same disposition for con­ <lb/>
            cealment. For in winter they all hasten to conceal them­ <lb/>
            selves, and appear again when the season becomes warmer. <lb/>
            Animals conceal themselves to guard against the excesses <lb/>
            of temperature. In some the whole race is concealed ; in <lb/>
            others only a part of them. All the testacea conceal them­ <lb/>
            selves, as those which are marine, the purpura, whelk, and <lb/>
            all that class; but the state of concealment is more con­ <lb/>
            spicuous in those which do not adhere to rocks ; for these <lb/>
            also conceal themselves, as the pectens. Some have an <lb/>
            operculum on their exterior, as the land snails; and the <lb/>
            alteration of those that are not free is inconspicuous. They <lb/>
            do not all conceal themselves at the same period; for the <lb/>
            snails are torpid during the winter, the purpura and whelk <lb/>
            for thirty days under the dog star, and the pectens at the <lb/>
            same period. Most of them conceal themselves in very <lb/>
            cold and very hot weather.</p>
          <p>2. Almost all insects become torpid, except those which <lb/>
            dwell in the habitations of men, and those that perish and <lb/>
            do not survive for a year. They are torpid in the winter., <lb/>
            Some conceal themselves for a good while, others only in <lb/>
            the coldest days, as the bees, for these also conceal them­ <lb/>
            selves. This is shown by their not touching the food which <lb/>
            is prepared for them; and if any of them creep out, they <lb/>
            appear transparent, and plainly have nothing in their sto­ <lb/>
            mach. They remain at rest from the setting of the Pleiades <lb/>
            until the spring. Animals pass their torpid state in warm <lb/>
            places, and in the spots they are accustomed to inhabit.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XVII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. MANY sanguineous animals become torpid, as those which <lb/>
            are furnished with scales, the serpent, lizard, gecko, and <lb/>
            the river crocodile, during the four winter months in which <lb/>
            they eat nothing. Other serpents conceal themselves in the <lb/>
            earth, but the viper lies hidden among stones. Many fish <lb/>
            also become torpid, especially the hippurus and coracinus <lb/>
            during the winter; for these alone are never taken but at <pb n="214"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. VIII.</note> <lb/>
            certain seasons, which never vary. Almost all the rest are <lb/>
            taken at all seasons. The lamprey, orphus, and conger con­ <lb/>
            ceal themselves. The rock fish conceal themselves in pairs, <lb/>
            as the cichla, cottyphus, and perca, the male with the female, <lb/>
            in which way also they prepare for their young.</p>
          <p>2. The tunny conceals itself during winter in deep <lb/>
            places, and they become fattest at this season. The season <lb/>
            of capturing them commences with the rising of Pleiades, <lb/>
            and continues to the end of the setting of Arcturus. All <lb/>
            the rest of their time they remain quiet in concealment. A <lb/>
            few of these are taken during the period of their concealment, <lb/>
            and so are some other hybernating creatures, if they are <lb/>
            disturbed by the warmth of their abode or the unusual <lb/>
            mildness of the season. For they come out a little from <lb/>
            their holes to feed, and also when the moon is full. Most <lb/>
            fish are better tasted during the period of concealment. The <lb/>
            primades bury themselves in the mud. This is shown by <lb/>
            their not being taken, or their seeming to have a great deal <lb/>
            of mud on their backs and their fins pressed down.</p>
          <p>3. In spring, however, they begin to move and come to <lb/>
            the shore to copulate and deposit their ova. At this season <lb/>
            they are captured full of ova, and then also they appear to <lb/>
            be in season, but are not so good in autumn and winter. <lb/>
            At the same season also the males appear to be full of <lb/>
            melt. When their ova are small they are taken with diffi­ <lb/>
            culty; but as they grow larger many are taken when they <lb/>
            are infested by the oestrus. Some fish bury themselves in <lb/>
            sand, others in mud, with only their mouths above the surface. <lb/>
            Fishes usually conceal themselves only in the winter. The <lb/>
            malacostraca, the rock fishes, the batus, and selache only in <lb/>
            the most severe weather. This is shown by the difficulty of <lb/>
            capturing them in cold weather.</p>
          <p>4. Some fish, as the glaucus, conceal themselves in sum­ <lb/>
            mer time; for this fish hides itself for sixty days in the <lb/>
            summer time. The onus and the chrysophrys hide them­ <lb/>
            selves. The reason for supposing that the onus hides itself <lb/>
            for a long while appears to be that it is captured at long <lb/>
            intervals; and the influence of the stars upon them; and <lb/>
            especially of the dog-star, appears to be the cause of their <lb/>
            hiding themselves in summer time, for the sea is then dis­ <lb/>
            turbed. This is most conspicuous in the Bosphorus ;for <pb n="215"/>
            <note type="margin">B. VIII.] </note> <lb/>
            the mud is thrown up, and the fish are thus brought to the <lb/>
            surface; and they say that, 'hen the bottom is disturbed, <lb/>
            more fish are often taken in the same cast the second than <lb/>
            the first time; and after much rain animals make their <lb/>
            appearance which before were either not seen at all or but <lb/>
            seldom.</p>

          <p>1. MANY kinds of birds also conceal themselves, and they <lb/>
            do not all, as some suppose, migrate to warmer climates; <lb/>
            but those which are near the places of which they are <lb/>
            permanent inhabitants, as the kite and swallow, migrate <lb/>
            thither; but those that are farther off from such places do <lb/>
            not migrate, but conceal themselves; and many swallows <lb/>
            have been seen in hollow places almost stripped of feathers; <lb/>
            and kites, when they first showed themselves, have come <lb/>
            from similar situations. Birds with crooked claws, and <lb/>
            those also with straight claws, conceal themselves indiscri­ <lb/>
            minately ; for the stork, blackbird,1 turtle dove, and lark hide <lb/>
            themselves, and by general agreement the turtle dove most <lb/>
            of all, for no one is ever said to have seen one during the <lb/>
            winter. At the commencement of hybernation it is very fat, <lb/>
            and during that season it loses its feathers, though they <lb/>
            remain thick for a long while. Some of the doves conceal <lb/>
            themselves; others do not, but migrate along with the swal­ <lb/>
            lows. The thrush and the starling also conceal themselves, <lb/>
            and among birds with crooked claws the kite and the owl are <lb/>
            not seen for a few days.</p>

          <p>1. AMONG viviparous quadrupeds the porcupines and bears <lb/>
            hybernate. It is evident that the wild bears conceal them­ <lb/>
            selves ; but there is some doubt whether it is on account of <lb/>
            the cold or from any other cause, for at this season both the <lb/>
            males and females are so fat that they cannot move easily. <lb/>
            The female also produces her young at this season, and hides <lb/>
            herself until the cubs are of an age to be led forth. This <lb/>
            she does in the spring, about three months after the solstice, <lb/>
            and she continues invisible for at least forty days. During <lb/>
            fourteen days of this period they say that she does not move <lb/>
            at all. For more than this period afterwards she remains <note type="footnote"> <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κόττυφος</foreign>, Turdus merula, Strack, blackbird, bu* probably more thaw <lb/>

            <note type="margin">[B. III. </note> <lb/>
            invisible, but moves about and is awake. A pregnant bear <lb/>
            has either never or very rarely been captured; and it is <lb/>
            quite plain that they eat nothing during the whole of this <lb/>
            period; for they never come out; and if they are captured, <lb/>
            their stomach and entrails appear to be empty; and it is <lb/>
            said that, because nothing is presented to it, the intestine <lb/>
            sometimes adheres to itself; and, therefore, at their first <lb/>
            emergence, they eat the arum, in order to open the entrail <lb/>
            and make a passage through it.</p>
          <p>2. The dormouse hybernates in trees and is then very <lb/>
            fat, and the white Pontic mouse. (Some hybernating <lb/>
            animals cast their old age, as it is called. This is the outer <lb/>
            skin and the coverings at the period of birth.) It has al­ <lb/>
            ready been observed, that among viviparous animals with <lb/>
            feet there is some doubt as to the cause of the hybernation <lb/>
            of bears; but almost all animals with scales hybernate and <lb/>
            cast their old age; that is, all that have a soft skin and no <lb/>
            shell, as the tortoise; for both the tortoise and the emys <lb/>
            belong to the class of animals with scales; but all such as <lb/>
            the gecko, lizard, and especially the serpents, cast their <lb/>
            skins; for they do this both in the spring, when they first <lb/>
            emerge, and again in the autumn.</p>
          <p>3. The viper also casts its skin both in the spring and <lb/>
            autumn, and is not, as some persons say, the only serpent <lb/>
            that does not cast its skin. When serpents begin to cast <lb/>
            their skin, it is first of all separated from their eyes ; and to <lb/>
            those who do not know what is about to happen they appear <lb/>
            to be blind. After this it is separated from the head, for <lb/>
            first of all it appears entirely white. In a night and day <lb/>
            the whole of the old skin is separated from the commence­ <lb/>
            ment at the head to the tail; and when cast it is turned in­ <lb/>
            side out, for the serpent emerges as the infant does from <lb/>
            the chorion.</p>
          <p>4. Insects which cast their skins do it in the same way as <lb/>
            the silpha, empis, and the coleoptera, as the beetle. All <lb/>
            creatures cast it after birth; for in viviparous animals the <lb/>
            chorion is separated, and in the vermiparous, as bees and <lb/>
            locusts, they emerge from a case. The grasshoppers, when <lb/>
            they cast their skins, sit upon olives and reeds. When the <lb/>
            case is ruptured, they emerge, and leave a little fluid behind <lb/>
            them, and after a short time they fly away and sing. <pb n="217"/>

          <p><note type="margin">B. VIII.] </note> 5. Among marine creatures the carabi and astaci cast <lb/>
            their skins either in spring or autumn, after having depo­ <lb/>
            sited their ova; and carabi have been sometimes taken with <lb/>
            a soft thorax, because their shell was ruptured, while the <lb/>
            lower part, which was not ruptured, was hard. For the <lb/>
            process is not the same in them as in serpents. The carabi <lb/>
            remain in concealment for about five months. The crabs <lb/>
            also cast their old skin, certainly those which have soft <lb/>
            shells; and they say that those which have hard shells do <lb/>
            the same, as the maia and graus. When they have cast <lb/>
            their shells, the new shells are first of all soft, and the <lb/>
            crabs are unable to walk. They do not cast their skins <lb/>
            once only, but frequently. I have now described when and <lb/>
            how animals conceal themselves, and what creatures cast <lb/>
            their skin, and when they do so.</p>

          <p>1. ANIMALS are not all in good health at the same season, <lb/>
            nor in the same degrees of heat and cold. Their health and <lb/>
            diseases are different at different seasons in various classes, <lb/>
            and on the whole are not alike in all. Dry weather agrees <lb/>
            with birds, both in respect of their general health and the <lb/>
            rearing of their young, and especially with pigeons ; and wet <lb/>
            weather, with few exceptions, agrees with fish. On the con­ <lb/>
            trary, showery weather generally disagrees with birds, and <lb/>
            dry weather with fish; for, on the whole, abundance of drink <lb/>
            does not agree with birds.</p>
          <p>2. For the birds with crooked claws, generally speaking, <lb/>
            as it was before remarked, do not drink. But Hesiod was <lb/>
            ignorant of this circumstance; for in relating the siege <lb/>
            of Nineveh he represents the presiding eagle of the augury <lb/>
            drinking. Other birds drink, but not much; neither do any <lb/>
            other oviparous animals with spongy lungs. The sickness <lb/>
            of birds is manifest in their plumage; for it is uneven, and <lb/>
            has not the same smoothness as when they are well.</p>
          <p>3. The generality of fish, as it was observed, thrive the <lb/>
            most in rainy years; for not only in such seasons do they <lb/>
            obtain a greater supply of food, but the wet weather agrees <lb/>
            with them as with the plants that grow on land; for <lb/>
            potherbs, even if watered, do not grow so well as in wet <lb/>
            weather. The same is the case with the reeds that grow in <pb n="218"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. VIII.</note> <lb/>
            ponds ; for they never grow, as we may say, except in rainy <lb/>
            weather.</p>
          <p>4. And this is the reason why so many fish migrate every <lb/>
            summer into the Pontus; for the number of rivers which <lb/>
            flow into it render the water fresh, and also bring down a <lb/>
            supply of food, and many fish also ascend the rivers, and <lb/>
            flourish in the rivers and lakes, as the amia and mullet. <lb/>
            The cobii also become fat in the rivers; and on the whole, <lb/>
            those places which have the largest lakes furnish the most <lb/>
            excellent fish.</p>
          <p>5. Of all kinds of water, summer showers agree best with <lb/>
            fish; and if the spring, summer, and autumn have been wet, <lb/>
            a fine winter. And to speak generally, if the season is <lb/>
            healthy for mankind, it will be the same for fish. They do <lb/>
            not thrive in cold places. Those which have a stone in their <lb/>
            head, as the chromis, labrax, sciœna, and phagrus, suffer <lb/>
            most in the winter; for the refrigeration of the stone causes <lb/>
            them to freeze and be driven on shore.</p>
          <p>6. Abundant rain confers health on most fish; but the <lb/>
            contrary is the case with the mullet and cephalus, which <lb/>
            some call marinus; for if there is a great supply of rain <lb/>
            water, they soon become blind. The cephali are particu­ <lb/>
            larly liable to this disease in the winter; for their eyes <lb/>
            become white. When captured they are lean, and at last <lb/>
            perish altogether. They do not, however, appear to suffer <lb/>
            so much from the wet as from the cold; for in other places, <lb/>
            and especially in the swamps in the neighbourhood of the <lb/>
            Argive Nauplia, many are found blind in severe weather, and <lb/>
            many also are taken with white eyes.</p>
          <p>7. The chrysophrys also suffers from the cold; the arach­ <lb/>
            nas from the heat, which makes it lean. Dry seasons agree <lb/>
            better with the coracinus than with any other fish, and for <lb/>
            this reason, because it is generally warm in dry weather. <lb/>
            Particular localities are favourable to different species, as <lb/>
            either the neighbourhood of the land, or the deep waters to <lb/>
            those which only frequent one of these localities, or parti­ <lb/>
            cular places to those which frequent both. There are <lb/>
            especial places in which each of them thrive; but, gene­ <lb/>
            rally speaking, they prefer places full of sea weed; for <lb/>
            those which inhabit places with plenty of food are generally <unclear/> <lb/>
            found to be fatter; for those that eat fuci obtain plenty of <pb n="219"/>
             <note type="margin">B. VIII.]</note> <lb/>
            food, while those that are carnivorous find an abundant <lb/>
            supply of fish.</p>
          <p>8. They are also affected by northern and southern aspects, <lb/>
            for the long fish thrive best in northern situations, and <lb/>
            in northern places in the summer time more long fish <lb/>
            than flat fish are taken in the same locality. The tunny <lb/>
            and xiphia suffer from the oestrus, at the rising of the dog- <lb/>
            star, for both these fish at this season have beneath their <lb/>
            fins a little worm which is called oestrus, which resembles a <lb/>
            scorpion, and is about the size of a spider; they suffer so <lb/>
            much from this torment that the xiphias leaps out of the sea <lb/>
            as high as the dolphin, and in this manner frequently falls <lb/>
            upon ships.</p>
          <p>9. The tunny delights in warm weather more than any <lb/>
            other fish, and they resort to the sand near the sea-shore for <lb/>
            the sake of the warmth, and there they float on the surface ; <lb/>
            the small fish are safe because they are overlooked, for large <lb/>
            fish pursue those of a moderate size. The greater portion of <lb/>
            the ova and melt are destroyed .. . . . by the heat, for <lb/>
            whatever they touch they entirely destroy.</p>
          <p>10. The greatest number of fish are taken before sunrise <lb/>
            and after sunset, or just about sunrise and sunset, for the <lb/>
            casts made at this period are called seasonable. For this <lb/>
            reason the fishermen take up their nets at this time, for <lb/>
            the sight of the fish is then most readily deceived. During <lb/>
            the night they remain quiet, and at mid-day, when the <lb/>
            light is strong, they see very well.</p>
          <p>11. Fish do not appear to be subject to any of those pesti­ <lb/>
            lential diseases which so often occur among men and quad­ <lb/>
            rupeds, as the horse and ox, and other animals, both domestic <lb/>
            and wild. They appear, however, to suffer from ill health, <lb/>
            and the fishermen consider that this is proved by the capture <lb/>
            of some lean, and apparently weak individuals, and others <lb/>
            that have lost their colour, among a number of fat ones of <lb/>
            the same kind. This is the nature of sea-fish.</p>
          <p>12. No pestilential disease attacks river and pond fish, <lb/>
            though some of them are subject to peculiar diseases, as the <lb/>
            giants, from its swimming near the surface, appears to be <lb/>
            star-struck by the dog-star, and it is stupefied by loud <lb/>
            thunder. The carp suffers in the same way, but not so <lb/>
            severely. The glanis, in shallow water, is often destroyed <pb n="220"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. VIII </note> <lb/>
            by the dragon-serpent. In the ballerus and tilon a worm is <lb/>
            produced, under the influence of the dog-star, which makes <lb/>
            them rise to the surface and become weak, and when they <lb/>
            come to the surface they are killed by the heat; a violent dis­ <lb/>
            ease attacks the chalets, which is destroyed by a number of <lb/>
            lice, which are produced under its gills; no other fish appear <lb/>
            to be subject to such a disease.</p>
          <p>13. Fishes are poisoned with the plant called mullein, for <lb/>
            which reason some persons capture them by poisoning the <lb/>
            waters of rivers and ponds; and the Phœnicians poison the <lb/>
            sea in the same way. There are two other plans which are <lb/>
            adopted for the capture of fish; for since fish avoid the deep <lb/>
            parts of rivers in cold weather (for even otherwise the river <lb/>
            water is cold), they dig a ditch through the land to the river, <lb/>
            which they cover over with grass and stones so as to resemble <lb/>
            a cave, with one opening from the river, and when the frost <lb/>
            comes on they capture the fish with a basket. The other mode <lb/>
            of fishing is practised both in summer and winter. In the <lb/>
            middle of the stream they raise a structure with faggots and <lb/>
            stones, leaving one part open for a mouth; in this a basket <lb/>
            is placed, with which they catch the fish, as they take away <lb/>
            the stones.</p>
          <p>14. Rainy years agree with all the testacea except the pur­ <lb/>
            pura; this is a proof of it, if placed near the mouth of a <lb/>
            river, they take the fresh water, and die the same day. The <lb/>
            purpura will live about fifty days after it has been taken. <lb/>
            They are nourished by each other, for a plant like a fucus <lb/>
            or moss grows upon their shells. They say that whatever is <lb/>
            cast to them for food is done for the sake of weight, that <lb/>
            they may weigh the more.</p>
          <p>15. Dry weather is injurious to other testacea, for it <lb/>
            renders them fewer in quantity and inferior in quality, and the <lb/>
            pectens become more red. In the Pyrrhæan Euripus the pec­ <lb/>
            tens perish, not only from the instrument with which the <lb/>
            fishermen scrape them together, but also from dry weather. <lb/>
            The other testacea thrive in wet weather, because it makes <lb/>
            the sea-water fresher. The cold of the Pontus and of the <lb/>
            rivers that flow into it renders bivalve shells rare. The uni­ <lb/>
            valves, however, are frozen in cold weather. This is the <lb/>
            nature of aquatic animals. <pb n="221"/>

          <p><unclear>1</unclear>. AMONG quadrupeds, swine suffer from three diseases, one <lb/>
            of these is called sore throat, in which the parts above the <lb/>
            jaws and the branchia become inflamed; it may also occur in <lb/>
            other parts of the body, and frequently seizes upon the foot, <lb/>
            and sometimes the ear. The neighbouring parts then be­ <lb/>
            come putrid, until it reaches the lungs, when the animal dies ; <lb/>
            the disease spreads rapidly, and the animal eats nothing from <lb/>
            the period of the commencement of the disease, be it where <lb/>
            it will. The swineherds have no other remedy but the <lb/>
            excision of the part before the disease has spread far.</p>
          <p>2. There are two other diseases which are both called <lb/>
            craura. One of them consists in a pain and weight in the <lb/>
            head, with which many of them are afflicted ; the other is <lb/>
            an excessive alvine discharge. This appears to be incurable. <lb/>
            They relieve the former by the application of wine to the <lb/>
            nostrils, and washing them with wine. Recovery from this <lb/>
            disease is difficult, for it generally carries them off on the <lb/>
            third or fourth day.</p>
          <p>3. They suffer particularly from sore throat, when the <lb/>
            summer bears abundantly, and they are fat. The fruit of <lb/>
            the mulberry is good for them, and abundant washings <lb/>
            with warm water, and scarification beneath the tongue. <lb/>
            If the flesh of swine is soft, it is full of small lumps <lb/>
            (chalazae) about the legs, neck, and shoulders; for in these <lb/>
            parts the chalazæ are most frequent. If there are but a few, <lb/>
            the flesh is sweet; if many, it becomes very fluid and soft.</p>
          <p>4. Those which have these chalazæ are easily distinguished; <lb/>
            for they exist in the greatest numbers under the tongue, <lb/>
            and if the hair is plucked from their mane it appears <lb/>
            bloody underneath. Those which have chalazæ cannot keep <lb/>
            their hind legs still. They are not thus affected as long as <lb/>
            they suck. The grain called tipha, which also forms excel­ <lb/>
            lent food, is the remedy for the chalazæ. Vetches and figs <lb/>
            are useful both fcr fattening and rearing pigs; and on the <lb/>
            whole their food should not be all of one sort, but varied; <lb/>
            for swine, like other animals, derive advantage from a <lb/>
            change in their food; and they say that at the same time <lb/>
            their food ought to inflate them, and to cover them both <lb/>
            with flesh and fat, Acorns are good for their food, but <pb n="222"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. VIII.</note> <lb/>
            make their flesh watery; and if they eat too many while <lb/>
            pregnant, they produce abortions, as sheep also do; for <lb/>
            these animals evidently suffer this from eating acorns. <lb/>
            The swine is the only creature that we know of which <lb/>
            has chalazæ in its flesh.</p>

          <p>1. DOGS suffer from these diseases which have received these <lb/>
            names, lytta, cynanche, podagra. The lytta produces mad­ <lb/>
            ness, and they infect every creature which they bite, except <lb/>
            mankind, with the same disease. This disease is fatal to <lb/>
            dogs and to any other animal they may bite except man. <lb/>
            The cynanche also is fatal to dogs; and there are compara­ <lb/>
            tively few which recover from the podagra. Camels also are <lb/>
            seized with lytta. (The elephant does not appear to suffer <lb/>
            from any other infirmity except flatulency.)</p>
          <p>2. Gregarious oxen suffer from two diseases, one called <lb/>
            podagra, the other craurus. The podagra affects their feet; <lb/>
            but it is not fatal, nor do they lose their hoofs. They derive <lb/>
            benefit from their horns being smeared with warm pitch. <lb/>
            When attacked with craurus, their breathing becomes warm <lb/>
            and thick. Fever in mankind is the same as craurus in cattle. <lb/>
            It is a sign of this disease, when they hang down their ears <lb/>
            and will not eat. It soon proves fatal, and when dissected, <lb/>
            their lungs appear putrid.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XXIII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. HORSES when grazing are free from all diseases except <lb/>
            podagra; from this they suffer, and sometimes lose their <lb/>
            hoofs, which grow again as soon as they are lost, and the loss <lb/>
            of the hoof usually takes place as soon as the first recom­ <lb/>
            mences its growth. It is a sign of the disease when the <lb/>
            right testicle throbs, or when a wrinkled hollow place appears <lb/>
            a little below the middle of the nose. Horses that are brought <lb/>
            up in a domestic state suffer from several other diseases; <lb/>
            they are attacked with a disorder in their bowels, and it is <lb/>
            a sign of the disease when they drag their hind legs up to <lb/>
            their fore legs, and keep them under in such a way that they <lb/>
            almost strike together: if they go mad after having ab. <lb/>
            stained from food for several days, they are relieved by <lb/>
            bleeding and castration.1</p>
          <p>2. The tetanus is another disease of horses, which is thus <note type="footnote">1 The passage is altogether corrupt. </note> <pb n="223"/>
            <note type="margin">B. VIII.] </note> <lb/>
            recognised; all the veins, and the head and neck are extended, <lb/>
            and their legs are stiff when they walk; the horses also become <lb/>
            full of corrupt matter. They are also attacked by another <lb/>
            disease in which they are said to have the crithia ;l the soft­ <lb/>
            ness of the roof of the mouth, and heated breath, are the <lb/>
            signs of this disease, which is incurable, unless it stays of <lb/>
            its own accord. Another disease is called nymphia,2 which <lb/>
            is relieved by the sound of a flute ; it causes them to hang <lb/>
            down their heads, and when anyone mounts they rush for­ <lb/>
            ward until they run against something. The horse is always <lb/>
            dejected if afflicted with madness ; this is a sign of it, if <lb/>
            it lays down its ears upon its mane, and then draws them <lb/>
            forward, and pants and breathes hard.</p>
          <p>3. These also are incurable if the heart is affected. It is <lb/>
            a sign of this disease if the animal suffers from relax­ <lb/>
            ation. And if the bladder alters its position, difficulty in <lb/>
            making water is a sign of this disease; it draws up the hoofs <lb/>
            and loins. It is also fatal for the horse to swallow the sta. <lb/>
            philinus, which is of the same size as the spondyla. The <lb/>
            bite of the shrew mouse is injurious to other animals also; <lb/>
            it causes sores, which are more severe if the creature is preg­ <lb/>
            nant when it bites, for the sores then break. If they are not <lb/>
            pregnant, the animal does not perish. The creature called <lb/>
            cbalkis by some persons and zygnis by others, inflicts either <lb/>
            a fatal or very painful bite. It resembles a small lizard, and <lb/>
            is of the same colour as the serpent called the blind worm.</p>
          <p>4. And, on the whole, those who understand horses say <lb/>
            that both these animals and sheep suffer from all the in­ <lb/>
            firmities with which mankind is afflicted. The horse, and <lb/>
            every other beast of burden, is destroyed by the poison of <lb/>
            sandarach.3 It is dissolved in water and strained. The <lb/>
            pregnant mare casts her young with the smell of a lamp going <lb/>
            out. This also happens to some pregnant women. This is <lb/>
            the nature of the diseases of horses.</p>
          <p>5. The hippomanes, as it is called, is said to be produced <lb/>
            upon the foals ; the mares when they have bitten it off lick the <lb/>
            foal and cleanse it. The fables on this subject have been in­ <lb/>
            vented by women and charmers. It is, however, agreed that <lb/>
            mares before parturition eject the substance called potion.</p>
          <p>6. Horses recognise again the voices of any with which <note type="footnote">1 Indigestion caused by eating barley when heated. </note><note type="footnote">2 </note><note type="footnote">3 Red sulphuret of arsenic. </note> <pb n="224"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. VIII </note> <lb/>
            they may have fought. They delight in meadows and <lb/>
            marshes, and drink dirty water; and if it is clean, they first <lb/>
            disturb it with their hoof, and then drink and wash them­ <lb/>
            selves. And on the whole, the horse is an animal fond of <lb/>
            water, and still more fond of moisture ; wherefore, also, <lb/>
            the nature of the river-horse is thus constituted. In this <lb/>
            respect the ox is very different from the horse, for it will <lb/>
            not drink unless the water is clean, cold, and unmixed.</p>

          <p>1. ASSES only suffer from one disease, which is called melis, <lb/>
            which first attacks the head of the animal, and causes a <lb/>
            thick and bloody phlegm to flow from the nostrils. If the <lb/>
            disease extends to the lungs, it is fatal; but that which first <lb/>
            attacks the head is not so. This animal cannot bear cold, <lb/>
            for which reason there are no asses in the vicinity of the <lb/>
            Pontus and in Scythia.</p>

          <p>1. ELEPHANTS suffer from flatulent diseases, for which <lb/>
            reason they can neither evacuate their fluid or solid excre­ <lb/>
            ments. If they eat earth they become weak, unless used <lb/>
            to such food. If it is accustomed to it, it does no harm. <lb/>
            Sometimes the elephant swallows stones. It also suffers­ <lb/>
            from diarrhoea. When attacked with this complaint, they are <lb/>
            cured by giving them warm water to drink, and hay dipped <lb/>
            in honey to eat; and either of these remedies will stop the <lb/>
            disease. When fatigued for want of sleep, they are cured <lb/>
            by being rubbed on the shoulders with salt and oil, and <lb/>
            warm water. When they suffer from pain in the shoulders, <lb/>
            they are relieved by the application of roasted swine's <lb/>
            flesh. Some elephants will drink oil, and some will not; <lb/>
            and if any iron weapon is struck into their body, the oil <lb/>
            which they drink assists in its expulsion; and to those <lb/>
            which will not drink it, they give wine of rice cooked with <lb/>
            oil. This, then, is the nature of quadrupeds.</p>

          <p>1. INSECTS generally thrive when the year is of the same <lb/>
            kind as the season in which they were born, such as the <lb/>
            spring, moist and warm. Certain creatures are produced <pb n="225"/>
            <note type="margin">B. VIII.]</note> <lb/>
            in beehives, which destroy the combs, and a little spinning <lb/>
            worm, which destroys the wax. It is called clerus, or by <lb/>
            some persons pyraustes. This creature produces a spider­ <lb/>
            like animal like itself, which causes sickness in the hive, <lb/>
            and another creature like the moth, which flies round the <lb/>
            candle. This produces a creature filled with a woolly sub­ <lb/>
            stance. It is not killed by the bees, and is only driven out <lb/>
            by smoking it. A kind of caterpillar also, which is called <lb/>
            teredo, is produced in the hives. The bees do not drive it <lb/>
            away. They suffer most from diseases when the woods <lb/>
            produce flowers infected with rust, and in dry seasons. All <lb/>
            insects die when plunged in oil, and most rapidly if their <lb/>
            head is oiled, and they are placed in the sun.</p>

          <p>1. ANIMALS also differ in their localities : for some are en­ <lb/>
            tirely absent from some localities which exist in others, <lb/>
            though small and shortlived, and not thriving. And fre­ <lb/>
            quently there will be a great difference even in adjoining <lb/>
            places, as the grasshopper is found in some parts of Milesia, <lb/>
            and is absent from those in the immediate vicinity. And in <lb/>
            Cephalenia a river divides the country, on one side of which <lb/>
            the grasshopper is found, and not on the other.</p>
          <p>2. In Poroselene a road divides the country, on one side <lb/>
            of which the weasel is found, and not on the other. In <lb/>
            Bœotia there are many moles in the neighbourhood of <lb/>
            Orchomenus, but in the adjoining Lebadian district there <lb/>
            are none, nor if they are imported, are they willing to bar­ <lb/>
            row. If hares are taken into Ithaca they will not live, <lb/>
            but are seen dead on the sea coast, turned in the direction <lb/>
            in which they were brought. In Sicily the hippomyrmex <lb/>
            is not found, and in Cyrene there were formerly no croak­ <lb/>
            ing frogs.</p>
          <p>3. In all Libya there is neither wild boar, nor stag, nor <lb/>
            wild goat. And in India, Ctesias, who is not worthy of <lb/>
            credit, says, there are neither domestic nor wild swine ; but <lb/>
            the exsanguineous and burrowing tribes are all large. In <lb/>
            the Pontus there are no malacia, nor all the kinds of tes­ <lb/>
            tacea, except in a few places; but in the Red Sea all the <lb/>
            testacea are of a great size. In Syria there are sheep with <lb/>
            tails a cubit in width, and the ears of the goats are a span <note type="footnote">iQ </note> <pb n="226"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. VIII.</note> <lb/>
            and four fingers, and some of them bring their ears down <lb/>
            to the ground: and the oxen, like the camels, have a mane <lb/>
            upon the point of the shoulder. In Lycia the goats are <lb/>
            shorn as the sheep are in other places.</p>
          <p>4. In Libya the horned rams are born at once with horns, <lb/>
            and not the males only, as Homer says, but all the rest also. <lb/>
            In the part of Scythia near the Pontus, the contrary is the <lb/>
            case, for they are born without horns. And in Egypt some <lb/>
            of the cattle, as the oxen and sheep, are larger than in <lb/>
            Greece, and others are smaller, as the dogs, wolves, hares, <lb/>
            foxes, ravens, and hawks. Others are nearly of the same <lb/>
            size, as the crows and goats. This difference originates in <lb/>
            the food which is abundant for some, and scarce for others. <lb/>
            For the wolves, hawks, and carnivorous creatures food is <lb/>
            scarce, for there are but few small birds. For the dasypus <lb/>
            and others which are not carnivorous, neither the hard nor <lb/>
            soft fruits are of any long continuance.</p>
          <p>5 The temperature is also very influential; for in Illy. <lb/>
            ria, Thrace, and Epirus, the asses are small. In Scythia, <lb/>
            and Celtic countries, they do not occur at all, for in these <lb/>
            places the winter is severe. In Arabia the lizards are more <lb/>
            than a cubit long, and the mice are much larger than those <lb/>
            which inhabit our fields, their fore legs being a span long, <lb/>
            and their hind legs as long as from the first joint of the <lb/>
            finger. . . .</p>
          <p>6. In Libya, the serpents, as it has been already remarked, <lb/>
            are very large. For some persons say that as they sailed <lb/>
            along the coast, they saw the bones of many oxen, and that <lb/>
            It was evident to them that they had been devoured by the <lb/>
            serpents. And as the ships passed on, the serpents attacked <lb/>
            the triremes, and some of them threw themselves upon one <lb/>
            of the triremes and overturned it. There are more lions in <lb/>
            Europe, and especially in the country between the Ache­ <lb/>
            lous and the Nessus. In Asia there are leopards which <lb/>
            are not found in Europe.</p>
          <p>7. On the whole, the wild animals of Asia are the fiercest, <lb/>
            those of Europe the boldest, and those of Libya the most <lb/>
            varied in form ; and it has passed into a proverb that Libya <lb/>
            is always producing something new. For the want of <lb/>
            water brings many heterogeneous animals together at the <lb/>
            drinking places, where they copulate and produce young, if <pb n="227"/>
            <note type="margin">B. VIII.]</note> <lb/>
            their periods of gestation happen to be the same, and their <lb/>
            size not very different. The desire of drinking makes them <lb/>
            gentle to each other, for they differ from the animals of other <lb/>
            countries, in wanting to drink more in winter than in sum­ <lb/>
            mer; for on account of the great want of water during the <lb/>
            summer they are habituated to do without water; and if <lb/>
            the mice drink they die.</p>
          <p>8. Other animals are produced by the intercourse of <lb/>
            heterogeneous creatures, as in Cyrene the wolves copulate <lb/>
            with the dogs, and produce young; and the Laconian dogs <lb/>
            are bred between a dog and a fox. They say that the In­ <lb/>
            dian dogs are derived from the tiger and the dog; not di. <lb/>
            rectly, but from the third mixture of the breeds; for they <lb/>
            say that the first race was very fierce. They take the dogs <lb/>
            and tie them up in the desert. Many of them are devoured, <lb/>
            if the wild animal does not happen to desire sexual inter­ <lb/>
            course.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XXVIII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. DIFFERENT localities produce a variety of dispositions, <lb/>
            as mountainous and rough places, or smooth plains. They <lb/>
            are more fierce and robust in appearance in mountains, as the <lb/>
            swine of Athos; for the males of those which inhabit the <lb/>
            plains cannot endure even the females of the other kind: and <lb/>
            different situations have great influence on the bite of wild <lb/>
            animals. All the scorpions about Pharus and other places <lb/>
            are not painful, but in Caria and other localities they are <lb/>
            frequent, and large, and fierce, and their sting is fatal to <lb/>
            either man or beast, even to sows, which are but little influ­ <lb/>
            enced by the bite of other creatures, and black sows <lb/>
            are more easily affected than others. The swine die very <lb/>
            soon after being stung, if they come near the water.</p>
          <p>2. The bite also of serpents varies much; for in Libya <lb/>
            the asp is found, from which they form a septic poison, <lb/>
            which is incurable. In the plant silphium is found a small <lb/>
            serpent, for the bite of which a remedy has been discovered <lb/>
            in a small stone, which is taken out of the tomb of one of <lb/>
            the ancient kings: this they drink dipped in wine. In <lb/>
            some parts of Italy the bite of the gecko is found to be <lb/>
            fatal. If one poisonous animal eats another, as, if a <note type="footnote">1 Probably assafœtida. </note><note type="footnote"/> <note type="footnote"> Q 2 </note> <pb n="228"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. VIII.</note> <lb/>
            viper eats a scorpion, its bite is the most fatal of all. <lb/>
            The saliva of a man is hostile to most of them. There <lb/>
            is one small serpent, which some persons call hierus, <lb/>
            which is avoided even by large serpents. It is a cubit <lb/>
            long, and appears rough. Whatsoever it bites imme­ <lb/>
            mediately becomes putrid in a circle round the wound. <lb/>
            There is also a small serpent in India, the only one for <lb/>
            which there is no remedy.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XXIX.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. ANIMALS also differ in being in good condition or not <lb/>
            during gestation. The testacea, as the pectens and the ma­ <lb/>
            lacostraca, as the carabi and such like, are best when preg­ <lb/>
            nant; for this word is also used of the testacea. For the <lb/>
            malacostraca have been observed both in the act of copula­ <lb/>
            tion and oviposition ; but none of the testacea have ever <lb/>
            been seen so occupied. The malacia, such as the teuthis, <lb/>
            sepia, and polypus, are most excellent when pregnant; and <lb/>
            almost all fish are good during the early part of the period; <lb/>
            but as the time advances some are good and some not so.</p>
          <p>2. The mænis thrives during gestation. The form of the <lb/>
            female is round, that of the male longer and broader. And <lb/>
            when the period of gestation commences in the females, the <lb/>
            males become black and variegated, and are not fit to eat. <lb/>
            Some persons call them tragi at this period. Those which <lb/>
            are called cottyphus and cichla also change their colour; <lb/>
            and the caris also changes at this season and some birds, <lb/>
            which are black in spring and afterwards become white.</p>
          <p>3. The phycis also changes its colour; for it is white at <lb/>
            all other seasons, and variegated in the spring. This is the <lb/>
            only sea fish that, as they say, makes a nest in which <lb/>
            it deposits its ova. The mænis, as it was before ob­ <lb/>
            served, and the smaris also change their colours, and from <lb/>
            being white in summer become black. This is particu­ <lb/>
            larly conspicuous about the fins and gills. The coracinus <lb/>
            is best when pregnant, and so is the mænis. The cestreus, <lb/>
            labrax, and nearly all creatures that swim are inferior at this <lb/>
            season.</p>
          <p>4. There are a few which are good, whether pregnant or <lb/>
            not, as the glaucus. Old fish also are inferior; and old <lb/>
            tunnies are not even fit for salting, for much of the flesh is <pb n="229"/>
            <note type="margin">B. VIII.]</note> <lb/>
            dissolved. The same thing also happens with other fish. <lb/>
            The older fish are distinguished by the size and hardness <lb/>
            of their scales; an old tunny has been taken which weighed <lb/>
            fifteen talents, and the length of the tail was two cubits <lb/>
            and a span.</p>
          <p>5. River and pond fish are most excellent, after depositing <lb/>
            their ova and semen, and recovering their flesh. Some of <lb/>
            them, however, are good while pregnant, as the saperdis; <lb/>
            and others bad, as the glanis. In all the male is better than <lb/>
            the female; but the female glanis is better than the male. <lb/>
            Those which they call female eels are better than the males. <lb/>
            They call them females, though they are not so, but only <lb/>
            differ in appearance. <pb n="230"/>

          <p>1. THE dispositions of obscure and short-lived animals are <lb/>
            less easily observed than those of long-lived animals; for <lb/>
            they appear to have a certain inclination towards each na­ <lb/>
            tural affection of the soul, such as prudence and folly, <lb/>
            courage and cowardice, mildness and cruelty, and such other <lb/>
            habits. Some also, which have the sense of hearing, appear <lb/>
            to be capable of a certain degree of instruction and disci­ <lb/>
            pline, both from one another and from mankind, for they <lb/>
            not only distinguish the difference of sounds but also of <lb/>
            signs.</p>
          <p>2. And in all animals in which there is a distinction of <lb/>
            the sexes nature has given a similar disposition to the males <lb/>
            and to the females. This is most conspicuous in man, and <lb/>
            the larger animals, and in viviparous quadrupeds; for the <lb/>
            disposition of the female is softer, and more tameable and <lb/>
            submissive, and more ingenious; as the females of the Lace­ <lb/>
            demonian dog are more gentle than the males. In the <lb/>
            Molossian race of dogs, those employed in hunting differ in <lb/>
            no respect from other dogs; while those employed in fol­ <lb/>
            lowing sheep are larger and more fierce in their attack on <lb/>
            wild beasts. A mixture of the Molossian and Lacedemonian <lb/>
            races is both braver and more capable of enduring fatigue.</p>
          <p>3. The females of all animals are less violent in their <lb/>
            passions than the males, except the female bear and pardalis, <lb/>
            for the female of these appears more courageous than the <lb/>
            male. In other animals the females are more soft and insi. <lb/>
            dious, less simple, more petulant, and more active in the <lb/>
            care of their young. The disposition of the males is opposed <lb/>
            to this; for they are more passionate and fierce, more straight- <lb/>
            forward, and less invidious. The vestiges of these disposi­ <lb/>
            tions exist, as we may say, in all, but are more conspicuous <lb/>
            in those which have the strongest moral habits, and most of <pb n="231"/>
            <note type="margin">B. IX.] </note> <lb/>
            all in mankind; for the nature of the human subject is the <lb/>
            most complete, so that these habits appear more conspicuous <lb/>
            in mankind than in other animals.</p>
          <p>4. Wherefore women are more compassionate and more <lb/>
            readily made to weep, more jealous and querulous, more <lb/>
            fond of railing, and more contentious. The female also is more <lb/>
            subject to depression of spirits and despair than the male. <lb/>
            She is also more shameless and false, more readily deceived, <lb/>
            and more mindful of injury, more watchful, more idle, and <lb/>
            on the whole less excitable than the male. On the contrary, <lb/>
            the male is more ready to help, and, as it has been said, <lb/>
            more brave than the female; and even in the malacia, if the <lb/>
            sepia is struck with a trident, the male comes to help the <lb/>
            female, but the female makes her escape if the male is <lb/>
            struck.</p>

          <p>1. ANIMALS often fight with each other, particularly those <lb/>
            which inhabit the same places and eat the same food; for <lb/>
            when food becomes scarce, congeners fight together. They <lb/>
            say that seals which occupy the same locality will fight, the <lb/>
            males with the males and the females with the females, until <lb/>
            one party is either killed or ejected by the other, and their <lb/>
            cubs also will fight in the same way. All animals also will <lb/>
            fight with carnivorous creatures, and these will fight with <lb/>
            other animals, for they feed upon living creatures; for which <lb/>
            reason augurs observe the disputes and agreements of <lb/>
            animals, considering that their disputes betoken war, and <lb/>
            their agreements peace with each other.</p>
          <p>2. When supplied with plenty of food, animals that are <lb/>
            naturally afraid of man and fierce appear to submit them­ <lb/>
            selves to him, and to conduct themselves quietly towards <lb/>
            each other. The care which is taken of animals in Egypt <lb/>
            demonstrates this circumstance; for even the fiercest crea­ <lb/>
            tures live together, when they have food enough, and are <lb/>
            not in any want; for they become tame from the supply of <lb/>
            their wants which they receive, as the crocodiles are tamed <lb/>
            by the priests by the care which is bestowed on their food. <lb/>
            The same thing may be observed in other countries and in <lb/>
            their different parts.</p>
          <p>3. The eagle and the dragon are enemies, for the eagle <lb/>
            feeds on serpents. The ichneumon and the spider are alac <pb n="232"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. IX.</note> <lb/>
            enemies, for the ichneumon hunts the spider. Among birds <lb/>
            the pœcilis and the lark and the wood-pecker and chloreus <lb/>
            are enemies, for they eat each others' eggs. The crow and <lb/>
            the owl also are enemies; for at mid-day the crow, taking <lb/>
            advantage of the dim sight of the owl, secretly seizes and <lb/>
            devours its eggs, and the owl eats those of the crow during <lb/>
            the night; and one of these is master during the day, the <lb/>
            other during the night. The owl and orchilus are enemies; <lb/>
            for the latter eats the eggs of the owl. During the day <lb/>
            other birds fly round the owl, which is called " astonishing <lb/>
            it," and as they fly round it pluck off its feathers. For this <lb/>
            reason fowlers use it in hunting for all kinds of birds.</p>
          <p>4. The presbys contends with the weasel and crow, for <lb/>
            they eat its eggs and young. The turtle and pyrallis are <lb/>
            foes, for their food and mode of life are the same. The <lb/>
            celeus and libyus, kite and raven are enemies; for the <lb/>
            kite, from the superiority of its claws and flight, can <lb/>
            take from the raven anything it may have caught, so that <lb/>
            their food is the cause of their enmity also. Those that <lb/>
            obtain their food from the sea also are foes, as the brenthus, <lb/>
            larus, and harpa. The triorches is a foe to the toad and <lb/>
            the serpent; for the triorches eats the others. The turtle <lb/>
            and chloreus are foes, for the chloreus kills the turtle, and <lb/>
            the crow kills the bird called typanus. The little owl and <lb/>
            all other birds with crooked claws eat the calaris, from <lb/>
            whence their enmity arises.</p>
          <p>5. The gecko and the spider are enemies, for the gecko <lb/>
            eats spiders. The pipo is a foe to the heron, for it de. <lb/>
            vours the eggs and young of the heron. Enmity also exists <lb/>
            between the ægithus and the ass; for the ass frequents thorny <lb/>
            places, that it may scratch its sores, and by this means, and <lb/>
            when it brays it overturns the eggs and young of the ægithus, <lb/>
            for they fall out of the nest from fear of the noise, and the bird, <lb/>
            to revenge this injury, flies upon the ass and inflicts wounds. <lb/>
            The wolf is the enemy of the ass, bull, and fox; for being a <lb/>
            carnivorous animal, it attacks both oxen, asses, and foxes. <lb/>
            The fox and circus are enemies for the same reason; for <lb/>
            the circus having crooked claws, and being carnivorous, <lb/>
            attacks and inflicts wounds with its claws.</p>
          <p>6. The raven is an enemy to the bull and ass, for it flies <lb/>
            round them and strikes their eyes. The eagle and the heron <pb n="233"/>
             <note type="margin">B. IX.]</note> <lb/>
            are foes, for the eagle has crooked claws and attacks it, <lb/>
            and the other dies in defending itself. The æsalon is a foe <lb/>
            to the vulture, and the crex to the coleus, blackbird, and <lb/>
            chlorion, which some persons fabulously say derives its <lb/>
            origin from a funeral pile, for it destroys both themselves and <lb/>
            their young. The sitta and trochilus are foes to the eagle, <lb/>
            and the eagle, as well for this reason, as because it is carni­ <lb/>
            vorous, is a foe to them all.</p>
          <p>7. The anthus is the enemy of the horse, for it drives the <lb/>
            horse from its pasture, for the anthus also feeds on grass; <lb/>
            it is dim-sighted and not quick; it imitates the voice of the <lb/>
            horse, which it frightens by flying at it, and drives it from <lb/>
            its pasture; if the horse can seize upon it, he will kill it. The <lb/>
            anthus lives near rivers and marshes ; it is of a fine colour, <lb/>
            and lives well. The ass attacks the colota, a creature which <lb/>
            lives in the manger, and prevents it from eating, by making <lb/>
            its way into its nostrils.</p>
          <p>8. There are three kinds of heron, the black, the white <lb/>
            sort, and the one called asterias; of these, the black rests <lb/>
            and copulates with difficulty, for it utters a cry, and, as they <lb/>
            say, bleeds from the eyes during coition, and the process of <lb/>
            parturition is severe and painful; it attacks creatures which <lb/>
            injure it, as the eagle, for it seizes upon it, and the fox, for <lb/>
            this creature attacks it during the night, and the lark, <lb/>
            which steals its eggs.</p>
          <p>9. The serpent is an enemy to the weasel and the hog, <lb/>
            for if the weasel and serpent live in the same house they <lb/>
            both require the same kind of food; and swine eat serpents. <lb/>
            The æsalon is a foe to the fox, for it strikes and pecks it, and <lb/>
            destroys its young, for it has crooked claws. The raven and <lb/>
            the fox are friendly, for the raven also attacks the æsalon, <lb/>
            and so they help each other in the attack. The little owl <lb/>
            and the æsalon are mutual foes, for both have crooked claws. <lb/>
            The little owl and the swan attack the eagle, and the swan <lb/>
            often comes off victorious. Of all birds the swans are most <lb/>
            disposed to devour1 each other.</p>
          <p>10. Some animals are always ready to attack each other, <lb/>
            and others, as mankind, only at particular times. The ass <lb/>
            and the acanthis are foes, for the latter feeds entirely on <lb/>
            thorns, but the former only when they are tender. The an- <note type="footnote">1 To fight with each other.-See Liddell and Scott's Lexicon, a. v <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">αλληλομάχος</foreign>. </note> <pb n="234"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. IX.</note> <lb/>
            thus, acanthis, and ægithus are foes, and it is said that the <lb/>
            blood of the anthus and ægithus will not mix. The crow <lb/>
            and heron are friends, and so are the schœnion, lark, <lb/>
            laëdus, and celeus, for the celeus lives by the side of rivers <lb/>
            and thickets, but the laëdus lives among rocks and moun­ <lb/>
            tains, and is fond of the place in which it lives. The <lb/>
            piphinx, harpa, and kite are friends; the fox and the ser­ <lb/>
            pent also, for both live in holes ; and the blackbird and the <lb/>
            turtle.</p>
          <p>11. The lion and jackal are foes, for both are carnivo­ <lb/>
            rous, and live on the same substances. Elephants also <lb/>
            fight fiercely with each other, and strike with their tusks ; <lb/>
            the conquered submits entirely, and cannot endure the voice <lb/>
            of the victor: and elephants differ much in the courage <lb/>
            they exhibit. The Indians use both male and female ele­ <lb/>
            phants in war, though the females are smaller and far less <lb/>
            courageous. The elephant can overthrow walls by striking <lb/>
            them with its large tusks; it throws down palm trees by <lb/>
            striking them with its head, and afterwards putting its feet <lb/>
            upon them, stretches them on the ground.</p>
          <p>12. Elephant-hunting is conducted in the following way: <lb/>
            men mount upon some tame courageous animals; when they <lb/>
            have seized upon the wild animals they command the others <lb/>
            to beat them till they fail from fatigue. The elephant-driver <lb/>
            then leaps upon its back and directs it with a lance ; very <lb/>
            soon after this they become tame and obedient. When the <lb/>
            elephant-drivers mount upon them they all become obedient, <lb/>
            but when they have no driver, some are tame and others <lb/>
            not so, and they bind the fore legs of those that are <lb/>
            wild with chains, in order to keep them quiet. They hunt <lb/>
            both full-grown animals and young ones. Such is the <lb/>
            friendship and enmity of these wild animals originating in <lb/>
            the supply of food, and the mode of life.</p>

          <p>1. SOME fish are gregarious and friendly together, others <lb/>
            that are less gregarious are hostile. Some are gregarious while <lb/>
            they are pregnant, others during the season of parturition. On <lb/>
            the whole, the following are gregarious: the tunny, mœnis, <lb/>
            cobius, box, saurus, coracinus, sinodon, trigla, muræna, <lb/>
            anthia, eleginus, atherinus, sarginus, belona, (mecon,) teuthus <pb n="235"/>
            <note type="margin">B. IX. ]</note> <lb/>
            iulus, pelamis, scombrus, and colias. Some of these are both <lb/>
            gregarious, and live in pairs, for all the others pair together ; <lb/>
            and some are gregarious at particular seasons, as it has been <lb/>
            said, while they are pregnant, and others in the season of <lb/>
            depositing their ova.</p>
          <p>2. The labrax and cestreus, though most hostile, will at <lb/>
            certain seasons congregate with each other, for not only do <lb/>
            congeners congregate together, but all those which feed <lb/>
            upon the same kind of food, where it is abundant. The <lb/>
            cestreus and the conger often survive after having been de­ <lb/>
            prived of their tail up to the anus, for the cestreus is eaten <lb/>
            by the labrax, and the conger by the muræna. The stronger <lb/>
            are hostile to the weaker, for the strong fish eat the others. <lb/>
            This much concerning marine creatures.</p>

          <p>1. IT has been already observed, that the dispositions of <lb/>
            animals vary in cowardice, mildness, courage, gentleness, <lb/>
            intelligence, and folly. The disposition of sheep, as I have <lb/>
            said before, is foolish, and without sense; they are the most <lb/>
            cowardly of all animals, and steal away into desert places <lb/>
            for no purpose, and in winter often escape from their fold. <lb/>
            When overtaken by a snow-storm, they will not get away, <lb/>
            unless the shepherd drives them, but will stay behind and <lb/>
            perish, unless the shepherds carry off the males, when the <lb/>
            rest will follow.</p>
          <p>2. If a person takes any of the goats by the beard (which <lb/>
            is like hair), all the rest stand by as if infatuated, and look <lb/>
            at it. Sheep will sleep in colder places than goats, for sheep <lb/>
            are more quiet, and are ready to submit themselves to man­ <lb/>
            kind. Goats do not bear the cold so well as sheep. Shep­ <lb/>
            herds teach sheep to come together when they make a noise, <lb/>
            and if any of them is left behind and does not join the flock <lb/>
            when it thunders, it will cast its young, if pregnant; where­ <lb/>
            fore, when a noise is made, they will collect together in <lb/>
            their sheds according to their custom. (Bulls are destroyed <lb/>
            by wild beasts, if they wander away from their herd.) Sheep <lb/>
            and goats lie down to rest separately in their races, <lb/>
            and when the sun begins to descend, the shepherds say that <lb/>
            the goats do not lie down with their faces to each other, but <lb/>
            they turn their backs upon each other. <pb n="236"/>

          <p>1. Cows pasture in herds, and in companies, and if one of <lb/>
            them wanders to a distance, all the rest follow, so that the <lb/>
            herdsmen, if they do not find her, immediately examine all <lb/>
            the herds. Mares in herds, if one of them happens to die, <lb/>
            will bring up her foal among them, and the whole race of <lb/>
            horses appears to have warm natural affections, of which the <lb/>
            following is a proof: the barren mares will take away the <lb/>
            foals from their mothers, and treat them with affection, <lb/>
            though they soon die for want of milk.</p>

          <p>1. Or all wild quadrupeds, the deer appears to be one of the <lb/>
            most prudent in producing its young by the wayside (where <lb/>
            wild beasts do not come, for fear of men); as soon as the young <lb/>
            is born, the dam eats the chorion, and runs to the plant <lb/>
            called seselis, which she eats, and having so done, returns to her <lb/>
            Mid. She then leads her kid to the station, to which it may <lb/>
            learn to retreat in case of danger; this is usually a chasm <lb/>
            in a rock with a single entrance, which they say that it <lb/>
            stays and defends. When the male gets fat (which usually <lb/>
            happens in the autumn) he does not show himself, but gets <lb/>
            out of the way, for his fat makes him an easy prey. He <lb/>
            sheds his horns in difficult and scarcely accessible places, <lb/>
            from whence arises the proverb, " where the stag sheds its <lb/>
            horns," for they are afraid of being seen, as if they had lost <lb/>
            their means of defence. It is said that the left horn never <lb/>
            has been seen, for he conceals it as if it had some medicinal <lb/>
            power.</p>
          <p>2. When a year old they have no horns, but only a com­ <lb/>
            mencement, as it were a sign of what is to be ; this is short, <lb/>
            and covered with thick down. When two years old, they <lb/>
            have straight horns, like sticks, for which reason they are <lb/>
            called pattalia (from <foreign xml:lang="grc">παττάλος</foreign>, a stake). In the third year <lb/>
            their horns are divided. In the fourth year they become <lb/>
            rough. In this manner they are regularly developed till <lb/>
            they are six years old. After this age their horns are al­ <lb/>
            ways the same, so that their age cannot be distinguished by <lb/>
            them. Old stags, however, are recognised by two signs; <lb/>
            some of them have no teeth at all, others only a few; and <pb n="237"/>
            <note type="margin">B. IX.]</note> <lb/>
            they never have the defensive part of the horn, that part <lb/>
            of the growing horn which bends forwards,with which they <lb/>
            defend themselves, this the old stags never possess, but all <lb/>
            the increase of their horns is upwards.</p>
          <p>3. They cast their horns every year about the month of <lb/>
            April. When they cast their horns they hide themselves <lb/>
            during the day, as it has been already observed. They con­ <lb/>
            ceal themselves in thickets, to protect themselves from the <lb/>
            flies. During this period they feed (in the thickets) during <lb/>
            the night, until their horns are grown. They are produced <lb/>
            at first under the skin, and are covered with down. When <lb/>
            they grow they expose them to the sun, that the horn may <lb/>
            be matured and hardened. When they cease to give them <lb/>
            pain if rubbed against trees, they leave such places, for <lb/>
            they are confident in their means of defence. An Achaïnian <lb/>
            stag1 has been taken with a considerable quantity of green <lb/>
            ivy growing on its horns as in green wood, for the horns <lb/>
            are tender when first produced.</p>
          <p>4. When the stags are bitten by the phalangium or any <lb/>
            such creature, they collect together a number of crabs and <lb/>
            eat them. It appears to be wholesome for mankind to <lb/>
            drink the same substance, but it is not pleasant. The <lb/>
            females, as soon as their young are born, eat the chorium, <lb/>
            and it is not possible to obtain it, for they seize upon it <lb/>
            before it can fall to the ground; it appears to have some <lb/>
            medicinal properties. The females are captured by the <lb/>
            sound of the pipe and by singing, and they are charmed by <lb/>
            singing. When two persons go out to capture them, one <lb/>
            shows himself, and either plays upon a pipe, or sings, and <lb/>
            the other strikes behind, when the first gives him the <lb/>
            signal; when the ears of the deer are erect, it hears quickly, <lb/>
            and cannot be deceived, as it may be if they hang down.</p>

          <p>1. WHEN bears are in flight, they drive their cubs before them, <lb/>
            or take them up and carry them. When nearly overtaken, <lb/>
            they climb up into trees. When they first come from their <lb/>
            hiding place they eat the arum, as it has been already ob­ <lb/>
            served, and gnaw the trees as if they were cutting teeth. <lb/>
            Many other animals also prudently provide themselves with <note type="footnote"> 1 A bracket, or two year old stag. </note> <pb n="238"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. IX.</note> <lb/>
            remedies, for they say that the wild goats in Crete, when <lb/>
            struck with an arrow, seek out the dittany, for this plant <lb/>
            assists in working the arrow from their body.</p>
          <p>2. And dogs, when they are ill, provide themselves with <lb/>
            an emetic from a certain kind of grass. The panther, when <lb/>
            it has eaten the poison called pardalianches,l seeks for human <lb/>
            ordure, for this relieves it. This poison also will kill lions, <lb/>
            the hunters, therefore, suspend ordure in a vessel from the <lb/>
            trees, in order that the animal may not wander far from <lb/>
            them; for the panther jumps at it and attempts to seize it, <lb/>
            and dies before it can reach it. They say that the panther <lb/>
            is aware that its peculiar scent is grateful to other wild <lb/>
            animals, and that it preys upon them in concealment, and <lb/>
            when deer approach near, it catches hinds.</p>
          <p>3. The Egyptian ichneumons, when they see the serpent <lb/>
            called the asp, do not attack it until they have invited others <lb/>
            to assist. They roll themselves in mud as a protection <lb/>
            against its blows and wounds ; they first bathe in water and <lb/>
            then roll themselves on the ground. When the crocodile <lb/>
            gapes, the trochilus flies into its mouth, to cleanse its teeth ; <lb/>
            in this process the trochilus procures food, and the other per­ <lb/>
            ceives it, and does not injure it; when the crocodile wishes the <lb/>
            trochilus to leave, it moves its neck that it may not bite the <lb/>
            bird. When the tortoise has eaten a viper, it afterwards eats <lb/>
            origanum ; this has been observed. A person who had often <lb/>
            seen this done, and had observed that when the tortoise had <lb/>
            tasted the origanum it went back to the viper, gathered all <lb/>
            the origanum, and when this was done, the tortoise died.</p>
          <p>4. The weasel eats the herb rue before it attacks a <lb/>
            serpent, for the smell of this herb is obnoxious to serpents. <lb/>
            When the draco has eaten much fruit, it sucks the juice of <lb/>
            the bitter lettuce; it has been seen to do this. When dogs are <lb/>
            troubled with worms, they eat the green tops of corn. When <lb/>
            the pelargus or any other bird has been wounded in flight, <lb/>
            they feed upon marjoram, and many persons have seen the <lb/>
            locust2 settle upon the neck of serpents with which it was <lb/>
            contending. The weasel also appears prudent in the way in <lb/>
            which it attacks birds, for it kills them in the same manner <lb/>
            as wolves kill sheep ; it will fight also with serpents, and <lb/>
            especially with those that hunt mice; for the weasel pursues <lb/>
            the same animals. <note type="footnote"> 1 Perhaps Aconite. </note><note type="footnote">2 Spar lacerticida.—Schneider. </note> <pb n="239"/>

            of the hedgehog, for when the north and south winds change, <lb/>
            those that dwell in the earth alter the position of the en­ <lb/>
            trance of their burrows ; those which are kept in houses alter <lb/>
            their position from wall to wall, so that they say that in <lb/>
            Byzantium there was a person who obtained the character <lb/>
            of predicting the change of the weather, from observations <lb/>
            made on the hedgehog. The ictis is about the size of a small <lb/>
            Maltese dog; in the thickness of its hair, its appearance, <lb/>
            its white belly, and the cunning of its disposition, it re­ <lb/>
            sembles the weasel; it is easily tamed ; it attacks hives of <lb/>
            bees, for it is very fond of honey; it eats birds like cats; <lb/>
            its penis, as it has been already observed, is bony, and ap. <lb/>
            pears to be a remedy for stranguary in the human subject; <lb/>
            it is administered in shavings.</p>

          <p>]. MANY animals in their mode of life appear to imitate <lb/>
            mankind, and one may observe greater accuracy of intellect <lb/>
            in small than in large animals; as the manufacture of its <lb/>
            dwelling by the swallow is remarkable among birds; it has <lb/>
            the same method of combining chaff with mud, for it mixes <lb/>
            the mud with straw, and if mud is not to be found, it <lb/>
            dips in the water and rolls itself in the dust; it uses straw <lb/>
            in making its nest as men use it, for it places the largest <lb/>
            at the bottom, and makes it commensurate with its own <lb/>
            bulk; both the male and female labour in support of the <lb/>
            young. They feed each in turn, observing by some agree­ <lb/>
            ment the one which was first fed that none may receive food <lb/>
            twice; at first they turn the dung out of the nest, but as <lb/>
            the young birds increase in size, they teach them to turn <lb/>
            themselves, so as to eject their excrement out of the nest.</p>
          <p>2. There are some observations which may be made on <lb/>
            pigeons, for they will not pair with many mates, nor do they <lb/>
            forsake their first companion, unless they become widowed. <lb/>
            The care and anxiety of the male at the time of parturition <lb/>
            are remarkable, for if the pain causes the hen to feel languid <lb/>
            when near the nest, he beats her and drives her in. When <lb/>
            the young are hatched, the parent provides salt earth, which <lb/>
            is injected into the open mouth of the young birds, as a pre­ <lb/>
            paration for the reception of food. When it is time for <lb/>
            them to leave the nest, the male copulates with them alL <pb n="240"/>
             </p>
          <p><note type="margin">[B. IX.</note> 3. In this manner they have usually a great affection for <lb/>
            each other. Some females will copulate with males that are <lb/>
            not their own mates. This bird is contentious, they fight <lb/>
            together, and attack each other's nests, though not fre­ <lb/>
            quently, for although they are beaten when at a distance, <lb/>
            they will fight to the last when near their nests ; it appears <lb/>
            to be characteristic of the pigeon, phaps, and turtle not <lb/>
            to lean back when they drink, unless they have had sum­ <lb/>
            cient. The turtle and phatta aways remain faithful to the <lb/>
            same male, and will not permit another to approach them, <lb/>
            and the male and female share the labour of incubation. <lb/>
            The male and female are not easily distinguished, except <lb/>
            by their internal structure.</p>
          <p>4. The phatta is long-lived, they have been known to <lb/>
            live for twenty-five or thirty years, some even forty years; <lb/>
            their claws grow when they become aged, and pigeon <lb/>
            breeders cut them off, and in no other respect are they in­ <lb/>
            ferior when aged. The turtle and the pigeon, if they have <lb/>
            been blinded by those who use them as decoy birds, will live <lb/>
            eight years. The partridge lives fifteen years, the phaps and <lb/>
            the turtle always build in the same places.</p>
          <p>5. On the whole, males also live longer than females, but in <lb/>
            these birds they say that the males die before the females; <lb/>
            this conclusion is derived from the observation of those <lb/>
            which are brought up in houses for decoy birds. Some <lb/>
            persons say that cock-sparrows only live for one year, con­ <lb/>
            sidering this as a proof, that early in the spring there are no <lb/>
            birds with black beneath the chin ; but they have it after­ <lb/>
            wards, as if none of the former birds had survived. The <lb/>
            hen-sparrows have a longer life, for these are taken among <lb/>
            the young birds, and are easily known by the hard portion <lb/>
            about their bills. The turtle lives during the summer in <lb/>
            cold places, and during the winter in warm places. The finch <lb/>
            lives during the summer in warm places, and in cold places <lb/>
            during winter.</p>

          <p>1. THE heavy birds do not make nests, for it does not agree <lb/>
            with their mode of flight, as the quail, partridge, and all <lb/>
            such birds ; but when they have made a hole in the smooth <lb/>
            ground (for they never produce their young in any other <pb n="241"/>
            <note type="margin">B. IX.]</note> <lb/>
            place), they collect together some thorns and sticks for a <lb/>
            defence against the hawks and eagles, and there lay their <lb/>
            eggs and incubate. As soon as the young are hatched, they <lb/>
            lead them out, because their slow flight prevents them from <lb/>
            procuring food for them. The quail and partridge shelter <lb/>
            their young under their wings, like the domestic fowl.</p>
          <p>2. They do not lay and incubate in the same place, lest <lb/>
            any one should discover the place while they sat there for a <lb/>
            long while; and when any one in hunting falls upon the <lb/>
            nest, the partridge halts before him, as if she could be taken, <lb/>
            and draws him after her in the hopes of capture, until all <lb/>
            the young ones have had time to escape, and after she flies <lb/>
            back and recalls them to their nest. The partridge does <lb/>
            not lay less than ten eggs, and often sixteen. As it has been <lb/>
            already observed, it is a bird of an evil and cunning dispo­ <lb/>
            sition. In the spring they separate with singing and fight. <lb/>
            ing into pairs with the females which each may happen to <lb/>
            take. The partridge being a bird of violent passions, it tries <lb/>
            to prevent the female from incubation by rolling and break­ <lb/>
            ing the eggs, if it can find them. The female, opposing this <lb/>
            artifice by another, lays her eggs as she runs, and often, <lb/>
            from her desire of laying, she drops her eggs wherever <lb/>
            she may be, if the male is present; and, that they may all <lb/>
            be preserved, she does not return to them. If she is ob­ <lb/>
            served by men, she leads them away from her eggs as from <lb/>
            her young ones, and shows herself just before them until <lb/>
            they are drawn away from the nest.</p>
          <p>3. When the hen has escaped for incubation, the cocks <lb/>
            crow and fight together. These are called widowers. The <lb/>
            vanquished in the combat follows his conqueror who alone <lb/>
            has intercourse with him; and if any one is overcome by <lb/>
            a second, or by any chance one, the victor has secret inter­ <lb/>
            course with him. This does not take place always, but only at <lb/>
            certain seasons of the year. The quail does the same, and <lb/>
            domestic fowls also; for when a new one is offered in the <lb/>
            temples, where they are kept without the females, all in <lb/>
            turn are united with it. Tame partridges have sexual inter­ <lb/>
            course with wild ones, and strike and insult them.</p>
          <p>4. The leader of the wild partridges attacks the partridge <lb/>
            used in fowling, and goes out crowing as if he would fight. <lb/>
            When he is taken in the trap, the other goes out and crows <note type="footnote"> R </note> <pb n="242"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. IX.</note> <lb/>
            in the same manner. If the partridge used for fowling is a <lb/>
            cock, they behave in this way; but if it is a female, and she <lb/>
            calls, the leader answers her call; and all the rest rise UD <lb/>
            and beat him, and drive him away from the female, because <lb/>
            he attends to her instead of themselves. For this reason <lb/>
            he often comes silently, that the others may not hear his <lb/>
            voice and come out to fight him. And some experienced <lb/>
            fowlers say that the male approaches the female in silence, <lb/>
            that the other males may not hear him and compel him to <lb/>
            fight them. The partridge not only calls, but also utters a <lb/>
            shrill cry and other sounds.</p>
          <p>5. And it often happens, when the hen is sitting, that if <lb/>
            she sees the male approaching the decoy bird, she will get <lb/>
            up from her nest and remain in his way, that he may have <lb/>
            intercourse with her, and not be drawn away by the decoy <lb/>
            bird. Partridges and quails have such violent sexual desires <lb/>
            that they will fall upon the fowlers and often perch upon <lb/>
            their heads.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER X.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. THIS is the mode of the sexual intercourse of the par­ <lb/>
            tridge, and the way in which they are caught, and the nature <lb/>
            of the rest of their crafty disposition. Quails, and partridges, <lb/>
            and some other birds make their nest upon the ground, as <lb/>
            it has been already observed. Of such birds the lark, wood­ <lb/>
            cock, and quail do not perch upon trees, but upon the ground.</p>
          <p>2. The woodpecker does not settle upon the ground, but <lb/>
            it strikes trees in order to drive out the worms and flies <lb/>
            which they contain, and it picks them up with its tongue as <lb/>
            they emerge. Its tongue is wide and large. It walks upon <lb/>
            the trees in any position, even beneath the branches, like the <lb/>
            gecko. It has claws stronger than those of the colœus, which <lb/>
            provide for its safety in climbing trees; for it fixes them in <lb/>
            the bark as it walks up the trees. There is one kind of <lb/>
            woodpecker less than the blackbird, covered with small <lb/>
            red spots, and another kind larger than the blackbird, and <lb/>
            a third kind nearly as large as the domestic hen. It builds <lb/>
            its nest upon trees, as it has been already observed, both on <lb/>
            olive and other trees; and it feeds upon ants and worms <lb/>
            which live in trees. It hunts for worms so diligently that <lb/>
            they say it hollows out the trees so much as to throw them <pb n="243"/>
            <note type="margin">B. IX.]</note> <lb/>
            down. A tame bird has been known to place an almond in <lb/>
            a crack in wood, to prepare it for the stroke of its bill, and <lb/>
            break it with three blows, in order to eat the kernel.</p>

          <p>MANY prudent actions appear to be performed by cranes; <lb/>
            for they travel great distances, and fly at a great elevation, <lb/>
            in order that they may see farther; and if they see clouds <lb/>
            and wintry weather, they descend and rest themselves. <lb/>
            They have also a leader in front; and in the rear are those <lb/>
            which give a signal by whistling, so that their voice may be <lb/>
            heard. When they settle on the ground, the rest sleep with <lb/>
            their head under the wing, first on one foot, then on the <lb/>
            other; but the leader watches with his neck stretched out, <lb/>
            and when he sees anything he gives a signal by his cry. <lb/>
            The pelicans, which inhabit the rivers, swallow large smooth <lb/>
            shells with their drink, and when they have been digested <lb/>
            in the first part of their stomach, they vomit them up, in <lb/>
            order that they may pick out and eat their flesh when they <lb/>
            open their valves.</p>

          <p>1. THE habitations of wild birds are contrived with relation <lb/>
            to their mode of life and the preservation of their young. <lb/>
            Some of them are kind to their young and careful of them : <lb/>
            others are of a different disposition. Some manage well in <lb/>
            their mode of life: others do not. Some dwell in clefts, and <lb/>
            holes, and in rocks, as the birds called charadrius. This <lb/>
            bird is faulty both in its colours and its voice. It appears <lb/>
            during the night, and escapes in the day time.</p>
          <p>2. The hawk also builds in precipitous places; and al­ <lb/>
            though it is carnivorous, it does not devour the heart of the <lb/>
            bird it has killed. Some have observed this with respect to <lb/>
            the quail and thrush, and others with other birds. There is <lb/>
            also a change in their mode of hunting their prey, for they <lb/>
            do not seize them in the same way in summer and in winter. <lb/>
            It is said that no one has ever seen the young or the nest of <lb/>
            the carrion vulture. Wherefore Herodorus, the father of <lb/>
            Brison the sophist, says that they come from some distant <lb/>
            elevated land, using this proof, that many of them ap­ <lb/>
            pear suddenly, but where they come from is not intelligible <note type="footnote"> A2 </note> <pb n="244"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. IX.</note> <lb/>
            to any one. The reason is this, they make their nest in <lb/>
            inaccessible rocks, and the bird is not an inhabitant of many <lb/>
            countries. It produces one egg or two at the most.</p>
          <p>3. Some birds dwell in mountains and in woods, as the <lb/>
            hoopoe and brenthus. This bird has a good habit of life and <lb/>
            a good voice. The trochilus dwells in thickets and holes. <lb/>
            It is taken with difficulty, for it is swift in flight, and its <lb/>
            disposition is weak ; but its mode of life is good, and it is <lb/>
            artful. It is also called presbys and basileus. Wherefore <lb/>
            also they say that it fights with the eagle.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XIII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. THERE are some which live near the sea, as the cinclus. <lb/>
            In disposition this bird is cunning and difficult of capture, <lb/>
            and when taken easily tamed. It appears to be lame, for <lb/>
            its hinder parts are weak. All birds with webbed feet live <lb/>
            near the sea, or near rivers and ponds, for their nature <lb/>
            teaches them to seek what is advantageous for them. Many <lb/>
            of those with divided feet live near waters and marshes, as <lb/>
            the anthus in the neighbourhood of rivers. Its colour is <lb/>
            beautiful, and its mode of life good. The diver lives near <lb/>
            the sea, and when it plunges into the sea it remains <lb/>
            as long a time as it would take a man to walk over a pleth­ <lb/>
            rum of ground. This bird is less than a hawk.</p>
          <p>2. The swan also is web-footed, and lives in ponds and <lb/>
            marshes. Its manner of life and disposition is good, and so <lb/>
            is its mode of rearing their young and its old age. If an <lb/>
            eagle attacks the swan, it defends itself and comes off victo­ <lb/>
            rious, but will not commence the fight. Swans have the <lb/>
            power of song, especially when near the end of their life; <lb/>
            for they then fly out to sea, and some persons, sailing near <lb/>
            the coast of Libya, have met many of them in the sea sing­ <lb/>
            ing a mournful song, and have afterwards seen some of <lb/>
            them die.</p>
          <p>3. The cymindis is seldom seen, for it inhabits mountains. <lb/>
            It is black, and about the size of the hawk called pigeon <lb/>
            hawk. Its form is long and slight. (It shines with a <lb/>
            metallic lustre, wherefore also it is called chalcis.) The <lb/>
            Ionians call it cymindis: wherefore Homer writes in the <lb/>
            Iliad, "the bird which the gods call chalcis, and mortals <lb/>
            cymindis." (Some persons say that the hybris is the same <pb n="245"/>
            <note type="margin">B. IX.]</note> <lb/>
            bird as the ptynx.) This bird does not show itself in the <lb/>
            day-time because its sight is dim; but it hunts its prey <lb/>
            during the night like the eagle. It fights so fiercely with <lb/>
            the eagle that both are often taken alive by the shepherds. <lb/>
            It lays two eggs, and builds in rocks and caverns. Cranes <lb/>
            fight so fiercely with each other that these also are taken <lb/>
            alive by the shepherds while they are fighting. The crane <lb/>
            lays two eggs.</p>

          <p>1. THE jay changes its voice frequently, for it utters a <lb/>
            different one, as we may say, almost every day; it lays about <lb/>
            nine eggs; it makes its nest upon trees, of hair and wool; <lb/>
            when the acorns fall, it conceals and stores them up. Many <lb/>
            persons have reported that the stork is fed by its young, <lb/>
            and some people say the merops also, and that they are fed <lb/>
            by the young, not only in their old age, but as soon as the <lb/>
            young birds are able to do so, and that the parents remain <lb/>
            within the nest; in appearance, this bird is green beneath <lb/>
            the wings, and blue above, as the kingfisher, and its wings are <lb/>
            red at the extremity. It lays six or seven eggs in the autumn, <lb/>
            in muddy caverns, and digs as much as four cubits into the <lb/>
            ground.</p>
          <p>2. The bird called chloris from being yellow beneath, <lb/>
            is of the size of the lark, and lays four or five eggs; it <lb/>
            makes its nest of symphytum, which it pulls up by the root, <lb/>
            and lines it with straw, hair, and wool. The blackbird and <lb/>
            jay do the same, and line their nests with the same ma­ <lb/>
            terials ; the nest of the acanthyllis is also artfully con­ <lb/>
            structed, for it is folded together like a ball of flax, and has <lb/>
            a small entrance. And the natives of those places say that <lb/>
            there is a cinnamon bird, and that they bring the cinnamon <lb/>
            from the same places as the bird, and that it makes its nest <lb/>
            of it. It builds its nest in lofty trees and among their <lb/>
            branches, but the natives of the country tip their arrows <lb/>
            with lead, with which they destroy the nests, and then pick <lb/>
            out the cinnamon from the other material.</p>

          <p>1. THE halcyon is not much larger than a sparrow; its <lb/>
            colour is blue and green, and somewhat purple ; its whole <pb n="246"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. IX.</note> <lb/>
            body is composed of these colours as well as the wings and <lb/>
            neck, nor is any part without every one of these colours. <lb/>
            Its bill is somewhat yellow, long, and slight; this is its ex­ <lb/>
            ternal form. Its nest resembles the marine balls which are <lb/>
            called halosachnæ,1 except in colour, for they are red ; in form <lb/>
            it resembles those sicyae (cucumbers) which have long necks; <lb/>
            its size is that of a very large sponge, for some are greater, <lb/>
            others less. They are covered up, and have a thick solid <lb/>
            part as well as the cavity; it is not easily cut with a sharp <lb/>
            knife, but when struck or broken with the hand, it divides <lb/>
            readily like the halosachnæ. The mouth is narrow, as it <lb/>
            were a small entrance, so that the sea-water cannot enter, <lb/>
            even if the sea is rough ; its cavity is like that of the sponge ; <lb/>
            the material of which the nest is composed is disputed, but <lb/>
            it appears to be principally composed of the spines of the <lb/>
            belone, for the bird itself lives on fish. It also ascends <lb/>
            rivers ; it does not produce more than five eggs; it continues <lb/>
            to reproduce throughout the whole of its life, from the time <lb/>
            of being four months old.</p>

          <p>1. THE hoopoe generally makes its nest of human ordure. <lb/>
            It changes its appearance in summer and winter, like most <lb/>
            other wild birds. The titmouse, as they say, lays the <lb/>
            greatest number of eggs, some say that the bird called me­ <lb/>
            lancoryphus lays the greatest number of eggs after the Libyan <lb/>
            sparrow, seventeen have been observed, but it will produce <lb/>
            more than twenty, and, as they say, it always lays a great <lb/>
            many. This bird also builds in trees, and lives upon worms. <lb/>
            It is characteristic of this bird and the nightingale not to <lb/>
            have any tip to their tongue. The ægithus has a good mode <lb/>
            of life, and is careful of its young, but is lame upon its feet. <lb/>
            The chlorion is a clever and diligent bird, but its flight is <lb/>
            difficult, and its colours bad.</p>
          <p>2. The elea, like some other birds, has an excellent mode <lb/>
            of life, and dwells during the summer in groves and in the <lb/>
            shade, and during the winter in sunshine, perching upon the <lb/>
            reeds on the sides of marshes. It is a small bird, with a <lb/>
            good voice.</p>
          <p>8. The bird called gnaphalus has a sweet voice, its colours <note type="footnote">1 Probably a Zoophyte, Alcyonia. </note> <pb n="247"/>
            <note type="margin">B. IX.]</note> <lb/>
            are beautiful, its mode of life good, and its form elegant; <lb/>
            it appears to be a foreign bird, for it is rarely found in <lb/>
            places where there are no houses.</p>
          <p>4. The disposition of the crex is pugnacious, but it is in­ <lb/>
            genious in providing for its own subsistence, though other­ <lb/>
            wise an unfortunate bird. The sitta is pugnacious, but its <lb/>
            disposition is gentle and tractable, and its mode of life good. <lb/>
            It .is said to be medicinal, for it is skilful in many things. <lb/>
            It produces many young, which it treats with kindness, and <lb/>
            obtains its food by striking trees.</p>
          <p>5. The little owl feeds during the night, and is rarely visible <lb/>
            by day. It lives in rocks and caverns, for its food is of two <lb/>
            kinds ; and in disposition it is diligent and ingenious. There <lb/>
            is a small bird called certhius, which is bold in disposition, <lb/>
            and lives on trees and eats the thrips (timber worm). In <lb/>
            disposition it is diligent in search of food, and its voice is <lb/>
            brilliant. The disposition and hue of the acanthis is bad, <lb/>
            but it has a shrill voice.</p>

          <p>1. AMONG the herons, as it was before observed, the black <lb/>
            heron copulates with difficulty, but it is an ingenious bird. <lb/>
            It carries its food about, and is skilful in procuring it. It <lb/>
            works during the day. Its colour, however, is bad, and its <lb/>
            stomach always fluid. Of the other two (for there are three <lb/>
            kinds of them), the white heron is beautifully coloured and <lb/>
            copulates without pain, and builds its nest and attends its <lb/>
            young carefully in trees. It inhabits marshes and lakes, <lb/>
            plains and meadows. The bittern, which is called ocnus <lb/>
            (the idle), is said in fables to have been originally a slave. <lb/>
            Its name indicates its very idle disposition.</p>
          <p>2. The herons live in this manner. The bird called poyx <lb/>
            is peculiar, for it is its disposition to eat the eyes of other <lb/>
            creatures, and is therefore the enemy of the harpa, which <lb/>
            lives upon the same food.</p>

          <p>1. THERE are two kinds of cottyphus. The one is black, <lb/>
            and is found everywhere; the other is white. In size they <lb/>
            are alike, and their voice is very similar. The white one is <lb/>
            found in Cyllene, in Arcadia, and nowhere else. The læus <pb n="248"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. IX.</note> <lb/>
            is similar to the black cottyphus, but is rather smaller. It <lb/>
            makes its house upon rocks and tiles. It has not a dark <lb/>
            beak, like the blackbird.</p>
          <p>2. Of thrushes there are three forms. The one is called <lb/>
            misselthrush, for it lives upon nothing but miseltoe and resin. <lb/>
            It is as large as the citta; the other is called fieldfare. The <lb/>
            voice of this bird is shrill; its size is that of the blackbird. <lb/>
            There is another kind, which some persons call illas, which <lb/>
            is smaller than the others and less variegated.</p>
          <p>3. There is a certain bird living on rocks, which is called <lb/>
            blue thrush. This bird generally inhabits Scyrus. It lives <lb/>
            upon the wing. It is less than the blackbird, but larger than <lb/>
            the finch. Its feet are black, and it climbs up upon rocks. <lb/>
            It is entirely blue. It has a smooth, long beak, but its legs <lb/>
            are short, and resemble those of the woodpecker.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XIX.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. THE oriole is entirely of a yellowish green. This bird <lb/>
            is not visible in the winter. It is seen in the greatest num­ <lb/>
            bers at the summer solstice, and takes its departure when <lb/>
            Arcturus rises. It is of the same size as the turtle. The <lb/>
            malacocraneus always perches upon the same place, and is <lb/>
            captured there. This is its appearance: its head is large, <lb/>
            and has the form of cartilage; its size is smaller than the <lb/>
            thrush; its beak is strong, small, and round; its colour is <lb/>
            entirely cinereous; its feet are strong, and its wings weak; <lb/>
            it is generally captured by the owl.</p>
          <p>2. There is another bird, called the pardalus, which is <lb/>
            generally gregarious, and a single bird is never seen. Its <lb/>
            colour is entirely cinereous. In size it resembles those <lb/>
            already mentioned. Its feet are strong, and its wings are <lb/>
            not weak. Its voice is frequent and not deep. The colly­ <lb/>
            rion lives on the same food as the blackbird, and in size <lb/>
            much resembles those just named. It is generally taken in <lb/>
            the winter. These birds are visible all the year round, and <lb/>
            so are those which live in the neighbourhood of towns, the <lb/>
            raven and crow; for these are always visible, and neither <lb/>
            migrate nor conceal themselves.</p>
          <p>3. Of the jackdaw there are three kinds, one called cora­ <lb/>
            cias, which is as large as the crow, and has a red beak; <lb/>
            another is called lycius; there is also a small one called <pb n="249"/>
            <note type="margin">B. IX.]</note> <lb/>
            bomolochus; there is also another kind of jackdaw in Lydia <lb/>
            and Phrygia which is web-footed.</p>
          <p>4. Of the lark there are two kinds. One dwells on <lb/>
            the ground, and has a crest. The other is gregarious, and <lb/>
            not solitary. Its colour is similar, though it is a smaller <lb/>
            bird, and has no crest. It is used for food.</p>
          <p>5. The ascalopas is generally taken in enclosed gardens. <lb/>
            It is of the size of the domestic fowl, it has a long beak, <lb/>
            and in colour resembles the attagen. It runs quickly, and <lb/>
            is very partial to the neighbourhood of mankind. The <lb/>
            starling is variegated, and is of the size of the blackbird.</p>
          <p>6. There are two kinds of ibis in Egypt; the white and <lb/>
            the black. The white live in all the rest of Egypt, but <lb/>
            are not found in Pelusium. The black occur in Pelusium, <lb/>
            but not in other parts of Egypt.</p>
          <p>7. One kind of scops, called brown owl, is seen throughout <lb/>
            the year, but it is not eaten, for it is not fit for food. Others <lb/>
            occur sometimes in the autumn, when they appear for one, <lb/>
            or not more than two days. They are eatable, and are <lb/>
            highly esteemed. They differ in no respect from the brown <lb/>
            owl, except in fatness; and they are silent, whereas the <lb/>
            other has a voice. No observations have ever been made <lb/>
            on their mode of generation, except that they appear when <lb/>
            the west wind blows. This is manifest.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>1. THE cuckoo, as it has been already observed, makes no <lb/>
            nest, but lays its eggs in the nests of other birds, especially <lb/>
            in that of the phaps, and in those of the sparrow and <lb/>
            lark on the ground, and in the nest of the chloris in <lb/>
            trees. It lays one egg, upon which it does not sit, but <lb/>
            the bird in whose nest it lays both hatches the egg and <lb/>
            nurses the young bird; and, as they say, when the young <lb/>
            cuckoo grows, it ejects the other young birds, which thus <lb/>
            perish.</p>
          <p>2. Others say that the mother bird kills them, and feeds <lb/>
            the young cuckoo with them ; for the beauty of the young <lb/>
            cuckoo makes her despise her own offspring. People assert <lb/>
            that they have been eye-witnesses of most of these circum­ <lb/>
            stances, but all are not equally agreed as to the mode in <lb/>
            which the other young birds perish. Some persons say <pb n="250"/>
             <note type="margin">[B.IX.</note> <lb/>
            that the old cuckoo comes and devours the young of the <lb/>
            other bird. Others say that the great size of the young <lb/>
            cuckoo enables it to seize upon the food which is brought <lb/>
            to the nest, so that tke rest perish from starvation. Others <lb/>
            say that the cuckoo, being the stronger bird, kills those that <lb/>
            are brought up with it.</p>
          <p>3. The cuckoo appears to act prudently in thus depositing <lb/>
            her egg; for it is conscious of its own timidity, and that <lb/>
            it cannot defend its young, and therefore places them under <lb/>
            the protection of another bird, in order that they may be pre­ <lb/>
            served ; for this bird is very cowardly, and when it is pecked <lb/>
            by even small birds, it flies away from them.</p>

            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XXI.</title>

          <p>1. THAT the swift, which some persons call cypsellus, resem­ <lb/>
            bles the swallow, has been already observed, and it is not <lb/>
            easy to distinguish them apart, except that the legs of the <lb/>
            apos are covered with feathers. These birds rear their young <lb/>
            in small nests made of mud, which have a passage sufficient <lb/>
            for their admission. The nest is constructed in a narrow <lb/>
            place under rocks and caverns, so that it avoids both beasts <lb/>
            and men.</p>
          <p>2. The goatsucker, as it is called, is a mountain bird, <lb/>
            larger than the blackbird, and less than the cuckoo. It lays <lb/>
            two, or not more than three eggs, and is slothful in its dis­ <lb/>
            position. It flies against the goats and sucks them, whence <lb/>
            its name (aegothelas, the goat-sucker). They say that when <lb/>
            the udder has been sucked that it gives no more milk, and <lb/>
            that the goat becomes blind. This bird is not quick sighted <lb/>
            by day, but sees well at night.</p>
          <p>3. The ravens in small districts, and where they have not <lb/>
            food enough, are found only in pairs ; and as soon as their <lb/>
            young birds are able to fly, the old birds first of all turn them <lb/>
            out of the nest, and then drive them from the place. The <lb/>
            raven lays four or five eggs. When the hired soldiers of <lb/>
            Medias perished in Pharsalus, Athens and the Peloponnesus <lb/>
            were deserted by the ravens, as if they had some means of <lb/>
            communication with each other.</p>

            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XXII.</title>

          <p>1. THERE are several kinds of eagles. One which is called <lb/>
            pygargus (hen-harrier), which is found in plains and groves. <pb n="251"/>
            <note type="margin">B. IX.]</note> <lb/>
            and in the vicinity of towns. Some persona call it nebro­ <lb/>
            phonus. It is a courageous bird, and flies to mountains, and <lb/>
            woods also. The other kinds rarely appear in plains and <lb/>
            groves. There is another kind of eagle called plangus, the <lb/>
            second in point of size and strength, which lives among <lb/>
            thickets, and valleys, and marshes. It is called nettophonus <lb/>
            and morphnus. Of this kind Homer speaks at the departure <lb/>
            of Priam.</p>
          <p>2. There is another kind, which is black. It is smaller, <lb/>
            and stronger than the others. It inhabits mountains and <lb/>
            woods. It is called melanæetus, and lagophonus. This is <lb/>
            the only one that rears and educates its young. It is swift, <lb/>
            elegant, liberal, fearless, warlike, and of a good omen, for it <lb/>
            neither cries nor screams. There is another kind with spotted <lb/>
            wings. It has a white head, and is the largest of all eagles. <lb/>
            Its wings are short, and its rump very long, like the vulture; <lb/>
            it is called oreipelargus, and hypæetus. It inhabits groves. <lb/>
            It has all the faults of the rest, and none of their good <lb/>
            qualities; for it is taken and pursued by ravens and other <lb/>
            birds. It is a heavy bird, and its mode of life is bad. It <lb/>
            carries about dead creatures; it is always hungry, and <lb/>
            screams and cries.</p>
          <p>3. There is another kind of eagle called sea eagle, which <lb/>
            has a long and thick neck, curved wings, and a wide rump. <lb/>
            It inhabits the sea and the coast. When they have seized <lb/>
            their prey, and cannot carry it away, they are borne down <lb/>
            into the sea. There is, again, another kind of eagle, called <lb/>
            true eagle. They say that these alone of all other birds are <lb/>
            true, for the other kinds are mixed and crossed with each <lb/>
            other, both eagles, hawks, and other smaller kinds. This <lb/>
            is the largest of all the eagles, greater than the phene ; one <lb/>
            and a half times as large as other eagles, and of a red colour: <lb/>
            it is seldom seen, like that called cymindis.</p>
          <p>4. The time for the activity of the eagle, and for its flight, <lb/>
            is from dinner till the evening, for it sits aloft till the time <lb/>
            when the market-place begins to fill. When eagles grow old, <lb/>
            their beaks become more and more curved, so that at last they <lb/>
            die of famine. The story goes, that the eagle was once a man, <lb/>
            and suffers this as a punishment for inhospitality to a guest. <lb/>
            Any superabundant food is put aside for their young in their <lb/>
            nests, for it is not easy for them to procure it every day, and <lb/>
            sometimes they have no place from whence to bring it. <pb n="252"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin">[B. IX.</note> 5. If they find anyone attempting to take their nest, they <lb/>
            beat them with their wings, and tear them with their claws. <lb/>
            They do not make their nests in plains, but in high places, <lb/>
            especially in precipitous rocks, but never on trees. They <lb/>
            rear their young till they can fly, and then turn them out of <lb/>
            their nests, and drive them to a great distance; for one pair <lb/>
            of eagles occupies a wide space of country, so that they will <lb/>
            suffer no others to live near them.</p>
          <p>6. They do not hunt their prey near their nests, but at a <lb/>
            considerable distance; and when they have hunted and <lb/>
            taken anything, they lay it down and do not take it away at <lb/>
            once, but carry it away when they have tried its weight. <lb/>
            They do not capture hares at once, but let them escape to <lb/>
            the plain. They do not descend to the plain at once, but <lb/>
            with large though gradually decreasing circles. They <lb/>
            do this in order that they may not be ensnared. They <lb/>
            settle upon eminences, because they cannot rise easily from <lb/>
            the ground. They fly aloft, that they may see the greater <lb/>
            extent of country. For this cause men say that the eagle <lb/>
            is the only divine bird.</p>
          <p>7. All birds with crooked claws avoid sitting upon rocks, <lb/>
            for its hardness is injurious to their claws. The eagle hunts <lb/>
            fawns, hares, and other animals which it is able to conquer. <lb/>
            It is a long-lived bird. This is plain from the long con­ <lb/>
            tinuance of their nests in the sarpn place.</p>
          <p>8. In Scythia there is a kind of bird as large as a bustard, <lb/>
            which produces two young ones. It does not sit upon its <lb/>
            eggs, but hides them in the skin of a hare or fox. It watches <lb/>
            them from a neighbouring tree all the while it is not en­ <lb/>
            gaged in hunting its prey. And if anyone approaches them, <lb/>
            it fights and strikes with its wings, like the eagle.</p>

          <p>1. THE owl and nycticorax, and the other birds which see <lb/>
            imperfectly by daylight, procure their food by hunting in <lb/>
            the night. They do not this all the night, but in twilight <lb/>
            and at early dawn. They hunt mice, and lizards, and <lb/>
            beetles, and such other small animals.</p>
          <p>2. The bird called asprey produces many young, is of <lb/>
            a good habit of body, diligent in search of food, and gentle ; <lb/>
            and feeds both its own young and those of the eagle: for <pb n="253"/>
            <note type="margin">B. IX]</note> <lb/>
            when the eagle turns out its young, the phene takes them <lb/>
            up and feeds them; for the eagle ejects them before the <lb/>
            proper time, when they still require feeding, and are unable <lb/>
            to fly. The eagle appears to eject its young from the nest <lb/>
            from envy ; for it is an envious and hungry bird, and not quick <lb/>
            in seizing its prey. It captures large creatures when it can. <lb/>
            When its young have grown, it envies them, for they are <lb/>
            good for food, and tears them with its claws. The young <lb/>
            also fight in the nest for particular places, and for the food. <lb/>
            The parent then turns them out of the nest and strikes <lb/>
            them. When they are turned out they begin to scream, <lb/>
            and the phene comes and takes them up. The phene is <lb/>
            dim-sighted, and its eyes are imperfect.</p>
          <p>3. The sea-eagle is very quick-sighted, and compels its <lb/>
            young to gaze on the sun before they are feathered. If any <lb/>
            one of them refuse, it is beaten and turned round: and the <lb/>
            one of them which first weeps when gazing on the sun is <lb/>
            killed, the other is reared. It lives near the sea side, and ob­ <lb/>
            tains its food by pursuing marine birds, as it was before <lb/>
            remarked. It pursues and takes them one at a time, watching <lb/>
            them as they emerge from the sea. And if the bird, as it <lb/>
            rises, sees the eagle watching it, it dives again from fear, in <lb/>
            order that it may rise again in another place: but the eagle's <lb/>
            quick sight enables him to pursue the bird till it is either <lb/>
            suffocated, or taken on the wing; but it never attacks them <lb/>
            in any numbers, for they drive it away by sprinkling it with <lb/>
            their wings.</p>
          <p>4. The petrels are taken with foam, for they devour it. <lb/>
            They are therefore taken by sprinkling them. All the rest <lb/>
            of its flesh is good; the rump alone smells of seaweed, and <lb/>
            they are fat.</p>

          <p>1. THE buzzard is the strongest of the hawks; next to this <lb/>
            the merlin. The circus is less strong; the asterias and <lb/>
            phassophonus, and pternis are different. The wide-winged <lb/>
            hawks are called hypotriorches, others are called perci and <lb/>
            spiziae; others are the eleii and the phrynolochi; these birds <lb/>
            live very easily, and By near the ground.</p>
          <p>2. Some persons say that there are no less than ten kinds <lb/>
            of hawks ; they differ from each other, for some of them <pb n="254"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. IX</note> <lb/>
            kill the pigeon as it perches on the ground, and carry it <lb/>
            away, but do not touch it in flight ; others attack it as it <lb/>
            sits upon the trees, or in some such situation, but will not <lb/>
            touch it when upon the ground or in flight; other kinds of <lb/>
            hawks will not strike the bird when perching upon the <lb/>
            ground or anywhere else, but will endeavour to attack it <lb/>
            when in flight.</p>
          <p>3. They say that the pigeons can distinguish each of these <lb/>
            kinds, so that if they see one of those which attack them in <lb/>
            the air flying towards them, they remain sitting where <lb/>
            they are, but if it is one of those which strike them on the <lb/>
            ground, they do not remain still, but fly away.</p>
          <p>4. In the city of Thrace, formerly called Cedropolis, <lb/>
            men are assisted by hawks in pursuing birds in the <lb/>
            marshes. They strike the reeds and wood with sticks <lb/>
            in order that the birds may fly up, and the hawks ap­ <lb/>
            pearing above pursue them, the birds then fall to the <lb/>
            earth through fear, when the men strike them with their <lb/>
            sticks and take them, and divide the prey with the hawks, <lb/>
            for they throw away some of the birds, and the hawks <lb/>
            come and take them.</p>
          <p>5. On the Palus Mœotis, they say that wolves are <lb/>
            accustomed to assist the fishermen in their calling, and if <lb/>
            they do not give them their share of the food, they destroy <lb/>
            the nets that are laid to dry on the ground. This, then, is <lb/>
            the nature of birds.</p>

            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XXV.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. MARINE animals also have many artful ways of pro­ <lb/>
            curing their food, for the stories that are told of the batra­ <lb/>
            chus, which is called the fisher, are true, and so are those of <lb/>
            the narce. For the batrachus has appendages above its <lb/>
            eyes, of the length of a hair, with a round extremity to <lb/>
            each like a bait; it buries itself in the sand or mud, and <lb/>
            raises these appendages above the surface, and when the <lb/>
            small fish strike them, it draws them down, till it brings <lb/>
            the fish within reach of its mouth.</p>
          <p>2. The narce stupefies any fish it may wish to master, <lb/>
            with the peculiar force which it has in its body, and then <lb/>
            takes and feeds upon them; it lies concealed in sand and <pb n="255"/>
            <note type="margin">B. IX.]</note> <lb/>
            mud, and captures as they swim over it any fish that it can <lb/>
            take and stupefy; of this circumstance many persons have <lb/>
            been witnesses ; the trygon also hides itself, but not in the <lb/>
            same manner; the following is a proof of their mode of <lb/>
            life, for they are often taken with the cestreus in their <lb/>
            stomach, which is the swiftest of fishes, and they are the <lb/>
            slowest; and the batrachus, when nothing is left on the <lb/>
            hair-like appendages, is taken in an emaciated condition. <lb/>
            The narce also has plainly caused stupefaction in men.</p>
          <p>3. The onus, batus, psetta, and rhine also bury themselves <lb/>
            in the sand, and when they have hidden themselves, the ap­ <lb/>
            pendage which is in their mouth stands up, this the <lb/>
            fishermen call their staff, and the small fish approach it <lb/>
            as if it was the sea-weed, on which they usually live. <lb/>
            Wherever the anthias is found there are no obnoxious crea­ <lb/>
            tures ; when this sign is observed, those who collect sponges <lb/>
            dive for them there, and call the anthias the sacred fish; <lb/>
            this is only a coincidence, just as the pig and partridge <lb/>
            are never found where there are snails, for they eat them <lb/>
            all.</p>
          <p>4. The marine-serpent, in colour and in the form of its <lb/>
            body, resembles the conger, but it is darker, and more power­ <lb/>
            ful. If it is captured and allowed to escape, it buries itself <lb/>
            in the sand, which it pierces with its snout, for its snout <lb/>
            is sharper than that of a serpent. The creature called <lb/>
            scolopendra when it has swallowed the hook turns itself <lb/>
            inside out, till the hook is ejected, when it turns to its <lb/>
            original form. The scolopendra, like that which inhabits <lb/>
            the land, is attracted by the smell of cooked meat; it does <lb/>
            not bite with the mouth, but stings with the contact of <lb/>
            the whole body, like the creatures called sea-nettles.</p>
          <p>5. The fish called alopex, when one of them has swal­ <lb/>
            lowed the hook, assist each other in this matter, as the <lb/>
            scolopendra also does, for they collect together round <lb/>
            the line and bite it off; in some places, where the water is <lb/>
            swift and deep, they are taken with many hooks in them. <lb/>
            The amiæ also collect together when they see any obnoxious <lb/>
            creature near them, and the largest swim round them in <lb/>
            a circle; when attacked, they defend themselves; they <lb/>
            have strong teeth, and the lamia and other creatures when <lb/>
            attacking them have been seen to be repulsed with wounds <pb n="256"/>
             </p>
          <p><note type="margin">[B. IX.</note> 6. Among river fish the male glanis is very careful of <lb/>
            his young fry, but the female goes away as soon as she has <lb/>
            deposited her ova, but the male continues to watch by the <lb/>
            greater number of the ova, paying them no more attention <lb/>
            than to drive away other fish, that they may not carry away <lb/>
            the ova; he is thus employed for forty or fifty days; <lb/>
            until the young fry are so far grown that they can es­ <lb/>
            cape from other fish ; the fishermen know when it is guarding <lb/>
            its ova, for it drives away other fish, and as it jumps at them <lb/>
            it makes a noise and a murmur. It remains with such af­ <lb/>
            fection beside its ova, that if they are -deposited in deep <lb/>
            water, and the fishermen attempt to bring them into <lb/>
            shallow water, the fish will not forsake them; but if <lb/>
            young it is easily taken with a hook, from its habit of seizing <lb/>
            upon any fish that may come in its way; but if it is ex­ <lb/>
            perienced, and has swallowed a hook before, it does not <lb/>
            leave its ova, but with its hard teeth it will bite and destroy <lb/>
            the hook.</p>
          <p>7. All creatures with fins, and stationary animals, inhabit <lb/>
            either the places in which they were born, or similar lo­ <lb/>
            calities, for their peculiar food is found in such places. The <lb/>
            carnivorous fish are the greatest wanderers ; all are carni­ <lb/>
            vorous with a few exceptions, as -the cestreus, salpa, trigla, <lb/>
            and chalcis. The mucous substance which the pholis emits <lb/>
            forms around it, and resembles a chamber. Of the apo­ <lb/>
            dal testacea, the pecten is the most locomotive, for it flies <lb/>
            by means of its own valves; the purpura and its congeners <lb/>
            advance very slowly.</p>
          <p>8. All the fish except the cobius leave the Pyrrhic Euripus <lb/>
            during the winter on account of the cold, for the Euripus is <lb/>
            colder than the sea, and return again in the spring. In the <lb/>
            Euripus the scarus, the thrissa, all the thorny fish, the galus, <lb/>
            acanthia, carabus, polypus, bolitæna, and some others are <lb/>
            wanting, and of those that are produced in the Euripus, the <lb/>
            white cobius is not an inhabitant of the sea. Those fish <lb/>
            which have ova are in the highest season in the spring, <lb/>
            before they produce their ova ; those that are viviparous in <lb/>
            the autumn, and besides these the cestreus, trigla, and their <lb/>
            congeners. In the neighbourhood of Lesbos, both the ma­ <lb/>
            rine fish and those of the Euripus produce their ova in <lb/>
            the Euripus; they copulate in the autumn, and deposit <pb n="257"/>
            <note type="margin">B. IX.]</note> <lb/>
            their ova in the spring. The males and females of the se­ <lb/>
            lachea also mix together, in numbers, in the autumn, for the <lb/>
            purpose of copulation ; but in the spring they separate <lb/>
            until they have produced their young; at the period of <lb/>
            sexual intercourse, they are often taken united together.</p>
          <p>9. The sepia is the most cunning of the malacia, and is <lb/>
            the only one which uses its ink for the purpose of conceal­ <lb/>
            ment, when it is not alarmed. The polypus and teuthis <lb/>
            emit their ink only when alarmed. These creatures never <lb/>
            emit all their ink, and as soon as it is emitted it is secreted <lb/>
            again. But the sepia, as it has already been remarked, <lb/>
            makes use of its ink for the purposes of concealment, and <lb/>
            when it pretends to advance, it returns into its ink. With <lb/>
            its long extended tentacula it not only pursues small fish, <lb/>
            but frequently attacks the cestreus. The polypus is a foolish <lb/>
            creature, for it will approach a man's hand if brought near <lb/>
            it. It is an economical animal, for it collects all its prey in <lb/>
            the hole in which it dwells, and when the most useful part <lb/>
            has been consumed, it ejects the shells, the coverings of <lb/>
            the cancri, and conchylia, and the spines of the fish, it pur­ <lb/>
            sues any fish that may come in its way, changing its colour <lb/>
            and imitating that of any neighbouring stone. It does the <lb/>
            same thing when alarmed.</p>
          <p>10. Some persons say that the sepia has power to do the <lb/>
            same thing, and that it can imitate the colour- of the place <lb/>
            it inhabits. The rhine is the only fish endowed with the <lb/>
            same power, for it can change its colours like the poly­ <lb/>
            pus. The polypus rarely lives for two years, for it is by <lb/>
            nature subject to decay. This is a proof of it, that when <lb/>
            pressed, this animal always emits something, until at last it <lb/>
            consumes away. The females suffer so much from this in <lb/>
            the period of parturition, as to become foolish, and not per­ <lb/>
            ceive any agitation of the waves, so that they are easily <lb/>
            taken by the hand of the diver; they become like mucus, <lb/>
            and are not able to pursue their prey.</p>
          <p>11. The males become hard and shining. This appears to <lb/>
            be a proof that they do not survive a year, that in the <lb/>
            summer and autumn, after the production of the young, <lb/>
            it is difficult to find a large polypus, though large ones <lb/>
            were abundant a short time before ; when they have pro­ <lb/>
            duced their ova, they say that both sexes grow old and be­ <note type="footnote">a </note> <pb n="258"/>
            <note type="margin">[ B. IX.</note> <lb/>
            come so weak, that they are devoured by small fish, and <lb/>
            are easily dragged out of their holes, though before they <lb/>
            would have permitted nothing of the kind. They also say <lb/>
            that the small and young ones will not endure this, and that <lb/>
            they are stronger than the large ones. The sepia also only <lb/>
            lives one year; the polypus is the only one of the malacia <lb/>
            that ever ventures upon dry land, it advances upon a rough <lb/>
            surface, but avoids smooth places. In other respects, it is <lb/>
            a strong animal, but its neck, if pressed, becomes very weak.</p>
          <p>12. This is the nature of the malacia. They say that <lb/>
            .... form their rough shells round themselves like a hard <lb/>
            breastplate, which increases as they grow, and that they <lb/>
            can leave these, as if they were a hole or a habitation. <lb/>
            The nautilus is a polypus peculiar both in its nature and its <lb/>
            actions; for it sails upon the surface of the sea, rising <lb/>
            up from the depths of the waters. It is brought to the <lb/>
            surface with its shell inverted, in order that it may go out <lb/>
            more easily and navigate in an empty shell. When it <lb/>
            reaches the surface, it turns its shell over. There is a <lb/>
            membrane extended between two of its tentacula similar <lb/>
            to the web feet of birds, except that theirs is thick and that <lb/>
            of the nautilus thin and like a spider's web. This it uses <lb/>
            for a sail when the wind blows, and it extends two of its <lb/>
            tentacula for rudders. If alarmed, it fills its shell and sinks <lb/>
            in the sea. No one has made any accurate observation on the <lb/>
            production and growth of the shell. It appears not to ori­ <lb/>
            ginate in sexual intercourse, but to be produced like that of <lb/>
            other conchylia, nor is it clear whether it can live when <lb/>
            taken out of its shell.</p>

          <p>1. THE most laborious of all insects, if compared with the <lb/>
            rest, are the tribes of ants and bees, with the hornets, wasps, <lb/>
            and their other congeners. Some of the spiders are more <lb/>
            neat, graceful, and skilful than others in their mode of life. <lb/>
            Every one may see the diligence of the ant; for it is on the <lb/>
            surface, and that they always travel in one direction, and <lb/>
            make a store and treasure-house of food, for they work even <lb/>
            in the night when there is a full moon.</p>
          <p>2. There are many kinds of spiders and phalangia. Of <lb/>
            the phalangia that bite there are two sorts. The one re- <pb n="259"/>
            <note type="margin">B. IX. ]</note> <lb/>
            sembles those called wolves. It is small, variegated, sharp, <lb/>
            and active in jumping. It is called psylla. The other is <lb/>
            larger. Its colour is black, and its fore-legs are long. Its <lb/>
            movements are slow, and it can scarcely walk. It is not <lb/>
            strong, nor capable of jumping. The other kinds, which the <lb/>
            dealers in medicine offer for sale, either do not bite at all, or <lb/>
            very slightly.</p>
          <p>3. There is another kind of those called wolves. One <lb/>
            is small, and makes no web, and the larger sort makes a <lb/>
            coarse inferior web upon the ground or in hedges. It always <lb/>
            makes its web over chinks in the soil, and with the origin of <lb/>
            the web in the interior it keeps guard until something falls <lb/>
            into the web and moves it, when it comes out. The va­ <lb/>
            riegated kind makes a small inferior web among trees.</p>
          <p>4. There is another third kind, which is very skilful and <lb/>
            graceful. It commences the process of weaving by extend­ <lb/>
            ing its web to the extremities on all sides, and then it draws <lb/>
            a thread from the centre, and takes up the centre cor­ <lb/>
            rectly. Upon these threads it weaves, as it were, the woof, <lb/>
            and then weaves them altogether. Its sleeping place and <lb/>
            store-room are situated at a distance. In seeking its prey <lb/>
            it watches in the middle of its web. When anything <lb/>
            falls into the web and the centre is moved, the spider sur­ <lb/>
            rounds and encloses it in a web, until it is rendered power­ <lb/>
            less, and then takes it up and carries it to her store. If <lb/>
            hungry, she sucks it, for this is their method of enjoyment; <lb/>
            and if not hungry, hastens back for the pursuit of more <lb/>
            prey, and in the first place mends her broken web.</p>
          <p>5. If anything in the meanwhile has fallen into the web, <lb/>
            she first goes to the centre, and from that point, as before, <lb/>
            falls upon her victim. If anyone destroys the web, she <lb/>
            begins spinning again at the rising or setting of the sun, for <lb/>
            it is at this time that her prey usually falls into the web. <lb/>
            The female both makes the web and pursues the prey. The <lb/>
            male only enjoys it with her.</p>
          <p>6. There are two kinds of graceful spiders that spin a <lb/>
            thick web, one large and one small. The one with long legs <lb/>
            keeps watch suspended above its web, that the creatures <lb/>
            which fall into the web may not be frightened when taken, <lb/>
            and then it falls upon them from above, for its size prevents <note type="footnote">s 2 </note> <pb n="260"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. IX </note> <lb/>
            it from being easily concealed. But the smaller kind con­ <lb/>
            ceals itself in a small superior chamber of the web.</p>
          <p>7. Spiders have the power of emitting their web as soon <lb/>
            as they are born, not from within their bodies, as if it were <lb/>
            an excrement, as Democritus says, but from the surface of <lb/>
            their body, like the bark of a tree, or like the ejected spines <lb/>
            of some animals, as the porcupine. They will attack and <lb/>
            surround with their web animals larger than themselves; for <lb/>
            they will attack small lizards, and beginning at the mouth, <lb/>
            will emit the web until their mouth is covered, and then will <lb/>
            approach and bite them. This is the nature of these animals.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>1. THERE is a tribe of insects which has not yet received <lb/>
            any name, although in form all the species resemble each <lb/>
            other. This tribe includes those that form wax, as the bee <lb/>
            and those which resemble it in shape. Of these there are <lb/>
            nine sorts, six of which are gregarious, the bee, the king bee, <lb/>
            the drone, which dwells among the bees, the annual wasp, <lb/>
            the hornet, and tenthredo. These are solitary, the small <lb/>
            siren, of a tawny colour, and another siren, which is large, <lb/>
            black, and variegated. The third, which is larger than these, <lb/>
            is called bombylius. The ants pursue no prey, but only col­ <lb/>
            lect that which is already found. The spiders do not make <lb/>
            anything, nor lay up a store, but only hunt down their prey,</p>
          <p>2. Of the rest of the nine kinds already mentioned we <lb/>
            will treat hereafter. The bees do not hunt for prey, but <lb/>
            they both produce and lay up stores. The honey is their <lb/>
            food. This is plainly shown when the honey dealers attempt <lb/>
            to take the combs. When they are fumigated and suffer­ <lb/>
            ing from the effects of the smoke, they devour the honey <lb/>
            greedily, which they are not observed to do at other times; <lb/>
            but they spare it and store it up for food. They have also <lb/>
            another kind of food, which is called cerinthus (bee bread), <lb/>
            which is of an inferior quality, and sweet like figs. They <lb/>
            carry this upon their legs as they do the wax.</p>
          <p>3. There is great variety in their diligence and mode of <lb/>
            life. For when a clean hive is given them, they build their <lb/>
            combs, bringing the drops from flowers and trees, such as <lb/>
            the willow, the elm, and other glutinous trees. With this <lb/>
            also they smear the floor of their hive, for fear of other crea- <pb n="261"/>
            <note type="margin">B. IX.]</note> <lb/>
            tures. The honey dealers calls this substance commosis, <lb/>
            and they build up the entrance of their hive if it is too wide. <lb/>
            They first build cells for their own habitation, then those for <lb/>
            the kings and the drones. They always build cells for them­ <lb/>
            selves, and royal cells when there are many young ; but they <lb/>
            only build cells for the drones when there is plenty of honey.</p>
          <p>4. They make the royal cells near their own. These are <lb/>
            small. Those for the drones are placed next. These are of <lb/>
            a smaller size than those of the bees. They commence the <lb/>
            formation of their combs from the top of the hives, and carry <lb/>
            them down until several reach the floor of the hive. The cells, <lb/>
            whether for the honey or the grubs, are constructed with two <lb/>
            mouths; for there are two cells built on each base, like a double <lb/>
            cup, one on the inside, the other on the outside. The cells at <lb/>
            the beginning of the comb, near the hives, are joined toge­ <lb/>
            ther for as much as two or three rows in a circle, and are <lb/>
            short, and contain no honey. The cells which are formed <lb/>
            with the greatest quantity of wax contain the most honey.</p>
          <p>5. They spread the substance called mitys at the en­ <lb/>
            trance of their hives, near the opening. This material is <lb/>
            black, as if it was the purification of the wax, and of a <lb/>
            harsh smell. It is considered a remedy for contusions <lb/>
            and suppurations. Next to this the pissocerus is smeared <lb/>
            over the floor of the hive. This substance is less useful <lb/>
            than the mitys in the healing art. Some persons say that <lb/>
            the drones build cells for themselves, dividing both the hive <lb/>
            and the wax with the bees; but they make no honey, but both <lb/>
            themselves and their young are supported by that of the bees. <lb/>
            The drones generally remain in the hives; and if they fly out <lb/>
            they rise in the air with a great noise, wheeling about as if <lb/>
            they were exercising; and when they have done this they <lb/>
            return to the hive and feast themselves on the honey.</p>
          <p>6. The king bees never leave the hives, either for food or <lb/>
            any other purpose, except with the whole swarm ; and they <lb/>
            say that, if a swarm wanders to a distance, they will. retrace <lb/>
            their steps and return until they find the king by his pecu­ <lb/>
            liar scent. They say also that, when the king is unable to <lb/>
            fly, he is carried by the swarm; and if he perishes, the whole <lb/>
            swarm dies with him. And if they continue for a time <lb/>
            to form cells, they place no honey in them, and then they <lb/>
            also perish. <pb n="262"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin">[B. IX</note> 7. The bees collect the wax by climbing actively on the <lb/>
            flowers with their fore feet. They cleanse these upon the <lb/>
            middle pair of legs, and their middle legs again on the <lb/>
            curved part of their hind legs, and thus loaded they By <lb/>
            away. They are evidently heavily loaded. During each <lb/>
            flight the bee does not settle upon flowers of different kinds, <lb/>
            but as it were from violet to violet, and touches no other <lb/>
            species till it returns to the hive. There they are unloaded, <lb/>
            and two or three bees follow every one on its return to the <lb/>
            hive. It is not easy to see what is taken, nor has their <lb/>
            manner of working it been ever observed Their manner of <lb/>
            collecting wax upon the olive trees has been the subject of <lb/>
            observation; for the thickness of the leaves makes them <lb/>
            remain a long while in this tree.</p>
          <p>8. After having done this they produce their young. <lb/>
            There is nothing to prevent there being grubs, and honey, <lb/>
            and drones in the same comb. As long as the king bee is <lb/>
            alive, they say that the drones are produced in a separate <lb/>
            place; but when he is dead they are produced by the bees <lb/>
            in their own cells, and such drones are more passionate : for <lb/>
            this cause they are called stingers, not that they have any <lb/>
            sting, but that they would sting, if they had the power to <lb/>
            do so. The drone cells are larger. Sometimes the drone <lb/>
            cells are placed by themselves, but are generally combined <lb/>
            with those of bees, for which reason they cut them off.</p>
          <p>9. There are several kinds of bees, as has been already <lb/>
            observed: two kinds of kings, the better sort of which is <lb/>
            red, and the other sort is black and variegated, and in size <lb/>
            double that of a good bee. The best kind is small, round, <lb/>
            and variegated ; the other is long, like the wild bee. There <lb/>
            is another called phor (the thief) ; it is black, and has a <lb/>
            broad abdomen. The drone is another sort: it is the largest <lb/>
            of them all, has no sting, and is stupid. The bees that are <lb/>
            produced from those that inhabit cultivated places are dif. <lb/>
            ferent from the natives of mountainous countries, for those <lb/>
            produced from wood bees are more hairy, smaller, less, more <lb/>
            diligent, and more violent. The best bees elaborate a smooth <lb/>
            comb, with a polished surface. The comb also is of one <lb/>
            form, as if entirely adapted for honey, or for grubs, or <lb/>
            drones ; and if it happens that all these are produced in the <lb/>
            same comb, each form will be elaborated in order. <pb n="263"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin">B. IX.]</note> 10. The long bees make their combs uneven, and the <lb/>
            covering swollen, like that of the wild bee. Their offspring, <lb/>
            also, and the rest of their productions, are not arranged in <lb/>
            any order, but according to chance. Among them there <lb/>
            are many bad kings, and many drones, and thieves, as they <lb/>
            are called; but little or no honey. The bees sit upon the <lb/>
            combs, in order to bring them to maturity. If this is not <lb/>
            done, they say that the cells perish and become filled with <lb/>
            a web ; but if afterwards they are able to continue sitting, <lb/>
            something like an abortion is produced : if they cannot sit, <lb/>
            the whole perishes. Maggots are formed in those cells that <lb/>
            perish, which acquire wings and fly away. If a comb falls <lb/>
            down, the bees set it up, and put props beneath it, in order <lb/>
            that they may be able to pass underneath ; for if they have no <lb/>
            path by which to approach the place where they sit, the cells <lb/>
            become covered with a web.</p>
          <p>11. The thieves and the drones do not work, but only in. <lb/>
            jure the other bees, and when taken they are killed by the <lb/>
            useful bees. Many of their rulers are also frequently killed, <lb/>
            and especially the bad ones, in order that the swarm may <lb/>
            not be dispersed by their numbers. They are the more dis­ <lb/>
            posed to kill them when the swarm is not fruitful, and no <lb/>
            casts are formed. At such times they destroy the royal <lb/>
            cells, if any have been prepared, for they are the leaders of <lb/>
            the swarm. They destroy also those of the drones, if honey <lb/>
            is scarce, or the swarm is short of honey. They fight boldly <lb/>
            for their honey with those that would take it from them, <lb/>
            and drive out any drones that may be in the hive, and are <lb/>
            often seen sitting upon the hives.</p>
          <p>12. The small bees fight eagerly with the long kind, and <lb/>
            endeavour to drive them from their hives: and if they pre­ <lb/>
            vail, it seems to be a sign of a very strong swarm; but if the <lb/>
            others conquer, when left alone, they are idle, and do nothing <lb/>
            that comes to good, but perish in the course of the autumn. <lb/>
            Whenever the useful bees kill any of them, they endeavour <lb/>
            to do so outside of the hive; and if any of them die in the <lb/>
            hive, they carry them out. Those which are called thieves <lb/>
            injure their own combs, and if they can do it in secret, <lb/>
            they will enter those of other bees, but if discovered they <lb/>
            are killed. It is, however, difficult to enter unperceived, <lb/>
            for there are guards placed at each entrance; and if one con- <pb n="264"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. IX.</note> <lb/>
            trives to enter unnoticed, he is unable to fly from repletion, <lb/>
            and is rolled out before the whole swarm; so that it is diffi. <lb/>
            cult to escape.</p>
          <p>13. The kings themselves are never seen out of the hives, <lb/>
            except with a young swarm, and in young swarms all the <lb/>
            rest appear to be collected round him. When a swarm <lb/>
            is about to separate, a peculiar and singular noise is made <lb/>
            for some days, and for two or three days beforehand a few <lb/>
            bees are seen flying round the hive; and if the king is <lb/>
            among them he is not seen, for it is not easy to see him. And <lb/>
            when they are collected, all the rest fly away and separate <lb/>
            themselves with their respective kings : and if a few of them <lb/>
            happen to be near at hand, they join themselves with one of <lb/>
            the numerous swarms. And if the king that they have left <lb/>
            follows them, they kill him. This is the manner of their <lb/>
            leaving the hive, and of swarming.</p>
          <p>14. They all have their proper work to perform. Some <lb/>
            bring flowers, others water, and others polish and erect the <lb/>
            cells. Water is brought when they are rearing their young. <lb/>
            None of them ever settle upon flesh, nor will they eat any­ <lb/>
            thing seasoned. They have no particular time for com­ <lb/>
            mencing work, but when they are properly supplied, and <lb/>
            in good health, they are particularly diligent during the <lb/>
            summer. When the day is fine they work without ceasing, <lb/>
            and as soon as the young bees are three days old, they set <lb/>
            to work, if properly fed. And when the swarm settles <lb/>
            some depart for food, and afterwards return. In healthy <lb/>
            swarms the progeny of the bees only cease from reproduction1 <lb/>
            for about forty days after the winter solstice. As soon as <lb/>
            the young bees are grown, they offer them food, and smear <lb/>
            the cells with it, and as soon as they are strong enough, the <lb/>
            young bees rupture the covering of the cell, and so escape.</p>
          <p>15. The good kinds of bees destroy any creatures that are <lb/>
            produced in their hives and destroy the combs; but the other <lb/>
            kinds from their inferiority overlook the destruction of their <lb/>
            work. When the dealers in honey take the combs, they <lb/>
            leave the bees some food for the winter. If sufficient is left, <lb/>
            the swarm is preserved; but if not, they either die in the <lb/>
            winter, or, if the weather continues fine, desert the hive. <note type="footnote">1 This should probably be read " the bees only cease from their work <lb/>
            for forty days during the winter solstice.” </note> <pb n="265"/>
             <note type="margin">B. IX.]</note> <lb/>
            They eat honey both in summer and in winter. They also <lb/>
            lay up another kind of food, which is as hard as wax, which <lb/>
            some persons call sandarache.</p>
          <p>16. Wasps are very injurious to them, and so is the bird <lb/>
            called titmouse, and the swallow, and merops. The frogs <lb/>
            also in marshes destroy them when they come for water, for <lb/>
            which reason bee-fanciers destroy the frogs in those marshes <lb/>
            where the bees come for water. They also destroy wasps' <lb/>
            nests, and the nest of the swallow and merops, if near the <lb/>
            swarms of bees. They avoid no animal, except those of <lb/>
            their own kind. They fight among themselves, and with <lb/>
            the wasps. When at a distance from their hives they will <lb/>
            neither injure each other, nor any other creature; but when <lb/>
            near at home they will destroy everything that they can <lb/>
            conquer.</p>
          <p>17. When they have stung anything they perish, for they <lb/>
            cannot withdraw their sting from the wound without tear. <lb/>
            ing their own entrails; but they are frequently saved, if the <lb/>
            person stung will take care to press the sting from the <lb/>
            wound: but when its sting is lost, the bee must perish. <lb/>
            They will kill even large animals with their stings, and a <lb/>
            horse has been known to perish, if attacked by bees. The <lb/>
            rulers are the least cruel and stinging.</p>
          <p>18. If any bees die in the hive, they carry them out; and <lb/>
            in other respects the bee is a very clean creature. For this <lb/>
            reason they also eject their excrement when in flight, for <lb/>
            the smell is bad. It has been already observed that they <lb/>
            dislike bad smells and the scent of unguents, and that they <lb/>
            sting persons who use such things. They also die from <lb/>
            other causes, as when the rulers in the hive are in great <lb/>
            numbers, and each leads out a portion of the swarm. The <lb/>
            toad also destroys bees, for it blows into the entrance of <lb/>
            the hive, and watches for and destroys them as they fly out. <lb/>
            The bees cannot inflict any injury upon it, but their keepers <lb/>
            destroy it.</p>
          <p>19. Some bee-keepers say that the kind of bee which <lb/>
            makes an inferior and rough comb is the young of the others, <lb/>
            and that it is the result of imperfect skill. They are young <lb/>
            when a year old; young bees do not sting so severely as old <lb/>
            bees; for this reason the swarms are carried to the apiaries, <lb/>
            for they are those of young bees. When honey is short <pb n="266"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. IX</note> <lb/>
            they eject the drones, and put figs and other sweet things near <lb/>
            them. The elder bees work in the hives, and become hairy <lb/>
            from remaining within. The younger ones go out in the fields, <lb/>
            and are smoother: and they kill the drones when they have no <lb/>
            longer any room for them, for they are placed in a recess of <lb/>
            the hive. When a swarm has been weak, strange bees have <lb/>
            been known to come and fight with them, and take away their <lb/>
            honey ; and when the bee-keeper killed them the others came <lb/>
            out and defended themselves, and would not injure the man.</p>
          <p>20. Other diseases, and especially one called clerus, fre­ <lb/>
            quently attack strong swarms. In this disease small worms <lb/>
            are produced on the floor of the hive, and as these increase, <lb/>
            the whole swarm is held, as it were, in a spider's web, and <lb/>
            the combs decay. There is another disease, which is like a <lb/>
            wildness in the bees, and causes a strong smell in the hives. <lb/>
            The bees should be fed on thyme, the white sort is better than <lb/>
            the red. In close weather they should have a cool place, <lb/>
            and a warm one in the winter. They suffer the most when <lb/>
            they work with materials affected with the rust.</p>
          <p>21. When the wind is high, they carry a stone with them <lb/>
            for a balance. If a river is at hand they never drink any­ <lb/>
            where else, first of all laying down their weight. If no <lb/>
            river is near, they drink in some other place, and then <lb/>
            vomit up their honey, and again set to work. There are <lb/>
            two seasons for making honey, the spring and autumn. <lb/>
            That formed in the spring is sweeter, whiter, and, on <lb/>
            the whole, better than that formed in autumn. The <lb/>
            best honey is made from the new wax and young flowers. <lb/>
            The red honey is inferior, on account of the wax ; for, like <lb/>
            wine, it is injured by the vessel which contains it; this <lb/>
            honey therefore should be dried up. When the thyme is <lb/>
            in flower, and the comb is full of honey, it does not become <lb/>
            inspissated. The gold-coloured honey is also good. The <lb/>
            white honey is not formed of pure thyme, but is good for the <lb/>
            eyes, and for wounds. Weak honey always floats on the sur­ <lb/>
            face, and ought to be separated. The pure honey is beneath.</p>
          <p>22. When the woods are in flower the bees form wax; at <lb/>
            this season, therefore, the wax ought to be taken from the <lb/>
            hive, for they immediately make more. These are the plants <lb/>
            from which they collect it, atractyllis, melilot, asphodel, <lb/>
            myrtle, phleos, agnus, broom. When they can procure <pb n="267"/>
             <note type="margin">B. IX.]</note> <lb/>
            thyme, they mix water with it before they smear the cells. <lb/>
            All the bees emit their excrements either on the wing, as it <lb/>
            has been said before, or into a single cell. The small bees, <lb/>
            it has been already remarked, are more industrious than the <lb/>
            large ones, so that their wings become worn at the edges, <lb/>
            and their colour black and burnt, but the bright and shiny <lb/>
            bees are idle, like women.</p>
          <p>23. Bees also appear to have pleasure in noises, so that <lb/>
            they say that they collect them into their hives by striking <lb/>
            earthen vessels and making noises. But it is very doubtful <lb/>
            whether they hear or not, and if they hear, whether they <lb/>
            collect together from pleasure or from fear. The bees drive <lb/>
            out all that are idle or wasteful. They divide the work, as <lb/>
            it has been already said ; some work at the honey, others at <lb/>
            the grubs, and others at the bee bread; some, again, form the <lb/>
            comb, others carry water to the cells, and mix it with the <lb/>
            honey, while others go to work. Early in the morning they <lb/>
            are silent, until one bee arouses them by humming two or <lb/>
            three times, when they all fly to their work; when they <lb/>
            return again there is some disturbance at first, which gradu­ <lb/>
            ally becomes less, until one of them flies round with a <lb/>
            humming noise, as if warning them to sleep, when on a <lb/>
            sudden they all become silent.</p>
          <p>24. It is a sign that the swarm is strong when there is <lb/>
            much noise and movement, as they leave and return to the <lb/>
            hive, for they are then busy with the grubs. They are most <lb/>
            hungry when they begin to work after winter. They are <lb/>
            more idle if the person who takes the honey leaves much be­ <lb/>
            hind, but it is necessary that a quantity should be left pro­ <lb/>
            portionable to the strength of the swarm, for they work less <lb/>
            actively if too little is left; they become more idle if the <lb/>
            hive is large, for they despair of their labour. The hive is <lb/>
            deprived of a measure or a measure and a half of honey; if <lb/>
            it is strong, two or two measures and a half. Some few will <lb/>
            afford three measures.</p>
          <p>25. Sheep and wasps, as it was said above, are hostile to <lb/>
            bees. The bee fanciers, therefore, catch the wasps in pans, in <lb/>
            which they place pieces of flesh; when many have fallen in, <lb/>
            they put on a lid and put them in the fire. It is good <lb/>
            for the bees to have a few drones among them, for it makes <lb/>
            them more* industrious. Bees discern the approach of cold. <pb n="268"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. IX.</note> <lb/>
            weather and of rain; this is plain, for they will not leave <lb/>
            the hive, but even if the day is fine are occupied in the hive. <lb/>
            By this the bee keepers know that they expect severe <lb/>
            weather.</p>
          <p>26. When they are suspended upon each other in the hive, <lb/>
            it is a sign that the swarm is about to leave ; and when the bee <lb/>
            keepers see this, they sprinkle them with sweet wine. They <lb/>
            usually plant about the hive the achras, beans, poa medica, <lb/>
            syria, ochrus, myrtle, poppy, herypllus, almond. Some <lb/>
            bee keepers recognize their own bees in the fields by sprink­ <lb/>
            ling them with flour. When the spring is late or dry, and <lb/>
            when rust is about, the bees are less diligent about their <lb/>
            young. This, then, is the nature of bees.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>1. THERE are two kinds of wasps, of which the wild sort are <lb/>
            rare ; they are found in mountains, and do not build their <lb/>
            nest in the ground, but on oak trees ; in form they are larger, <lb/>
            longer, and darker than the other sort; they are variegated, <lb/>
            all of them have stings, and are strong, and their sting is <lb/>
            more painful than that of the other sorts, for their sting is <lb/>
            larger in proportion to their size. These live for two <lb/>
            years, and in winter are observed to fly out of trees, when <lb/>
            they are cut down; during winter they live in holes. Their <lb/>
            place of concealment is in trees; some of them are mother <lb/>
            wasps, and some workers, as in those which are more do­ <lb/>
            mestic ; the nature of the workers and the mother wasps <lb/>
            will be explained when we come to speak of the more <lb/>
            domestic kind.</p>
          <p>2. For there are two kinds of the domestic wasps, <lb/>
            the rulers, which they call mother wasps, and the <lb/>
            workers; the rulers are larger and more gentle, and the <lb/>
            workers do not survive the year, but all of them die, on the <lb/>
            arrival of winter. This is plain, for at the beginning of <lb/>
            winter the workers become stupid, and about the solstice <lb/>
            are seen no more; but the rulers, which are called mother <lb/>
            wasps, are seen during the whole of the winter, and bury <lb/>
            themselves in the earth; for in ploughing and digging <lb/>
            during the winter, the mother wasps have been frequently <lb/>
            observed, but no one has ever seen a worker.</p>
          <p>3. The following is the manner of their reproduction: <pb n="269"/>
            <note type="margin">B. IX.]</note> <lb/>
            when the rulers have found a place properly situated, at <lb/>
            the beginning of summer, they form their combs and build <lb/>
            the wasps nests, as they are called; these are small, with four <lb/>
            holes, or thereabouts ; in these working wasps are produced, <lb/>
            and not mother wasps. When these are grown, they after­ <lb/>
            wards build larger nests, and again larger still, as the <lb/>
            swarm increases, so at the end of autumn the nests are very <lb/>
            numerous and large, and in these the mother wasps no <lb/>
            longer produce workers but mothers. These larger maggots <lb/>
            are produced on the top of the upper part of the nest, in <lb/>
            four or rather more adjoining cells, very like those of the <lb/>
            rulers in their combs. When the working wasps are pro­ <lb/>
            duced in the combs, the rulers no longer labour, but the <lb/>
            workers bring them food ; this is evident, from the rulers <lb/>
            never flying away from the workers, but remaining quietly <lb/>
            within.</p>
          <p>4. Whether the rulers of the previous year, when they <lb/>
            have produced new rulers, die at the same time as the young <lb/>
            wasps, or whether they survive a longer period, no one has <lb/>
            ever observed, nor has anyone ever observed the old age of <lb/>
            the mother wasps, or of the wild wasps, or any other of their <lb/>
            affections. The mother wasp is broad and heavy, and thicker, <lb/>
            and larger than the working wasp, and her weight prevents <lb/>
            her from being very active in flight, neither can she fly far, <lb/>
            but always sits in the wasps' nests, and fashions and arranges <lb/>
            the internal parts.</p>
          <p>5. There are generally mother wasps in the nests, but <lb/>
            there is some doubt whether they have stings or not; they <lb/>
            seem, however, like the rulers among the bees, to have <lb/>
            stings, though they never put them out nor sting; some <lb/>
            wasps, like the drones, are without stings, others have a sting. <lb/>
            Those that are without stings are smaller, and not so angry, <lb/>
            neither do they defend themselves; those which are fur­ <lb/>
            nished with a sting are larger, and strong ; some call these <lb/>
            the males, and those which have no sting the females. To­ <lb/>
            wards winter many of those that have stings appear to lose <lb/>
            them, though we have never met with eye-witnesses of this <lb/>
            circumstance.</p>
          <p>6. Wasps are more abundant in dry seasons and rough <lb/>
            places ; they are produced beneath the earth, they make their <lb/>
            combs of collected materials and of earth, each springing <pb n="270"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. IX</note> <lb/>
            from one origin, as if from a root. They procure their food <lb/>
            from some flowers and fruits, but generally, they are car­ <lb/>
            nivorous. Some persons have observed them in the act of <lb/>
            sexual intercourse, but whether one or both had stings or <lb/>
            not, was not seen. Some wild wasps also have been seen in <lb/>
            the act of intercourse, one of them had a sting, whether the <lb/>
            other had was not observed. Their offspring does not seem <lb/>
            to be produced from this intercourse, but is always larger <lb/>
            than the offspring of the wasp should be.</p>
          <p>7. If a person takes hold of the legs of a wasp, and per­ <lb/>
            mits it to buzz with its wings, those that have no stings will <lb/>
            fly towards him, which those with stings will not do, and <lb/>
            some persons consider this to be a sign that the one are males, <lb/>
            the other females. Some are taken in caverns during the <lb/>
            winter with stings, and others without them. Some of them <lb/>
            make small nests and few in number; others make many <lb/>
            large nests. Many of those called mother wasps are taken <lb/>
            at the turn of the season in the neighbourhood of elms, for <lb/>
            they collect the sticky and glutinous matter. There are a <lb/>
            great many mother wasps, when wasps have been abundant <lb/>
            during the previous year, and the weather rainy. They are <lb/>
            captured in the neighbourhood of precipitous places and <lb/>
            straight fissures in the earth, and all appear to have stings. <lb/>
            This, then, is the nature of wasps.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XXIX.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. THE wild bees do not live by gathering honey from flowers <lb/>
            like the bees, but are entirely carnivorous, for which reason <lb/>
            they frequent the neighbourhood of dung ; for they pursue <lb/>
            large flies, and when they have taken them they tear off the <lb/>
            head and fly away, carrying the rest of the body with them. <lb/>
            They will also eat sweet fruit. This, then, is the nature of <lb/>
            their food. They have rulers, like the bees and wasps ; and <lb/>
            in proportion to the size of the wild bee these rulers are <lb/>
            larger than those of the bees and wasps. Their rulers also <lb/>
            keep in the nest, like those of the wasps.</p>
          <p>2. The wild bees make their nest under the soil, which they <lb/>
            remove like the ants. They never swarm like bees, neither <lb/>
            do wasps; but the young ones always remain with them, and <lb/>
            as the nest increases they carry out the heap of earth. The <lb/>
            nests become large; and from a flourishing nest three or <pb n="271"/>
            <note type="margin">B. IX.]</note> <lb/>
            four baskets of comb have been taken. They do not lay up <lb/>
            any food like bees, but conceal themselves during the winter. <lb/>
            The greater number of them die, but it is not known whe­ <lb/>
            ther all of them perish. There is never more than one ruler <lb/>
            in the nest as in the swarm of bees, or they would divide <lb/>
            the nest.</p>
          <p>3. When some of the wild bees wander from the nest, they <lb/>
            turn aside to some material and form another nest, such as <lb/>
            are often seen on the surface of the soil, and in this they <lb/>
            work themselves out a ruler; and when he is grown he goes <lb/>
            out and leads them with him to take possession of a nest, in <lb/>
            which they may dwell. No one has ever made any observa­ <lb/>
            tion on the mode of sexual intercourse in the wild bee, nor on <lb/>
            the origin of their offspring. Among bees the drones and <lb/>
            kings have no stings, and some of the wasps also are without <lb/>
            stings, as it has been remarked already; but all the wild bees <lb/>
            appear to have stings, but more accurate inquiry should be <lb/>
            instituted as to the rulers, whether they have stings or not.</p>

          <p>THE humble bees produce their young under stones on the <lb/>
            surface of the ground in two or a few more cells. The com­ <lb/>
            mencement of a kind of inferior honey is found in them. The <lb/>
            tenthredo is like the wild bee, but it is variegated, and as <lb/>
            broad as the bee. It is a dainty creature, and the only <lb/>
            one which resorts to kitchens, and enjoys fish and such like <lb/>
            things. It deposits its young under the earth like the <lb/>
            wasps. It is a very productive creature, and its nest is <lb/>
            much larger and longer than that of the wasp. This is the <lb/>
            nature of the work and economy of bees, wasps, and their <lb/>
            congeners.</p>

          <p>1. IT has been already observed that we can distinguish a <lb/>
            difference in the dispositions of animals, especially in the <lb/>
            courage and cowardice, and then in their mildness and fierce­ <lb/>
            ness, even in wild animals. The lion in his manner of feed­ <lb/>
            ing is very cruel; but when he is not hungry, and is full fed, <lb/>
            his disposition is gentle. He is not either jealous or suspi­ <lb/>
            cious. He is fond of playing with and affectionate towards <lb/>
            those animals which have been brought up with him, and to <pb n="272"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. IX</note> <lb/>
            which he has become accustomed. When hunted, he has <lb/>
            never been seen to retreat or be alarmed; and if compelled <lb/>
            to yield to the numbers of his hunters, he retreats slowly <lb/>
            and leisurely, and turns himself round at short inter­ <lb/>
            vals. If overtaken in a thicket, he flies rapidly till he <lb/>
            reaches the open plain, and then again he withdraws slowly. <lb/>
            If compelled by numbers to retreat openly on the plain <lb/>
            ground, he runs at full stretch, and does not leap. His <lb/>
            manner of running is continuous, like that of a dog at full <lb/>
            stretch. When pursuing his prey, he throws himself upon <lb/>
            it when he comes within reach.</p>
          <p>2. It is, however, true, as they say, that the lion is afraid <lb/>
            of the fire, as Homer also writes, " The burning faggots <lb/>
            which he fears when urged against him and that he ob­ <lb/>
            serves the person who strikes him and attacks him; and if <lb/>
            a person aims a blow at him without hitting him, the lion, if <lb/>
            he can rush upon and seize him, does not do him any injury, <lb/>
            nor tear him with his claws, but shakes and frightens him, <lb/>
            and then leaves him. They are more disposed to enter <lb/>
            towns and attack mankind when they grow old; for old age <lb/>
            renders them unable to hunt, from the disease which attacks <lb/>
            their teeth. They live many years; and a lame lion has <lb/>
            been captured which had many of its teeth broken, which <lb/>
            some persons considered as a sign that it had lived many <lb/>
            years. For this could not have happened except by the <lb/>
            lapse of time.</p>
          <p>3. There are two kinds of lions. One of these has a round <lb/>
            body and more curly hair, and is a more cowardly animal. <lb/>
            The other is of a longer form, has straight hair, and is more <lb/>
            courageous. Sometimes, when retreating, they stretch out <lb/>
            their tails like dogs; and a lion has been at times observed, <lb/>
            when about to attack a hog, to retreat when that animal <lb/>
            erected its bristles. The lion is weak if struck in the belly, <lb/>
            but will bear many blows on other parts of the body, and <lb/>
            its head is very strong. If they bite or -tear anything, <lb/>
            a large quantity of yellow serum flows from the wound, <lb/>
            which can never be stopped by bandages or sponges. The <lb/>
            mode of healing is the same as in the bite of a dog.</p>
          <p>4. The jackal is an animal attached to mankind. It does <lb/>
            not injure men, nor is it much afraid of them, but it will <lb/>
            fight with the dog and the lion. They are not, therefore, <pb n="273"/>
            <note type="margin">B. IX.]</note> <lb/>
            found in the same locality. The small jackal is the best. <lb/>
            Some persons say that there are two, others that there are <lb/>
            three sorts; but, like some fish, birds, and quadrupeds, the <lb/>
            jackal changes at differer t seasons, and has a different colour <lb/>
            in summer and in winter. In summer it is smooth; in win­ <lb/>
            ter, rough.</p>

          <p>1. THE bonassus is found in Pæonia, in Mount Messapius, <lb/>
            which forms the boundary between Pæonia and Mædia. <lb/>
            The Pæonians call it monapus. It is as large as a bull, and <lb/>
            more heavily built; for it is not a long animal, and its skin, <lb/>
            when stretched out, will cover a couch for seven persons to <lb/>
            recline upon. In form it resembles a bull, but it has a <lb/>
            mane as far as the point of the shoulder like the horse, but <lb/>
            its hair is softer than that of the horse, and shorter. The <lb/>
            colour of its hair is red. The hair is deep and thick as far <lb/>
            down as the eyes, and in colour between ash-coloured and <lb/>
            red, not like that of roan horses, but darker. Its hair below <lb/>
            is like wool. They are never either very black or very red.</p>
          <p>2. Their voice is like that of the ox. Their horns are <lb/>
            crooked and bent together, of no use for defence, a span long <lb/>
            or a little more, so thick that each of them would hold half <lb/>
            a measure or a little more. The black part of their horn is <lb/>
            good and smooth. The fore lock is so placed between the <lb/>
            eyes that the creature can look sideways better than for­ <lb/>
            wards. Like the ox, it has no upper teeth in front, neither <lb/>
            have any horned animals. Its legs are rough and its hoofs <lb/>
            cloven. Its tail is small in proportion to its size, like that of <lb/>
            the ox, and it tears up the ground and digs with its hoof <lb/>
            like the bull. The skin upon its sides is strong. Its flesh <lb/>
            is excellent food, and for this it is hunted.</p>
          <p>3. When wounded it retreats, and stays when it can pro­ <lb/>
            ceed no farther. It defends itself by kicking and ejecting <lb/>
            its dung, which it can do to the distance of four fathoms <lb/>
            from itself. It uses this means of defence easily and fre­ <lb/>
            quently. Its dung is so caustic as to burn the hair from <lb/>
            dogs. The dung is only caustic when the creature is dis­ <lb/>
            turbed and alarmed. It is not so when undisturbed. This <lb/>
            is the form and nature of this creature. At the season of <lb/>
            parturition they collect together in numbers in the moun­ <note type="footnote"> T </note> <pb n="274"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. IX.</note> <lb/>
            tains, and make a circle of their dung round the place, as it <lb/>
            were a fortification, for this animal ejects a large quantity <lb/>
            of this excrement.</p>

          <p>OF all wild animals the elephant is the most tame and <lb/>
            gentle; for many of them are capable of instruction and <lb/>
            intelligence, and they have been taught to worship the king. <lb/>
            It is a very sensitive creature, and abounding in intellect. <lb/>
            The male never again touches a female that he has once <lb/>
            impregnated. Some persons say that the elephant will live <lb/>
            for two hundred years, others an hundred and twenty, and <lb/>
            the female lives nearly as long as the male. They arrive at <lb/>
            perfection when sixty years old. They bear winter and cold <lb/>
            weather very badly. It is an animal that lives in the neigh­ <lb/>
            bourhood of rivers, though not in them. It can also walk <lb/>
            through rivers, and will advance as long as it can keep its <lb/>
            proboscis above the surface; for it blows and breathes <lb/>
            through this organ, but it cannot swim on account of the <lb/>
            weight of its body.</p>

          <p>CAMELS refuse to have sexual intercourse with their dams, <lb/>
            even when forced; for once a camel driver, who was in <lb/>
            want of a male camel, veiled the dam and introduced her <lb/>
            young to her. When the covering fell off in the act of <lb/>
            copulation, he finished what he was about, and soon after­ <lb/>
            wards bit the camel driver to death. It is said also that the <lb/>
            king of Scythia had an excellent mare, which always pro­ <lb/>
            duced good colts. He wished to have a colt out of the mare <lb/>
            by the best of these horses, and introduced him for copula­ <lb/>
            tion, but he would not do it. When she was covered up, <lb/>
            however, he performed the act unwittingly. As soon as the <lb/>
            form of the mare was shown after copulation, and the horse <lb/>
            saw what was done, he ran away and threw himself down a <lb/>
            precipice.</p>

          <p>1. AMONG marine animals there are many instances re­ <lb/>
            ported of the mild, gentle disposition of the dolphin, and of <lb/>
            its love of its children, and its affection, in the neighbourhood <pb n="275"/>
            <note type="margin">P. IX.]</note> <lb/>
            of Tarentum, Caria, and other places. It is said that when <lb/>
            a dolphin was captured and wounded on the coast of Caria, <lb/>
            so great a number came up to the harbour, that the fishermen <lb/>
            let him go, when they all went away together. And one <lb/>
            large dolphin, it is said, always follows the young ones, to <lb/>
            take care of them ; and sometimes a herd of large and small <lb/>
            dolphins has been seen together, and two of these having left <lb/>
            appeared soon after, supporting and carrying on their back <lb/>
            a small dead dolphin, that was ready to sink, as if in pity <lb/>
            for it, that it might not be devoured by any other wild <lb/>
            creature.</p>
          <p>2. Some incredible things are also told of their swiftness, <lb/>
            for it appears to be the swiftest of all animals, whether <lb/>
            marine or terrestrial. They will leap over the sails of large <lb/>
            ships. This is especially the case when they pursue a fish <lb/>
            for the sake of food; for their hunger will make them pur­ <lb/>
            sue their prey into the depths of the sea, if it retreats to <lb/>
            the bottom. And when they have to return from a great <lb/>
            depth, they hold their breath, as if they were reckoning <lb/>
            the distance, and then they gather themselves up, and <lb/>
            dart forward like an arrow, desirous of shortening their <lb/>
            distance from a breathing-place. And if they meet with <lb/>
            a ship they will throw themselves over its sails. Divers <lb/>
            also do the same thing when they have sunk themselves <lb/>
            into deep water, for they also gather up their strength <lb/>
            in order to rise to the surface. The males and females live <lb/>
            in pairs with each other. There is some doubt as to the <lb/>
            reason why they cast themselves on the land, for they <lb/>
            say that sometimes they appear to do this without any <lb/>
            cause.</p>

          <p>1. As the actions of all animals agree with their dispositions, <lb/>
            so also their dispositions will change with their actions, and <lb/>
            some of their parts also. This takes place among birds ; for <lb/>
            hens, when they have conquered the cock, desire to copu­ <lb/>
            late with others, and their crest and rump become elevated, <lb/>
            so that it is difficult to say whether they are hens or not. <lb/>
            In some, also, small spurs are found; and some males, after <lb/>
            the death of the female, have been seen to take the same care <lb/>
            of the young as the female would have done, leading them <note type="footnote"> T 2 </note> <pb n="276"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. IX.</note> <lb/>
            about and feeding them, and neither crowing, nor desiring <lb/>
            sexual intercourse. And some male birds have been seen to <lb/>
            be so effeminate from their birth, that they neither crowed, <lb/>
            nor desired sexual intercourse, and would submit themselves <lb/>
            to any males that desired them.</p>
          <p>3. Many birds at particular seasons change both their <lb/>
            colour and their voice, as the blackbird, which becomes <lb/>
            russet instead of black, and assumes another voice, for it <lb/>
            sings in the summer time, but in winter it chatters and <lb/>
            screams violently. The thrush also alters its colour, for in <lb/>
            winter it is grey, and in summer is variegated on the neck; <lb/>
            but its voice does not alter. The nightingale sings unceas­ <lb/>
            ingly for fifteen days and nights, when the mountains <lb/>
            become thick with leaves. As the summer advances it <lb/>
            utters another voice, not quick and varied, but simple; its <lb/>
            colour also is altered, and in Italy it is called by another <lb/>
            name at this season of the year. It only shews itself for a <lb/>
            short time, for it lies concealed.</p>
          <p>3. The erithacus, and the bird called phœnicurus, are <lb/>
            changed one into the other. The erithacus is a winter bird, <lb/>
            the phœnicurus a summer bird ; they differ in nothing but <lb/>
            the colour. The sycalis and melancoryphus are the same, for <lb/>
            these also are interchanged. The sycalis is found in the <lb/>
            autumn, and the melancoryphus immediately after the end <lb/>
            of the autumn. They also differ from each other in nothing <lb/>
            but their colour and voice, and to prove that it is the same <lb/>
            bird, each kind has been seen immediately after the change <lb/>
            took place; and when the change was not quite complete, <lb/>
            there was nothing characteristic of either form. Nor is it <lb/>
            absurd to suppose that these birds change their voices or <lb/>
            their colours, for the dove utters no sound in the winter, <lb/>
            unless it may be on a fine day in a severe winter, when it <lb/>
            will utter its sound to the astonishment of those that know <lb/>
            its habits ; and as soon as spring commences, it begins to <lb/>
            utter its voice: and, on the whole, birds make the greatest <lb/>
            number and variety of voices at the season of coition.</p>
          <p>4. The cuckoo also changes its colour, and its voice is not <lb/>
            distinct, when it is about to leave us. It goes away about <lb/>
            the time when the dog-star rises, it having been with us <lb/>
            from the commencement of spring to that time. The <lb/>
            œnanthe, as it is called, disappears when Sirius rises, and <pb n="277"/>
            <note type="margin">B. IX.]</note> <lb/>
            comes again when it sets, for sometimes it retreats before <lb/>
            the cold, and sometimes before the heat. The hoopoe also <lb/>
            changes its colour and its forms, as Æschylus writes. " He <lb/>
            had variegated this hoopoe, the witness of its own evils, and <lb/>
            has displayed the bold bird that dwells in the rock in <lb/>
            all armour. In the early spring it shakes the feathers <lb/>
            of the white hawk; for it has two forms, that of the <lb/>
            young bird and of itself, from one origin. And when the <lb/>
            young corn of the harvest begins to grow, it is clothed in <lb/>
            spotted feathers; and it always hates this place of Pal­ <lb/>
            lene, and inhabits deserted forests and mountains. "</p>
          <p>5. Some birds dust themselves, and others bathe. Some <lb/>
            neither dust nor bathe. Those that do not fly, but live on <lb/>
            the ground, dust themselves, as the domestic fowl, partridge, <lb/>
            grouse, lark, and pheasant. Those birds which have <lb/>
            straight claws, and live near rivers, marshes, and the sea, <lb/>
            bathe themselves. Some, like the pigeon and sparrow, both <lb/>
            dust and bathe. Most of those with crooked claws do nei­ <lb/>
            ther the one nor the other. This is their nature in these <lb/>
            matters. The act of breaking wind backwards is peculiar <lb/>
            to some birds, as the turtle. Such birds make a strong <lb/>
            motion with their rumps when they utter their voice.</p>

          <p>1. ANIMALS not only change their forms and dispositions at <lb/>
            particular ages and seasons, but also when castrated. All <lb/>
            animals that have testicles may be castrated. Birds and <lb/>
            oviparous quadrupeds have internal testicles near their loins. <lb/>
            In viviparous animals with feet, they are generally external, <lb/>
            though sometimes internal; in all they are situated at the <lb/>
            extremity of the abdomen. Birds are castrated near the <lb/>
            rump, the part with which they touch the female in copu­ <lb/>
            lation, for if they are burnt in that part two or three times <lb/>
            with irons after they are full grown, the comb turns yellow, <lb/>
            and they cease to crow, and no longer desire sexual inter­ <lb/>
            course. If they are not full grown, these parts never reach <lb/>
            perfection.</p>
          <p>2. The same is the case with the human subject, for if a <lb/>
            boy is castrated, the hair that is produced after birth never <lb/>
            appears, nor does his voice change, but continues sharp; <lb/>
            but if a full grown man is castrated, all the hair produced <pb n="278"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. IX.</note> <lb/>
            after birth falls off except that on the pubes, this becomes <lb/>
            weaker, but still remains. The hair produced at birth does <lb/>
            not fall off, for the eunuch never becomes bald. The voice <lb/>
            also of castrated animals changes to that of the female. Other <lb/>
            animals, if not castrated when young, are destroyed by the <lb/>
            operation ; with the boar it makes no difference. All ani. <lb/>
            mats, if castrated when young, become larger and more <lb/>
            graceful than those not castrated; but if already grown, <lb/>
            they never become any larger.</p>
          <p>3. If stags are castrated before they are old enough to <lb/>
            have horns, these never appear; but if castrated after they <lb/>
            have horns, their size never varies, nor are they subject to <lb/>
            their annual change. Calves are castrated at a year old, if <lb/>
            not they become bad and inferior. The steer is castrated in <lb/>
            this manner: they lay down the animal and cut the scrotum, <lb/>
            and press out the testicles; they next contract the root <lb/>
            of the testicle as much as possible, and fill up the wound <lb/>
            with hair in order that the discharge may escape, and if it <lb/>
            inflames, they cauterize and sprinkle the scrotum. If adult <lb/>
            bulls are castrated, they are still apparently capable of <lb/>
            sexual intercourse.</p>
          <p>4. The capria of the sow is also cut out, so that they <lb/>
            should not desire coition, but fatten rapidly. They are cut <lb/>
            after fasting two days. They hang them up by the hind <lb/>
            legs and make an incision in the lower part of the belly, <lb/>
            where the testicles of the male are generally found; the <lb/>
            capria is there formed upon the matrix, from which they cut <lb/>
            off a portion, and sew up the wound again.</p>
          <p>5. The female camels also are cut when they wish to take <lb/>
            them to war, that they may not become pregnant Some of <lb/>
            those in the upper parts of Asia possess as many as three <lb/>
            thousand. Such camels, when they run, are far more swift <lb/>
            than the Nisaean horses, from the length of their stretch. <lb/>
            And on the whole, castrated animals are longer-bodied than <lb/>
            those not castrated.</p>
          <p>6. All animals that ruminate, derive as much use and <lb/>
            pleasure from rumination as from eating. Animals that <lb/>
            have not cutting-teeth in both jaws ruminate, as the ox, <lb/>
            sheep, and goat. No observations have been made on wild <lb/>
            animals except those which occasionally associate with men, <lb/>
            as the stag, though this animal ruminates. They all lie down <pb n="279"/>
            <note type="margin">B. IX.]</note> <lb/>
            to ruminate, and do so most in the winter; those which are <lb/>
            brought up in shelter ruminate for nearly seven months. <lb/>
            Those that live in herds, ruminate for a shorter period, for <lb/>
            they live out of doors. Some animals with cutting teeth in <lb/>
            both jaws, ruminate, as the Pontic mice and the fish, which, <lb/>
            from this process, is called meryx. Animals with long legs <lb/>
            have loose bellies, and those with broad chests vomit more <lb/>
            easily than others, in quadrupeds, birdn, and the generality <lb/>
            of mankind. <pb n="280"/>

          <p>IF men and women, after they have reached a certain age, <lb/>
            do not have children after cohabition, the fault sometimes <lb/>
            rests with both, and sometimes in only one of them. And <lb/>
            first, it is requisite to examine the uterus of the female, that <lb/>
            if the fault lies there it may be relieved by proper treatment. <lb/>
            If the fault is not there, attention must be paid to some other <lb/>
            cause of sterility. We may conclude that this organ is in <lb/>
            a healthy state, when, like the other parts of the body, it <lb/>
            performs its functions without pain, and is free from fatigue <lb/>
            after the function is performed. Just as the eye is in a <lb/>
            healthy state if it suffers no pain in seeing, and is not dis­ <lb/>
            ordered with the exercise of its function, or unable to per­ <lb/>
            form it again, so the uterus is healthy which suffers no <lb/>
            pain, and is well able to perform its functions, whatever <lb/>
            they may be, and after they are performed is not impotent, <lb/>
            but is free from fatigue.</p>
          <p>2. The uterus is said to be disordered, when, even if it <lb/>
            performs its functions properly and without pain, it does <lb/>
            not binder its function by any part of itself.1 As there <lb/>
            is nothing to prevent an eye from seeing accurately, although <lb/>
            all its parts are not perfect, or if there happens to be a <lb/>
            tumour in it; so the uterus may have received no injury <lb/>
            in this respect, if it is properly situated in the right place. <lb/>
            In the first place, then, the healthy uterus will not be situ­ <lb/>
            ated in this place or in that, but will always be in a similar <lb/>
            position; but it is not difficult to decide whether it is not <lb/>
            placed at too great a distance without suffering and pain, or <lb/>
            whether it is devoid of sensation when touched. That these <lb/>
            parts ought to be properly placed is evident from the follow­ <lb/>
            ing considerations, for if the uterus is not near, it will not <lb/>
            be able to imbibe the semen, for the place from which it <note type="footnote"> 1 A corrupt passage. </note> <pb n="281"/>
            <note type="margin">B. X.]</note> <lb/>
            ought to receive it will be at too great a distance. If the <lb/>
            uterus is near, and not able to retire further, it will be use­ <lb/>
            less, for it will be always touched so as to refuse to open; <lb/>
            but it ought to do this, and to be obedient to its function. <lb/>
            These things ought to be thus ordered, and if they are not, <lb/>
            the case requires attention.</p>
          <p>3. The catamenia also should proceed correctly, that is, if <lb/>
            the general health is good, they should last for their proper <lb/>
            time, and not come irregularly, for when the catamenia are <lb/>
            right, the uterus will open properly, and receive the fluids <lb/>
            of the body whenever they are secreted; but when they <lb/>
            make their appearance too often, or not often enough, or <lb/>
            irregularly, while the rest of the body does not sympathise <lb/>
            with them, and the general health is good, we must look to <lb/>
            the uterus for the cause of their irregularity. The dul­ <lb/>
            ness of the uterus prevents its being opened at the proper <lb/>
            time, so that it receives but a small portion, or rather the <lb/>
            uterus imbibes the fluid from some inflammation of the <lb/>
            parts. So that it shows that it requires attention, like the <lb/>
            eyes, the bladder, the stomach, and other parts. For all the <lb/>
            parts, when inflamed, imbibe the fluid which is secreted into <lb/>
            each place, but not such a fluid, or in so great quantities.</p>
          <p>4. In like manner, if the uterus secretes more than it <lb/>
            ought to do, it exhibits an inflammatory tendency, if the <lb/>
            secretion is regular but too abundant; but if the secretion <lb/>
            is irregular, or more putrid than it should be in healthy <lb/>
            subjects, the disease is then quite manifest, for it is neces­ <lb/>
            sary that some pain should show that all is not well. In a <lb/>
            healthy subject, at the commencement, and the cessation of <lb/>
            menstruation, the secretion appears white and putrid. All <lb/>
            those subjects in whom the secretion is more putrid than in <lb/>
            healthy persons, or is irregular, or too abundant, or deficient, <lb/>
            should receive attention, for this it is that prevents child- <lb/>
            bearing. But in those subjects who are only irregular, and <lb/>
            unequal in the periods of the secretion, the disease is not <lb/>
            the preventive of child-bearing, though it shows that the <lb/>
            habit of the uterus is changeable, and does not always re­ <lb/>
            main the same. And this affection is sufficient to prevent <lb/>
            those persons from conception who are otherwise well dis­ <lb/>
            posed towards it. It is, however, hardly a disease, but an <lb/>
            affection which may be restored without medical treatment, <lb/>
            unless it is affected by some previous fault.. <pb n="282"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin">[B. X.</note> 5. If the regularity and quantity of the discharge is subject <lb/>
            to alteration, without any corresponding change in the rest of <lb/>
            the body, which is sometimes in a more fluid, at other times in <lb/>
            a more dry state, the uterus is not in fault, though it ought <lb/>
            to follow the habit of the rest of the body, and receive and <lb/>
            secrete in proportion. If the body is in a good state of <lb/>
            health, but undergoing a change, when this takes place, <lb/>
            and there is no need of medical treatment; but if the secre­ <lb/>
            tion is too small from disease, and the secretion is taken <lb/>
            through some other source, the body suffers : and if the dis­ <lb/>
            charge is too great, from all the secretions of the body being <lb/>
            turned in one direction, this does not point to disease of the <lb/>
            uterus, but of the whole body. Whenever the catamenia <lb/>
            coincide with the general habit of the body, it is evident that <lb/>
            the fault does not lie with the uterus, which would perform <lb/>
            its functions properly if the general health were correct.</p>
          <p>6. Sometimes the uterus is weak, and sometimes strong; <lb/>
            sometimes too fluid, and sometimes too dry; and the dis­ <lb/>
            charge coincides with the state of the body, it is abundant <lb/>
            when that is full, deficient when it is less full. If the body <lb/>
            is full of fluid, the discharge is watery ; if the body is dry, <lb/>
            it is more sanguineous ; it begins with being white, like milk, <lb/>
            and is without smell. Some are dark-coloured, and when <lb/>
            about to cease they become white, at the last secretion. The <lb/>
            white discharge has not the smell of putrid matter, but is <lb/>
            more harsh and disagreeable, nor has it the smell of pus; and <lb/>
            when this is the condition of the symptoms, there is no wear­ <lb/>
            ing away, but the body becomes heated. In all that are in this <lb/>
            state, the uterus is in a healthy condition for child-bearing.</p>

          <p>WE must, then, first of all inquire whether all these parti­ <lb/>
            culars are well ordered; and, next, we must learn the posi­ <lb/>
            tion of the body of the uterus; for it ought to be straight; <lb/>
            and if it is not so, the seminal fluid can never reach it. And <lb/>
            it is evident that women project their semen forwards, from <lb/>
            what happens when they have lascivious dreams; for this <lb/>
            part of them then requires attention, being moistened as <lb/>
            though they had sexual intercourse, for they also project into <lb/>
            the place where the semen of the male is emitted, and not into <lb/>
            the uterus; and when projected to this place, the semen is <pb n="283"/>
            <note type="margin">B. X.]</note> <lb/>
            drawn into the uterus by inhalation, as the mucus is drawn <lb/>
            into the nose. For this reason they become pregnant in <lb/>
            every position; for the seminal fluid both in men and women <lb/>
            is always projected forwards; but if it were projected into <lb/>
            the female she would not always conceive after copulation.</p>
          <p>2. But if the uterus is not straight, but inclined to the <lb/>
            hips, the loins, or the hypogastric region, it is impossible to <lb/>
            conceive, for the before-mentioned reason, that the uterus <lb/>
            cannot take up the seminal fluid. If this deformity is great, <lb/>
            either naturally or from disease, the disorder is incurable. <lb/>
            If there is a rupture, either by nature or arising from the <lb/>
            disease, which contracts the parts with inflammation, the <lb/>
            disorder will take a different turn from this. But in order <lb/>
            that women may become pregnant, it is necessary, as it was <lb/>
            said, that the mouth of the uterus should be straight and, <lb/>
            moreover, should be well opened. By this I mean that when the <lb/>
            menstrual discharge commences, the os uteri should, on con. <lb/>
            tact, appear softer than before, though not distinctly expanded. <lb/>
            But if this is the case, let the first appearance be white.</p>
          <p>3. But when the appearances are more the colour of <lb/>
            flesh, the uterus will be evidently relaxed without pain <lb/>
            when it is touched, and the os uteri is neither dull nor dif­ <lb/>
            ferent from itself; and when the discharge ceases, let the <lb/>
            aperture be very open and dry, but not hard, for a day and <lb/>
            a half or two days; for this shows that the uterus is in a <lb/>
            healthy state, and fit to perform its functions. If the os <lb/>
            uteri is not immediately relaxed, but appears soft, it shows <lb/>
            that both the uterus and the rest of the body are relaxed, <lb/>
            and the uterus does not prevent, but first discharges the <lb/>
            secretion from the os uteri. And when the rest of the body <lb/>
            has discharged a great deal, and the os uteri becomes re­ <lb/>
            laxed, it is a sign of a healthy condition.</p>
          <p>4. And when the appearances cease to take place directly, <lb/>
            the uterus shows that, if there is any difficulty, it will be­ <lb/>
            come empty and dry, and wanting in moisture, and there will <lb/>
            be no remains in the passage. When the uterus, therefore, <lb/>
            is capable of contraction, it shows that it is in a proper state <lb/>
            for receiving whatever is brought to it, when it is in this <lb/>
            state without pain, and indeed is insensate; and it is good <lb/>
            that the os uteri should not be in any other condition. <lb/>
            This shows that there is no reason why it should not close <pb n="284"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. X. </note> <lb/>
            at the proper time. This is the manner of considering the <lb/>
            os uteri, whether it is in a healthy condition or not.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER III.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THESE ought to be the symptoms of the uterus itself after <lb/>
            purification. First of all, that the woman should dream of <lb/>
            sexual intercourse, and project her seminal fluid readily, as <lb/>
            if a man were lying with her; and if this symptom occur <lb/>
            frequently, it is better. And when she has arisen, some­ <lb/>
            times she should require the same treatment as if she <lb/>
            had been with a man, sometimes she should be dry; but this <lb/>
            dryness should not be immediate; but after awaking she <lb/>
            should be fluid, sooner or later, about as much as half a <lb/>
            short day. The humidity should be of the same kind as if <lb/>
            she had been with a man. For all this shows that the uterus <lb/>
            is in a fit state to receive what is given it, and that the <lb/>
            cotyledons are drawn up and will retain what they have <lb/>
            received, and be unwilling to part with it.</p>
          <p>2. A flatulent state of the uterus is also a good sign, <lb/>
            when it enlarges and discharges the wind as the bowels do <lb/>
            without pain, and when it becomes larger and smaller with­ <lb/>
            out any symptom of disease; for these symptoms show that <lb/>
            the uterus is not in want of what is necessary nor slug­ <lb/>
            gish, either naturally or from disease, but that it will be <lb/>
            able to find room by growth for anything that it may re­ <lb/>
            ceive, for it has the power of dilation. When this is not <lb/>
            the case, the uterus is too thick, or some natural defect or <lb/>
            disease has rendered it insensible. For this cause it cannot <lb/>
            nourish, but it will destroy the embryo, if the symptoms <lb/>
            are violent, while the embryo is small; if they are less so, <lb/>
            when it is larger; if the uterus is slightly affected, the <lb/>
            offspring will be inferior, as if it had been fed in an inferior <lb/>
            vessel.</p>
          <p>3. Upon contact, the right and left side will be found to <lb/>
            be alike, and all the other parts in the same way; and in <lb/>
            the act of copulation moisture will be produced, not fre­ <lb/>
            quently nor in great abundance. This affection is, as it <lb/>
            were, a perspiration of the place, like the saliva, which is <lb/>
            frequently produced both in the use of food and in speaking. <lb/>
            Tears also are shed from the eyes, when we look upon bril. <lb/>
            liant objects, and under cold or greater heat, of which these <pb n="285"/>
            <note type="margin">B. X.]</note> <lb/>
            parts also partake, when they happen to be moist. So the <lb/>
            uterus becomes moist when employed, when it is of a more <lb/>
            moist disposition. Those that are in the best health suffer <lb/>
            from this affection, for which reason women always require <lb/>
            more or less attention, as also the mouth requires saliva. <lb/>
            In some this moisture is so abundant that they cannot <lb/>
            imbibe the seminal fluid of the man in a state of purity, <lb/>
            on account of its admixture with this uterine mois­ <lb/>
            ture.</p>
          <p>4. Besides these affections, the following also is to be con­ <lb/>
            sidered, whether, when they dream of sexual intercourse, their <lb/>
            general health is good or not, as whether they are weak, and <lb/>
            whether they are so always, or only sometimes, and whether <lb/>
            they are not sometimes strong, and whether they are dry at <lb/>
            first and moist afterwards ; for this ought to be the condition <lb/>
            of a woman capable of child-bearing; for relaxation shows <lb/>
            that the body has been profuse of the seminal fluid, and <lb/>
            that it can perform its functions; but when the uterus is <lb/>
            hard, it is a sign of debility. If a woman has this affection <lb/>
            without any disease, it shows that the emission takes place <lb/>
            naturally and as it ought to do. For if it were not so, there <lb/>
            would be disease and prostration of strength. Sometimes, <lb/>
            when the uterus is dry and afterwards becomes moist, it is <lb/>
            a sign that the whole body receives and makes away with <lb/>
            the seminal fluid, and that both the uterus and the body are <lb/>
            strong; for it has been already observed that the uterus <lb/>
            absorbs the semen which is placed upon it by the process of <lb/>
            inhalation, for it is not emitted into it but upon the same <lb/>
            place as that of the man. All that takes by inhalation is <lb/>
            accompanied with force, so that it is plain that the body of <lb/>
            such a person must have the power of retraction.</p>
          <p>5. It sometimes happens that women who have lascivious <lb/>
            dreams, or men of strong passions, are robust not from strength <lb/>
            but from health. This takes place when a large quantity of <lb/>
            seminal fluid has been collected near the place from whence <lb/>
            they emit it. If this makes its escape, they are in no ways <lb/>
            debilitated; for they are not relaxed by the loss of a <lb/>
            portion, if sufficient remains behind, or if that which was <lb/>
            emitted was useless, nor if it was emitted easily, as if they <lb/>
            parted with superfluous matter. For which reason such <lb/>
            persons are not robust from strength but from dullness. But <pb n="286"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. X.</note> <lb/>
            when any part is emitted which is necessary for the bodr, <lb/>
            they become debilitated.</p>
          <p>6. If a person is in good health, and of a proper age, the <lb/>
            seminal fluid is rapidly formed This takes place in those <lb/>
            that have not done growing and in those that are grown. <lb/>
            Women rarely know when they are first pregnant; for <lb/>
            they do not think that they have conceived unless they <lb/>
            perceive that the semen has been emitted, suspecting that <lb/>
            it ought to be emitted at the same time both by the fe­ <lb/>
            male and the male; and it escapes their notice, more es­ <lb/>
            pecially when they think that they are unable to conceive, <lb/>
            unless they have become dry, and that which they have <lb/>
            received has disappeared entirely; but it sometimes hap­ <lb/>
            pens that both the male and the female emit more than <lb/>
            could possibly disappear, and more than enough for concep­ <lb/>
            tion. When sufficient has been drawn in and much left <lb/>
            out, they become pregnant without knowing it.</p>
          <p>7. That it is possible that this should take place, and that <lb/>
            the affection does not arise from the whole of the seminal fluid, <lb/>
            we may learn from those animals which produce many young <lb/>
            ones from a single act of intercourse, or from the case of <lb/>
            twins produced by a single act. It is evident that they are <lb/>
            not produced from the whole semen, but each place receives <lb/>
            some portion of it, but the larger portion is left behind; and <lb/>
            if many young are produced from a single act of intercourse, <lb/>
            which appears to be the case with swine and with twins, it <lb/>
            is evident that the semen cannot come from every part of <lb/>
            the body, but it is divided out to each form. It is possible, <lb/>
            therefore, that it may be separated from every part of the <lb/>
            body, and that the whole may be divided among many, so <lb/>
            that it is not possible that all should have every part. The <lb/>
            female also projects her semen into the os uteri, where the <lb/>
            man also emits his, when he approaches her. From thence <lb/>
            she imbibes with inhalation as if it were with the mouth or <lb/>
            nostrils ; for whatever is not joined to the members is either <lb/>
            hollow above and united by a symphysis, or is sucked in from <lb/>
            this place by the act of inhalation. For which reason they <lb/>
            take care that it should be dry, as if this had happened before.</p>
          <p>8. The path along which it passes is thus formed in <lb/>
            women. There is a tube enclosed in the body like the penis <lb/>
            of the male. The inhalation takes place through this by a <pb n="287"/>
             <note type="margin">B. X.]</note> <lb/>
            small passage above the passage for the urine. When, there­ <lb/>
            fore, they desire sexual intercourse, this part is not in the <lb/>
            same condition as it was before. A falling down takes place <lb/>
            from this passage, and the fore part of the uterus becomes <lb/>
            much larger than the part where it falls into this passage. <lb/>
            This resembles the nostrils; for, as the nostrils have a pas­ <lb/>
            sage into the pharynx and into the external air, so this tube <lb/>
            has a very small and narrow passage, like a passage out for the <lb/>
            wind. That to the fore part of the uterus is wide and broad, <lb/>
            as the nostrils are to the external air between the mouth <lb/>
            and the pharynx. So women have a larger passage to the <lb/>
            fore part of the uterus, and wider than the external passage.</p>
          <p>9. Whatever conjecture is formed concerning these affec­ <lb/>
            tions, it makes to the same conclusion, that the woman <lb/>
            also emits a seminal fluid. The same things arise from the <lb/>
            same cause, for to some it seems to be the cause of disease <lb/>
            or of death; and these consider the end at the beginning <lb/>
            as it ought to be considered; for to some women these are <lb/>
            important causes, to some of no importance; and of these <lb/>
            causes some are and some are not of consequence. They <lb/>
            divide also in proportion the consequences which may result <lb/>
            from them. To some it happens to pass through all these <lb/>
            affections; to those who have many, through many of them : <lb/>
            others through few ; and others, again, who have none, <lb/>
            through none of them.</p>
          <p>10. There are some persons who suffer from the affection <lb/>
            called inflation. This ought not to be. The affection is of <lb/>
            this kind. In copulation they neither evidently emit semen, <lb/>
            nor do they become pregnant. Wherefore they are said to <lb/>
            be inflated. The excessive dryness of the uterus is the cause <lb/>
            of this complaint; and when it has drawn the fluid into itself, <lb/>
            it ejects it again. This becomes dried up, and having become <lb/>
            small falls out, without any notice being taken of the circum­ <lb/>
            stance on account of its size. When the uterus is violently <lb/>
            affected in this way, and becomes very dry, and ejects it <lb/>
            very soon, it is plain that pregnancy cannot take place. If <lb/>
            this does not take place very soon, impregnation appears for <lb/>
            a time to have taken place until it is ejected. The same <lb/>
            thing also takes place at times in those who have conceived <lb/>
            properly; if a long time has elapsed, the uterus becomes <lb/>
            elevated, so that it plainly appears as if impregnation had <pb n="288"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. X.</note> <lb/>
            taken place until it falls out. Then all becomes as it was <lb/>
            at first. They refer this affliction to a divine origin. It is <lb/>
            curable, unless it is natural, or the disease has gone a great <lb/>
            way. It is a sign that this disease is not present, when <lb/>
            women appear neither to have emitted semen, nor to have <lb/>
            conceived after sexual intercourse.</p>

          <p>1. PREGNANCY is prevented also by spasm in the uterus. This <lb/>
            complaint attacks the uterus when it is either distended with <lb/>
            inflammation, or in the act of parturition. When any large <lb/>
            quantity of matter suddenly enters it, and the os uteri is <lb/>
            not open, spasm then arises from distension. It is a sign of <lb/>
            the absence of spasm, if the uterus does not appear to reach <lb/>
            inflammation in its functions : whereas, if spasm were pre­ <lb/>
            sent, there would be some signs of inflammation. Again, a <lb/>
            swelling at the mouth of the uterus, if it is much drawn out, <lb/>
            will prevent conception. It is a sign that this is not the <lb/>
            case, when the uterus appears to open and close properly <lb/>
            after the discharge of the catamenia, or the use of the male.</p>
          <p>2. In some, also, the os uteri is closed, either from the period <lb/>
            of birth, or in consequence of disease. Sometimes this is <lb/>
            curable, and sometimes not so. It is not, however, diffi­ <lb/>
            cult to ascertain the state of the case, for it is not possible <lb/>
            either to receive or to emit anything in a proper manner. <lb/>
            If it appears to have received and rejected the seminal fluid <lb/>
            of the male, it is an evidence of the presence of the disease. <lb/>
            But those who have no impediment in the way of concep­ <lb/>
            tion, but are, as it has been said, as they ought to be, unless <lb/>
            the man is impotent, or they are not able to have children <lb/>
            together, being unable to emit their semen at the same <lb/>
            time, and differ very much, such persons will have no chil­ <lb/>
            dren.</p>

          <p>IN order to understand of sterility in the male, we must <lb/>
            take other symptoms. These will appear very easy, if he <lb/>
            copulates with other women, and impregnates them. When <lb/>
            the sexes do not appear to concur with each other, although <lb/>
            all the before-mentioned circumstances are present, they do <lb/>
            not nave children together. For it is evident that this is the <pb n="289"/>
            <note type="margin">B. X.]</note> <lb/>
            only reason of sterility: for if the woman contributes to <lb/>
            the semen and generation, it is evident that both the sexes <lb/>
            should be concurrent: for if the man is quick, and the <lb/>
            woman slow, in the emission of the semen (and many women <lb/>
            are comparatively slow), this will prevent conception; for <lb/>
            which cause they do not produce children by sexual union <lb/>
            with each other. They do so, however, when they happen to <lb/>
            be concurrent with each other; for if the woman is desirous, <lb/>
            and prepared for the intercourse, and is inclined for it, but <lb/>
            the man is suffering previous pain, and of a cold disposition, <lb/>
            it is then also necessary that they should be concurrent.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER VI.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>IT is quite plain when animals desire sexual intercourse; for <lb/>
            the female pursues the male, as hens pursue the cock and <lb/>
            place themselves beneath him, if the male is not desirous. <lb/>
            Other animals also do the same. But if all animals appear to <lb/>
            have these affections with respect to sexual intercourse, it is <lb/>
            plain that the causes must be the same throughout. This <lb/>
            bird, however, has not only the desire of receiving, but also <lb/>
            of emitting semen. This is a proof of it. If the male is <lb/>
            not present, she will emit the semen into herself, and be­ <lb/>
            come pregnant, and produce barren eggs, as if she desired <lb/>
            both to emit semen, and when she had done so, soon ceased, <lb/>
            just as when the male was present. Others also do the <lb/>
            same, for a person has attempted to rear some singing lo­ <lb/>
            custs, which he had taken in a young state. When grown, <lb/>
            they became pregnant spontaneously.</p>
          <p>2. From these considerations it is plain that every female <lb/>
            contributes to the semen, if this appears to take place in any <lb/>
            one class of animals, for the barren animal differs in no re­ <lb/>
            spect from the other, except that it does not produce <lb/>
            an animal, and this because it was formed by the union of <lb/>
            both sexes. For this reason all the seminal fluid of the <lb/>
            male does not appear to be productive, but some parts are <lb/>
            barren, when not properly compounded from both sexes. <lb/>
            And when women have lascivious dreams, the same affec­ <lb/>
            tions of weakness and debility often occur, as if they had <lb/>
            been lying with a male. It is plain, therefore, that if they <lb/>
            appear to have emitted a seminal fluid in their dream, they <lb/>
            will then conjecture that after their dream the same place <note type="footnote"> U </note> <pb n="290"/>
            <note type="margin">[B. X.</note> <lb/>
            will become moist, and they will be obliged to bestow the <lb/>
            same attention upon themselves as if they had had sexual <lb/>
            intercourse. So that it is evident that there must be an <lb/>
            emission of semen from both if it is to be productive.</p>
          <p>3. But the uterus does not emit its semen into itself, but <lb/>
            on the outside, into the place where that of the male also is <lb/>
            received, and then draws it into itself. For some females <lb/>
            produce spontaneously, as the bird produces barren eggs, <lb/>
            and other females do not so, as the horses and sheep; <lb/>
            either because the bird projects her semen into the uterus, <lb/>
            and the place upon which that of the male is emitted is not <lb/>
            external; for which reason, if he does not copulate properly <lb/>
            with the female, it is poured out upon the ground. But <lb/>
            in quadrupeds there is another place for the reception of <lb/>
            the semen, both of the male and female, which in other <lb/>
            animals it is combined with other fluids of the body, <lb/>
            and is not collected in the uterus, because it does not <lb/>
            enter it. But in birds, the uterus receives and matures <lb/>
            the seminal fluid, and forms a body similar in other respects <lb/>
            though not a living creature. It is necessary, therefore, <lb/>
            the living creature should be derived from both sexes.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER VII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>WE must enquire whether women speak the truth, when <lb/>
            they say that after a lascivious dream they find themselves <lb/>
            dry; for it is plain that the uterus draws upwards. And <lb/>
            if so, why do not females become pregnant spontaneously, <lb/>
            since the male seminal fluid is drawn in, mixed with their <lb/>
            own ? And why do not she goats draw that part of it <lb/>
            which extends outwards ? for this affection takes place <lb/>
            in some that have been pregnant many years ; for they pro­ <lb/>
            duce what is called myle (an amorphous mass of flesh), a <lb/>
            circumstance which has also happened to a certain woman; <lb/>
            for having had sexual intercourse, and to all appearance <lb/>
            conceived, the size of the uterus increased, and everything <lb/>
            at first went on regularly: but when the time of partu­ <lb/>
            rition arrived, she produced nothing, nor did the enlarge­ <lb/>
            ment become any smaller: but after three or four years, a <lb/>
            dysentery occurred, which placed her life in danger, when <lb/>
            she produced a large mass of flesh, which they call myle. <lb/>
            The affection continues in some to old age, even to the day <lb/>
            of their death, <pb n="291"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin">B. X.]</note> 2. Does this affection arise from a warm habit of body, <lb/>
            when the uterus is warm and dry, and for this reason capable <lb/>
            of drawing into itself in such a manner that it is taken up <lb/>
            and kept in it ? For, in persons so affected, if the seminal <lb/>
            fluid of both sexes is not united, but, like the barren egg, is <lb/>
            taken up by one sex, then the myle is produced, which <lb/>
            is not living creature, for it does not originate in both sexes, <lb/>
            nor is it lifeless, for it is taken to have life like the barren egg. <lb/>
            It remains, however, a long while, on account of the dispo­ <lb/>
            sition of the uterus, and because the bird, which has pro­ <lb/>
            duced many eggs in herself, when the uterus is stimulated <lb/>
            by these, goes and lays them: and when the first is pro­ <lb/>
            duced, the last will also come forth in proper time: for there <lb/>
            is nothing to prevent it, but the body being productive as <lb/>
            soon as it is full, causes the uterus to be no longer retentive. <lb/>
            But in viviparous animals, on account of the change of <lb/>
            force, as the foetus increases, and the diversity of food is re­ <lb/>
            quired, the uterus causes parturition from a kind of inflam­ <lb/>
            mation.</p>
          <p>3. But the flesh, because it is not alive, always requires <lb/>
            the same kind of food, for it does not cause any weight <lb/>
            in the uterus, nor any inflammation. So that the affec­ <lb/>
            tion would continue, in some cases, throughout life, un­ <lb/>
            less some fortunate debility should take place, as in the <lb/>
            woman who was attacked with dysentery. But does this <lb/>
            affection arise from warmth, as it was said, or rather from a <lb/>
            fluid state, because there is a fulness as it closes, either <lb/>
            because the uterus is neither cold enough to reject it, nor <lb/>
            warm enough to bring it to maturity ? Wherefore, the <lb/>
            disease lasts a long while, like those things which remain <lb/>
            a long while before they are matured; but those that are <lb/>
            about to come to maturity have an end, and that quickly. <lb/>
            Such uteri, being very high up, cause a long delay. And, <lb/>
            again, not being alive, it does not cause any pain by its <lb/>
            movements, for the movement of the ligament which the <lb/>
            living foetus produces, causes pain. And the hardness of <lb/>
            the substance is the effect of imperfect production, for it <lb/>
            is so hard that it cannot be cut by the stroke of an axe. <lb/>
            All ripe and mature things become soft, but imperfectly <lb/>
            digested things are immature and hard.</p>
          <p>it. Wherefore, many physicians, deceived by the resem- <note type="footnote"> U 2 </note> <pb n="292"/>
            <note type="margin">[ B. X.</note> <lb/>
            blance, say that women are suffering from myle, if they <lb/>
            only see the abdomen elevated without dropsy, and a ces-4 <lb/>
            Nation of the catamenia, when the disease has lasted for <lb/>
            a long while. But this is not the case, for the myle is <lb/>
            a rare disease. Sometimes there will be collections of cold <lb/>
            and moist excrements and fluids, and sometimes of thick <lb/>
            ones in this part of the abdomen, if either the nature or the <lb/>
            habit is of this kind. For these things afford neither <lb/>
            pain nor heat, on account of their cold nature ; but if they <lb/>
            increase, more or less, they bring no other disease after <lb/>
            them, but remain quiet, like some maimed thing.</p>
          <p>5. The cessation of the catamenia takes place on account of <lb/>
            the excrementitious matter of the body being directed to this <lb/>
            point, as when women are nursing; for they occur either not <lb/>
            at all, or only in small quantities. A collection of matter <lb/>
            from the flesh sometimes takes place between the uterus <lb/>
            and the stomach, which has the character of the myle, <lb/>
            but is not it. But it is not difficult to know the differ­ <lb/>
            ence, by touching the uterus; for if it is correctly placed, <lb/>
            and not enlarged, it is evident that the disease is not there; <lb/>
            but if it is the same as when with child, it will be warm, <lb/>
            and cold, and dry, because all the fluids are turned inwards; <lb/>
            and the os uteri will be in the same condition as when they <lb/>
            are pregnant; but if the enlargement is of any other kind, <lb/>
            it will be cold, and not dry when touched, and the os uteri <lb/>
            will always be the same.</p>

            Bryson the sophist; Ctesias of Cnidos; Herodotus of Ha­ <lb/>
            licarnassus; Syennesis of Cyprus; Poly bus; Democritus <lb/>
            of Abdera; Anaxagoras of Clazomene; Empedocles of Si­ <lb/>
            cily ; and if there are any more which do not just now occur <lb/>
            to my memory, they are accurately enumerated in the in­ <lb/>
            dex, with the names of the places to which they belonged. <lb/>
            I have said that it is probable, that Aristotle has derived in­ <lb/>
            formation from more authorities than he has named; and <lb/>
            a reason for this conjecture is found in a passage which he <lb/>
            extracts, almost verbatim, from Herodotus, on the Nilotic <lb/>
            crocodile (Euterpe, 68). This I have shewn in a note on <lb/>
            the passage, book v. ch. 27, 2. And there are many places, <lb/>
            both in his natural history and his other works on animals, <lb/>
            where our philosopher refers to the ancient fables of men <lb/>
            who were transformed into the nature and forms of various <lb/>
            animals. The oldest author of such fables is Boeus (or <lb/>
            Boeo, in the feminine gender, as some have conjectured). <lb/>
            From this book Antoninus Literalis has extracted many <lb/>
            chapters in Greek. Nicander of Colophon, and others, <lb/>
            followed the example of Boeus. Among Latin writers, <lb/>
            the Metamorphoses of Ovid have always commanded at­ <lb/>
            tention. All who have read the work of Antoninus, and <lb/>
             <pb n="294"/>
            the Metamorphoses of Ovid, will easily perceive how much <lb/>
            information on the nature and habits of animals our philo­ <lb/>
            sopher could have derived from the very character of the <lb/>
            books which had come down from the remotest antiquity <lb/>
            to the time of Aristotle (compare note 9, 17, 1), especially <lb/>
            if they bear in mind that the ancient teachers of physics <lb/>
            always compared the habits of animals with those of man, <lb/>
            and conjectured the causes and reasons of their actions, <lb/>
            from similar impulses in man. This may be seen in the <lb/>
            fables of Æsop, for they contain the first elements of the <lb/>
            doctrines of the ancients on physics and morals. We might <lb/>
            also offer a surmise on Eudoxus, and Scylax, and others, <lb/>
            who wrote Travels Round the Earthy in which they <lb/>
            described the animals of different countries ; for our philo­ <lb/>
            sopher appeals to the testimony of both these authors, <lb/>
            in his work on Meteorics, and elsewhere. There is more <lb/>
            doubt whether Aristotle used, or could have used, the nu­ <lb/>
            merous notices of animals, of the interior of Asia and <lb/>
            India, which the companions of Alexander, in his Asiatic <lb/>
            and Indian expeditions, brought back to Greece; which <lb/>
            Theophrastus, the pupil of Aristotle, and his successor in <lb/>
            the schools, is found to have used so well in his History of <lb/>
            Plants. For this I consider to be proved, that the written <lb/>
            notices of the companions of Alexander were published after <lb/>
            the death of the king, though we have no proof of the exact <lb/>
            year in which they were made public. Indeed I have never <lb/>
            found any evidence in the History of Animals which could <lb/>
            lead us to suppose that Aristotle was acquainted with the <lb/>
            animals of the interior of Asia and India, by information <lb/>
            derived from the companions of Alexander; nor have I <lb/>
            been able to find the slightest information from which I can <lb/>
            form a conjecture as to either the place or time when this <lb/>
            history was written : but, in order that others may institute <lb/>
            a more rigorous inquiry into the date and place of its <lb/>
            authorship, if any such have escaped my notice, I will <lb/>
            place before my readers that portion of the Aristotelian <lb/>
            chronology which relates to this work, from the disputation <lb/>
            of St. Croix, a learned French author (Examen Critique <lb/>
            des Historiens d'Alexander le Grand, p. 603, second edi­ <lb/>
            tion). Aristotle, therefore, at the invitation of Philip, <lb/>
            King of Macedon, undertook the education of his son, Alex­ <lb/>
             <pb n="295"/>
            ander, when he was thirteen years of age, in the second <lb/>
            year. of the 109th Olympiad, when Phythodotus was Archon <lb/>
            of Athens. Aristotle returned to Athens in the second year <lb/>
            of the 111th Olympiad, in the Archonship of Evænetus. <lb/>
            He taught at Athens for thirteen years, from whence he <lb/>
            fled to Chalets, and there he died, in the third year of the <lb/>
            114th Olympiad, during the Archonship of Philocles.</p>
          <p>There is, indeed, a passage in Pliny, (book x. ch. 64, sect. <lb/>
            84, on the fecundity of mice,) where he says, that among <lb/>
            other things Aristotle has spoken in his History of Animals <lb/>
            (vi. 29) of the gravid foetus of the Persian mice ; but the <lb/>
            Greek exemplar contains no authority from which Pliny <lb/>
            could have derived the words which he has added : " More <lb/>
            wonderful than all is the foetus of the mice, which we cannot <lb/>
            unhesitatingly receive, though derived from the authority of <lb/>
            Aristotle, and the soldiers of Alexander the Great." In <lb/>
            this and in two other places he calls those soldiers whom <lb/>
            others are in the habit of calling the companions of Alexander <lb/>
            the Great. But there is also a passage in the Meteorics of <lb/>
            Aristotle (iii. 1), where he mentions as a recent event the <lb/>
            destruction of the temple of Ephesus, by the incendiary <lb/>
            Herostratus, on the day of Alexander's birth, in these words : <lb/>
            " As it has just now happened in the burning of the temple <lb/>
            of Ephesus." This book, therefore, appears to have been <lb/>
            written at the commencement of the l06th Olympiad, and <lb/>
            with it the History of Animals is very closely connected, as <lb/>
            I have shown in my treatise on the order of the books of <lb/>
            Physics ; so that we may suppose that they were written in <lb/>
            nearly the same Olympiad, if we regard only the series of the <lb/>
            works; and no interruption occurred with which we are <lb/>
            unacquainted. On the other hand, in the Meteorics (iii. 5), <lb/>
            he speaks of a lunar rainbow, and says that it is rarely seen, <lb/>
            and then adds, " that it has occurred but twice in more than <lb/>
            fifty years." If we reckon these fifty years from the birth <lb/>
            of Aristotle, in the first year of the 99th Olympiad, that <lb/>
            book will fall in the third or fourth year of the 111th Olym­ <lb/>
            piad ; and from this calculation it would follow that this <lb/>
            book was also written in Athens, but that the first date is <lb/>
            to be taken in a wider sense.</p>
          <p>From all this, we may easily perceive that at this day we <lb/>
            are entirely ignorant of the sources of information collected <lb/>
             <pb n="296"/>
            either from ancient or contemporary writers, to which our <lb/>
            philosopher had access in composing and completing a work <lb/>
            of such multiplied and varied information. Even if we as­ <lb/>
            sume that they were as large as the mind of Aristotle was <lb/>
            great, acute, and transparent, still, for a work so various <lb/>
            and extensive, spread over seas, rivers, earth, and heaven, <lb/>
            even that mind would require some assistance from other <lb/>
            sources to which it might apply in constructing and building <lb/>
            up a system of general instruction from the materials col­ <lb/>
            lected in different places about various animals, and from the <lb/>
            observations used in describing and arranging them together <lb/>
            in orders, classes, genera, and species. The following were the <lb/>
            sources Aristotle used, according to the narrative of an uncer­ <lb/>
            tain author quoted by Pliny (viii. 16, 17)—“ King Alexander <lb/>
            the Great," he says, " was possessed with the desire of know­ <lb/>
            ing the natures of animals, and therefore delegated the work <lb/>
            to Aristotle, a man of very great learning. Some thousands <lb/>
            of men in the whole region of Asia and Greece obeyed his <lb/>
            commands, all, namely, who obtained their livelihood by <lb/>
            hunting, hawking, or fishing, or who had in their care mena­ <lb/>
            geries, herds, beehives, fishponds, or aviaries ; so that nothing <lb/>
            in nature might be unknown to him ; and from his examin­ <lb/>
            ation of these, he compiled those fifty celebrated volumes, <lb/>
            which I have collected into one, together with those animals <lb/>
            with which he was unacquainted, and I hope that they will be <lb/>
            consulted by good scholars." In all this there is nothing <lb/>
            contradictory to the mind and liberality of Alexander, or the <lb/>
            confidence or strength of his empire. But some may prefer <lb/>
            the story published by Ælian, in his various history (iv.</p>
          <p>19), who, I know not on what authority, transfers the nar­ <lb/>
            rative to Philip, the father of Alexander—“Having sup­ <lb/>
            plied abundance of riches to Aristotle, he was the means of <lb/>
            many other undertakings, and especially of his knowledge of <lb/>
            living creatures; and the son of Nichomachus completed <lb/>
            his history by the liberal assistance of Philip ; who also <lb/>
            honoured Plato and Theophrastus." If this be true, it evi­ <lb/>
            dently refers to those seven or eight years in which Aris­ <lb/>
            totle was in Macedonia presiding over the education of <lb/>
            Alexander, the son of Philip.</p>
          <p>These abundant supplies for the studies of Aristotle are <lb/>
            not at all inconsistent, either with the liberality of Philip. <lb/>
             <pb n="297"/>
            or his love for his son and his son's tutor, nor do they sur­ <lb/>
            pass credibility. The gold mines of Philippi supplied the <lb/>
            munificence and liberality of Philip. But there are difficul­ <lb/>
            ties in the narrative which make us question the credibility <lb/>
            of the author of this munificence. For instance, the <lb/>
            names of Plato and Theophrastus are mentioned ; but the <lb/>
            name of Theophrastus could not be so great and illustrious, <lb/>
            even if it were known to the Greeks at all, as to have at­ <lb/>
            tracted the liberality of Philip, before the death of his master <lb/>
            Aristotle, whom also he succeeded in the School at Athens. <lb/>
            I should, therefore, rather imagine that Ælian, who was <lb/>
            more diligent in the accuracy of his Attic diction than his <lb/>
            historical fidelity, has committed some error in the name of <lb/>
            Philip, or in those of Plato and Theophrastus, whom he has <lb/>
            appended to his narrative.</p>
          <p>The narrative of Athenæus, (ix. 398,) derived from the <lb/>
            report of an unknown author, is very different; he calls <lb/>
            the History of Animals a very expensive work, and then <lb/>
            adds—" There is a report that Aristotle received 800 talents <lb/>
            from Alexander, for writing the History of Animals"­ <lb/>
            a sum of money which Perigonius, in his Notes on Ælian, <lb/>
            estimates at 1,440,000 caroli. To this narrative, or, as <lb/>
            it may be more justly termed, rumour, is opposed the <lb/>
            opinion of Io. Henr. Schulzius, in his History of Medicine <lb/>
            (Leipsic, 1738, p. 358). "When I consider this matter <lb/>
            aright, it appears to me that the whole story is very doubt­ <lb/>
            ful, and, for the most part, fabulous. And it can easily <lb/>
            be proved, that the whole revenue of Macedon, if Alexander <lb/>
            had paid it all to Aristotle for several years, would not <lb/>
            have amounted to this sum. It is impossible, therefore, <lb/>
            that he could have paid so much to Aristotle before the <lb/>
            conquest of Asia; and after his expedition had been suc­ <lb/>
            cessfully accomplished, his affection was alienated from <lb/>
            Aristotle, and, in order to annoy him, he liberally en­ <lb/>
            riched other philosophers, who had done nothing to deserve <lb/>
            his patronage. Their labours, therefore, are in vain, who <lb/>
            demand justice of our excellent Aristotle, even in his grave, <lb/>
            because he did not use such an immense sum of money in <lb/>
            the composition of a more veracious history.</p>
          <p>" I am certainly of opinion that a great deal has been made, <lb/>
            as usual, of a very little matter, namely, that if Aristotle <lb/>
             <pb n="298"/>
            derived any assistance in that kingdom, all the materials <lb/>
            were provided for him while Philip was alive, and before <lb/>
            Alexander's expedition was undertaken, or in the first years <lb/>
            of the expedition. But afterwards, when Alexander had <lb/>
            set out, Aristotle returned to Athens, and was engaged in <lb/>
            teaching: nor could he have derived any advantage from <lb/>
            the resources which Pliny mentions, and the multitude of <lb/>
            persons who were instructed to place themselves under his <lb/>
            command, for he was not only occupied with other pursuits, <lb/>
            but would have been in danger of being destroyed by the <lb/>
            fury of the Athenians, on the plea that he was attempting <lb/>
            innovations, if he had even ventured to dissect animals, <lb/>
            not to say men."</p>
          <p>In a note he adds these observations:—" Aristobulus, no <lb/>
            unworthy companion of Alexander in his expedition, bears <lb/>
            testimony, according to Plutarch, that the whole military <lb/>
            chest did not contain seventy talents of coin. For the pre­ <lb/>
            paration of so arduous an undertaking, however, the same <lb/>
            person says, that two hundred talents ought to have been <lb/>
            taken for mutual exchange. I remember also to have read in <lb/>
            Eustathius's commentary on Homer, a very learned disqui­ <lb/>
            sition on the scarcity of money amongst the Macedonians, at <lb/>
            the time of Alexander's expedition; but I cannot lay my <lb/>
            hands upon the passage."</p>
          <p>I must confess that I am not influenced by this anno­ <lb/>
            tation, nor does the whole of this controversy appear to me <lb/>
            to have been properly conducted. For the greatest doubt <lb/>
            prevails as to the number of talents which Alexander is said <lb/>
            to have paid to Aristotle, to help him in his task; and the <lb/>
            report only rests on the authority of a writer who lived <lb/>
            centuries after the death of Alexander. To refute this <lb/>
            is useless labour, both because its origin is obscure, and <lb/>
            also because a sum of money set down in figures might <lb/>
            be easily corrupted by transcribers. But the testimony of <lb/>
            Aristobulus will give little or no assistance to the opinion <lb/>
            of the learned, if we adopt that which is most probable, <lb/>
            namely, that Philip, or his son Alexander, gave large sums <lb/>
            of money to Aristotle, to enable him to pursue his studies <lb/>
            in Natural History, while he lived in Macedon, and was <lb/>
            employed in the education of Alexander. The question <lb/>
            about the date when Aristotle arranged and published <lb/>
             <pb n="299"/>
            the materials and notes he had collected is quite distinct <lb/>
            and I do not think that it can be precisely ascertained at <lb/>
            the present time. The conjecture I have hazarded (light <lb/>
            enough, I must confess) does not say much in favour of the <lb/>
            story of abundant treasures supplied by Philip, or Alex­ <lb/>
            ander, to our philosopher, for the composition of his Na­ <lb/>
            tural History. But these persons form a very poor esti­ <lb/>
            mate of the study and labour bestowed by Aristotle upon <lb/>
            the History of Animals, who imagine that our philosopher <lb/>
            had only access to such books as now remain, forgetting <lb/>
            those of which time has robbed us.</p>
          <p>Most of all we must regret his Z<foreign xml:lang="grc">ωϊϰὰ</foreign>, which appears to <lb/>
            have given a more accurate description of animals, and his <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">άνατομιϰὰ</foreign>, which further contained notices of their internal <lb/>
            structure, and was illustrated by drawings to which he often <lb/>
            refers in his Natural History, as well as in his works on the <lb/>
            parts and the generation of animals. It will scarcely be <lb/>
            possible to fix with any accuracy on the number of books he <lb/>
            employed, after the great carelessness of librarians, and the <lb/>
            many facilities for error in copyists, arising from the method <lb/>
            of notation by letters. Antigonus Carystius, in his sixty- <lb/>
            sixth chapter, increases the number of volumes given by <lb/>
            Pliny, for he writes seventy; and if the titles of the books, <lb/>
            as they are given by Diogenes Laertius and Athenæus, are <lb/>
            compared with those published, the number of books re­ <lb/>
            lating to Animal History to which he may have had access <lb/>
            are readily estimated, even should every book of every work <lb/>
            be reckoned as a separate book, and the list compared with <lb/>
            the number given by Pliny.</p>
          <p>In the memory of our fathers and grandfathers (for, alas! <lb/>
            at the present time few trouble themselves with the works <lb/>
            of the ancients) there were many who blamed Aristotle for <lb/>
            these works, both for his manner of treating the subjects and <lb/>
            his narratives of the lives and habits of animals, and vexed <lb/>
            them with questions and disputations.</p>
          <p>These objections will be better answered, when we <lb/>
            come to those passages of the History. It may, however, <lb/>
            be of some general avail to put a stop to these objections, <lb/>
            which were urged against his manner of teaching; and I <lb/>
            hope to be able to point out some peculiar sources from <lb/>
            which Aristotle appears to have derived the more difficult <lb/>
             <pb n="300"/>
            parts of his History, and those which were obnoxious to <lb/>
            dispute.</p>
          <p>Amongst other foolish and trifling questions with which <lb/>
            some Grammarian, in the Deipnosophistæ of Athenæus, (viii. <lb/>
            p. 352,) has endeavoured not only to impugn, but even de­ <lb/>
            stroy our philosopher's credibility, is the following:—" I do <lb/>
            not much admire the diligence of Aristotle, though others <lb/>
            praise him so highly. At what time, I should like to know, <lb/>
            or from what Proteus or Nereus ascending from the deep. <lb/>
            to give him information, did he learn what the fishes were <lb/>
            doing there, and in what manner they slept and took their <lb/>
            food; for he writes things of this kind, which are only 4 the <lb/>
            miracles of fools,' as the comic poet says."</p>
          <p>I will not follow the rest of his argument, which relates <lb/>
            to terrestrial and winged animals; for the aquatic, and espe­ <lb/>
            cially the marine creatures, seem to offer the greatest oppor­ <lb/>
            tunity for questioning the fidelity of his narrative. In the <lb/>
            first place, then, we may observe, that of all mankind the <lb/>
            Greeks were amongst the greatest eaters of fish, at least <lb/>
            after the heroic and Homeric ages; for Homer is never <lb/>
            found to mention fish at the suppers and festivals of his <lb/>
            heroes. So that I should not wonder if the frequent and <lb/>
            repeated industry and observation of fishermen, following <lb/>
            their labours both in rivers and seas, to adorn the tables of <lb/>
            their fellow citizens, supplied ample and varied information <lb/>
            to learned men who were engaged in the investigation of <lb/>
            natural objects. By the same means they might learn <lb/>
            from hunters the haunts and dispositions of wild beasts, <lb/>
            and those of domesticated animals from husbandmen. <lb/>
            The whole life and labour of such men was devoted to the <lb/>
            uses, advantages, and food of man; and their observations <lb/>
            would be particularly directed to those animals which could <lb/>
            assist in sharing the labours of mankind, or whose flesh or <lb/>
            other parts were required for food or medicine. Their par­ <lb/>
            turition and its proper time, the number of their young, the <lb/>
            manner of bringing them up, their nutriment, the pastures <lb/>
            and food of the parents, and the proper time for hunting them, <lb/>
            were observed with the greatest accuracy. And if any <lb/>
            diseases arising from the weather, their food, or their drink <lb/>
            impended over them, and threatened their production or the <lb/>
            life of the wild cattle, or if a peculiar or common enemy <lb/>
             <pb n="301"/>
            laid in wait for the life of one or all, it could not easily <lb/>
            escape their observation; and from these circumstances we <lb/>
            may manifestly derive the origin of those fables and narra­ <lb/>
            tives- in which the opinions of animals are compared with <lb/>
            the life and manner of human beings, such as the simple <lb/>
            minds of hunters, fishers, and rustics could comprehend. <lb/>
            In these books of natural history we find traces of many <lb/>
            stories of this kind which it is unnecessary here to point <lb/>
            out.</p>
          <p>In the aquatic and marine orders of animals there is, be­ <lb/>
            sides these sources of information, the diligent investigation <lb/>
            instituted by certain writers throughout the seas and rivers <lb/>
            of Greece, at a time when every useful fish, and marine and <lb/>
            river animals of this class, mollusca, shell fish, and worms <lb/>
            formed part of their food. The time and manner of their <lb/>
            coition, parturition, pregnancy, and life, the nature of their <lb/>
            food, places and manner of taking fish, the times in which <lb/>
            they were not accessible, the faults and diseases of aquatic <lb/>
            animals, were minutely described. The twentieth chapter <lb/>
            of the eighth book of our History is on this subject, where <lb/>
            the food and diseases of aquatic animals are described, and <lb/>
            particular notice is taken of their use as food, besides the <lb/>
            observations on the manners of quadrupeds.</p>
          <p>It is very evident that the life of one man would hardly <lb/>
            suffice for the observation of all these facts even in a single <lb/>
            class of animals; but, as I have said, there were writers <lb/>
            before the time of Aristotle who provided for the tastes and <lb/>
            tables of these fish-eating Greeks a most exquisite apparatus <lb/>
            from the rivers and seas of Greece, especially in Sicily, which <lb/>
            has been remarkable for its wealth ever since the reigns of <lb/>
            Gelo and Hiero, and had surpassed the rest of Greece not <lb/>
            only in its knowledge of nature, but in the art of poetry.</p>
          <p>There is a passage in Plato's " Gorgias," (sect. 156, p. 246, <lb/>
            ed. Heind.) where mention is made of " Mithæcus, the author <lb/>
            of a work on Sicilian cookery, and Sarambus, the publican. <lb/>
            One furnished the best of food, the other the best of wine." <lb/>
            That the art of choosing and preparing food for the table <lb/>
            was treated of in this book we may conclude from the use <lb/>
            of the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">όψοποιΐα</foreign>, which the Greeks especially used to <lb/>
            signify the kinds of fish used for food. A passage from <lb/>
            this book on the manner of cooking the fish called tenia if <lb/>
             <pb n="302"/>
            quoted by Athenæus, who makes the title of this book <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">όψατυτιϰὸν</foreign>, vii. p. 282, and xii. p. 506.</p>
          <p>We cannot accurately ascertain the age of Mithæcus. The <lb/>
            most ancient author of such a book that we can call to mind <lb/>
            is Epicharmus, a Sicilian poet and physician, from whose <lb/>
            fragments, collected by Athenæus, we may certainly con­ <lb/>
            clude he was acquainted with the nature of aquatic animals.</p>
          <p>To this class we may, in the first place, refer those pas­ <lb/>
            sages which are extracted from the drama called the Mar. <lb/>
            riage of Hebe, or the Muses, and not only teach us the <lb/>
            nature of fishes, but also the manner of procuring and cook­ <lb/>
            ing them. A learned writer in the " Literary Ephemeris" of <lb/>
            Jena, 1810, (Nos. 156, 157,) attempted to collect all these <lb/>
            and reduce them to order. There remain, however, many <lb/>
            more passages which the conjectures of the most learned <lb/>
            could hardly amend or explain, from the corruption of the <lb/>
            text by librarians and the variety of Sicilian names. And <lb/>
            before the time of Epicharmus, Ananius, an Iambic poet, <lb/>
            nearly contemporary with Hipponactus, an Ionian poet, corn. <lb/>
            posed, among other poems, a similar work on cooking fish, <lb/>
            as we learn from a passage extracted by Athenæus, (vii. p. <lb/>
            282.) After Epicharmus there was Terpsion, a Sicilian, who <lb/>
            was the first to write a gastrology, in which he taught his <lb/>
            disciples from what kind of food they ought to abstain. He <lb/>
            is mentioned by Clearchus Solensis, a disciple of Aristotle, <lb/>
            in his work de Paræmiis, in " Athenæus," (viii. p. 337.)</p>
          <p>Clearchus also mentions Archestratus, the Sicilian, the <lb/>
            pupil of Terpsion, who, after having travelled through the <lb/>
            whole of Greece, wrote a work in heroic verse on the nature <lb/>
            of fishes, those especially which were fit for the table, and <lb/>
            on the manner of cooking and preparing them. We learn <lb/>
            that his book was called '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ηδυπὰθεια</foreign>, not only from the testi­ <lb/>
            mony of Athenæus, but from an imitation by Ennius. For <lb/>
            Ennius, who died A.U.C. 584, one hundred and fifty-two <lb/>
            years after the death of Aristotle, translated and in part <lb/>
            imitated the poem of Archestratus, and called his work <lb/>
            " Carmina Hedypathetica," as Apulegius tells us in his <lb/>
            " Apologia." We have good reason for supposing that <lb/>
            Arcnestratus was either contemporary with Aristotle, or a <lb/>
            little older. For Archestratus mentions Diodorus Aspen­ <lb/>
            dius, the Pythagorean, as his contemporary, to whom Timæus. <lb/>
             <pb n="303"/>
            the historian, tells us that the Epistle of Stratonicus was <lb/>
            written (" Athenæus," iv. p. 136). Therefore Archestratus, <lb/>
            Diodorus, Aspendius, and Stratonicus, an eminent harpist, <lb/>
            were contemporaries, and so they were with Aristotle and <lb/>
            Demosthenes; and this conjecture is confirmed by many <lb/>
            passages in Athenæus, where Stratonicus is reported to have <lb/>
            beenalive with those persons whom Demosthenes mentions <lb/>
            in his orations. Aristotle, therefore, may have used this <lb/>
            work of Archestratus in that part of his Natural History <lb/>
            which treats of the nature of fishes. 1</p>
          <p>The writings of physicians who prescribed the food, <lb/>
            both of sick and well, have handed down similar and much <lb/>
            more extensive observations on the animals and fishes which <lb/>
            were brought to the tables of the Greeks. Of this kind <lb/>
            Athenæus has given many passages from Doric, and Di­ <lb/>
            philus of Siphnus. Oribasius has made a long extract from <lb/>
            the work of Xenocrates, on the aquatic animals used in <lb/>
            food, which I purpose some day to publish with Xenocrates, <lb/>
            if my life should be spared long enough. <note type="footnote"> 1 To the end of this Essay are appended fragments of Archestratus, <lb/>
            on the fishes of Sicily, amounting to 270 lines of heroic verse, together <lb/>
            with notes, by the author of the Essay. </note></p>
