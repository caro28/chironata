          <p>PLUTARCH, who was born at Chæronea in Bceotia, <lb/>
            probably about A.D. 50, and was a contemporary of <lb/>
            Tacitus and Pliny, has written two works still extant, <lb/>
            the well-known Lives, and the less-known Moralia. The <lb/>
            Lives have often been translated, and have always been a <lb/>
            popular work. Great indeed was their power at the period <lb/>
            of the French Revolution. The Moralia, on the other hand, <lb/>
            consisting of various Essays on various subjects (only <lb/>
            twenty-six of which are directly ethical, though they have <lb/>
            given their name to the Moralia), are declared by Mr. Paley <lb/>
            " to be practically almost unknown to most persons in <lb/>
            Britain, even to those who call themselves scholars.”1 <lb/>
            Habent etiam sua fata libelli.</p>
          <p>In older days the Moralia were more valued. Montaigne, <lb/>
            who was a great lover of Plutarch, and who observes in <lb/>
            one passage of his Essays that " Plutarch and Seneca were <lb/>
            the only two books of solid learning he seriously settled <lb/>
            himself to read," quotes as much from the Moralia as from <lb/>
            the Lives. And in the seventeenth century I cannot but <lb/>
            think the Moralia were largely read at our Universities, at <lb/>
            least at the University of Cambridge. For, not to mention <lb/>
            the wonderful way in which the famous Jeremy Taylor has <lb/>
            taken the cream of " Conjugal Precepts " in his Sermon <lb/>
            called “ The Marriage Ring," or the large and copious use <note type="footnote"> 1 See article Plutarch, in Encyclopaedia Britannica, Ninth Edition. - </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="VIII"/>
            he has made in his " Holy Living " of three other Essays <lb/>
            in this volume, namely, those " On Curiosity," " On Re­ <lb/>
            straining Anger," and " On Contentedness of Mind," prov­ <lb/>
            ing conclusively what a storehouse he found the Moralia, <lb/>
            we have evidence that that most delightful poet, Robert <lb/>
            Herrick, read the Moralia, too, when at Cambridge, so that <lb/>
            one cannot but think it was a work read in the University <lb/>
            course generally in those days. For in a letter to his uncle <lb/>
            written from Cambridge, asking for books or money for <lb/>
            books, he makes the following remark : " How kind Arcisi­ <lb/>
            laus the philosopher was unto Apelles the painter, Plutark <lb/>
            in his Morals will tell you. ”1</p>
          <p>In 1882 the Reverend C. W. King, Senior Fellow of <lb/>
            Trinity College, Cambridge, translated the six " Theosophi­ <lb/>
            cal Essays " of the Moralia, forming a volume in Bohn's <lb/>
            Classical Library. The present volume consists of the <lb/>
            twenty-six " Ethical Essays," which are, in my opinion, <lb/>
            the cream of the Moralia, and constitute a highly interesting <lb/>
            series of treatises on what might be called " The Ethics of <lb/>
            the Hearth and Home." I have grouped these Essays in <lb/>
            such a manner as to enable the reader to read together <lb/>
            such as touch on the same or on kindred subjects.</p>
          <p>As is well known, the text of the Moralia is very corrupt, <lb/>
            and the reading very doubtful, in many places. In eight <lb/>
            of the twenty-six Essays in this volume I have had the <lb/>
            invaluable help of the text of Rudolf Hercher; help so <lb/>
            invaluable that one cannot but sadly regret that only one <lb/>
            volume of the Moralia has yet appeared in the Bibliotheca <lb/>
            Teubneriana. Wyttenbach's text and notes I have always <lb/>
            used when available, and when not so have fallen back <lb/>
            upon Reiske. Reiske is always ingenious, but too fond of <lb/>
            correcting a text, and the criticism of him by Wyttenbach <note type="footnote"> 1 Grosart's Herrick, vol. <unclear>i</unclear>. p. liii. See in this volume, p. 180, and <lb/>
            also note to p. 288. Richard Baxter again is always quoting the <lb/>
            Moralia. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="IX"/>
            is perhaps substantially correct. " In nullo auctore habita­ <lb/>
            bat; vagabatur per omnes: nec apud quemquam tamdiu <lb/>
            divertebat, ut in paulo interiorem ejus consuetudinem se <lb/>
            insinuaret." I have also bad constantly before me the <lb/>
            Didot Edition of the Moralia, edited by Frederic Diibner.</p>
          <p>Let any reader who wishes to know more about Plutarch, <lb/>
            consult the article on Plutarch, in the Ninth Edition of the <lb/>
            Encyclopaedia Britannica, by the well-known scholar F. A. <lb/>
            Paley. He will also do well to read an Essay on Plutarch <lb/>
            by R. W. Emerson, reprinted in Volume III. of the Bohn's <lb/>
            Standard Library Edition of Emerson's Works, and Five <lb/>
            Lectures on Plutarch by the late Archbishop Trench, pub­ <lb/>
            lished by Messrs. Macmillan and Co. in 1874. All these <lb/>
            contain much of interest, and will repay perusal.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, I hope this little volume will be the means <lb/>
            A making popular some of the best thoughts of one of the <lb/>
            ,nost interesting and thoughtful of the ancients, who often <lb/>
            3eems indeed almost a modern.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>§ I. Come let us consider what one might say on the <lb/>
            education of free children, and by what training they would <lb/>
            become good citizens.</p>
          <p>§ II. It is perhaps best to begin with birth : I would <lb/>
            therefore warn those who desire to be fathers of notable <lb/>
            sons, not to form connections with any kind of women, <lb/>
            such as courtesans or mistresses : for those who either on <lb/>
            the father or mother's side are ill-born have the disgrace <lb/>
            of their origin all their life long irretrievably present with <lb/>
            them, and offer a ready handle to abuse and vituperation. <lb/>
            So that the poet was wise, who said, " Unless the founda­ <lb/>
            tion of a house be well laid, the descendants must of neces­ <lb/>
            sity be unfortunate.”1 Good birth indeed brings with it a <lb/>
            store of assurance, which ought to be greatly valued by <lb/>
            all who desire legitimate offspring. For the spirit of those <lb/>
            who are a spurious and bastard breed is apt to be mean and <lb/>
            abject: for as the poet truly says, " It makes a man even <lb/>
            of noble spirit servile, when he is conscious of the ill fame <lb/>
            of either his father or mother." 2 On the other hand <lb/>
            the sons of illustrious parents are full of pride and arro­ <lb/>
            gance. As an instance of this it is recorded of Diophantus,3 <lb/>
            the son of Themistocles, that he often used to say to various <lb/>
            people " that he could do what he pleased with the Athe­ <lb/>
            nian people, for what he wished his mother wished, and <lb/>
            what she wished Themistocles wished, and what Themis- <note type="footnote"> 1 Euripides, "Here. Fur." 1261, 1262. </note><note type="footnote"> a Euripides, " Hippol.” 424, 425. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Cleophantus is the name given to this lad by other writers. </note> <note type="footnote"> B </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="2"/>
            tocles wished all the Athenians wished." All praise also <lb/>
            ought we to bestow on the Lacedæmonians for their loftiness <lb/>
            of soul in fining their king Archidamns for venturing to <lb/>
            marry a small woman, for they charged him with intending <lb/>
            to furnish them not with kings but kinglets.</p>
          <p>§ III. Next must we mention, what was not overlooked <lb/>
            even by those who handled this subject before us, that <lb/>
            those who approach their wives for procreation must do so <lb/>
            either without having drunk any wine or at least very little. <lb/>
            For those children, that their parents begot in drink, are <lb/>
            wont to be fond of wine and apt to turn out drunkards. <lb/>
            And so Diogenes, seeing a youth out of his mind and <lb/>
            crazy, said, " Young man, your father was drunk when <lb/>
            he begot you." Let this hint serve as to procreation : <lb/>
            now let us discuss education.</p>
          <p>§ IV. To speak generally, what we are wont to say about <lb/>
            the arts and sciences is also true of moral excellence, for to <lb/>
            its perfect development three things must meet together, <lb/>
            natural ability, theory, and practice. By theory I mean <lb/>
            training, and by practice working at one's craft. Now the <lb/>
            foundation must be laid in training, and practice gives <lb/>
            facility, but perfection is attained only by the junction of <lb/>
            all three. For if any one of these elements be wanting, <lb/>
            excellence must be so far deficient. For natural ability with­ <lb/>
            out training is blind : and training without natural ability <lb/>
            is defective, and practice without both natural ability <lb/>
            and training is imperfect. For just as in farming the first <lb/>
            requisite is good soil, next a good farmer, next good seed, <lb/>
            so also here: the soil corresponds to natural ability, the <lb/>
            training to the farmer, the seed to precepts and instruction. <lb/>
            I should therefore maintain stoutly that these three ele­ <lb/>
            ments were found combined in the souls of such universally <lb/>
            famous men as Pythagoras, and Socrates, and Plato, and <lb/>
            of all who have won undying fame. Happy at any rate <lb/>
            and dear to the gods is he to whom any deity has vouch­ <lb/>
            safed all these elements ! But if anyone thinks that those <lb/>
            who have not good natural ability cannot to some extent <lb/>
            make up for the deficiencies of nature by right training <lb/>
            and practice, let such a one know that he is very wide of <lb/>
            the mark, if not out of it altogether. For good natural <lb/>
            parts are impaired by sloth; while inferior ability is <lb/>
             <pb n="3"/>
            mended by training : and while simple things escape the <lb/>
            eyes of the careless, difficult things are reached by pains­ <lb/>
            taking. The wonderful efficacy and power of long and <lb/>
            continuous labour you may see indeed every day in the <lb/>
            world around you.1 Thus water continually dropping <lb/>
            wears away rocks : and iron and steel are moulded by the <lb/>
            hands of the artificer: and chariot wheels bent by some <lb/>
            strain can never recover their original symmetry : and the <lb/>
            crooked staves of actors can never be made straight. But <lb/>
            by toil what is contrary to nature becomes stronger than <lb/>
            even nature itself. And are these the only things that <lb/>
            teach the power of diligence ? Not so: ten thousand <lb/>
            things teach the same truth. A soil naturally good be­ <lb/>
            comes by neglect barren, and the better its original con­ <lb/>
            dition, the worse its ultimate state if uncared for. On the <lb/>
            other hand a soil exceedingly rough and sterile by being <lb/>
            farmed well produces excellent crops. And what trees do <lb/>
            not by neglect become gnarled and unfruitful, whereas by <lb/>
            pruning they become fruitful and productive ? And what <lb/>
            constitution so good but it is marred and impaired by sloth, <lb/>
            luxury, and too full habit ? And what weak constitution <lb/>
            has not derived benefit from exercise and athletics ? And <lb/>
            what horses broken in young are not docile to their riders ? <lb/>
            while if they are not broken in till late they become hard­ <lb/>
            mouthed and unmanageable. And why should we be sur­ <lb/>
            prised at similar cases, seeing that we find many of the <lb/>
            savagest animals docile and tame by training ? Rightly <lb/>
            answered the Thessalian, who was asked who the mildest <lb/>
            Thessalians were, " Those who have done with fighting.”2 <lb/>
            But why pursue the line of argument further ? For the <lb/>
            Greek name for moral virtue is only habit: and if anyone <lb/>
            defines moral virtues as habitual virtues, he will not be beside <lb/>
            the mark. But I will employ only one more illustration, <lb/>
            and dwell no longer on this topic. Lycurgus, the Lace­ <lb/>
            daemonia. legislator, took two puppies of the same parents, <lb/>
            and brought them up in an entirely different way : the one <lb/>
            he pampered and cosseted up, while he taught the other to <lb/>
            hunt and be a retriever. Then on one occasion, when the <note type="footnote"> 1 Compare Sophocles,“ Œdipus Tyrannus," 112, 113. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The Thessalians were very pugnacious. Cf. Isocrates, “ Oratio de <lb/>
            Pace," p. 316. oi <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὲν</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="grc">θετταλοὶ</foreign>) <foreign xml:lang="grc">σφίσιν αὐτοι̃ς ἀεὶ πολεμου̃σιν</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="4"/>
            Lacedæmonians were convened in assembly, he said, <lb/>
            "Mighty, 0 Lacedæmonians, is the influence on moral <lb/>
            excellence of habit, and education, and training, and modes <lb/>
            of life, as I will prove to you at once." So saying he pro­ <lb/>
            duced the two puppies, and set before them a platter and a <lb/>
            hare: the one darted on the hare, while the other made <lb/>
            for the platter. And when the Lacedœmonians could not <lb/>
            guess what his meaning was, or with what intent he had <lb/>
            produced the puppies, he said, " These puppies are of the <lb/>
            same parents, but by virtue of a different bringing up the one <lb/>
            is pampered, and the other a good hound." Let so much <lb/>
            suffice for habit and modes of life.</p>
          <p>§ v. The next point to discuss will be nutrition. In my <lb/>
            opinion mothers ought to nurse and suckle their own chil­ <lb/>
            dren. For they will bring them up with more sympathy <lb/>
            and care, if they love them so intimately and, as the pro­ <lb/>
            verb puts it, "from their first growing their nails.”1 <lb/>
            Whereas the affection of wet or dry nurses is spurious and <lb/>
            counterfeit, being merely for pay. And nature itself teaches <lb/>
            that mothers ought themselves to suckle and rear those <lb/>
            they have given birth to. And for that purpose she has <lb/>
            supplied every female parent with milk. And providence <lb/>
            has wisely provided women with two breasts, so that if they <lb/>
            should bear twins, they would have a breast for each. And <lb/>
            besides this, as is natural enough, they would feel more <lb/>
            affection and love for their children by suckling them. <lb/>
            For this supplying them with food is as it were a tightener <lb/>
            of love, for even the brute creation, if taken away from <lb/>
            their young, pine away, as we constantly see. Mothers <lb/>
            must therefore, as I said, certainly try to suckle their own <lb/>
            children : but if they are unable to do so either through <lb/>
            physical weakness (for this contingency sometimes occurs), <lb/>
            or in haste to have other children, they must select wet <lb/>
            and dry nurses with the greatest care, and not introduce <lb/>
            into their houses any kind of women. First and foremost <lb/>
            they must be Greeks in their habits. For just as it is <lb/>
            necessary immediately after birth to shapen the limbs of <lb/>
            children, so that they may grow straight and not crooked, <lb/>
            so from the beginning must their habits be- carefully <note type="footnote"> 1 A proverbial expression among the ancients for earliest childhood <lb/>
            See Erasmus, " Adagia." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="5"/>
            attended to. For infancy is supple and easily moulded, and <lb/>
            what children learn sinks deeply into their souls while they <lb/>
            are young and tender, whereas everything hard is softened <lb/>
            only with great difficulty. For just as seals are impressed <lb/>
            on soft wax, so instruction leaves its permanent mark on <lb/>
            the minds of those still young. And divine Plato seems to <lb/>
            me to give excellent advice to nurses not to tell their <lb/>
            children any kind of fables, that their souls may not in <lb/>
            the very dawn of existence be full of folly or corruption.1 <lb/>
            Phocylides the poet also seems to give admirable advice <lb/>
            when he says, "We must teach good habits while the <lb/>
            pupil is still a boy."</p>
          <p>§ vi. Attention also must be given to this point, that <lb/>
            the lads that are to wait upon and be with young people <lb/>
            must be first and foremost of good morals, and able to <lb/>
            speak Greek distinctly and idiomatically, that they may not <lb/>
            by contact with foreigners of loose morals contract any of <lb/>
            their viciousness. For as those who are fond of quoting <lb/>
            proverbs say not amiss, " If you live with a lame man, you <lb/>
            will learn to halt.”2</p>
          <p>§ VII. Next, when our boys are old enough to be put into <lb/>
            the hands of tutors,3 great care must be taken that we do <lb/>
            not hand them over to slaves, or foreigners, or flighty per­ <lb/>
            sons. For what happens nowadays in many cases is highly <lb/>
            ridiculous : good slaves are made farmers, or sailors, or <lb/>
            merchants, or stewards, or money-lenders; but if they find <lb/>
            a winebibbing, greedy, and utterly useless slave, to him <lb/>
            parents commit the charge of their sons, whereas the good <lb/>
            tutor ought to be such a one as was Phoenix, the tutor of <lb/>
            Achilles. The point also which I am now going to speak <lb/>
            about is of the utmost importance. The schoolmasters we <lb/>
            ought to select for our boys should be of blameless life, of <lb/>
            pure character, and of great experience. For a good <lb/>
            training is the source and root of gentlemanly behaviour. <lb/>
            And just as farmers prop up their trees, so good school­ <lb/>
            masters prop up the young by good advice and suggestions, <note type="footnote"> 1 Plato, " Republic," ii. p. 429, E. 2 See Erasmus, " Adagia." </note><note type="footnote"> 8 It is difficult to know how to render the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">παιδαγωγὸς</foreign> in English. <lb/>
            He was the slave who took the boy to. school, and generally looked <lb/>
            after him from his seventh year upward. Tutor or governor seems the <lb/>
            best rendering. He had great power over the boy entrusted to him. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="6"/>
            that they may become upright. How one must despise, <lb/>
            therefore, some fathers, who, whether from ignorance or <lb/>
            inexperience, before putting the intended teachers to the <lb/>
            test, commit their sons to the charge of untried and un­ <lb/>
            tested men. If they act so through inexperience it is not <lb/>
            so ridiculous; but it is to the remotest degree absurd when, <lb/>
            though perfectly aware of both the inexperience and worth­ <lb/>
            lessness of some schoolmasters, they yet entrust their sons <lb/>
            to them : some overcome by flattery, others to gratify <lb/>
            friends who solicit their favours ; acting just as if any­ <lb/>
            body ill in body, passing over the experienced physician, <lb/>
            should, to gratify his friend, call him in, and so throw <lb/>
            away his life; or as if to gratify one's friend one should <lb/>
            reject the best pilot and choose him instead. Zeus and all <lb/>
            the gods! can anyone bearing the sacred name of father <lb/>
            put obliging a petitioner before obtaining the best education <lb/>
            for his sons ? Were they not then wise words that the <lb/>
            time-honoured Socrates used to utter, and say that he <lb/>
            would proclaim, if he could, climbing up to the highest <lb/>
            part of the city, " Men, what can you be thinking of, who <lb/>
            move heaven and earth to make money, while you bestow <lb/>
            next to no attention on the sons you are going to leave <lb/>
            that money to ? " 1 I would add to this that such fathers <lb/>
            act very similarly to a person who should be very careful <lb/>
            about his shoe but care nothing about his foot. Many <lb/>
            persons also are so niggardly about their children, and in­ <lb/>
            different to their interests, that for the sake of a paltry <lb/>
            saving, they prefer worthless teachers for their children, <lb/>
            practising a vile economy at the expense of their children's <lb/>
            ignorance. Apropos of this, Aristippus on one occasion <lb/>
            rebuked an empty-headed parent neatly and wittily. For <lb/>
            being asked how much money a parent ought to pay for <lb/>
            his son's education, he answered, " A thousand drachmæ.” <lb/>
            And he replying, " Hercules, what a price ! I could buy a <lb/>
            slave for as much; ” Aristippus answered, “ You shall <lb/>
            have two slaves then, your son and the slave you buy." 2 <lb/>
            And is it not altogether strange that you accustom your <lb/>
            son to take his food in his right hand, and chide him if he <note type="footnote"> 1 Plato, " Clitophon,” p. 255, D. </note><note type="footnote">a Compare Diogenes Laertius, ii. 72. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="7"/>
            offers his left, whereas you care very little about his hearing <lb/>
            good and sound discourses ? I will tell you what happens <lb/>
            to such admirable fathers, when they have educated and <lb/>
            brought up their sons so badly : when the sons grow to <lb/>
            man's estate, they disregard a sober and well-ordered life, <lb/>
            and rush headlong into disorderly and low vices; then at <lb/>
            the last the parents are sorry they have neglected their <lb/>
            education, bemoaning bitterly when it is too late their sons' <lb/>
            debasement. For some of them keep flatterers and para­ <lb/>
            sites in their retinue-an accursed set of wretches, the <lb/>
            defilers and pest of youth; others keep mistresses and <lb/>
            common prostitutes, wanton and costly ; others waste their <lb/>
            money in eating ; others come to grief through dice and <lb/>
            revelling; some even go in for bolder profligacy, being <lb/>
            whoremongers and defilers of the marriage bed,1 who would <lb/>
            madly pursue their darling vice if it cost them their lives. <lb/>
            Had they associated with some philosopher, they would <lb/>
            not have lowered themselves by such practices, but would <lb/>
            have remembered the precept of Diogenes, whose advice <lb/>
            sounds rather low, but is really of excellent moral intent,2 <lb/>
            " Go into a brothel, my lad, that you may see the little <lb/>
            difference between vice and virtue."</p>
          <p>§ VIlI. I say, then, to speak comprehensively (and I <lb/>
            might be justly considered in so saying to speak as an <lb/>
            oracle, not to be delivering a mere precept), that a good <lb/>
            education and sound bringing-up is of the first and middle <lb/>
            and last importance ; and I declare it to be most instru­ <lb/>
            mental and conducive to virtue and happiness. For all <lb/>
            other human blessings compared to this are petty and in­ <lb/>
            significant. For noble birth is a great honour, but it is an <lb/>
            advantage from our forefathers. And wealth is valuable, <lb/>
            but it is the acquisition of fortune, who has often taken it <lb/>
            away from those who had it, and brought it to those who <lb/>
            little expected it; and much wealth is a sort of mark for <lb/>
            villanous slaves and informers to shoot at to fill their own <note type="footnote"> 1 Reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰοιτοφθορου̃ντες</foreign>, the excellent emendation of Wyttenbach. </note><note type="footnote"> a From the heathen standpoint of course, not from the Christian. <lb/>
            Compare the advice of Cato in Horace's “Satires," Book i. Sat. ii. 31- <lb/>
            35. It is a little difficult to know what Diogenes' precept really means. <lb/>
            Is it that vice is universal ? Like Shakespeare’s “ Measure for Measure, ” <lb/>
            Act ii. be. ii. 5. “ All sects, all ages smack of this vice." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="8"/>
            purses; and, what is a most important point, even the <lb/>
            greatest villains have money sometimes. And glory is <lb/>
            noble, but insecure. And beauty is highly desirable, but <lb/>
            shortlived. And health is highly valuable, but soon im­ <lb/>
            paired. And strength is desirable, but illness or age soon <lb/>
            make sad inroads into it. And generally speaking, if any­ <lb/>
            one prides himself on his bodily strength, let him know <lb/>
            that he is deficient in judgment. For how much inferior <lb/>
            is the strength of a man to that of animals, as elephants, <lb/>
            bulls, and lions! But education is of all our advantages <lb/>
            the only one immortal and divine. And two of the most <lb/>
            powerful agencies in man's nature are mind and reason, <lb/>
            And mind governs reason, and reason obeys mind; and <lb/>
            mind is irremovable by fortune, cannot be taken away by in­ <lb/>
            formers, cannot be destroyed by disease, cannot have inroads <lb/>
            made into it by old age., For the mind alone flourishes in <lb/>
            age ; and while time takes away everything else, it adds <lb/>
            wisdom to old age. Even war, that sweeps away every­ <lb/>
            thing else like a winter torrent, cannot take away education. <lb/>
            And Stilpo, the Megarian, seems to me to have made a <lb/>
            memorable answer when Demetrius enslaved Megara and <lb/>
            rased it to the ground. On his asking whether Stilpo had <lb/>
            lost anything, he replied, " Certainly not, for war can <lb/>
            make no havoc of virtue." Corresponding and consonant <lb/>
            to this is the answer of Socrates, who when asked, I think <lb/>
            by Gorgias,1 if he had any conception as to the happiness of <lb/>
            the King of Persia, replied, " I do not know his position in <lb/>
            regard to virtue and education : for happiness lies in these, <lb/>
            and not in adventitious advantages."</p>
          <p>§ ix. And as I advise parents to think nothing more <lb/>
            important than the education of their children, so I main­ <lb/>
            tain that it must be a sound and healthy education, and <lb/>
            that our sons must be kept as far as possible from vulgar <lb/>
            twaddle. For what pleases the vulgar displeases the wise. <lb/>
            I am borne out by the lines of Euripides, " Unskilled am I <lb/>
            in the oratory that pleases the mob; but amongst the few <lb/>
            that are my equals I am reckoned rather wise. For those <lb/>
            who are little thought of by the wise, seem to hit the taste <note type="footnote"> 1 He was asked by Pol us, see Plato, " Gorgias, ” p. 290, F. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="9"/>
            of the vulgar.”1 And I have myself noticed that those <lb/>
            who practise to speak acceptably and to the gratification <lb/>
            of the masses promiscuously, for the most part become <lb/>
            also profligate and lovers of pleasure in their lives. Natu­ <lb/>
            rally enough. For if in giving pleasure to others they <lb/>
            neglect the noble, they would be hardly likely to put the <lb/>
            lofty and sound above a life of luxury and pleasure, and <lb/>
            to prefer moderation to delights. Yet what better advice <lb/>
            could we give our sons than to follow this ? or to what <lb/>
            could we better exhort them to accustom themselves ? For <lb/>
            perfection is only attained by neither speaking nor acting <lb/>
            at random-as the proverb says, Perfection is only attained <lb/>
            by practice.2 Whereas extempore oratory is easy and facile, <lb/>
            mere windbag, having neither beginning nor end. And <lb/>
            besides their other shortcomings extempore speakers fall <lb/>
            into great disproportion and repetition, whereas a well con­ <lb/>
            sidered speech preserves its due proportions. It is re­ <lb/>
            corded by tradition that Pericles, when called on by the <lb/>
            people for a speech, frequently refused on the plea that he <lb/>
            was unprepared. Similarly Demosthenes, his state-rival, <lb/>
            when the Athenians called upon him for his advice, refused <lb/>
            to give it, saying, " I am not prepared." But this you will <lb/>
            say, perhaps, is mere tradition without authority. But in <lb/>
            his speech against Midias he plainly sets forth the utility <lb/>
            of preparation, for he says, " I do not deny, men of Athens, <lb/>
            that I have prepared this speech to the best of my ability: <lb/>
            for I should have been a poor creature if, after suffering so <lb/>
            much at his hands, and even still suffering, I had neglected <lb/>
            how to plead my case." 3 Not that I would altogether <lb/>
            reject extempore oratory, or its use in critical cases, but it <lb/>
            should be used only as one would take medicine.4 Up, <lb/>
            indeed, to man's estate I would have no extempore speak­ <lb/>
            ing, but when anyone's powers of speech are rooted and <lb/>
            grounded, then, as emergencies call for it, I would allow <lb/>
            his words to flow freely. For as those who have been for <lb/>
            a long time in fetters stumble if unloosed, not being able <note type="footnote"> 1 "Hippolytus," 986-989. </note><note type="footnote">a Cf.

             <pb n="10"/>
            to walk from being long used to their fetters, so those who <lb/>
            for a long time have used compression in their words, if <lb/>
            they are suddenly called upon to speak off-hand, retain the <lb/>
            same character of expression. But to let mere lads speak <lb/>
            extempore is to give rise to the acme of foolish talk. A <lb/>
            wretched painter once showed Apelles, they say, a picture, <lb/>
            and said, " I have just done it." Apelles replied, " With­ <lb/>
            out your telling me, I should know it was painted quickly; <lb/>
            I only wonder you haven't painted more such in the time." <lb/>
            As then (for I now return from my digression), I advise <lb/>
            to avoid stilted and bombastic language, so again do I urge <lb/>
            to avoid a finical and petty style of speech ; for tall talk is <lb/>
            unpopular, and petty language makes no impression. And <lb/>
            as the body ought to be not only sound but in good condi­ <lb/>
            tion, so speech ought to be not only not feeble but vigorous. <lb/>
            For a safe mediocrity is indeed praised, but a bold venture­ <lb/>
            someness is also admired. I am also of the same opinion <lb/>
            with regard to the disposition of the soul, which ought to <lb/>
            be neither audacious nor timid and easily dejected: for the <lb/>
            one ends in impudence and the other in servility; but to <lb/>
            keep in all things the mean between extremes is artistic <lb/>
            and proper. And, while I am still on this topic, I wish to <lb/>
            give my opinion, that I regard a monotonous speech first <lb/>
            as no small proof of want of taste, next as likely to gene­ <lb/>
            rate disdain, and certain not to please long. For to harp <lb/>
            on one string is always tiresome and brings satiety; where­ <lb/>
            as variety is pleasant always whether to the ear or eye.</p>
          <p>§ x. Next our freeborn lad ought to go in for a course <lb/>
            of what is called general knowledge, but a smattering of <lb/>
            this will be sufficient, a taste as it were (for perfect know­ <lb/>
            ledge of all subjects would be impossible); but he must <lb/>
            seriously cultivate philosophy. I borrow an illustration <lb/>
            to show my meaning: it is well to sail round many cities, <lb/>
            but advantageous to live in the best. It was a witty re­ <lb/>
            mark of the philosopher Bion,l that, as those suitors who <lb/>
            could not seduce Penelope took up with her maids as a <lb/>
            pis oiler, so those who cannot attain philosophy wear them­ <lb/>
            selves out in useless pursuits. Philosophy, therefore, ought <note type="footnote"> 1 Diogenes Laertius assigns the remark to Aristippus, while Stobæus <lb/>
            fathers it on Aristo. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="11"/>
            to be regarded as the most important branch of study. <lb/>
            For as regards the cure of the body, men have found two <lb/>
            branches, medicine and exercise: the former of which <lb/>
            gives health, and the latter good condition of body; but <lb/>
            philosophy is the only cure for the maladies and disorders <lb/>
            of the soul. For with her as ruler and guide we can know <lb/>
            what is honourable, what is disgraceful; what is just, what <lb/>
            unjust; generally speaking, what is to be sought after, what <lb/>
            to be avoided ; how we ought to behave to the gods, to <lb/>
            parents, to elders, to the laws, to foreigners, to rulers, to <lb/>
            friends, to women, to children, to slaves: viz., that we <lb/>
            ought to worship the gods, honour parents, reverence <lb/>
            elders, obey the laws, submit ourselves to rulers, love our <lb/>
            friends, be chaste in our relations with women, kind to our <lb/>
            children, and not to treat our slaves badly; and, what is of <lb/>
            the greatest importance, to be neither over elated in pros­ <lb/>
            perity nor over depressed in adversity,1 nor to be dissolute in <lb/>
            pleasures, nor fierce and brutish in anger. These I regard <lb/>
            as the principal blessings that philosophy teachesj For to <lb/>
            enjoy prosperity nobly shows a man ; and to enjoy it with­ <lb/>
            out exciting envy shows a moderate man; and to conquer <lb/>
            the passions by reason argues a wise man; and it is not <lb/>
            everybody who can keep his temper in control. And those <lb/>
            who can unite political ability with philosophy I regard as <lb/>
            perfect men, for I take them to attain two of the greatest <lb/>
            blessings, serving the state in a public capacity, and living <lb/>
            the calm and tranquil life of philosophy. For, as there are <lb/>
            three kinds of life, the practical, the contemplative, and <lb/>
            the life of enjoyment, and of these three the one devoted <lb/>
            to enjoyment is a paltry and animal life, and the practical <lb/>
            without philosophy an unlovely and harsh life, and the <lb/>
            contemplative without the practical a useless life, so we <lb/>
            must endeavour with all our power to combine public life <lb/>
            with philosophy as far as circumstances will permit. Such <lb/>
            was the life led by Pericles, by Archytas of Tarentum, by <lb/>
            Dion of Syracuse, by Epaminondas the Theban, one of <lb/>
            whom was a disciple of Plato (viz., Dion). And as to <lb/>
            education, I do not know that I need dwell any more on it. <note type="footnote"> 1 A favourite thought with the ancients. Compare Isocrates, " Ad­ <lb/>
            monitio ad Demonicum," p. IS ; and Aristotle, " Nic. Eth.," iv. a </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="12"/>
            But in addition to what I have said, it is useful, if not neces­ <lb/>
            sary, not to neglect to procure old books, and to make a col­ <lb/>
            lection of them, as is usual in agriculture. For the use of <lb/>
            books is an instrument in education, and it is profitable in <lb/>
            learning to go to the fountain head.</p>
          <p>§ xi. Exercise also ought not to be neglected, but we <lb/>
            ought to send our boys to the master of the gymnasium to <lb/>
            train them duly, partly with a view to carrying the body <lb/>
            well, partly with a view to strength. For good habit of <lb/>
            body in boys is the foundation of a good old age. For <lb/>
            as in fine weather we ought to lay up for winter, so in <lb/>
            youth one ought to form good habits and live soberly so. <lb/>
            as to have a reserve stock of strength for old age. Yet <lb/>
            ought we to husband the exertions of the body, so as not <lb/>
            to be wearied out by them and rendered unfit for study. <lb/>
            For, as Plato says,1 excessive sleep and fatigue are enemies <lb/>
            to learning. But why dwell on this ? For I am in a hurry <lb/>
            to pass to the most important point. Our lads must be <lb/>
            trained for warlike encounters, making themselves efficient <lb/>
            in hurling the javelin and darts, and in the chase. For. <lb/>
            the possessions of those who are defeated in battle belong <lb/>
            to the conquerors as booty of war; and war is not the place­ <lb/>
            for delicately brought up bodies: it is the spare warrior <lb/>
            that makes the best combatant, who as an athlete cuts his <lb/>
            way through the ranks of the enemies. Supposing anyone <lb/>
            objects : " How so ? As you undertook to give advice <lb/>
            on the education of freeborn children, do you now neglect <lb/>
            the poor and plebeian ones, and give instructions only suit­ <lb/>
            able to the rich ? " It is easy enough to meet such critics. <lb/>
            I should prefer to make my teaching general and suitable <lb/>
            to all; but if any, through their poverty, shall be unable to <lb/>
            follow up my precepts, let them blame fortune, and not the <lb/>
            author of these hints. We must try with all our might to <lb/>
            procure the best education for the poor as well as the rich, <lb/>
            but if that is impossible, then we must put up with the <lb/>
            practicable. I inserted those matters into my discourse <lb/>
            here, that I might hereafter confine myself to all that <lb/>
            appertains to the right education of the young.</p>
          <p>§ XII. And this I say that we ought to try to draw our <lb/>
            boys to good pursuits by entreaties and exhortation, but <note type="footnote"> 1 “ Republic,” vii. p. 489, E. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="13"/>
            certainly not by blows or abusive language. For that seems <lb/>
            to be more fitting for slaves than the freeborn. For slaves <lb/>
            try to shirk and avoid their work, partly because of the <lb/>
            pain of blows, partly on account of being reviled. But <lb/>
            praise or censure are far more useful than abuse to the <lb/>
            freeborn, praise pricking them on to virtue, censure deter­ <lb/>
            ring them from vice. But one must censure and praise <lb/>
            alternately: when they are too saucy we must censure <lb/>
            them and make them ashamed of themselves, and again <lb/>
            encourage them by praise, and imitate those nurses who, <lb/>
            when their children sob, give them the breast to comfort <lb/>
            them. But we must not puff them up and make them con­ <lb/>
            ceited with excessive praise, for that will make them vain <lb/>
            and give themselves airs.</p>
          <p>§ XIII. And I have ere now seen some fathers, whose ex­ <lb/>
            cessive love for their children has turned into hatred. My <lb/>
            meaning I will endeavour to make clearer by illustration. <lb/>
            While they are in too great a hurry to make their sons take <lb/>
            the lead in everything, they lay too much work upon them, <lb/>
            so that they faint under their tasks, and, being overbur­ <lb/>
            dened, are disinclined for learning. For just as plants <lb/>
            grow with moderate rain, but are done for by too much <lb/>
            rain, so the mind enlarges by a proper amount of work, <lb/>
            but by too much is unhinged. We must therefore give <lb/>
            our boys remission from continuous labour, bearing in <lb/>
            mind that all our life is divided into labour and rest; <lb/>
            thus we find not only wakefulness but sleep, not only war <lb/>
            but peace, not only foul weather but fine also, not only <lb/>
            working days but also festivals. And, to speak concisely, <lb/>
            rest is the sauce of labour. And we can see this not only <lb/>
            in the case of animate, but even inanimate things, for we <lb/>
            make bows and lyres slack that we may be able to stretch <lb/>
            them. And, generally the body is preserved by repletion <lb/>
            and evacuation, and the soul by rest and work. We ought <lb/>
            also to censure some fathers who, after entrusting their <lb/>
            sons to tutors and preceptors, neither see nor hear how the <lb/>
            teaching is done. This is a great mistake. For they ought <lb/>
            after a few days to test the progress of their sons, and not <lb/>
            to base their hopes on the behaviour of a hireling; and the <lb/>
            preceptors will take all the more pains with the boys, if they <lb/>
            have from time to time to give an account of their progress. <lb/>
             <pb n="14"/>
            Hence the propriety of that remark of the groom, that <lb/>
            nothing fats the horse so much as the king's eye.1 And <lb/>
            especial attention, in my opinion, must be paid to cultivat­ <lb/>
            ing and exercising the memory of boys, for memory is, as <lb/>
            it were, the storehouse of learning ; and that was why they <lb/>
            fabled Mnemosyne to be the mother of the Muses, hinting <lb/>
            and insinuating that nothing so generates and contributes <lb/>
            to the growth of learning as memory. And therefore the <lb/>
            memory must be cultivated, whether boys have a good one <lb/>
            by nature, or a bad one. For we shall so add to natural <lb/>
            good parts, and make up somewhat for natural deficiencies, <lb/>
            so that the deficient will be better than others, and the <lb/>
            clever will outstrip themselves. For good is that remark <lb/>
            of Hesiod, " If to a little you keep adding a little, and do <lb/>
            so frequently, it will soon be a lot.”2 And let not fathers <lb/>
            forget, that thus cultivating the memory is not only good <lb/>
            for education, but is also a great aid in the business of life. <lb/>
            For the remembrance of past actions gives a good model <lb/>
            how to deal wisely in future ones.</p>
          <p>§ xiv. We must also keep our sons from filthy language. <lb/>
            For, as Democritus says, Language is the shadow of action. <lb/>
            They must also be taught to be affable and courteous. For as <lb/>
            want of affability is justly hateful, so boys will not be dis­ <lb/>
            agreeable to those they associate with, if they yield occa­ <lb/>
            sionally in disputes. For it is not only excellent to know <lb/>
            how to conquer, but also to know how to be defeated, when <lb/>
            victory would be injurious, for there is such a thing as a <lb/>
            Cadmean victory.3 I can cite wise Euripides as a witness <lb/>
            of the truth of what I say, who says, " When two are talk­ <lb/>
            ing, and one of them is in a passion, he is the wiser who <lb/>
            first gives way.”4</p>
          <p>I will next state something quite as important, in­ <lb/>
            deed, if anything, even more important. That is, that <lb/>
            life must be spent without luxury, the tongue must be <note type="footnote"> 1 A famous Proverb. It is " the master's eye" generally, as in <lb/>
            Xenophon, " Œconom.” xii. 20 ; and Aristotle, “ CEconom." i. 6. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 “ Works and Days," 361, 362. The lines were favourite ones with <lb/>
            our author. He quotes them again, § 3, of " How one may be aware of <lb/>
            one's Progress in Virtue." </note><note type="footnote"> 8 See Pausanias, ix. 9. Also Erasmus, “ Adagia." </note><note type="footnote"> 4 A fragment from the “ Protesilaus " of Euripides. Our " It takes <lb/>
            two to make a quarrel." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="15"/>
            under control, so must the temper and the hands. All <lb/>
            this is of extreme importance, as I will show by examples. <lb/>
            To begin with the last case, some who have put their hands <lb/>
            to unjust gains, have lost all the fruits of their former life, <lb/>
            as the Lacedæmonian Gylippus,1 who was exiled from <lb/>
            Sparta for embezzling the public money. [To be able to <lb/>
            govern the temper also argues a wise man.] For Socrates, <lb/>
            when a very impudent and disgusting young fellow kicked <lb/>
            him on one occasion, seeing all the rest of his class vexed <lb/>
            and impatient, even to the point of wanting to prosecute <lb/>
            the young man, said, " What! If a young ass kicked me <lb/>
            would you have me kick it back ? " Not that the young <lb/>
            fellow committed this outrage on Socrates with impunity, <lb/>
            for as all reviled him and nicknamed him the kicker, he <lb/>
            hung himself. And when Aristophanes brought his <lb/>
            " Clouds" on the stage, and bespattered Socrates with his <lb/>
            gibes and flouts, and one of the spectators said, " Aren't <lb/>
            you vexed, Socrates, at his exhibiting you on the stage in <lb/>
            this comic light ? " he answered, " Not I, by Zeus, for I <lb/>
            look upon the theatre as only a large supper party.”2 <lb/>
            Very similar to this was the behaviour of Archytas of <lb/>
            Tarentum and Plato. The former, on his return from <lb/>
            war, where he had been general, finding his land neglected, <lb/>
            called his bailiff, and said to him, " You would have caught <lb/>
            it, had I not been very angry." And Plato, very angry with a <lb/>
            gluttonous and shameless slave, called his sister's son <lb/>
            Speusippus, and said, " Go and beat him, for I am too <lb/>
            angry." But someone will say, these examples are diffi­ <lb/>
            cult and hard to follow. I know it. But we must try, as <lb/>
            far as possible, following these examples, to avoid un­ <lb/>
            governable and mad rage. For we cannot in other respects <lb/>
            equal those distinguished men in their ability and virtue, <lb/>
            nevertheless we must, like initiating priests of the gods <lb/>
            and torchbearers of wisdom, attempt as far as possible <lb/>
            to imitate and nibble at their practice. Then, again, if <lb/>
            anyone thinks it a small and unimportant matter to govern <lb/>
            the tongue, another point I promised to touch on, he is <lb/>
            very far from the reality. For silence at the proper season <lb/>
            is wisdom, and better than any speech. And that is, I <note type="footnote"> 1 See Plutarch's Lysander. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Or symposium, where all sorts of liberties were taken. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="16"/>
            think, the reason why the ancients instituted the mysteries <lb/>
            that we, learning therein to be silent, might transfer oar <lb/>
            secrecy to the gods to human affairs. And no one ever <lb/>
            yet repented of his silence, while multitudes have repented <lb/>
            of their speaking. And what has not been said is easy to <lb/>
            say, while what has been once said can never be recalled. <lb/>
            1 have heard of myriads who have fallen into the greatest <lb/>
            misfortunes through inability to govern their tongues. <lb/>
            Passing over the rest, I will mention one or two cases in <lb/>
            point. When Ptolemy Philadelphus married his sister <lb/>
            Arsinoe, Sotades said, “ You are contracting an unholy <lb/>
            marriage.”1 For this speech be long lingered in prison, <lb/>
            and paid the righteous penalty for his unseasonable bab­ <lb/>
            bling, and had to weep a long time for making others <lb/>
            laugh. Theocritus the Sophist similarly cracked his jokes, <lb/>
            and had to pay even a greater penalty. For when Alex­ <lb/>
            ander ordered the Greeks to furnish him with purple robes <lb/>
            to wear at the sacrifices on his triumphal return from war <lb/>
            against the barbarians, and his subjects contributed so <lb/>
            much per head, Theocritus said, " Before I doubted, but now <lb/>
            I am sure, that this is the purple death Homer speaks of.”2 <lb/>
            By this speech he made Alexander his enemy. The same <lb/>
            Theocritus put Antigonus, the King of the Macedonians, a <lb/>
            one-eyed man, into a thundering rage by alluding to his <lb/>
            misfortune. For the King sent his chief cook, Eutropio, <lb/>
            an important person at his court, to go and fetch Theo­ <lb/>
            critus before him to confer with him, and when he had fre­ <lb/>
            quently requested him to come without avail, Theocritus <lb/>
            at last said, " I know well you wish to serve me up raw <lb/>
            to the Cyclops ; " flouting the King as one-eyed and the <lb/>
            cook with his profession. Eutropio replied, " You shall <lb/>
            lose your head, and pay the penalty for this babbling and <lb/>
            mad insolence ;” and reported his words to the King, who <lb/>
            sent and had his head taken off. Our boys must also be <lb/>
            taught to speak the truth as a most sacred duty; for to lie <lb/>
            is servile, and most hateful in all men, hardly to be par­ <lb/>
            doned even in poor slaves.</p>
          <p>§ xv. Thus much have I said about the good conduct <note type="footnote"> 1 I have softened his phrase. His actual words were very coarse, <lb/>
            and would naturally be resented by Ptolemy. See Athenaeus, 621, A. </note><note type="footnote"> a See " Iliad," v. 83 ; xvi. 334 ; xx. 477. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="17"/>
            and self-control of boys without any doubt or hesitation : <lb/>
            but as to what I am now going to say I am doubtful and <lb/>
            undecided, and like a person weighed in the scales against <lb/>
            exactly his weight, and feel great hesitation as to whether <lb/>
            I should recommend or dissuade the practice. But I must <lb/>
            speak out. The question is this-whether we ought to let <lb/>
            the lovers of our boys associate and be with them, or on <lb/>
            the contrary, debar them from their company and scare <lb/>
            them off. For when I look at fathers self-opinionated <lb/>
            sour and austere, who think their sons having lovers a dis­ <lb/>
            grace not to be borne, I am rather afraid of recommending <lb/>
            the practice. But when, on the other hand, I think of <lb/>
            Socrates, Xenophon, AEschines, Cebes, and all the com­ <lb/>
            pany of those men who have approved of male loves, and <lb/>
            who have introduced their minions to learning, to high <lb/>
            positions in the State, and to good morals, I change my <lb/>
            opinion, and am moved to emulate those men. And <lb/>
            Euripides seems to favour these views in the passage, " But <lb/>
            there is among mortals another love, that of the righteous <lb/>
            temperate and pure soul.”1 Nor must we omit the re­ <lb/>
            mark of Plato, which seems to mix seriousness with mirth, <lb/>
            that " those who have distinguished themselves ought to <lb/>
            be permitted to kiss any handsome boy they like.”2 Those <lb/>
            then that seek only carnal enjoyment must be kept off, but <lb/>
            those that love the soul must be encouraged. And while <lb/>
            the loves common at Thebes and Elis, and the so-called <lb/>
            rape at Crete, must be avoided, the loves of Athens and <lb/>
            Lacedæmon should be emulated.</p>
          <p>§ xvi. As to this matter, therefore, let every parent <lb/>
            follow his inclination. And now, as I have spoken about <lb/>
            the good and decent behaviour of boys, I shall change my <lb/>
            subject and speak a little about youths. For I have often <lb/>
            censured the introducers of bad habits, who have set over <lb/>
            boys tutors and preceptors, but have given to youths full <lb/>
            liberty, when they ought, on the contrary, to have watched <lb/>
            and guarded them more than boys. For who does not <lb/>
            know that the offences of boys are petty and easily cured, <lb/>
            and proceed from the carelessness of tutors or want of <note type="footnote"> 1 A fragment from the “ Dictys " of Euripides. </note><note type="footnote">a " Republ." v. 463, F. sq. </note> <note type="footnote"> <unclear>C</unclear> </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="18"/>
            obedience to preceptors; but the faults of young men are <lb/>
            often grave and serious, as gluttony, and robbing their <lb/>
            fathers, and dice, and revellings, and drinking-bouts, and <lb/>
            deflowering of maidens, and seducing of married women. <lb/>
            Such outbreaks ought to be carefully checked and curbed. <lb/>
            For that prime of life is prodigal in pleasure, and frisky, <lb/>
            and needs a bridle, so that those parents who do not <lb/>
            strongly check that period, are foolishly, if unawares, giv­ <lb/>
            ing their youths license for vice.1 Sensible parents, there­ <lb/>
            fore, ought during all that period to guard and watch and <lb/>
            restrain their youths, by precepts, by threats, by entreaties, <lb/>
            by advice, by promises, by citing examples,2 on the one <lb/>
            hand, of those who have come to ruin by being too fond of <lb/>
            pleasure, on the other hand, of those who by their self- <lb/>
            control have attained to praise and good report. For these <lb/>
            arc, as it were, the two elements of virtue, hope of honour, <lb/>
            and fear of punishment; the former inciting to good prac­ <lb/>
            tices, the latter deterring from bad.</p>
          <p>§ xvii. We ought, at all hazards, to keep our boys also <lb/>
            from association with bad men, for they will catch some of <lb/>
            their villany. This was the meaning of Pythagoras' enig­ <lb/>
            matical precepts, which I shall quote and explain, as they <lb/>
            give no slight momentum towards the acquisition of virtue: <lb/>
            as, Do not touch black tails: that is, do not associate with <lb/>
            bad men.3 Do not go beyond the balance: that is, we must <lb/>
            pay the greatest attention to justice and not go beyond it. <lb/>
            Do not sit on a measure: that is, do not be lazy, but earn <lb/>
            to-morrow's bread as well as to-day's. Do not give everyone <lb/>
            your right hand: that is, do not be too ready to strike up a <lb/>
            friendship. Do not wear a tight ring : that is, let your life <lb/>
            be free, do not bind yourself by a chain. Do not poke the <lb/>
            fire with a sword: that is, do not provoke an angry person, <lb/>
            but yield to such. Do not eat the heart: do not wear away <lb/>
            the heart by anxiety. Abstain from beans: that is, do not <lb/>
            meddle in state affairs, for the voting for offices was <lb/>
            formerly taken by beans. Do not put your food in the <lb/>
            chamber-pot: that is, do not throw your pearls before swine, <lb/>
            for words are the food of the mind, and the villany of men <note type="footnote"> 1 Cf.

            twist them to a corrupt meaning. When you have come to <lb/>
            the end of a journey do not look back : that is, when people <lb/>
            are going to die and see that their end is near, they ought to <lb/>
            take it easily and not be dejected. But I will return from <lb/>
            my digression. We must keep our boys, as I said, from <lb/>
            association with all bad men, but especially from flatterers. <lb/>
            For, as I have often said to parents, and still say, and will <lb/>
            constantly affirm, there is no race more pestilential, nor <lb/>
            more sure to ruin youths swiftly, than the race of flatterers, <lb/>
            who destroy both parents and sons root and branch, <lb/>
            making the old age of the one and the youth of the others <lb/>
            miserable, holding out pleasure as a sure bait. The sons <lb/>
            of the rich are by their fathers urged to be sober, but by <lb/>
            them to be drunk; by their fathers to be chaste, by them <lb/>
            to wax wanton; by their fathers to save, by them to spend; <lb/>
            by their fathers to be industrious, by them to be lazy. For <lb/>
            they say, “‘ Our life's but a span ;’1 we can only live once; <lb/>
            why should you heed your father's threats ? he's an old <lb/>
            twaddler, he has one foot in the grave ; we shall soon hoist <lb/>
            him up and carry him off to burial." Some even pimp for <lb/>
            them and supply them with prostitutes or even married <lb/>
            women, and cut huge slices off the father's savings for old <lb/>
            age, if they don't run off with them altogether. An <lb/>
            accursed tribe, feigning friendship, knowing nothing of real <lb/>
            freedom, flatterers of the rich, despisers of the poor, drawn <lb/>
            to young men by a sort of natural logic,2 showing their <lb/>
            teeth and grinning all over when their patrons laugh,3 <lb/>
            misbegotten brats of fortune and bastard elements in life, <lb/>
            living according to the nod of the rich, free in their cir­ <lb/>
            cumstances, but slaves by inclination, when they are not <lb/>
            insulted thinking themselves insulted, because they are <lb/>
            parasites to no purpose. So, if any father cares for the <lb/>
            good bringing-up of his sons, he must banish from his <lb/>
            house this abominable race. He must also be on his guard <lb/>
            against the viciousness of his sons' schoolfellows, for they <lb/>
            are quite sufficient to corrupt the best morals.</p>
          <p>§ XVIII. What I have said hitherto is apropos to my <note type="footnote"> 1 From Simonides. Cf. Seneca, " Epist." xlix. " Punctum est quod <lb/>

            subject: I will now speak a word to the men. Parents <lb/>
            must not be over harsh and rough in their natures, but <lb/>
            must often forgive their sons' offences, remembering that <lb/>
            they themselves were once young. And just as doctors by <lb/>
            infusing a sweet flavour into their bitter potions find <lb/>
            delight a passage to benefit, so fathers must temper the <lb/>
            severity of their censure by mildness; and sometimes relax <lb/>
            and slacken the reins of their sons' desires, and again <lb/>
            tighten them; and must be especially easy in respect to <lb/>
            their faults, or if they are angry must soon cool down. <lb/>
            For it is better for a father to be hot-tempered than sullen, <lb/>
            for to continue hostile and irreconcilable looks like hating <lb/>
            one's son. And it is good to seem not to notice some <lb/>
            faults, but to extend to them the weak sight and deafness <lb/>
            of old age, so as seeing not to see, and hearing not to hear, <lb/>
            their doings. We tolerate the faults of our friends; why <lb/>
            should we not that of our sons ? often even our slaves' <lb/>
            drunken debauches we do not expose. Have you been <lb/>
            rather near ? spend more freely. Have you been vexed ? <lb/>
            let the matter pass. Has your son deceived you by the <lb/>
            help of a slave ? do not be angry. Did he take a yoke of <lb/>
            oxen from the field, did he come home smelling of yes­ <lb/>
            terday's debauch ? wink at it. Is he scented like a perfume <lb/>
            shop ? say nothing. Thus frisky youth gets broken in.1</p>
          <p>§ xix. Those of our sons who are given to pleasure and <lb/>
            pay little heed to rebuke, we must endeavour to marry, <lb/>
            for marriage is the surest restraint upon youth. And we <lb/>
            must marry our sons to wives not much richer or better <lb/>
            born, for the proverb is a sound one, " Marry in your own <lb/>
            walk of life.”2 For those who marry wives superior to <lb/>
            themselves in rank are not so much the husbands of their <lb/>
            wives as unawares slaves to their dowries.3</p>
          <p>§ xx. I shall add a few remarks, and then bring my <lb/>
            subject to a close. Before all things fathers must, by a <lb/>
            good behaviour, set a good example to their sons, that, <lb/>
            looking at their lives as a mirror, they may turn away from <note type="footnote"> 1 Compare the character of Micio in the " Adelphi " of Terence. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This saying is assigned by Diogenes Laertius to Pittacus. </note><note type="footnote"> a Compare Plautus, " Asinaria," i. 1. 74. “ Argentum accepi: dote <lb/>
            imperium vendidi." Compare also our author, " Whether Vice is suffi­ <lb/>
            cient to cause Unhappiness," § i. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="21"/>
            bad deeds and words. For those fathers who censure their <lb/>
            sons' faults while they themselves commit the same, are <lb/>
            really their own accusers, if they know it not, under their <lb/>
            sons' name; and those who live a depraved life have no <lb/>
            right to censure their slaves, far less their sons. And <unclear/> <lb/>
            resides this they will become counsellors and teachers of <lb/>
            heir sons in wrongdoing ; for where old men are shameless <lb/>
            ouths will of a certainty have no modesty. We must <lb/>
            therefore take all pains to teach our sons self-control, <lb/>
            emulating the conduct of Eurydice, who, though an <lb/>
            Illyrian and more than a barbarian, to teach her sons <lb/>
            educated herself though late in life, and her love to them <lb/>
            is well depicted in the inscription which she offered to <lb/>
            the Muses: " Eurydice of Hierapolis made this offering to <lb/>
            the Muses, having conceived a vast love for knowledge. <lb/>
            For when a mother with sons full-grown she learnt letters, <lb/>
            the preservers of knowledge."</p>
          <p>To carry out all these precepts would be perhaps a <lb/>
            visionary scheme; but to attain to many, though it would <lb/>
            need a happy disposition and much care, is a thing possible <lb/>
            to human nature.1</p>

          <p>§ I. Appeals to foreign law-courts were first devised <lb/>
            among the Greeks through mistrust of one another's justice, <lb/>
            for they looked on justice as a necessity not indigenous <lb/>
            among them. Is it not on much the same principle that <lb/>
            the philosophers, in regard to some of their questions, <lb/>
            owing to their variety of opinion, have appealed to the <lb/>
            brute creation as to a strange state, and submitted the <lb/>
            decision to their instincts and habits as not to be talked over <note type="footnote"> 1 Wyttenbach thinks this treatise is not Plutarch's. He bases his <lb/>
            conclusion partly on external, partly on internal, grounds. It is not <lb/>
            quoted by Stobæus, or any of the ancients, before the fourteenth <lb/>
            century. And its style is not Plutarch's; it has many words foreign <lb/>
            to Plutarch: it has "nescio quid novum ac peregrinum, ab ilia <lb/>
            Plutarchea copia et gravitate diversum leve et inane." Certainly its <lb/>
            matter is superior to its manner. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="22"/>
            and impartial ? Or is it a general charge against human in­ <lb/>
            firmity that, having different opinions on the most necessary <lb/>
            and important things, we seek in horses and dogs and birds <lb/>
            how to marry and beget and rear children, as though we <lb/>
            had no means of making our own nature known, and appeal <lb/>
            to the habits and instincts of the brute creation, and call <lb/>
            them in to bear witness against the many deviations from <lb/>
            nature in onr lives, which from the first are confused and <lb/>
            disorderly. For among the brutes nature remains ever <lb/>
            the same, pure and simple, but in men, owing to reason <lb/>
            and habit, like oil in the hands of the perfumers, being <lb/>
            mixed up with many added opinions, it becomes various <lb/>
            and loses its original simplicity. And let us not wonder <lb/>
            that the brutes follow nature more closely than human <lb/>
            beings, for in that respect even they are outstripped by <lb/>
            inanimate things, which, being dowered neither with imagi­ <lb/>
            nation nor any appetite or inclination contrary to nature, <lb/>
            ever continue in the one path which nature has prescribed <lb/>
            for them, as if they were tied and bound. But in brutes <lb/>
            the gentleness of mood inspired by reason, the subtlety, <lb/>
            the love of freedom, are not qualities found in excess, but <lb/>
            they have unreasonable appetites and desires, and act in a <lb/>
            roundabout way within certain limits, riding, as it were, <lb/>
            at the anchor of nature, and only going straight under bit <lb/>
            and bridle. But in man reason, which is absolute master, <lb/>
            inventing different modes and fashions of life, has left no <lb/>
            plain or evident trace of nature.1</p>
          <p>§ II. Consider in their marriages how much the animals <lb/>
            follow nature. For they do not wait for any legislation <lb/>
            about bachelor or late-married, like the citizens of Lycurgus <lb/>
            and Solon, nor do they fear penalties for childlessness, nor <lb/>
            are they anxious for the jus trium Uberorum,2 like many of <lb/>
            the Romans, who only marry and have children for the <lb/>
            privileges it bestows, not to have heirs, but to be qualified <lb/>
            for succeeding themselves to inheritances. Then, again, <note type="footnote"> 1 Much of this is very corrupt in the Greek. I have tried to get the <lb/>
            best sense I could; but it is very obscure. Certainly Plutarch's style <lb/>
            is often very harsh and crabbed. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The jus trium liberorum assigned certain privileges to the father of <lb/>
            three children, under the Roman Emperors. Frequent allusions are <lb/>
            made to this law by the ancient writers. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="23"/>
            the male animal does not go with the female at all times; <lb/>
            for its aim is not pleasure but procreation: so in the season <lb/>
            of spring, the most appropriate time for such pairings,1 the <lb/>
            female being submissive and tender attracts the male by <lb/>
            her beautiful condition of body, coming as she does from <lb/>
            the dew and fresh pastures, and when pregnant modestly <lb/>
            retires and takes thought for the birth and safety of her <lb/>
            offspring. We cannot adequately describe all this, but every <lb/>
            animal exhibits for its young affection and forethought <lb/>
            and endurance and unselfishness. We call the bee wise, and <lb/>
            celebrate its " making the yellow honey,"2 flattering it for its <lb/>
            tickling sweetness; but we neglect the wisdom and in­ <lb/>
            genuity of other creatures, both as regards the birth and <lb/>
            bringing up of their young. For example, the kingfi slier after <lb/>
            conception weaves its nest with the thorns of the marine <lb/>
            needle, making it round and oblong in shape like a fisher­ <lb/>
            man's basket, and after deftly and closely weaving it <lb/>
            together, subjects it to the action of the sea waves, that its <lb/>
            surface may be rendered waterproof by this plash and <lb/>
            cement, and it is hard for even iron or stone to break it. <lb/>
            And what is more wonderful still, so symmetrically is the <lb/>
            entrance of the nest adjusted to the kingfisher's shape and <lb/>
            size, that no beast either greater or smaller can enter <lb/>
            it, they even say that it does not admit the sea, or even the <lb/>
            very smallest things. And cats, when they breed, very <lb/>
            often let their kittens go out and feed, and take them back <lb/>
            into their entrails again.3 And the bear, a most savage <lb/>
            and ugly beast, gives birth to its young without shape or <lb/>
            joints, and with its tongue as with an instrument moulds <lb/>
            its features, so that it seems to give form as well as life <lb/>
            to its progeny. And the lion in Homer, “ whom the <lb/>
            hunters meet in the wood with its whelps, exulting in its <lb/>
            strength, which so frowns that it hides its eyes,”4 does it <lb/>
            not intend to bargain with the hunters for its whelps ? For <lb/>
            universally the love of animals for their offspring makes <lb/>
            timid ones bold, and lazy ones energetic, and greedy ones <note type="footnote"> 1 Compare Lucretius, i. 10-20. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 A quotation from Simonides. </note><note type="footnote"> a We are not bound to swallow all the ancients tell us. Credat <lb/>

             <pb n="24"/>
            unselfish. And so the bird in Homer, feeding its young <lb/>
            " with its beak, with whatever it has captured, even though <lb/>
            it goes ill with itself,”1 nourishes its young at the cost <lb/>
            of its own hunger, and when the food is near its maw <lb/>
            abstains from it, and holds it tightly in its mouth, that it <lb/>
            may not gulp it down unawares. "And so a bitch be­ <lb/>
            striding her tender pups, barks at a strange man, and <lb/>
            yearns for the fray,”2 making her fear for them a sort of <lb/>
            second anger. And partridges when they are pursued <lb/>
            with their young let them By on, and, contriving their <lb/>
            safety, themselves fly so near the sportsmen as to be almost <lb/>
            caught, and then wheel round, and again fly back and make <lb/>
            the sportsmen hope to catch them, till at last, having thus <lb/>
            provided for the safety of their young, they lead the sports­ <lb/>
            men on a long way. As to hens, we see every day how they <lb/>
            watch over their chicks, dropping their wings over some, <lb/>
            and letting others climb on their backs, or anywhere about <lb/>
            them, and clucking for joy all the time: and though they <lb/>
            fly from dogs and dragons when only afraid for themselves, <lb/>
            if they are afraid for their chicks they stand their ground <lb/>
            and fight valiantly. Are we to suppose then that nature <lb/>
            has only implanted these instincts in fowls and dogs and <lb/>
            bears, anxious only about their offspring, to put us mortals <lb/>
            out of countenance and to give us a bad name ? considering <lb/>
            these examples for us to follow, while disgrace justly <lb/>
            attaches to our inhumanity, for mankind only is accused <lb/>
            of having no disinterested affection, and of not knowing how <lb/>
            to love except in regard to advantage. For that line is <lb/>
            greatly admired in the theatres, " Man loves man only for <lb/>
            reward," and is the view of Epicurus, who thinks that <lb/>
            the father so loves his son, the mother her child, children <lb/>
            their parents. Whereas, if the brutes could understand <lb/>
            conversation, and if anyone were to introduce horses and <lb/>
            cows and dogs and birds into a common theatre,3 and <lb/>
            were to change the sentiment into " neither do dogs love <lb/>
            their pups, nor horses their foals, nor birds their young, out <note type="footnote"> 1 “Iliad,” ix. 324. Quoted again in " How one may be aware of one's <lb/>

            of interest, but gratuitously and by nature," it would be <lb/>
            recognized by the affections of all of them to be a true <lb/>
            sentiment. Why it would be disgraceful, great God, that <lb/>
            birth and travail and procreation should be gratis and <lb/>
            mere nature among the beasts, while among mankind they <lb/>
            should be merely mercenary transactions!</p>
          <p>§ in. But such a statement is not true or worthy of <lb/>
            credit. For as nature, in wild growths, such as wild vines, <lb/>
            wild figs, or wild olives, makes the fruit imperfect and <lb/>
            inferior to the fruit of cultivated trees, so has she given to <lb/>
            the brutes an imperfect affection for their kind, one neither <lb/>
            marked by justice nor going beyond commodity : whereas <lb/>
            to man, a logical and social animal, she has taught justice <lb/>
            and law, and honour to the gods, and building of cities, <lb/>
            and philanthropy, and has contributed the noble and goodly <lb/>
            and fruitful seeds of all these in love to one's offspring, <lb/>
            thereby following the very first elements that are found in <lb/>
            the construction of the body. For nature is everywhere <lb/>
            perfect and artistic and complete, and, to borrow the ex­ <lb/>
            pression of Erasistratus, has nothing tawdry about her: <lb/>
            but one cannot adequately describe all the processes apper­ <lb/>
            taining to birth, nor would it be perhaps decent to pry too <lb/>
            closely into such hidden matters, and to particularize too <lb/>
            minutely all their wondrous ingenuity. But her contrivance <lb/>
            and dispensation of milk alone is sufficient to prove nature's <lb/>
            wonderful care and forethought. For all the superfluous <lb/>
            blood in women, that owing to their languor and thinness <lb/>
            of spirit floats about on the surface and oppresses them, <lb/>
            has a safety-valve provided by nature in the menses, which <lb/>
            relieve and cleanse the rest of the body, and fit the womb <lb/>
            for conception in due season. But after conception nature <lb/>
            stops the menses, and arrests the flow of the blood, using <lb/>
            it as aliment for the babe in the womb, until the time <lb/>
            arrives for its birth, and it requires a different kind of food. <lb/>
            At this stage the blood is most ingeniously changed into a <lb/>
            supply of milk, not diffused all over the body, but externally <lb/>
            in the breasts, so that the babe can with its mouth imbibe <lb/>
            the gentle and soothing nutriment.1 But all these various <note type="footnote"> 1 All that is said here about the milk, the menses, and the blood, I <lb/>
            have been obliged somewhat to condense and paraphrase. The ancients </note> <lb/>

            processes of nature, all this economy, all this forethought, <lb/>
            would be useless, had not nature also implanted in mothers <lb/>
            love to their offspring and anxiety for their welfare. <lb/>
            " For of all things, that on the earth do breathe <lb/>
            Or creep, man is by far the wretchedest." 1 <lb/>
            And the poet's words are especially applicable to a new­ <lb/>
            born babe. For there is nothing so imperfect, so helpless, <lb/>
            so naked, so shapeless, so foul as a newborn babe: to whom <lb/>
            almost alone nature has given an impure outlet to the light <lb/>
            of day : being kneaded with blood, and full of defilement, <lb/>
            and like one killed rather than born : which no one would <lb/>
            touch, or lift up, or kiss, or embrace, but from natural <lb/>
            affection. And that is why all the animals have their <lb/>
            udders under the belly, women alone have their breasts <lb/>
            high on their bodies, that they can lift up their babes to <lb/>
            kiss, to dandle, and to fondle : seeing that their bearing <lb/>
            and rearing children comes not from necessity but love.</p>
          <p>§ iv. Refer the question to the ancient inhabitants of the <lb/>
            earth, to the first mothers and fathers. There was no <lb/>
            law ordering them to have families, no expectation of <lb/>
            advantage or return to be got out of them. I should rather <lb/>
            say that mothers would be likely to be hostile and bear <lb/>
            malice to their babes, owing to the great danger and pains <lb/>
            of travail. And women say the lines, “ When the sharp <lb/>
            pangs of travail seize on the pregnant woman, then come <lb/>
            to her aid the Ilithyiæ, who help women in hard child- <lb/>
            birth, those daughters of Hera, goddesses of travail,”2 were <lb/>
            not written by Homer, but by some Homerid who had been <lb/>
            a mother, or was even then in the throes of travail, and <lb/>
            who vividly felt the sharp pain in her womb. But the <lb/>
            love to one's offspring implanted by nature, moves and <lb/>
            influences the mother even then: in the very height of <lb/>
            her throes, she neglects not nor flees from her babe, but <lb/>
            turns to it and smiles at it, and takes it up and caresses it, <lb/>
            though she derives no pleasure or utility from it, but with <lb/>
            pain and sorrow receives it, " warming it and fostering it <note type="footnote"> sometimes speak more plainly than we can. Ever and anon one must <lb/>

            in swaddling clothes, with unintermittent assiduity both <lb/>
            night and day.”1 What hope of gain or advantage had <lb/>
            they in those days ? nay, or even now ? for the hopes of <lb/>
            parents are uncertain, and have to be long waited for. He <lb/>
            who plants a vine in the spring equinox, gleans its vintage <lb/>
            in the autumnal equinox; he who sows corn when the <lb/>
            Pleiads set, reaps it when they rise ; cattle and horses and <lb/>
            birds have produce at once fit for use; whereas man's <lb/>
            bringing up is toilsome, his growth slow; and as ex­ <lb/>
            cellence flowers late, most fathers die before their sons <lb/>
            attain to fame. Neocles lived not to see Themistocles' <lb/>
            victory at Salamis, nor Miltiades Cimon's at the Eurymedon, <lb/>
            nor did Xanthippus hear Pericles haranguing, nor did <lb/>
            Aristo hear Plato philosophizing, nor did their fathers <lb/>
            know of the triumphs of Euripides and Sophocles. They <lb/>
            heard them faltering in speech and lisping in syllables, the <lb/>
            poor parents saw their errors in revelling and drinking and <lb/>
            love-affairs, so that of all Evenus’2 lines, that one alone is <lb/>
            most remembered and quoted, " to a father a son is always <lb/>
            a cause of fear or pain." Nevertheless, parents do not <lb/>
            cease to bring up sons, even when they can least need <lb/>
            them. For it is ridiculous to suppose that the rich, when <lb/>
            they have sons, sacrifice and rejoice that they will have <lb/>
            people to take care of them and to bury them ; unless <lb/>
            indeed they bring up sons from want of heirs ; as if one <lb/>
            could not find or fall in with anyone who would be willing <lb/>
            to have another's property! Why, the sand on the sea <lb/>
            shore, and the dust, and the wings of birds of varied note, <lb/>
            are less numerous than the number of would-be heirs. <lb/>
            For had Danaus, the father of fifty daughters, been child­ <lb/>
            less, he would have had more heirs, and of a different <lb/>
            spirit. For sons have no gratitude, nor regard, nor venera­ <lb/>
            tion for inheritance; but take it as a debt; whereas the <lb/>
            voices of strangers which you hear round the childless man, <lb/>
            are like those lines in the play, " 0 People, first bathe, <lb/>
            after one decision in the courts, then eat, drink, gobble, <lb/>
            take the three-obol-piece.”3 And what Euripides has <lb/>
            said, “ Money finds friends for men, and has the greatest <note type="footnote"> 1 A fragment from Euripides, according to Xylander. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Evenus of Paros was an Elegiac Poet. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Aristophanes, “Equites,” 50, 51. </note> <lb/>

            power among mankind," is not merely a general truth, but <lb/>
            is especially true in the case of the childless. For those <lb/>
            the rich entertain to dinner, those great men pay court to, <lb/>
            to those alone orators give their services gratis. “A <lb/>
            mighty personage is a rich man, whose heir is unknown." <lb/>
            It has at any rate made many much loved and honoured, <lb/>
            whom the possession of one child would have made un­ <lb/>
            loved and insignificant. Whence we see that there is no <lb/>
            power or advantage to be got from children, but that the <lb/>
            love of them, alike in mankind as among the animals, pro­ <lb/>
            ceeds entirely from nature.</p>
          <p>§ v. What if this natural affection, like many other <lb/>
            virtues, is obscured by badness, as a wilderness chokes a <lb/>
            garden ? Are we to say that man does not love himself <lb/>
            by nature, because many cut their throats or throw them­ <lb/>
            selves down precipices ? Did not CEdipus put out his <lb/>
            eyes ? And did not Hegesias by his speeches make many <lb/>
            of his hearers to commit suicide ?1 " Fatality has many <lb/>
            different aspects.”2 But all these are diseases and maladies <lb/>
            of the soul driving a man contrary to nature out of his <lb/>
            wits: as men themselves testify even against themselves. <lb/>
            For if a sow destroys one of its litter, or a bitch one of its <lb/>
            pups, men are dejected and troubled, and think it an evil <lb/>
            omen, and sacrifice to the gods to avert any bad results, on <lb/>
            the score that it is natural to all to love and cherish their <lb/>
            offspring, unnatural to destroy it. For just as in mines the <lb/>
            gold is conspicuous even though mixed up with earth, so <lb/>
            nature manifests plainly love to offspring even in instances <lb/>
            of faulty habits and affections. For when the poor do not <lb/>
            rear their children, it is from fear that if reared to man's <lb/>
            estate they would be more than ought to be the case servile, <lb/>
            and have little culture, and be debarred of all advantages: <lb/>
            so, thinking poverty the worst of all evils, they cannot bear <lb/>
            to give it their children, any more than they would some <lb/>
            bad diseased <note type="footnote"> 1 See Cicero " Tuscul." i. 34. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Euripides, "Alcestis," 1159; "Helena," 1688; “Andromache,” <lb/>

          <p>I. Flavianus.—You say that it was on Mount Helicon, <lb/>
            Autobulus, that those conversations took place about Love, <lb/>
            -which you are now about to narrate to us at our request, <lb/>
            as you either wrote them down, or at least remember them <lb/>
            from frequently asking our father about them.</p>
          <p>Autobulus.—It was on Mount Helicon among the Muses, <lb/>
            Flavianus, when the people of Thespiæ were celebrating <lb/>
            their Festival to the God of Love, which they celebrate <lb/>
            very magnificently and splendidly every five years to that <lb/>
            God, as also to the Muses.</p>
          <p>Flavianus.— Do you know what all of us who have come <lb/>
            to this audience intend to ask of you ?</p>
          <p>Autobulus.—No, but I shall know if you tell me.</p>
          <p>Flavianus.—Remove from your discourse for this once <lb/>
            the poet's meadows and shades, and talk about ivy and <lb/>
            yews, and all other commonplaces of that kind that writers <lb/>
            love to introduce, with more zeal than discretion, in imita­ <lb/>
            tion of Plato's Ilissus and the famous willow and the <lb/>
            gentle slope of grass.1</p>
          <p>Autobulus.—My dear Flavianus, my narrative needs not <lb/>
            any such exordium. The occasion that caused the conver­ <lb/>
            sation simply demands a chorus for the action and a stage, <lb/>
            nothing else is wanting to the drama, let us only pray to <lb/>
            the Mother of the Muses to be propitious, and give me <lb/>
            memory for my narrative.</p>
          <p>§ II. Long ago our father, before we were born, having <lb/>
            lately married our mother, had gone to sacrifice to the God <lb/>
            of Love, in consequence of a dispute and variance that <lb/>
            broke out among their parents, and took our mother to the <lb/>
            Festival, for she also had her part in the vow and sacrifice. <lb/>
            Some of their intimate friends journeyed with them from <lb/>
            the town where they lived, and when they got to Thespiæ <note type="footnote"> I The allusion is to Plato's “Phædrus,” p. 230, B. Much, indeed, <lb/>
            of the subject-matter here is, we shall find, somewhat similar to that of <lb/>
            the Phædrus. </note> <lb/>

            they found there Daphnæus the son of Archidamus, a <lb/>
            lover of Lysandra the daughter of Simo, and of all her <lb/>
            suitors the one who stood highest in her favour, and <lb/>
            Soclarus the son of Aristio, who had come from Tithorea. <lb/>
            And there were there also Protogenes of Tarsus, and <lb/>
            Zeuxippus from Sparta, strangers, and my father said most <lb/>
            of the most notable Bœotians were there also. For two or <lb/>
            three days they went about the town in one another's <lb/>
            company, as it was likely they would do, quietly carrying <lb/>
            on philosophical discussions in the wrestling-schools and <lb/>
            theatres: after that, to avoid a wearisome contest of <lb/>
            harpers, decided beforehand by canvassing and cabal, most <lb/>
            broke up their camp as if they had been in a hostile <lb/>
            country, and removed to Mount Helicon, and bivouacked <lb/>
            there with the Muses. In the morning they were visited <lb/>
            by Anthemion and Pisias, both men of good repute, and <lb/>
            very great friends of Baccho, who was surnamed the Hand­ <lb/>
            some, and also rivals of one another somewhat through <lb/>
            their affection for him. Now you must know that there <lb/>
            was at Thespiæ a lady called Ismenodora, famous for her <lb/>
            wealth and good family, and of uncommon good repute for <lb/>
            her virtuous life : for she had been a widow some time <lb/>
            without a breath of slander lighting upon her, though she <lb/>
            was young and good-looking. As Baccho was the son of a <lb/>
            friend and crony of hers, she had tried to bring about a <lb/>
            marriage between him and a maiden who was her own <lb/>
            relation, but by frequently being in his company and talk­ <lb/>
            ing to him she had got rather smitten with him herself. <lb/>
            And hearing much in his favour, and often talking about <lb/>
            him, and seeing that many noble young men were in love <lb/>
            with him, she fell violently in love with him, and, being <lb/>
            resolved to do nothing unbecoming to her fair fame, <lb/>
            determined to marry and live openly with him. And the <lb/>
            matter seeming in itself rather odd, Baccho's mother looked <lb/>
            rather askance at the proposed matrimonial alliance as <lb/>
            being too high and splendid for her son, while some of his <lb/>
            companions who used to go out hunting with him, frighten­ <lb/>
            ing him and flouting him with Ismenodora's being rather <lb/>
            too old for him, really did more to break off the match <lb/>
            than those who seriously opposed it. And Baccho, being <lb/>
            only a youth, somehow felt a little ashamed at the idea of <lb/>
             <pb n="31"/>
            marrying a widow, but, neglecting the opinions of every­ <lb/>
            body else, he submitted the decision as to the expediency <lb/>
            of the marriage to Pisias and Anthemion, the latter being <lb/>
            his cousin, though older than him, and the former the <lb/>
            gravest 1 of his lovers. Pisias objected to the marriage, and <lb/>
            upbraided Anthemion with throwing the youth away on <lb/>
            Ismenodora. Anthemion replied that it was not well in <lb/>
            Pisias, being a good fellow in other respects, to imitate <lb/>
            depraved lovers by shutting out his friend from house and <lb/>
            marriage and wealth, merely that he might enjoy the sight <lb/>
            of him as long as possible naked and in all his virgin <lb/>
            bloom at the wrestling-schools.</p>
          <p>§ III. To avoid getting estranged by provoking one <lb/>
            another on the question, they came and chose our father <lb/>
            and his companions as umpires on the matter. And of the <lb/>
            other friends, as if by concerted arrangement, Daphnaeus <lb/>
            espoused the view of Anthemion, and Protogenes the view <lb/>
            of Pisias. And Protogenes inveighing somewhat too freely <lb/>
            against Ismenodora, Daphnæus took him up and said, <lb/>
            " Hercules, what are we not to expect, if Protogenes is <lb/>
            going to be hostile to love ? he whose whole life, whether <lb/>
            in work or at play, has been devoted to love, in forgetful­ <lb/>
            ness of letters, in forgetfulness of his country, not like <lb/>
            Laius, away from his country only five days, his was <lb/>
            only a torpid and land love: whereas your love ' unfold­ <lb/>
            ing its swift wings,' flew over the sea from Cilicia to <lb/>
            Athens, merely to gaze at and saunter about with handsome <lb/>
            boys. For that was the original reason, doubtless, of <lb/>
            Protogenes' journey abroad."</p>
          <p>§ iv. And some laughter ensuing, Proto genes replied, <lb/>
            " Do I really seem to you now to be hostile to love, and <lb/>
            not to be fighting for love against ungovernable lust, <lb/>
            which with most disgraceful acts and emotions assumes <lb/>
            the most honourable of titles ? " Whereupon Daphnæus, <lb/>
            " Do you call the marriage and union of man and woman <lb/>
            most disgraceful, than which no holier tie exists nor ever <note type="footnote"> 1 It is difficult to know what the best English word here is. From <lb/>
            the sly thrust in § ix. Pisias was evidently grey. I have therefore <lb/>
            selected the word gravest. But the most austere, the most sensible, the <lb/>
            most solid, the most sedate, all might express the Greek word also. Let <lb/>
            the reader take which he likes best. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="32"/>
            did ? " Protogenes replied, " Why, as all this is necessary <lb/>
            for the human race to continue, our legislators do not act <lb/>
            amiss in crying up marriage and eulogizing it to the <lb/>
            masses, but of genuine love there is not a particle in the <lb/>
            woman's side of a house; 1 and I also say that yon who <lb/>
            are sweet on women and girls only love them as flies love <lb/>
            milk, and bees the honey-comb, and butchers and cooks <lb/>
            calves and birds, fattening them up in darkness.2 But as <lb/>
            nature leads one to eat and drink moderately and sum­ <lb/>
            ciently, and excess in this is called gluttony and gorman­ <lb/>
            dizing, so the mutual desires between men and women are <lb/>
            natural; but that headlong, violent, and uncontrollable <lb/>
            passion for the sex is not rightly called love. For love, <lb/>
            when it seizes a noble and young soul, ends in virtue <lb/>
            through friendship; but these violent passions for women, at <lb/>
            the best, aim only at carnal enjoyment and reaping the <lb/>
            harvest of a beauteous prime, as Aristippus showed in his <lb/>
            answer to one who told him Lais loved him not, ' No more,' <lb/>
            he said, ' do meat and wine love me, but I gladly enjoy <lb/>
            both.'3 For the end of passion is pleasure and fruition : but <lb/>
            love, when it has once lost the promise of friendship, will <lb/>
            not remain and continue to cherish merely for beauty that <lb/>
            which gives it pain, where it gives no return of friendship <lb/>
            and virtue. You remember the husband in the play saying <lb/>
            to his wife, ' Do you hate me ? I can bear that hatred <lb/>
            very easily, since of my dishonour I make money.' Not a <lb/>
            whit more really in love than this husband is the one, who, <lb/>
            not for gain but merely for the sexual appetite, puts up <lb/>
            with a peevish and unsympathetic wife, as Philippides, the <lb/>
            comic poet, ridiculed the orator, Stratocles, ' You scarce <lb/>
            can kiss her if she turns her back on you.' If, however, <lb/>
            we ought to give the name of love to this passion, then is <lb/>
            it an effeminate and bastard love, and like at Cynosarges, t <lb/>
            taking us to the woman's side of the house: or rather as <note type="footnote"> 1 In a Greek house the women and men had each their own separate <lb/>
            apartments.

            they say there is a genuine mountain eagle, which Homer <lb/>
            called black, and a bird of prey,' and there are other <lb/>
            kinds of spurious eagles, which catch fish and lazy birds <lb/>
            in marshes, and often in want of food emit an hungry wail: <lb/>
            so the genuine love is the love of boys, a love not 4 flashing <lb/>
            with desire,' as Anacreon said the love of maidens was, nor <lb/>
            'redolent of ointment and sprightly,' but you will see it <lb/>
            plain and without airs in the schools of the philosophers, <lb/>
            or perhaps in the gymnasiums and wrestling-schools, <lb/>
            keenly and nobly pursuing youths, and urging on to virtue <lb/>
            those who are well worthy of attention : but that soft <lb/>
            and stay-at-home love, spending all its time in women's <lb/>
            bosoms and beds, always pursuing effeminate delights, and <lb/>
            enervated by unmanly, unfriendly, and unimpassioned <lb/>
            pleasures, we ought to condemn as Solon condemned it: <lb/>
            for he forbade slaves to love boys or to anoint them with <lb/>
            oil, while he allowed them to associate with women. For <lb/>
            friendship is noble and refined, whereas pleasure is vulgar <lb/>
            and illiberal. Therefore, for a slave to love boys is neither <lb/>
            liberal or refined : for it is merely the love of copulation, as <lb/>
            the love of women."</p>
          <p>§ v. Protogenes was intending to go on at greater length, <lb/>
            when Daphnæus stopped him and said, " You do well, by <lb/>
            Zens, to mention Solon, and we too may use him as the <lb/>
            test of an amorous man. Does he not define such a one <lb/>
            in the lines, ' As long as you love boys in the glorious flower <lb/>
            of their youth for their kisses and embraces.' And add to <lb/>
            Solon the lines of Æschylus, ' You did not disdain the <lb/>
            honour of the thighs, 0 thankless one after all my fre­ <lb/>
            quent kisses.' 1 For some laugh at them if they bid lovers, <lb/>
            like sacrificing priests and seers, to inspect thighs and loins; <lb/>
            but I think this a mighty argument in behalf of the love <lb/>
            of women. For if the unnatural commerce with males does <lb/>
            not take away or mar the amorous propensity, much more <lb/>
            likely is it that the natural love of women will end in <lb/>
            friendship after the favour. For, Protogenes, the yielding <lb/>
            of the female to the male was called by the ancients the <lb/>
            favour. Thus Pindar says Hephæstus was the son of Hera <note type="footnote"> 1 Fragment of Æschylus. See Athenæus, xiii. p. 602, E, which <lb/>
            explains the otherwise obscure allusion. </note> <note type="footnote"> D </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="34"/>
            ' without any favours' :1 and Sappho, addressing a girl not <lb/>
            yet ripe for marriage, says to her, 'You seemed to me a little <lb/>
            girl, too young for the favour.' And someone asks Hercules, <lb/>
            ' Did you obtain the girl's favour by force or by persuasion ?' <lb/>
            But the love of males for males, whether rape or voluntary <lb/>
            — pathicks effeminately submitting, to use Plato's words, <lb/>
            ' to be treated bestially '—is altogether a foul and unlovely <lb/>
            favour. And so I think Solon wrote the lines quoted above <lb/>
            , in his hot youth,' as Plato puts it; but when he became <lb/>
            older wrote these other lines, ' Now I delight in Cyprus­ <lb/>
            born Aphrodite, and in Dionysus, and in the Muses : all <lb/>
            these give joys to men ': as if, after the heat and tempest <lb/>
            of his boyish loves, he had got into a quiet haven of mar­ <lb/>
            riage and philosophy. But indeed, Protogenes, if we look <lb/>
            at the real facts of the case, the love for boys and women is <lb/>
            really one and the same passion : but if you wish in a dispu­ <lb/>
            tatious spirit to make any distinction, you will find that this <lb/>
            boy-love goes beyond all bounds, and, like some late-born <lb/>
            and ill-begotten bastard brat, seeks to expel its legitimate <lb/>
            brother the older love, the love of women. For indeed, <lb/>
            friend, it is only yesterday or the day before, since the <lb/>
            strippings and exposures of the youths in the gymnasiums, <lb/>
            that this boy-love crept in, and gently insinuated itself and <lb/>
            got a footing, and at last in a little time got fully-fledged <lb/>
            in the wrestling-schools, and has now got fairly unbearable, <lb/>
            and insults and tramples on conjugal love, that love that <lb/>
            gives immortality to our mortal race, when our nature has <lb/>
            been extinguished by death, kindling it again by new births. <lb/>
            And this boy-love denies that pleasure is its aim : for it is <lb/>
            ashamed and afraid to confess the truth : but it needs some <lb/>
            specious excuse for the liberties it takes with handsome boys <lb/>
            in their prime: the pretext is friendship and virtue. So your <lb/>
            boy-lover wallows in the dust, bathes in cold water, raises his <lb/>
            eyebrows, gives himself out for a philosopher, and lives <lb/>
            chaste abroad because of the law: but in the stillness of <lb/>
            night <lb/>
            ' Sweet is the ripe fruit when the guards withdrawn.'2 <note type="footnote"> 1 That is the son of Hera alone, who was unwilling to be outdone by <lb/>

            But if, as Protogenes says, there is no carnal intercourse <lb/>
            in these boy-familiarities, how is it Love, if Aphrodite is <lb/>
            not present, whom it is the destiny of Love to cherish and <lb/>
            pay court to, and to partake of just as much honour and <lb/>
            power as she assigns to him ? But if there is any Love <lb/>
            without Aphrodite, as there is drunkenness without wine <lb/>
            in drinks made from figs and barley, the disturbing it will <lb/>
            be fruitless and without effect, and surfeiting and dis­ <lb/>
            gusting."</p>
          <p>§ vi. At the conclusion of this speech, it was clear that <lb/>
            Pisias was vexed and indignant with Daphnæus; and after <lb/>
            a moment's silence he began : " 0 Hercules ! what levity <lb/>
            and audacity for men to state that they are tied to women <lb/>
            as dogs to bitches, and to banish the god of Love from the <lb/>
            gymnasiums and public walks, and light of day and open <lb/>
            intercourse, and to restrict him to brothels 1 and philtres <lb/>
            and incantations of wanton women: for to chaste women, <lb/>
            I am sure, it belongs not either to love or be loved." At <lb/>
            this point our father told me he interposed, and took <lb/>
            Protogenes by the hand, and said to him : <lb/>
            " 'This word of yours rouses the Argive host,' <lb/>
            and of a verity Pisias makes us to side with Daphnæus <lb/>
            by his extravagant language, charging marriage with being <lb/>
            a loveless intercourse, and one that has no participation in <lb/>
            divine friendship, although we can see that it is an inter­ <lb/>
            course, if erotic persuasion and favour fail, that cannot be <lb/>
            restrained by shame and fear as by bit and bridle." There­ <lb/>
            upon Pisias said, " I care little about his arguments; but <lb/>
            I see that Daphnæus is in the same condition as brass: for, <lb/>
            just as it is not worked upon so much by the agency of fire <lb/>
            as by the molten and liquid brass fused with it, so is he <lb/>
            not so much captivated by the beauty of Lysandra as by <lb/>
            his association with one who is the victim of the gentle <lb/>
            passion ; and it is plain that, if he doesn't take refuge with <note type="footnote"> " Athenæus," 608, F. Daphnæus implies these very nice gentlemen, <lb/>
            like the same class described by Juvenal, " Curios simulant et Baccha­ <lb/>

            us, he will soon melt away in the flame altogether. But I <lb/>
            see, what Anthemion would very much like, that I am <lb/>
            offending the Court, so I stop." " You amuse us," said <lb/>
            Anthemion : " but you ought from the first to have spoken <lb/>
            to the point."</p>
          <p>§ vii. " I say then," continued Pisias, " and give it out <lb/>
            boldly, as far as I am concerned, let every woman have a lover; <lb/>
            but we ought to guard against giving the wealth of Ismeno­ <lb/>
            dora to Baccho, lest, if we involve him in so much grandeur <lb/>
            and magnificence, we unwittingly lose him in it, as tin is <lb/>
            lost in brass. For if the lad were to marry quite a plain <lb/>
            and insignificant woman, it would be great odds whether <lb/>
            he would keep the upper hand, as wine mixed with water; <lb/>
            and Ismenodora seems already marked out for sway and <lb/>
            command; for otherwise she would not have rejected such <lb/>
            illustrious and wealthy suitors to woo a lad hardly yet <lb/>
            arrived at man's estate, and almost requiring a tutor still. <lb/>
            And therefore men of sense prune the excessive wealth of <lb/>
            their wives, as if it had wings that required clipping ; for <lb/>
            this same wealth implants in them luxury, caprice, and <lb/>
            vanity, by which they are often elated and fly away alto­ <lb/>
            gether : but if they remain, it would be better to be bound <lb/>
            by golden fetters, as in Ethiopia, than to a woman's <lb/>
            wealth."</p>
          <p>§ viii. Here Proto genes put in, "You say nothing about <lb/>
            the risk we run of unseasonably and ridiculously reversing <lb/>
            the well-known advice of Hesiod : <lb/>
            , If seasonable marriage you would make, <lb/>
            Let about thirty be the bridegroom's age, <lb/>
            The bride be in the fifth year of her womanhood:'1 <lb/>
            if we thus marry a lad hardly old enough for marriage to a <lb/>
            woman so many years older, than himself, as dates and figs <lb/>
            are forced. You will say she loves him passionately: who <lb/>
            prevents her, then, from serenading at his doors, singing <lb/>
            her amorous ditty, putting garlands on his statues, and <lb/>
            wrestling and boxing with her rivals in his affections? <lb/>
            For all these are what people in love do. And let her <lb/>
            lower her eyebrows, and give up the airs of a coquette, and <note type="footnote"> I "Works and Days," 606-608. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="37"/>
            assume the appearance of those that are deeply smitten. <lb/>
            But if she is modest and chaste, let her decorously stay at <lb/>
            home and await there her lovers and sweethearts; for any <lb/>
            sensible man would be disgusted and flee from a woman <lb/>
            who took the initiative in love, far less would he be likely <lb/>
            to marry her after such a barefaced wooing."</p>
          <p>§ ix. When Protogenes had done speaking, my father <lb/>
            said, " Do you see, Anthemion, that they force us to inter­ <lb/>
            vene again, who have no objection to dance in the retinue <lb/>
            of conjugal Love? " "I do," said Anthemion, " but pray <lb/>
            defend Love at some length, as you are on his side, and <lb/>
            moreover come to the rescue of wealthy with which Pisias <lb/>
            seeks to scare us." Thereupon my father began, " What <lb/>
            on earth will not be brought as a charge against a woman, <lb/>
            if we are to reject Ismenodora because she is in love and <lb/>
            has money ? Granted she loves sway and is rich ? What <lb/>
            then, if she is young and handsome ? And what if she <lb/>
            plumes herself somewhat on the lustre of her race ? Have <lb/>
            not chaste women often something of the morose and peevish <lb/>
            in their character almost past bearing ? Do they not <lb/>
            sometimes get called waspish and shrewish by virtue of <lb/>
            their very chastity ? Would it be best then to marry off <lb/>
            the street some Thracian Abrotonus, or some Milesian <lb/>
            Bacchis, and seal the bargain by the present of a handful <lb/>
            of nuts ? But we have known even such turn out intoler­ <lb/>
            able tyrants, Syrian flute-girls and ballet-dancers, as Aria­ <lb/>
            tonica, and Œnanthe with her tambourine, and Agatho­ <lb/>
            clea, who have lorded it over kings' diadems.2 Why <lb/>
            Syrian Semiramis was only the servant and concubine of <lb/>
            one of king Ninus's slaves, till Ninus the great king seeing <lb/>
            and falling in love with her, she got such power over him <lb/>
            that she thought so cheap of him, that she asked to be <lb/>
            allowed one day to sit on the royal throne, with the royal <lb/>
            diadem on her head, and to transact state affairs. And <note type="footnote"> 1 I follow here the reading of Wyttenbach. Through the whole of <lb/>

            Ninus having granted her permission, and having ordered <lb/>
            all his subjects to obey her as himself, sibe first gave several <lb/>
            very moderate orders to make trial of the guards; but <lb/>
            when she raw that they obeyed her without the slightest <lb/>
            hesitation, she ordered them to seize Ninus and put him in <lb/>
            fetters, and at last put him to death ; and all her commands <lb/>
            being obeyed, she ruled over Asia for a long time with <lb/>
            great lustre. And was not Belestiche a foreign woman off <lb/>
            the streets, although at Alexandria she has shrines and <lb/>
            temples, with an inscription as Aphrodite Belestiche, which <lb/>
            she owes to the king's love ? And she who has in this <lb/>
            very town1 a temple and rites in common with Eros, and <lb/>
            at Delphi stands in gold among kings and queens, by what <lb/>
            dowry got she her lovers ? But just as the lovers oi <lb/>
            Semiramis, Belestiche, and Phryne, became their prey un­ <lb/>
            consciously through their weakness and effeminacy, so on <lb/>
            the other hand poor and obscure men, having contracted <lb/>
            alliances with rich women of rank, have not been thereby <lb/>
            spoilt nor merged their personality, but have lived with <lb/>
            their wives on a footing of kindness, yet still kept their <lb/>
            position as heads of the house. But he that abases his <lb/>
            wife and makes her small, like one who tightens the ring <lb/>
            on a finger too small for it fearing it will come off,2 is like <lb/>
            those who cut their mares'tails off and then take them to a <lb/>
            river or pond to drink, when they say that sorrowfully dis­ <lb/>
            cerning their loss of beauty these mares lose their self-respect <lb/>
            and allow themselves to be covered by asses.3 To select a <lb/>
            wife for wealth rather than for her excellence or family is <lb/>
            dishonourable and illiberal; but it is silly to reject wealth <lb/>
            when it is accompanied by excellence and family. Anti­ <lb/>
            gonus indeed wrote to his officer who had garrisoned <lb/>
            Munychia4 to make not only the collar strong but the dog <lb/>
            lean, that he might undermine the strength of the Athenians; <lb/>
            but it becomes not the husband of a rich or handsome <lb/>
            woman to make his wife poor or ugly, but by his self-con- <note type="footnote"> 1 Thespiæ. The allusion is to Phryne. See Pausanias, ix. 27; x. 15. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Reading with Wyttenbach, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὥσπερ δακτύλιον δακτύλου ἰσχνου̃, ώ <lb/>

            creation of children; Ismenodora, I hear, is still in her <lb/>
            prime, and " (here my father smiled slily at Pisias) " she <lb/>
            is certainly not a bit older than her rivals, and has no <lb/>
            grey hairs, as some of those who consort with Baccho <lb/>
            have. And if their union is seasonable, who knows <lb/>
            but that she may be a better partner for him than any <lb/>
            young woman? For young couples do not blend and mix <lb/>
            well together, and it takes a long time and is not an easy <lb/>
            process for them to divest themselves of their pride and <lb/>
            spirit, and at first there's a good deal of dirty weather and <lb/>
            they don't pull well together, and this is oftenest the case <lb/>
            when there's love on both sides, and, just as a storm wrecks <lb/>
            the ship if no pilot is on board, so their marriage is trouble <lb/>
            and confusion, neither party knowing how either to rule or <lb/>
            to give way properly. And if the baby is under the nurse, <lb/>
            and the boy under the master, and the lad under the master <lb/>
            of the gymnasium, and the youth under his lover, and the <lb/>
            full-grown man under the law and magistrate, and no one <lb/>
            is his own master and exempt from obedience to someone, <lb/>
            what wonder would it be if a sensible woman rather older <lb/>
            than her husband would direct well the life of a young <lb/>
            man, being useful to him by reason of her superior wisdom, <lb/>
            and acceptable to him for her sweetness and gentleness ? <lb/>
            And to sum up the whole matter," said he, " we Bœotians <lb/>
            ought to revere Hercules, and so find no fault in any in­ <lb/>
            equality of age in marriages, seeing that he gave his own <lb/>
            wife Megara in marriage to Iolaus, though he was only <lb/>
            sixteen and she three-and-thirty." 1</p>
          <p>§ x. As the conversation was going on, our father said <lb/>
            that a friend of Pisias came galloping up from the town to <lb/>
            report an act of marvellous audacity. Ismenodora, it <lb/>
            appears, thinking Baccho had no personal dislike to the <note type="footnote"> 1 lolaus was the nephew of Hercules, and was associated with him in <lb/>
            many of his Labours. See Pausanias, i. 19 ; vii. 2 ; viii. 14,45. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="40"/>
            match, but only stood in awe of his friends who tried to <lb/>
            dissuade him from it, determined that she would not let the <lb/>
            young fellow slip through her fingers. Accordingly, she <lb/>
            sent for the most active and intimate 1 of her male friends, <lb/>
            and for some of her female cronies, and instructed them as <lb/>
            to what part they should play, and waited for the hour <lb/>
            when Baccho was accustomed regularly to pass by her house <lb/>
            on his way to the wrestling-school. And as he passed by <lb/>
            on this occasion with two or three of his companions, <lb/>
            anointed for the exercise, Ismenodora met him at the door <lb/>
            and just touched his cloak, and her friends rushed out all <lb/>
            together and prettily seized the pretty fellow as he was in <lb/>
            his cloak and jersey,2 and hurried him into the house and <lb/>
            at once locked the doors. And the women inside at once <lb/>
            divested him of his cloak and put on him a bridal robe; <lb/>
            and the servants ran about the town and put olive wreaths <lb/>
            and laurel garlands at the doors of Baccho's house as well <lb/>
            as Ismenodora's, and a flute-girl went up and down the <lb/>
            street playing and singing the wedding-song. And some <lb/>
            of the inhabitants of Thespiæand the strangers laughed, <lb/>
            others were indignant and tried to make the superintendents <lb/>
            of the gymnasium move in the matter, for they have great <lb/>
            power in Thespiæ over the youths, and pay great attention <lb/>
            to their actions. And now there was no more talk about <lb/>
            the sports, but everyone left the theatre for the neighbour­ <lb/>
            hood of Ismenodora's house, and there stood in groups <lb/>
            talking and disputing about what had happened.</p>
          <p>§ XI. Now when Pisias' friend had come up like an aide­ <lb/>
            de-camp in war, " bloody with spurring, fiery red with <lb/>
            haste," to report this news that Ismenodora had seized <lb/>
            Baccho, my father said that Zeuxippus smiled, and being a <lb/>
            great lover of Euripides repeated the line, <lb/>
            " Lady, though rich, thou hast thy sex's feelings." <lb/>
            But Pisias jumped up and cried out, "Ye gods, what <lb/>
            will be the end of license like this which will overthrow <lb/>
            our town ? Already we are fast tending to lawlessness <lb/>
            through our independence. And yet it is perhaps ridicu- <note type="footnote"> 1 I read <foreign xml:lang="grc">συνοαρίζοντας</foreign>. The general reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">συνερω̃ντας</foreign>will hardly <lb/>

             <pb n="41"/>
            Ions to be indignant about law and justice, when nature <lb/>
            itself is trampled upon by being thus subjected to women ? <lb/>
            Saw even Lemnos ever the like of this ? 1 Let us go," he <lb/>
            continued, " let us go and hand over to the women the <lb/>
            gymnasium and council-hall, if the townsmen have lost all <lb/>
            their nerve." Pisias then left the company, and Protogenes <lb/>
            went with him, partly sympathizing with his indignation, <lb/>
            but still endeavouring to cool him. And Anthemion said, <lb/>
            " 'Twas a bold deed and certainly does savour somewhat of <lb/>
            Lemnos—I own it now we are alone-this Ismenodora must <lb/>
            be most violently in love." Hereupon Soclarus said, with <lb/>
            a sly smile, " You don't think then that this rape and de­ <lb/>
            tention was an excuse and stratagem on the part of a wily <lb/>
            young man to escape from the clutches of his lovers, and fly <lb/>
            of his own volition to the arms of a rich and handsome <lb/>
            widow ? " " Pray don't say so, Soclarus," said Anthemion, <lb/>
            " pray don't entertain any such suspicions of Baccho, for <lb/>
            even if he were not by nature most simple and naive, he <lb/>
            would not have concealed the matter from me to whom he <lb/>
            divulges all his secrets, especially as he knows that I have <lb/>
            always been very anxious he should marry Ismenodora. <lb/>
            But as Heraclitus says truly, It is more difficult to control <lb/>
            love than anger; for whatever love has a fancy to, it will <lb/>
            buy even at the cost of life, money, and reputation. Who <lb/>
            lives a more quiet life in our town than Ismenodora ? <lb/>
            When did ever any ugly rumour attach itself to her ? When <lb/>
            did ever any breath of suspicion sully her house ? Some <lb/>
            divine inspiration, beyond human calculation, seems now to <lb/>
            have possessed her."</p>
          <p>§ XII. Then Pemptides laughed and said, " Of course <lb/>
            you know that there is a certain disease of the body called <lb/>
            the sacred diseased It is no wonder, therefore, if some call <lb/>
            the greatest and most insane passion of the soul sacred and <lb/>
            divine. However, as in Egypt I once saw two neighbours <note type="footnote"> 1 The women of Lemnos were very masterful. On one memorable <lb/>
            occasion they killed all their husbands in one night. Thus the line of <lb/>
            Ovid has almost a proverbial force, " Lemniadesque viros nimium <lb/>
            quoque vincere norunt."—Heroides, vi. 53. Siebelis in his Preface to <lb/>
            Pausanias, p. xxi, gives from an old Scholia a sort of excuse for the <lb/>
            action of the women of Lemnos. </note><note type="footnote"> 2Probably the epilepsy. See Herodotus, iii. 33. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="42"/>
            disputing when a serpent passed by them on the road, both <lb/>
            calling it a good omen, but each claiming the blessing as <lb/>
            his alone ; so seeing lately that some of you drag Love to <lb/>
            the men's apartments, while others confine it to the women's <lb/>
            side of the house, while all of you regard it as a divine and <lb/>
            superlative blessing, I do not wonder, since it is a passion <lb/>
            that has such power and honour, that those who ought to <lb/>
            banish it from every quarter and clip its wings do them­ <lb/>
            selves add to its influence and power. And hitherto I held <lb/>
            my peace, for I saw that the discussion turned rather on <lb/>
            private than public interests, but now that we have got rid <lb/>
            of Pisias, I would gladly hear from you to what they had <lb/>
            an eye who first called Love a god."</p>
          <p>§ XIII. Just as Pemptides had left off, and our father was <lb/>
            about to answer his question, another messenger came <lb/>
            from the town, sent by Ismenodora to summon Anthemion, <lb/>
            for the tumult had increased, and there was a difference of <lb/>
            opinion between the superintendents of the gymnasium, one <lb/>
            thinking they ought to demand the liberation of Baccho, the <lb/>
            other thinking they ought not to interfere. Anthemion got <lb/>
            up at once and went off. And our father, addressing Pemp­ <lb/>
            tides especially, said, " You seem to me, my dear Pemptides, <lb/>
            to be handling a great and bold matter, or rather to be <lb/>
            discussing things that ought not to be discussed, in asking <lb/>
            for a reason in each case for our opinion about the gods. <lb/>
            Our ancient and hereditary faith is sufficient, a better <lb/>
            argument than which we cannot either utter or find, <lb/>
            ' Not e'en if wisdom in our brains resides ;'1 <lb/>
            but if this common foundation and basis of all piety be dis­ <lb/>
            turbed, and its stability and time-honoured ideas be un­ <lb/>
            settled, it becomes undermined and is suspected by every­ <lb/>
            body. You have heard, of course, what hot water Euri­ <lb/>
            pides got into, when he wrote at the beginning of his <lb/>
            ' Melanippe,' <lb/>
            ' Zeus, whosoe'er he is, I do not know <lb/>
            Except by hearsay,'2 <lb/>
            but if he changed the opening line, he had confidence, <note type="footnote"> 1 Euripides, " Baccbae," 203. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Euripides, Fragment of the " Melanippe." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="43"/>
            it seems, that his play would go down with the public un­ <lb/>
            commonly well,' so he altered it into <lb/>
            'Zeus the divine, as he is truly called.' 2 <lb/>
            And what difference is there between calling in question <lb/>
            the received opinion about Zeus or Athene, and that about <lb/>
            Love ? For it is not now for the first time that Love asks <lb/>
            for an altar and sacrifices, nor is he a strange god intro­ <lb/>
            duced by foreign superstition, as some Attis or Adonis, far­ <lb/>
            tively smuggled in by hermaphrodites and women, and <lb/>
            secretly receiving honours not his own, to avoid an indict­ <lb/>
            ment among the gods for coming among them under false <lb/>
            pretences. And when, my friend, you hear the words of <lb/>
            Empedocles, <lb/>
            ' Friendship is there too, of same length and breadth, <lb/>
            But with the mind's eye only can you see it, <lb/>
            Till with the sight your very soul is thralled,' <lb/>
            you must suppose that they refer to Love. For this god is in­ <lb/>
            visible, but to be extolled by -as as one of the very oldest gods. <lb/>
            And if you demand proofs about everyone of the gods, laying <lb/>
            a profane band on every temple, and bringing a learned <lb/>
            doubt to every altar, you will scrutinize and pry into every­ <lb/>
            thing. But we need not go far to find Love's pedigree. <lb/>
            ' See you how great a goddess Aphrodite is ? <lb/>
            She 'tis that gave us and engendered Love, <lb/>
            Whereof come all that on the earth do live.'3 <lb/>
            And so Empedocles calls Aphrodite Life-giving,4 and <lb/>
            Sophocles calls her Fruitful, both very appropriate epithets. <lb/>
            And though the wonderful act of generation belongs to <lb/>
            Aphrodite only, and Love is only present in it as a subor­ <lb/>
            dinate, yet if he be absent the whole affair becomes unde­ <lb/>
            sirable, and low, and tame. For a loveless coition brings <lb/>
            only satiety, as the satisfaction of hunger and thirst, and <lb/>
            has nothing noble resulting from it, whereas by Love <lb/>
            Aphrodite removes the cloying element in pleasure, and <note type="footnote"> 1 I take Wyttenbach's suggestion as to the reading here. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This line is taken bodily by Aristophanes in his "Frogs," 1244. </note><note type="footnote"> 8 The first line is the first line of a passage from Euripides, consisting <lb/>
            of thirteen lines, containing similar sentiments to this. See Athenæus, <lb/>
            xiii. p. 599, F. The last two lines are from Euripides, " Hippolytus," <lb/>
            449, 450. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Compare Lucretius, i. 1-5. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="44"/>
            produces harmonious friendship. And so Parmenides de­ <lb/>
            clares Love to be the oldest of the creations of Aphrodite, <lb/>
            writing in his Cosmogony, <lb/>
            'Of all the gods first Love she did contrive.' <lb/>
            But Hesiod, more naturally in my opinion, makes Love <lb/>
            the most ancient of all, so that all things derive their <lb/>
            existence from him.1 If we then deprive Love of his an­ <lb/>
            cient honours, those of Aphrodite will be lost also. For we <lb/>
            cannot argue that, while some revile Love, all spare Aphro­ <lb/>
            dite, for on the same stage we hear of Love, <lb/>
            'Love is an idle thing and for the idle :'2 <lb/>
            and again of Aphrodite, <lb/>
            'Cypris, my boys, is not her only name, <lb/>
            For many names has she. She is a hell, <lb/>
            A power remorseless, nay a raging madness."3 <lb/>
            Just as in the case of the other gods there is hardly one <lb/>
            that has not been reviled, or escaped the scurrility of ig­ <lb/>
            norance. Look, for example, at Ares, who may be con­ <lb/>
            sidered as it were the counterpart of Love, what honours <lb/>
            he has received from men, and again what abuse, as <lb/>
            'Ares is blind, ye women, has no eyes, <lb/>
            And with his pig's snout roots up all good things,'4. <lb/>
            And Homer calls him 'blood-stained' and 'fickle.'5 <lb/>
            And Chrysippus brings a grievous charge against him, in <lb/>
            defining his name to mean destroyer,6 thereby giving a <lb/>
            handle to those who think that Ares is only the fighting, <lb/>
            wrangling, and quarrelsome instinct among mankind. <lb/>
            Others again will tell us that Aphrodite is simply desire, <lb/>
            and Hermes eloquence, and the Muses the arts and sciences, <lb/>
            and Athene wisdom. You see what an abyss of impiety <lb/>
            opens up before us, if we describe each of the gods, as only <lb/>
            a passion, a power, or a virtue ! "</p>

            trait, and make the passions gods." " What then ? " said <lb/>
            my father, " do you consider Ares a god, or only a human <lb/>
            passion ? " And Pemptides, answering that he looked on <lb/>
            Ares as god of the passionate and manly element in man­ <lb/>
            kind, " What," cried my father, " shall the passionate and <lb/>
            warlike and antagonistic instincts in man have a god, <lb/>
            but the affectionate and social and clubable have none ? <lb/>
            Shall Ares, under his names of Enyalius and Stratius, pre­ <lb/>
            side over arms and war and sieges and sacks of cities, and <lb/>
            shall there be no god to witness and preside over, to direct <lb/>
            and guide, conjugal affection, that friendship of closest <lb/>
            union and communion ? Why even those who hunt <lb/>
            gazelles and hares and deer have a silvan deity who harks <lb/>
            and halloos them on, for to Aristæus1 they pay their vows <lb/>
            when in pitfalls and snares they trap wolves and bears, <lb/>
            ' For Aristæus first set traps for animals.' <lb/>
            And Hercules invoked another god, when he was about to <lb/>
            shoot at the bird, as the line of Æschylus shows, <lb/>
            ' Hunter Apollo, make my bolt go straight!' 2 <lb/>
            And shall no god or good genius assist and prosper the <lb/>
            man who hunts in the best chase of all, the chase of friend­ <lb/>
            ship ? For I cannot for my part, my dear Daphnæus, <lb/>
            consider man a less beautiful or important plant than the <lb/>
            oak, or sacred olive, or the vine which Homer glorifies,3 <lb/>
            seeing that man too has his growth and glorious prime <lb/>
            alike of soul and body."</p>
          <p>§ xv. Then said Daphnæus, " In the name of the gods, <lb/>
            who thinks differently ? " " All those certainly must," <lb/>
            answered my father, " who think that the gods care only <lb/>
            about ploughing and planting and sowing. Have they not <lb/>
            Nymphs attending upon them, called Dryads, ' whose age <lb/>

            the sacred splendour of Autumn,' as Pindar says ? 4 And if <lb/>
            they care about all this, is there no god or genius who is <lb/>

            the growing man may be upright and virtuous, and that <lb/>
            the nobility of his nature may not be warped and corrupted, <lb/>
            either through want of a guardian or by the depravity of <lb/>
            those he associates with? Is it not monstrous and thankless <lb/>
            to say so, seeing that we enjoy the divine bounty, which is <lb/>
            dealt out to us richly, and never abandons us in our straits? <lb/>
            And yet some of these same straits have more necessity than <lb/>
            beauty. For example, our birth, in spite of the unpleasant <lb/>
            circumstances attending it, is witnessed by the divine <lb/>
            Ilithyia and Artemis : and it would be better not to be <lb/>
            born at all than to become bad through want of a good <lb/>
            guardian and guide. Moreover in sickness the god who is <lb/>
            over that province does not desert us, nor even in death : <lb/>
            for even then there is a conductor and guide for the de­ <lb/>
            parted, to lay them to sleep, and convey their souls to <lb/>
            Hades,1 as the poet says, <lb/>
            ' Night bore me not to be lord of the lyre, <lb/>
            Nor to be seer, or healer of diseases, <lb/>
            But to conduct the souls of the departed.' <lb/>
            And yet these duties involve much unpleasantness, whereas <lb/>
            we cannot mention a holier work, nor any struggle or con­ <lb/>
            test more fitting for a god to attend and play the umpire in, <lb/>
            than the guidance of the young and beautiful in the prose­ <lb/>
            cution of their love-affairs. For there is here nothing of an <lb/>
            unpleasant nature, no compulsion of any kind, but persua­ <lb/>
            sion and grace, truly making toil sweet and labour delight­ <lb/>
            ful, lead the way to virtue and friendship, and do not <lb/>
            arrive at that desired goal without the deity, for they have <lb/>
            as their leader and lord no other god than Love, the com­ <lb/>
            panion of the Muses and Graces and Aphrodite. For <lb/>
            Love 4 sowing in the heart of man the sweet harvest of <lb/>
            desire,' to borrow the language of Melanippides, mixes the <lb/>
            sweetest and most beautiful things together. But per­ <lb/>
            haps you are of a different opinion, Zeuxippus."</p>
          <p>§ xvi. " Not I, by Zeus," replied Zeuxippus. " To have <lb/>
            a different opinion would be ridiculous." " Then," con­ <lb/>
            tinued my father, " is it not also ridiculous, if there are <lb/>
            four kinds of friendship, for so the ancients distinguished, <lb/>
            the natural first, the second that to one's kindred, the third <note type="footnote"> 1 Hermes is alluded to. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="47"/>
            that to one's companions, the fourth the friendship of love, <lb/>
            and each of the. first three have a god as patron, either a <lb/>
            god of friendship, or a god of hospitality, or a god of the <lb/>
            family, or a god of the race,1 whereas the friendship of love <lb/>
            only, as something altogether unholy, is left without any <lb/>
            patron god, and that, too, when it needs most of all atten­ <lb/>
            tive direction ? " "It is," said Zeuxippus, " highly ridicu­ <lb/>
            lous." My father continued, " The language of Plato is <lb/>
            very suggestive here, to make a slight digression. One kind <lb/>
            of madness (he says) is conveyed to the soul from the body <lb/>
            through certain bad temperaments or mixtures, or through <lb/>
            the prevalence of some noxious spirit, and is harsh, difficult <lb/>
            to cure, and baneful. Another kind of madness is not un­ <lb/>
            inspired or from within, but an afflatus from without, a <lb/>
            deviation from sober reason, originated and set in motion <lb/>
            by some higher power, the ordinary characteristic of which <lb/>
            is called enthusiasm. For, as one full of breath is called <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔμπνοος</foreign>, and as one full of sense is called so the <lb/>
            name enthusiasm is given to the commotion of the soul <lb/>
            caused by some Divine agency.2 Thus there is the pro­ <lb/>
            phetic enthusiasm which proceeds from Apollo, and the <lb/>
            Bacchic enthusiasm which comes from Dionysus, to <lb/>
            which Sophocles alludes where he says, ' Dance with the <lb/>
            Corybantes; ' for the rites of Cybele and Pan have great <lb/>
            affinities to the orgies of Bacchus. And the third madness <lb/>
            proceeds from the Muses, and possesses an impressionable <lb/>
            and pure soul, and stirs up the poetry and music in a man. <lb/>
            As to the martial and warlike madness, it is well known <lb/>
            from what god it proceeds, namely, Ares, 'kindling tear­ <lb/>
            ful war, that puts an end to the dance and the song, and <lb/>
            exciting civic strife.'3 There remains, Daphnæus, one <lb/>
            more kind of madness in man, neither obscure nor tranquil, <lb/>
            as to which I should like to ask Pemptides here, <lb/>
            -' What god it is that shakes the fruitful thyrsus ?' <lb/>
            I refer to that love-fury for modest boys and chaste women, <note type="footnote"> 1 All these four were titles of Zeus. They are very difficult to put <lb/>
            into English so as to convey any distinctive and definite idea to an <lb/>
            English reader. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Enthusiasm is the being <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔνθεος</foreign>, or inspired by some god. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 From AEschylus, " Supplices," 681, 682. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="48"/>
            which is far the keenest and fiercest passion of all. For <lb/>
            have you not observed how the soldier, when he lays aside <lb/>
            his arms, ceases from his warlike fury, as the poet says, <lb/>
            ' Then from him <lb/>
            Right gladly did his squires remove the armoury <lb/>
            and sits down a peaceful spectator of others ? 2 The Bacchic <lb/>
            and Cory ban tic dances one can also modulate and quell, by <lb/>
            changing the metre from the trochaic and the measure from <lb/>
            the Phrygian. Similarly, too, the Pythian priestess, when <lb/>
            she descends from her tripod, possesses her soul in peace. <lb/>
            Whereas the love-fury, when once it has really seized on a <lb/>
            man and inflamed him, can be laid by no Muse, no charm <lb/>
            or incantation, no change of place ; but present they burn, <lb/>
            absent they desire, by day they follow their loves about, by <lb/>
            night they serenade them, sober call for them, and drunken <lb/>
            sing about them. And he who said that poetic fancies, owing <lb/>
            to their vividness, were dreams of people awake, would <lb/>
            have more truly spoken so of the fancies of lovers, who, as <lb/>
            if their loves were present, converse with them, greet them, <lb/>
            chide them. For sight seems to paint all other fancies on <lb/>
            a wet ground, so soon do they fade and recede from the <lb/>
            memory, but the images of lovers, painted by the fancy as <lb/>
            it were on encaustic tiles, leave impressions on the memory, <lb/>
            that move, and live, and speak, and are permanent for all <lb/>
            time. The Roman Cato, indeed, said that the soul of the <lb/>
            lover resided in the soul of the loved one, and I should extend <lb/>
            the remark to the appearance, the character, the life, and the <lb/>
            actions, conducted by which he travels a long journey in a <lb/>
            short time, as the Cynics say they have found a short cut <lb/>
            and, as it were, forced march to virtue, for there is also a <lb/>
            short cut to friendship and love when the god is propitious. <lb/>
            To sum up, the enthusiasm of lovers is not a thing uninspired, <lb/>
            and the god that guides and governs it is none other than <lb/>
            the god whose festival we are now keeping, and to whom <lb/>
            we are now sacrificing. Nevertheless, as we judge of a god <lb/>
            mainly from his power and usefulness (as among human <lb/>
            advantages we reckon and call these two the most divine, <note type="footnote"> 1 " Iliad," vii. 121, 122. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Like the character described in Lucretius, ii. 1-6. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="49"/>
            dominion and virtue), it is high time to consider, before we <lb/>
            proceed any further, whether Love yields to any of the gods <lb/>
            in power. Certainly, as Sophocles says, ' Wonderful is <lb/>
            the power which the Cyprian Queen exerts so as always to <lb/>
            win the victory:'1 great also is the might of Ares; and in <lb/>
            some sort we see the power of all the other gods divided <lb/>
            among these two; for Aphrodite has most intimate con­ <lb/>
            nection with the beautiful, and Ares is in our souls from <lb/>
            the first to combat against the sordid, to borrow the idea <lb/>
            of Plato. Let us consider, then, to begin with, that the <lb/>
            venereal delight can be purchased for six obols, and that no <lb/>
            one ever yet put himself into any trouble or danger about <lb/>
            it, unless he was in love. And not to mention here such <lb/>
            famous courtesans as Phryne or Lais, Gnathænium,' kind­ <lb/>
            ling her lamp at evening time,' on the look-out for lovers <lb/>
            and inviting them, is often passed by; 'yet, if some sud­ <lb/>
            den whiff arise ' of mighty love and desire, it makes this <lb/>
            very delight seem equal to the fabled wealth of Tantalus <lb/>
            and his domains. So feeble and cloying is the venereal <lb/>
            indulgence, if Love inspires it not. And you will see this <lb/>
            more plainly still from the following consideration. Many <lb/>
            have allowed others to share in their venereal enjoyments, <lb/>
            prostituting not only their mistresses but their wives, like <lb/>
            that Roman Galba, who used to ask Mæcenas to dinner, <lb/>
            and when he saw from his nods and winks that he had a <lb/>
            mind to do with his wife, turned his head gently aside as <lb/>
            if asleep; but when one of his slaves came up to the table <lb/>
            and stole some wine, his eyes were wide open enough, and <lb/>
            he said, ' Villain, don't you know that I am asleep only for <lb/>
            Maecenas ? '2 But this is not perhaps so strange, consi­ <lb/>
            dering Galba was a buffoon. But at Argos Nicostratus <lb/>
            and Phayllus were great political rivals: so when King <lb/>
            Philip visited that city, Phayllus thought if he prostituted <lb/>
            his wife, who was very handsome, to the King, he would <lb/>
            get from him some important office or place. And Nicos­ <lb/>
            tratus getting wind of this, and walking about the doors of <lb/>
            Phayllus' house with some of his servants on the qui vive, <note type="footnote"> I Sophocles, " Tracbiniae," 497. The Cyprian Queen is, of course, <lb/>

             <pb n="50"/>
            Phayllus made his wife put on men's boots, and a military <lb/>
            cloak, and a Macedonian broad-brimmed bat, and so smug­ <lb/>
            gled her into the King, without being detected, as one of <lb/>
            the King's young men. But, of all the multitude of lovers, <lb/>
            did you ever hear of one that prostituted his boy-love even <lb/>
            for the honours of Zeus ?I think not. Why, though <lb/>
            no one will generally either speak or act against tyrants, <lb/>
            many will who find them their rivals and are jealous about <lb/>
            their handsome minions. You must have heard how <lb/>
            Aristogiton of Athens, and Antileon of Metapontum, and <lb/>
            Melanippus of Agrigentum, rose not against tyrants, <lb/>
            although they saw how badly they managed affairs, and <lb/>
            what drunken tricks they played, yet, when they attempted <lb/>
            the chastity of their boy-loves, they retaliated on them, <lb/>
            jeoparding their lives, as if they were defending the inviola­ <lb/>
            bility of temples and sanctuaries. It is also recorded that <lb/>
            Alexander wrote to Theodorus, the brother of Proteas, <lb/>
            ' Send me your singing-girl, unless you love her yourself, <lb/>
            and I will give you ten talents;' and when Antipatridas, <lb/>
            one of his companions, came to revel with him, bringing <lb/>
            with him a female harper, he fancied the girl not a little, <lb/>
            and asked Antipatridas if he cared very much about her. <lb/>
            And when he replied that he did immensely, Alexander <lb/>
            said, * Plague take you,' but nevertheless abstained from <lb/>
            touching the girl.</p>
          <p>§ xvii. " Consider also how Love excels in warlike feats, <lb/>
            and is by no means idle, as Euripides called him,1 nor a <lb/>
            carpet-knight, nor 'sleeping on a maiden's soft cheeks.'2 <lb/>
            For a man inspired by Love needs not Ares to help him <lb/>
            when he goes out as a warrior against the enemy, but at <lb/>
            the bidding of his own god is ' ready' for his friend ' to <lb/>
            go through fire and water and whirlwinds.' And in <lb/>
            Sophocles' play,3 when the sons of Niobe are being shot at <lb/>
            and dying, one of them calls out for no helper or assister <lb/>
            but his lover. And you know of course how it was that <lb/>
            Cleomachus the Pharsalian fell in battle ? " " We cer- <note type="footnote"> 1 Above, in § xiii. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 See Sophocles, " Antigone," 783, 784. And compare Horace, " Odes," <lb/>

            tainly don't," said Pemptides and those near him, " but we <lb/>
            should very much like to." " Well," said my father, " the <lb/>
            tale's worth hearing. When the war between the Eretrians <lb/>
            and Chalcidians was at its height, Cleomachus had come <lb/>
            to aid the latter with a Thessalian force; and the Chalcidian <lb/>
            infantry seemed strong enough, but they had great diffi­ <lb/>
            culty in repelling the enemy's cavalry. So they begged <lb/>
            that high-souled hero Cleomachus to charge the Eretrian <lb/>
            cavalry first. And he asked his boy-love, who was by, if <lb/>
            he would be a spectator of the fight, and he saying he <lb/>
            would, and affectionately kissing him and putting his <lb/>
            helmet on his head, Cleomachus with a proud joy put <lb/>
            himself at the head of the bravest of the Thessalians, and <lb/>
            charged the enemy's cavalry with such impetuosity that he <lb/>
            threw them into disorder and routed them; and the Eretrian <lb/>
            infantry also fleeing in consequence, the Chalcidians won a <lb/>
            splendid victory. However, Cleomachus got killed, and <lb/>
            they show his tomb in the market-place at Chalets, over <lb/>
            which a huge pillar stands to this day, and whereas before <lb/>
            that the people of Chalcis had censured boy-loves, from <lb/>
            that time forward they preferred that kind of love to the <lb/>
            normal love. Aristotle gives a slightly different account, <lb/>
            namely, that this Cleomachus came not from Thessaly, but <lb/>
            from Chalcis in Thrace, to the help of the Chalcidians in <lb/>
            Eubcea; and that that was the origin of the song in vogue <lb/>
            among the Chalcidians, <lb/>
            'Ye boys, who come of noble sires and beauteous are in face, <lb/>
            Grudge not to give to valiant men the joy of your embrace : <lb/>
            For Love that does the limbs relax combined with bravery <lb/>
            In the Chalcidian cities has fame that ne'er shall die.' <lb/>
            But according to the account of the poet Dionysius, in his <lb/>
            ' Causes,'1 the name of the lover was Anton, and that of the <lb/>
            boy-love was PhiHstus. And among you Thebans, Pemp­ <lb/>
            tides, is it not usual for the lover to give his boy-love a com­ <lb/>
            plete suit of armour when he is enrolled among the men ? <lb/>
            And did not the erotic Pammenes change the disposition of <lb/>
            the heavy-armed infantry, censuring Homer as knowing <lb/>
            nothing about love, because he drew up the Achaeans in <note type="footnote"> 1 This was the name of Dionysius' Poem. He was a Corinthian poet. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="52"/>
            order of battle in tribes and clans, and did not put lover <lb/>
            and love together, that so <lb/>
            ' Spear should be next to spear, helmet to helmet,'1 <lb/>
            seeing that Love is the only invincible general.2 For men <lb/>
            in battle will leave in the lurch clansmen and friends, aye, <lb/>
            and parents and sons, but what warrior ever broke through <lb/>
            or charged through lover and love, seeing that even when <lb/>
            there is no necessity lovers frequently display their bravery <lb/>
            and contempt of life. As There the Thessalian, who put <lb/>
            his left hand on a wall, and drew his sword, and chopped <lb/>
            off his thumb, and challenged his rival to do the same. <lb/>
            And another in battle falling on his face, as his enemy <lb/>
            was about to give him the coup-de-grace, begged him to <lb/>
            wait a little till he could turn round, that his love should <lb/>
            not see him with a wound in his back. And not only are <lb/>
            the most warlike nations most amorous, as the Bœotians <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians and the Cretans, but also of the old <lb/>
            heroes, who were more amorous than Meleager, Achilles, <lb/>
            Aristomenes, Cimon, and Epaminondas. Why, Epaminon­ <lb/>
            das had as his boy-loves Asopichus and Cephisodorus, the <lb/>
            latter of whom fell with him at Mantinea, and is buried <lb/>
            near him. As to , who was most formidable and a <lb/>
            source of terror to the enemy, Eucnamus of Amphissa, <lb/>
            who first stood up against him and smote him, received <lb/>
            hero honours from the Phocians for his exploit. And as <lb/>
            to all the loves of Hercules, it would take up too much time <lb/>
            to enumerate them, but those who think that Iolaus was <lb/>
            one of them do up to this day worship and honour him, and <lb/>
            make their loves swear fidelity at his tomb. Hercules is <lb/>
            also said, having understood the art of healing, to have <lb/>
            preserved the life of Alcestis, when she was given up by the <lb/>

            though women have not much of Ares in them, yet when <lb/>
            possessed by Love they are bold even to the death, beyond <lb/>
            what one would expect from their nature. For if we may <lb/>
            credit legendary lore, the stories about Alcestis, and <lb/>
            Protesilaus, and Eurydice the wife of Orpheus, show that <lb/>
            the only one of the gods that Hades pays attention to is <lb/>
            Love ; although to everybody else, as Sophocles says, " he <lb/>
            knows of no forbearance or favour, or anything but strict <lb/>
            justice; " yet before lovers his genius stands rebuked, and <lb/>
            they alone find him neither implacable nor relentless. <lb/>
            Wherefore although, my friend, it is an excellent thing to <lb/>
            be initiated in the Eleusinian mysteries, yet I see that the <lb/>
            votaries and initiated of Love have a better time of it in <lb/>
            Hades than they have, * * 1 though in regard to legendary <lb/>
            lore I stand in the position of one who neither altogether <lb/>
            believes nor altogether disbelieves. For legendary lore <lb/>
            speaks well, and by a certain wonderful good fortune lights <lb/>
            upon the truth, in saying that lovers have a return from <lb/>
            Hades to the light of day, but it knows not by what way <lb/>
            or how, having as it were got benighted on the road which <lb/>
            Plato first discovered by philosophy. There are, indeed, <lb/>
            some slender and obscure particles of truth scattered about <lb/>
            in the mythology of the Egyptians, but they require a <lb/>
            clever man to hunt them out, a man capable of getting <lb/>
            great results from small data. Wherefore let that matter <lb/>
            pass. And now next to the mighty power of Love let us <lb/>
            consider its good will and favour to mankind, I do not <lb/>
            mean as to whether it bestows many gifts on its votaries­ <lb/>
            that is palpable to all-but whether they derive any fur­ <lb/>
            ther advantage from it. For Euripides, though very <lb/>
            amorous, admired a very small matter, when he wrote the <lb/>
            line­ <lb/>
            e Love teaches letters to a man unlearn'd.'2 <lb/>
            For it makes one previously sluggish quick and intelligent, <lb/>
            and, as has been said before, it makes the coward brave, as <lb/>
            people harden wood in the fire and make it strong from <lb/>
            being weak. And every lover becomes liberal and genuine <note type="footnote"> 1 Something has probably dropped out here, as Diibner suspects. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Fragment from the " Sthenebcea " of Euripides. </note> <lb/>

            and generous, even if he was mean before, his littleness <lb/>
            and miserliness melting away like iron in the fire, so that <lb/>
            they rejoice to give to their loves more than they do to <lb/>
            receive themselves from others. You know of course that <lb/>
            Anytus, the son of Anthemion, was in love with Alcibiades, <lb/>
            and was on one occasion sumptuously entertaining several <lb/>
            of his friends, when Alcibiades broke in and took from the <lb/>
            table half the cups and went away again ; and when some <lb/>
            of the guests were indignant and said, ‛The stripling has <lb/>
            used you most insolently and contemptuously,' Anytus <lb/>
            replied, 'Nay, rather, he has dealt kindly with me, for <lb/>
            when he might have taken all he has left me half.' "</p>
          <p>§ XVIII. Zeuxippus was pleased with this story, and said, <lb/>
            " 0 Hercules, you have been within an ace of making me <lb/>
            forget my hereditary hatred to Anytus for his behaviour to <lb/>
            Socrates and philosophy,1 since he was so mild and noble <lb/>
            to his love." " Be it so," said my father, " Love also <lb/>
            makes peevish and gloomy persons kind and agreeable to <lb/>
            those they live with ; for as ‛when the fire blazes the house <lb/>
            looks brighter,'2 so man, it seems, becomes more cheerful <lb/>
            through the beat of love. But most people are affected <lb/>
            rather curiously; if they see by night a light in a house, <lb/>
            they look on it with admiration and wonder ; but if they <lb/>
            see a little, mean, and ignoble soul suddenly filled with <lb/>
            noble-mindedness, freedom, dignity, grace, and liberality, <lb/>
            they do not feel constrained to say with Telemachus,' Surely, <lb/>
            some god is there within.’3 And is it not wonderful, <lb/>
            Daphnæus,” continued my father,' " in the name of the <lb/>
            Graces, that the lover who cares about hardly anything, <lb/>
            either his companions and friends, or even the laws and <lb/>
            magistrates and kings, who fears nothing, admires nothing, <lb/>
            courts nothing, but can even endure to gaze on ‛the forked <lb/>
            lightnjng,’5 yet directly he looks on his love he crouches <lb/>
            like a cock with drooping feathers,' and his boldness is <note type="footnote"> 1 Anytus was one of the accusers of Socrates, and so one of the causers <lb/>

            broken and his pride is cowed. And among the Muses <lb/>
            it would not be amiss to mention Sappho ; for as the <lb/>
            Romans say Cacus the son of Hephæstus vomited out of <lb/>
            his mouth fire and flames, so she really speaks words that <lb/>
            burn like fire, and in her songs shows the warmth of her <lb/>
            heart, as Philoxenus puts it, 4 by euphonious songs assuag­ <lb/>
            ing the pains of love.' And if you have not in your love <lb/>
            for Lysandra forgot all your old love-songs, do repeat to <lb/>
            us, Daphnæus, the lines in which beautiful Sappho says <lb/>
            that 4 when her love appeared her voice failed and her body <lb/>
            burned, and she was seized with paleness and trembling <lb/>
            and vertigo.' " And when Daphnæus had repeated the <lb/>
            lines, my father resumed, “In the name of Zeus, is not <lb/>
            this plainly a divine seizure P Is not this a wonderful com­ <lb/>
            motion of soul ? Why, the Pythian priestess on the tripod <lb/>
            is not moved so much as this ! Who of those inspired by <lb/>
            Cybele are made beside themselves to this extent by the flute <lb/>
            and the kettledrum ? Moreover, while many see the same <lb/>
            body and the same beauty, only the lover is taken by it. <lb/>
            Why is this the case? We get no light on it from <lb/>
            Menander's words, ‘Love is opportunity; and he that is <lb/>
            smitten is the only one wounded.' But the god is the <lb/>
            cause of it, striking one and letting another go scot-free. <lb/>
            But I will not pass over now, 4 since it has come into my <lb/>
            mouth,' as Æschylus says, what perhaps would have been <lb/>
            better spoken before, for it is a very important point. <lb/>
            Perhaps, my friend, of all other things which we do not <lb/>
            perceive through the senses, some got believed through <lb/>
            legend, some through the law, some through reason ; <lb/>
            whereas we owe our conception of the gods altogether to <lb/>
            the poets and legislators and philosophers: all alike teach­ <lb/>
            ing the existence of gods, but greatly differing as to their <lb/>
            number and order, nature and power. For the gods of the <lb/>
            philosophers ‘know nothing of disease or old age or pain, <lb/>
            and have not to cross the resounding Acheron;' nor do <lb/>
            the philosophers accept as gods Strifes, or Prayers, which are <lb/>
            found in poetry;1 nor will they admit Terror and Fear as <lb/>
            gods or as the sons of Ares. And on many points also they <lb/>
            are at variance with the legislators, as Xenophanes bade the <note type="footnote"> 1 See fur example Homer, Iliad, xi. 3, 73; ix. 502. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="56"/>
            Egyptians, if they regarded Osiris as mortal, not to honour <lb/>
            him as a god ; but if they thought him a god not to mourn <lb/>
            for him. And, again, the poets and legislators will not <lb/>
            listen to, nor can they understand, the philosophers who <lb/>
            make gods of ideas and numbers and units and spirits. <lb/>
            And their views generally are very different. As there were <lb/>
            formerly three parties at Athens, the Parali, the Epacrii, <lb/>
            and the Pediei, all at variance with one another, yet all <lb/>
            agreed to vote for Solon, and chose him with one accord as <lb/>
            their mediator and ruler and lawgiver, as he seemed indis­ <lb/>
            putably to hold the first place in merit; so the three parties <lb/>
            that entertain different views about the gods are all unani­ <lb/>
            mous on one point, for poets legislators and philosophers all <lb/>
            alike register Love as one of the gods, loudly singing his <lb/>
            praises with one voice,' as Alcæus says the people of <lb/>
            Mitylene chose Pittacus as their monarch. But our king <lb/>
            and ruler and governor, Love, is brought down crowned <lb/>
            from Helicon to the Academy by Hesiod and Plato and <lb/>
            Solon, and in royal apparel rides in a chariot drawn by <lb/>
            friendship and intimacy (not such as Euripides speaks of <lb/>
            in the line, 'he has been bound in fetters not of brass,’1 <lb/>
            shamefully throwing round him cold and heavy necessity), <lb/>
            and soars aloft to the most beautiful and divine things, <lb/>
            about which others have spoken better than I can."</p>
          <p>§ xix. When my father had spoken thus much, Soclarus <lb/>
            began, " Do you see that a second time you have committed <lb/>
            the same fault, not cancelling your debts as you ought to do <lb/>
            -for I must speak my mind-but evading them on purpose, <lb/>
            and not delivering to us your promised ideas on a sacred <lb/>
            subject ? For as some little time back you only just <lb/>
            touched on Plato and the Egyptians as if unwilling to enter <lb/>
            on the subject more fully, so now you are doing again. <lb/>
            However, as to what has been 1 eloquently told '2 by Plato, <lb/>
            or rather by the Muses through Plato's mouth, do not tell <lb/>
            us that, my good friend, even if we ask for it; but as to <lb/>
            your hint that the Egyptian legend about Love corre­ <lb/>
            sponded with Plato's views, you need not discuss it fully <lb/>
            and minutely, we shall be satisfied if we hear a little of <note type="footnote"> 1 Euripides, " Pirithong,” Fragm. 591. Dindorf. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 An allusion to Humer, " Odyssey," xii. 453. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="57"/>
            such mighty matters." And as the rest of the company <lb/>
            made the same request, my father said, “The Egyptians, <lb/>
            (like the Greeks) recognize two Loves, the Pandemian and <lb/>
            the Celestial, to which they add the Sun, they also highly <lb/>
            venerate Aphrodite. We also see much similarity between <lb/>
            Love and the Sun, for neither is a fire, as some think, but <lb/>
            a sweet and productive radiance and warmth, the Sun <lb/>
            bringing to the body nourishment and light and growth, <lb/>
            and Love doing the same to the soul. And as the heat of <lb/>
            the Sun is more powerful when it emerges from clouds and <lb/>
            after mist, so Love is sweeter and hotter after a jealous tiff <lb/>
            with the loved one,1 and moreover, as some think the Sun <lb/>
            is kindled and extinguished, so also do people conceive of <lb/>
            Love as mortal and uncertain. Moreover, just as without <lb/>
            training the body cannot easily bear the heat of the Sun, so <lb/>
            neither can the untrained soul easily bear the yoke of <lb/>
            Love, but both are equally out of tune and suffer, for which <lb/>
            they blame the deity and not their own weakness. But in <lb/>
            this respect they seem to differ, in that the Sun exhibits to <lb/>
            the eye things beautiful and ugly alike, whereas Love throws <lb/>
            its light only on beautiful things, and persuades lovers to <lb/>
            concentrate their attention on these, and to neglect all <lb/>
            other things. As to those that call Aphrodite the Moon, <lb/>
            they, too, find some points in common between them; for <lb/>
            the Moon is divine and heavenly and a sort of halfway­ <lb/>
            house between mortal and immortal, but inactive in itself <lb/>
            and dark without the presence of the Sun, as is the case <lb/>
            with Aphrodite in the absence of Love. So we may say <lb/>
            that Aphrodite resembles the Moon, and Love the Sun, <lb/>
            more than any other deities, yet are not Love and the Sun <lb/>
            altogether the same, for just as body and soul are not the <lb/>
            same, but something different, so is it with the Sun and <lb/>
            Love, the former can be seen, the latter only felt. And if <lb/>
            it should not seem too harsh a saying, one might argue <lb/>
            that the Sun acts entirely opposite to Love, for it turns <lb/>
            the mind away from the world of fancy to the world of <lb/>
            reality, beguiling us by its grace and splendid appearance, <lb/>
            and persuading us to seek for truth and everything else in <lb/>
            and round it and nowhere else. For as Euripides says, <note type="footnote"> 1 So Terence, " Andria," 555. “Amantium iræ amoris integratiost.” </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="58"/>
            ‘Too passionately do we love the Sun, <lb/>
            Because it always shines upon the earth, <lb/>
            From inexperience of another life,’1 <lb/>
            or rather from forgetfulness of those things which Love <lb/>
            brings to our remembrance. For as when we are woke by <lb/>
            a great and bright light, everything that the soul has seen <lb/>
            in dreams is vanished and fled, so the Sun is wont to banish <lb/>
            the remembrance of past changes and chances, and to be­ <lb/>
            witch the intelligence, pleasure and admiration causing <lb/>
            this forgetfulness. And though reality is really there, yet <lb/>
            the soul cleaves to dreams and is dazzled by what is most <lb/>
            beautiful and divine. ‘For round the soul are poured <lb/>
            sweet yet deceiving dreams,' so th it the soul thinks every­ <lb/>
            thing here good and valuable, unless it obtain divine and <lb/>
            chaste Love as its physician and preserver. For Love <lb/>
            brings the soul through the body to truth and the region <lb/>
            of truth, where pure and guileless beauty is to be found, <lb/>
            kindly befriending its votaries like an initiator at the <lb/>
            mysteries. And it associates with the soul only through the <lb/>
            body. And as geometricians, in the case of boys who can­ <lb/>
            not yet be initiated into the perception of incorporeal and <lb/>
            impassive substance, convey their ideas through the medium <lb/>
            of spheres, cubes, and dodecahedrons, so celestial Love has <lb/>
            contrived beautiful mirrors of beautiful things, and ex­ <lb/>
            hibits them to us glittering in the shapes colours and <lb/>
            appearances of youths in all their flower, and calmly stirs <lb/>
            the memory which is inflamed first by these. Consequently <lb/>
            some, through the stupidity of their friends and intimates, <lb/>
            who have endeavoured by force and against reason to ex­ <lb/>
            tinguish the flame, have got no advantage from it, but <lb/>
            filled themselves with smoke and confusion, or have rushed <lb/>
            into secret and lawless pleasures and ingloriously wasted <lb/>
            their prime. But as many as by sober reason and modesty <lb/>
            have abated the extravagance of the passion, and left in <lb/>
            the soul only a bright glow-not exciting a tornado of pas­ <lb/>
            sion, but a wonderful and productive diffusion, as in a <lb/>
            growing plant, opening the pores of complaisance and <lb/>
            friendliness—these in no long time cease to regard the per­ <lb/>
            sonal charms of those they love, and study their inward <note type="footnote"> 1 Euripides, H ppolytus,” 194-196. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="59"/>
            characters, and gaze at one another with unveiled eyes, and <lb/>
            associate with one another in words and actions, if they <lb/>
            find in their minds any fragment or image of the beautiful; <lb/>
            and if not they bid them farewell and turn to others, like <lb/>
            bees that only go to those flowers from which they can get <lb/>
            honey. But wherever they find any trace or emanation <lb/>
            or pleasing resemblance of the divine, in an ecstasy of <lb/>
            pleasure and delight they indulge their memory, and revive <lb/>
            to whatever is truly lovely and felicitous and admired by <lb/>
            everybody."</p>
          <p>§ xx. “The poets indeed seem for the most part to have <lb/>
            written and sung about Love in a playful and merry manner, <lb/>
            but have sometimes spoken seriously about him, whether <lb/>
            out of their own mind, or the god helping them to truth. <lb/>
            Among these are the lines about his birth, ‘Well-sandalled <lb/>
            Iris bare the most powerful of the gods to golden-haired <lb/>
            Zephyr.’1 But perhaps the learned have persuaded <lb/>
            you that these lines are only a fanciful illustration of the <lb/>
            variety and beauty of love." " Certainly," said Daphnæus, <lb/>
            “what else could they mean ? " " Hear me," said my <lb/>
            father, " for the heavenly phenomenon compels us so to <lb/>
            speak. The rainbow2 is, I suppose, a reflection caused <lb/>
            by the sun's rays falling on a moist cloud, making us think <lb/>
            the appearance is in the cloud. Similarly erotic fancy in <lb/>
            the case of noble souls causes a reflection of the memory, <lb/>
            from things which here appear and are called beautiful, to <lb/>
            what is really divine and lovely and felicitous and wonder­ <lb/>
            ful. But most lovers pursuing and groping after the <lb/>
            semblance of beauty in boys and women, as in mirrors,3 can <lb/>
            derive nothing more certain than pleasure mixed with <lb/>
            pain. And this seems the love-delirium of Ixion, who <lb/>
            instead of the joy he desired embraced only a cloud, as <lb/>

            haviour of the noble and chaste lover: for he reflects on <lb/>
            the divine beauty that can only be felt, while he uses the <lb/>
            beauty of the visible body only as an organ of the memory, <lb/>
            though he embraces it and loves it, and associating with it <lb/>
            is still more inflamed in mind. And so neither in the body <lb/>
            do they sit ever gazing at and desiring this light, nor after <lb/>
            death do they return to this world again, and skulk and <lb/>
            loiter about the doors and bedchambers of newly-married <lb/>
            people, disagreeable ghosts of pleasure-loving and sensual <lb/>
            men and women, who do not rightly deserve the name of <lb/>
            lovers. For the true lover, when he has got into the other <lb/>
            world and associated with beauties as much as is lawful, <lb/>
            has wings and is initiated and passes his time above in the <lb/>
            presence of his Deity, dancing and waiting upon him, until <lb/>
            he goes back to the meadows of the Moon and Aphrodite, <lb/>
            and sleeping there commences a new existence. But this <lb/>
            is a subject too high for the present occasion. However, it <lb/>
            is with Love as with the other gods, to borrow the words <lb/>
            of Euripides, ' he rejoices in being honoured by mankind,’1 <lb/>
            and vice versa, for be is most propitious to those that <lb/>
            receive him properly, but visits his displeasure on those <lb/>
            that affront him. For neither does Zeus as god of Hospi­ <lb/>
            tality punish and avenge any outrages on strangers or sup­ <lb/>
            pliants, nor as god of the family fulfil the curses of parents, <lb/>
            as quickly as Love hearkens to lovers unfairly treated, <lb/>
            being the chastiser of boorish and haughty persons. Why <lb/>
            need I mention the story of Euxynthetus and Leucomantis, <lb/>
            the latter of whom is called The Peeping Girl to this day <lb/>
            in Cyprus ? But perhaps you have not heard of the <lb/>
            punishment of the Cretan Gorge, a somewhat similar case <lb/>
            to that of Leucomantis, except that she was turned into <lb/>
            stone as she peeped out of window to see her lover carried <lb/>
            out to burial. For this Gorge had a lover called Asander, <lb/>
            a proper young man and of a good family, but reduced in <lb/>
            fortune, though he thought himself worthy to mate with <lb/>
            anybody. So he wooed Gorge, being a relation of hers, <lb/>
            and though he bad many rivals, as she was much run after <lb/>
            for her wealth belike, yet he had won the esteem of all the <lb/>
            guardians and relations of the young girl.2 * * * * <note type="footnote"> 1 See Euripides, " Hippolytus,” 7, 8. </note><note type="footnote">2 Here the story unfurtunately ends. and for all time we shall know </note> <pb n="61"/>

          <p>§ xxi. * * * Now the origins and causes of Love are not <lb/>
            peculiar to either sex, but common to both. For those <lb/>
            attractions that make men amorous may as well proceed <lb/>
            from women as from boys.1 And as to those beautiful and <lb/>
            holy reminiscences and invitations to the divine and <lb/>
            genuine and Olympian beauty, by which the soul soars <lb/>
            aloft, what hinders but that they may come either from <lb/>
            boys or lads, maidens or grown women, whenever a chaste <lb/>
            and orderly nature and beauteous prime are associated <lb/>
            together (just as a neat shoe exhibits the shapeliness of <lb/>
            the foot, to borrow the illustration of Aristo), whenever <lb/>
            connoisseurs of beauty descry in beautiful forms and pure <lb/>
            bodies clear traces of an upright and unenervated soul.2 For <lb/>
            if3 the man of pleasure, who was asked whether " he was <lb/>
            most given to the love of women or boys," and answered, <lb/>
            " I care not which so beauty be but there," is considered <lb/>
            to have given an appropriate answer as to his erotic <lb/>
            desires, shall the noble lover of beauty neglect beauty and <lb/>
            nobility of nature, and make love only with an eye to the <lb/>
            sexual parts ? Why, the lover of horses will take just as <lb/>
            much pleasure in the good points of Podargus, as in those <lb/>
            of Æthe, Agamemnon's mare,4 and the sportsman rejoices <lb/>
            not only in dogs, but also rears Cretan and Spartan bitches,5 <lb/>
            and shall the lover of the beautiful and of humanity be <lb/>
            unfair and deal unequally with either sex, and think that <lb/>
            the difference between the loves of boys and women is <lb/>
            only their different dress? And yet they say that beauty <lb/>
            is a flower of virtue5 and it is ridiculous to assert that the <lb/>
            female sex never blossoms nor make a goodly show of virtue, <lb/>
            for as AEschylus truly says, <lb/>
            ‘I never can mistake the burning eye <lb/>
            Of the young woman that has once known man.’8 <lb/>
            Shall the indications then of a forward wanton and corrupt <note type="footnote"> no more of it. Reiske somewhat forcibly says, “Vel lippus videat <lb/>

            character be found in the faces of women, and shall there <lb/>
            be no gleam of chastity and modesty in their appearance? <lb/>
            Nay, there are many such, and shall they not move and <lb/>
            provoke love ? To doubt it would be neither sensible nor <lb/>
            in accordance with the facts, for generally speaking, as has <lb/>
            been pointed out, all these attractions are the same in both <lb/>
            sexes ... But, Daphnæus, let us combat those views <lb/>
            which Zeuxippus lately advanced, making Love to be only <lb/>
            irregular desire carrying the soul away to licentiousness, <lb/>
            not that this was so much his own view as what he had often <lb/>
            beard from morose men who knew nothing of love : some <lb/>
            of whom marry unfortunate women for their dowries, and <lb/>
            force on them economy and illiberal saving, and quarrel <lb/>
            with them every day of their lives: while others, more <lb/>
            desirous of children than wives, when they have made <lb/>
            those women they come across mothers, bid farewell to mar­ <lb/>
            riage, or regard it not at all, and neither care to love nor <lb/>
            be loved. Now the fact that the word for conjugal lovo <lb/>
            differs only by one letter from the word for endurance, <lb/>
            the one being <foreign xml:lang="grc">στέργειν</foreign> the other <foreign xml:lang="grc">στέγειν</foreign>, seems to empha­ <lb/>
            size the conjugal kindness mixed by time and intimacy <lb/>
            with necessity. But that marriage which Love has inspired <lb/>
            will in the first place, as in Plato's Republic, know <lb/>
            nothing of Meum and Tuum, for the proverb, 4 whatever <lb/>
            belongs to a friend is common property,’1 is especially <lb/>
            true of married persons who, though disunited in body, <lb/>
            are perforce one in soul, neither wishing to be two, nor <lb/>
            thinking themselves so. In the second place there will be <lb/>
            mutual respect, which is a vital necessity in marriage. For as <lb/>
            to that external respect which has in it more of compulsion <lb/>
            than choice, being forced by the law and shame and fear, <lb/>
            “Those needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds,” 2 <lb/>
            that will always exist in wedlock. But in Love there is <lb/>
            such self-control and decorum and constancy, that if the <lb/>
            god but once enter the soul of a licentious man, he makes <lb/>
            him give up all his amours, abates his pride, and breaks <lb/>
            down his haughtiness and dissoluteness, putting in their <lb/>
            place modesty and silence and tranquillity and decorum, <note type="footnote">1 A very favourite proverb among the ancients. See Plat. " Phaedr." <lb/>

             <pb n="63"/>
            and makes him constant to one. You have heard of course <lb/>
            of the famous courtesan Lais,1 how she set all Greece on <lb/>
            fire with her charms, or rather was contended for by two <lb/>
            seas,2 and how, when she fell in love with Hippolochus the <lb/>
            Thessalian, ‘she left Acro-Corinthus washed by the green <lb/>
            sea,’3 and deserted all her other lovers, that great army, <lb/>
            and went off to Thessaly and lived faithful to Hippo­ <lb/>
            lochus. But the women there, envious and jealous of her <lb/>
            for her surpassing beauty, dragged her into the temple of <lb/>
            Aphrodite, and there stoned her to death, for which reason <lb/>
            probably it is called to this day the temple of Aphrodite <lb/>
            the Murderess.' We have also heard of servant girls who <lb/>
            have refused the embraces of their masters, and of private <lb/>
            individuals who have scorned an amour with queens, when <lb/>
            Love has had dominion in their hearts. For as in Rome, <lb/>
            when a dictator is proclaimed, all other magistrates lay <lb/>
            down their offices, so those over whom Love is lord are free <lb/>
            henceforward from all other lords and masters, and pass <lb/>
            the rest of their lives dedicate to the god and slaves in his <lb/>
            temple. For a noble woman united by Love to her lawful <lb/>
            husband would prefer the embraces of bears and dragons to <lb/>
            those of any other man."</p>
          <p>§ XXII. "Although there are plenty of examples of this <lb/>
            virtue of constancy, yet to you, that are the festive votaries <lb/>
            of the god,5 it will not be amiss to relate the story of the <lb/>
            Galatian Gamma. She was a woman of most remarkable <lb/>
            beauty, and the wife of the tetrarch Sinatus, whom <lb/>
            Sinorix, one of the most influential men in Galatia, and <lb/>
            desperately in love with Gamma, murdered, as he could <lb/>
            neither get her by force or persuasion in the lifetime of her <lb/>
            husband. And Gamma found a refuge and comfort in her <lb/>
            grief in discharging the functions of hereditary priestess <lb/>
            to Artemis, and most of her time she spent in her temple, <note type="footnote"> 1 On Lais, see Pausanias, ii. 2. Her Thessalian lover is there called <lb/>
            Hippostratus. Her favours were so costly that the famous proverb is <lb/>

            Corinthum." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The Ægean and Ionian. Cf. Horace, “Odes," i. 7, 2. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 On Acro-Corinthus, see Pausanias, ii. 4. The words in inverted <lb/>

             <pb n="64"/>
            and, though many kings and potentates wooed her, she <lb/>
            refused them all. But when Sinorix boldly proposed <lb/>
            marriage to her, she declined not his offer, nor blamed him <lb/>
            for what he had done, as though she thought he had only <lb/>
            murdered Sinatus out of excessive love for her, and not in <lb/>
            sheer villany. He came, therefore, with confidence, and <lb/>
            asked her hand, and she met him and greeted him and led <lb/>
            him to the altar of the goddess, and pledged him in a cup <lb/>
            of poisoned mead, drinking half of it herself and giving <lb/>
            him the rest. And when she saw that he had drunk it up, <lb/>
            she shouted aloud for joy, and calling upon the name of <lb/>
            her dead husband, said, ' Till this day, dearest husband, I <lb/>
            have lived, deprived of you, a life of sorrow: but now take <lb/>
            me to yourself with joy, for I have avenged you on the <lb/>
            worst of men, as glad to share death with him as life with <lb/>
            you.' Then Sinorix was removed out of the temple on a <lb/>
            litter, and soon after gave up the ghost, and Camma lived <lb/>
            the rest of that day and following night, and is said to have <lb/>
            died with a good courage and even with gaiety."1</p>
          <p>§ XXIII. "As many similar examples might be adduced, <lb/>
            both among ourselves and foreigners, who can feel any <lb/>
            patience with those that reproach Aphrodite with hinder­ <lb/>
            ing friendship when she associates herself with Love as a <lb/>
            partner? Whereas any reflecting person would call the <lb/>
            love of boys wanton and gross lasciviousness, and say with <lb/>
            the poet: <lb/>
            ' This is an outrage, not an act of love.' <lb/>
            All willing pathics, therefore, we consider the vilest of man­ <lb/>
            kind, and credit them with neither fidelity, nor modesty, <lb/>
            nor friendship, for as Sophocles says: <lb/>
            ‘Those who shall lose such friends may well be glad, <lb/>
            And those who have such pray that they may lose them.’2</p>
          <p>But as for those who, not being by nature vicious, have <lb/>
            been seduced or forced, they are apt all their life to despise <lb/>
            and hate their seducers, and when an opportunity has <lb/>
            presented itself to take fierce vengeance. As Crateus, <lb/>

            Alexander of Pherme. And Periander, the tyrant of the <lb/>
            Ambraciotes, having asked a most insulting question of his <lb/>
            minion, was murdered by him, so exasperated was he. <lb/>
            But with women and wives all this is the beginning of <lb/>
            friendship, and as it were an initiation into the sacred <lb/>
            mysteries. And pleasure plays a very small part in this, <lb/>
            but the esteem and favour and mutual love and constancy <lb/>
            that result from it, proves that the Delphians did not talk <lb/>
            nonsense in giving the name of Arma1 to Aphrodite, nor <lb/>
            Homer in giving the name of friendship2 to sexual love, <lb/>
            and testifies to the fact that Solon was a most experienced <lb/>
            legislator in conjugal matters, seeing that he ordered <lb/>
            husbands not less than thrice a month to associate with <lb/>
            their wives, not for pleasure, but as states at certain <lb/>
            intervals renew their treaties with one another, so he wished <lb/>
            that by such friendliness marriage should, as it were, be <lb/>
            renewed after any intervening tiffs and differences. But <lb/>
            you will tell me there is much folly and even madness in <lb/>
            the love of women. Is there not more extravagance in the <lb/>
            love of boys ? <lb/>
            ‘Seeing my many rivals I grow faint. <lb/>
            The lad is beardless, smooth and soft and handsome, <lb/>
            O that I might in his embraces die, <lb/>
            And have the fact recorded on my tomb.' <lb/>
            Such extravagant language as this is madness not love. <lb/>
            And it is absurd to detract from woman's various ex­ <lb/>
            cellence. Look at their self-restraint and intelligence, <lb/>
            their fidelity and uprightness, and that bravery courage <lb/>
            and magnanimity so conspicuous in many! And to say <lb/>
            that they have a natural aptitude for all other virtues, but <lb/>
            are deficient as regards friendship alone, is monstrous. <lb/>
            For they are fond of their children and husbands, and <lb/>
            generally speaking the natural affection in them is not <lb/>
            only, like a fruitful soil, capable of friendship, but is also <lb/>
            accompanied by persuasion and other graces. And as <lb/>
            poetry gives to words a kind of relish by melody and <lb/>
            metre and rhythm, making instruction thereby more in­ <lb/>
            teresting, but what is injurious more insidious, so nature, <note type="footnote"> I A Delphic word for love. Can it be connected with <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄρμα</foreign> ? </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Very frequent in Homer, e.g., “Iliad," ii. 232; vi. 165 3 xiii. 636; <lb/>

            investing woman with beautiful appearance and attractive <lb/>
            voice and bewitching figure, does much for a licentious <lb/>
            woman in making her wiles more formidable, but makes a <lb/>
            modest one more apt thereby to win the goodwill and <lb/>
            friendship of her husband. And as Plato advised Xeno­ <lb/>
            crates, a great and noble man in all other respects, but too <lb/>
            austere in his temperament, to sacrifice to the Graces, so <lb/>
            one might recommend a good and modest woman to <lb/>
            sacrifice to Love, that her husband might be a mild and <lb/>
            agreeable partner, and not run after any other woman, so <lb/>
            as to be compelled to say like the fellow in the comedy, <lb/>
            ' What a wretch I am to ill-treat such a woman!' For <lb/>
            to love in marriage is far better than to be loved, for it <lb/>
            prevents many, Day all, of those offences which spoil and <lb/>
            mar marriage.</p>
          <p>§ xxiv. As to the passionate affection in the early days <lb/>
            of marriage,1 my dear Zeuxippus, do not fear that it will <lb/>
            leave any sore or irritation, though it is not wonderful that <lb/>
            there should be some friction at the commencement of <lb/>
            union with a virtuous woman, just as at the grafting of <lb/>
            trees, as there is also pain at the beginning of conception, <lb/>
            for there can be no complete union without some suffering. <lb/>
            Learning puts boys out somewhat when they first go to <lb/>
            school, as philosophy does young men at a later day, but <lb/>
            the ill effects are not lasting, either in their cases or in the <lb/>
            case of lovers. As in the fusion of two liquors, love does <lb/>
            indeed at first cause a simmering and commotion, but <lb/>
            eventually cools down and settles and becomes tranquil. <lb/>
            For the union of lovers is indeed a complete union, whereas <lb/>
            the union of those that live together without love resembles <lb/>
            only the friction and concussion of Epicurus' atoms in <lb/>
            collision and recoil, forming no such union as Love <lb/>
            makes, when he presides over the conjugal state. For <lb/>
            nothing else produces so much pleasure, or such lasting <lb/>
            advantages, or such beautiful remarkable and desirable <lb/>
            friendship, <lb/>
            ' As when husband and wife live in one house, <lb/>
            Two souls beating as one.’2 <lb/>
            And the law gives its countenance, and nature shows that <note type="footnote"> 1 See Lucretius, iv. 1105-1114. I tone down the original here a little. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Homer, " Odyssey," vi. 183, 184. Of. Eurip. “Medea,” 14, 15. </note> <lb/>

            even the gods themselves require love for the production <lb/>
            of everything. Thus the poets tell as that ‘the earth loves <lb/>
            a shower, and heaven loves the earth,' and the natural <lb/>
            philosophers tell us that the sun is in love with the moon, <lb/>
            and that they are husband and wife, and that the earth is <lb/>
            the mother of man and beast and the producer of all <lb/>
            plants. Would not the world itself then of necessity come <lb/>
            to an end, if the great god Love and the desires implanted <lb/>
            by the god should leave matter, and matter should cease <lb/>
            to yearn for and pursue its lead ? But not to seem to <lb/>
            wander too far away and altogether to trifle, you know <lb/>
            that many censure boy-loves for their instability, and <lb/>
            jeeringly say that that intimacy like an egg is destroyed <lb/>
            by a hair,1 for that boy-lovers like Nomads, spending <lb/>
            the summer in a blooming and flowery country, at once <lb/>
            decamp then as from an enemy's territory. And still more <lb/>
            vulgarly Bion the Sophist called the sprouting beards of <lb/>
            beautiful boys Harmodiuses and Aristogitons,2 inasmuch as <lb/>
            lovers were delivered by them from a pleasant tyranny. <lb/>
            But this charge cannot justly be brought against genuine <lb/>
            lovers, and it was prettily said by Euripides, as he embraced <lb/>
            and kissed handsome Agatho whose beard was just sprout­ <lb/>
            ing, that the Autumn of beautiful youths was lovely as <lb/>
            well as the Spring. And I maintain that the love of <lb/>
            beautiful and chaste wives flourishes not only in old age <lb/>
            amid grey hairs and wrinkles, but even in the grave and <lb/>
            monument. And while there are few such long unions in <lb/>
            the case of boy-loves, one might enumerate ten thousand <lb/>
            such instances of the love of women, who have kept their <lb/>
            fidelity to the end of their lives. One such case I will <lb/>
            relate, which happened in my time in the reign of the <lb/>
            Emperor Vespasian.</p>
          <p>§ xxv. Julius, who stirred up a revolt in Galatia, among <lb/>
            several other confederates had one Sabinus, a young man <lb/>
            of good family, and for wealth and renown the most con­ <lb/>
            spicuous of all the men in those parts. But having attempted <note type="footnote"> 1 This means when the moustache and beard and whiskers begin <lb/>
            to grow. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The whole story about Harmodius and Aristogiton and how they <lb/>
            killed Hipparchus is told by Thucydides, vi. 54-59. Bion therefore <lb/>
            practically called these sprouting beards tyrant-killers, tyrannicides. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="68"/>
            what was too much for them they were foiled, and expect­ <lb/>
            ing to pay the penalty, some committed suicide, others fled <lb/>
            and were captured. Now Sabinus himself could easily have <lb/>
            got out of the way and made his escape to the barbarians, <lb/>
            but he had married a most excellent wife, whose name in <lb/>
            that part of the world was Empone, but in Greek would <lb/>
            be Herois, and he could neither leave her behind nor take <lb/>
            her with him. As he had in the country some underground <lb/>
            caves, known only to two of his freedmen, where he used <lb/>
            to stow away things, he dismissed all the rest of his slaves, <lb/>
            as if he intended to poison himself, and taking with him <lb/>
            these two trusty freedmen he descended with them into those <lb/>
            underground caves, and sent one of them, Martialis, to tell <lb/>
            his wife that he had poisoned himself, and that his body was <lb/>
            burnt in the flames of his country-house, for he wanted his <lb/>
            wife's genuine sorrow to lend credit to the report of his death. <lb/>
            And so it happened. For she, throwing herself on to the <lb/>
            ground, groaned and wailed for three days and nights, and <lb/>
            took no food. And Sabinus, being informed of this, and <lb/>
            fearing that she would die of grief, told Martialis to inform <lb/>
            her secretly that he was alive and well and in hiding, and to <lb/>
            beg her not to relax her show of grief, but to keep up the <lb/>
            farce. And she did so with the genius of a professional <lb/>
            actress, but yearning to see her husband she visited him <lb/>
            by night, and returned without being noticed, and for six <lb/>
            or seven months she lived with him this underground life. <lb/>
            And she disguised him by changing his dress, and cutting <lb/>
            off his beard, and re-arranging his hair, so that he should <lb/>
            not be known, and took him to Rome, having some hopes of <lb/>
            obtaining his pardon. But being unsuccessful in this she <lb/>
            returned to her own country, and spent most of her time with <lb/>
            her husband underground, but from time to time visited the <lb/>
            town, and showed herself to some ladies who were her friends <lb/>
            and relations. But what is most astonishing of all is that, <lb/>
            though she bathed with them, she concealed her pregnancy <lb/>
            from them. For the dye which women use to make their <lb/>
            hair a golden auburn, has a tendency to produce corpulence <lb/>
            and flesh and a full habit, and she rubbed this abundantly <lb/>
            over all parts of her body, and so concealed her pregnancy. <lb/>
            And she bare the pangs of travail by herself, as a lioness <lb/>
            bears her whelps, having hid herself in the cave with her <lb/>
             <pb n="69"/>
            husband, and there she gave birth to two boys, one of <lb/>
            whom died in Egypt, the other, whose name was Sabinus, <lb/>
            was among us only the other day at Delphi. Vespasian <lb/>
            eventually put her to death, but paid the penalty for it, <lb/>
            his whole progeny in a short time being wiped off the <lb/>
            face of the earthy For during the whole of his reign he <lb/>
            did no more savage act, nor could gods or demons have <lb/>
            turned away their eyes from a crueller sight. And yet her <lb/>
            courage and bold language abated the pity of the spectators, <lb/>
            though it exasperated Vespasian, for, despairing of her <lb/>
            safety, she bade them go and tell the Emperor, 'that <lb/>
            it was sweeter to live in darkness and underground than to <lb/>
            wear his crown.'”2</p>
          <p>§ XXVI. Here my father said that the conversation <lb/>
            about Love which took place at Thespiæ ended. And at, <lb/>
            this moment Diogenes, one of Pisias' companions, was <lb/>
            noticed coming up at a faster pace than walking. And <lb/>
            while he was yet a little way off, Soclarus hailed him with, <lb/>
            “You don't announce war, Diogenes," and be replied, <lb/>
            it Hush! it is a marriage; come with me quickly, for the <lb/>
            sacrifice only waits for you." All were delighted, and <lb/>
            Zeuxippus asked if Pisias was still against the marriage. <lb/>
            " As he was first to oppose it," said Diogenes, " so he was <lb/>
            first to yield the victory to Ismenodora, and he has now put <lb/>
            on a crown and robed himself in white, so as to take his <lb/>
            place at the head of the procession to the god through the <lb/>
            market-place." "Come," said my father, " in Heaven's <lb/>
            name, let us go and laugh at him, and worship the god; <lb/>
            for it is clear that the god has taken delight in what has <lb/>
            happened, and been propitious." <note type="footnote"> 1 “Scriptus igitur hie libellus est post caedem Domitiani.”—Reiske. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Vespasian certainly was not cruel generally. “Non temere quis <lb/>

          <p>After the customary marriage rites, by which the Priestess <lb/>
            of Demeter has united you together, I think that to make <lb/>
            an appropriate discourse, and one that will chime in with <lb/>
            the occasion, will be useful to you and agreeable to the <lb/>
            law. For in music one of the tunes played on the flute is <lb/>
            called Hippothorus,l which is a tune that excites fierce <lb/>
            desire in stallions to cover mares ; and though in philosophy <lb/>
            there are many goodly subjects, yet is there none mort <lb/>
            worthy of attention than that of marriage, on which subject <lb/>
            philosophy spreads a charm over those who are to pass lift <lb/>
            together, and makes them gentle and mild to one another <lb/>
            I send therefore as a gift to both of you a summary OJ <lb/>
            what you have often heard, as you are both well versed in <lb/>
            philosophy, arranging my matter in a series of short observa­ <lb/>
            lions that it may be the more easily remembered, and I pray <lb/>
            that the Muses will assist and co-operate with Aphrodite, so <lb/>
            that no lyre or lute could be more harmonious or in tune <lb/>
            than your married life, as the result of philosophy and con­ <lb/>
            cord. And thus the ancients set up near Aphrodite statues <lb/>
            of Hermes, to show that conversation was one of the great <lb/>
            charms of marriage, and also statues of Peitho2 and the <lb/>
            Graces, to teach married people to gain their way with one <lb/>
            another by persuasion, and not by wrangling or contention.</p>
          <p>§ I. Solon bade the bride eat a quince the first night of <lb/>
            marriage, intimating thereby, it seems, that the bridegroom <lb/>
            was to expect his first pleasure from the bride's mouth and <lb/>
            conversation.</p>
          <p>§ II. In Boeotia they dress up the bride with a chaplet <note type="footnote"> 1 This tune is again alluded to by Plutarch in "Quæstion. Convival.,’ <lb/>

            of asparagus, for as the asparagus gives most excellent <lb/>
            fruit from a thorny stalk, so the bride, by not being too <lb/>
            reluctant and coy in the first approaches, will make the <lb/>
            married state more agreeable and pleasant. But those <lb/>
            husbands who cannot put up with the early peevishness of <lb/>
            their brides, are not a whit wiser than those persons who <lb/>
            pluck unripe grapes and leave the ripe grapes for others.1 <lb/>
            On the other hand, many brides, being at first disgusted <lb/>
            with their husbands, are like those that stand the bee's sting <lb/>
            but neglect the honey.</p>
          <p>§ in. Married people should especially at the outset <lb/>
            beware of the first quarrel and collision, observing that <lb/>
            vessels when first fabricated are easily broken up into <lb/>
            their component parts, but in process of time, getting <lb/>
            compact and firmly welded together, are proof against either <lb/>
            fire or steel.</p>
          <p>§ iv. As fire gets kindled easily in chaff or in a wick <lb/>
            or in the fur of hares, but is easily extinguished again, if <lb/>
            it find no material to keep it in and feed it, so we must <lb/>
            not consider that the love of newly-married people, that <lb/>
            blazes out so fiercely in consequence of the attractions of <lb/>
            youth and beauty, will be durable and lasting, unless it be <lb/>
            fixed in the character, and occupy the mind, and make a , <lb/>
            living impression.2</p>
          <p>§ v. As catching fish by drugged bait is easy, but makes <lb/>
            the fish poor to eat and insipid, so those wives that lay <lb/>
            traps for their husbands by philtres and charms, and become <lb/>
            their masters by pleasure, have stupid senseless and spoiled <lb/>
            husbands to live with. For those that were bewitched by <lb/>
            Circe did her no good, nor could she make any use of them <lb/>
            when they were turned into swine and asses, but she was <lb/>
            greatly in love with the prudent Odysseus who dwelt with <lb/>
            her sensibly.</p>
          <p>§ vi. Those women who would rather lord it over fools <lb/>
            than obey sensible men, resemble those people who would <lb/>
            rather lead the blind on a road, and not. people who have <lb/>
            eyesight and know how to follow.</p>
          <p>§ VII. Women disbelieve that Pasiphäe, a king's wife, <note type="footnote"> 1 Compare the Proverb <foreign xml:lang="grc">Σικελὸς ὀμφακίζεται</foreign>, and Tibullus, iii. 5, 19 ; <lb/>

            was enamoured of a bull, although they see some of their <lb/>
            sex despising grave and sober men, and preferring to asso­ <lb/>
            ciate with men who are the slaves of intemperance and <lb/>
            pleasure, and like dogs and he-goats.</p>
          <p>§ VInI. Men who through weakness or effeminacy cannot <lb/>
            vault upon their horses' backs, teach them to kneel and so <lb/>
            receive their riders. Similarly, some men that marry noble <lb/>
            or rich wives, instead of making themselves better humble <lb/>
            their wives, thinking to rule them easier by lowering them. <lb/>
            But one ought to govern with an eye to the merit of a <lb/>
            woman, as much as to the size of a horse.</p>
          <p>§ ix. We see that the moon when it is far from the sun <lb/>
            is bright and glorious, but pales and hides its light when <lb/>
            it is near. A modest wife on the contrary ought to be <lb/>
            seen chiefly with her husband, and to stay at home and in <lb/>
            retirement in his absence.</p>
          <p>§ x. It is not a true observation of Herodotus, that a <lb/>
            woman puts off her modesty with her shift.1 On the con­ <lb/>
            trary, the modest woman puts on her modesty instead, and­ <lb/>
            great modesty is a sign of great conjugal love.</p>
          <p>§ xi. As where two voices are in unison the loudest <lb/>
            prevails; so in a well-managed household everything is <lb/>
            done by mutual consent, but the husband's supremacy is <lb/>
            exhibited, and his wishes are consulted.</p>
          <p>§ XII. The Sun beat the North Wind.2 For when it <lb/>
            blew a strong and terrible blast, and tried to make the man <lb/>
            remove his cloak, he only drew it round him more closely, <lb/>
            but when the Sun came out with its warm rays, at first <lb/>
            warmed and afterwards scorched, he stripped himself of <lb/>
            coat as well as cloak. Most woman act similarly : if their <lb/>
            husbands try to curtail by force their luxury and extrava­ <lb/>
            gance, they are vexed and fight for their rights, but if they <lb/>
            are convinced by reason, they quietly drop their expensive <lb/>
            habits, and keep within bounds.</p>
          <p>§ XIII. Cato turned out of the Senate a man who kissed <lb/>
            his own wife in the presence of his daughter. This was <lb/>
            perhaps too strong a step, but if it is unseemly, as indeed it <lb/>
            is, for husband and wife in the presence of others to fondle <note type="footnote"> 1 Herodotus, i. 8. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 An allusion to the well-known Fable of Æsop, No. 82 in Halm's <lb/>
            edition. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="73"/>
            and kiss and embrace one another, is it not far more un­ <lb/>
            seemly in the presence of others to quarrel and jangle? Just <lb/>
            as conjugal caresses and endearments ought to be private, <lb/>
            so ought admonition and scolding and plain speaking.</p>
          <p>§ xiv. Just as there is little use in a mirror adorned with <lb/>
            gold or precious stones, unless it conveys a true likeness, so <lb/>
            there is no advantage in a rich wife, unless she conforms <lb/>
            her life and habits to her husband's position. For if when <lb/>
            a man is joyful the mirror makes him look sad, and when <lb/>
            he is put out and sad it makes him look gay and smiling <lb/>
            from ear to ear, the mirror is plainly faulty. So the wife <lb/>
            is faulty and devoid of tact, who frowns when her husband <lb/>
            is in the vein for mirth and jollity, and who jokes and <lb/>
            laughs when he is serious : the former conduct is disagree­ <lb/>
            able, the latter contemptuous.1 And, just as geometricians <lb/>
            say lines and surfaces do not move of themselves, but only <lb/>
            in connection with bodies, so the wife ought to have no <lb/>
            private emotions of her own, but share in her husband's <lb/>
            gravity or mirth, anxiety or gaiety.</p>
          <p>§ xv. As those husbands who do not like to see their <lb/>
            wives eating and drinking in their company only teach <lb/>
            them to take their food on the sly, so those husbands who <lb/>
            are not gay and jolly with their wives, and never joke or <lb/>
            smile with them, only teach them to seek their pleasures <lb/>
            out of their company.</p>
          <p>§ xvi. The kings of Persia have their wedded wives at <lb/>
            their side at banquets and entertainments ; but when they <lb/>
            have a mind for a drunken debauch they send them away,2 <lb/>
            and call for singing-girls and concubines, rightly so doing, <lb/>
            for so they do not mix up their wives with licentiousness <lb/>
            and drunkenness. Similarly, if a private individual, lustful <lb/>
            and dissolute, goes astray with a courtesan or maid-servant, <lb/>
            the wife should not be vexed or impatient, but consider <lb/>
            that it is out of respect to her that he bestows upon another <lb/>
            all his wanton depravity. <note type="footnote"> 1 This comparison of the mirror is beautifully used by Keble in his <lb/>

          <p>§ XVII. As kings make1 if fond of music many musi­ <lb/>
            cians, if lovers of learning many men of letters, and <lb/>
            many athletes if fond of gymnastics, so the man who has <lb/>
            an eye for female charms teaches his wife to dress well, <lb/>
            the man of pleasure teaches his meretricious tricks and <lb/>
            wantonness, while the true gentleman makes his virtuous <lb/>
            and decorous.</p>
          <p>§ XVIII. A Lacedæmonian maiden, when someone asked <lb/>
            her if she had yet had dealings with a man, replied, " No, <lb/>
            but he has with me." This methinks is the line of con­ <lb/>
            duct a matron should pursue, neither to decline the <lb/>
            embraces of a husband when he takes the initiative, nor to <lb/>
            provoke them herself, for the one is forward and savours <lb/>
            of the courtesan, the other is haughty and unnatural.</p>
          <p>§ xix. The wife ought not to have her own private friends, <lb/>
            but cultivate only those of the husband. Now the gods are <lb/>
            our first and greatest friends, so the wife ought only to <lb/>
            worship and recognize her husband's gods, and the door <lb/>
            ought to be shut on all superfluous worship and strange <lb/>
            superstitions, for none of the gods are pleased with stealthy <lb/>
            and secret sacrifices on the part of a wife.</p>
          <p>§ xx. Plato says that is a happy and fortunate state, <lb/>
            where the words Meum and Tuum are least heard,2 because <lb/>
            the citizens regard the common interest in all matters of <lb/>
            importance. Far more essential is it in marriage that the <lb/>
            words should have no place. For, as the doctors say, that <lb/>
            blows on the left shoulders are also felt on the right,3 so is <lb/>
            it good4 for husband and wife to mutually sympathize <lb/>
            with one another, that, just as the strength of ropes comes <lb/>
            from the twining and interlacing of fibres together, so the <lb/>
            marriage knot may be confirmed and strengthened by the <lb/>
            interchange of mutual affection and kindness. Nature <lb/>
            itself teaches this by the birth of children, which are so <lb/>
            much a joint result, that neither husband nor wife can dis- <note type="footnote"> 1 By their patronage. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 " Republic," v. p. 462, 0. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 By the power of sympathy. This is especially true of eyes. <lb/>
            Wyttenbach compares the Epigram in the Anthology, i. 46. 9. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Καὶ</foreign> <lb/>

            criminate or discern which part of the child is theirs. <lb/>
            So, too, it is well for married persons to have one purse, <lb/>
            and to throw all their property into one common stock, <lb/>
            that here also there may be no Meum and Tuum. And <lb/>
            just as we call the mixture of water and wine by the <lb/>
            name of wine, even though the water should prepon­ <lb/>
            derate,1 so we say that the house and property belongs to <lb/>
            the man, even though the wife contribute most of the <lb/>
            money.</p>
          <p>§ xxi. Helen was fond of wealth, Paris of pleasure, <lb/>
            whereas Odysseus was prudent, Penelope chaste. So the <lb/>
            marriage of the last two was happy and enviable, while | <lb/>
            that of the former two brought an Iliad of woe on Greeks <lb/>
            and barbarians alike.</p>
          <p>§ XXII. The Roman who was taken to task by his friends <lb/>
            for repudiating a chaste wealthy and handsome wife, showed <lb/>
            them his shoe and said, " Although this is new and hand­ <lb/>
            some, none of you know where it pinches me."2 A wife <lb/>
            ought not therefore to put her trust in her dowry, or <lb/>
            family, or beauty, but in matters that more vitally concern <lb/>
            her husband, namely, in her disposition and companion­ <lb/>
            ableness and complaisance with him, not to make every­ <lb/>
            day life vexatious or annoying, but harmonious and cheer­ <lb/>
            ful and agreeable. For as doctors are more afraid of <lb/>
            fevers that are generated from uncertain causes, and from <lb/>
            a complication of ailments, than of those that have a clear <lb/>
            and adequate cause, so the small and continual and daily <lb/>
            matters of offence between husband and wife, that the <lb/>
            world knows nothing about, set the household most at <lb/>
            variance, and do it the greatest injury.</p>
          <p>§ XXIII. King Philip was desperately enamoured of a <lb/>
            Thessalian woman,3 who was accused of bewitching him; <lb/>
            his wife Olympias therefore wished to get this woman into <lb/>
            her power. But when she came before her, and was <note type="footnote"> 1 The ancients hardly ever drank wine neat. Hence the allusion. <lb/>

            and spells. So Juvenal, vi. 610, speaks of “Thessala philtia,” and see <lb/>
            Horace, " Odes,” i. 27. 21, 22; “Epodes," v. 45. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="76"/>
            evidently very handsome, and talked to her in a noble and <lb/>
            sensible manner, Olympias said, " Farewell to calumny! <lb/>
            Your charms lie in yourself.”1 So invincible are the <lb/>
            charms of a lawful wife to win her husband's affection by <lb/>
            her virtuous character, bringing to him in herself dowry, <lb/>
            and family, and philtres, and even Aphrodite's cestus.2</p>
          <p>§ xxiv. Olympias, on another occasion, when a young <lb/>
            courtier had married a wife who was very handsome, but <lb/>
            whose reputation was not very good, remarked, " This <lb/>
            fellow has no sense, or he would not have married with his <lb/>
            eyes.” We ought neither to marry with our eyes, nor <lb/>
            with our fingers, as some do, who reckon up on their <lb/>
            fingers what dowry the wife will bring, not what sort of <lb/>
            partner she will make.</p>
          <p>§ xxv. It was advice of Socrates, that when young men <lb/>
            looked at themselves in the mirror, those who were not <lb/>
            handsome should become so through virtue, and those who <lb/>
            were so should not by vice deform their beauty. Good <lb/>
            also is it for the matron, when she has the mirror in her <lb/>
            hands, if not handsome to say to herself, " What should I <lb/>
            be, if I were not virtuous ?" and if handsome to say to her­ <lb/>
            self, “How good it were to add virtue to beauty ! " for it <lb/>
            is a feather in the cap of a woman not handsome to be <lb/>
            loved for herself and not for good looks. •</p>
          <p>§ xxvi. Dionysius, the tyrant of Sicily, sent some costly <lb/>
            dresses and necklaces to the daughters of Lysander, but he <lb/>
            would not receive them, and said, " These presents will <lb/>
            bring my daughters more shame than adornment." And <lb/>
            Sophocles said still earlier than Lysander, " Your madness <lb/>
            of mind will not appear handsome, wretch, but most un­ <lb/>
            handsome.” For, as Crates says, “that is adornment which <lb/>
            adorns," and that adorns a woman that makes her more <lb/>
            comely; and it is not gold or diamonds or scarlet robes <lb/>
            that make her so, but her dignity, her correct conduct, and <lb/>
            her modesty.</p>

            marriage,L do not burn the gall with the other parts of the <lb/>
            victim, but when they have drawn it throw it away beside <lb/>
            the altar: the lawgiver thus hinting that gall and rage <lb/>
            have no place in marriage. For the austerity of a matron <lb/>
            should be, like that of wine, wholesome and pleasant, not <lb/>
            bitter as aloes, or like a drug.</p>
          <p>§ XXVIII. Plato advised Xenocrates, a man rather austere <lb/>
            but in all other respects a fine fellow, to sacrifice to the <lb/>
            Graces. I think also that a chaste wife needs the graces <lb/>
            with her husband that, as Metrodorus said, " she may live <lb/>
            agreeably with him, and not be bad-tempered because she <lb/>
            is chaste." For neither should the frugal wife neglect neat­ <lb/>
            ness, nor the virtuous one neglect to make herself attractive, <lb/>
            for peevishness makes a wife's good conduct disagreeable, <lb/>
            as untidiness makes one disgusted with simplicity.</p>
          <p>§ xxix. The wife who is afraid to laugh and jest with <lb/>
            her husband, lest she should appear bold and wanton, <lb/>
            resembles one that will not anoint herself with oil lest she <lb/>
            should be thought to use cosmetics, and will not wash her <lb/>
            face lest she should be thought to paint. We see also in <lb/>
            the case of those poets and orators, that avoid a popular <lb/>
            illiberal and affected style, that they artificially endeavour <lb/>
            to move and sway their audience by the facts, and by a <lb/>
            skilful arrangement of them, and by their gestures. Con­ <lb/>
            sequently a matron will do well to avoid and repudiate <lb/>
            over-preciseness meretriciousness and pomposity, and to <lb/>
            use tact in her dealings with her husband in every-day life, <lb/>
            accustoming him to a combination of pleasure and decorum. <lb/>
            But if a wife be by nature austere and apathetic, and no <lb/>
            lover of pleasure, the husband must make the best of it, <lb/>
            for, as Phocion said, when Antipater enjoined on him an <lb/>
            action neither honourable nor becoming, “Yon cannot <lb/>
            have me as a friend and flatterer both," so he must say <lb/>
            to himself about his strict and austere wife, "I cannot <lb/>
            have in the same woman wife and mistress."</p>
          <p>§ xxx. It was a custom among the Egyptian ladies not <lb/>
            to wear shoes, that they might stay at home all day and <lb/>
            not go abroad. But most of our women will only stay at <note type="footnote"> <lb/>

            home if you strip them of their golden shoes, and bracelets, <lb/>
            and shoe-buckles, and purple robes, and pearls.</p>
          <p>§ xxxi. Theano, as she was putting on her shawl, dis­ <lb/>
            played her arm, and somebody observing, " What a hand­ <lb/>
            some arm!" she replied, "But not common." So ought <lb/>
            not even the speech, any more than the arm, of a chaste <lb/>
            woman, to be common, for speech must be considered as <lb/>
            it were the exposing of the mind, especially in the pre­ <lb/>
            sence of strangers. For in words are seen the state of <lb/>
            mind and character and disposition of the speaker.</p>
          <p>§ XXXII. Phidias made a statue of Aphrodite at Elis, <lb/>
            with one foot on a tortoise,1 as a symbol that women should <lb/>
            stay at home and be silent. For the wife ought only to <lb/>
            speak either to her husband, or by her husband, not being <lb/>
            vexed if, like a flute-player, she speaks more decorously by <lb/>
            another mouth-piece.</p>
          <p>§ XXXIII. When rich men and kings honour philosophers, <lb/>
            they really pay homage to themselves as well; but when <lb/>
            philosophers pay court to the rich, they lower themselves <lb/>
            without advancing their patrons. The same is the case <lb/>
            with women. If they submit themselves to their husbands <lb/>
            they receive praise, but if they desire to rule, they get less <lb/>
            credit even than the husbands who submit to their rule. <lb/>
            But the husband ought to rule his wife, not as a master <lb/>
            does a chattel, but as the soul governs the body, by sym­ <lb/>
            pathy and goodwill. As he ought to govern the body by <lb/>
            not being a slave to its pleasures and desires, so he ought <lb/>
            to rule his wife by cheerfulness and complaisance.</p>
          <p>§ xxxiv. The philosophers tell us that some bodies are <lb/>
            composed of distinct parts, as a fleet or army; others of <lb/>
            connected parts, as a house or ship; others united and <lb/>
            growing together, as every animal is. The marriage of <lb/>
            lovers is like this last class, that of those who marry for <lb/>
            dowry or children is like the second class, and that of those <lb/>
            who only sleep together is like the first class, who may be <lb/>
            said to live in the same house, but in no other sense to live <lb/>
            together. But, just as doctors tell us that liquids are the <lb/>
            only things that thoroughly mix, so in married people <lb/>
            there must be a complete union of bodies, wealth, friends, <note type="footnote"> 1 See Pausanias, vi. 25. The statue was made of ivory and gold. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="79"/>
            and relations. And thus the Roman legislator forbade <lb/>
            married people to exchange presents with one another, not <lb/>
            that they should not go shares with one another, but that <lb/>
            they should consider everything as common property.</p>
          <p>§ XXXV. At Leptis, a town in Libya, it is the custom for <lb/>
            the bride the day after marriage to send to her mother-in­ <lb/>
            law's house for a pipkin, who does not lend her one, but <lb/>
            says she has not got one, that from the first the daughter­ <lb/>
            in-law may know her mother-in-law's stepmotherly mind,1 <lb/>
            that if afterwards she should be harsher still, she should <lb/>
            be prepared for it and not take it in. Knowing this the <lb/>
            wife ought to guard against any cause of offence, for the <lb/>
            bridegroom's mother is jealous of his affection to his wife. <lb/>
            But there is one cure for this condition of mind, to con­ <lb/>
            ciliate privately the husband's affection, and not to divert <lb/>
            or diminish his love for his mother.</p>
          <p>§ XXXVI. Mothers seem to love their sons best as able to <lb/>
            help them, and fathers their daughters as needing their help; <lb/>
            perhaps also it is in compliment to one another, that each <lb/>
            prefers the other sex in their children, and openly favours <lb/>
            it. This, however, is a matter perhaps of little importance. <lb/>
            But it looks very nice in the wife to show greater respect <lb/>
            to her husband's parents than to her own, and if anything <lb/>
            unpleasant has happened to confide it to them rather than <lb/>
            to her own people. For trust begets trusty and love love.</p>
          <p>§ XXXVII. The generals of the Greeks in Cyrus's army <lb/>
            ordered their men to receive the enemy silently if they <lb/>
            came up shouting, but if they came up silently to rush out <lb/>
            to meet them with a shout. So sensible wives, in their <lb/>
            husband's tantrums, are quiet when they storm, but if <lb/>
            they are silent and sullen talk them round and appease <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>§ XXXVIII. Rightly does Euripides3 censure those who <lb/>

            called in to assuage anger and grief, rather than to ener­ <lb/>
            vate the voluptuous still more than before. Think, there­ <lb/>
            fore, those in error who sleep together for pleasure, but <lb/>
            when they have any little difference with one another sleep <lb/>
            apart, and do not then more than at any other time invoke <lb/>
            Aphrodite, who is the best physician in such cases, as the <lb/>
            poet, I ween, teaches us, where he introduces Hera, saying: <lb/>
            " Their long-continued strife I now will end, <lb/>
            For to the bed of love I will them send.” 1</p>
          <p>§ xxxix. Everywhere and at all times should husband <lb/>
            and wife avoid giving one another cause of offence, but <lb/>
            most especially when they are in bed together. The woman <lb/>
            who was in labour and had a bad time said to those that <lb/>
            urged her to go to bed, " How shall the bed cure me, which <lb/>
            was the very cause of this trouble ? ” 2 And those diffe­ <lb/>
            rences and quarrels which the bed generates will not easily <lb/>
            be put an end to at any other time or place.</p>
          <p>§ XL. Hermione seems to speak the truth where she <lb/>
            says : <lb/>
            " The visits of bad women ruined me." 3 <lb/>
            But this case does not happen naturally, but only when dis­ <lb/>
            sension and jealousy has made wives open not only their <lb/>
            doors but their ears to such women. But that is the very <lb/>

            to excite him against the Greeks, on the ground that they <lb/>
            were treated well and yet reviled him, answered, " What <lb/>
            will they do then, if I treat them ill P " Whenever, then, <lb/>
            calumniating women come and say to a wife, " How badly <lb/>

            wife ! " let her answer, " How would he act then, if I were <lb/>

            with him just as he had got to the mill, said to him, " In <lb/>
            what more appropriate place could I have wished to find <lb/>

            to herself, " In what state would my rival be better pleased <lb/>

          <p>§ XLII. The Athenians have three sacred seedtimes: the <lb/>
            first at Scirus, as a remembrance of the original sowing of <lb/>
            corn, the second at Rharia, the third under Pelis, which is <lb/>
            called Buzygium.2 But a more sacred seedtime than all <lb/>
            these is the procreation of children, and therefore Sophocles <lb/>
            did well to call Aphrodite "fruitful Cytherea." Where­ <lb/>
            fore it behoves both husband and wife to be most careful <lb/>
            over this business, and to abstain from lawless and unholy <lb/>
            breaches of the marriage vow, and from sowing in quarters <lb/>
            where they desire no produce, or where, if any produce <lb/>
            should come, they would be ashamed of it and desire to <lb/>
            conceal it.3</p>
          <p>§ XLIII. When Gorgias the Rhetorician recited his speech <lb/>
            at Olympia recommending harmony to the Greeks, Melan­ <lb/>
            thins cried out, " He recommend harmony to us ! Why, <lb/>
            he can't persuade his wife and maid to live in harmony, <lb/>
            though there are only three of them in the house ! " Gor­ <lb/>
            gias belike had an intrigue with the maid, and his wife <lb/>
            was jealous. He then must have his own house in good <lb/>
            order who undertakes to order the affairs of his friends <lb/>
            and the public, for any ill-doings on the part of husbands <lb/>
            to their wives is far more likely to come out and be known <lb/>
            to the public than the ill-doings of wives to their bus­ <lb/>

          <p>§ XLIV. They say the cat is driven mad by the smell of <lb/>

            by perfumes, it is monstrous that their husbands should <lb/>
            not abstain from using perfumes, rather than for so small <lb/>
            a pleasure to incommode so grievously their wives. And <lb/>
            since they suffer quite as much when their husbands go <lb/>
            with other women, it is unjust for a small pleasure to pain <lb/>
            and grieve wives, and not to abstain from connection with <lb/>
            other women, when even bee-keepers will do as much, <lb/>
            because bees are supposed to dislike and sting those that <lb/>
            have had dealings with women.</p>
          <p>§ XLV. Those that approach elephants do not dress in <lb/>
            white, nor those that approach bulls in red, for these <lb/>
            colours render those animals savage ; and tigers they say <lb/>
            at the beating of drums go quite wild, and tear themselves <lb/>
            in their rage. Similarly, as some men cannot bear to see <lb/>
            scarlet and purple dresses, and others are put out by cym­ <lb/>
            bals and drums, 1 what harm would it do wives to abstain <lb/>
            from these things, and not to vex or provoke husbands, but <lb/>
            to live with them quietly and meekly ?</p>
          <p>§ XLVI. A woman said to Philip, who against her will <lb/>
            was pulling her about, " Let me go, all women are alike <lb/>
            when the lamp is put out." 2 A good remark to adulterers <lb/>
            and debauchees. But the married woman ought to show <lb/>
            when the light is put out that she is not like all other <lb/>
            women, for then, when her body is not visible, she ought <lb/>
            to exhibit her chastity and modesty as well as her personal <lb/>
            affection to her husband.</p>
          <p>§ XLVII. Plato3 recommended old men to act with <lb/>
            decorum especially before young men, that they too might <lb/>
            show respect to them; for where the old behave shame­ <lb/>
            lessly, no modesty or reverence will be exhibited by the <lb/>
            young. The husband ought to remember this, and show <lb/>
            no one more respect than his wife, knowing that the bridal <lb/>
            chamber will be to her either a school of virtue or of vice. <lb/>
            And he who enjoys pleasures that he forbids his wife, is <lb/>
            like a man that orders his wife to go on fighting against an <lb/>
            enemy to whom he has himself surrendered.</p>

            remember what was written by Timoxena to Aristylla: <lb/>
            and do you, Pollianus, not suppose that your wife will <lb/>
            abstain from extravagance and expense, if she sees that <lb/>
            yon do not despise such vanities in others, but delight in <lb/>
            gilt cups, and pictures in houses, and trappings for mules, <lb/>
            and ornaments for horses. For it is not possible to banish <lb/>
            extravagance from the women's side of the house if it is <lb/>
            always to be seen in the men's apartments. Moreover, <lb/>
            Pollianus, as you are already old enough for the study of <lb/>
            philosophy, adorn your character by its teaching, whether <lb/>
            it consists of demonstration or constructive reasoning, by <lb/>
            associating and conversing with those that can profit you. <lb/>
            And for your wife gather honey from every quarter, as the <lb/>
            bees do, and whatever knowledge you have yourself ac­ <lb/>
            quired impart to her, and converse with her, making the <lb/>
            best arguments well known and familiar to her. For now <lb/>
            " Father thou art to her, and mother dear, <lb/>
            And brother too." I <lb/>
            And no less decorous is it to hear the wife say, " Husband, <lb/>
            you are my teacher and philosopher and guide in the most <lb/>
            beautiful and divine subjects." For such teaching in the <lb/>
            first place detaches women from absurdities : for the woman <lb/>
            who has learnt geometry will be ashamed to dance, nor will <lb/>
            she believe in incantations and spells, if she has been charmed <lb/>
            by the discourses of Plato and Xenophon; and if anyone <lb/>
            should undertake to draw the moon down from the sky, <lb/>
            she will laugh at the ignorance and stupidity of women <lb/>
            that credit such nonsense, well understanding geometry, <lb/>
            and having heard how Aglaonice, the daughter of the <lb/>
            Thessalian Hegetor, having a thorough knowledge of the <lb/>
            eclipses of the moon, and being aware beforehand of the <lb/>
            exact time when the moon would be in eclipse, cheated the <lb/>
            women, and persuaded them that she herself had drawn it <lb/>
            down from the sky. For no woman was ever yet credited <lb/>
            with having had a child without intercourse with a man, <lb/>
            for those shapeless embryos and gobbets of flesh that take <lb/>
            form from corruption are called moles. We must guard <lb/>
            against such false conceptions as these arising in the minds <note type="footnote"> 1 From the words of Andromache to Hector, “Iliad,” vi. 429, 430. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="84"/>
            of women, for if they are not well informed by good pre­ <lb/>
            cepts, and share in the teaching that men get, they <lb/>
            generate among themselves many foolish and absurd ideas <lb/>
            and states of mind. But do you, Eurydice, study to make <lb/>
            yourself acquainted with the sayings of wise and good <lb/>
            women, and ever have on your tongue those sentiments <lb/>
            which as a girl you learnt with us, that so you may make <lb/>
            your husband's heart glad, and be admired by all other <lb/>
            women, being in yourself so wonderfully and splendidly <lb/>
            adorned. For one cannot take or put on, except at great <lb/>
            expense, the jewels of this or that rich woman, or the silk <lb/>
            dresses of this or that foreign woman, but the virtues that <lb/>
            adorned Theano,l and Cleobuline, and Gorge the wife of <lb/>
            Leonidas, and Timoclea the sister of Theagenes, and the <lb/>
            ancient Claudia,2 and Cornelia the sister of Scipio,3 and all <lb/>
            other such noble and famous women, these one may array <lb/>
            oneself in without money and without price, and so adorned <lb/>
            lead a happy and famous life. For if Sappho plumed her­ <lb/>
            self so much on the beauty of her lyrical poetry as to write <lb/>
            to a certain rich woman, " You shall lie down in your tomb, <lb/>
            nor shall there be any remembrance of you, for you have <lb/>
            no part in the roses of Pieria," how shall you not have a <lb/>
            greater right to plume yourself on having a part not in the <lb/>
            roses but in the fruits which the Muses bring, and which <lb/>
            they freely bestow on those that admire learning and philo­ <lb/>
            sophy ? 4 <note type="footnote"> 1 Theano was the wife of Pythagoras. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 See Livy, xxix. 14. Propertius, v. 11. 51, 52. Ovid, " Fasti," iv. <lb/>

            <title type="sub">CONSOLATORY LETTER TO HIS WIFE.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>§ I. Plutarch to his wife sends greeting. The messenger <lb/>
            that yon sent to me to announce the death of our little girl <lb/>
            seems to have missed his way en route for Athens ; but <lb/>
            when I got to Tanagra I heard the news from my niece. <lb/>
            I suppose the funeral has already taken place, and I hope <lb/>
            everything went off so as to give you least sorrow both now <lb/>
            and hereafter. But if you left undone anything you <lb/>
            wished to do, waiting for my opinion, and thinking your <lb/>
            grief would then be lighter, be it without ceremoniousness <lb/>
            or superstition, both which things are indeed foreign to <lb/>
            your character.</p>
          <p>§ II. Only, my dear wife, let us both be patient at this <lb/>
            calamity. I know and can see very clearly how great it is, <lb/>
            but should I find your grief too excessive, it would trouble <lb/>
            me even more than the event itself. And yet I have not a <lb/>
            heart hard as heart of oak or flintstone, as you yourself <lb/>
            know very well, who have shared with me in the bringing <lb/>
            up of so many children, as they have all been educated at <lb/>
            home by ourselves. And this one I know was more <lb/>
            especially beloved by you, as she was the first daughter after <lb/>
            four sons, when you longed for a daughter, and so I gave <lb/>
            her your name.1 And as you are very fond of children your <lb/>
            grief must have a peculiar bitterness when you call to mind <lb/>
            her pure and simple gaiety, which was without a tincture <lb/>
            of passion or querulousness. For she had from nature a <lb/>
            wonderful contentedness of mind and meekness, and her <lb/>
            affectionateness and winning ways not only pleased one <lb/>
            but also afforded a means of observing her kindliness of <lb/>
            heart, for she used to bid her nurse2 give the teat not only <lb/>
            to other children but even to her favourite playthings, and <lb/>
            so invited them as it were to her table in kindliness of <lb/>
            heart, and gave them a share of her good things, and pro­ <lb/>
            vided the best entertainment for those that pleased her.</p>
          <p>§ III. But I see no reason, my dear wife, why these and <lb/>
            similar traits in her character, that gave us delight in her life- <note type="footnote"> 1 Timoxena, as we see later on, § ix. </note><note type="footnote"> * Adopting Reiske’s reading, <foreign xml:lang="grc">μαστὸν κελεύουσα, προεκαλε</foreign>ĩ<foreign xml:lang="grc">το καθάπερ</foreign>. </note> <lb/>

            time, should now, when recalled to the memory, grieve and <lb/>
            trouble us. Though, on the other hand, I fear that if we <lb/>
            cease to grieve we may also cease to remember her, like <lb/>
            Clymene, who says in the Play 1— <lb/>
            “ I hate the supple bow of cornel-wood, <lb/>
            And would put down athletics," <lb/>
            because she ever avoided and trembled at anything that re­ <lb/>
            minded her of her son, for it brought grief with it, and it <lb/>
            is natural to avoid everything that gives us pain. But as <lb/>
            she gave us the greatest pleasure in embracing her and <lb/>
            even in seeing and hearing her, so ought her memory <lb/>
            living and dwelling with us to give us more, aye, many <lb/>
            times more, joy than grief, since those arguments that we <lb/>
            have often used to others ought to be profitable to us in the <lb/>
            present conjuncture, nor should we sit down and rail <lb/>
            against fortune, opposing to those joys many more griefs.</p>
          <p>§ iv. Those who were present at the funeral tell me with <lb/>
            evident surprise that you put on no mourning, and that <lb/>
            you bedizened up neither yourself nor your maids with the <lb/>
            trappings of woe, and that there was no ostentatious ex­ <lb/>
            penditure of money at the funeral, but that everything was <lb/>
            done orderly and silently in the presence of our relations. <lb/>
            I am not myself surprised that yon, who never made a dis­ <lb/>
            play either at the theatre or on any other public occasion, <lb/>
            and thought extravagance useless even in the case of <lb/>
            pleasure, should have been frugal in your grief. For not <lb/>
            only ought the chaste woman to remain uncorrupt in <lb/>
            Bacchanalian revels,2 but she ought to consider her self- <lb/>
            control not a whit less necessary in the surges of sorrow <lb/>
            and emotion of grief, contending not (as most people think) <lb/>
            against natural affection, but against the extravagant wishes <lb/>
            of the soul. For we are indulgent to natural affection in <lb/>
            the regret, and honour, and memory that it pays to the dead : <lb/>
            but the insatiable desire for a passionate display of funeral <lb/>
            grief, coming to the climax in coronachs and beatings of <lb/>
            the breast, is not less unseemly than intemperance in <note type="footnote"> 1 Euripides'" Phaethon," which exists only in fragments. Clymene <lb/>
            was ihe daughter of Ocean us, and mother of Phaethon. </note><note type="footnote"> a An allusion to Euripides, “ Bacchæ,” 317, 318. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="87"/>
            pleasure and is unreasonably1 forgiven only because pain <lb/>
            and grief instead of delight are elements in the unseemly <lb/>
            exhibition. For what is more unreasonable than to curtail <lb/>
            excessive laughter or any other demonstration of joy, and <lb/>
            to allow a free vent to copious lamentation and wailing that <lb/>
            come from the same source ? And how unreasonable is it, <lb/>
            as some husbands do, to quarrel with their wives about <lb/>
            perfume and purple robes, while they allow them to shear <lb/>
            their heads in mourning, and to dress in black, and to sit <lb/>
            in idle grief, and to lie down in weariness ! And what is <lb/>
            worst of all, how unreasonable is it for husbands to inter­ <lb/>
            fere if their wives chastise the domestics and maids im­ <lb/>
            moderately or without sufficient cause, yet allow them to <lb/>
            ill-treat themselves cruelly in cases and conjunctures that <lb/>
            require repose and kindness !</p>
          <p>.§ v. But between us, my dear wife, there never was any <lb/>
            occasion for such a contest, nor do I think there ever will <lb/>
            be. For as to your economy in dress and simple way of <lb/>
            living, there is no philosopher with whom you are acquainted <lb/>
            whom you did not amaze, nor is there any citizen who has <lb/>
            not observed2 how plainly you dressed at sacred rites, and <lb/>
            sacrifices, and theatres. You have also already on similar <lb/>
            painful occasions exhibited great fortitude, as when you lost <lb/>
            your eldest son, and again when our handsome Chæron died. <lb/>
            For when I was informed of his death, I well remember <lb/>
            some guests from the sea were coming home with me to my <lb/>
            house as well as some others, but when they saw the great <lb/>
            quiet and tranquillity of the household, they thought, as they <lb/>
            afterwards told some other people, that no such disaster had <lb/>
            really happened, but that the news was untrue. So well <lb/>

            you had suckled that son, though your breast had had to be <lb/>

            brought to them clean and tidy, take them into their hands <lb/>
            as playthings, and when they die burst out into idle and <lb/>
            unthankful grief, not so much out of affection-for affec­ <lb/>
            tion is thoughtful and noble-but a great yearning for vain <lb/>
            glory1 mixed with a little natural affection makes their grief <lb/>
            fierce and vehement and hard to appease. And this does <lb/>
            not seem to have escaped Æsop’s notice, for he says that <lb/>
            when Zeus assigned their honours to various gods, Grief <lb/>
            also claimed his. And Zeus granted his wish, with this <lb/>
            limitation that only those who chose and wished need pay <lb/>
            him honour.2 It is thus with grief at the outset, everyone <lb/>
            welcomes it at first, but after it has got by process of time <lb/>
            settled, and become an inmate of the house, it is with diffi­ <lb/>
            culty dislodged again, however much people may wish to dis­ <lb/>
            lodge it. Wherefore we ought to keep it out of doors, and <lb/>
            not let it approach the garrison by wearing mourning or <lb/>
            shearing the hair, or by any similar outward sign of sorrow. <lb/>
            For these things occurring daily and being importunate <lb/>
            make the mind little, and narrow, and unsocial, and harsh, <lb/>
            and timid, so that, being besieged and taken in hand by <lb/>
            grief, it can no longer laugh, and shuns daylight, and avoids <lb/>
            society. This evil will be followed by neglect of the body, <lb/>
            and dislike to anointing and the bath and the other usual <lb/>
            modes of life : whereas the very opposite ought to be the <lb/>
            case, for the mind ill at ease especially requires that the <lb/>
            body should be in a sound and healthy condition. For much <lb/>
            of grief is blunted and relaxed when the body is permeated <lb/>
            by calm, like the sea in fine weather. But if the body get <lb/>
            into a dry and parched condition from a low diet, and gives <lb/>
            no proper nutriment to the soul, but only feeds it with <lb/>
            sorrow and grief, as it were with bitter and injurious ex­ <lb/>
            halations, it cannot easily recover its tone however people <lb/>
            may wish it should. Such is the state of the soul that has <lb/>
            been so ill-treated.</p>

            most formidable peril in connection with this is " the visits <lb/>
            of bad women,” 1 and their chatter, and joint lamentation, <lb/>
            all which things fan the fire of sorrow and aggravate it, and <lb/>
            suffer it not to be extinguished either by others or by itself. <lb/>
            I am not ignorant what a time of it you had lately, when <lb/>
            you went to the aid of Theon's sister, and fought against <lb/>
            the women who came on a visit of condolence and rushed up <lb/>
            with lamentation and wailing, adding fuel as it were to <lb/>
            her fire of grief in their simplicity. For when people see <lb/>
            their friends' houses on fire they put it out as quickly and <lb/>
            energetically as they can, but when their souls are on fire <lb/>
            they themselves bring fuel. And if anybody has anything <lb/>
            the matter with his eyes they will not let him put his hands <lb/>
            to them, however much he wish, nor do they themselves <lb/>
            touch the inflamed part; but a person in grief sits down <lb/>
            and gives himself up to every chance comer, like a river <lb/>
            [that all make use of], to stir up and aggravate the sore, <lb/>
            so that from a little tickling and discomfort it grows into <lb/>
            a great and terrible disease. However, as to all this I know <lb/>
            you will be on your guard.</p>
          <p>§ vin. Try also often to carry yourself back in memory <lb/>
            to that time when, this little girl not having been then <lb/>
            born, we bad nothing to charge Fortune with, and to com­ <lb/>
            pare that time and this together, as if our circumstances <lb/>
            had gone back to what they were then. Otherwise, my <lb/>
            dear wife, we shall seem discontented at the birth of our <lb/>
            little daughter, if we consider our position before her birth <lb/>
            as more perfect. But we ought not to erase from our <lb/>
            memory the two years of her life, but to consider them as <lb/>
            I a time of pleasure giving us gratification and enjoyment, <lb/>
            and not to deem the shortness of the blessing as a great <lb/>
            evil, nor to be unthankful for what was given us, because <lb/>
            Fortune did not give us a longer tenure as we wished. For <lb/>
            ever to be careful what we say about the gods, and to be <lb/>
            cheerful and not rail against Fortune, brings a sweet and <lb/>
            goodly profit; and he who in such conjunctures as ours <lb/>
            mostly tries to remember his blessings, and turns and diverts <lb/>
            his mind from the dark and disturbing things in life to the <note type="footnote"> 1 An allusion to Euripides, “Andromache,” 930. See Platarch’s <lb/>

            bright and radiant, either altogether extinguishes his grief or <lb/>
            makes it small and dim from a comparison with his comforts. <lb/>
            For as perfume gives pleasure to the nose, and is a remedy <lb/>
            against disagreeable smells, so the remembrance of past <lb/>
            happiness in present trouble gives all the relief they require <lb/>
            to those who do not shut out of their memory the blessings of <lb/>
            the past, or always and everywhere rail against Fortune. <lb/>
            And this certainly ought not to be our case, that we should <lb/>
            slander all our past life because, like a book, it has one erasure <lb/>
            in it, when all the other pages have been bright and clean.</p>
          <p>§ ix. You have often heard that happiness consists in <lb/>
            right calculations resulting in a healthy state of mind, and <lb/>
            that the changes which Fortune brings about need not up­ <lb/>
            set it, and introduce confusion into our life. But if we too <lb/>
            must, like most people, be governed by external events, <lb/>
            and make an inventory of the dealings of Fortune, and <lb/>
            constitute other people the judges of our felicity, do not <lb/>
            now regard the tears and lamentations of those who visit <lb/>
            you, which by a faulty custom are lavished on everybody, <lb/>
            but consider rather how happy you are still esteemed by <lb/>
            them for your family, your house, and life. For it would <lb/>
            be monstrous, if others would gladly prefer your destiny to <lb/>
            theirs, even taking into account our present sorrow, that you <lb/>
            should rail against and be impatient at our present lot, <lb/>
            and in consequence of our bitter grief not reflect how much <lb/>
            comfort is still left to us. But like those who quote im­ <lb/>
            perfect verses of Homer1 and neglect the finest passages of <lb/>
            his writings, to enumerate and complain of the trials of <lb/>
            life, while you pay no attention to its blessings, is to <lb/>
            resemble those stingy misers, who heap up riches and make <lb/>
            no use of them when they have them, but lament and are <lb/>
            impatient if they are lost. And if you grieve over her <lb/>
            dying unmarried and childless, you can comfort yourself <lb/>
            with the thought that you have had both those advantages. <lb/>
            For they should not be reckoned as great blessings in the <lb/>
            case of those who do not enjoy them, and small blessings <lb/>
            in the case of those who do. And that she has gone to a <note type="footnote"> I The whole subject is discussed in full by Athenæus, p. 632, F. F. <lb/>

            place where she is out of pain ought not to pain us, for <lb/>
            what evil can we mourn for on her account if her pains are <lb/>
            over ? For even the loss of important things does not <lb/>
            grieve us when we have no need of them. But it was only <lb/>
            little things that your Timoxena was deprived of, little things <lb/>
            only she knew, and in little things only did she rejoice ; and <lb/>
            how can one be said to be deprived of things of which one <lb/>
            had no conception, nor experience, nor even desire for ?</p>
          <p>§ x. As to what you hear from some people, who get <lb/>
            many to credit their notion, that the dead suffer no evil or <lb/>
            pain, I know that you are prevented from believing that by <lb/>
            the tradition of our fathers and by the mystic symbols of the <lb/>
            mysteries of Dionysus, for we are both initiated. Consider <lb/>
            then that the soul, being incorruptible, is in the same con­ <lb/>
            dition after death as birds that have been caught. For if <lb/>
            it has been a long time in the body, and during this mortal <lb/>
            life has become tame by many affairs and long habit, it <lb/>
            swoops down again and a second time enters the body, and <lb/>
            does not cease to be involved in the changes and chances of <lb/>
            this life that result from birth. For do not suppose that <lb/>
            old age is abused and ill-spoken of only for its wrinkles <lb/>
            and white hair and weakness of body, but this is the worst <lb/>
            feature about it, that it makes the soul feeble in its re­ <lb/>
            membrance of things in the other world, and strong in its <lb/>
            attachment to things in this world, and bends and presses <lb/>
            it, if it retain the form which it had in the body from its <lb/>
            experience. But that soul, which does indeed enter the <lb/>
            body, but remains only a short time in it, being liberated <lb/>
            from it by the higher powers, rears as it were at a damp <lb/>
            and soft turning post in the race of life, and hastens on to <lb/>
            its destined goal. For just as if anyone put out a fire, and <lb/>
            light it again at once, it is soon rekindled, and burns up <lb/>
            again quickly, but if it has been out a long time, to light it <lb/>
            again will be a far more difficult and irksome task, so the <lb/>
            soul that has sojourned only a short time in this dark and <lb/>
            mortal life, quickly recovers the light and blaze of its <lb/>
            former bright life, whereas for those who have not had the <lb/>
            good fortune very early, to use the language of the poet, <lb/>
            " to pass the gates of Hades,”1 nothing remains but a great <note type="footnote"> 1 Homer, “Iliad,” v. 646; xxiii. 71. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="92"/>
            passion for the things of this life, and a softening of the <lb/>
            soul through contact with the body, and a melting away of <lb/>
            it as if by the agency of drugs.1</p>
          <p>§ xi. And the truth of this is rendered more apparent in <lb/>
            our hereditary and time-honoured customs and laws. For <lb/>
            when infants die no libations are poured out for them, nor <lb/>
            are any other rites performed for them, such as are always <lb/>
            performed for adults. For they have no share in the earth <lb/>
            or in things of the earth, nor do parents haunt their tombs <lb/>
            or monuments, or sit by their bodies when they are laid <lb/>
            out. For the laws do not allow us to mourn for such, <lb/>
            seeing that it is an impious thing to do so in the case of <lb/>
            persons who have departed into a better and more divine <lb/>
            place and sphere. I know that doubts are entertained <lb/>
            about this, but since to doubt is harder for them than to <lb/>
            believe, let us do externally as the laws enjoin, and in­ <lb/>
            ternally let us be more holy and pure and chaste.2</p>

            <title type="sub">THAT VIRTUE MAY BE TAUGHT.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>§ I. As to virtue we deliberate and dispute whether good <lb/>
            sense, and justice, and rectitude can be taught: and then <lb/>
            we are not surprised that, while the works of orators, and <lb/>
            pilots, and musicians, and house-builders, and farmers, are <lb/>
            innumerable, good men are only a name and expression, <lb/>
            like Centaurs and Giants and Cyclopes, and that it is im­ <lb/>
            possible to find any virtuous action without alloy of base <lb/>
            motives, or any character free from vice : but if nature <lb/>
            produces spontaneously anything good, it is marred by <lb/>
            much that is alien to it, as fruit choked by weeds. Men <lb/>
            learn to play on the harp, and to dance, and to read, and <lb/>
            to farm, and to ride on horseback: they learn how to put <lb/>
            on their shoes and clothes generally : people teach how <note type="footnote"> 1 This section is dreadfully corrupt. I have adopted, it will be seen, <lb/>
            the suggestions of Wyttenbach. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This Consolatory Letter ends rather abruptly. It is probable that <lb/>

            to pour out wine, how to cook; and all these things <lb/>
            cannot be properly performed, without being learned. <lb/>
            The art of good living alone, though all those things I <lb/>
            have mentioned only exist on its account, is untaught, <lb/>
            unmethodical, inartistic, and supposed to come by the light <lb/>
            of nature!</p>
          <p>§ II. 0 sirs, by asserting that virtue is not a thing to be <lb/>
            taught, why are we making it unreal ? For if teaching <lb/>
            produces it, the deprivation of teaching prevents it. And <lb/>
            yet, as Plato says, a discord and false note on the lyre <lb/>
            makes not brother go to war with brother, nor sets friends <lb/>
            at variance, nor makes states hostile to one another, so as <lb/>
            to do and suffer at one another's hands the most dreadful <lb/>
            things :1 nor can anyone say that there was ever a dissen­ <lb/>
            sion in any city as to the pronunciation of Telchines : nor <lb/>
            in a private house any difference between man and wife as <lb/>
            to woof and warp. And yet no one without learning would <lb/>
            undertake to ply the loom, or write a book, or play on the <lb/>
            lyre, though he would thereby do no great harm, but he fears <lb/>
            making himself ridiculous, for as Heraclitus says, "It is <lb/>
            better to hide one's ignorance," yet everyone thinks himself <lb/>
            competent to manage a house and wife and the state and <lb/>
            hold any magisterial office. On one occasion, when a boy <lb/>
            was eating rather greedily, Diogenes gave the lad's tutor a <lb/>
            blow with his fist, ascribing the fault not to the boy, who <lb/>
            had not learnt how to eat properly, but to the tutor who <lb/>
            had not taught him. And can one not properly handle a dish <lb/>
            or a cup, unless one has learnt from a boy, as Aristophanes <lb/>
            bids us, " not to giggle, nor eat too fast, nor cross our <lb/>
            legs,” 2 and yet be perfectly fit to manage a family and city, <lb/>
            and wife, and live well, and hold office, when one has not <lb/>
            learnt how one should behave in the conduct of life ? <lb/>
            When Aristippus was asked by someone, " Are you every­ <lb/>
            where then ? " he smiled and said, " If I am everywhere, I <lb/>
            lose my passage money." 3 Why should not you also say, <lb/>
            “ If men are not better for learning, the money paid to tutors <lb/>
            is also lost ? " For just as nurses mould with their hands <note type="footnote"> 1 Plato, " Clitophon," p. 407, C. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Aristophanes, " Clouds," 983. </note><note type="footnote"> 8 Does Juvenal allude to this, viii. 97 ? </note> <lb/>

            the child's body, so tutors, receiving it immediately it is <lb/>
            weaned, mould its soul, teaching it by habit the first <lb/>
            vestiges of virtue. And the Lacedæmonian, who was asked, <lb/>
            what good he did as a tutor, replied, " I make what is good <lb/>
            pleasant to boys." Moreover tutors teach boys to walk <lb/>
            in the streets with their beads down,1 to touch salt fish with <lb/>
            one finger only, other fish bread and meat with two, to <lb/>
            scratch themselves in such a way, and in such a way to <lb/>
            put on their cloak.2</p>
          <p>§ in. What then ? He that says that the doctor's skill <lb/>
            is wanted in the case of a slight skin-eruption or whitlow, <lb/>
            but is not needed in the case of pleurisy, fever, or lunacy, in <lb/>
            what respect does he differ from the man that says that <lb/>
            schools and teaching and precepts are only for small and <lb/>
            boyish duties, while great and important matters are to <lb/>
            be left to mere routine and accident ? For, as the man is <lb/>
            ridiculous who says we ought to learn to row but not to <lb/>
            steer, so he who allows all other arts to be learnt, but not <lb/>
            virtue, seems to act altogether contrary to the Scythians. <lb/>
            For they, as Herodotus tells us,3 blind their slaves that <lb/>
            they may remain with them, but such an one puts the eye <lb/>
            of reason into slavish and servile arts, and takes it away <lb/>
            from virtue. And the general Iphicrates well answered <lb/>
            Callias, the son of Chabrias, who asked him, " What are <lb/>
            you? an archer? a targeteer? cavalry, or infantry?" <lb/>
            " None of these," said he, " but the commander of them <lb/>
            all." Ridiculous therefore is he who says that the use of <lb/>
            the bow and other arms and the sling and riding are to be <lb/>

          <p>§ I. Clothes seem to warm a man, not by throwing out <lb/>
            beat themselves (for in itself every garment is cold, whence <lb/>
            in great heat or in fevers people frequently change and <lb/>
            shift them), but the heat which a man throws out from <lb/>
            his own body is retained and wrapped in by a dress fitting <lb/>
            close to the body, which does not admit of the heat being <lb/>
            dissipated when once it has got firm hold. A somewhat <lb/>
            similar case is the idea that deceives the mass of mankind, <lb/>
            that if they could live in big houses, and get together a <lb/>
            quantity of slaves and money, they would have a happy <lb/>
            life. But a happy and cheerful life is not from without, <lb/>
            on the contrary, a man adds the pleasure and gratification <lb/>
            to the things that surround him, his temperament being as <lb/>
            it were the source of his feelings.3 <lb/>
            " But when the fire blazes the house is brighter to look at." 4 <lb/>
            So, too, wealth is pleasanter, and fame and power more <lb/>
            splendid, when a man has joy in his heart, seeing that men <lb/>
            can bear easily and quietly poverty and exile and old age <lb/>
            if their character is a contented and mild one.</p>

            whereas vice if infused into it makes splendour and wealth <lb/>
            and magnificence painful, and sickening, and unwelcome to <lb/>
            its possessors. <lb/>
            “ He is deemed happy in the market-place, <lb/>

            His wife rules all, quarrels, and domineers.” 1 <lb/>
            And yet there would be no great difficulty in getting rid of a <lb/>
            bad wife, if one was a man and not a slave. But a man can­ <lb/>
            not by writing a bill of divorce to his vice get rid of all <lb/>
            trouble at once, and enjoy tranquillity by living apart: for <lb/>
            it is ever present in his vitals, and sticks to him night and <lb/>
            day, "and burns without a torch, and consigns him to gloomy <lb/>
            old age," 2 being a disagreeable fellow-traveller owing to <lb/>
            its arrogance, and a costly companion at table owing to its <lb/>
            daintiness, and an unpleasant bed-fellow, disturbing and <lb/>
            marring sleep by anxiety and care and envy. For during <lb/>
            such a one's sleep the body indeed gets rest, but the mind <lb/>
            has terrors, and dreams, and perturbations, owing to super­ <lb/>
            stition, <lb/>
            " For when my trouble catches me asleep, <lb/>
            I am undone by the most fearful dreams," <lb/>
            as one says. For thus envy, and fear, and anger, and lust <lb/>
            affect one. During the daytime, indeed, vice looks abroad <lb/>
            and imitates the behaviour of others, is shy and conceals <lb/>
            its evil desires, and does not altogether give way to its <lb/>
            propensities, but often even resists and fights stoutly against <lb/>
            them; but in sleep it escapes the observation of people <lb/>
            and the law, and, being as far as possible removed from <lb/>
            fear or modesty, gives every passion play, and excites its <lb/>
            depravity and licentiousness, for, to borrow Plato's expres­ <lb/>

            tion does indeed augment the pleasures of the body, but <lb/>
            for the soul there can be no lasting joy or gratification, <lb/>
            unless cheerfulness and fearlessness and courage supply a <lb/>
            calm serenity free from storms; for otherwise, even if hope <lb/>
            or delight smile on the soul, it is soon confused and dis­ <lb/>

            the calm of a sunken rock.</p>

            curb on your insatiable desires, and rid yourself of fear and <lb/>
            anxiety, you are but pouring out wine for a man in a fever, <lb/>
            and giving honey to a man who is bilious, and laying out <lb/>
            a sumptuous banquet for people who are suffering from <lb/>
            dysentery, and can neither retain their food nor get <lb/>
            any benefit from it, but are made even worse by it. <lb/>
            Have you never observed how sick persons turn against <lb/>
            and spit out and refuse the daintiest and most costly <lb/>
            viands, though people offer them and almost force them <lb/>
            down their throats, but on another occasion, when their <lb/>
            condition is different, their respiration good, their blood in <lb/>
            a healthy state, and their natural warmth restored, they <lb/>
            get up, and enjoy and make a good meal of simple bread <lb/>
            and cheese and cress ? Such, also, is the effect of reason <lb/>
            on the mind. You will be contented, if you have learned <lb/>
            what is good and honourable. You will live daintily <lb/>
            and be a king in poverty, and enjoy a quiet and private <lb/>
            life as much as the public life of general or states­ <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>§ I. I propose to discuss what is called and appears to <lb/>
            be moral virtue (which differs mainly from contemplative <lb/>
            virtue in that it has emotion for its matter, and reason for <lb/>
            its form), what its nature is, and how it subsists, and <lb/>
            whether that part of the soul which takes it in is furnished <lb/>
            with reason of its own, or participates in something foreign, <lb/>
            and if the latter, whether as things that are mixed with <lb/>
            something better than themselves, or rather as that which <lb/>
            is subject to superintendence and command, and may be <lb/>
            said to share in the power of that which commands. For <lb/>
            I think it is clear that virtue can exist and continue alto­ <lb/>
            gether free from matter and mixture. My best course will <lb/>
            be to run briefly over the views of others, not so much to <lb/>
            display my research as because, when their ideas have been <lb/>
            set forth, mine will become more clear and be on a firmer <lb/>
            basis.</p>
          <p>§ II. Menedemus of Eretria took away the number and <lb/>
            differences of virtues, on the ground that virtue was one <lb/>
            though it had many names; for that just as mortal is <lb/>
            synonymous with man, so temperance and bravery and <lb/>
            justice were the same thing. And Aristo of Chios also <lb/>
            made virtue one in substance, and called it soundness of <lb/>
            mind : its diversities and varieties only existing in certain <lb/>
            relations, as if one called our sight when it took in white <lb/>
            objects white-sight, and when it took in black objects <lb/>
            black-sight, and so on. For virtue, when it considers what <lb/>
            it ought to do and what it ought not to do, is called <lb/>
            prudence ; and when it curbs passion, and sets a fit and <lb/>
            proper limit to pleasure, it is called self-control; and when <lb/>
            it is associated with our dealings and covenants with one <lb/>
            another, it is called justice ; just as a knife is one article, <lb/>
             <pb n="99"/>
            though at different times it cuts different things in half : <lb/>
            and so, too, fire acts on different matter though it has but <lb/>
            one property. And Zeno of Cittium seems to incline <lb/>
            somewhat to the same view, as he defines prudence in dis­ <lb/>
            tribution as justice, in choice as self-control, in endurance <lb/>
            is fortitude: and those who defend these views maintain <lb/>
            that by the term prudence Zeno means knowledge. But <lb/>
            Jhrysippus, thinking each particular virtue should be <lb/>
            arranged under its particular quality, unwittingly stirred <lb/>
            up, to use Plato's language, "a whole swarm of virtues,” 1 <lb/>
            unusual and unknown. For as from brave we get bravery, <lb/>
            and from mild mildness, and from just justice, so from <lb/>
            acceptable he got acceptableness, and from good good­ <lb/>
            ness, and from great greatness, and from the honourable <lb/>
            honourableness, and he made virtues of many other such <lb/>
            clevernesses, affabilities, and versatilities, and filled philo­ <lb/>
            sophy, which did not at all require it, with many strange <lb/>
            names.</p>
          <p>§ III. Now all these agree in supposing virtue to be a <lb/>
            disposition and faculty of the governing part of the soul <lb/>
            set in motion by reason, or rather to be reason itself con­ <lb/>
            formable and firm and immutable. They think further <lb/>
            that the emotional and unreasoning part of the soul is not <lb/>
            by any natural difference distinct from the reasoning part, <lb/>
            but that that same part of the soul, which they call intel­ <lb/>
            lect and the leading principle of action, being altogether <lb/>
            diverted and changed by the passions, and by the alterations <lb/>
            which habit or disposition have brought about, becomes <lb/>
            either vice or virtue, without having in itself any unreason­ <lb/>
            ing element, but that it is called unreasoning when, by the <lb/>
            strong and overpowering force of appetite, it launches out <lb/>
            into excesses contrary to the direction of reason. For <lb/>
            passion, according to them, is only vicious and intemperate <lb/>
            reason, getting its strength and power from bad and faulty <lb/>
            judgement. But all of those philosophers seem to have <lb/>
            been ignorant that we are all in reality two-fold and com­ <lb/>
            posite, though they did not recognize it, and only saw the <lb/>
            more evident mixture of soul and body. And yet that there <lb/>
            is in the soul itself something composite and two-fold and <note type="footnote"> 1 See " Meno," p. 72, A. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="100"/>
            dissimilar (the unreasoning part of it, as if another body, <lb/>
            being by necessity and nature mixed up with and united to <lb/>
            reason), seems not to have escaped the notice even of <lb/>
            Pythagoras, as we infer from his zeal for music, which be <lb/>
            introduced to calm and soothe the soul, as knowing that it <lb/>
            was not altogether amenable to precept and instruction, or <lb/>
            redeemable from vice only by reason, but that it needed <lb/>
            some other persuasion and moulding and softening influence <lb/>
            to co-operate with reason, unless it were to be altogether <lb/>
            intractable and refractory to philosophy. And Plato saw <lb/>
            very plainly and confidently and decidedly that the soul <lb/>
            of this universe is not simple or uncomposite or uniform, <lb/>
            but is made up of forces that work uniformly and differently, <lb/>
            in the one case it is ever marshalled in the same order and <lb/>
            moves about in one fixed orbit, in the other case it is <lb/>
            divided into motions and orbits contrary to each other and <lb/>
            changing about, and thus generates differences in things. <lb/>
            So, too, the soul of man, being a part or portion of the soul <lb/>
            of the universe, and compounded upon similar principles <lb/>
            and proportions, is not simple or entirely uniform, but has <lb/>
            one part intelligent and reasoning, which is intended by <lb/>
            nature to rule and dominate in man, and another part un­ <lb/>
            reasoning, and subject to passion and caprice, and dis­ <lb/>
            orderly, and in need of direction. And this last again is <lb/>
            divided into two parts, one of which, being most closely <lb/>
            connected with the body, is called desire, and the other, <lb/>
            sometimes taking part with the body, sometimes with <lb/>
            reason, lending its influence against the body, is called <lb/>
            anger. And the difference between reason and sense on <lb/>
            the one hand, and anger and desire on the other, is shown <lb/>
            by their antipathy to one another, so that they are often at <lb/>
            variance with one another as to what is best.1 These were <lb/>
            at first2 the views of Aristotle, as is clear from his writings, <lb/>
            though afterwards he joined anger to desire, as if anger <lb/>
            were nothing but a desire and passion for revenge. How­ <lb/>
            ever, he always considered the emotional and unreasoning <lb/>
            part of the soul as distinct from the reasoning, not that it <lb/>
            is altogether unreasoning as the perceptive, or nutritive, or <note type="footnote"> 1 Omitting <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕτερα</foreign>, which Reiske justly suspects. </note><note type="footnote"> * Reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρω̃τον</foreign> with Wyttenbach. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="101"/>
            vegetative portions of the soul, for these are always deaf <lb/>
            and disobedient to reason, and in a certain sense are off­ <lb/>
            shoots from the flesh, and altogether attached to the body; <lb/>
            but the emotional, though it is destitute of any reason of <lb/>
            its own, yet is naturally inclined to listen to reason and <lb/>
            sense, and turn and submit and mould itself accordingly, <lb/>
            unless it be entirely corrupted by brute pleasure and a life <lb/>
            of indulgence.</p>
          <p>§ IV. As for those who wonder that what is unreasoning <lb/>
            should obey reason, they do not seem to me to recognize <lb/>
            the power of reason, how great it is, and how far-reaching <lb/>
            its dominion is-a power not gained by harsh and repelling <lb/>
            methods, but by attractive ones, as mild persuasion which <lb/>
            always accomplishes more than compulsion or violence. <lb/>
            For even the spirit and nerves and bones, and other parts <lb/>
            of the body, though devoid of reason, yet at any instigation <lb/>
            of reason, when she shakes as it were the reins, are all on <lb/>
            the alert and compliant and obedient, the feet to run, and <lb/>
            the hands to throw or lift, at her bidding. Right excel­ <lb/>
            lently has the poet set forth in the following lines the <lb/>
            sympathy and accordance between the unreasoning and <lb/>
            reason :­ <lb/>
            “ Thus were her beauteous cheeks diffused with tears, <lb/>
            Weeping her husband really present then. <lb/>
            But though Odysseus pitied her in heart, <lb/>
            His eyes like horn or steel impassive stood <lb/>
            Within their lids, and craft his tears repressed.”1 <lb/>
            So completely under the control of judgement did he keep <lb/>
            his spirit and blood and tears. The same is shown by the <lb/>
            subsidence of our passions, which are laid to rest in the <lb/>
            presence of handsome women or boys, whom reason and <lb/>
            the law forbid us to touch ; a case which most frequently <lb/>
            happens to lovers, when they hear that they have unwit­ <lb/>
            tingly fallen in love with a sister or daughter. For at <lb/>
            once passion is laid at the voice of reason, and the body <lb/>
            exhibits its members as subservient to decorum. And fre­ <lb/>
            quently in the case of dainty food, people very much <lb/>
            attracted by it, if they find out at the time or learn after­ <lb/>
            wards that they have eaten what is unclean or unlawful, <note type="footnote"> 1 Homer, " Odyssey," xix. 208-212. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="102"/>
            not only suffer distress and grief in their imagination, but <lb/>
            even their very body is upset by the notion, and violent <lb/>
            retchings and vomitings follow.1 I fear I should seem to <lb/>
            be introducing merely novel and enticing arguments, if I <lb/>
            1 were to enumerate stringed instruments and lyres, and <lb/>
            harps and flutes, and other harmonious musical instruments, <lb/>
            which, although inanimate, yet speak to man's passions, <lb/>
            rejoicing with him, and mourning with him, and chiming <lb/>
            in with him, and rioting with him,—in a word, falling in <lb/>
            with the vein and emotions and characters of those that <lb/>
            play on them. And they say that Zeno on one occasion, <lb/>
            going into the theatre when Amœbeus 2 was playing on the <lb/>
            harp, said to the pupils, " Let us go and learn what music <lb/>
            can be produced by guts and nerves and wood and bones, <lb/>
            when they preserve proportion and time and order." But <lb/>
            passing these things over, I would gladly learn from them, <lb/>
            if, when they see dogs and horses and birds domes­ <lb/>
            ticated, and by habit and training uttering sounds that <lb/>
            can be understood, and making obedient movements and <lb/>
            gestures, and acting quietly and usefully to us, and when <lb/>
            they notice that Achilles in Homer cheers on horses as <lb/>
            well as men to the fight,3 they still wonder and doubt, <lb/>
            whether the passionate and emotional and painful and <lb/>
            pleasurable elements in us are by nature obedient to the <lb/>
            voice of reason, and influenced and affected by it, seeing <lb/>
            that those elements are not apart from us or detached from <lb/>
            us, or formed from outside, or hammered into us by force, <lb/>
            but are innate in us, and ever associate with us, and are <lb/>
            nourished within us, and abound in us through habit. <lb/>
            Accordingly moral character is well called by the Greeks <unclear/> <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ̃θος</foreign>, for it is, to speak generally, a quality of the unrea­ <lb/>
            soning element in man, and is called <unclear>ἡ̃θος</unclear> because the un­ <lb/>
            reasoning element moulded by reason receives this quality <lb/>
            and difference by habit, which is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔθος</foreign>.4 Not that <lb/>
            reason wishes to expel passion altogether (that is neither <note type="footnote"> 1 As in the story in "Gil Bias" of the person who, after eating a <lb/>

            possible, nor advisable), but only to keep it within bounds <lb/>
            and order, and to engender the moral virtues, which are <lb/>
            not apathetic, but hold the due proportion and mean in <lb/>
            regard to passion. And this she does by reducing the <lb/>
            power of passion to a good habit. For there are said to be <lb/>
            three things existing in the soul, power, passion, and habit. <lb/>
            Power is the principle or matter of passion, as power to be <lb/>
            angry, ashamed, or confident: and passion is the actual <lb/>
            setting in motion of that power, being itself anger, con­ <lb/>
            fidence, or shame; and habit is the strong formation of <lb/>
            power in the unreasoning element engendered by use, being <lb/>
            vice if the passions are badly tutored by reason, virtue if <lb/>
            they are well tutored.</p>
          <p>§ v. But since they do not regard every virtue as a <lb/>
            mean, nor call it moral, we must discuss this difference by <lb/>
            approaching the matter more from first principles. Some <lb/>
            things in the world exist absolutely, as the earth, the sky, <lb/>
            the stars, and the sea; others have relation to us, as good <lb/>
            and evil, as what is desirable or to be avoided, as pleasant <lb/>
            and painful: and since reason has an eye to both of these <lb/>
            classes, when it considers the former it is scientific and <lb/>
            contempt dive, when it considers the latter it is deliberative <lb/>
            and practical. And prudence is the virtue in the latter <lb/>
            case, as knowledge in the former. And there is this diffe­ <lb/>
            rence between prudence and knowledge, prudence consists <lb/>
            in applying the contemplative to the practical and emotional <lb/>
            so as to make reason paramount. On which account it <lb/>
            often needs the help of fortune; whereas knowledge needs <lb/>
            neither the help of fortune nor deliberation to gain its <lb/>
            ends: for it considers only things which are always the <lb/>
            same. And as the geometrician does not deliberate about <lb/>
            the triangle, as to whether its interior angles are together <lb/>
            equal to two right angles, for he knows it as a fact-and <lb/>
            deliberation only takes place in the case of things which <lb/>
            differ at different times, not in the case of things which <lb/>
            are certain and unchangeable—so the contemplative mind <lb/>
            having its scope in first principles, and things that are <lb/>
            fixed, and that ever have one nature which does not <lb/>
            admit of change, has no need for deliberation. But <lb/>
            prudence, which has to enter into matters full of obscurity <lb/>
            and confusion, frequently has to take its chance, and <lb/>
             <pb n="104"/>
            to deliberate about things which are uncertain, and, <lb/>
            in carrying the deliberation into practice, has to co- <lb/>
            operate with the unreasoning element, which comes to its <lb/>
            help, and is involved in its decisions, for they need an <lb/>
            impetus. Now this impetus is given to passion by the <lb/>
            moral character, an impetus requiring reason to regulate <lb/>
            it, that it may render moderate and not excessive help, and <lb/>
            at the seasonable time. For the emotional and unreasoning <lb/>
            elements are subject to motions sometimes too quick and <lb/>
            vehement, at other times too remiss and slow. And so <lb/>
            everything we do may be a success from one point of view, <lb/>
            but a failure from many points of view ; as to hit the mark <lb/>
            one thing only is requisite, but one may miss it in various <lb/>
            ways, as one may shoot beyond or too short. This then is <lb/>
            the function of practical reason following nature, to prevent <lb/>
            our passions going either too far or too short. For where <lb/>
            from weakness and want of strength, or from fear and <lb/>
            hesitation, the impetus gives in and abandons what is good, <lb/>
            there reason is by to stir it up and rekindle it; and where <lb/>
            on the other hand it goes ahead too fast and in disorder, <lb/>
            there it represses and checks its zeal. And thus setting <lb/>
            bounds to the emotional motions, it engenders in the un­ <lb/>
            reasoning part of the soul moral virtues, which are the <lb/>
            mean between excess and deficiency. Not that we can <lb/>
            say that all virtue exists in the mean, but knowledge and <lb/>
            prudence being in no need of the unreasoning element, <lb/>
            and being situated in the pure and unemotional part of the <lb/>
            soul, is a complete perfection and power of reason, whereby <lb/>
            we get the most divine and happy fruit of understanding. <lb/>
            But that virtue which is necessary because of the body, and <lb/>
            needs the help of the passions as an instrument towards the <lb/>
            practical, not destroying or doing away with but ordering <lb/>
            and regulating the unreasoning part of the soul, is per­ <lb/>
            fection as regards its power and quality, but in quantity is <lb/>
            is a mean correcting both excess and deficiency.</p>
          <p>§ vi. But since the word mean has a variety of meanings <lb/>
            -for there is one kind of mean compounded of two simple <lb/>
            extremes, as grey is the mean between white and black; <lb/>
            and there is another kind of mean, where that which con­ <lb/>
            tains and is contained is the mean between the containing <lb/>
            and contained, as eight is the mean between twelve and <lb/>
             <pb n="105"/>
            four; and there is a third kind of mean which has part in <lb/>
            neither extreme, as the indifferent is the mean between <lb/>
            good and bad,-virtue cannot be a mean in any of these <lb/>
            ways. For neither is it a mixture of vices, nor containing <lb/>
            that which is defective is it contained by that which is <lb/>
            excessive, nor is it again altogether free from emotional <lb/>
            storms of passion, wherein are excess and deficiency. But <lb/>
            it is, and is commonly so called, a mean like that in music <lb/>
            and harmony. For as in music there is a middle note <lb/>
            between the highest and lowest in the scale, which being <lb/>
            perfectly in tune avoids the sharpness of the one and the <lb/>
            flatness of the other; so virtue, being a motion and power <lb/>
            in the unreasoning part of the soul, takes away the remiss­ <lb/>
            ness and strain, aud generally speaking the excess and <lb/>
            defect of the appetite, by reducing each of the passions to <lb/>
            a state of mean and rectitude. For example, they tell us <lb/>
            that bravery is the mean between cowardice and foolhardi­ <lb/>
            ness, whereof the former is a defect, the latter an excess <lb/>
            of anger : and that liberality is the mean between stinginess <lb/>
            and prodigality : and that meekness is the mean between <lb/>
            insensibility and savageness : and so of temperance and <lb/>
            justice, that the latter, being concerned with contracts, is <lb/>
            to assign neither too much nor too little to litigants, and that <lb/>
            the former ever reduces the passions to the proper mean <lb/>
            between apathy (or insensibility) and gross intemperance. <lb/>
            This last illustration serves excellently to show us the <lb/>
            radical difference between the unreasoning and reasoning <lb/>
            parts of the soul, and to prove to us that passion and <lb/>
            reason are wide as the poles asunder. For the difference <lb/>
            would not be discernible between temperance and conti­ <lb/>
            nence, nor between intemperance and incontinence, in <lb/>
            pleasure and desires, if the appetite and judgement were in <lb/>
            the same portion of the soul. Now temperance is a state, <lb/>
            wherein reason holds the reins, and manages the passions <lb/>
            as a quiet and well-broken-in animal, finding them obedient <lb/>
            and submissive to the reins and masters over their desires. <lb/>
            Continence on the other hand is not driven by reason <lb/>
            without some trouble, not being docile but jibbing and <note type="footnote">1 I have adopted, it will be seen, the suggestion of Wyttenbach, <lb/>
            “ <foreign xml:lang="grc">τψ̃ λογισμψ̃</foreign> mutaudum videtur in <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸν χαλινόν</foreign>.” </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="106"/>
            kicking, like an animal compelled by bit and bridle and <lb/>
            whip and backing, being in itself full of struggles and com­ <lb/>
            motion. Plato explains this by his simile of the chariot- <lb/>
            horses of the soul, the worse one of which ever kicking <lb/>
            against the other and disturbing the charioteer, he is <lb/>
            obliged ever to hold them in with all his might, and to <lb/>
            tighten the reins, lest, to borrow the language of Simonides, <lb/>
            " he should drop from his hands the purple reins." And <lb/>
            so they do not consider continence to be an absolute virtue, <lb/>
            but something less than a virtue; for no mean arises from <lb/>
            the concord of the worse with the better, nor is the excess <lb/>
            of the passion curtailed, nor does the appetite obey or act <lb/>
            in unison with reason, but it both gives and suffers trouble, <lb/>
            and is constrained by force, and is as it were an enemy in a <lb/>
            town given up to faction. <lb/>
            " The town is full of incense, and at once <lb/>
            Resounds with triumph-songs and bitter wailing." 1 <lb/>
            Such is the state of soul of the continent person owing to <lb/>
            his conflicting condition. On the same grounds they con­ <lb/>
            sider incontinence to be something less than vice, but <lb/>
            intemperance to be a complete vice. For it, having both <lb/>
            its appetite and and reason depraved, is by the one carried <lb/>
            away to desire disgraceful things,2 by the other, through <lb/>
            bad judgement consenting to desire, loses even the percep­ <lb/>
            tion of wrongdoing. But incontinence keeps its judgement <lb/>
            sound through reason, but is carried away against its judge­ <lb/>
            ment by passion which is too strong for reason, whence it <lb/>
            differs from intemperance. For in the one case reason is <lb/>
            mastered by passion, in the other it does not even make a <lb/>
            fight against it, in the one case it opposes its desires even <lb/>
            when it follows them, in the other it is their advocate <lb/>
            and even leader, in the one case it gladly participates in <lb/>
            what is wrong, in the other sorrowfully, in the one case it <lb/>
            willingly rushes into what is disgraceful, in the other it <lb/>
            abandons the honourable unwillingly. And as there is a <lb/>
            difference in their deeds, so no less manifest is the difference <note type="footnote"> 1 Sophocles," (Edipus Tyrannus," 4, 5. Quoted by our author again <lb/>

             <pb n="107"/>
            in their language. For these are the expressions of the <lb/>
            intemperate. " What grace or pleasure in life is there <lb/>
            without golden Aphrodite ? May I die, when I care no <lb/>
            longer for these things !” And another says, " To eat, to <lb/>
            drink, to enjoy the gifts of Aphrodite is everything, for all <lb/>
            other things I look upon as supplementary," as if from <lb/>
            the bottom of his soul he gave himself up to pleasures, and <lb/>
            was completely subverted by them. And not less so he <lb/>
            who said, " Let me be ruined, it is best for me," had his <lb/>
            judgement diseased through his passion. But the sayings <lb/>
            of incontinence are quite different, as <lb/>
            " My nature forces me against ray judgement,”1 <lb/>
            and <lb/>
            " Alas! it is poor mortals' plague and bane, <lb/>
            To know the good, yet not the good pursue." 2 <lb/>
            And again­ <lb/>
            “My anger draws me on, has no control, <lb/>
            'Tis but a sandy hook against a tempest." <lb/>
            Here he compares not badly to a sandy hook, a sorry kind <lb/>
            of anchor, the soul that is unsettled and has no steady <lb/>
            reason, but surrenders judgment through flabbiness and <lb/>
            feebleness. And not unlike this image are the lines, <lb/>
            “ As some ship moored and fastened to the shore, <lb/>
            If the wind blows, the cables cannot hold it." <lb/>
            By cables he means the judgement which resists what is <lb/>
            disgraceful, though sometimes it gives way under a tre­ <lb/>
            mendous storm of passion. For indeed it is with full sail <lb/>
            that the intemperate man is borne on to pleasure by his <lb/>
            desires, and surrenders himself to them, and even plays <lb/>
            the part of pilot to the vessel ; whereas the incontinent <lb/>
            Yuan is dragged sidelong into the disgraceful, and is its vic­ <lb/>
            tim, as it were, while he desires eagerly to resist and over­ <lb/>
            come his passion, as Timon bantered Anaxarchus : " The <lb/>
            recklessness and frantic energy of Anaxarchus to rush any­ <lb/>
            where seemed like a dog's courage, but he being aware of <lb/>
            it was miserable, so people said, but his voluptuous nature <lb/>
            ever plunged him into excesses again, nature which even <note type="footnote"> 1 In the " Chrysippus " of Euripides, Fragm. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Compare Romans viii. 19. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="108"/>
            most sophists are afraid of." For neither is the wise man <lb/>
            continent but temperate, nor the fool incontinent but intem­ <lb/>
            perate ; for the one delights in what is good, and the other <lb/>
            is not vexed at what is bad. Incontinence, therefore, is a <lb/>
            mark of a sophistical soul, endued with reason which can­ <lb/>
            not abide by what it knows to be right.</p>
          <p>§ VII. Such, then, are the differences between inconti­ <lb/>
            nence and intemperance, and continence and temperance <lb/>
            have their counterpart and analogous differences; for re­ <lb/>
            morse and trouble and annoyance are companions of con­ <lb/>
            tinence, whereas in the soul of the temperate person there <lb/>
            is everywhere such equability and calm and soundness, by <lb/>
            which the unreasoning is adjusted and harmonized to <lb/>
            reason, being adorned with obedience and wonderful mild­ <lb/>
            ness, that looking at it you would say with the poet, " At <lb/>
            once the wind was laid, and a wondrous calm ensued, for <lb/>
            the god alloyed the fury of the waves,”1 reason having ex­ <lb/>
            tinguished the vehement and furious and frantic motions <lb/>
            of the desires, and making those which nature necessarily <lb/>
            requires sympathetic and obedient and friendly and co­ <lb/>
            operative in carrying purposes out in action, so that they <lb/>
            do not outrun or come short of reason, or behave disorderly <lb/>
            and disobediently, but that every appetite is tractable, " as <lb/>
            sucking foal runs by the side of its dam.”2 And this con­ <lb/>
            firms the saying of Xenocrates about true philosophers, <lb/>
            that they alone do willingly what all others do unwillingly <lb/>
            at the compulsion of the Jaw, as dogs are turned away from <lb/>
            their pleasures by a blow, or cats by a noise, looking at <lb/>
            nothing but their danger. It is clear then that there is <lb/>
            in the soul a perception of such a generic and specific <lb/>
            difference in relation to the desires, as of something fight­ <lb/>
            ing against and opposing them. But some say that there <lb/>
            is no radical distinction difference or variance between <lb/>
            reason and passion, but that there is a shifting of one and <lb/>
            the same reason from one to the other, which escapes our <lb/>
            notice owing to the sharpness and quickness of the change, <lb/>
            so that we do not see at a glance that desire and repent­ <lb/>
            ance, anger and fear, giving way to what is disgraceful <note type="footnote"> 1 " Odyssey," xii. 168, 169. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This line is from Simonides, and is quoted fgain in “How one may <lb/>

            through passion, and recovery from the same, are the same <lb/>
            natural property of the soul. For desire and fear and <lb/>
            anger and the like they consider only depraved opinions <lb/>
            and judgements, not in one portion of the soul only but in <lb/>
            all its leading principles, inclinations and yieldings, and <lb/>
            assents and impulses, and generally speaking in its energies <lb/>
            soon changed, like the sallies of children, whose fury and <lb/>
            excessive violence is unstable by reason of their weakness. <lb/>
            But these views are, in the first place, contrary to evidence <lb/>
            and observation; for no one observes in himself a change <lb/>
            from passion to judgement, and from judgement back to <lb/>
            passion ; nor does anyone cease from loving when he reflects <lb/>
            that it would be well to break the affair off and strive with <lb/>
            all his might against it; nor again, does he put on one side <lb/>
            reflection and judgement, when he gives way and is over­ <lb/>
            come by desire. Moreover, when he resists passion by <lb/>
            reason, he does not escape passion altogether; nor again, <lb/>
            when he is mastered by passion does he fail to discern his <lb/>
            fault through reason : so that neither by passion does he <lb/>
            abolish reason, nor does he by reason get rid of passion, but <lb/>
            is tossed about to and fro alternately between passion and <lb/>
            reason. And those who suppose that the leading principle <lb/>
            in the soul is at one time desire, and at another time reason <lb/>
            in opposition to desire, are not unlike people who would <lb/>
            make the hunter and the animal he hunts one and the same <lb/>
            person, but alternately changing from hunter to animal, <lb/>
            from animal to hunter. As their eyesight is plainly defi­ <lb/>
            cient, so these are faulty in regard to their perceptions, <lb/>
            seeing that they must perceive in themselves not a change <lb/>
            of one and the same thing, but a difference and struggle <lb/>
            between two opposing elements. " What then," say they, <lb/>
            “ does not the deliberative element in a man often hold <lb/>
            different views, and is it not swayed to different opinions as <lb/>
            to expediency, and yet it is one and the same thing ?" <lb/>
            Certainly, I reply; but the case is not similar. For the <lb/>
            rational part of the soul does not fight against itself, but <lb/>
            though it has only one faculty, it makes use of different <lb/>
            reasonings; or rather the reasoning is one, but employs <lb/>
            itself in different subjects as on different matter. And so <lb/>
            there is neither pain in reasonings without passion, nor are <lb/>
            men compelled, as it were, to choose something contrary to <lb/>
             <pb n="110"/>
            their judgement, unless indeed some passion, as in a balance, <lb/>
            secretly predominates in the scale. For this often happens, <lb/>
            reason not opposing reason, but ambition, or contention, or <lb/>
            favour, or jealousy, or fear opposing reason, that we do but <lb/>
            think there is a difference between two reasons, as in the line, <lb/>
            " They were ashamed to refuse, and feared to accept,”1 or, <lb/>
            " To die in battle is dreadful but glorious; but not to die, <lb/>
            though cowardly, is more pleasant." Moreover, in judge­ <lb/>
            ments about contracts passions come in and cause the <lb/>
            greatest delay; and in the councils of kings those who <lb/>
            speak to ingratiate themselves do not favour either of the <lb/>
            two cases, but give themselves up to passion without re­ <lb/>
            gard to what is expedient; and so those that rule in aris­ <lb/>
            tocracies do not allow orators to be pathetic in their plead­ <lb/>
            ings. For reasoning without passion has a direct tendency <lb/>
            to justice, while if passion is infused, a contest and diffe­ <lb/>
            rence is excited between pleasure and pain on the one hand, <lb/>
            and judgement and justice on the other. For otherwise <lb/>
            how is it that in philosophical speculations people are <lb/>
            with little pain frequently induced by others to change <lb/>
            their opinions, and even Aristotle himself and Democritus <lb/>
            and Chrysippus have rejected without trouble or pain, and <lb/>
            even with pleasure, some of the opinions which they for­ <lb/>
            merly advocated ? For no passion stands in the way in <lb/>
            the theoretic and scientific part of the soul, and the un­ <lb/>
            reasoning element is quiet and gives no trouble therein. <lb/>
            And so reason gladly inclines to the truth, when it is <lb/>
            evident, and abandons error; for in it, and not in passion, <lb/>
            lies a willingness to listen to conviction and to change <lb/>
            one's opinions on conviction. But the deliberations and <lb/>
            judgements and arbitrations of most people as to matters of <lb/>
            fact being mixed up with passion, give reason no easy or <lb/>
            pleasant access, as she is held fast and incommoded by the <lb/>
            unreasonable, which assails her through pleasure, or fear, <lb/>
            or pain, or desire. And the decision in these cases lies <lb/>
            with sense which has dealings with both passion and <lb/>
            reason, for if one gets the better of the other the other is <lb/>
            not destroyed, but only dragged along by force in spite of <lb/>
            its resistance. For he who is dissatisfied with himself for <note type="footnote"> I " Iliad," vii. 93. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="111"/>
            falling in love calls in reason to his aid to overcome his <lb/>
            passion, for both reason and passion are in his soul, and he <lb/>
            perceives they are contrary one to the other, and violently <lb/>
            represses the inflammatory one of the two. On the other <lb/>
            hand, in deliberations and speculations without passion <lb/>
            (such as the contemplative part of the soul is most con. <lb/>
            versant with), if they are evenly balanced no decision takes <lb/>
            place, but the matter is left in doubt, which is a sort of <lb/>
            stationary position of the mind in conflicting arguments. <lb/>
            But should there be any inclination to one of the two sides, <lb/>
            the most powerful opinion carries the day, yet without giv­ <lb/>
            ing pain or creating hostility. And, generally speaking, <lb/>
            when reason seems opposed to reason, there is no percep­ <lb/>
            tion of two distinct things, but only of one under different <lb/>
            phases, whereas when the unreasoning has a controversy <lb/>
            with reason, since there can be no victory or defeat with­ <lb/>
            out pain, forthwith they tear the soul in two,1 and make the <lb/>
            difference between them apparent.</p>
          <p>§ VIlI. And not only from their contest, but quite as <lb/>
            much from their agreement, can we see that the source of <lb/>
            the passions is something quite distinct from that of reason. <lb/>
            For since2 one may love either a good and excellent child <lb/>
            or a bad and vicious one, and be unreasonably angry with <lb/>
            one's children or parents, yet in behalf of them show a just <lb/>
            anger against enemies or tyrants ; as in the one case there <lb/>
            is the perception of a difference and struggle between pas­ <lb/>
            sion and reason, so in the other there is a perception of <lb/>
            persuasion and agreement inclining, as it were, the scale, and <lb/>
            giving their help. Moreover a good man marrying a wife <lb/>
            according to the laws is minded to associate and live with <lb/>
            her justly and soberly, but as time goes on, his intercourse <lb/>
            with her having engendered a strong passion for her, he <lb/>
            perceives that his love and affection are increased by reason. <lb/>
            Just so, again, young fellows falling in with kindly teachers <lb/>
            at first submit themselves to them out of necessity and <lb/>
            emulation for learning, but end by loving them, and instead <lb/>
            of being their pupils and scholars become and get the titleof <lb/>
            their lovers. The same is the case in cities in respect to good <note type="footnote"> 1 Reading with Reiskp, <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὶς δύο</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπεὶ</foreign> with Reiske and Wyttenbach. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="112"/>
            magistrates, and neighbours, and connections by marriage; <lb/>
            for beginning at first to associate with one another from <lb/>
            necessity and propriety, they afterwards go on to love <lb/>
            almost insensibly, reason drawing over and persuading the <lb/>
            emotional element. And he who said­ <lb/>
            " There are two kinds of shame, the one not bad, <lb/>
            The other a sad burden to a family,”1 <lb/>
            is it not clear that he felt this emotion in himself often <lb/>
            contrary to reason and detrimental by hesitation and delay <lb/>
            to opportunities and actions ?</p>
          <p>§ ix. In a certain sense yielding to the force of these <lb/>
            arguments, they call shame modesty, pleasure joy, and <lb/>
            timidity caution; nor would anyone blame them for this <lb/>
            euphemism, if they only gave those specious names to the <lb/>
            emotions that are consistent with reason, while they gave <lb/>
            other kinds of names to those emotions that resist and do <lb/>
            violence to reason. But whenever, though convicted by <lb/>
            their tears and tremblings and changes of colour, they avoid <lb/>
            the terms pain and fear, and speak of bitings and states of <lb/>
            excitement, and gloss over the passions by calling them <lb/>
            inclinations, they seem to contrive evasions and flights from <lb/>
            facts by names sophistical, and not philosophical. And <lb/>
            yet again they seem to use words rightly when they call <lb/>
            those joys and wishes and cautions not apathies but good <lb/>
            conditions of the mind. For it is a happy disposition of <lb/>
            the soul when reason does not annihilate passion, but orders <lb/>
            and arranges it in the case of temperate persons. But what <lb/>
            is the condition of worthless and incontinent persons, who, <lb/>
            when they judge they ought to love their father and <lb/>
            mother better than some boy or girl they are enamoured <lb/>
            of, yet cannot, and yet at once love their mistress or flat­ <lb/>
            terer, when they judge they ought to hate them ? For if <lb/>
            passion and judgement were the same thing, love and hate <lb/>
            would immediately follow the judging it right to love and <lb/>
            hate, whereas the contrary happens, passion following some <lb/>
            judgements, but declining to follow others. Wherefore <lb/>
            they acknowledge, the facts compelling them to do so, that <lb/>
            every judgement is not passion, but only that judgement <lb/>
            that is provocative of violent and excessive impulse: ad- <note type="footnote"> 1 Euripides, " Hippolytus " 385, 386. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="113"/>
            mitting that judgement and passion in us are something <lb/>
            different, as what moves is different from what is moved. <lb/>
            Even Chrysippus himself, by his defining in many places <lb/>
            endurance and continence to be habits that follow the lead <lb/>
            of reason, proves that he is compelled by the facts to admit, <lb/>
            that that element in us which follows absolutely is some­ <lb/>
            thing different from that which follows when persuaded, <lb/>
            but resists when not persuaded.</p>
          <p>§ x. Now as to those who make all sins and offences <lb/>
            equal, it is not now the occasion to discuss if in other <lb/>
            respects they deviate from truth: but as regards the pas­ <lb/>
            sions 1 they seem to go clean contrary to reason and evi­ <lb/>
            dence. For according to them every passion is a sin, and <lb/>
            everyone who grieves, or fears, or desires, commits sin. <lb/>
            But in good truth it is evident that there are great diffe­ <lb/>
            rences between passions, according as one is more or less <lb/>
            affected by them. For who would say that the craven <lb/>
            fear of Dolon 2 was not something very different from the <lb/>
            fear of Ajax, " who retreated with his face to the enemy and <lb/>
            at a foot's pace, drawing back slowly knee after knee " ? 3 <lb/>
            Or who would say that the grief of Plato at the death of <lb/>
            Socrates was identical with the grief of Alexander at the <lb/>
            death of Clitus, when he attempted to lay violent hands on <lb/>
            himself ? For grief is beyond measure intensified by falling <lb/>
            out against expectation : and the calamity that comes un­ <lb/>
            looked for is more painful than that we may reasonably fear: <lb/>
            as if when expecting to see one's friend basking in pros­ <lb/>
            perity and admiration, one should hear that he had been put <lb/>
            to the torture, as Parmenio heard about Philotas. And who <lb/>
            would say that the anger of Magas against Philemon was <lb/>
            equal to that of Nicocreon against Anaxarchus ? Both <lb/>
            Magas and Nicocreon had been insulted, but whereas <lb/>
            Nicocreon brayed Anaxarchus to death with iron pestles <lb/>
            and made mincemeat of him, Magas contented himself with <lb/>
            bidding the executioner lay his naked sword on Philemon's <lb/>
            neck, and then let him go.' And so Plato called anger the <note type="footnote"> 1 Reading with Reiske <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάθεσι</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλείοσι</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> a See " Iliad," x. 374, sq. 3 “Iliad,” xi. 547. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 " De Anaxarchi supplicio nota res. v.

            nerves of the mind, since it can be both intensified by <lb/>
            bitterness, and slackened by mildness. To evade these <lb/>
            and similar arguments, they deny that intensity and excess <lb/>
            of passion are according to judgement, wherein is the pro­ <lb/>
            pensity to fault, but maintain that they are bites and con­ <lb/>
            tractions and diffusings capable of increase or diminution <lb/>
            through the unreasoning element. And yet it is evident <lb/>
            that there are differences as regards judgements; for some <lb/>
            judge poverty to be no evil, while others judge it to be a <lb/>
            great evil, and others again the very greatest evil, insomuch <lb/>
            that they even throw themselves headlong down rocks and <lb/>
            into the sea on account of it. Again as to death, some think <lb/>
            it an evil only in depriving us of good things, whereas <lb/>
            others think it so in regard to eternal punishments and <lb/>
            awful torments in the world below. Health again is valued <lb/>
            by some as natural and advantageous, while to others it <lb/>
            seems the greatest blessing of life, in comparison with <lb/>
            which they reckon little either of wealth or children or <lb/>
            " royal power that makes one equal to the gods," and at last <lb/>
            come to think even virtue useless and unprofitable, if health <lb/>
            be absent. Thus it is clear that even with regard to judge­ <lb/>
            ments themselves some err more, some less. But I shall <lb/>
            bring no further proof of this now, but this one may assume <lb/>
            therefrom, that they themselves concede that the unreason­ <lb/>
            ing element is something different from judgement, in that <lb/>
            they allow that by it passion becomes greater and more <lb/>
            violent, and while they quarrel about the name and word <lb/>
            they give up the thing itself to those who maintain that <lb/>
            the emotional and unreasoning part of the soul is distinct <lb/>
            from the reasoning and judging element. And in his <lb/>
            treatise on Anomaly,1 Chrysippus, after telling us that <lb/>
            anger is blind, and frequently does not let one see what is <lb/>
            obvious, frequently also obscures what we do get a sight <lb/>
            of, goes on to say, " The encroachment of the passions blots <lb/>
            out reason, and makes things look different to what they <lb/>
            should look, violently forcing people on unreasonable acts." <lb/>
            And he quotes as witness Menander, who says, " Alas ! <note type="footnote"> 1 “Celebres fuere quondam Chrysippi sex libri <foreign xml:lang="grc">περὶ τη̃ς κατὰ τἀς λήξεις <lb/>
            ἀνωμαλίας</foreign>, in quibus auctore Varrone, propositum habuit ostendere, <lb/>

            poor me, wherever were my brains in my body at the time <lb/>
            when I chose that line of conduct, and not this ? " And <lb/>
            Chrysippus proceeds, " Though every living creature en­ <lb/>
            dowed with reason is naturally inclined to use reason and <lb/>
            to be governed by it on every occasion, yet often do we <lb/>
            reject it, being borne away by a more violent impulse; " <lb/>
            thus admitting what results from the difference between <lb/>
            passion and reason. For otherwise it is ridiculous, as <lb/>
            Plato says, to argue that a man is sometimes better than <lb/>
            himself, sometimes worse, sometimes master of himself, <lb/>
            sometimes not master of himself.</p>
          <p>§ xi. For how is it possible that the same person can be <lb/>
            both better and worse than himself, both master of himself <lb/>
            and not master, unless everyone is in some way twofold, <lb/>
            having in himself both a better and worse self ? For so he <lb/>
            that makes the baser element subject to the better has self- <lb/>
            control and is a superior man, whereas he who allows the <lb/>
            nobler element of the soul to follow and be subservient to <lb/>
            the incorrigible and unreasoning element, is inferior to <lb/>
            what he might be, and is called incontinent, and is in an <lb/>
            unnatural condition. For by nature it appertains to reason, <lb/>
            which is divine, to rule and govern the unreasoning ele­ <lb/>
            ment, which has its origin from the body, which it also <lb/>
            naturally resembles and participates in its passions, being <lb/>
            placed in it and mixed up with it, as is proved by the im­ <lb/>
            pulses to bodily delights, which are always fierce or languid <lb/>
            according to the changes of the body. And so it is that <lb/>
            young men are keen and vehement in their desires, being <lb/>
            red hot and raging from their fulness of blood and animal <lb/>
            heat, whereas with old men the liver, which is the seat of <lb/>
            desire, is dried up and weak and feeble, and reason has more <lb/>
            power with them than passion which decays with the body. <lb/>
            This principle also no doubt characterizes the nature of <lb/>
            animals as regards the sexual appetite. For it is not of <lb/>
            course from any fitness or unfitness of opinions, that some <lb/>
            animals are so bold and resolute in the presence of danger, <lb/>
            while others are helpless and full of fear and trembling; but <lb/>
            this difference of emotion is produced by the workings of the <lb/>
            blood and spirit and body, the emotional part growing out <lb/>
            of the flesh, as from a root, and carrying along with it its <lb/>
            quality and temperament. And that the body of man <lb/>
             <pb n="116"/>
            sympathizes with and is affected by the emotional impulses <lb/>
            is proved by pallors, and blushings, and tremblings, and <lb/>
            palpitations of the heart, as on the other hand by an all­ <lb/>
            pervading joy in the hope and expectation of pleasures. <lb/>
            But whenever the mind is by itself and unmoved by pas­ <lb/>
            sion, the body is in repose and at rest, having no partici­ <lb/>
            pation or share in the working of the intellect, unless it <lb/>
            involve the emotional, or the unreasoning element call it <lb/>
            in. So that it is clear that there are two distinct parts of <lb/>
            the soul differing from one another in their faculties.</p>
          <p>§ XII. And generally speaking of all existing things, as <lb/>
            they themselves admit and is clear, some are governed by <lb/>
            nature, some by habit, some by an unreasoning soul, some <lb/>
            by a soul that has reason and intelligence. Man too par­ <lb/>
            ticipates in all this, and is subject to all those differences <lb/>
            here mentioned, for he is affected by habit, and nourished by <lb/>
            nature, and uses reason and intelligence. He has also a <lb/>
            share of the unreasoning element, and has the principle of <lb/>
            passion innate in him, not as a mere episode in his life but <lb/>
            as a necessity, which ought not therefore to be entirely <lb/>
            rooted out, but requires care and attention. For the <lb/>
            function of reason is no Thracian or Lycurgean one to root <lb/>
            up and destroy all the good elements in passion indis­ <lb/>
            criminately with the bad, but, as some genial and mild <lb/>
            god, to prune what is wild, and to correct disproportion, <lb/>
            and after that to train and cultivate the useful part. For <lb/>
            as those who are afraid to get drunk do not pour on the <lb/>
            ground their wine, but mix it with water, so those who are <lb/>
            afraid of the disturbing element in passion do not eradicate <lb/>
            passion altogether but temper it. Similarly with oxen and <lb/>
            horses people try to restrain their mad bounds and restive­ <lb/>
            ness, not their movements and powers of work, and so <lb/>
            reason makes use of the passions when they have become <lb/>
            tame and docile, not by cutting out the sinews or altogether <lb/>
            mutilating the serviceable part of the soul. For as Pindar <lb/>
            says, “ The horse to the chariot, and the ox to the plough, <lb/>
            while he that meditates destruction for the boar must find a <lb/>
            staunch hound.”1 But much more useful than these are <lb/>
            the whole tribe of passions when they wait on reason and <note type="footnote"> I Compare “ On Contentedness of Mind," § xiii. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="117"/>
            run parallel to virtue. Thus moderate anger is useful to <lb/>
            courage, and hatred of evil to uprightness, and righteous <lb/>
            indignation against those who are fortunate beyond their <lb/>
            deserts, when they are inflamed in their souls with folly <lb/>
            and insolence and need a check. And no one if they wished <lb/>
            could pluck away or sever1 natural affection from friend­ <lb/>
            ship, or pity from philanthropy, or sympathy both in joy <lb/>
            and grief from genuine good-will. And if those err who <lb/>
            wish to banish love because of erotic madness, neither are <lb/>
            they right who blame all desire because of love of money, <lb/>
            but they act like people who refuse to run because they <lb/>
            might stumble, or to throw because they might throw wide <lb/>
            of the mark, or object to sing altogether because they might <lb/>
            make a false note. For as in sounds music does not create <lb/>
            melody by the banishment of sharps and flats, and as in <lb/>
            bodies the art of the physician procures health not by the <lb/>
            doing away of cold and heat but by their being blended in <lb/>
            due proportions and quantities, so is victory won in the <lb/>
            soul by the powers and motions of the passions being <lb/>
            reduced by reason to moderation and due proportion.. For <lb/>
            excessive grief or fear or joy in the soul (I speak not of mere <lb/>
            joy grief or fear), resembles a body swollen or inflamed. <lb/>
            And Homer when he says excellently, <lb/>
            “ The brave man's colour never changes, nor <lb/>
            Is he much frightened,”1 <lb/>
            does not take away all fear but only excessive fear, that <lb/>
            bravery may not become recklessness, nor confidence fool­ <lb/>
            hardiness. So also in regard to pleasure we must do away <lb/>
            with excessive desire, and in regard to vengeance with <lb/>
            excessive hatred of evil. For so in the former case one <lb/>
            will not be apathetic but temperate, and in the latter one <lb/>
            will not be savage or cruel but just. But if the passions <lb/>
            were entirely removed, supposing that to be possible, <lb/>
            reason would become in many duller and blunter, like the <lb/>
            pilot in the absence of a storm. And no doubt it is from <lb/>
            having noticed this that legislators try to excite in states <lb/>
            ambition and emulation among their townsmen, and stir up <lb/>
            and increase their courage and pugnacity against enemies <note type="footnote"> 1 Reading with Reiske, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀποῤῥήξειεν</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> a "Iliad,” xiii. 284, 285. </note> <lb/>

            by the sound of trumpets and flutes. For it is not only in <lb/>
            poems, as Plato says, that he that is inspired by the Muses, <lb/>
            and as it were possessed by them, will laugh to shame the <lb/>
            plodding artist, but also in fighting battles passion and en­ <lb/>
            thusiasm will be irresistible and invincible, such as Homer <lb/>
            makes the gods inspire men with, as in the line, <lb/>
            “ Thus speaking he infused great might in Hector, <lb/>
            The shepherd of the people. 1 <lb/>
            and, <lb/>
            “ He is not mad like this without the god,"2 <lb/>
            as if the god had added passion to reason as an incitement <lb/>
            and spur. And you may see those very persons, whose <lb/>
            opinions I am combating, frequently urging on the young <lb/>
            by praises, and frequently checking them by rebukes, <lb/>
            though pleasure follows the one, pain the other. For <lb/>
            rebukes and censure produce repentance and shame, the <lb/>
            one bringing grief, the other fear, and these they mostly <lb/>
            make use of for purposes of correction. And so Diogenes, <lb/>
            when Plato was being praised, said, " What has he to vaunt <lb/>
            of, who has been a philosopher so long, and yet never gave <lb/>
            pain to anyone ? " For one could not say, to use the words <lb/>
            of Xenocrates, that the mathematics are such handles to <lb/>
            philosophy as are the emotions of young men, such as shame, <lb/>
            desire, repentance, pleasure, pain, ambition, whereon reason <lb/>
            and the law laying a suitable grip succeed in putting the <lb/>
            young man on the right road. So that it was no bad remark <lb/>
            of the Lacedæmonian tutor, that he would make the boy <lb/>
            entrusted to his charge pleased with what was good and <lb/>
            displeased with what was bad,3 for a higher or nobler aim <lb/>
            cannot be proposed in the education fit for a freeborn lad.</p>

          <p>§ I. What amount of argument, Sossius Senecio, will <lb/>
            make a man know that he is improving in respect to virtue, <note type="footnote"> 1 “Iliad,” xv. 262. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 " Iliad,”v. ] 85. </note> <note type="footnote"> 3 Compare “ That Virtue may be Taught," § ii. </note> <lb/>

            if his advances in it do not bring about some diminution <lb/>
            in folly, but vice, weighing equally with all his good inten­ <lb/>
            tions, " acts like the lead that makes the net go down ?”1 <lb/>
            For neither in music nor grammatical knowledge could <lb/>
            anyone recognize any improvement, if he remained as <lb/>
            unskilful in them as before, and had not lost some of his <lb/>
            old ignorance. Nor in the case of anyone ill would medical <lb/>
            treatment, if it brought no relief or ease, by the disease <lb/>
            somewhat yielding and abating, give any perception of <lb/>
            improvement of health, till the opposite condition was corn - <lb/>
            pletely brought about by the body recovering its full <lb/>
            strength. But just as in these cases there is no improve­ <lb/>
            ment unless, by the abatement of what weighs them down <lb/>
            till they rise in the opposite scale, they recognize a <lb/>
            change, so in the case of those who profess philosophy no <lb/>
            improvement or sign of improvement can be supposed, <lb/>
            unless the soul lay aside and purge itself of some of its <lb/>
            imperfection, and if it continue altogether bad until it <lb/>
            become absolutely good and perfect. For indeed a wise <lb/>
            man cannot in a moment of time change from absolute <lb/>
            badness to perfect goodness, and suddenly abandon for <lb/>
            ever all that vice, of which he could not during a long <lb/>
            period of time divest himself of any portion. And yet you <lb/>
            know, of course, that those who maintain these views fre­ <lb/>
            quently give themselves much trouble and bewilderment <lb/>
            about the difficulty, that a wise man does not perceive <lb/>
            that he has become wise, but is ignorant and doubtful <lb/>
            that in a long period of time by little and little, by remov­ <lb/>
            ing some things and adding others, there will be a secret <lb/>
            and quiet improvement, and as it were passage to virtue. But <lb/>
            if the change were so great and sudden that the worst man <lb/>
            in the morning could become the best man at night, or <lb/>
            should the change so happen that he went to bed vicious <lb/>
            and woke up in the morning wise, and, having dismissed <lb/>
            from his mind all yesterday's follies and errors, should say, <lb/>
            "False dreams, away, you had no meaning then!"2 <lb/>
            who on earth could be ignorant of so great a change <lb/>
            happening to himself, of virtue blazing forth so completely <note type="footnote"> 1 See Erasmus, Adagia, “ Eadem pensari trutina." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Euripides, " Iphigenia in Tauris," 569. </note> <lb/>

            all at once P I myself am of opinion that anyone, like <lb/>
            Caeneus,1 who, according, to his prayer, got changed from <lb/>
            a woman into a man, would sooner be ignorant of the <lb/>
            transformation, than that a man should become at once, <lb/>
            from a cowardly and senseless person with no powers of <lb/>
            self-control, brave and sensible and perfect master of him­ <lb/>
            self, and should in a moment change from a brutish life to <lb/>
            a divine without being aware of it.</p>
          <p>§ II. That was an excellent observation, Measure the <lb/>
            stone by the mason's rule, not the rule by the stoned But <lb/>
            the Stoics, not applying dogmas to facts but facts to their <lb/>
            own preconceived opinions, and forcing things to agree <lb/>
            that do not by nature, have filled philosophy with many <lb/>
            difficulties, the greatest of which is that all men but the <lb/>
            perfect man are equally vicious, which has produced the <lb/>
            enigma called progress, one little short of extreme folly, <lb/>
            since it makes those who have not at once under its <lb/>
            guidance given up all passions and disorders equally un­ <lb/>
            fortunate as those who have not got rid of a single vile <lb/>
            propensity. However they are their own confuters, for <lb/>
            while they lay down in the schools that Aristides was as <lb/>
            unjust as Phalaris, and Brasidas as great a craven as Dolon, <lb/>
            and Plato actually as senseless as Meletus, in life and its <lb/>
            affairs they turn away from and avoid one class as implac­ <lb/>
            able, while they make use of the others and trust them in <lb/>
            most important matters as most worthy people.</p>
          <p>§ III. But we who see that in every kind of evil, but <lb/>
            especially in a disordered and unsettled state of mind, there <lb/>
            are degrees of more and less (so that the progress made <lb/>
            differs in different cases, badness abating, as a shadow <lb/>
            flees away, under the influence of reason, which calmly <lb/>
            illuminates and cleanses the soul), cannot consider it un­ <lb/>
            reasonable to think that the change will be perceived, as <lb/>
            people who come up out of some ravine can take note of <lb/>
            the progress they make upwards. Look at the case from <lb/>
            the following point of view first. Just as mariners sailing <lb/>
            with full sail over the gaping3 ocean measure the course <note type="footnote"> 1 See Ovid, " Metamorphoses," xii. 189, sq. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 See Erasmus, " Adagia," p. 1103. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Compare Shakspere, “ Tempest,” A. i. Se. i. 63, " And gape at <lb/>
            widest to glut him." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="121"/>
            they have made by the time they have taken and the force <lb/>
            of the wind, and compute their progress accordingly, so <lb/>
            anyone can compute his progress in philosophy by his con­ <lb/>
            tinuous and unceasing course, by his not making many <lb/>
            halts on the road, and then again advancing by leaps and <lb/>
            bounds, but by his quiet and even and steady march forward <lb/>
            guided by reason. For the words of the poet, "If to a <lb/>
            little you keep adding a little, and do so frequently, it will <lb/>
            soon be a lot, are not only true of the increase of money, <lb/>
            but are universally applicable, and especially to increase in <lb/>
            virtue, since reason invokes to her aid the enormous force <lb/>
            of habit. On the other hand the inconsistencies and dul­ <lb/>
            nesses of some philosophers not only check advance, as it <lb/>
            were, on the road, but even break up the journey altogether, <lb/>
            since vice always attacks at its leisure and forces back <lb/>
            whatever yields to it.2 The mathematicians tell us that <lb/>
            planets, after completing their course, become stationary; <lb/>
            but in philosophy there is no such intermission or stationary <lb/>
            position from the cessation of progress, for its nature is ever <lb/>
            to be moving and, as it were, to be weighed in the scales, <lb/>
            sometimes being overweighted by the good preponderating, <lb/>
            sometimes by the bad. If, therefore, imitating the oracle <lb/>
            given to the Amphictyones by the god, " to fight against the <lb/>
            people of Cirrha every day and every night,”3 you are con­ <lb/>
            scious that night and day you ever maintain a fierce fight <lb/>
            against vice, not often relaxing your vigilance, or long off <lb/>
            your guard, or receiving as heralds to treat of peace' the <lb/>
            pleasures, or idleness, or stress of business, you may reason­ <lb/>
            ably go forward to the future courageously and confidently.</p>
          <p>§ IT. Moreover, if there be any intermissions in philo­ <lb/>
            sophy, and yet your later studies are firmer and more con­ <lb/>
            tinuous than your former ones, it is no bad indication that <lb/>
            your sloth has been expelled by labour and exercise ; for the <lb/>
            contrary is a bad sign, when after a short time your lapses <note type="footnote"> 1 Hesiod, " Works and Days," 361,362. Quoted again by our author, <lb/>

            from zeal become many and continuous, as if your zeal were <lb/>
            dying away. For as in the growth of a reed, which shoots up <lb/>
            from the ground finely and beautifully to an even and con- . <lb/>
            tinuous height, though at first from its great intervals it is <lb/>
            hindered and baffled in its growth, and afterwards through <lb/>
            its weakness is discouraged by any breath of air, and <lb/>
            though strengthened by many and frequent joints, yet a <lb/>
            violent wind gives it commotion and trembling, so those who <lb/>
            at first make great launches out into philosophy, and after­ <lb/>
            wards find that they are continually hindered and baffled, <lb/>
            and cannot perceive that they make any progress, finally <lb/>
            get tired of it and cry off. " But he who is as it were <lb/>
            winged," 1 is by his simplicity borne along to his end, and <lb/>
            by his zeal and energy cuts through impediments to his <lb/>
            progress, as merely obstacles on the road. As it is a sign <lb/>
            of the growth of violent love, not so much to rejoice in <lb/>
            the presence of the loved one, for everyone does that, <lb/>
            as to be distressed and grieved at his absence,2 so many <lb/>
            feel a liking for philosophy and seem to take a wonderful <lb/>
            interest in the study, but if they are diverted by other <lb/>
            matters and business their passion evaporates and they take <lb/>
            it very easily. " But whoever is strongly smitten with love <lb/>
            for his darling ” 3 will show his mildness and agreeableness <lb/>
            in the presence of and joint pursuit of wisdom with the loved <lb/>
            one, but if he is drawn away from him and is not in his <lb/>
            company you will see him in a stew and ill at ease and <lb/>
            peevish whether at work or leisure, and unreasonably for­ <lb/>
            getful of his friends, and wholly impelled by his passion <lb/>
            for philosophy. For we ought not to rejoice at discourses <lb/>
            only when we hear them, as people like perfumes only when <lb/>
            they smell them, and not to seek or care about them in <lb/>
            their absence, but in the same condition as people who are <lb/>
            hungry and thirsty are in if torn away from food and drink, <lb/>
            we ought to follow after true proficiency in philosophy, <lb/>
            whether marriage, or wealth, or friendship, or military ser­ <lb/>
            vice, strike in and produce a separation. For just as more <note type="footnote"> 1 From Homer, " Iliad," xix. 386. </note><figure type="illustration">

              is to be got from philosophy, so much the more does what <lb/>
              we fail to obtain trouble us.</p>
          <p>§ v. Either precisely the same as this or very similar is <lb/>
            Hesiod's1 very ancient definition of progress in virtue, <lb/>
            namely, that the road is no longer very steep or arduous, <lb/>
            but easy and smooth and level, its roughness being toned <lb/>
            down by exercise, and casting the bright light of philosophy <lb/>
            on doubt and error and regrets, such as trouble those who <lb/>
            give themselves to philosophy at the outset, like people who <lb/>
            leave a land they know, and do not yet descry the land they <lb/>
            are sailing to. For by abandoning the common and <lb/>
            familiar, before they know and apprehend what is better, <lb/>
            they frequently flounder about in the middle and are fain <lb/>
            to return. As they say the Roman Sextius, giving up for <lb/>
            philosophy all his honours and offices in Rome, being after­ <lb/>
            wards discontented with philosophy from the difficulties he <lb/>
            met with in it at first, very nearly threw himself out of <lb/>
            window. Similarly they relate of Diogenes of Sinope,2 <lb/>
            when he began to be a philosopher, that the Athenians <lb/>
            were celebrating a festival, and there were public banquets <lb/>
            and shows and mutual festivities, and drinking and re­ <lb/>
            velling all night, and he, coiled up in a corner of the market- <lb/>
            place intending to sleep, fell into a train of thought likely <lb/>
            seriously to turn him from his purpose and shake his <lb/>
            resolution, for he reflected that he had adopted without <lb/>
            any necessity a toilsome and unusual kind of life, and by <lb/>
            his own fault sat there debarred of all the good things. At <lb/>
            that moment, however, they say a mouse stole up and be­ <lb/>
            gan to munch some of the crumbs of his barley-cake, and <lb/>
            he plucked up his courage and said to himself, in a railing <lb/>
            and chiding fashion, "What say you, Diogenes? Do <lb/>
            your leavings give this mouse a sumptuous meal, while <lb/>
            you, the gentleman, wail and lament because you are <lb/>
            not getting drunk yonder and reclining on soft and <lb/>
            luxurious couches ? " Whenever such depressions of mind <lb/>
            are not frequent, and the mind when they take place quickly <lb/>
            recovers from them, after having put them to flight as it <lb/>
            were, and when such annoyance and distraction is easily <note type="footnote"> 1 See Hesiod, " Works and Days," 289-292. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The well-known Cynic philosopher. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="124"/>
            got rid of, then one may consider one's progress in virtue <lb/>
            as a certainty.</p>
          <p>§ vi. And since not only the things that in themselves <lb/>
            shake and turn them in the opposite direction are more <lb/>
            powerful in the case of weak philosophers, but also the <lb/>
            serious advice of friends, and the playful and jeering objec­ <lb/>
            tions of adversaries bend and soften people, and have ere <lb/>
            now shaken some out of philosophy altogether, it will be no <lb/>
            slight indication of one's progress in virtue if one takes <lb/>
            all this very calmly, and is neither disturbed nor aggravated <lb/>
            by people who tell us and mention to us that some of <lb/>
            our former comrades are flourishing in kings' courts, or <lb/>
            have married wives with dowries, or are attended by a <lb/>
            crowd of friends when they come down to the forum <lb/>
            to solicit some office or advocateship. He that is not <lb/>
            moved or affected by all this is already plainly one upon <lb/>
            whom philosophy has got a right hold; for it is impossible <lb/>
            that we should cease to be envious of what most people <lb/>
            admire, unless the admiration of virtue was strongly im­ <lb/>
            planted in us. For over-confidence may be generated in <lb/>
            some by anger and folly, but to despise what men admire is <lb/>
            not possible without a true and steady elevation of mind. <lb/>
            And so people in such a condition of mind, comparing it with <lb/>
            that of others, pride themselves on it, and say with Solon, <lb/>
            " We would not change virtue for wealth, for while virtue <lb/>
            abides,wealth changes hands, and now one man, now another, <lb/>
            has it."1 And Diogenes compared his shifting about from <lb/>
            Corinth to Athens, and again from Thebes to Corinth, to <lb/>
            the different residences of the King of Persia, as his spring <lb/>
            residence at Susa, his winter residence at Babylon, and his <lb/>
            summer residence in Media. And Agesilaus said of the <lb/>
            great king, " How is he better than me, if he is not more <lb/>
            upright ? ” And Aristotle, writing to Antipater about <lb/>
            Alexander, said, " that he ought not to think highly of <lb/>
            himself because he had many subjects, for anyone who had <lb/>
            right notions about the gods was entitled to think quite <lb/>
            as highly of himself.,, And Zeno, observing that Theo­ <lb/>
            pbrastus was admired for the number of his pupils,2 said, <note type="footnote"> 1 Bergk. fr. 15. Compare Homer, "Iliad," vi. 339. <foreign xml:lang="grc">νίκη δ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπαμείβεται <lb/>

            " His choir is, I admit, larger than mine, but mine is more <lb/>
            harmonious."</p>
          <p>§ VII. Whenever then, by thus comparing the advantages <lb/>
            of virtue with external things, you get rid of envies and <lb/>
            jealousies and those things which fret and depress the minds <lb/>
            of many who are novices in philosophy, this also is a great <lb/>
            indication of your progress in virtue. Another and no slight <lb/>
            indication is a change in the style of your discourses. For <lb/>
            generally speaking all novices in philosophy adopt most such <lb/>
            as tend to their own glorification; some, like birds, in their <lb/>
            levity and ambition soaring to the height and brightness of <lb/>
            physical things ; others like young puppies, as Plato1 says, <lb/>
            rejoicing in tearing and biting, betake themselves to strifes <lb/>
            and questions and sophisms; but most plunging themselves <lb/>
            into dialectics immediately store themselves for sophistry ; <lb/>
            and some collect sentences3 and histories and go about (as <lb/>
            Anacharsis said he saw the Greeks used money for no other <lb/>
            purpose but to count it up), merely piling up and comparing <lb/>
            them, but making no practical use of them. Applicable <lb/>
            here is that saying of Antiphanes, which someone applied <lb/>
            to Plato's pupils. Antiphanes said playfully that in a <lb/>
            certain city words were frozen directly they were spoken, <lb/>
            owing to the great cold, and were thawed again in the <lb/>
            summer, so that one could then hear what had been said in <lb/>
            the winter. So he said of the words which were spoken by <lb/>
            Plato to young men, that most of them only understood <lb/>
            them late in life when they were become old men. And <lb/>
            this is the condition people are in in respect to all philoso­ <lb/>
            phy, until the judgement gets into a sound and healthy state, <lb/>
            and begins to adapt itself to those things which can produce <lb/>
            character and greatness of mind, and to seek discourses <lb/>
            whose footsteps turn inwards rather than outwards, to <lb/>
            borrow the language of Æsop.3 For as Sophocles said he <lb/>
            had first toned down the pompous style of Æschylus, then <lb/>
            his harsh and over-artificial method, and had in the third <note type="footnote"> 1 “ Republic,” vii. p. 539, B. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Sentences borrowed from some author or other, such as we still <lb/>

            place changed his manner of diction, a most important point <lb/>
            and one that is most intimately connected with the <lb/>
            character, so those who go in for philosophy, when they <lb/>
            have passed from flattering and artificial discourses to such <lb/>
            as deal with character and emotion, are beginning to make <lb/>
            genuine and modest progress in virtue.</p>
          <p>§ vInI. Furthermore, take care, in reading the writings of <lb/>
            philosophers or hearing their speeches, that you do not <lb/>
            attend to words more than things, nor get attracted more <lb/>
            by what is difficult and curious than by what is serviceable <lb/>
            and solid and useful. And also, in studying poems or <lb/>
            history, let nothing escape you of what is said to the point, <lb/>
            which is likely either to correct the character or to calm <lb/>
            the passions. For as Simonides says the bee hovers among <lb/>
            the flowers " making the yellow honey,”1 while others value <lb/>
            and pluck flowers only for their beauty and fragrance, <lb/>
            so of all that read poems for pleasure and amusement he <lb/>
            alone that finds and gathers what is valuable seems capable <lb/>
            of knowledge from his acquaintance with and friendship <lb/>
            for what is noble and good.2 For those who study Plato <lb/>
            and Xenophon only for their style, and cull out only what <lb/>
            is pure and Attic, and as it were the dew and the bloom, do <lb/>
            they not resemble people who love drugs for their smell <lb/>
            and colour, but care not for them as anodynes or purges, <lb/>
            and are not aware of those properties ? Whereas those who <lb/>
            have more proficiency can derive benefit not from dis­ <lb/>
            courses only, but from sights and actions, and cull what is <lb/>
            good and useful, as is recorded of Æschylus and other <lb/>
            similar kind of men. As to AEschylus, when he was <lb/>
            watching a contest in boxing at the Isthmus, and the whole <lb/>
            theatre cried out upon one of the boxers being beaten, he <lb/>
            nudged with his elbow Ion of Chios, and said, " Do you <lb/>
            observe the power of training ? The beaten man holds his <lb/>
            peace, while the spectators cry out." And Brasidas having <lb/>
            caught hold of a mouse among some figs, being bitten by it <lb/>
            let it go, and said to himself, " Hercules, there is no <lb/>
            creature so small or weak that it will not fight for its life !" <note type="footnote"> 1 This passage is alluded to also in “ On Love to one's Offspring.” <lb/>
            § ii. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Madvig's text. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="127"/>
            And Diogenes, seeing a lad drinking water out of the palm <lb/>
            of his hand, threw away the cup which he kept in his <lb/>
            wallet. So much does attention and assiduous practice <lb/>
            make people perceptive and receptive of what contributes <lb/>
            to virtue from any source. And this is the case still more <lb/>
            with those who mix discourses with actions, who not only, <lb/>
            to use the language of Thucydides,1 it exercise themselves <lb/>
            in the presence of danger," but also in regard to pleasures <lb/>
            and strifes, and judgements, and advocateships, and magis­ <lb/>
            trateships make a display of their opinions, or rather form <lb/>
            their opinions by their practice. For we can no more think <lb/>
            those philosophers who are ever learning and busy and in­ <lb/>
            vestigating what they have got from philosophy, and then <lb/>
            straightway publish it in the market-place or in the haunt <lb/>
            of young men, or at a royal supper-party, any more than we <lb/>
            give the name of physicians to those who sell drugs and <lb/>
            mixtures. Nay rather such a sophist differs very little at <lb/>
            all from the bird described in Homer,2 offering his scholars <lb/>
            like it whatever he has got, and as it feeds its callow young <lb/>
            from its own mouth, " though it goes ill with itself," so <lb/>
            he gets no advantage or food from what he has got for <lb/>
            himself.</p>
          <p>§ ix. We must therefore see to it that our discourse be <lb/>
            serviceable to ourselves, and that it may not appear to <lb/>
            others to be vain-glorious or ambitious, and we must show <lb/>
            that we are as willing to listen as to teach, and especially <lb/>
            must we lay aside all disputatiousness and love of strife <lb/>
            in controversy, and cease bandying fierce words with one <lb/>
            another as if we were contending with one another at <lb/>
            boxing, and leave off rejoicing more in smiting and knock­ <lb/>
            ing down one another than in learning and teaching. For <lb/>
            in such cases moderation and mildness, and to commence <lb/>
            arguing without quarrelsomeness and to finish without get­ <lb/>
            ting into a rage, and neither to be insolent if you come off <lb/>
            best in the argument, nor dejected if you come off worst, is <lb/>
            a sufficient sign of progress in virtue. Aristippus was an ex­ <lb/>
            cellent example of this, when overcome in argument by the <note type="footnote"> 1 Thucydides, i. 18. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Homer, " Iliad,” ix. 323, 324. Quoted also in “ On Love to One's <lb/>
            Offspring,” § ii. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="128"/>
            sophistry of a man, who had plenty of assurance, but was <lb/>
            generally speaking mad or balf-witted. Observing that he <lb/>
            was in great joy and very puffed up at his victory, he said, <lb/>
            "I who have been vanquished in the argument shall have <lb/>
            a better nights rest than my victor." We can also test <lb/>
            ourselves in regard to public speaking, if we are not timid <lb/>
            and do not shrink from speaking when a large audience has <lb/>
            unexpectedly been got together, nor dejected when we have <lb/>
            only a small one to harangue to, and if we do not, when we <lb/>
            have to speak to the people or before some magistrate, miss <lb/>
            the opportunity through want of proper preparation; for <lb/>
            these things are recorded both of Demosthenes and Alci­ <lb/>
            biades. As for Alcibiades, though he possessed a most excellent <lb/>
            understanding, yet from want of confidence in speaking he <lb/>
            often broke down, and in trying to recall a word or thought <lb/>
            that slipped his memory had to stop short.1 And Homer <lb/>
            did not deny that his first line was unmetrical,2 though he <lb/>
            had sufficient confidence to follow it up by so many other <lb/>
            lines, so great was his genius. Much more then ought <lb/>
            those who aim at virtue and what is noble to lose no <lb/>
            opportunity of public speaking, paying very little attention <lb/>
            to either uproar or applause at their speeches.</p>
          <p>§ x. And not only ought each to see to his discourses <lb/>
            but also to his actions whether he regards utility more <lb/>
            than show, and truth more than display. For if a genuine <lb/>
            love for youth or maiden seeks no witnesses, but is con­ <lb/>
            tent to enjoy its delights privately, far more does it become <lb/>
            the philosopher and lover of the beautiful, who is con­ <lb/>
            versant with virtue through his actions, to pride himself on <lb/>
            his silence, and not to need people to praise or listen to <lb/>
            him. As that man who called his maid in the house, and <lb/>
            cried out to her, “ See, Dionysia, I am angry no longer,”3 <lb/>
            so he that does anything agreeable and polite, and then <lb/>
            goes and spreads it about the town, plainly shows that he <lb/>
            looks for public applause and has a strong propensity to <lb/>
            vain-glory, and as yet has no acquaintance with virtue as <lb/>
            a reality but only as a dream, restlessly roving about amid <note type="footnote"> I The remark about Demosthenes has somehow slipped out, as <lb/>

            phantoms and shadows, and making a display of whatever <lb/>
            he does as painters display a picture. It is therefore a sign <lb/>
            of progress in virtue not merely to have given to a friend <lb/>
            or done a good turn to an acquaintance without mention­ <lb/>
            ing it to other people, but also to have given an honest vote <lb/>
            among many unjust ones, and to have withstood the dis­ <lb/>
            honourable request of some rich man or of some man in <lb/>
            office, and to have been above taking bribes, and, by Zeus, <lb/>
            to have been thirsty all night and not to have drunk, or, <lb/>
            like Agesilaus,1 to have resisted, though strongly tempted, <lb/>
            the kiss of a handsome youth or maiden, and to have kept <lb/>
            the fact to oneself and, been silent about it. For one's <lb/>
            being satisfied with one's own good opinion2 and not <lb/>
            despising it, but rejoicing in it and acquiescing in it as <lb/>
            competent to see and decide on what is honourable, proves <lb/>
            that reason is rooted and grounded within one, and that, to <lb/>
            borrow the language of Democritus, one is accustomed to <lb/>
            draw one's delights from oneself. And just as farmers <lb/>
            behold with greater pleasure those ears of corn which bend <lb/>
            and bow down to the ground, while they look upon those <lb/>
            that from their lightness stand straight upright as empty <lb/>
            pretenders, so also among those young men who wish to <lb/>
            be philosophers those that are most empty and without <lb/>
            any solidity show the greatest amount of assurance in their <lb/>
            appearance and walk, and a face full of haughtiness and <lb/>
            contempt that looks down on everybody, but when they <lb/>
            begin to grow full and get some fruit from study they lay <lb/>
            aside their proud and vain3 bearing. And just as in <lb/>
            vessels that contain water the air is excluded, so with men <lb/>
            that are full of solid merit their pride abates, and their <lb/>
            estimate of themselves becomes a lower one, and they cease <lb/>
            to plume themselves on a long beard and threadbare cloak,4 <lb/>
            and transfer their training to the mind, and are most severe <lb/>
            and austere to themselves, while they are milder in their <lb/>
            intercourse with everybody else; and they do not as before <note type="footnote"> 1 Compare our Author, De Audiendis Poctis, § xi. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὥσπερ ὁ</foreign> ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αγησίλαος <lb/>

            eagerly snatch at the name and reputation of philosopher, nor <lb/>
            do they write themselves down as such, but even if he were <lb/>
            addressed by that title by anyone else, an ingenuous young <lb/>
            man would say, smiling and blushing, "I am not a god: why <lb/>
            do you liken me to the immortals ? " 1 For as AEschylus <lb/>
            says, <lb/>
            " I never can mistake the burning eye <lb/>
            Of the young woman that has once known man,”2 <lb/>
            so to the young man who has tasted of true progress in philo­ <lb/>
            sophy the following lines of Sappho are applicable, "My <lb/>
            tongue cleaves to the roof of my mouth, and a fire courses <lb/>
            all over my lean body," and his eye will be gentle and mild, <lb/>
            and you would desire to hear him speak. For as those who <lb/>
            are initiated come together at first with confusion and noise <lb/>
            and jostle one another, but when the mysteries are being <lb/>
            performed and exhibited, they give their attention with awe <lb/>
            and silence, so also at the commencement of philosophy you <lb/>
            will see round its doors much confusion and assurance and <lb/>
            prating, some rudely and violently jostling their way to <lb/>
            reputation, but be who once enters in, and sees the great <lb/>
            light, as when shrines are open to view, assumes another <lb/>
            air and is silent and awe-struck, and in humility and <lb/>
            decorum follows reason as if she were a god. And the <lb/>
            playful remark of Menedemus seems to suit these very <lb/>
            well. He said that the majority of those who went to <lb/>
            school at Athens became first wise, and then philosophers, <lb/>
            after that orators, and as time went on became ordinary <lb/>
            kind of people, the more they had to do with learning, so <lb/>
            much the more laying aside their pride and high estimate <lb/>
            of themselves.</p>

            his assistance at their own home, others who are melan­ <lb/>
            choly or crazy or delirious will not sometimes even see the <lb/>
            doctor if he comes to their house, but drive him away, or <lb/>
            avoid him, ignorant through their grievous disease that <lb/>
            they are diseased at all. Similarly of those who have done <note type="footnote"> 1 " Odyssey,” xvi. 187. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Æschylus,“Toxotides," Fragm. 224. Quoted again by our author, <lb/>

            what is wrong some are incorrigible, being hostile and in­ <lb/>
            dignant and furious at those who reprove and admonish <lb/>
            them, while others are meeker and bear and allow reproof. <lb/>
            Now, when one has done what is wrong, to offer one­ <lb/>
            self for reproof, toexpose the case and reveal one's wrong­ <lb/>
            doing, and not to rejoice if it lies hid, or be satisfied if it is <lb/>
            not known, but to make confession of it and ask for inter­ <lb/>
            ference and admonishment, is no small indication of pro­ <lb/>
            gress in virtue. And so Diogenes said that one who wished <lb/>
            to do what was right ought to seek either a good friend or <lb/>
            red-hot enemy, that either by rebuke or mild entreaty he <lb/>
            might flee from vice. But as long as anyone, making a <lb/>
            display of dirt or stains on his clothes, or a torn shoe, prides <lb/>
            himself to outsiders on his freedom from arrogance, and, <lb/>
            by Zeus, thinks himself doing something very smart if be <lb/>
            jeers at himself as a dwarf or hunchback, but wraps up <lb/>
            and conceals as if they were ulcers the inner vileness of <lb/>
            his soul and the deformities of his life, as his envy, his <lb/>
            malignity, his littleness, his love of pleasure, and will not <lb/>
            let anyone touch or look at them from fear of disgrace, <lb/>
            such a one has made little progress in virtue, yea rather <lb/>
            none. But he that joins issue with his vices, and shows <lb/>
            that he himself is even more pained and grieved about <lb/>
            them than anyone else, or, what is next best, is able and <lb/>
            willing to listen patiently to the reproof of another and to <lb/>
            correct his life accordingly, he seems truly to be disgusted <lb/>
            at his depravity and resolute to divest himself of it. We <lb/>
            ought certainly to be ashamed of and shun every appear­ <lb/>
            ance of vice, but he who is more put about by his vice itself <lb/>
            than by the bad reputation that ensues upon it, will not <lb/>
            mind either hearing it spoken against or even speaking <lb/>
            against it himself if it make him a better man. That was <lb/>
            a witty remark of Diogenes to a young man, who when <lb/>
            seen in a tavern retired into the kitchen : " The more," said <lb/>
            he, "you retire, the more are you in the tavern." 1 Even <lb/>
            so the more a vicious man denies his vice, the more does it <note type="footnote"> I “Turpe habitum fuisse in caupona conspici, et hocexemplo apparet, <lb/>

            insinuate itself and master him : as those people really <lb/>
            poor who pretend to be rich get still more poor from their <lb/>
            false display. But he who is really making progress in <lb/>
            virtue imitates Hippocrates, who confessed publicly and <lb/>
            put into black and white that he had made a mistake about <lb/>
            the sutures of the skull,1 for he will think it monstrous, if <lb/>
            that great man declared his mistake, that others might not <lb/>
            fall into the same error, and yet he himself for his own <lb/>
            deliverance from vice cannot bear to be shown he is in <lb/>
            the wrong, and to confess his stupidity and ignorance. <lb/>
            Moreover the sayings of Bion and Pyrrho will test not so <lb/>
            much one's progress as a greater and more perfect habit of <lb/>
            virtue. Bion maintained that his friends might think they <lb/>
            had made progress, when they could listen as patiently <lb/>
            to abuse as to such language as the following, " Stranger, <lb/>
            you look not like a bad or foolish person," 2 " Health and <lb/>
            joy go with you, may the gods give you happiness!"8 <lb/>
            While as to Pyrrho they say, when he was at sea and in <lb/>
            peril from a storm, that he pointed out a little pig that was <lb/>
            quietly enjoying some grain that had been scattered about, <lb/>
            and said to his companions that the man who did not wish <lb/>
            to be disturbed by the changes and chances of life should <lb/>
            attain a similar composedness of mind through reason and <lb/>
            philosophy.</p>
          <p>§ XII. Look also at the opinion of Zeno, who thought <lb/>
            that everybody might gauge his progress in- virtue by his <lb/>
            dreams, if he saw himself in his dreams pleasing himself <lb/>
            with nothing disgraceful, and neither doing nor wishing to <lb/>
            do anything dreadful or unjust, but that, as in the clear <lb/>
            depths of a calm and tranquil sea, his fancy and passions <lb/>
            were plainly shown to be under the control of reason. And <lb/>
            this had not escaped the notice of Plato,4 it seems, who had <lb/>
            earlier expressed in form and outline the part that fancy <lb/>
            and unreason played in sleep in the soul that was by nature <lb/>
            tyrannical, " for it attempts incest," he says, " with its <lb/>
            mother, and procures for itself unlawful meats, and gives <note type="footnote"> I Wyttenbach compares Quintilian, ‟ Institut. Orat." iii. 6, p. 255: <lb/>

            itself up to the most abandoned desires, such as in daytime <lb/>
            the law through shame and fear debars people from." As <lb/>
            then beasts of burden that have been well-trained do not, <lb/>
            even if their driver let go the reins, attempt to turn aside <lb/>
            and leave the proper road, but go forward orderly as usual, <lb/>
            pursuing their way without stumbling, so those whose un­ <lb/>
            reason has become obedient and mild and tempered by <lb/>
            reason, will not easily wish, either in dreams or in illnesses, <lb/>
            to deal insolently or lawlessly through their desires, but <lb/>
            will keep to their usual habits, which acquire their power <lb/>
            and force by attention. For if the body can by training <lb/>
            make itself and its members so subject to control, that the <lb/>
            eyes in sorrow can refrain from tears, and the heart from pal­ <lb/>
            pitating in fear, and the passions can be calm in the presence <lb/>
            of beautiful youths and maidens, is it not far more likely <lb/>
            that the training of the passions and emotions of the soul <lb/>
            will allay, tame down, and mould their propensities even <lb/>
            in dreams ? A story is told about the philosopher Stilpo,l <lb/>
            that he thought he saw in a dream Poseidon angry with <lb/>
            him because he had not sacrificed an ox to him, as was <lb/>
            usual among the Megarians:2 and that he, not a bit fright­ <lb/>
            ened, said, " What are you talking about, Poseidon ? Do <lb/>
            you come here as a peevish boy, because I have not with <lb/>
            borrowed money filled the town with the smell of sacrifice, <lb/>
            and have only sacrificed to you out of what I had at home <lb/>
            on a modest scale ? " Then he thought that Poseidon <lb/>
            smiled at him, and held out his right hand, and said that <lb/>
            for his sake he would give the Megarians a large shoal of <lb/>
            anchovies. Those, then, that have such pleasant, clear, and <lb/>
            painless dreams, and no frightful, or harsh, or malignant, or <lb/>
            untoward apparition, may be said to have reflections of their <lb/>
            progress in virtue; whereas agitation and panics and ignoble <lb/>
            flights, and boyish delights, and lamentations in the case <lb/>
            of sad and strange dreams, are like the waves that break <lb/>
            on the coast, the soul not having yet got its proper com­ <lb/>
            posure, but being still in course of being moulded by <lb/>
            opinions and laws, from which it escapes in dreams as far <note type="footnote"> 1 A somewhat similar story about Stilpo is told in Athenæus, x. p. <lb/>

            as possible, so that it is once again set free and open to the <lb/>
            passions. Do you investigate all these points too, as to <lb/>
            whether they are signs of progress in virtue, or of some. <lb/>
            habit which has already a settled constancy and strength <lb/>
            through reason.</p>
          <p>§ XIII. Now since entire freedom from the passions is a <lb/>
            great and divine thing, and progress in virtue seems, as <lb/>
            we say, to consist in a certain remissness and mildness of <lb/>
            the passions, we must observe the passions both in them­ <lb/>
            selves and in reference to one another to gauge the diffe­ <lb/>
            rence : in themselves as to whether desire, and fear, and <lb/>
            rage are less strong in us now than formerly, through our <lb/>
            quickly extinguishing their violence and heat by reason; <lb/>
            and in reference to one another as to whether we are ani­ <lb/>
            mated now by modesty more than by fear, and by emulation <lb/>
            more than by envy, and by love of glory rather than by love <lb/>
            of riches, and generally speaking whether—to use the <lb/>
            language of musicians-it is in the Dorian more than in <lb/>
            the Lydian measures that we err either by excess or de­ <lb/>
            ficiency,1 whether we are plainer in our manner of living <lb/>
            or more luxurious, whether we are slower in action or <lb/>
            quicker, whether we admire men and their discourses <lb/>
            more than we should or despise them. For as it is a good <lb/>
            sign in diseases if they turn aside from vital parts of the <lb/>
            body, so in the case of people who are making progress in <lb/>
            virtue, when vice seems to shift to milder passions, it is a <lb/>
            sign it will soon die out. When Phrynis added to the seven <lb/>
            chords two chords more, the Ephors asked him which he <lb/>
            preferred to let them cut off, the upper or lower ones ;2 so <lb/>
            we must cut off both above and below, if we mean to attain <lb/>
            to the mean and to due proportion : for progress in virtue <lb/>
            first diminishes the excess and sharpness of the passions, <lb/>
            ‟ That sharpness for which madmen are so vehement," <lb/>
            as Sophocles says.</p>
          <p>§ xiv. I have already said that it is a very great indica­ <lb/>
            tion of progress in virtue to transfer our judgement to action, <note type="footnote"> 1 Adopting the suggestion of Wyttenbach as to the reading. The <lb/>
            Dorian measure was grave and severe, the Lydian soft and effeminate. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 See our author, " Apophthegmata Laconica," p. 220 C. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="135"/>
            and not to let our words remain merely words, but to make <lb/>
            deeds of them. A manifestation of this is in the first place <lb/>
            emulation as regards what we praise, and a zeal to do what <lb/>
            we admire, and an unwillingness either to do or allow what <lb/>
            we censure. To illustrate my meaning by an example, it <lb/>
            is probable that all Athenians praised the daring and bravery <lb/>
            of Miltiades; but Themistocles alone said that the trophy of <lb/>
            Miltiades would not let him sleep, but woke him up of a <lb/>
            night, and not only praised and admired him, but manifestly <lb/>
            emulated and imitated his glorious actions. Small, therefore, <lb/>
            can we think the progress we have made, as long as our <lb/>
            admiration for those who have done noble things is barren, <lb/>
            and does not of itself incite us to imitate them. For as there <lb/>
            is no strong love without jealousy, so there is no ardent and <lb/>
            energetic praise of virtue, which does not prick and goad <lb/>
            one on, and make one not envious but emulous of what is <lb/>
            noble, and desirous to do something similar. For not only <lb/>
            at the discourses of a philosopher ought we, as Alcibiades <lb/>
            said,1 to be moved in heart and shed tears, but the true <lb/>
            proficient in virtue, comparing his own deeds and actions <lb/>
            with those of the good and perfect man, and grieved at the <lb/>
            same time at the knowledge of his own deficiency, yet <lb/>
            rejoicing in hope and desire, and full of impulses that will <lb/>
            not let him rest, is, as Simonides says, <lb/>
            " Like sucking foal running by side of dam," a <lb/>
            being desirous all but to coalesce with the good man. For <lb/>
            it is a special sign of true progress in virtue to love and <lb/>
            admire the disposition of those whose deeds we emulate, <lb/>
            and to resemble them with a good-will that ever assigns <lb/>
            due honour and praise to them. But whoever is steeped <lb/>
            in contentiousness and envy against his betters, let him <lb/>
            know that he may be pricked on by a jealous desire for <lb/>
            glory or power, but that he neither honours nor admires <lb/>
            virtue.</p>
          <p>§ xv. Whenever, then, we begin so much to love good <lb/>
            men that we deem happy, "not only," as Plato <unclear>3</unclear> says, <lb/>
            " the temperate man himself, but also the man who hears <note type="footnote"> 1 Plato, " Symposium," p. 25, E. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This line is quoted again by our author, ‟ On Moral Virtue," § vii. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Plato," "Laws," iv. p. 711, E. </note> <lb/>

            the words that flow from his wise lips," and even admire <lb/>
            and are pleased with his figure and walk and look and <lb/>
            smile, and desire to adapt ourselves to his model and <lb/>
            to stick closely to him, then may we think that we are <lb/>
            making genuine progress. Still more will this be the case, <lb/>
            if we admire the good not only in prosperity, but like lovers <lb/>
            who admire even the lispings and paleness of those in their <lb/>
            flowery as the tears and dejection of Panthea in her grief <lb/>
            and affliction won the affections of Araspes,2 so we fear <lb/>
            neither the exile of Aristides, nor the prison of Anaxagoras, <lb/>
            nor the poverty of Socrates, nor the condemnation of <lb/>
            Phocion, but think virtue worthy our love even under such <lb/>
            trials, and join her, ever chanting that line of Euripides, <lb/>
            " Unto the noble everything is good." 3 <lb/>
            For the enthusiasm that can go so far as not to be dis­ <lb/>
            couraged at the sure prospect of trouble, but admires and <lb/>
            emulates what is good even so, could never be turned away <lb/>
            from what is noble by anybody. Such men ever, whether <lb/>
            they have some business to transact, or have taken upon them <lb/>
            some office, or are in some critical conjuncture, put before <lb/>
            their eyes the example of noble men, and consider what <lb/>
            Plato would have done on the occasion, what Epaminondas <lb/>
            would have said, how Lycurgus or Agesilaus would have <lb/>
            dealt; that so, adjusting and re-modelling themselves, as <lb/>
            it were, at their mirrors, they may correct any ignoble <lb/>
            expression, and repress any ignoble passion. For as those <lb/>
            that have learnt the names of the Idæan Dactyli4 make use <lb/>
            of them to banish their fear by quietly repeating them <lb/>
            over, so the bearing in mind and remembering good men, <lb/>
            which soon suggests itself forcibly to those who have made <lb/>
            some progress in virtue in all their emotions and difficulties, <lb/>

            then be a sign to you of progress in virtue.</p>

            nor to blush, nor to try and conceal oneself, or make any <lb/>
            change in one's dress, on the sudden appearance of a <lb/>
            man of distinction and virtue, but to feel confident and <lb/>
            go and meet such a one, is the confirmation of a good <lb/>
            conscience. It is reported that Alexander, seeing a mes­ <lb/>
            senger running up to him full of joy and holding out his <lb/>
            right hand, said, " My good friend, what are you going to <lb/>
            tell me? Has Homer come to life again?" For he thought <lb/>
            that his own exploits required nothing but posthumous <lb/>
            fame.1 And a young man improving in character instinc­ <lb/>
            tively loves nothing better than to take pride and pleasure <lb/>
            in the company of good and noble men, and to display his <lb/>
            house, his table, his wife, his amusements, his serious pur­ <lb/>
            suits, his spoken or written discourses; insomuch that he <lb/>
            is grieved when he remembers that his father or guardian <lb/>
            died without seeing him in that condition in life, and would <lb/>
            pray for nothing from the gods so much, as that they could <lb/>
            come to life again, and be spectators of his life and <lb/>
            actions; as, on the contrary, those that have neglected <lb/>
            their affairs, and come to ruin, cannot look upon their <lb/>
            relatives even in dreams without fear and trembling.</p>
          <p>§ XVII. Add, if you please, to what I have already said, <lb/>
            as no small indication of progress in virtue, the thinking no <lb/>
            wrong-doing small, but being on your guard and heed <lb/>
            against all. For as people who despair of ever being rich <lb/>
            make no account of small expenses, thinking they will <lb/>
            never make much by adding little to littJe,2 but when <lb/>
            hope is nearer fruition, then with wealth increases the love of <lb/>
            it,3 so in things that have respect to virtue, not he that <lb/>
            generally assents to such sayings as " Why trouble about <lb/>
            hereafter ? " ‟ If things are bad now, they will some day be <lb/>
            better, but the man who pays heed to everything, and is <lb/>
            vexed and concerned if vice gets pardon, when it lapses into <lb/>
            even the most trifling wrongdoing, plainly shows that he has <note type="footnote"> 1 Such as Homer could have brought. Compare Horace, " Odes," <lb/>

            already attained to some decree of purity, and deigns not to <lb/>
            contract defilement from anything whatever. For the idea <lb/>
            that we have nothing of any importance to bring disgrace <lb/>
            upon, makes people inclined to what is little and careless.1 To <lb/>
            those who are building a stone wall or coping it matters not <lb/>
            if they lay on any chance wood or common stone, or some <lb/>
            tombstone that has fallen down, as bad workmen do, heaping <lb/>
            and piling up pell-mell every kind of material; but those <lb/>
            who have made some progress in virtue, whose life " has <lb/>
            been wrought on a golden base,” 2 like the foundation of <lb/>
            some holy or royal building, undertake nothing carelessly, <lb/>
            but lay and adjust everything by the line and level of <lb/>
            reason, thinking the remark of Polycletus superlatively <lb/>

            and painless leisure. But nowadays courtiers, and people <lb/>
            who think they have a tarn for affairs, thrust themselves <lb/>
            forward of their own accord uninvited into courts and <lb/>
            toilsome escorts and bivouacs, that they may get a horse, <lb/>
            or brooch, or some such piece of good luck. ‘ But his wife <lb/>
            is left behind in Phylace, and tears her cheeks in her <lb/>
            sorrow, and his house is only half complete without him," 1 <lb/>
            while he is dragged about, and wanders about, and wastes <lb/>
            his time in idle hopes, and has to put up with much insult. <lb/>
            And even if he gets any of those things he desires, giddy <lb/>
            and dizzy at Fortune's rope-dance, he seeks retirement, and <lb/>
            deems those happy who live obscure and in security, while <lb/>
            they again look up admiringly at him who soars so high <lb/>
            above their heads.2</p>
          <p>§ II. Vice has universally an ill effect on everybody, being <lb/>
            in itself a sufficient producer of infelicity, needing no in­ <lb/>
            struments nor ministers. For tyrants, anxious to make <lb/>
            those whom they punish wretched, keep executioners and <lb/>
            torturers, and contrive branding-irons and other instru­ <lb/>
            ments of torture to inspire fear3 in the brute soul, whereas <lb/>
            vice attacks the soul without any such apparatus, and <lb/>
            crushes and dejects it, and fills a man with sorrow, and <lb/>
            lamentation, and melancholy, and remorse. Here is a <lb/>
            proof of what I say. Many are silent under mutilation, and <lb/>
            endure scourging or torture at the hand of despots or <lb/>
            tyrants without uttering a word, whenever their soul, <lb/>
            abating the pain by reason, forcibly as it were checks and <lb/>
            represses them : but you can never quiet anger or smother <lb/>
            grief, or persuade a timid person not to run away, or one <lb/>
            suffering from remorse not to cry out, nor tear his hair, <lb/>
            nor smite his thigh. Thus vice is stronger than fire and <lb/>
            sword.</p>
          <p>§ III. You know of course that cities, when they desire <lb/>
            to publicly contract for the building of temples or <lb/>
            colossuses, listen to the estimates of the contractors who <lb/>
            compete for the job, and bring their plans and charges, and <lb/>
            finally select the contractor who will do the work at least <note type="footnote"> 1 “Iliad,” ii. 700, 701. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 'Tis ever so. Compare Horrce, " Sat.” i. i. 1-14. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Adopting Reiske's readii g. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="140"/>
            expense, and best, and quickest. Let as suppose then that <lb/>
            we publicly contract to make the life of man miserable, <lb/>
            and take the estimates of Fortune and Vice for this object. <lb/>
            Fortune shall come forward, provided with all sorts of in­ <lb/>
            struments and costly apparatus to make life miserable and <lb/>
            wretched. She shall come with robberies and wars, and <lb/>
            the blood-guiltiness of tyrants, and storms at sea, and <lb/>
            lightning drawn down from the sky, she shall compound <lb/>
            hemlock, she shall bring swords, she shall levy an army <lb/>
            of informers, she shall cause fevers to break out, she shall <lb/>
            rattle fetters and build prisons. It is true that most of <lb/>
            these things are owing to Vice rather than Fortune, but let <lb/>
            us suppose them all to come from Fortune. And let Vice <lb/>
            stand by naked, without any external things against man, <lb/>
            and let her ask Fortune how she will make man un­ <lb/>
            happy and dejected. Fortune, dost thou threaten poverty? <lb/>
            Metrocles laughs at thee, who sleeps during winter among <lb/>
            the sheep, in summer in the vestibules of temples, and <lb/>
            challenges the king of the Persians,1 who winters at <lb/>
            Babylon, and summers in Media, to vie with him in hap­ <lb/>
            piness. Dost thou bring slavery, and bondage, and sale ? <lb/>
            Diogenes despises thee, who cried out, as he was being <lb/>
            sold by some robbers, " Who will buy a master ? " Dost <lb/>
            thou mix a cup of poison ? Didst not thou offer such <lb/>
            a one to Socrates ? And cheerfully, and mildly, without <lb/>
            fear, without changing colour or countenance, he calmly <lb/>
            drank it up : and when he was dead, all who survived <lb/>
            deemed him happy, as sure to have a divine lot in Hades. <lb/>
            And as to thy fire, did not Decius, the general of the <lb/>
            Romans, anticipate it for himself, having piled up a funeral <lb/>
            pyre between the two armies, and sacrificed himself to <lb/>
            Cronos, dedicating himself for the supremacy of his <lb/>
            country ? And the chaste and loving wives of the Indians <lb/>
            strive and contend with one another for the fire, and she <lb/>
            that wins the day and gets burnt with the body of her <lb/>
            husband, is pronounced happy by the rest, and her praises <lb/>
            sung. And of the wise men in that part of the world no <lb/>
            one is esteemed or pronounced happy, who does not in his <note type="footnote"> 1 Proverbial for extreme good fortune. Cf. Horace, “ Odes," iii. <lb/>

            lifetime, in good health and in full possession of all his <lb/>
            faculties, separate soul from body by fire, and emerge pure <lb/>
            from flesh, having purged away his mortal part. Or wilt <lb/>
            thou reduce a man from a splendid property, and house, <lb/>
            and table, and sumptuous living, to a threadbare coat and <lb/>
            wallet, and begging of daily bread ? Such was the beginning <lb/>
            of happiness to Diogenes, of freedom and glory to Crates. <lb/>
            Or wilt thou nail a man on a cross, or impale him on a stake ? <lb/>
            What cares Theodorus whether he rots above ground or <lb/>
            below ? Such was the happy mode of burial amongst the <lb/>
            Scythians,l and among the Hyrcanians dogs, among the <lb/>
            Bactrians birds, devour according to the laws the dead <lb/>
            bodies of those who have made a happy end.</p>
          <p>§ iv. Who then are made unhappy by these things ? <lb/>
            Those who have no manliness or reason, the enervated and <lb/>
            untrained, who retain the opinions they had as children. <lb/>
            Fortune therefore does not produce perfect infelicity, un­ <lb/>
            less Vice co-operate. For as a thread saws through a bone <lb/>
            that has been soaked in ashes and vinegar, and as people bend <lb/>
            and fashion ivory only when it has been made soft and <lb/>
            supple by beer, and cannot under any other circumstances, <lb/>
            so Fortune, lighting upon what is in itself faulty and soft <lb/>
            through Vice, hollows it out and wounds it. And as the <lb/>
            Parthian juice, though hurtful to no one else nor injurious <lb/>
            to those who touch it or carry it about, yet if it be com­ <lb/>
            municated to a wounded man straightway kills him through <lb/>
            his previous susceptibility to receive its essence, so he who <lb/>
            will be upset in soul by Fortune must have some secret <lb/>
            internal ulcer or sore to make external things so piteous <lb/>
            and lamentable.</p>
          <p>§ v. Does then Vice need Fortune to bring about in­ <lb/>
            felicity ? By no means. She lashes not up the rough and <lb/>
            stormy sea, she girds not lonely mountain passes with <lb/>
            robbers lying in wait by the way, she makes not clouds of <lb/>
            hail to burst on the fruitful plains, she suborns not Meletus <lb/>
            or Anytus or Callixenus as accusers, she takes not away <lb/>
            wealth, excludes not people from the prætorship to make <lb/>
            them wretched; but she scares the rich, the well-to-do, <lb/>
            and great heirs; by land and sea she insinuates herself and <note type="footnote"> 1 See Herodotus, iv. 72. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="142"/>
            sticks to people, infusing lust, inflaming with anger, <lb/>
            afflicting them with superstitious fears, tearing them in <lb/>
            pieces with envy.</p>

          <p>§ I. Homer, looking at the mortality of all living <lb/>
            creatures, and comparing them with one another in their <lb/>
            lives and habits, gave vent to his thoughts in the words, <lb/>
            “ Of all the things that on the earth do breathe, <lb/>
            Or creep, man is by far the wretehedest;” 1 <lb/>
            assigning to man an unhappy pre-eminence in extreme mis­ <lb/>
            fortune. But let us, assuming that man is, as thus publicly <lb/>
            declared, supreme in infelicity and the most wretched of all <lb/>
            living creatures, compare him with himself, in the estimate <lb/>
            of his misery dividing body and soul, not idly but in a very <lb/>
            necessary way, that we may learn whether our life is more <lb/>
            wretched owing to Fortune or through our own fault. For <lb/>
            disease is engendered in the body by nature, but vice and <lb/>
            depravity in the soul is first its own doing, then its settled <lb/>
            condition. And it is no slight aid to tranquillity of <lb/>
            mind if what is bad be capable of cure, and lighter and less <lb/>
            violent.</p>
          <p>§ II. The fox in Æsop2 disputing with the leopard as to <lb/>
            their respective claims to variety, the latter showed its body <lb/>
            and appearance all bright and spotted, while the tawny <lb/>
            skin of the former was dirty and not pleasant to look at. <lb/>
            Then the fox said, " Look inside me, sir judge, and you will <lb/>
            see that I am more full of variety than my opponent," re­ <lb/>

            varied and susceptible storehouse and treasury of what is <lb/>
            bad, not flowing in from without, but having as it were <lb/>
            innate and native springs, which vice, being exceedingly <lb/>
            rich and abundant in passion, produces. And if diseases <lb/>
            are detected in the body by the pulse and by pallors and <lb/>
            flushes,1 and are indicated by heats and sudden pains, while <lb/>
            the diseases of the mind, bad as they are, escape the notice <lb/>
            of most people, the latter are worse because they deprive <lb/>
            the sufferer of the perception of them. For reason if it be <lb/>
            sound perceives the diseases of the body, but he that is <lb/>
            diseased in his mind cannot judge of his sufferings, for he <lb/>
            suffers in the very seat of judgement. We ought to account <lb/>
            therefore the first and greatest of the diseases of the mind <lb/>
            that ignorance,2 whereby vice is incurable for most people, <lb/>
            dwelling with them and living and dying with them. For <lb/>
            the beginning of getting rid of disease is the perception of <lb/>
            it, which leads the sufferer to the necessary relief, but he <lb/>

            epilepsies, apoplexies, and those fevers which raise inflam­ <lb/>

            gout swift-footedness, or paleness a good colour; but many <lb/>

            tition, and cowardice prudence. Then again those that are <lb/>
            ill in body send for doctors, for they are conscious of what <lb/>
            they need to counteract their ailments; but those who are <lb/>
            ill in mind avoid philosophers, for they think themselves <lb/>
            excellent in the very matters in which they come short. <lb/>
            And it is on this account that we maintain that ophthalmia <lb/>
            is a lesser evil than madness, and gout than frenzy. For <lb/>
            the person ill in body is aware of it and calls loudly for the <lb/>
            doctor, and when he comes allows him to anoint his eye, <lb/>
            to open a vein, or to plaster up his head ; but you hear mad <lb/>
            Agave in her frenzy not knowing her dearest ones, but <lb/>
            crying out, " We bring from the mountain to the halls a <lb/>
            young stag recently torn limb from limb, a fortunate cap­ <lb/>
            ture.”1 Again he who is ill in body straightway gives up <lb/>
            and goes to bed and remains there quietly till he is well, <lb/>
            and if he toss and tumble about a little when the fit is on <lb/>

            restrain him and check him. But those who suffer from a <lb/>
            diseased brain are then most active and least at rest, for <lb/>
            impulses bring about action, and the passions are vehement <lb/>
            impulses. And so they do not let the mind rest, but when <lb/>
            the man most requires quiet and silence and retirement, <lb/>
            then is he dragged into the open air, and becomes the victim <lb/>
            of anger, contentiousness, lust, and grief, and is compelled <lb/>

            not let one sail, so those storms of the soul are more for­ <lb/>

            his reason when it is disturbed, but without a pilot and <lb/>
            without ballast, in perplexity and uncertainty through <lb/>
            contrary and confusing courses, he rushes headlong and <lb/>
            falls into woeful shipwreck, and shatters his life. So that <note type="footnote"> I Euripides, “Bacchæ,” 1170-1172. Agave's treatment of her son <lb/>

            from these points of view it is worse to be diseased in mind <lb/>
            than body, for the latter only suffer, but the former do in <lb/>
            as well as suffer ill. But why need I speak of our various <lb/>
            passions ? The very times bring them to our mind. Do <lb/>

            one another and surging round the rostrum and forum ? <lb/>
            They have not assembled here to sacrifice to their country's <lb/>
            gods, nor to share in one another's rites; they are not <lb/>
            bringing to Ascræan Zeus the firstfruits of Lydian pro­ <lb/>

            but a mighty plague stirring up Asia in annual cycles <lb/>
            drives them here for litigation and suits at law at stated <lb/>
            times: and the mass of business, like the confluence of <lb/>
            mighty rivers, has inundated one forum, and festers and <lb/>

            amiss that the man named many because he knew not one. <lb/>
            Might not someone jeer at us in the same way, as being <lb/>
            afraid, when we have not yet one firm friendship, that we <lb/>
            shall without knowing it fall upon an abundance of friends ? <lb/>
            It is very much the same as if a. man maimed and blind <lb/>
            should be afraid of becoming hundred-handed like Briareus <lb/>
            or all eyes like Argus. And yet we wonderfully praise the <lb/>
            young man in Menander, who said that he thought anyone <lb/>
            wonderfully good, if he had even the shadow of a friend.2</p>
          <p>§ II. But among many other things what stands chiefly <lb/>
            in the way of getting a friend is the desire for many friends, <lb/>
            like a licentious woman who, through giving her favours <lb/>
            indiscriminately, cannot retain her old lovers, who are <lb/>
            neglected and drop off ; 3 or rather like the foster-child of <lb/>
            Hypsipyle, " sitting in the meadow and plucking flower <lb/>
            after flower, snatching at each prize with gladsome heart, <lb/>
            insatiable in its childish delight,” 4 so in the case of each of <lb/>
            us, owing to our love of novelty and fickleness, the recent <lb/>
            flower ever attracts, and makes us inconstant, frequently <lb/>
            laying the foundations of many friendships and intimacies <lb/>
            that come to nothing, neglecting in love of what we <lb/>
            eagerly pursue what we have already possession of. To <lb/>
            begin therefore with the domestic hearth,5 as the saying <lb/>
            is, with the traditions of life that time has handed down to us <lb/>
            about constant friends, let us take the witness and counsel <lb/>
            of antiquity, according to which friendships go in pairs, as <lb/>
            in the cases of Theseus and Pirithous, Achilles andPatroclus, <lb/>
            Orestes and Pylades, Phintias and Damon, Epaminondas <lb/>
            and Pelopidas. For friendship is a creature that goes in <lb/>
            pairs, and is not gregarious, or crow-like,6 and to think a <note type="footnote"> 1 Plato, "Men." p. 71 E. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Quoted more fully by our author, “ De Fraterno Amere," § iii. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 “ Eadem comparatione utitur Lucianus in Toxari T. ii. p. 351 : <lb/>

            friend a second self, and to call him companion as it were <lb/>
            second one,l shows that friendship is a dual relation. For <lb/>
            we can get neither many slaves nor many friends at small <lb/>
            expense. What then is the purchase-money of friendship ? <lb/>
            Benevolence and complaisance conjoined with virtue, and <lb/>
            yet nature has nothing more rare than these. And so to <lb/>
            love or be loved very much cannot find place with many <lb/>
            persons; for as rivers that have many channels and <lb/>
            cuttings have a weak and thin stream, so excessive love in <lb/>
            the soul if divided out among many is weakened. Thus <lb/>
            love for their young is most strongly implanted in those <lb/>
            that bear only one, as Homer calls a beloved son " the only <lb/>
            one, the child of old age,” 2 that is, when the parents <lb/>
            neither have nor are likely to have another child.</p>
          <p>§ III. Not that we insist on only one friend, but among <lb/>
            the rest there should be one eminently so, like a child of <lb/>
            old age, who according to that well-known proverb <lb/>
            has eaten a bushel of salt with one,3 not as nowadays <lb/>
            many so-called friends contract friendship from drinking <lb/>
            together once, or playing at ball together, or playing to­ <lb/>
            gether with dice, or passing the night together at some inn, <lb/>
            or meeting at the wrestling-school or in the market. And <lb/>
            in the houses of rich and leading men people congratulate <lb/>
            them on their many friends, when they see the large and <lb/>
            bustling crowd of visitors and handshakers and retainers : <lb/>
            and yet they see more flies in their kitchens, and as the <lb/>
            flies only come for the dainties, so they only dance atten­ <lb/>
            dance for what they can get. And since true friendship has <lb/>
            three main requirements, virtue, as a thing good ; and fami­ <lb/>
            liarity, as a thing pleasant; and use, as a thing serviceable; <lb/>
            for we ought to choose a friend with judgement, and rejoice <lb/>
            in his company, and make use of him in need ; and all <lb/>
            these things are prejudicial to abundance of friends, espe­ <lb/>
            cially judgement, which is the most important point; we <lb/>
            must first consider, if it is impossible in a short time to test <lb/>
            dancers who are to form a chorus, or rowers who are to <lb/>
            pull together, or slaves who are to act as stewards of estates, <note type="footnote"> 1 The paronomasia is on <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐται̃ρος, ἔπερος</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 " Iliad,” ix. 482; " Odyssey,” xvi. 19. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Cf.

            or as tutors of one's sons, far more difficult is it to meet <lb/>
            with many friends who will take off their coats to aid you in <lb/>
            every fortune, each of whom " offers his services to you in <lb/>
            prosperity, and does not object to share your adversity." <lb/>
            For neither does a ship encounter so many storms at sea, <lb/>
            nor do they fortify places with walls, or harbours with <lb/>
            defences and earthworks, in the expectation of so many <lb/>
            and great dangers, as friendship tested well and soundly <lb/>
            promises defence and refuge from. But if friends slip in <lb/>
            without being tested, like money proved to be bad, <lb/>
            “ Those who shall lose such friends may well be glad, <lb/>
            And those who have such pray that they may lose them.”1 <lb/>
            Yet is it difficult and by no means easy to avoid and bring <lb/>
            to a close an unpleasant friendship : as in the case of food <lb/>
            which is injurious and harmful, we cannot retain it on the <lb/>
            stomach without damage and hurt, nor can we expel it as <lb/>
            it was taken into the mouth, but only in a putrid mixed <lb/>
            up and changed form, so a bad friend is troublesome both <lb/>
            to others and himself if retained, and if he be got rid of <lb/>
            forcibly it is with hostility and hatred, and like the voiding <lb/>
            of bile.</p>
          <p>§ iv. We ought not, therefore, lightly to welcome or <lb/>
            strike up an intimate friendship with any chance comers, <lb/>
            or love those who attach themselves to us, but attach our. <lb/>
            selves to those who are worthy of our friendship. For <lb/>
            what is easily got is not always desirable: and we pass <lb/>
            over and trample upon heather and brambles that stick to <lb/>
            us2 on our road to the olive and vine: so also is it good <lb/>
            not always to make a friend of the person who is expert in <lb/>
            twining himself around us, but after testing them to attach <lb/>
            ourselves to those who are worthy of our affection and <lb/>
            likely to be serviceable to us.</p>
          <p>§ v. As therefore Zeuxis, when some people accused <lb/>
            him of painting slowly, replied, " I admit that I do, but <lb/>
            then I paint to last," so ought we to test for a long time <lb/>
            the friendship and intimacy that we take up and mean to <note type="footnote"> 1 Sophocles, Fragm. 741. Quoted again by our author, " On Love," <lb/>

            I shall stick." </note> <lb/>

            keep. Is it not easy then to put to the test many friends, <lb/>
            and to associate with many friends at the same time, or is <lb/>
            this impossible P For intimacy is the full enjoyment of <lb/>
            friendship, and most pleasant is companying with and <lb/>
            spending the day with a friend. " Never again shall we <lb/>
            alive, apart from dear friends, sit and take counsel alone <lb/>
            together.”1 And Menelaus said about Odysseus, "Nor <lb/>
            did anything ever divide or separate us, who loved and <lb/>
            delighted in one another, till death's black cloud over­ <lb/>
            shadowed us."2 The contrary effect seems to be produced by <lb/>
            abundance of friends. For the friendship of a pair of friends <lb/>
            draws them together and puts them together and holds <lb/>
            them together, and is heightened by intercourse and kindli­ <lb/>
            ness, " as when the juice of the fig curdles and binds the <lb/>
            white milk,"3 as Empedocles says, such unity and com­ <lb/>
            plete union will such a friendship produce. Whereas <lb/>
            having many friends puts people apart and severs and dis­ <lb/>
            unites them, by transferring and shifting the tie of friend­ <lb/>
            ship too frequently, and does not admit of a mixture and <lb/>
            welding of goodwill by the diffusing and compacting of <lb/>
            intimacy. And this causes at once an inequality and diffi­ <lb/>
            culty in respect of acts of kindness, for the uses of friend­ <lb/>
            ship become inoperative by being dispersed over too wide <lb/>
            an area. "One man is acted upon by his character, another <lb/>
            by his reflection." 4 For neither do our natures and impulses <lb/>
            always incline in the same directions, nor are our fortunes <lb/>
            in life identical, for opportunities of action are, like the <lb/>
            winds, favourable to some, unfavourable to others.</p>
          <p>§ vi. Moreover, if all our friends want to do the same <lb/>
            things at the same time, it will be difficult to satisfy them <lb/>
            all, whether they desire to deliberate, or to act in state <lb/>
            affairs, or wish for office, or are going to entertain guests. <lb/>
            If again at the same time they chance to be engaged in <lb/>
            different occupations and interests and ask you all together, <lb/>
            one who is going on a voyage that you will sail with him, <lb/>
            another who is going to law that you will be his advocate, <lb/>
            another who is going to try a case that you will try it with <lb/>

            Resounds with triumph-songs and bitter wailing,”1 <lb/>
            that is the fruit of many friends ; to oblige all is impossible, <lb/>
            to oblige none is absurd, and to help one and offend many <lb/>
            is grievous. <lb/>
            “ No lover ever yet fancied neglect." 2 <lb/>
            And yet people bear patiently and without anger the care­ <lb/>
            lessness and neglect of friends, if they get from them such <lb/>
            excuses as " I forgot," " I did it unwittingly." But he <lb/>
            who says, " I did not assist you in your lawsuit, for I was <lb/>
            assisting another friend," or " I did not visit you when you <lb/>
            had your fever, for I was helping so-and-so who was <lb/>
            entertaining his friends," excusing himself for his inatten­ <lb/>
            tion to one by his attention to another, so far from making <lb/>
            the offence less, even adds jealousy to his neglect. But <lb/>
            most people in friendship regard only, it seems, what can <lb/>
            be got out of it, overlooking what will be asked in return, <lb/>
            and not remembering that he, who has had many of his <lb/>
            own requests granted, must oblige others in turn by grant­ <lb/>
            ing their requests. And as Briareus with his hundred <lb/>
            hands had to feed fifty stomachs, and was therefore no better <lb/>
            provided than we are, who with two hands have to supply <lb/>
            the necessities of only one belly, so in having many friends3 <lb/>
            one has to do many services for them, one has to share in <lb/>
            their anxiety, and to toil and moil with them. For we <lb/>
            must not listen to Euripides when he says, " mortals ought <lb/>
            to join in moderate friendships for one another, and not <lb/>
            love with all their heart, that the spell may be soon broken, <lb/>
            and the friendship may either be ended or become closer <lb/>
            at will,” 4 that so it may be adjusted to our requirements, <lb/>
            like the sail of a ship that we can either slacken or haul <note type="footnote"> 1 Sophocles, a CEdipus Tyrannus," 4, 5. Quoted again “On Moral <lb/>

            tight. But let us transfer, Euripides, these lines of yours <lb/>
            to enmities, and bid people make their animosities moderate, <lb/>
            and not hate with all their heart, that their hatred, and <lb/>
            wrath, and querulousness, and suspicions, may be easily <lb/>
            broken. Recommend rather for our consideration that <lb/>
            paying of Pythagoras, " Do not give many your right <lb/>
            hand,” 1 that is, do not make many friends, do not go in for <lb/>
            a common and vulgar friendship, which is sure to cause <lb/>
            anyone much trouble; for its sharing in others' anxieties <lb/>
            and griefs and labours and dangers is quite intolerable <lb/>
            to free and noble natures. And that was a true saying of <lb/>
            the wise Chilo2 to one who told him he had no enemy, <lb/>
            " Neither," said he, " do you seem to me to have a friend." <lb/>
            For enmities inevitably accompany and are involved in <lb/>
            friendships.</p>
          <p>§ VII. It is impossible I say not to share with a friend in <lb/>
            his injuries and disgraces and enmities, for enemies at once <lb/>
            suspect and hate the friend of their enemies, and even <lb/>
            friends are often envious and jealous and carp at him. As <lb/>
            then the oracle given to Timesias about his colony foretold <lb/>
            him, " that his swarm of bees would soon be followed by a; <lb/>
            swarm of wasps," so those that seek a swarm of friends <lb/>
            have sometimes lighted unawares on a wasp's-nest of <lb/>
            enemies. And the remembrance of wrongs done by an <lb/>
            enemy and the kindness of a friend do not weigh in the <lb/>
            same balance. See how Alexander treated the friends and <lb/>
            intimates of Philotas and Parmenio, how Dionysius treated <lb/>
            those of Dion, Nero those of Plautus, Tiberius those of, <lb/>
            Sejanus, torturing and putting them to death. For as <lb/>
            neither the gold nor rich robes of Creon's daughter3 <lb/>
            availed her or her sire, but the flame that burst out <lb/>
            suddenly involved him in the same fate as herself, as he <lb/>
            ran up to embrace her and rescue her, so some friends, <lb/>
            though they have had no enjoyment out of their friends' <lb/>
            prosperity, are involved in their misfortunes. And this is <lb/>
            especially the case with philosophers and kind people, as <lb/>
            Theseus, when his friend Pirithous was punished and im- <note type="footnote"> 1 Compare " On Education," § xvii. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Chilo was one of the Seven Wise Men. See Pausanias, iii. 16; <lb/>

            prisoned, “ was also bound in fetters not of brass.” 1 And <lb/>
            Thucydides tells us that during the plague at Athens <lb/>
            those that most displayed their virtue perished with their <lb/>
            friends that were ill, for they neglected their own lives in <lb/>
            going to visit them.2</p>
          <p>§ VIII. We ought not therefore to be too lavish with our <lb/>
            virtue, binding it together and implicating it in various <lb/>
            people's fortunes, but we ought to preserve our friendship <lb/>
            for those who are worthy of it, and are capable of recipro­ <lb/>
            eating it. For this is indeed the greatest argument against <lb/>
            many friends that friendship is originated by similarity. <lb/>
            For seeing that even the brutes can hardly be forced to <lb/>
            mix with those that are unlike themselves, but crouch <lb/>
            down, and show their dislike, and run away, while they mix <lb/>
            freely with those that are akin to them and have a similar <lb/>
            nature, and gently and gladly make friends with one another <lb/>
            then, how is it possible that there should be friendship be­ <lb/>
            tween people differing in characters and temperaments and <lb/>
            ideas of life ? For harmony on the harp or lyre is attained by <lb/>
            notes in unison and not in unison, sharp and flat somehow <lb/>
            or other producing concord, but in the harmony of friend­ <lb/>
            ship there must be no unlike, or uneven, or unequal element, <lb/>
            but from all alike must come agreement in opinions and <lb/>
            wishes and feeling, as if one soul were put into several bodies.</p>
          <p>§ IX. What man then is so industrious, so changeable, <lb/>
            and so versatile, as to be able to make himself like and <lb/>
            'adapt himself to many different persons, and not to laugh <lb/>
            at the advice of Theognis, " Imitate the ingenuity of the <lb/>
            polypus, that takes the colour of whatever stone it sticks <lb/>
            to." 3 And yet the changes in the polypus do not go deep <lb/>
            but are only on the surface, which from its thickness or <lb/>
            thinness takes the impression of everything that approaches <lb/>
            it, whereas friends endeavour to be like one another in <lb/>
            character, and feeling, and language, and pursuits, and <lb/>
            disposition. It requires a not very fortunate or very good <lb/>

            frequently at the same time a student with the learned, and <lb/>
            ready to try a fall with wrestlers, or to go a hunting with <lb/>
            people fond of the chase, or to get drunk with tipplers, or to <lb/>
            go a canvassing with politicians, having no fixed character <lb/>
            of his own.' And as the natural philosophers say of un­ <lb/>
            formed and colourless matter when subjected to external <lb/>
            change, that it is now fire, now water, now air, now solid <lb/>
            earth, so the soul suitable for many friendships must be <lb/>
            impressionable, and versatile, and pliant, and changeable. <lb/>
            But friendship requires a steady constant and unchange­ <lb/>
            able character, a person that is uniform in his intimacy. <lb/>
            And so a constant friend is a thing rare and hard to find.</p>

            <title type="sub">HOW ONE MAY DISCERN A FLATTERER FROM A FRIEND.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>§ I. Plato says,2 Antiochus Philopappus, that all men <lb/>
            pardon the man who acknowledges that he is excessively fond <lb/>
            of himself, but that there is among many other defects this <lb/>
            very grave one in self-love, that by it a man becomes incapable <lb/>
            of being a just and impartial judge about himself, for love is <lb/>
            blind in regard to the loved object, unless a person has learnt <lb/>
            and accustomed himself to honour and pursue what is <lb/>
            noble rather than his own selfish interests. This gives a <lb/>
            great field for the flatterer in friendship, who finds a wonder­ <lb/>
            ful base of operations in our self-love, which makes each <lb/>
            person his own first and greatest flatterer, and easily <lb/>
            admits a flatterer from without, who will be, so he thinks <lb/>
            and hopes, both a witness and confirmer of his good opinion <lb/>
            of himself. For he that lies open to the reproach of being <lb/>
            fond of flatterers is very fond of himself, and owing to his <note type="footnote"> “ Met." it 9 ; “ Fasti," i. 367 sq., and especially Horace, “ Epistles," <lb/>

            goodwill to himself wishes to possess all good qualities, <lb/>
            and thinks he actually does; the wish is not ridiculous, <lb/>
            but the thought is misleading and requires a good deal of <lb/>
            caution. And if truth is a divine thing, and, according to <lb/>
            Plato,1 the beginning of all good things both to the gods <lb/>
            and men, the flatterer is likely to be an enemy to the gods, <lb/>
            and especially to Apollo, for he always sets himself against <lb/>
            that famous saying, "Know thyself,"2 implanting in every­ <lb/>
            .body's mind self-deceit and ignorance of his own good or <lb/>
            bad qualities, thus making his good points defective and <lb/>
            imperfect, and his bad points altogether incorrigible.</p>
          <p>§ II. If however, as is the case with most other bad <lb/>
            things, the flatterer attacked only or chiefly ignoble or <lb/>
            worthless persons, the evil would not be so mischievous or <lb/>
            so difficult to guard against. But since, as wood-worms <lb/>
            breed most in soft and sweet wood, those whose charac­ <lb/>
            ters are honourable and good and equitable encourage and <lb/>
            support the flatterer most,-and moreover, as Simonides <lb/>
            says, "rearing of horses does not go with the oil-flask,3 but <lb/>
            with fruitful fields,” so we see that flattery does not join <lb/>
            itself to the poor, the obscure, or those without means, but <lb/>
            is the snare and bane of great houses and estates, and often <lb/>
            overturns kingdoms and principalities,-it is a matter of no <lb/>
            small importance, needing much foresight, to examine the <lb/>
            question, that so flattery may be easily detected, and neither <lb/>
            injure nor discredit friendship. For just as lice leave <lb/>
            dying persons, and abandon bodies when the blood on <lb/>
            which they feed is drying up, so one never yet saw flatterers <lb/>
            dancing attendance on dry and cold poverty, but they <lb/>
            fasten on wealth and position and there get fat, but speedily <lb/>
            decamp if reverses come. But we ought not to wait to <lb/>
            experience that, which would be unprofitable, or rather <lb/>
            injurious and dangerous. For not to find friends at a time <lb/>
            when you want them is hard, as also not to be able to exchange <lb/>
            an inconstant and bad friend for a constant and good one. <lb/>
            For a friend should be like money tried before being re- <note type="footnote"> I “Laws,” v. p. 730 C. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Inscribed in the vestibule of the temple of Apollo at Delphi. See <lb/>

            quired, not found faulty in our need. For we ought not <lb/>
            to have our wits about us only when the mischief is done, <lb/>
            but we ought to try and prevent the flatterer doing any harm <lb/>
            to us : for otherwise we shall be in the same plight as people <lb/>
            who test deadly poisons by first tasting them, and kill or <lb/>
            nearly kill themselves in the experiment. We do not <lb/>
            praise such, nor again all those who, looking at their friend <lb/>
            simply from the point of view of decorum and utility, <lb/>
            think that they can detect all agreeable and pleasant com­ <lb/>
            panions as flatterers in the very act. For a friend ought <lb/>
            not to be disagreeable or unpleasant, nor ought friendship <lb/>
            to be a thing high and mighty with sourness and austerity, <lb/>
            but even its decorous deportment ought to be attractive <lb/>
            and winning,1 for by it 3 <lb/>
            " The Graces and Desire have pitched their tents,”2 <lb/>
            and not only to a person in misfortune " is it sweet to look <lb/>
            into the eyes of a friendly persona as Euripides 3 says, but <lb/>
            no less does it bring pleasure and charm in good fortune, <lb/>
            than when it relieves the sorrows and difficulties of adver­ <lb/>
            sity. And as Evenus said " fire was the best sance,” 4, so the <lb/>
            deity, mixing up friendship with life, has made everything <lb/>
            bright and sweet and acceptable by its presence and the <lb/>
            enjoyment it brings. How else indeed could the flatterer in­ <lb/>
            sinuate himself by the pleasure he gives, unless he knew <lb/>
            that friendship admitted the pleasurable element ? It <lb/>
            would be impossible to say. But just as spurious and <lb/>
            mock gold only imitates the brightness and glitter of real <lb/>
            gold, so the flatterer seems to imitate the pleasantness and <lb/>
            agreeableness of the real friend, and to exhibit himself <lb/>
            ever merry and bright, contradicting and opposing nothing. <lb/>
            We must not however on that account suspect all who <note type="footnote"> 1 Wyttenbach well compares Cicero, " De Amicitia," xviii. : "Accedat <lb/>

            habet ilia quidem gravitatem: sed amicitia remissior esse debet, et <lb/>

            and “Platonicæ Quæstiones,” x. § iii. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="156"/>
            praise as simple flatterers. For friendship requires praise <lb/>
            as much as censure on the proper occasion. Indeed <lb/>
            peevishness and querulousness are altogether alien to friend­ <lb/>
            ship and social life: but when goodwill bestows praise <lb/>
            ungrudgingly and readily upon good actions, people endure <lb/>
            also easily and without pain admonition and plainspeaking, <lb/>
            believing and continuing to love the person who took such <lb/>
            pleasure in praising, as if now he only blamed out of neces­ <lb/>
            sity.</p>
          <p>§ in. It is difficult then, someone may say, to distinguish <lb/>
            between the flatterer and the friend, if they differ neither <lb/>
            in the pleasure they give nor in the praise they bestow ; <lb/>
            for as to services and attentions you may often see friend­ <lb/>
            ship outstripped by flattery. Certainly it is so, I should <lb/>
            reply, if we are trying to find the genuine flatterer who <lb/>
            handles his craft with cleverness and art, but not if, like <lb/>
            most people, we consider those persons flatterers who are <lb/>
            called their own oil-flask-carriers and table-men, men who <lb/>
            begin to talk, as one said, the moment their hands have <lb/>
            been washed for dinner,1 whose servility, ribaldry, and want <lb/>
            of all decency, is apparent at the first dish and glass. It <lb/>
            did not of course require very much discrimination to <lb/>
            detect Melanthius the parasite of Alexander of Pheræ of <lb/>
            flattery, who, to those who asked how Alexander was mur­ <lb/>
            dered, answered, " Through his side into my belly ": or <lb/>
            those who formed a circle round a wealthy table, " whom <lb/>
            neither fire, nor sword, nor steel, would keep from running <lb/>
            to a feast" :2 or those female flatterers in Cyprus, who after <lb/>
            they crossed over into Syria were nicknamed " step- <lb/>
            ladders,”3 because they lay down and let the kings' wives <lb/>
            use their bodies as steps to mount their carriages.</p>
          <p>§ iv. What kind of flatterer then must we be on our <lb/>
            guard against ? The one who neither seems to be nor <lb/>
            acknowledges himself to be one: whom you will not always <lb/>
            find in the vicinity of your kitchen, who is not to be <note type="footnote"> 1 As was usual. See Homer, "Odyssey," i. 146. Cf. Plautus, <lb/>

            caught watching the dial to see how near it is to dinner­ <lb/>
            time,1 nor gets so drunk as to throw himself down anyhow, <lb/>
            but one who is generally sober, and a busybody, and thinks <lb/>
            he ought to have a hand in your affairs, and wishes to <lb/>
            share in your secrets, and as to friendship plays rather a <lb/>
            tragic than a satyric or comic part. For as Plato says, <lb/>
            " it is the height of injustice to appear to be just when you <lb/>
            are not really so,"2 so we must deem the most dangerous <lb/>
            kind of flattery not the open but the secret, not the playful <lb/>
            but the serious. For it throws suspicion even upon a <lb/>
            genuine friendship, which we may often confound with it, <lb/>
            if we are not careful. When Gobryas pursued one of the <lb/>
            Magi into a dark room, and was on the ground wrestling <lb/>
            with him, and Darius came up and was doubtful how he <lb/>
            could kill one without killing both, Gobryas bade him <lb/>
            thrust his sword boldly through both of them;3 but we, <lb/>
            since we give no assent to that saying, " Let friend perish <lb/>
            so the enemy perish with him," 4 in our endeavour to dis­ <lb/>
            tinguish the flatterer from the friend, seeing that their <lb/>
            resemblances are so many, ought to take great care that <lb/>
            we do not reject the good with the bad, nor in sparing <lb/>
            what is beneficial fall in with what is injurious. For as <lb/>
            wild grains mixed up with wheat, if very similar in size <lb/>
            and appearance, are not easily kept apart, for if the sieve <lb/>
            have small holes they don't pass through, and if large holes <lb/>
            they pass with the corn, so flattery is not easily distin. <lb/>
            guished from friendship, being mixed up with it in feeling <lb/>
            and emotion, habit and custom.</p>
          <p>§ v. Because however friendship is the most pleasant <lb/>
            of all things, and nothing more glads the heart of man, <lb/>
            therefore the flatterer attracts by the pleasure he gives, <lb/>
            pleasure being in fact his field. And because favours and <lb/>
            good services accompany friendship, as the proverb says <lb/>
            "a friend is more necessary than fire or water,”5 therefore <note type="footnote"> 1 “ Videatur Casaubonus ad Athenaeum, vi. p. 243 A.”—Wyttenbach. </note><note type="footnote">2 " Republic,” p. 361 A. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 See Herodotus, iii. 78. </note><note type="footnote">4 See Erasmus, " Adagia," p. 1883. </note><note type="footnote"> 5 " Proverbium etiam a Cicerone laudatum ‘ De Amicitia,' cap. vi. : <lb/>

             <pb n="158"/>
            the flatterer volunteers all sorts of services, and strives to <lb/>
            show himself on all occasions zealous and obliging and <lb/>
            ready. And since friendship is mainly produced by a simi­ <lb/>
            larity of tastes and habits, and to have the same likes and <lb/>
            dislikes first brings people together and unites them through <lb/>
            sympathy,l the flatterer observing this moulds himself like <lb/>
            material and demeans himself accordingly, seeking com­ <lb/>
            pletely to imitate and resemble those whom he desires to <lb/>
            ingratiate himself with, being supple in change, and plausible <lb/>
            in his imitations, so that one would say, <lb/>
            “Achilles’ son, 0 no, it is himself.”2 <lb/>
            But his cleverest trick is that, observing that freedom of speech <lb/>
            is both spoken of and reckoned as the peculiar and natural <lb/>
            voice of friendship, while not speaking freely is considered <lb/>
            unfriendly and disingenuous, he has not failed to imitate <lb/>
            this trait of friendship also. But just as clever cooks infuse <lb/>
            bitter sauces and sharp seasoning to prevent sweet things <lb/>
            from cloying, so these flatterers do not use a genuine or <lb/>
            serviceable freedom of speech, but merely a winking and <lb/>
            tickling innuendo. He is therefore difficult to detect, like <lb/>
            those creatures which naturally change their colour and <lb/>
            take that of the material or place near them.3 But since <lb/>
            he deceives and conceals his true character by his imitations, <lb/>
            it is our duty to unmask him and detect him by the diffe­ <lb/>
            rences between him and the true friend, and to show that <lb/>
            he is, as Plato says, "tricked out in other people's colours <lb/>
            and forms, from lack of any of his own.”4</p>
          <p>§ vi. Let us examine the matter then from the beginning. <lb/>
            I said that friendship originated in most cases from a similar <lb/>
            disposition and nature, generally inclined to the same <lb/>
            habits and morals, and rejoicing in the same pursuits, <lb/>
            studies, and amusements, as the following lines testify: <lb/>
            " To old man the voice of old man is sweetest, to boy that <lb/>
            of boy, to woman is most acceptable that of woman, to the <lb/>
            sick person that of sick person, while he that is overtaken <note type="footnote"> 1 Compare Sallust, "De Catilinæ Conjuratione," cap. xx.: "Nam <lb/>

             <pb n="159"/>
            by misfortune is a comforter to one in trouble." The <lb/>
            flatterer knowing then that it is innate in us to delight in, <lb/>
            and enjoy the company of, and to love, those who are <lb/>
            like ourselves, attempts first to approach and get near a <lb/>
            person in this direction, (as one tries to catch an animal in <lb/>
            the pastures,) by the same pursuits and amusements and <lb/>
            studies and modes of life quietly throwing out his bait, <lb/>
            and disguising himself in false colours, till his victim give <lb/>
            him an opportunity to catch him, and become tame and <lb/>
            tractable at his touch. Then too he censures the things <lb/>
            and modes of life and persons that he knows his victim <lb/>
            dislikes, while he praises those he fancies immoderately, <lb/>
            overdoing it indeed 1 with his show of surprise and exces­ <lb/>
            sive admiration, making him more and more convinced <lb/>
            that his likes and dislikes are the fruits of judgement and <lb/>
            not of caprice.</p>
          <p>§ VII. How then is the flatterer convicted, and by what <lb/>
            differences is he detected, of being only a counterfeit, and <lb/>
            not really like his victim ? We must first then look at the <lb/>
            even tenor and consistency of his principles, if he always <lb/>
            delights in the same things, and always praises the same <lb/>
            things, and directs and governs his life after one pattern, <lb/>
            as becomes the noble lover of consistent friendship and <lb/>
            familiarity. Such a person is a friend. But the flatterer <lb/>
            having no fixed character of his own,2 and not seeking to <lb/>
            lead the life suitable for him, but shaping and modelling <lb/>
            himself after another's pattern, is neither simple nor uni­ <lb/>
            form, but complex and unstable, assuming different appear­ <lb/>
            ances, like water poured from vessel to vessel, ever in a <lb/>
            state of flux and accommodating himself entirely to the <lb/>
            fashion of those who entertain him. The ape indeed, <lb/>
            as it seems, attempting to imitate man, is caught imitating <lb/>
            his movements and dancing like him, but the flatterer <lb/>
            himself attracts and decoys other men, imitating not all <lb/>
            alike, for with one he sings and dances, with another he <lb/>
            wrestles and gets covered with the dust of the palæstra, <note type="footnote"> 1 Wyttenbach compares Juvenal, iii. 100-108. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 See my note " On Abundance of Friends," § ix. Wyttenbach well <lb/>
            points out the felicity of the expression here, “siquidem parasitus est <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄοικος καὶ ἀνέστιος</foreign>.” </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="160"/>
            while he follows a third fond of hunting and the chase <lb/>
            all but shouting out the words of Phædra, <lb/>
            " How I desire to halloo on the dogs, <lb/>
            Chasing the dappled deer,"1 <lb/>
            and yet he has really no interest in the chase, it is the <lb/>
            hunter himself he sets the toils and snares for. And if the <lb/>
            object of his pursuit is some young scholar and lover of <lb/>
            learning, he is all for books then, his beard flows down to <lb/>
            his feet,! he's quite a sight with his threadbare cloak, has <lb/>
            all the indifference of the Stoic, and speaks of nothing but <lb/>
            the rectangles and triangles of Plato. But if any rich and <lb/>
            careless fellow fond of drink come in his way, <lb/>
            “Then wise Odysseus stript him of his rags,"* <lb/>
            his threadbare cloak is thrown aside, his beard is shorn off <lb/>
            like a fruitless crop, he goes in for wine-coolers and tankards, <lb/>
            and laughs loudly in the streets, and jeers at philosophers. <lb/>
            As they say happened at Syracuse, when Plato went there, <lb/>
            and Dionysius was seized with a furious passion for philo­ <lb/>
            sophy, and so great was the concourse of geometricians <lb/>
            that they raised up quite a cloud of dust in the palace, but <lb/>
            when Plato fell out of favour, and Dionysius gave up <lb/>
            philosophy, and went back again headlong to wine and <lb/>
            women and trifles and debauchery, then all the court was <lb/>
            metamorphosed, as if they all had drunk of Circe's cup, for <lb/>
            ignorance and oblivion and silliness reigned rampant. I <lb/>
            am borne out in what I say by the behaviour of great <lb/>
            flatterers and demagogues, the greatest of whom Alcibiades, <lb/>
            a jeerer and horse-rearer at Athens, and living a gay and <lb/>
            merry life, wore his hair closely shaven at Lacedæmon, and <lb/>
            washed in cold water, and attired himself in a threadbare <lb/>
            cloak; while in Thrace he fought5 and drank; and at <lb/>
            Tissaphernes' court lived delicately and luxuriously and <lb/>
            in a pretentious style; and thus curried favour and was <note type="footnote"> I Euripides," Hippolytus,” 219, 218. Cf. Ovid, "Heroides," iv. 41,42. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Compare “ How one may be aware of one's progress in virtue," <lb/>

             <pb n="161"/>
            popular with everybody by imitating their habits and ways. <lb/>
            Such was not the way however in which Epaminondas or <lb/>
            Agesilaus acted, for though they associated with very many <lb/>
            men and states and different modes of life, they maintained <lb/>
            everywhere their usual demeanour, both in dress and diet <lb/>
            and language and behaviour. So Plato1 at Syracnse was <lb/>
            exactly the same man as in the Academy, the same with <lb/>
            Dionysius as with Dion.</p>
          <p>§ VIII. As to the changes of the flatterer, which resemble <lb/>
            those of the polypus,2 a man may most easily detect them <lb/>
            by himself pretending to change about frequently, and by <lb/>
            censuring the kind of life he used formerly to praise, and <lb/>
            anon approving of the words actions and modes of life <lb/>
            that he used to be displeased with. He will then see that the <lb/>
            .flatterer is never consistent or himself, never loving hating <lb/>
            rejoicing grieving at his own initiative, but like a mirror, <lb/>
            merely reflecting the image of other people's emotions and <lb/>
            manners and feelings. Such a one will say, if you censure <lb/>
            one of your friends to him, "You are slow in finding the <lb/>
            fellow out, he never pleased me from the first." But if on <lb/>
            the other hand you change your language and praise him, <lb/>
            he will swear by Zeus that he rejoices at it, and is himself <lb/>
            under obligations to the man, and believes in him. And if <lb/>
            you talk of the necessity of changing your mode of life, of <lb/>
            retiring from public life to a life of privacy and ease, he <lb/>
            says, " We ought long ago to have got rid of uproar3 and <lb/>
            envy." But if you think of returning again to public <lb/>
            life, he chimes in, " Your sentiments do you honour: retire­ <lb/>
            ment from business is pleasant, but inglorious and mean." <lb/>
            One ought to say at once to such a one, " ' Stranger, quite <lb/>
            different now you look to what you did before.’4 I do not <lb/>
            need a friend to change his opinions with me and to assent <lb/>
            to me in everything, my shadow will do that better, but <lb/>
            I need one that will speak the truth and help me with his <lb/>
            judgement." This is one way of detecting the flatterer. <note type="footnote"> 1 Plato was somewhat of a traveller, he three times visited Syracuse, <lb/>
            and also travelled in Egypt. </note><note type="footnote"> a As to the polypus, see “On Abundance of Friends," § ix. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 As " Fumum et opes strepitumque Romæ."-Horace, " Odes," iii. <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>§ ix. We must also observe another difference in the <lb/>
            resemblance between the friend and flatterer. The true <lb/>
            friend does not imitate you in everything, nor is he too <lb/>
            keen to praise, but praises only what is excellent, for as <lb/>
            Sophocles says, <lb/>
            "He is not born to share in hate but love,”1 <lb/>
            yes, by Zeus, and he is born to share in doing what is right <lb/>
            and in loving what is noble, and not to share in wrong-doing <lb/>
            or misbehaviour, unless it be that, as a running of the eyes is <lb/>
            catching, so through companionship and intimacy be may <lb/>
            against his will contract by infection some vice or in <lb/>
            habit, as they say Plato's intimates imitated his stoop, <lb/>
            Aristotle's his lisp, and king Alexander's his holding his <lb/>
            head a little on one side, and rapidity of utterance in con­ <lb/>
            versation,2 for people mostly pick up unawares such traits <lb/>
            of character. But the flatterer is exactly like the chameleon,3 <lb/>
            which takes every colour but white, and so he, though unable <lb/>
            to imitate what is worth his while, leaves nothing that is <lb/>
            bad unimitated. And just as poor painters unable to make <lb/>
            a fine portrait from inefficiency in their craft, bring out the <lb/>
            likeness by painting all the wrinkles, moles and scars, so <lb/>
            the flatterer imitates his friend's intemperance, superstition, <lb/>
            hot temper, sourness to domestics, suspicion of his friends <lb/>
            and relations. For he is by nature inclined to what is <lb/>
            worst, and thinks that imitation of what is bad is as far as <lb/>
            possible removed from censure. For those are suspected <lb/>
            who have noble aims in life, and seem to be vexed and dis­ <lb/>
            gusted at their friends' faults, for that injured and even <lb/>
            ruined Dion with Dionysius, Samins with Philip, and Cleo­ <lb/>
            menes with Ptolemy. But he that wishes to be and appear <lb/>
            at the same time both agreeable and trustworthy pretends <note type="footnote"> 1 Sophocles, Antigone," 523. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 As to these traits in Plato and Aristotle, compare "De Audiendis <lb/>
            Poetis,” § viii. And as to Alexander, Plutarch tells us in his Life <lb/>
            that he used to hold his head a little to the left, " Life," p. 666 B. See <lb/>

              to rejoice more in what is bad, as being through excessive <lb/>
              love for his friend not even offended at his vices, but as <lb/>
              one with him in feeling and nature in all matters. And so <lb/>
              they claim to share in involuntary and chance ailments, <lb/>
              and pretend to have the same complaints, in flattery to <lb/>
              those who suffer from any, as that their eyesight and sense <lb/>
              of hearing are deficient, if their friends are somewhat blind <lb/>
              or deaf, as the flatterers of Dionysius, who was rather short- <lb/>
              sighted, jostled one another at a dinner party, and knocked <lb/>
              the dishes off the table, as if from defect of vision.1 And <lb/>
              some to make their cases more similar wind themselves in <lb/>
              closer, and dive even into family secrets for parallels. For <lb/>
              seeing that their friends are unfortunate in marriage, or <lb/>
              suspicions about the behaviour of their sons or relations, <lb/>
              they do not spare themselves, but make quite a Jeremiad <lb/>
              about their own sons, or wife, or kinsfolk, or relations, pro­ <lb/>
              claiming loudly their own family secrets. For similarity <lb/>
              in situation makes people more sympathetic, and their <lb/>
              friends having received as it were hostages by their con­ <lb/>
              fessions, entrust them in return with their secrets, and <lb/>
              having once made confidants of them, dare not take back <lb/>
              their confidence.2 I actually know of a man who turned his <lb/>
              wife out of doors because his friend had put away his; but <lb/>
              as he secretly visited her and sent messages to her, he was <lb/>
              detected by his friend's wife noticing his conduct. So <lb/>
              little did he know the nature of a flatterer that thought <lb/>
              the following lines more applicable to a crab than a <lb/>
              flatterer, " His whole body is belly, his eye is on every­ <lb/>
              thing, he is a creature creeping on his teeth," for such is a <lb/>
              true picture of the parasite, " friends of the frying-pan, <lb/>
              hunting for a dinner," to borrow the language of Eupolis.</p>
          <p>§ x. However let us put off all this to its proper place in <lb/>
            the discourse. But let us not fail to notice the wiliness of <lb/>
            the flatterer's imitation, in that, even if he imitates any good <lb/>
            points in the person he flatters, he always takes care to give <lb/>
            him the palm. Whereas among real friends there is no <lb/>
            rivalry or jealousy of one another, but they are satisfied <lb/>
            and contented alike whether they are equal or one of them <note type="footnote"> I See Athenæus, 249 F; 435 E. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Cf. Juv. iii. 113: “ Scire volunt secreta dooms, atque inde timeri." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="164"/>
            is superior. But the flatterer, ever remembering that he is <lb/>
            to play second fiddle,1 makes his copy always fall a little <lb/>
            short of the original, for he admits that he is everywhere <lb/>
            outstripped and left behind, except in vice. For in that <lb/>
            alone he claims pre-eminence, for if his friend is peevish, he <lb/>
            says he is atrabilious; if his friend is superstitious, he says <lb/>
            he is a fanatic ; if his friend is in love, he says he is madly <lb/>
            in love; if his friend laughs, he will say, "You laughed a <lb/>
            little unseasonably, but I almost died of laughter." But <lb/>
            in regard to any good points his action is quite the oppo­ <lb/>
            site. He says he can run quickly, but his friend flies; he <lb/>
            says he can ride pretty well, but his friend is a Centaur <lb/>
            on horseback. He says " I am not a bad poet, and don't <lb/>
            write very bad lines, <lb/>
            “‘But your sonorous verse is like Jove'a thunder.'" <lb/>
            Thus he shows at once that his friend's aims in life are <lb/>
            good, and that his friend has reached a height he cannot <lb/>
            soar to. Such then are the differences in the resemblances <lb/>
            between the flatterer and the friend.</p>
          <p>§ xi. But since, as has been said before, to give plea­ <lb/>
            sure is common to both, for the good man delights in his <lb/>
            friends as much as the bad man in his flatterers, let us con­ <lb/>
            sider the difference between them here too. The difference <lb/>
            lies in the different aim of each in giving pleasure. Look <lb/>
            at it this way. There is no doubt a sweet smell in per­ <lb/>
            fume. So there is also in medicine. But the difference <lb/>
            is that while in perfume pleasure and nothing else is de­ <lb/>
            signed, in medicine either purging, or warming, or adding <lb/>
            flesh to the system, is the primary object, and the sweet <lb/>
            smell is only a secondary consideration. Again painters <lb/>
            mix gay colours and dyes: there are also some drugs which <lb/>
            are gay in appearance and not unpleasing in colour. What <lb/>
            then is the difference between these ? Manifestly we dis­ <lb/>
            tinguish by the end each aims at. So too the social life of <lb/>
            friends employs mirth to add a charm to some good and <lb/>
            useful end, and sometimes makes joking and a good table <lb/>
            and wine, aye, and even chaff and banter, the seasoning to <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_44_fig3.jpg"/></figure><note type="footnote"> 2 As Lord Stowell used to say that dinners lubricated business." </note> <lb/>
               <pb n="165"/>
              noble and serious matters, as in the line, <lb/>
              " Much they enjoyed talking to one another,”1 <lb/>
              and again, <lb/>
              " Never did ought else <lb/>
              Disturb our love or joy in one another." 2 <lb/>
              But the flatterer's whole aim and end is to cook up and <lb/>
              season his joke or word or action, so as to produce pleasure. <lb/>
              And to speak concisely, the flatterer's object is to please in <lb/>
              everything he does, whereas the true friend always does <lb/>
              what is right, and so often gives pleasure, often pain, not <lb/>
              wishing the latter, but not shunning it either, if he deems <lb/>
              it best. For as the physician, if it be expedient, infuses <lb/>
              saffron or spikenard, aye, or uses some soothing fomenta­ <lb/>
              tion or feeds his patient up liberally, and sometimes orders <lb/>
              castor, <lb/>
              " Or poley,3 that so strong and foully smells," <lb/>
              or pounds hellebore and compels him to drink it,-neither <lb/>
              in the one case making unpleasantness, nor in the other <lb/>
              pleasantness, his end and aim, but in both studying only <lb/>
              the interest of his patient,-so the friend sometimes by <lb/>
              praise and kindness, extolling him and gladdening his <lb/>
              heart, leads him to what is noble, as Agamemnon, <lb/>
              "Teucer, dear head, thou son of Telamon, <lb/>
              Go on thus shooting, captain of thy men ;”4 <lb/>
              or Diomede, <lb/>
              " How could I e'er forget divine Odysseus ? "5 <lb/>
              But where on the other hand there is need of correction, <lb/>
              then he rebukes with biting words and with the freedom <lb/>
              worthy of a friend, <lb/>
              " Zeus-cherished Menelaus, art thou mad, <lb/>
              And in thy folly tak'st no heed of safety ? " 6 <lb/>
              Sometimes also he joins action to word, as Menedemus <lb/>
              sobered the profligate and disorderly son of his friend <lb/>
              Asclepiades, by shutting him out of his house, and not <lb/>
              speaking to him. And Arcesilaus forbade Bato his school, <note type="footnote"> 1 Homer, “Iliad," xi. 643. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 Homer, “Odyssey,” iv. 178, 179. </note> <note type="footnote"> 8 Perhaps the poley-germander. See Pliny, " Nat. Hist. xxi. 84. <lb/>

              when he wrote a line in one of his plays against Cleanthes, <lb/>
              and only got reconciled with him after he repented and <lb/>
              made his peace with Cleanthes. For we ought to give our <lb/>
              friend pain if it will benefit him, but not to the extent <lb/>
              of breaking off our friendship; but just as we make use of <lb/>
              some biting medicine, that will save and preserve the life <lb/>
              of the patient. And so the friend, like a musician, in <lb/>
              bringing about an improvement to what is good and ex­ <lb/>
              pedient, sometimes slackens the chords, sometimes tightens <lb/>
              them, and is often pleasant, but always useful. But the <lb/>
              flatterer, always harping on one note, and accustomed to <lb/>
              play his accompaniment only with a view to please and to <lb/>
              ingratiate himself, knows not how either to oppose in <lb/>
              deed, or give pain in word, but complies only with <lb/>
              every wish, ever chiming in with and echoing the senti­ <lb/>
              ments of his patron. As then Xenophon says Agesilaus <lb/>
              took pleasure in being praised by those who would also <lb/>
              censure him,l so ought we to think that to please and <lb/>
              gratify us is friendly in the person who can also give us <lb/>
              pain and oppose us, but to feel suspicion at an intercourse <lb/>
              which is merely for pleasure and gratification, and never <lb/>
              pungent, aye and by Zeus to have ready that saying of the <lb/>
              Lacedæmonian, who, on hearing king Charillus praised, <lb/>
              said, " How can he be a good man, who is not severe even <lb/>
              to the bad ? "</p>
          <p>§ XII. They say the gadfly attacks bulls, and the tick <lb/>
            dogs, in the ear: so the flatterer besieges with praise the <lb/>
            ears of those who are fond of praise, and sticks there and <lb/>
            is hard to dislodge. We ought therefore here to make a <lb/>
            wide-awake and careful discrimination, whether the praise <lb/>
            is bestowed on the action or the man. It is bestowed on <lb/>
            the action, if people praise the absent rather than the present, <lb/>
            if also those that have the same aims and aspirations praise <lb/>
            not only us but all that are similarly disposed, and do not <lb/>
            evidently say and do one thing at one time, and the direct <lb/>
            contrary at another; and the greatest test is if we are <lb/>
            conscious, in the matters for which we get the praise, that <lb/>
            we have not regretted them, and are not ashamed at them, <lb/>
            and would not rather have said and done differently. For <note type="footnote"> 1 Xenophon, “Agesilaus,” xi. 5. p. 673 C. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="167"/>
            our own inward judgement, testifying the contrary and not <lb/>
            admitting the praise, is above passion, and impregnable <lb/>
            and proof against the flatterer. But I know not how it is <lb/>
            that most people in misfortune cannot bear exhortation, but <lb/>
            are captivated more by condolence and sympathy, and <lb/>
            when they have done something wrong and acted amiss, <lb/>
            he that by censure and blame implants in them the stings of <lb/>
            repentance is looked upon by them as hostile and an accuser, <lb/>
            while they welcome and regard as friendly and well-dis­ <lb/>
            posed to them the person who bestows praise and pane­ <lb/>
            gyric on what they have done. Those then that readily <lb/>
            praise and join in applauding some word or action on the part <lb/>
            of someone whether in jest or earnest, only do temporary <lb/>
            harm for the moment, but those who injure the character <lb/>
            by their praise, aye, and by their flattery undermine the <lb/>
            morals, act like those slaves who do not steal from the bin, <lb/>
            but from the seed corn.1 For they pervert the disposition, <lb/>
            which is the seed of actions, and the character, which is <lb/>
            the principle and fountain of life, by attaching to vice <lb/>
            names that belong properly only to virtue. For as Thucy­ <lb/>
            dides says,2 in times of faction and war people change <lb/>
            the accustomed meaning of words as applied to acts at <lb/>
            their will and pleasure, for reckless daring is then con­ <lb/>
            sidered bravery to one's comrades, and prudent delay <lb/>
            specious cowardice, and sober-mindedness the cloak of <lb/>
            the coward, and taking everything into account before <lb/>
            action a real desire to do nothing." So too in the case of <lb/>
            flattery we must observe and be on our guard against <lb/>
            wastefulness being called liberality, and cowardliness pru­ <lb/>
            dence, and madness quick-wittedness, and meanness fru­ <lb/>
            gality, and the amorous man called social and affectionate, <lb/>
            and the term manly applied to the passionate and vain <lb/>
            man, and the term civil applied to the paltry and mean <lb/>
            man. As I remember Plato3 says the lover is a flatterer <note type="footnote"> 1 To filch the grain from the bin or granary would not of course be <lb/>
            so important a theft as to steal the seed-stock preserved for sowing. So <lb/>

            of the beloved one, and calls the snub nose graceful, and the <lb/>
            aquiline nose royal, and swarthy people manly, and fair <lb/>
            people the children of the gods, and the olive complexion <lb/>
            is merely the lover's phrase to gloss over and palliate <lb/>
            excessive pallor. And yet the ugly man persuaded he is <lb/>
            handsome, or the short man persuaded he is tall, cannot <lb/>
            long remain in the error, and receives only slight injury <lb/>
            from it, and not irreparable mischief: but praise applied to <lb/>
            vices as if they were virtues, so that one is not vexed but <lb/>
            delighted with a vicious life, removes all shame from wrong­ <lb/>
            doing, and was the ruin of the Sicilians, by calling the <lb/>
            savage cruelty of Dionysius and Phalaris detestation of <lb/>
            wickedness and uprightness. It was the ruin of Egypt, <lb/>
            by styling Ptolemy's effeminacy, and superstition, and <lb/>
            bowlings, and beating of drums, religion and service to the <lb/>
            gods.1 It was nearly the overthrow and destruction of the <lb/>
            ancient manners of the Romans, palliating the luxury and <lb/>
            intemperance and display of Antony as exhibitions of <lb/>
            jollity and kindliness, when his power and fortune were at <lb/>
            their zenith. What else invested Ptolemy3 with his pipe <lb/>
            and fiddle ? What else brought Nero3 on the tragic stage, <lb/>
            and invested him with the mask and buskins ? Was it not <lb/>
            the praise of flatterers ? And are not many kings called <lb/>
            Apollos if they can just sing a song,4 and Dionysuses if <lb/>
            they get drunk, and Herculeses if they can wrestle, and do <lb/>
            they not joy in such titles, and are they not dragged into <lb/>
            every kind of disgrace by flattery ?</p>
          <p>§ XIII. Wherefore we must be especially on our guard <lb/>
            against the flatterer in regard to praise; as indeed he is <lb/>
            very well aware himself, and clever to avoid suspicion. If <lb/>
            he light upon some dandy, or rustic in a thick leather <lb/>
            garment, he treats him with nothing but jeers and mocks,5 <lb/>
            as Struthias insulted Bias, ironically praising him for his <lb/>
            stupidity, saying, "You have drunk more than king Alex- <note type="footnote"> 1 This Ptolemy was a votary of Cybele, and a spiritual ancestor of <lb/>

            ander,”1 and, it that he was ready to die of laughing at his <lb/>
            tale about the Cyprian.”2 But when he sees people more <lb/>
            refined very much on their guard, and observing both time <lb/>
            and place, he does not praise them directly, but draws off <lb/>
            a little and wheels round and approaches them noiselessly, <lb/>
            as one tries to catch a wild animal. For sometimes he <lb/>
            reports to a man the panegyric of other persons upon him, <lb/>
            (as orators do, introducing some third person,) saying that <lb/>
            he had a very pleasant conversation in the market with <lb/>
            some strangers and men of worth, who mentioned how they <lb/>
            admired his many good points. On another occasion he <lb/>
            concocts and fabricates some false and trifling charges <lb/>
            against him, pretending he has heard them from other <lb/>
            people, and runs up with a serious face and inquires, where <lb/>
            he said or did such and such a thing. And upon his deny­ <lb/>
            ing he ever did, he pounces on him at once3 and com­ <lb/>
            pliments his man with, " I thought it strange that you. <lb/>
            should have spoken ill of your friends, seeing that you <lb/>
            don't even treat your enemies so: and that you should <lb/>
            have tried to rob other people, seeing that you are so lavish <lb/>
            with your own money." A</p>
          <p>§ xiv. Other flatterers again, just as painters heighten the <lb/>
            effect of their pictures by the combination of light and <lb/>
            shade, so by censure abuse detraction and ridicule of the <lb/>
            opposite virtues secretly praise and foment the actual vices <lb/>
            of those they flatter. Thus they censure modesty as merely <lb/>
            rustic behaviour in the company of profligates, and greedy <lb/>
            people, and villains, and such as have got rich by evil and <lb/>
            dishonourable courses; and contentment and uprightness <lb/>
            they call having no spirit or energy in action; and when <lb/>
            they associate with lazy and idle persons who avoid all <lb/>
            public duties, they are not ashamed to call the life of a <lb/>
            citizen wearisome meddling in other people's affairs, and <lb/>
            the desire to bold office fruitless vain-glory. And some ere <lb/>
            now to flatter an orator have depreciated a philosopher, and <lb/>
            others won favour with wanton women by traducing those <lb/>
            wives who are faithful to their husbands as constitutionally <lb/>
            cold and country bred. And by an acme of villainy flatterers <note type="footnote"> 1 See Athenæus, p. 434 C. </note><note type="footnote"> a As Gnatho in Terence, " Eunuch.” 496-498. </note><note type="footnote">3 Reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑλών</foreign> as Courier, Hercher. - </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="170"/>
            do not always spare even themselves. For as wrestlers <lb/>
            stoop that they may the easier give their adversaries a fall, <lb/>
            so by censuring themselves they glide into praising others. <lb/>
            " I am a cowardly slave," says such a one, " at sea, I shirk <lb/>
            labour, I am madly in rage if a word is said against me ; <lb/>
            but this man fears nothing, has no vices, is a rare good <lb/>
            fellow, patient and easy in all circumstances.” But if a <lb/>
            person has an excellent idea of his own good sense, and <lb/>
            desires to be austere and self-opinionated, and in his moral <lb/>
            rectitude is ever spouting that line of Homer, <lb/>
            " Tydides, neither praise nor blame me much,”1 <lb/>
            the artistic flatterer does not attack him as he attacked <lb/>
            others, but employs against such a one a new device. For <lb/>
            he comes to him about his own private affairs, as if desirous <lb/>
            to have the advice of one wiser than himself; he has, he <lb/>
            says, more intimate friends, but he is obliged to trouble him ; <lb/>
            "for whither shall we that are deficient in judgement go ? <lb/>
            whom shall we trust?" And having listened to his <lb/>
            utterance he departs, saying he has received an oracle not <lb/>
            an opinion. And if he notices that somebody lays claim to <lb/>
            experience in oratory, he gives him some of his writings, and <lb/>
            begs him to read and correct them. So, when king Mithri­ <lb/>
            dates took a fancy to play the surgeon, several of his friends <lb/>
            offered themselves for operating upon, as for cutting or <lb/>
            cauterizing, flattering in deed and not in word, for his <lb/>
            being credited by them would seem to prove his skill.2 <lb/>
            " For Providence has many different aspects." 3 <lb/>
            But .we can test this kind of negative praise, that needs <lb/>
            more wary caution, by purposely giving strange advice and <lb/>
            suggestions, and by adopting absurd corrections. For if <lb/>
            he raises no objection but nods assent to everything, and <lb/>
            approves of everything, and is always crying out, " Good! <lb/>
            How admirable ! " he is evidently <lb/>
            “Asking advice, but seeking something else," <lb/>
            wishing by praise to puff you up. <note type="footnote"> 1 " Iliad," x. 249. They are words of Odysseus. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This was carrying flattery rather far. “Mithridatis medicinæ <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>§ xv. Moreover, as some have defined painting to be <lb/>
            silent poetry,1 so is there praise in silent flattery. For as <lb/>
            hunters are more likely to catch the objects of their chase <lb/>
            unawares, if they do not openly appear to be so engaged, <lb/>
            but seem to be walking, or tending their sheep, or looking <lb/>
            after the farm, so flatterers obtain most success in their <lb/>
            praise, when they do not seem to be praising but to be <lb/>
            doing something else. For he who gives up his place or <lb/>
            seat to the great man when he comes in, and while making <lb/>
            a speech to the people or senate breaks off even in the <lb/>
            middle, if he observes any rich man wants to speak, and <lb/>
            gives up to him alike speech and platform, shows by his <lb/>
            silence even more than he would by any amount of vocife­ <lb/>
            ration that he thinks the other the better man, and superior <lb/>
            to him in judgement. And consequently you may always <lb/>
            see them occupying the best places at theatres and public <lb/>
            assembly rooms, not that they think themselves worthy of <lb/>
            them, but that they may flatter the rich by giving up their <lb/>
            places to them ; and at public meetings they begin speaking <lb/>
            first, and then make way as for better men, and most <lb/>
            readily take back their own view, if any influential or rich <lb/>
            or famous person espouse the contrary view. And so one <lb/>
            can see plainly that all such servility and drawing back on <lb/>
            their part is a lowering their sails, not to experience or <lb/>
            virtue or age, but to wealth and fame. Not so Apelles the <lb/>
            famous painter, who, when Megabyzus sat with him, and <lb/>
            wished to talk about lines and shades, said to him, " Do <lb/>
            you see my lads yonder grinding colours, they admired <lb/>
            just now your purple and gold, but now they are laughing <lb/>
            at you for beginning to talk about what you don't under­ <lb/>
            stand." 2 And Solon, when Crœsus asked him about <lb/>
            happiness, replied that Tellus, an obscure Athenian, and <lb/>
            Bito and Cleobis were happier than he was.3 But flatterers <lb/>
            proclaim kings and rich men and rulers not only happy <lb/>
            and fortunate, but also pre-eminent for wisdom, and art, <lb/>
            and every virtue. ^ <note type="footnote"> 1 Oar author gives this definition to Simonides, “ De Gloria Athe­ <lb/>

          <p>§ XVI. Now some cannot bear to hear the assertion of <lb/>
            the Stoics1 that the wise man is at once rich, and hand­ <lb/>
            some, and noble, and a king; but flatterers declare that <lb/>
            the rich man is at once orator and poet, and (if he likes) <lb/>
            painter, and flute-player, and swift-footed, and strong, <lb/>
            falling down if he wrestles with them, and if contending <lb/>
            with him in running letting him win the race, as Crisso of <lb/>
            Himera purposely allowed Alexander to outrun him, which <lb/>
            vexed the king very much when he heard of it.2 And <lb/>
            Carneades said that the sons of rich men and kings learnt <lb/>
            nothing really well and properly except how to ride, for <lb/>
            their master praised and flattered them in their studies, <lb/>
            and the person who taught them wrestling always let <lb/>
            them throw him, whereas the horse, not knowing or caring <lb/>
            whether his rider were a private person or ruler, rich or <lb/>
            poor, soon threw him over his head if he could not ride <lb/>
            well. Simple therefore and fatuous was that remark of <lb/>
            Bion, " If you could by encomiums make your field to yield <lb/>
            well and be fruitful, you could not be thought wrong in <lb/>
            tilling it so rather than digging it and labouring in it: nor <lb/>
            would it be strange in you to praise human beings if by so <lb/>
            doing you could be useful and serviceable to them." For <lb/>
            a field does not become worse by being praised, but those <lb/>
            who praise a man falsely and against his deserts puff him <lb/>
            up and ruin him.</p>
          <p>§ xvii. Enough has been said on this matter: let us now <lb/>
            examine outspokenness. For just as Patroclus put on the <lb/>
            armour of Achilles, and drove his horses to the battle, only <lb/>
            durst not touch his spear from Mount Pelion, but let that <lb/>
            alone, so ought the flatterer, tricked out and modelled in <lb/>
            the distinctive marks and tokens of the friend, to leave <lb/>
            untouched and uncopied only his outspokenness, as the <lb/>
            special burden of friendship, "heavy, huge, strong.”3 But <lb/>
            since flatterers, to avoid the blame they incur by their <lb/>
            buffoonery, and drinking, and gibes, and jokes, sometimes <lb/>
            work their ends by frowns and gravity, and intermix cen. <note type="footnote"> 1 “Nobile Stoæ Paradoxum. Cicero Fin. iii. 22, ex persona <lb/>

            sure and reproof, let us not pass this over either without <lb/>
            examination. And I think, as in Menander's Play the sham <lb/>
            Hercules comes on the stage not with a club stout and <lb/>
            strong, but with a light and hollow cane, so the outspoken­ <lb/>
            ness of the flatterer is to those who experience it mild and <lb/>
            soft, and the very reverse of vigorous, and like those <lb/>
            cushions for women's heads, which seem able to stand <lb/>
            their ground, but in reality yield and give way under <lb/>
            their pressure; so this sham outspokenness is puffed up <lb/>
            and inflated with an empty and spurious and hollow <lb/>
            bombast, that when it contracts and collapses draws in the <lb/>
            person who relies on it. For true and friendly outspoken­ <lb/>
            ness attacks wrong-doers, bringing pain that is salutary <lb/>
            and likely to make them more careful, like honey biting <lb/>
            but cleansing ulcerated parts of the body,1 but in other <lb/>
            respects serviceable and sweet. But we will speak of this <lb/>
            anon.2 But the flatterer first exhibits himself as disagreeable <lb/>
            and passionate and unforgiving in his dealings with others. <lb/>
            For he is harsh to his servants, and a terrible fellow to <lb/>
            attack and ferret out the faults of his kinsmen and friends, <lb/>
            and to look up to and respect nobody who is a stranger, <lb/>
            but to look down upon them, and is relentless and mischief- <lb/>
            making in making people provoked with others, hunting after <lb/>
            the reputation of hating vice, as one not likely knowingly to <lb/>
            mince matters with the vicious, or ingratiate himself with <lb/>
            them either in word or deed. Next he pretends to know <lb/>
            nothing of real and great crimes, but he is a terrible fellow <lb/>
            to inveigh against trifling and external shortcomings, and <lb/>
            to fasten on them with intensity and vehemence, as if he sees <lb/>
            any pot or pipkin out of its place, or anyone badly housed, <lb/>
            or neglecting his beard or attire, or not adequately attend­ <lb/>
            ing to a horse or dog. But contempt of parents, and neg­ <lb/>
            lect of children, and bad treatment of wife, and haughtiness <lb/>
            to friends, and throwing away money, all this he cares <lb/>
            nothing about, but is silent and does not dare to make any <lb/>
            allusion to it: just as if the trainer in a gymnasium were <lb/>
            to allow the athlete to get drunk and live in debauchery,3 <note type="footnote"> 1 Our author has used this illustration again in "Phocion," p. <lb/>

            and yet be vexed at the condition of his oil-flask or <lb/>
            strigil if out of order; or as if the schoolmaster scolded a <lb/>
            boy about his tablet and pen, but paid no attention to a <lb/>
            solecism or barbarism. The flatterer is like a man who <lb/>
            should make no comment on the speech of a silly and <lb/>
            ridiculous orator, but should find fault with his voice, and <lb/>
            chide him for injuring his throat by drinking cold water; <lb/>
            or like a person bidden to read some wretched composition, <lb/>
            who should merely find fault with the thickness of the <lb/>
            paper, and call the copyist a dirty and careless fellow. So <lb/>
            too when Ptolemy seemed to desire to become learned, his <lb/>
            flatterers used to spin out the time till midnight, disputing <lb/>
            about some word or line or history, but not one of them all <lb/>
            objected to his cruelty and outrages, his torturing and <lb/>
            beating people to death.1 Just as if, when a man has <lb/>
            tumours and fistulas, one were to cut his hair and nails <lb/>
            with a surgeon's knife, so flatterers use outspokenness only <lb/>
            in cases where it gives no pain or distress.</p>
          <p>§ XVIII. Moreover some of them are cleverer still and <lb/>
            make their outspokenness and censure a means of impart­ <lb/>
            ing pleasure. As Agis the Argive,2 when Alexander be­ <lb/>
            stowed great gifts on a buffoon, cried out in envy and dis­ <lb/>
            pleasure, “What a piece of absurdity! " and on the king <lb/>
            turning angrily to him and saying, " What are you talking <lb/>
            about ? " he replied, " I admit that I am vexed and put out, <lb/>
            when I see that all you descendants of Zeus alike take de­ <lb/>
            light in flatterers and jesters, for Hercules had his Cercopes, <lb/>
            and Dionysus his Sileni, and with you too I see that such <lb/>
            are held in good repute." And on one occasion, when the <lb/>
            Emperor TLberius entered the senate, one of his flatterers <lb/>
            got up and said, that being free men they ought to be out­ <lb/>
            spoken, and not suppress or conceal anything that might <lb/>
            be important, and having by this exordium engaged every­ <lb/>
            body's attention, a dead silence prevailing, and even Tibe­ <lb/>
            rius being all attention, he said, " Listen, Cœsar, to what <lb/>
            we all charge you with, although no one ventures to tell <lb/>
            you openly of it; you neglect yourself, and are careless <note type="footnote"> I Reading with Hercher <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀποτυμπανίζοντος ϰα</foreign>ì <foreign xml:lang="grc">στρεβλου̃ντος</foreign>. This <lb/>

            about your health, and wear yourself out with anxiety and <lb/>
            labour on our behalf, taking no rest either by night or day." <lb/>
            And on his stringing much more together in the same <lb/>
            strain, they say the orator Cassius Severus said, "This <lb/>
            outspokenness will ruin the man."</p>
          <p>§ xix. These are indeed trifling matters : but the follow­ <lb/>
            ing are more important and do mischief to foolish people, <lb/>
            when flatterers accuse them of the very contrary vices and <lb/>
            passions to those to which they are really addicted; as <lb/>
            Himerius the flatterer twitted a very rich, very mean, and <lb/>
            very covetous Athenian with being a careless spendthrift, and <lb/>
            likely one day to want bread as well as his children; or on the <lb/>
            other hand if they rail at extravagant spendthrifts for mean­ <lb/>
            ness and sordidness, as Titus Petronius railed at Nero; or ex­ <lb/>
            hort rulers who make savage and cruel attacks on their sub­ <lb/>
            jects to lay aside their excessive clemency, and unseasonable <lb/>
            and inexpedient mercy. Similar to these is the person who <lb/>
            pretends to be on his guard against and afraid of a silly <lb/>
            stupid fellow as if he were clever and cunning; and the <lb/>
            one who, if any person fond of detraction, rejoicing in defa­ <lb/>
            mation and censure, should be induced on any occasion to <lb/>
            praise some man of note, fastens on him and alleges against <lb/>
            him that he has an itch for praising people. “ You are <lb/>
            always extolling people of no merit: for who is this fellow, <lb/>
            or what has he said or done out of the common ? " But it <lb/>
            is in regard to the objects of their love that they mostly <lb/>
            attack those they flatter, and additionally inflame them. <lb/>
            For if they see people at variance with their brothers, or <lb/>
            despising their parents, or treating their wives contemp­ <lb/>
            tuously, they neither take them to task nor scold them, but <lb/>
            fan the flame of their anger still more. " You don't suffi­ <lb/>
            ciently appreciate yourself," they say, "you are yourself <lb/>
            the cause of your being put upon in this way, through your <lb/>
            constant submissiveness and humility." And if there is <lb/>
            any tiff or fit of jealousy in regard to some courtesan or <lb/>
            adulteress, the flatterer is at hand with remarkable out­ <lb/>
            spokenness, adding fuel to flame,1 and taking the lady's part, <lb/>
            and accusing her lover of acting in a very unkind harsh <lb/>
            and shameful manner to her, <note type="footnote"> I A common proverb among the ancients. See " Conjugal Precepts," <lb/>

            “0 ingrate, after all those frequent kisses !" 1 <lb/>
            Thus Antony's friends, when he was passionately in love <lb/>
            with the Egyptian woman,2 persuaded him that he was <lb/>
            loved by her, and twitted him with being cold and haughty <lb/>
            to her. " She," they said, " has left her mighty kingdom <lb/>
            and happy mode of life, and is wasting her beauty, taking <lb/>
            the field with you like some camp-follower, <lb/>
            " The while your heart is proof 'gainst all her charms,”3 <lb/>
            as you neglect her love-lorn as she is." But he that is <lb/>
            pleased at being reproached with his wrong-doing, and <lb/>
            delights in those that censure him, as he never did in those <lb/>
            that praised him, is unconscious that he is really perverted <lb/>
            also by what seems to be rebuke. For such outspoken­ <lb/>
            ness is like the bites of wanton women,4 that while seeming <lb/>
            to hurt really tickle and excite pleasure. And just as if <lb/>
            people mix pure wine, which is by itself an antidote against <lb/>
            hemlock, with it and so offer it, they make the poison quite <lb/>
            deadly, being rapidly carried to the heart by the warmth,5 <lb/>
            so ill-disposed men, knowing that outspokenness is a great <lb/>
            antidote to flattery, make it a means of flattering. And so <lb/>
            it was rather a bad answer Bias6 made, to the person <lb/>
            who inquired what was the most formidable animal, " Of <lb/>
            wild animals the tyrant, and of tame the flatterer." For it <lb/>
            would have been truer to observe that tame flatterers are <lb/>
            those that are found round the baths and table, but the <lb/>
            one that intrudes into the interior of the house and into the <lb/>
            women's apartments with his curiosity and calumny and <lb/>
            malignity, like the legs and arms of the polypus, is wild <lb/>
            and savage and unmanageable.</p>

            know and ever remember that, whereas the soul contains <lb/>
            true and noble and reasoning elements, as also unreasoning <lb/>
            and false and emotional ones, the friend is always a coun­ <lb/>
            sellor and adviser to the better instincts of the soul, as the <lb/>
            physician improves and maintains health, whereas the <lb/>
            flatterer works upon the emotional and unreasoning ones, <lb/>
            and tickles and titillates them and seduces them from <lb/>
            reason, employing sensuality as his bait. As then there <lb/>
            are some kinds of food which neither benefit the blood or <lb/>
            spirit, nor brace up the nerves and marrow, but stir the <lb/>
            passions, excite the lower nature, and make the flesh un­ <lb/>
            sound and rotten, so the language of the flatterer adds <lb/>
            nothing to soberness and reason, but encourages some <lb/>
            love passion, or stirs up foolish rage, or incites to envy, <lb/>
            or produces the empty and burdensome vanity of pride, or <lb/>
            joins in bewailing woes, or ever by his calumnies and hints <lb/>
            makes malignity and illiberality and suspicion sharp and <lb/>
            timid and jealous, and cannot fail to be detected by those <lb/>
            that closely observe him. For he is ever anchoring himself <lb/>
            upon some passion, and fattening it, and, like a bubo, <lb/>
            fastens himself on some unsound and inflamed parts of the <lb/>
            soul. Are you angry ? Have your revenge, says he. Do <lb/>
            you desire anything ? Get it. Are you afraid ? Let us <lb/>
            flee. Do you suspect? Entertain no doubts about it. <lb/>
            But if he is difficult to detect in thus playing upon our <lb/>
            passions, since they often overthrow reason by their in­ <lb/>
            tensity and strength, he will give a handle to find him <lb/>
            out in smaller matters, being consistent in them too. For <lb/>
            if anyone feels a little uneasy after a surfeit or excess in <lb/>
            drink, and so is a little particular about his food and doubts <lb/>
            the advisability of taking a bath, a friend will try and check <lb/>
            him from excess, and bid him be careful and not indulge, <lb/>
            whereas the flatterer will drag him to the bath, bid him <lb/>
            serve up some fresh food, and not starve himself and so <lb/>
            injure his constitution. And if he see him reluctant about <lb/>
            a journey or voyage or some business or other, he will say <lb/>
            that there is no hurry, that it's all one whether the business <lb/>
            be put off, or somebody else despatched to look after it. <lb/>
            And if you have promised to lend or give some money to a <lb/>
            friend, but have repented of your offer, and yet feel <lb/>
            ashamed not to keep your promise, the flatterer will throw <note type="footnote"> N </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="178"/>
            his influence into the worse scale, he will confirm your <lb/>
            desire to save your purse, he will destroy your reluctance, <lb/>
            and will bid you be careful as having many expenses, and <lb/>
            others to think about besides that person. And so, unless <lb/>
            we are entirely ignorant of our desires, our shamelessness, <lb/>
            and our timidity, the flatterer cannot easily escape our <lb/>
            detection. For he is ever the advocate of those passions, <lb/>
            and outspoken when we desire to repress them.1 But so <lb/>
            much for this matter.</p>
          <p>§ xxi. Now let us pass on to useful and kind services, <lb/>
            for in them too the flatterer makes it very difficult and <lb/>
            confusing to detect him from the friend, seeming to be <lb/>
            zealous and ready on all occasions and never crying off. <lb/>
            For, as Euripides says,2 a friend's behaviour is, " like the <lb/>
            utterance of truth, simple," and plain and inartificial, while <lb/>
            that of the flatterer “is is in itself unsound, and needs wise <lb/>
            remedies," aye, by Zeus, and many such, and not ordinary <lb/>
            ones. As for example in chance meetings the friend often <lb/>
            neither speaks nor is spoken to, but merely looks and smiles, <lb/>
            and then passes on, showing his inner affection and good­ <lb/>
            will only by his countenance, which his friend also re­ <lb/>
            ciprocates, but the flatterer runs up, follows, holds out his <lb/>
            hand at a distance, and if he is seen and addressed first, <lb/>
            frequently protests with oaths, and calls witnesses to prove, <lb/>
            that he did not see you. So in business friends neglect <lb/>
            many unimportant points, are not too punctilious and <lb/>
            officious, and do not thrust themselves upon every service, <lb/>
            but the flatterer is persevering and unceasing and in­ <lb/>
            defatigable in it, giving nobody else either room or place <lb/>
            to help, but putting himself wholly at your disposal, and if <lb/>
            you will not find him something to do for you, he is <lb/>
            troubled, nay rather altogether dejected and lamenting <lb/>
            loudly.3</p>
          <p>§ XXII. To all sensible people all this is an indication, <lb/>
            not of true or sober friendship, but of a meretricious one, <note type="footnote"> 1 So Wyttenbach, who reads <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνστάεις</foreign>, and translates, "et libertate <lb/>

            that embraces you more warmly than there is any occasion <lb/>
            for. Nevertheless let us first look at the difference <lb/>
            between the friend and flatterer in their promises. For it <lb/>
            has been well said by those who have handled this subject <lb/>
            before us, that the friend's promise is, <lb/>
            "If I can do it, and 'tis to be done," <lb/>
            but the flatterer's is, <lb/>
            “Speak out your mind, whatever it is, to me.”1 <lb/>
            And the comic dramatists put such fellows on the stage, <lb/>
            “Nicomachus, pit me against that soldier, <lb/>
            See if I beat him not into a jelly, <lb/>
            And make his face e'en softer than a sponge."2 <lb/>
            In the next place no friend participates in any matter, <lb/>
            unless he has first been asked his advice, and put the <lb/>
            matter to the test, and set it on a suitable and expedient <lb/>
            basis. But the flatterer, if anyone allows him to examine <lb/>
            a matter and give his opinion on it, not only wishes to <lb/>
            gratify him by compliance, but also fearing to be looked <lb/>
            upon with suspicion as unwilling and reluctant to en­ <lb/>
            gage in the business, gives in to and even urges on his <lb/>
            friend's desire. For there is hardly any king or rich man <lb/>
            who would say, <lb/>
            “0 that a beggar I could find, or worse <lb/>
            Than beggar, if, with good intent to me, <lb/>
            He would lay bare his heart boldly and honestly ;”3 <lb/>
            but, like the tragedians, they require a chorus of sympa­ <lb/>
            thizing friends, or the applause of a theatre. And so <lb/>
            Merope gives the following advice in the tragedy, <lb/>
            “Choose you for friends those who will speak their mind, <lb/>
            For those bad men that only speak to please <lb/>
            See that you bolt and bar out of your house.”4 <lb/>
            But they act just the contrary, for they turn away with <lb/>
            horror from those who speak their mind, and hold different <note type="footnote"> 1 These are two successive lines found three times in Homer, " Iliad," <lb/>

            views as to what is expedient, while they welcome those <lb/>
            bad and illiberal impostors (that only speak to please them) <lb/>
            not only within their houses, but also to their affections <lb/>
            and secrets. Now the simpler of these do not think right <lb/>
            or claim to advise you in important matters, but only to <lb/>
            assist in the carrying out of them : but the more cunning <lb/>
            one stands by during the discussion, and knits his brows, <lb/>
            and nods assent with his head, but says nothing, but if his <lb/>
            friend express an opinion, he then says, " Hercules, you <lb/>
            only just anticipated me, I was about to make that very <lb/>
            remark." For as the mathematicians tell us that surfaces <lb/>
            and lines neither bend nor extend nor move of themselves, <lb/>
            being without body and only perceived by the mind, but <lb/>
            only bend and extend and change their position with the <lb/>
            bodies whose extremities they are: so you will catch the <lb/>
            flatterer ever assenting with, and agreeing with, aye, and <lb/>
            feeling with, and being angry with, another, so easy of <lb/>
            detection in all these points of view is the difference <lb/>
            between the friend and the flatterer. Moreover as regards <lb/>
            the kind of good service. For the favour done by a friend, <lb/>
            as the principal strength of an animal is within, is not for <lb/>
            display or ostentation, but frequently as a doctor cures his <lb/>
            patient imperceptibly, so a friend benefits by his interven­ <lb/>
            tion, or by paying off creditors, or by managing his friend's <lb/>
            affairs, even though the person who receives the benefit <lb/>
            may not be aware of it. Such was the behaviour of <lb/>
            Arcesilaus on various occasions, and when Apelles1 of Chios <lb/>
            was ill, knowing his poverty, he took with him twenty <lb/>
            drachmae when he visited him, and sitting down beside <lb/>
            him he said, " There is nothing here but those elements of <lb/>
            Empedocles, ‘fire and water and earth and balmy expanse <lb/>
            of air,' but you don't lie very comfortably," and with that <lb/>
            he moved his pillow, and privately put the money under it. <lb/>
            And when his old housekeeper found it, and wonderingly <lb/>
            told Apelles of it, he laughed and said, " This is some <lb/>
            trick of Arcesilaus." And the saying is also true in <lb/>
            philosophy that children are like their parents.”2 For <note type="footnote"> 1 We know from Athenæus, p. 420 D, that Apelles and Arcesilaus <lb/>

            when Cephisocrates had to stand his trial on a bill of <lb/>
            indictment, Lacydes (who was an intimate friend of Arce­ <lb/>
            silaus) stood by him with several other friends, and <lb/>
            when the prosecutor asked for his ring, which was the <lb/>
            principal evidence against him, Cephisocrates quietly <lb/>
            dropped it on the ground, and Lacydes noticing this put <lb/>
            his foot on it and so hid it. And after sentence was pro­ <lb/>
            nounced in his favour, Cephisocrates going up to thank <lb/>
            the jury, one of them who had seen the artifice told him <lb/>
            to thank Lacydes, and related to him all the matter, <lb/>
            though Lacydes had not said a word about it to anybody. <lb/>
            So also I think the gods do often perform benefits secretly, <lb/>
            taking a natural delight in bestowing their favours and <lb/>
            bounties.1 But the good service of the flatterer has no <lb/>
            justice, or genuineness, or simplicity, or liberality about it; <lb/>
            but is accompanied with sweat, and running about, and <lb/>
            noise, and knitting of the brow, creating an impression <lb/>
            and appearance of toilsome and bustling service, like a <lb/>
            painting over-curiously wrought in bold colours, and with <lb/>
            bent folds wrinkles and angles, to make the closer re­ <lb/>
            semblance to life. Moreover he tires one by relating what <lb/>
            journeys and anxieties he has had over the matter, how <lb/>
            many enemies he has made over it, the thousand bothers <lb/>
            and annoyances he has gone through, so that you say, <lb/>
            " The affair was not worth all this trouble." For being <lb/>
            reminded of any favour done to one is always unpleasant <lb/>
            and disagreeable and insufferable:2 but the flatterer not <lb/>
            only reminds us of his services afterwards, but even during <lb/>
            the very moment of doing them upbraids us with them <lb/>
            and is importunate. But the friend, if he is obliged to <lb/>
            mention the matter, relates it modestly, and says not a <lb/>
            word about himself. And so, when the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            sent corn to the people of Smyrna that needed it, and the <lb/>
            people of Smyrna wondered at their kindness, the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            m'onians said, " It was no great matter, we only voted that <note type="footnote"> I See the beautiful story of Baucis and Philemon, Ovid, " Meta­ <lb/>

            we and our beasts of burden should go without our dinner <lb/>
            one day, and sent what was so saved to you.”1 Not only <lb/>
            is it handsome to do a favour in that way, but it is more <lb/>
            pleasant to the receivers of it, because they think those <lb/>
            who have done them the service have done it at no great <lb/>
            loss to themselves.</p>
          <p>§ XXIII. But it is not so much by the importunity of <lb/>
            the flatterer in regard to services, nor by his facility in <lb/>
            making promises, that one can recognize his nature, as <lb/>
            by the honourable or dishonourable kind of service, and <lb/>
            by the regard to please or to be of real use. For the <lb/>
            friend is not as Gorgias defined him, one who will ask <lb/>
            his friend to help him in what is right, while he will <lb/>
            himself do many services for his friend that are not <lb/>
            right. <lb/>
            “For friend should share in good not in bad action.”2 <lb/>
            He will therefore rather try and turn him away from what <lb/>
            is not becoming, and if he cannot persuade him, good is <lb/>
            that answer of Phocion to Antipater, "You cannot have <lb/>
            me both as friend and flatterer,”3 that is, as friend and no <lb/>
            friend. For one must indeed assist one's friend but not do <lb/>
            anything wrong for him, one must advise with him but not <lb/>
            plot with him, one must bear witness for him but not join <lb/>
            him in fraud, one must certainly share adversity with him <lb/>
            but not crime. For since we should not wish even to <lb/>
            know of our friends' dishonourable acts, much less should <lb/>
            we desire to share their dishonour by acting with them. <lb/>
            As then the Lacedæmonians, when conquered in battle by <lb/>
            Antipater, on settling the terms of peace, begged that he <lb/>
            would lay upon them what burdens he pleased, provided <lb/>
            he enjoined nothing dishonourable, so the friend, if any <lb/>
            necessity arise involving expense or danger or trouble, is <lb/>
            the first to desire to be applied to and share in it with <lb/>
            alacrity and without crying off, but if there be anything <lb/>
            disgraceful in connection with it he begs to have nothing <lb/>
            to do with it. The flatterer on the contrary cries off from <note type="footnote"> I A similar story about the Samians and Lacedæmonians is told by <lb/>
            Aristotle, “Œconom.” ii. 9. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 A line from Euripides, " Iphigenia in Aulis,” 407. </note><note type="footnote"> 8 Also in " Conjugal Precepts," § xxix. </note> <lb/>

            toilsome and dangerous employments, and if you put him <lb/>
            to the test by ringing him,1 he returns a hollow and <lb/>
            spurious sound, and finds some excuse ; whereas use him in <lb/>
            disgraceful and low and disreputable service, and trample <lb/>
            upon him, he will think no treatment too bad or igno­ <lb/>
            minious. Have you observed the ape ? He cannot guard <lb/>
            the house like the do,,,, nor bear burdens like the horse, nor <lb/>
            plough like the ox, so he has to bear insult and ribaldry, <lb/>
            and put up with being made sport of, exhibiting himself <lb/>
            as an instrument to produce laughter. So too the flatterer, <lb/>
            who can neither advocate your cause, nor give you useful <lb/>
            counsel, nor share in your contention with anybody, but <lb/>
            shirks all labour and toil, never makes any excuses in <lb/>
            underhand transactions, is sure to lend a helping hand in <lb/>
            any love affair, is energetic in setting free some harlot, and <lb/>
            not careless in clearing off the account of a drinking score, <lb/>
            nor remiss in making preparations for banquets, and obse­ <lb/>
            quious to concubines, but if ordered to be uncivil to your <lb/>
            relations, or to help in turning your wife out of doors, he <lb/>
            is relentless and not to be put out of countenance. So that <lb/>
            he is not hard to detect here too. For if ordered to do <lb/>
            anything you please disreputable or dishonourable, he is <lb/>
            ready to take any pains to oblige you.</p>
          <p>§ XXIV. One might detect again how greatly the flatterer <lb/>
            differs from the friend by his behaviour to other friends. For <lb/>
            the friend is best pleased with loving and being beloved by <lb/>
            many, and also always tries to contrive for his friend that <lb/>
            he too may be much loved and honoured, for he believes in <lb/>
            the proverb " the goods of friends are common property," 2 <lb/>
            and thinks it ought to apply to nothing more than to <lb/>
            friends; but the false and spurious and counterfeit friend, <lb/>
            knowing how much he debases friendship, like debased and <lb/>
            spurious coin, is not only by nature envious, but shows <lb/>
            his envy even of those who are like himself, striving to <lb/>
            outdo them in scurrility and gossip, while he quakes <lb/>
            and trembles at any of his betters, not by Zeus " merely <lb/>
            walking on foot by their Lydian chariot," but, to use the <lb/>
            language of Simonides, " not even having pure lead by <note type="footnote"> 1 See Persius, iii. 21, 22, with Jahn's Note. </note><note type="footnote"> I See " On Love," § xxi. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="184"/>
            comparison with their refined gold.”1 Whenever then, <lb/>
            being light and counterfeit and false, he is put to the test <lb/>
            at close quarters with a true and solid and cast-iron friend­ <lb/>
            ship, he cannot stand the test but is detected at once, and <lb/>
            imitates the conduct of the painter that painted some <lb/>
            wretched cocks, for he ordered his lad to scare away all live <lb/>
            cocks as far from his picture as possible. So he too scares <lb/>
            away real friends and will not let them come near if he can <lb/>
            help it, but if he cannot prevent that, he openly fawns upon <lb/>
            them, and courts them, and admires them as his betters, <lb/>
            but privately runs them down and spreads calumnies about <lb/>
            them. And when secret detraction has produced a sore <lb/>
            feeling,2 if he has not effected his end completely, he re­ <lb/>
            members and observes the teaching of Medius, who was <lb/>
            the chief of Alexander's flatterers, and a leading sophist in <lb/>
            conspiracy against the best men. He bade people conn­ <lb/>
            dently sow their calumny broadcast and bite with it, <lb/>
            teaching them that even if the person injured should <lb/>
            heal his sore, the scar of the calumny would remain. Con­ <lb/>
            sumed by these scars, or rather gangrenes and cancers, <lb/>
            Alexander put to death Callisthenes, and Parmenio, and <lb/>
            Philotas; while he himself submitted to be completely out­ <lb/>
            witted by such as Agnon, and Bagoas, and Agesias, and <lb/>
            Demetrius, who worshipped him and tricked him up and <lb/>
            feigned him to be a barbaric god. So great is the <lb/>
            power of flattery, and nowhere greater, as it seems, than <lb/>
            among the greatest people. For their thinking and <lb/>
            wishing the best about themselves makes them credit the <lb/>
            flatterer, and gives him courage.3 For lofty heights are <lb/>
            difficult of approach and hard to reach for those who <note type="footnote"> 1 “Auri plumbique oppositio fere proverbialis est. Petronius, Saty­ <lb/>

            endeavour to scale them, but the highmindedness and <lb/>
            conceit of a person thrown off his balance by good fortune <lb/>
            or good natural parts is easily reached by mean and petty <lb/>
            people.</p>
          <p>§ xxv. And so we advised at the beginning of this dis­ <lb/>
            course, and now advise again, to cut off self-love and too high <lb/>
            an opinion of ourselves; for that flatters us first, and makes <lb/>
            us more impressionable and prepared for external flatterers, <lb/>
            But if we hearken to the god, and recognize the immense <lb/>
            importance to everyone of that saying, " Know thyself,”1 and <lb/>
            at the same time carefully observe our nature and education <lb/>
            and training, with its thousand shortcomings in respect to <lb/>
            good, and the large proportion of vice and vanity mixed up <lb/>
            with our words and deeds and feelings, we shall not make our­ <lb/>
            selves so easy a mark for flatterers. Alexander said that he <lb/>
            disbelieved those who called him a god chiefly in regard to <lb/>
            sleep and the sexual delight, for in both those things he <lb/>
            was more ignoble and emotional than in other respects.2 <lb/>
            So we, if we observe the blots, blemishes, shortcomings, <lb/>
            and imperfections of our private selves, shall perceive <lb/>
            clearly that we do not need a friend who shall bestow upon <lb/>
            us praise and panegyric, but one that will reprove us, and <lb/>
            speak plainly to us, aye, by Zeus, and censure us if we <lb/>
            have done amiss. For it is only a few out of many that <lb/>
            venture to speak plainly to their friends rather than <lb/>
            gratify them, and even among those few you will not <lb/>
            easily find any who know how to do so properly, for they <lb/>
            think they are outspoken when they abuse and scold. And <lb/>
            yet, just as in the case of any other medicine, to employ <lb/>
            freedom of speech unseasonably is only to give needless pain <lb/>
            and trouble, and in a manner to do so as to produce vexa­ <lb/>
            tion the very thing the flatterer does so as to produce <lb/>
            pleasure. For it does people harm not only to praise them <lb/>
            unseasonably but also to blame them unseasonably, and es­ <lb/>
            pecially exposes them to the successful attack of flatterers, <lb/>
            for, like water, they abandon the rugged hills for the soft <lb/>
            grassy valleys. And so outspokenness ought to be <lb/>
            tempered with kindness, and reason ought to be called in <note type="footnote"> 1 Compare § i. </note><note type="footnote">2 Compare our Author, " Quaestiones Convivalium,” viii. p. 717 F. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="186"/>
            to correct its excessive tartness, (as we tone down the <lb/>
            too powerful glare of a lamp), that people may not, by <lb/>
            being troubled and grieved at continual blame and rebuke, <lb/>
            fly for refuge to the shade of the flatterer, and turn aside <lb/>
            to him to free themselves from annoyance. For we ought, <lb/>
            Philopappus, to banish all vice by virtue, not by the opposite <lb/>
            vice, as some hold; by exchanging modesty for impudence, <lb/>
            and countrified ways for town ribaldry, and by removing <lb/>
            their character as far as possible from cowardice and effemi­ <lb/>
            nacy, even if that should make people get very near to auda­ <lb/>
            city and foolhardiness. And some even make superstition <lb/>
            a plea for atheism, and stupidity a plea for knavery, per­ <lb/>
            verting their nature, like a stick bent double, from inability <lb/>
            to set it straight. But the basest disowning of flattery is <lb/>
            to be disagreeable without any purpose in view, and it <lb/>
            shows an altogether inelegant and clumsy unfitness for <lb/>
            social intercourse to shun by unpleasing moroseness the <lb/>
            suspicion of being mean and servile in friendship ; like the <lb/>
            freedman in the comedy who thought railing only enjoying <lb/>
            freedom of speech. Seeing then that it is equally disgrace­ <lb/>
            ful to become a flatterer through trying only to please, as <lb/>
            in avoiding flattery to destroy all friendship and intimacy <lb/>
            by excessive freedom of speech, we must avoid both these <lb/>
            extremes, and, as in any other case, make our freedom of <lb/>
            speech agreeable by its moderation. So the subject itself <lb/>
            seems next to demand that I should conclude it by dis­ <lb/>
            cussing that point.</p>
          <p>§ xxvi. As then we see that much trouble arises from <lb/>
            excessive freedom of speech, let us first of all detach from <lb/>
            it any element of self-love, being carefully on our guard <lb/>
            that we may not appear to upbraid on account of any <lb/>
            private hurt or injury. For people do not regard a speech <lb/>
            on the speaker's own behalf as arising from goodwill, but <lb/>
            from anger, and reproach rather than admonition. For <lb/>
            freedom in speech is friendly and has weight, but reproach <lb/>
            is selfish and little. And so people respect and admire <lb/>
            those that speak their mind freely, but accuse back and <lb/>
            despise those that reproach them : as Agamemnon would <lb/>
            not stand the moderate freedom of speech of Achilles, but <note type="footnote"> 1 So Horace, “ Satires," i. 2, 24 <unclear>2</unclear> “ Dum vitant stulti vitia in con­ <lb/>
            traria curruut." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="187"/>
            submitted to and endured the bitter attack and speech of <lb/>
            Odysseus, <lb/>
            " Pernicious chief, would that thou didst command <lb/>
            Some sorry host, and not such men as these! ” 1 <lb/>
            for he was restrained by the carefulness and sobriety of his <lb/>
            speech, and also Odysseus had no private motive of anger <lb/>
            but only spoke out on behalf of Greece,2 whereas Achilles <lb/>
            seemed rather vexed on his own account. And Achilles <lb/>
            himself, though not sweet-tempered or mild of mood, but <lb/>
            " a terrible man, and one that would perchance blame an <lb/>
            innocent person,” 3 yet silently listened to Patroclus <lb/>
            bringing against him many such charges as the following, <lb/>
            " Pitiless one, thy sire never was <lb/>
            Knight Peleus, nor thy mother gentle Thetis, <lb/>
            But the blue sea and steep and rocky crags <lb/>
            Thy parents were, so flinty is thy heart.”4 <lb/>
            For as Hyperides the orator bade the Athenians consider <lb/>
            not only whether he spoke bitterly, but whether he spoke <lb/>
            so from interested motives,5 so the rebuke of a friend void <lb/>
            of all private feeling is solemn and grave and what one dare <lb/>
            not lightly face. And if anyone shows plainly in his free­ <lb/>
            dom of speech, that he altogether passes over and dismisses <lb/>
            any offences his friend has done to himself, and only blames <lb/>
            him for other shortcomings, and does not spare him but <lb/>
            gives him pain for the interests of others, the tone of his <lb/>
            outspokenness is invincible, and the sweetness of his <lb/>
            manner even intensifies the bitterness and austerity of his <lb/>
            rebuke. And so it has well been said, that in anger and <lb/>
            differences with our friends we ought more especially to <lb/>
            act with a view to their interest or honour. And no less <lb/>
            friendly is it, when it appears that we have been passed over <lb/>
            and neglected, to boldly put in a word for others that are <lb/>
            neglected too, and to remind people of them, as Plato, when <lb/>
            he was out of favour with Dionysius, begged for an <note type="footnote"> 1 Homer, “ Iliad," xiv. 84, 85. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Compare Cicero, " De Officiis," i. 25 : " Omnis autem animadversio <lb/>
            et castigatio contumelia vacare debet : neque ad ejus, qui punitur <lb/>

             <pb n="188"/>
            audience, and Dionysius granted it, thinking that Plato <lb/>
            had some personal grievance and was going to enter into it, <lb/>
            but Plato opened the conversation as follows, " If, Dio­ <lb/>
            nysins, you knew that some enemy had sailed to Sicily <lb/>
            with a view to do you some harm, but found no opportunity, <lb/>
            would you allow him to sail back again, and go off scot- <lb/>
            free ? " " Certainly not, Plato," replied Dionysius, " for <lb/>
            we must not only hate and punish the deeds of our <lb/>
            enemies, but also their intentions." " If then," said Plato, <lb/>
            "anyone has come here for your benefit, and wishes to <lb/>
            do you good, and you do not find him an opportunity, is <lb/>
            it right to let him go away with neglect and without <lb/>
            thanks ? " And on Dionysius asking, who he meant, he <lb/>
            replied, " I mean AEschines, a man of as good a character <lb/>
            as any of Socrates' pupils whatever, and able to improve <lb/>
            by his conversation any with whom he might associate: <lb/>
            and he is neglected, though he has made a long voyage <lb/>
            here to discuss philosophy with you." This speech so <lb/>
            affected Dionysius, that he at once threw his arms round <lb/>
            Plato and embraced him, admiring his benevolence and <lb/>
            loftiness of mind, and treated Æschines well and hand­ <lb/>
            somely.</p>
          <p>§ XXVII. In the next place, let us clear away as it were <lb/>
            and remove all insolence, and jeering, and mocking, and <lb/>
            ribaldry, which are the evil seasonings of freedom of speech. <lb/>
            For as, when the surgeon performs an operation, a certain <lb/>
            neatness and delicacy of touch ought to accompany his use <lb/>
            of the knife, but all pantomimic and venturesome and <lb/>
            fashionable suppleness and over-finicalness ought to be far <lb/>
            away from his hand, so freedom of speech admits of dex­ <lb/>
            terity and politeness, provided that a pleasant way of put­ <lb/>
            ting it does not destroy the power of the rebuke, for impu­ <lb/>
            dence and coarseness and insolence, if added to freedom of <lb/>
            speech, entirely mar and ruin the effect. And so the <lb/>
            harper plausibly and elegantly silenced Philip, who ven­ <lb/>
            tured to dispute with him about proper playing on the <lb/>
            harp, by answering him, “ God forbid that you should be so <lb/>
            unfortunate, 0 king, as to understand harping better than <lb/>
            me." But that was not a right answer of Epicharmus, <lb/>
            when Hiero a few days after putting to death some of his <lb/>
            friends invited him to supper, " You did not invite me," he <lb/>
             <pb n="189"/>
            said, "the other day, when you sacrificed your friends." <lb/>
            Bad also was that answer of Antiphon, who, when Diony­ <lb/>
            sius asked him " which was the best kind of bronze," <lb/>
            answered, " That of which the Athenians made statues of <lb/>
            Harmodius and Aristogiton." For this unpleasant and <lb/>
            bitter kind of language profits not those that use it, nor <lb/>
            does scurrility and puerile jesting please, but such kind of <lb/>
            speeches are indications of an incontinent tongue inspired <lb/>
            by hate, and full of malignity and insolence, and those who <lb/>
            use such language do but ruin themselves, recklessly dancing <lb/>
            on the verge of a well.1 For Antiphon was put to death by <lb/>
            Dionysius, and Timagenes lost the friendship of Augustus, <lb/>
            not by using on any occasion too free a tongue, but at <lb/>
            supper-parties and walks always declining to talk seriously, <lb/>
            "only saying what he knew would make the Argives <lb/>
            laugh,” 2 and thus virtually charging friendship with being <lb/>
            only a cloak for abuse. For even the comic poets have in­ <lb/>
            troduced on the stage many grave sentiments well adapted <lb/>
            to public life, but joking and ribaldry being mixed with <lb/>
            them, like insipid sauces with food, destroy their effect and <lb/>
            make them lose their nourishing power, so that the comic <lb/>
            poets only get a reputation for malignity and coarseness, <lb/>
            and the audience get no benefit from what is said. We <lb/>
            may on other occasions jest and laugh with our friends, but <lb/>
            let our outspokenness be coupled with seriousness and <lb/>
            gravity, and if it be on important matters, let our speech <lb/>
            be trustworthy and moving from its pathos, and animation, <lb/>
            and tone of voice. And on all occasions to let an oppor­ <lb/>
            tunity slip by is very injurious, but especially does it <lb/>
            destroy the usefulness of freedom of speech. It is plain <lb/>
            therefore that we must abstain from freedom of speech <lb/>
            when men are in their cups. For he disturbs the harmony <lb/>
            of a social gathering3 who, in the midst of mirth and <lb/>
            jollity, introduces a topic that shall knit the brows and <lb/>
            contract the face, and shall act as a damper to the Lysian4 <note type="footnote"> 1 A proverb of persons on the brink of destruction. Wells among the <lb/>
            ancients were uncovered. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 "Iliad," ii. 215, of Thersites. As to Theagenes, see Seneca, " De <lb/>

            god, who, as Pindar says, " looses the rope of all our cares <lb/>
            and anxieties." There is also great danger in such ill­ <lb/>
            timed freedom of speech. For wine makes people easily <lb/>
            slip into rage, and oftentimes freedom of speech in liquor <lb/>
            makes enemies. And generally speaking it is not noble or <lb/>
            brave but cowardly to conceal your ideas when people are <lb/>
            sober and to give free vent to them at table, snarling like <lb/>
            cowardly dogs. We need say no more therefore on this <lb/>
            head.</p>
          <p>§ XXVIII. But since many people do not think fit or even <lb/>
            dare to find fault with their friends when in prosperity, but <lb/>
            think that condition altogether out of the reach and range <lb/>
            of rebuke, but inveigh against them if they have made <lb/>
            a slip or stumble, and trample upon them if they are in de­ <lb/>
            jection and in their power, and, like a stream swollen above <lb/>
            its banks, pour upon them then the torrent of all their elo­ <lb/>
            quence,1 and enjoy and are glad at their reverse of fortune, <lb/>
            owing to their former contempt of them when they were <lb/>
            poor themselves, it is not amiss to discuss this somewhat, <lb/>
            and to answer those words of Euripides, <lb/>
            “ What need of friends, when things go well with us ? " 2 <lb/>
            for those in prosperity stand in especial need of friends <lb/>
            who shall be outspoken to them, and abate their excessive <lb/>
            pride. For there are few who are sensible in prosperity, <lb/>
            most need to borrow wisdom from others, and such consi­ <lb/>
            derations as shall keep them lowly when puffed up and <lb/>
            giving themselves airs owing to their good fortune. But <lb/>
            when the deity has abased them and stripped them of their <lb/>
            conceit, there is something in their very circumstances to <lb/>
            reprove them and bring about a change of mind. And so <lb/>
            there is no need then of a friendly outspokenness, nor of <lb/>
            weighty or caustic words, but truly in such reverses " it is <lb/>
            sweet to look into the eyes of a friendly person, ” 3 consoling <note type="footnote"> sanias, ix. 16. Lyæus is suggested by Wyttenbach, and read by <lb/>

            and cheering one up : as Xenophon tells us that the sight <lb/>
            of Clearchus in battle and dangers, and his calm benevolent <lb/>
            face, inspired courage in his men when in peril. But he <lb/>
            who uses to a man in adversity too great freedom and <lb/>
            severity of speech, like a man applying too pungent a <lb/>
            remedy to an inflamed and angry eye, neither cures him nor <lb/>
            abates his pain, but adds anger to his grief, and exasperates <lb/>
            his mental distress. For example anyone well is not at all <lb/>
            angry or fierce with a friend, who blames him for his <lb/>
            excesses with women and wine, his laziness and taking no <lb/>
            exercise, his frequent baths, and his unseasonable surfeit­ <lb/>
            ing : but to a person ill all this is unsufferable, and even <lb/>
            worse than his illness to hear, " All this has happened to you <lb/>
            through your intemperance, and luxury, your dainty food, <lb/>
            and love for women." The patient answers, " How <lb/>
            unseasonable is all this, good sir! I am making my will, <lb/>
            the doctors are preparing me a dose of castor and scam­ <lb/>
            mony, and you are scolding me and plying me with philo­ <lb/>
            sophy." And thus the affairs of the unfortunate do not <lb/>
            admit of outspokenness and a string of Polonius-like saws, <lb/>
            but they require kindness and help. For when children <lb/>
            fall down their nurses do not run up to them and scold, but <lb/>
            pick them up, and clean them, and tidy their dress, and after­ <lb/>
            wards find fault and correct them. The story is told of <lb/>
            Demetrius of Phalerum, when an exile from his native <lb/>
            country, and living a humble and obscure life at Thebes, <lb/>
            that he was not pleased to see Crates approaching, for he <lb/>
            expected to receive from him cynical outspokenness and <lb/>
            harsh language. But as Crates talked kindly to him, and <lb/>
            discussed his exile, and pointed out that there was no evil <lb/>
            in it, or anything that ought to put him about, for he had <lb/>
            only got rid of the uncertainties and dangers of public life, <lb/>
            and at the same time bade him trust in himself and his <lb/>
            condition of mind, Demetrius cheered up and became <lb/>
            happier, and said to his friends, " Out upon all my former <lb/>
            business and employments, that left me no leisure to know <lb/>
            such a man as this ! " <lb/>
            " For friendly speech is good to one in grief, <lb/>
            While bitter language only suits the fuol.” 2 <note type="footnote"> <lb/>
            1 " Anabasis," ii. 6, 11. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 Perhaps by Euripides. </note> <lb/>

            This is the way with generous friends. But the ignoble <lb/>
            and low flatterers of those in prosperity, as Demosthenes <lb/>
            says fractures and sprains always give us pain again when <lb/>
            the body is not well,1 adhere to them in reverses, as if they <lb/>
            were pleased at and enjoyed them. But indeed if there ba <lb/>
            any need of reminding a man of the blunders he committed <lb/>
            through unadvisedly following his own counsel, it is enough <lb/>
            to say, " This was not to my mind, indeed I often tried to <lb/>
            dissuade you from it.”2</p>
          <p>§ xxix. In what cases then ought a friend to be vehe­ <lb/>
            ment, and when ought he to use emphatic freedom of lan­ <lb/>
            guage ? When circumstances call upon him to check some <lb/>
            headlong pleasure or rage or insolence, or to curtail avarice, <lb/>
            or to correct some foolish negligence. Thus Solon spoke <lb/>
            out to Crœsus, who was corrupted and enervated by inse­ <lb/>
            cure good fortune, bidding him look to the end.3 Thus <lb/>
            Socrates restrained Alcibiades, and wrung from him <lb/>
            genuine tears by his reproof, and changed his heart.4 Such <lb/>
            also was the plain dealing of Cyrus with Cyaxares, and of <lb/>
            Plato with Dion, for when Dion was most famous and <lb/>
            attracted to himself the notice of all men, by the splendour <lb/>
            and greatness of his exploits, Plato warned him to fear and <lb/>
            be on his guard against " pleasing only himself, for so he <lb/>
            would lose all his friends.”5 Speusippus also wrote to him <lb/>
            not to plume himself on being a great person only with lads <lb/>
            and women, but to see to it that by adorning Sicily with <lb/>
            piety and justice and good laws he might make the Academy <lb/>
            glorious. On the other hand Euctus and Eulæus, com­ <lb/>
            panions of Perseus, in the days of his prosperity ingra­ <lb/>
            tiated themselves with him, and assented to him in all <lb/>
            things, and danced attendance upon him, like all the other <lb/>
            courtiers, but when he fled after his defeat by the Romans <lb/>
            at Pydna, they attacked him and censured him bitterly, re­ <lb/>
            minding him and upbraiding him in regard to everything <lb/>
            he had done amiss or neglected to do, till he was so greatly <note type="footnote"> 1 “ Olynth." ii. p. 8 C; " Pro Corona," 341 C. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Homer, " Iliad," ix. 108, 109. They are the words of Nestor to Aga. <lb/>

             <pb n="193"/>
            exasperated both from grief and rage that he whipped out <lb/>
            his sword and killed both of them.</p>
          <p>§ xxx. Let so much suffice for general occasions of free­ <lb/>
            dom of speech. There are also particular occasions, which <lb/>
            our friends themselves furnish, that one who really cares for <lb/>
            his friends will not neglect, but make use of. In some <lb/>
            cases a question, or narrative, or the censure or praise of <lb/>
            similar things in other people, gives as it were the cue for <lb/>
            freedom of speech. Thus it is related that Demaratus <lb/>
            came to Macedonia from Corinth at the time when Philip <lb/>
            was at variance with his wife and son, and when the king <lb/>
            asked if the Greeks were at harmony with one another, <lb/>
            Demaratus, being his well-wisher and friend, answered, <lb/>
            " It is certainly very rich of you, Philip, inquiring as to <lb/>
            concord between the Athenians and Peloponnesians, when <lb/>
            you don't observe that your own house is full of strife and <lb/>
            varia,nce.” 1 Good also was the answer of Diogenes, who, <lb/>
            when Philip was marching to fight against the Greeks, <lb/>
            stole into his camp, and was arrested and brought before <lb/>
            him, and the king not recognizing him asked if he was a <lb/>
            spy, " Certainly," replied he, " Philip, I have come to spy <lb/>
            out your inconsiderate folly, which makes you, under no <lb/>
            compulsion, come here and hazard your kingdom and life on <lb/>
            a moment's 2 cast of the die." This was perhaps rather too <lb/>
            strong a remark.</p>
          <p>§ xxxi. Another suitable time for reproof is when people <lb/>
            have been abused by others for their faults, and have con­ <lb/>
            sequently become humble, and abated their pride. The <lb/>
            man of tact will ingeniously seize the occasion, checking <lb/>
            and baffling those that used the abuse, but privately speak­ <lb/>
            ing seriously to his friend, and reminding him, that he <lb/>
            ought to be more careful if for no other reason than to take <lb/>
            off the edge of his enemies' satire. He will say, " How can <lb/>
            they open their mouths against you, or what can they <lb/>
            urge, if you give up and abandon what you get this bad <lb/>
            name about ? " Thus pain comes only from abuse, but <lb/>
            profit from reproof. And some correct their friends more <note type="footnote"> 1 See our author," Apophthegmata,” p. 179 C. </note><note type="footnote"> ' Compare Horace, " Satires," i. 1. 7, 8: " Quid enim, concurritur: <lb/>

             <pb n="194"/>
            daintily by blaming others; censuring others for what they <lb/>
            know are their friends' faults. Thus my master Am* <lb/>
            monius in afternoon school, noticing that some of his pupils <lb/>
            had not dined sufficiently simply, bade one of his freedmen <lb/>
            scourge his own son, charging him with being unable <lb/>
            to get through his dinner without vinegary but in acting <lb/>
            thus he had an eye to us, so that this indirect rebuke <lb/>
            touched the guilty persons.</p>
          <p>§ XXXII. We must also beware of speaking too freely to <lb/>
            a friend in the company of many people, remembering the <lb/>
            well-known remark of Plato. For when Socrates reproved <lb/>
            one of his friends too vehemently in a discussion at table, <lb/>
            Plato said, " Would it not have been better to have said <lb/>
            this privately ? " Whereupon Socrates replied, " And you <lb/>
            too, sir, would it not have become you to make this <lb/>
            remark also privately ? ” And Pythagoras having re­ <lb/>
            buked one of his pupils somewhat harshly before many <lb/>
            people, they say the young fellow went off and hung him­ <lb/>
            self, and from that moment Pythagoras never again <lb/>
            rebuked anyone in another's presence. For, as in the case <lb/>
            of some foul disease, so also in the case of wrong-doing we <lb/>
            ought to make the detection and exposure private, and <lb/>
            not ostentatiously public by bringing witnesses and spec­ <lb/>
            tators. For it is not the part of a friend but a sophist to <lb/>
            seek glory by the ill-fame of another, and to show off in <lb/>
            company, like the doctors that perform wonderful cures in <lb/>
            the theatres as an advertisement.2 And independently of <lb/>
            the insult, which ought not to be an element in any cure, <lb/>
            we must remember that vice is contentious and obstinate. <lb/>
            For it is not merely " love," as Euripides says, that " if <lb/>
            checked becomes more vehement," but an unsparing rebuke <lb/>
            before many people makes every infirmity and vice more <lb/>
            impudent. As then Plato' urges old men who want to teach <lb/>
            the young reverence to act reverently to them first them­ <lb/>
            selves, so among friends a gentle rebuke is gently taken, and <note type="footnote"> I And so being dainty. See Athenæus, ii. ch. 76. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 We see from this and other places that the mountebanks and <lb/>
            quacks of the Middle Ages and later times existed also among the <lb/>

             <pb n="195"/>
            a cautious and careful approach and mild censure of the <lb/>
            wrong-doer undermines and destroys vice, and makes its <lb/>
            own modesty catching. So that line is most excellent, <lb/>
            " holding his head near, that the others might not hear." 1 <lb/>
            And most especially indecorous is it to expose a husband <lb/>
            in the hearing of his wife, or a father before his children, <lb/>
            or a lover in the presence of the loved one, or a master <lb/>
            before his scholars. For people are beside themselves with <lb/>
            pain and rage if reproached before those with whom they <lb/>
            desire to be held in good repute. And I think it was not so <lb/>
            much wine that exasperated Alexander with Clitus, as his <lb/>
            seeming to put him down in the presence of many people. <lb/>
            And Aristomenes, the tutor of Ptolemy,2 because he went <lb/>
            up to the king and woke him as he was asleep in an <lb/>
            audience of some ambassadors, gave a handle to the king's <lb/>
            flatterers who professed to be indignant on his behalf, and <lb/>
            said, "If after your immense state-labours and many vigils <lb/>
            you have been overpowered by sleep, he ought to have <lb/>
            rebuked you privately, and not put his hands upon you <lb/>
            before so many people." And Ptolemy sent for a cup of <lb/>
            poison and ordered the poor man to drink it up. And <lb/>
            Aristophanes said Cleon blamed him for " railing against <lb/>
            the state when strangers were present,” 3 and so irritating <lb/>
            the Athenians. We ought therefore to be very much on our <lb/>
            guard in relation to this point too as well as others, if we <lb/>
            wish not to make a display and catch the public ear, but. <lb/>
            to use our freedom of speech for beneficial purposes and to <lb/>
            cure vice. Moreover, what Thucydides has represented <lb/>
            the Corinthians saying of themselves, that they had a <lb/>
            right to blame their neighbours," 4 is not a bad precept for <lb/>
            those to remember who intend to use freedom of speech. <lb/>
            Lysander, it seems, on one occasion said to a Megarian, <lb/>
            who was speaking somewhat boldly on behalf of Greece <lb/>
            among the allies, " Your words require a state to back <note type="footnote"> 1 Homer, “ Odyssey," i. 157 ; iv. 70; xvii. 592. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Ptolemy V., Epiphanes. The circumstances are related by <lb/>

            them" : 1 similarly every man's freedom of speech requires <lb/>
            character behind it, and especially true is this in regard to <lb/>
            those who censure and correct others. Thus Plato said <lb/>
            that his life was a tacit rebuke to Speusippus : and doubt­ <lb/>
            less Xenocrates by his mere presence in the schools, and by <lb/>
            his earnest look at Polemo, made a changed man of him. <lb/>
            Whereas a man of levity and bad character, if he ventures <lb/>
            to rebuke anybody, is likely to hear the line, <lb/>
            " He doctors others, all diseased himself." a</p>
          <p>§ XXXIII. Yet since circumstances frequently call on <lb/>
            people who are bad themselves in association with other <lb/>
            such to reprove them, the most convenient mode of reproof <lb/>
            will be that which contrives to include the reprover in the <lb/>
            same indictment as the reproved, as in the case of the <lb/>
            line, <lb/>
            " Tydides, how on earth have we forgot <lb/>
            Our old impetuous courage ?” 3 <lb/>
            and, <lb/>
            " Now are we all not worth one single Hector." 4 <lb/>
            In this mild way did Socrates rebuke young men, as not <lb/>
            himself without ignorance, but one that needed in common <lb/>
            with them to prosecute virtue, and seek truth. For they <lb/>
            gain goodwill and influence, who seem to have the same <lb/>
            faults as their friends, and desire to correct themselves as <lb/>
            well as them. But he who is high and mighty in setting <lb/>
            down another, as if he were himself perfect and without <lb/>
            any imperfections, unless he be of a very advanced age, or <lb/>
            has an acknowledged reputation for virtue and worth, does <lb/>
            no good, but is only regarded as a tiresome bore. And so <lb/>
            it was wisely done of Phoenix to relate his own mishaps, <lb/>
            how he had meant killing his father, but quickly repented <lb/>
            at the thought " that he would be called by the Achæans <lb/>
            parricide," 5 that he might not seem to be rebuking <lb/>
            Achilles, as one that had himself never suffered from excess <lb/>
            of rage. For kindness of this sort has great influence, <note type="footnote"> 1 See our Author, “ Apophthegmata,”* p. 190 E. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 A line of Euripides, quoted again in " How a Man may be bene­ <lb/>

            and people yield more to those who seem to be sympa­ <lb/>
            thetic and not supercilious. And since we ought not to <lb/>
            expose an inflamed eye to a strong light, and a soul a prey <lb/>
            to the passions cannot bear unmixed reproof and rebuke, <lb/>
            one of the most useful remedies will be found to be a <lb/>
            slight mixture of praise, as in the following lines, <lb/>
            “ Ye will not sure give up your valiant courage, <lb/>
            The best men in the host! I should not care <lb/>
            If any coward left the fight, not I ; <lb/>
            But you to do so cuts me to the heart." 1 <lb/>
            And, <lb/>
            " Where is thy bow, where thy winged arrows, Pandarus, <lb/>
            Where thy great fame, which no one here can match ? ” 2 <lb/>
            Such language again plainly cheers very much those that <lb/>
            are down as, <lb/>
            “ Where now is (Edipus, and his famous riddles ? ” 3 <lb/>
            and, <lb/>
            “ Does much-enduring Hercules say this ? " 4 <lb/>
            For not only does it soften the harsh imperiousness of <lb/>
            censure, but also, by reminding a man of former noble <lb/>
            deeds, implants a desire to emulate his former self in <lb/>
            the person who is ashamed of what is low, and makes <lb/>
            himself his own exemplar for better things. But if we <lb/>
            make a comparison between him and other men, as his <lb/>
            contemporaries, his fellow-citizens, or his relations, then <lb/>
            the contentious spirit inherent in vice is vexed and ex­ <lb/>
            asperated, and is often apt to chime in angrily, " Why <lb/>
            don't you go off to my betters then, and leave off bother­ <lb/>
            ing me P " We must therefore be on our guard against <lb/>
            praising others, when we are rebuking a man, unless indeed <lb/>
            it be their parents, as Agamemnon says in Homer, <lb/>
            " Little like Tydeus is his father's son! ” 5 <lb/>
            or as Odysseus in the play called " The Scyrians,” 6 <lb/>
            " Dost thou card wool, and thus the lustre smirch <lb/>
            Of thy illustrious sire, thy noble race ?

            </p>
          <p>§ xxxiv. But it is by no means fitting when rebuked to <lb/>
            rebuke back, and when spoken to plainly to answer back, <lb/>
            for that soon kindles a flame and causes dissension; and <lb/>
            generally speaking such altercation will not look so much <lb/>
            like a retort as an inability to bear freedom of speech. It <lb/>
            is better therefore to listen patiently to a friend's rebuke, <lb/>
            for if he should afterwards do wrong himself and so need <lb/>
            rebuke, he has set you the example of freedom of speech. <lb/>
            For being reminded without any malice, that he himself <lb/>
            has not been accustomed to spare his friends when they <lb/>
            have done wrong, but to convince them and show them <lb/>
            their fault, he will be the more inclined to yield and give <lb/>
            himself up to correction, as it will seem a return of goodwill <lb/>
            and kindness rather than scolding or rage.</p>
          <p>§ xxxv. Moreover, as Thucydides says he is well advised <lb/>
            who [only] incurs envy in the most important matters," 1 <lb/>
            so the friend ought only to take upon himself the un­ <lb/>
            pleasant duty of reproof in grave and momentous cases. <lb/>
            For if he is always in a fret and a fume, and rates his <lb/>
            acquaintances more like a tutor than a friend, his rebuke <lb/>
            will be blunt and ineffective in cases of the highest im­ <lb/>
            portance, and he will resemble a doctor who dispenses <lb/>
            some sharp and bitter, but important and costly, drug in <lb/>
            trifling cases of common occurrence, where it was not at <lb/>
            all needed, and so will lose all the advantages that might <lb/>
            come from a judicious use of freedom of speech. He will <lb/>
            therefore be very much on his guard against continual <lb/>
            fault-finding, and if his friend is always pettifogging about <lb/>
            minute matters, and is needlessly querulous, it will give him <lb/>
            a handle against him in more important shortcomings. <lb/>
            Philotimus the doctor, when a patient who had abscesses <lb/>
            on his liver showed him his sore finger, said to him, " My <lb/>
            friend, it is not the whitlow that matters." 2 So an oppor­ <lb/>
            tunity sometimes offers itself to a friend to say to a man, <lb/>
            who is always finding fault on small and trivial points, <lb/>
            "Why are we always discussing mere child's play, tippling,3 <note type="footnote"> 1 Thucydides, ii. 64. Quoted again in " On Shyness," § xviii. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 See also " De Audiendo,” § x. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 <foreign xml:lang="grc">πότους</foreign> comes in rather curiously here. Can any other word lui k <lb/>

             <pb n="199"/>
            and trifles ? Let such a one, my dear sir, send away his <lb/>
            mistress, or give up playing at dice, he will then be in my <lb/>
            opinion in all respects an excellent fellow." For he who <lb/>
            receives pardon on small matters is content that his friend <lb/>
            should rebuke him on matters of more moment: but the <lb/>
            man who is ever on the scold, everywhere sour and glum, <lb/>
            knowing and prying into everything, is scarcely tolerable <lb/>
            to his children or brothers, and insufferable to his slaves.</p>
          <p>§ XXXVI. But since "neither," to use the words of Euri­ <lb/>
            pides, “ do all troubles proceed only from old age,”1 nor from <lb/>
            the stupidity of our friends, we ought to observe not only <lb/>
            the shortcomings but also the good points of our friends, aye, <lb/>
            by Zeus, and to be ready to praise them first, and only <lb/>
            censure them afterwards. For as iron receives its coil­ <lb/>
            sistency and temper by first being submitted to fire and so <lb/>
            made soft and then dipped into cold water, so when friends <lb/>
            have been first warmed and melted with praises we can <lb/>
            afterwards use gentle remonstrance, which has a similar <lb/>
            effect to that of dipping in the case of the metal. For <lb/>
            an opportunity will offer itself to say, " Are those actions <lb/>
            worthy to be compared with these ? Do you see what <lb/>
            fruits virtue yields ? These are the things we your friends <lb/>
            ask of you, these become you, for these you are designed <lb/>
            by nature; but all that other kind of conduct we must <lb/>
            reject with abhorrence, ' cast it away on a mountain, or <lb/>
            throw it into the roaring sea.' "2 For as a clever doctor <lb/>
            would prefer to cure the illness of his patient by sleep and <lb/>
            diet rather than by castor or scammony, so a kind friend <lb/>
            and good father or teacher delight to use praise rather <lb/>
            than blame to correct the character. For nothing makes <lb/>
            rebuke less painful or more beneficial than to refrain from <lb/>
            anger, and to inveigh against wrong-doing mildly and <lb/>
            kindly. And so we ought not sharply to drive home <lb/>
            the guilt of those who deny it, or prevent their making <lb/>
            their defence, but even contrive to furnish them with <lb/>
            specious excuses, and if they seem reluctant to give a bid <lb/>
            motive for their action we ought ourselves to find for them <lb/>
            a better, as Hector did for his brother Paris, <lb/>
            " Unhappy man, thy anger was not good," 3 <note type="footnote"> 1 " Phœnissæ,” 528, 529. 2 Homer," Iliad," vi. 347. 3 Do. vi. 326. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="200"/>
            suggesting that his absconding from the battle was not <lb/>
            running away or cowardice, but only anger. And Nestor <lb/>
            says to Agamemnon, <lb/>
            “ You only yielded to your lofty passion.”1 <lb/>
            For it has, I think, a better moral tendency to say "You <lb/>
            forgot," or “ Yon did it inadvertently," than to say “You <lb/>
            acted unfairly," or " You behaved shamefully :" as also <lb/>
            " Don't contend with your brother," than " Don't envy <lb/>
            your brother; " and “Avoid the woman who is your ruin," <lb/>
            than " Stop ruining the woman." Such is the language <lb/>
            employed in rebuke that desires to reform and not to <lb/>
            wound ; that rebuke which looks merely at the effect to be <lb/>
            produced acts on another principle. For when it is neces­ <lb/>
            sary to stop people on the verge of wrong-doing, or to <lb/>
            check some violent and irregular impulse, or if we wish to <lb/>
            rouse and infuse vigour in those who prosecute virtue only <lb/>
            feebly and languidly, we may then assign strange and un­ <lb/>
            becoming motives for their behaviour. As Odysseus in <lb/>
            Sophocles' play, striving to rouse Achilles, says he is not <lb/>
            angry about his supper,3 but " that he is afraid now that he <lb/>
            looks upon the walls of Troy," and when Achilles was vexed <lb/>
            at this, and talked of sailing home again, he said, <lb/>
            " I know what 'tis you shun : 'tis not ill fame : <lb/>
            But Hector's near, it is not safe to beard him.” <lb/>
            Thus by frightening the high-spirited and courageous man <lb/>
            by the imputation of cowardice, and the sober and orderly <lb/>
            man by that of licentiousness, and the liberal and munifi­ <lb/>
            cent man by that of meanness and avarice, people urge <lb/>
            them on to what is good, and deter them from what is <lb/>
            bad, showing moderation in cases past remedy, and exhibit­ <lb/>
            ing in their freedom of speech more sorrow and sympathy <lb/>
            than fault-finding ; but in the prevention of wrong-doing <lb/>
            and in earnest fighting against the passions they are vehe­ <lb/>
            ment and inexorable and assiduous: for that is the time <note type="footnote"> 1 Homer, "Iliad," ix. log, 110. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 In Dindorfs " Pœtæ Scenici Græci,” Fragment 152. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 As it is not quite clear why Achilles should have been angry about <lb/>

            that Plutarch may have written <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν τψ̃ Δείπνψ</foreign>. </note> <lb/>

            for downright plainness and truth. Besides we see that <lb/>
            enemies censure one another for what they have done <lb/>
            amiss, as Diogenes said,1 he who wished to lead a good <lb/>
            life ought to have good friends or red-hot enemies, for the <lb/>
            former told you what was right, and the latter blamed yon <lb/>
            if you did what was wrong. But it is better to be on our <lb/>
            guard against wrong actions, through listening to the per­ <lb/>
            suasion of those that advise us well, than to repent, after <lb/>
            we have done wrong, in consequence of the reproaches of <lb/>
            our enemies. And so we ought to employ tact in our free­ <lb/>
            dom of speech, as it is the greatest and most powerful <lb/>
            remedy in friendship, and always needs a well-chosen <lb/>
            occasion, and moderation in applying it.</p>
          <p>§ XXXVII. Since then, as I have said before, freedom of <lb/>
            speech is often painful to the person who is to receive <lb/>
            benefit from it, we must imitate the surgeons, who, when <lb/>
            they have performed an operation, do not leave the suffering <lb/>
            part to pain and smart, but bathe and foment it; so those <lb/>
            who do their rebuking daintily run2 off after paining and <lb/>
            smarting, and by different dealing and kind words soothe <lb/>
            and mollify them, as statuaries smooth and polish images <lb/>
            which have been broken or chipped. But he that is broken <lb/>
            and wounded by rebuke, if he is left sullen and swelling <lb/>
            with rage and off his equilibrium, is henceforth hard to win <lb/>
            back or talk over. And so people who reprove ought to be <lb/>
            especially careful on this point, and not to leave them too <lb/>
            soon, nor break off their conversation and intercourse with <lb/>
            their acquaintances at the exasperating and painful stage.</p>

          <p>§ I. I am well aware, Cornelius Pulcher, that you prefer <lb/>
            the mildest manners in public life, by which you can be at <lb/>
            once most useful to the community, and most agreeable in <note type="footnote"> 1 Compare " How One may be aware of one's Progress in Virtue,” § xi. </note><note type="footnote">2 44 Ductum e proverbiali dictione (<foreign xml:lang="grc">βαλόντα ἐκφεύγειν</foreign>, emisso telo <lb/>

            private life to those who have any dealings with you. But <lb/>
            since it is difficult to find any region without wild beasts, <lb/>
            though it is related of Crete ;1 and hitherto there has been <lb/>
            no state that has not suffered from envy, rivalry, and strife, <lb/>
            the most fruitful seeds of hostility; (for, even if nothing <lb/>
            else does, our friendships involve us in enmities, as Chilo2 <lb/>
            the wise man perceived, who asked the man who told him <lb/>
            he had no enemy, whether he had a friend either), it seems <lb/>
            to me that a public man ought not only to examine the <lb/>
            whole question of enemies in its various ramifications, but <lb/>
            also to listen to the serious remark of Xenophon,3 that a <lb/>
            sensible man will receive profit even from his enemies. <lb/>
            The ideas therefore that lately occurred to me to deliver, I <lb/>
            have now put together nearly in the identical words and <lb/>
            send them to you, with the exception of some matter also <lb/>
            in " Political Precepts,”4 a treatise which I have often <lb/>
            noticed in your hands.</p>
          <p>§ 11. People in old times were well satisfied if they were <lb/>
            not injured by strange and wild beasts, and that was the <lb/>
            only motive of their fights with them, but those of later <lb/>
            days have by now learnt to make use of them, for they feed <lb/>
            on their flesh, and clothe themselves with their wool, and <lb/>
            make medical use of their gall and beestings, and turn <lb/>
            their hides into shields, so that we might reasonably fear, <lb/>
            if beasts failed man, that his life would become brutish, <lb/>
            and wild, and void of resources. Similarly since all others <lb/>
            are satisfied with not being injured by their enemies, but <lb/>
            the sensible will also (as Xenophon says) get profit out of <lb/>
            them, we must not be incredulous, but seek a method and <lb/>
            plan how to obtain this advantage, seeing that life without <lb/>
            an enemy is impossible. The husbandman cannot cultivate <lb/>
            every tree, nor can the hunter tame every kind of animal, <lb/>
            so both seek means to derive profit according to their <lb/>
            several necessities, the one from his barren trees, the other <lb/>
            from his wild animals. Sea-water also is undrinkable and <lb/>
            brackish, but it feeds fish, and is a sort of vehicle to convey <lb/>
            and transport travellers anywhere. The Satyr, when he <note type="footnote"> 1 So Pliny, viii. 83 : “ In Creta Insula non vulpes ursive, atque <lb/>

            saw fire for the first time, wished to kiss it and embrace it, <lb/>
            but Prometheus warned him, <lb/>
            " Goat, thou wilt surely mourn thy loss of beard.” 1 <lb/>
            For fire burns whoever touches it, but it also gives light and <lb/>
            warmth, and is an instrument of art to all those who know <lb/>
            how to use it.2 Consider also in the case of the enemy, if <lb/>
            he is in other respects injurious and intractable, he some­ <lb/>
            how or other gives us a handle to make use of him by, and <lb/>
            so is serviceable. And many things are unpleasant and <lb/>
            detestable and antagonistic to those to whom they happen, <lb/>
            but you must have noticed that some use even illnesses as a <lb/>
            period of rest for the body, and others by excessive toil <lb/>
            have strengthened and trained their bodily vigour, and <lb/>
            some have made exile and the loss of money a passage to <lb/>
            leisure and philosophy, as did Diogenes and Crates. And <lb/>
            Zeno, when he heard of the wreck of the ship which con­ <lb/>
            tained all his property, said, " Thou hast done well, Fortune, <lb/>
            to confine me to my threadbare cloak.” 3</p>
          <p>For as those animals that have the strongest and healthiest <lb/>
            stomachs eat and digest serpents and scorpions, and some <lb/>
            even feed on stones and shells, which they convert into <lb/>
            nourishment by the strength and heat of their stomachs, <lb/>
            while fastidious people out of health almost vomit if offered <lb/>
            bread and wine, so foolish people spoil even their friend­ <lb/>
            ships, while the wise know how to turn to account even <lb/>
            their enmities.</p>
          <p>§ III. In the first place then it seems to me that what is <lb/>
            most injurious in enmity may become most useful to those <lb/>
            that pay attention to it ? To what do I refer p Why, to <lb/>
            the way in which your enemy ever wide awake pries into <lb/>
            all your affairs, and analyzes your whole life, trying to get <lb/>
            a handle against you somewhere, able not only to look <lb/>
            through a tree, like Lynceus,4 or through stones and shells, <note type="footnote"> 1 A line from a lost Satyric Play of Æschylus, called “ Prometheus <lb/>

            but through your friend and domestic and every intimate <lb/>
            acquaintance, as far as possible detecting your doings, <lb/>
            and digging and ferreting into your designs. For our <lb/>
            friends are ill and often die without our knowing anything <lb/>
            about it through our delay and carelessness, but we almost <lb/>
            pry into even the dreams of our enemies ; and our enemy <lb/>
            knows even more than we do ourselves of our diseases and <lb/>
            debts and differences with our wives.1 But they pay most <lb/>
            attention to our faults and hunt them out: and as vultures <lb/>
            follow the scent of putrid carcases, and cannot perceive <lb/>
            sound and wholesome ones, so the diseases and vices and <lb/>
            crimes of life attract the enemy, and on these those that <lb/>
            hate us pounce, these they attack and tear to pieces. Is <lb/>
            not this an advantage to us P Certainly it is. For it teaches <lb/>
            us to live warily and be on our guard, and neither to do or <lb/>
            say anything carelessly or without circumspection, but ever <lb/>
            to be vigilant by careful mode of living that we give no <lb/>
            handle to an enemy. For the cautiousness that thus <lb/>
            represses the passions and follows reason implants a care <lb/>
            and determination to live well and without reproach. For <lb/>
            as those states that have been sobered by wars with their <lb/>
            neighbours and continual campaigns love the blessings of <lb/>
            order and peace, so those people who are compelled to lead <lb/>
            a sober life owing to their enemies, and to be on their <lb/>
            guard against carelessness and negligence, and to do every­ <lb/>
            thing with an eye to utility, imperceptibly glide into a fault­ <lb/>
            less mode of life, and tone down their character, even without <lb/>
            requiring much assistance from precepts. For those who <lb/>
            always remember the line, <lb/>
            " Ah ! how would Priam and his sons rejoice,“2 <lb/>
            are by it diverted from and learn to shun all such things <lb/>
            as their enemies would rejoice and laugh at. Again we <lb/>
            see actors3 and singers on the stage oftentimes slack and <lb/>
            remiss, and not taking sufficient pains about their per­ <lb/>
            formances in the theatres when they have it all to them­ <lb/>
            selves ; but when there is a competition and contest with <note type="footnote"> 1 See Plautus, " Trinummus," 205-211. a Homer, " Iliad," i. 255. </note><note type="footnote"> 8 Literally " the artists of Dionysus.” We know what they were from <lb/>

            others, they not only wake up but tune their instruments, <lb/>
            and adjust their chords, and play on the flute with more <lb/>
            care. Similarly whoever knows that his enemy is an­ <lb/>
            tagonistic to his life and character, pays more attention to <lb/>
            himself, and watches his behaviour more carefully, and <lb/>
            regulates his life. For it is peculiar to vice to be more <lb/>
            afraid of enemies than friends in regard to our faults. And <lb/>
            so Nasica, when some expressed their opinion that the <lb/>
            Roman Republic was now secure, since Carthage was rased, <lb/>
            to the ground and Achaia reduced to slavery, said, " Nay <lb/>
            rather we are now in a critical position, since we have none <lb/>
            left to fear or respect."</p>
          <p>§ IV. Consider also that very philosophical and witty <lb/>
            answer of Diogenes to the man who asked, " How shall I <lb/>
            avenge myself on my enemy? ” " By becoming a good <lb/>
            and honest man." 1 Some people are terribly put about <lb/>
            if they see their enemies' horses in a good condition, or <lb/>
            hear their dogs praised; if they see their farm well-tilled, <lb/>
            their garden well-kept, they groan aloud. What a state <lb/>
            think you then they would be in, if you were to exhibit <lb/>
            yourself as a just man, sensible and good, in words excel­ <lb/>
            lent, in deeds pure, in manner of life decorous, " reap­ <lb/>
            ing fruit from the deep soil of the soul, where good <lb/>
            counsels grow." 2 Pindar says 3 " those that are conquered <lb/>

            all men, only those that see they are outdone by their <lb/>
            enemies in industry, in goodness, in magnanimity, in <lb/>
            humanity, in kindnesses; these, as Demosthenes says, " stop <lb/>
            the tongue, block up the mouth, choke people, and make <lb/>

            If you wish to vex the man who hates you, do not abuse <lb/>
            him by calling him a pathick, or effeminate, or intemperate, <lb/>

            dealings with those you come across. But if yon are <lb/>
            tempted to use abuse, mind that you yourself are very far <lb/>
            from what you abuse him for, dive down into your own <lb/>
            soul, look for any rottenness in yourself, lest someone <lb/>
            suggest to you the line of the tragedian, <lb/>
            "You doctor others, all diseased yourself.” 1 <lb/>
            If you say your enemy is uneducated, increase your own <lb/>
            love of learning and industry ; if you call him coward, stir <lb/>
            up the more your own spirit and manliness; and if you <lb/>
            say he is wanton and licentious, erase from your own soul <lb/>
            any secret trace of the love of pleasure. For nothing is <lb/>
            more disgraceful or more unpleasant than slander that <lb/>
            recoils on the person who sets it in motion; for as the <lb/>
            reflection of light seems most to injure weak eyes, so does <lb/>
            censure when it recoils on the censurer, and is borne out <lb/>
            by the facts. For as the north-east wind attracts clouds, so <lb/>
            does a bad life draw upon itself rebukes.</p>
          <p>§ v. Whenever Plato was in company with people who <lb/>
            behaved in an unseemly manner, he used to say to himself, <lb/>
            " Am I such a person as this ? ”2 So he that censures <lb/>
            another man's life, if he straightway examines and mends <lb/>
            his own, directing and turning it into the contrary direc­ <lb/>
            tion, will get some advantage from his censure, which will <lb/>
            be otherwise idle and unprofitable. Most people laugh if <lb/>
            a bald-pate or hump-back jeer and mock at others who are <lb/>
            so too: it is quite as ridiculous to jeer and mock if one lies <lb/>
            open to retort oneself, as Leo of Byzantium showed in his <lb/>
            answer to the hump-back who jeered at him for weakness <lb/>
            of eyes, " You twit me with an infirmity natural to man, <lb/>
            while you yourself carry your Nemesis on your back.” 3 <lb/>
            And so do not abuse another as an adulterer, if you yourself <lb/>
            are mad after boys : nor as a spendthrift, if you yourself <lb/>
            are niggardly. Alcmæon said to Adrastus, " You are <lb/>
            near kinsman to a woman that slew her husband." What <note type="footnote"> 1 A line from Euripides. Quoted also “ De Adulatore et Amico," <lb/>

            was his reply ? He retaliated on him with the appropriate <lb/>
            retort, " But yon killed with your own. hand the mother <lb/>
            that bare you." 1 And Domitius said to Crassus, " Did <lb/>
            you not weep for the lamprey that was bred in your fish­ <lb/>
            pond, and died ? ” To which Crassus replied, " Did you <lb/>
            weep, when you buried your three wives ?" He therefore <lb/>
            that intends to abuse others must not be witty and noisy <lb/>
            and impudent, but a man that does not lie open to counter- <lb/>
            abuse and retort, for the god seems to have enjoined upon <lb/>
            no one the precept " Know thyself " so much as on the person <lb/>
            who is censorious, to prevent people saying 'just what they <lb/>
            please, and hearing what don't please them. For such a <lb/>
            one is wont, as Sophocles' says, " idly letting his tongue <lb/>
            flow, to hear against his will, what he willingly says ill of <lb/>
            others. ”</p>
          <p>§ vi. This use and advantage then there is in abusing <lb/>
            one's enemy, and no less arises from being abused and ill- <lb/>
            spoken of oneself by one's enemies. And so Antisthenes' <lb/>
            said well that those who wish to lead a good life ought to <lb/>
            have genuine friends or red-hot enemies; for the former <lb/>
            deterred you from what was wrong by reproof, the latter <lb/>
            by abuse. But since friendship has nowadays become <lb/>
            very mealy-mouthed in freedom of speech, voluble in <lb/>
            flattery and silent in rebuke, we can only hear the truth <lb/>
            from our enemies. For as Telephus4 having no surgeon of <lb/>
            his own, submitted his wound to be cured by his enemy's <lb/>
            spear, so those who cannot procure friendly rebuke <lb/>
            must content themselves with the censure of an enemy that <lb/>
            hates them, reprehending and castigating their vices, and <lb/>
            regard not the animus of the person, but only his matter. <lb/>
            For as he who intended to kill the Thessalian Prometheus5 <note type="footnote"> 1 From a lost play of Euripides. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 In some lost play. Compare Hesiod, “ Works and Days," 719-721; <lb/>

            only stabbed a tumour, and so lanced it that the man's <lb/>
            life was saved, and he was rid of the tumour by its bursting, <lb/>
            so oftentimes abuse, suddenly thrust on a man in anger or <lb/>
            hatred, has cured some disease in his soul which he was <lb/>
            ignorant of or neglected. But most people when they are. <lb/>
            abused do not consider whether the abuse really belongs to <lb/>
            them properly, but look round to see what abuse they can <lb/>
            heap on the abuser, and, as wrestlers get smothered with <lb/>
            the dust of the arena, do not wipe off the abuse hurled at <lb/>
            themselves, but bespatter others, and at last get on both <lb/>
            sides grimy and discoloured. But if anyone gets a bad <lb/>
            name from an enemy, he ought to clear himself of the im­ <lb/>
            putation even more than he would remove any stain on his <lb/>
            clothes that was pointed out to him; and if it be wholly <lb/>
            untrue, yet he ought to investigate what originated the <lb/>
            charge, and to be on his guard and be afraid lest he had <lb/>
            unawares done something very near akin to what was im­ <lb/>
            puted to him. As Lacydes, the king of the Argives, by <lb/>
            the way he wore his hair and by his mincing walk got <lb/>
            charged with effeminacy: and Pompey's scratching his <lb/>
            head with one finger was construed in the same way, though <lb/>
            both these men were very far from effeminacy or wanton­ <lb/>
            ness. And Crassus was accused of an intrigue with one <lb/>
            of the Vestal Virgins, because he wished to purchase from <lb/>
            her a pleasant estate, and therefore frequently visited her <lb/>
            and waited upon her. And Postumia, from her readiness <lb/>
            to laugh and talk somewhat freely with men, got accused <lb/>
            and even had to stand her trial for incest,1 but was, how­ <lb/>
            ever, acquitted of that charge: but Spurius Minucius the <lb/>
            Pontifex Maximus, when he pronounced her innocent, urged <lb/>
            her not to be freer in her words than she was in her life. <lb/>
            And though Themistocles2 was guiltless of treason, his <lb/>
            intimacy with Pausanias, and the letters and messages that <lb/>
            frequently passed between them, laid him under suspicion.</p>
          <p>§ VII. Whenever therefore any false charge is made <lb/>
            against us, we ought not merely to despise and neglect it <lb/>
            as false, but to see what word or action, either in jest or <lb/>
            earnest, has made the charge seem probable, and this we <note type="footnote"> 1 She was a Vestal Virgin. See Livy, iv. 44. </note><note type="footnote">2 See Thucydides, i. 135, 136. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="209"/>
            must for the future be earnestly on our guard against and <lb/>
            shun. For if others falling into unforeseen trouble and <lb/>
            difficulties teach us what is expedient, as Merope says, <lb/>
            “ Fortune has made me wise, though she has ta'en <lb/>
            My dearest ones as wages," 1 <lb/>
            why should we not take an enemy, and pay him no wages, <lb/>
            to teach us, and give us profit and instruction, in matters <lb/>
            which had escaped our notice ? For an enemy has keener <lb/>
            perception than a friend, for, as Plato 2 says, " the lover is <lb/>
            blind as respects the loved one," and hatred is both curious <lb/>
            and talkative. Hiero was twitted by one of his enemies <lb/>
            for his foul breath, so he went home and said to his wife, <lb/>
            " How is this ? You never told me of it." But she being <lb/>
            chaste and innocent replied, " I thought all men's breath <lb/>
            was like that." 3 Thus perceptible and material things, <lb/>
            and things that are plain to everybody, are sooner learnt <lb/>
            from enemies than from friends and intimates.</p>
          <p>§ VIII. Moreover to keep the tongue well under control, <lb/>
            no small factor in moral excellence, and to make it always <lb/>
            obedient and submissive to reason, is not possible, unless <lb/>
            by practice and attention and painstaking a man has sub­ <lb/>
            dued his worst passions, as for example anger. For such ex­ <lb/>
            pressions as “ a word uttered involuntarily," and "escaping <lb/>
            the barrier of the teeth,” 4 and " words darting forth spon­ <lb/>
            taneously," well illustrate what happens in the case of ill­ <lb/>
            disciplined souls, ever wavering and in an unsettled con­ <lb/>
            dition through infirmity of temper, through unbridled fancy, <lb/>
            or through faulty education. But, according to divine Plato,5 <lb/>
            though a word seems a very trivial matter, the heaviest <lb/>
            penalty follows upon it both from gods and men. But <lb/>
            silence can never be called to account, is not only not <lb/>
            thirsty, to borrow the language of Hippocrates, but when <lb/>
            abused is dignified and Socratic, or rather Herculean, if <lb/>
            indeed it was Hercules who said, <lb/>
            " Sharp words he heeded not so much as flies." 6 <note type="footnote"> 1 From a lost play of Euripides. Compare the proverb, <foreign xml:lang="grc">παθήματα <lb/>

            Not more dignified and noble than this is it to keep silent <lb/>
            when an enemy reviles you, " as one swims by a smooth <lb/>
            and mocking cliff," but in practice it is better. If you <lb/>
            accustom yourself to bear silently the abuse of an enemy, <lb/>
            you will very easily bear the attack of a scolding wife, and <lb/>
            will remain undisturbed when you hear the sharp language <lb/>
            of a friend or brother, and will be calm and placid when <lb/>
            you are beaten or have something thrown at your head by <lb/>
            your father or mother. For Socrates put up with Xan­ <lb/>
            thippe, a passionate and froward woman, which made him <lb/>
            a more easy companion with others, as being accustomed to <lb/>
            submit to her caprices ; and it is far better to train and <lb/>
            accustom the temper to bear quietly the insults and rages <lb/>
            and jeers and taunts of enemies and estranged persons, and <lb/>
            not to be distressed at it.</p>
          <p>§ ix. Thus then must we exhibit in our enmities meek­ <lb/>
            ness and forbearance, and in our friendships still more sim­ <lb/>
            plicity and magnanimity and kindness. For it is not so <lb/>
            graceful to do a friend a service, as disgraceful to refuse to <lb/>
            do so at his request; and not to revenge oneself on an <lb/>
            enemy when opportunity offers is generous. But the man <lb/>
            who sympathizes with his enemy in affliction, and assists <lb/>
            him in distress, and readily holds out a helping hand to his <lb/>
            children and family and their fortunes when in a low con­ <lb/>
            dition, whoever does not admire such a man for his humanity, <lb/>
            and praise his benevolence, <lb/>
            " He has a black heart made of adamant <lb/>
            Or iron or bronze." 1 <lb/>
            When Cæsar ordered the statues of Pompey that had been <lb/>
            thrown down to be put up again,2 Cicero said, " You have <lb/>
            set up again Pompey's statues, and in so doing have erected <lb/>
            statues to yourself." We ought not therefore to be <lb/>
            niggardly in our praise and honour of an enemy that <lb/>
            deserves a good name. For he who praises another receives <lb/>
            on that account greater praise himself, and is the more <lb/>
            credited on another occasion when he finds fault, as not <lb/>
            having any personal ill-feeling against the man, but only <note type="footnote"> 1 From a Fragment of Pindar. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 See Suetonius, " Divus Julius," 75: " Sed et statuas L. Sullæ atque <lb/>

             <pb n="211"/>
            disapproving of his act; and what is most noble and <lb/>
            advantageous, the man who is accustomed to praise his <lb/>
            enemies, and not to be vexed or malignant at their pros­ <lb/>
            perity, is as far as possible from envying the good fortune <lb/>
            of his friends, and the success of his intimates. And yet <lb/>
            what practice will be more beneficial to our minds, or bring <lb/>
            about a happier disposition, than that which banishes from <lb/>
            us all jealousy and envy ? For as in war many necessary <lb/>
            things, otherwise bad, are customary and have as it were <lb/>
            the sanction of law, so that they cannot be abolished in <lb/>
            spite of the injury they do, so enmity drags along in its <lb/>
            train hatred, and envy, and jealousy, and malignity, and <lb/>
            revenge, and stamps them on the character. Moreover <lb/>
            knavery, and deceit, and villainy, that seem neither bad nor <lb/>
            unfair if employed against an enemy, if they once get <lb/>
            planted in the mind are difficult to dislodge; and even­ <lb/>
            tually from force of habit get used also against friends, <lb/>
            unless they are forewarned and forearmed through their <lb/>
            previous acquaintance with the tricks of enemies. If then <lb/>
            Pythagoras, 1 accustoming his disciples to abstain from all <lb/>
            cruelty and inhumanity to the brute creation, did right to <lb/>
            discountenance bird-fowling, and to buy up draughts of <lb/>
            fishes and bid them be thrown into the water again, and to <lb/>
            forbid killing any but wild animals, much more noble is it, <lb/>
            in dissensions and differences with human beings, to be a <lb/>
            generous, just and true enemy, and to check and tame all <lb/>
            bad and low and knavish propensities, that in all inter­ <lb/>
            course with friends a man may keep the peace and abstain <lb/>
            from doing an injury. Scaurus was an enemy and accuser <lb/>
            of Domitius, but when one of Domitius' slaves came to him <lb/>
            to reveal some important matters which were unknown to <lb/>
            Scaurus, be would not hear him, but seized him and sent <lb/>
            him back to his master. And when Cato was prosecuting <lb/>
            Murena for canvassing, and was getting together his <lb/>
            evidence, he was accompanied as was usual by people who <lb/>
            watched what he was doing,2 and would often ask him if he <lb/>
            intended that day to get together his witnesses and open <lb/>
            the case, and if he said " No," they believed him and went <note type="footnote"> 1 Compare our author, " Quaestiones Convivalium," viii. p. 729 E. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 No doubt in the interest of the defendant. See our author, " Cato <lb/>

            their way. All this is the greatest proof of the credit <lb/>
            which was reposed in Cato, but it is better and more im­ <lb/>
            portant, that we should accustom ourselves to deal justly <lb/>
            even with our enemies, and then there will be no fear that <lb/>
            we should ever act unjustly and treacherously to our friends <lb/>
            and intimates.</p>
          <p>§ x. But since, as Simonides says, " all larks must have <lb/>
            their crests,” 1 and every man'snature contains in it pugnacity <lb/>
            and jealousy and envy, which last is, as Pindar says, " the <lb/>
            companion of empty-headed men," one might get consider­ <lb/>
            able advantage by purging oneself of those passions against <lb/>
            enemies, and by diverting them, like sewers, as far as <lb/>
            possible from companions and friends.2 And this it seems <lb/>
            the statesmanlike Onomademus had remarked, for being <lb/>
            on the victorious side in a disturbance at Chios, he urged <lb/>
            his party not to expel all of the different faction, but to <lb/>
            leave some, " in order," he said, " that we may not begin <lb/>
            to quarrel with our friends, when we have got entirely rid <lb/>
            of our enemies." So too our expending these passions <lb/>
            entirely on our enemies will give less trouble to our friends. <lb/>
            For it ought not to be, as Hesiod3 says, that " potter envies <lb/>
            potter, and singer envies singer, and neighbour neighbour," <lb/>
            and cousin cousin, and brother brother, "if hastening to get <lb/>
            rich " and enjoying prosperity. But if there is no other <lb/>
            way to get rid of strife and envy and quarrels, accustom <lb/>
            yourself to be vexed at your enemies' good fortune, and <lb/>
            sharpen and accentuate on them your acerbity. For as <lb/>
            judicious gardeners think they produce finer roses and <lb/>
            violets by planting alongside of them garlic and onions, <lb/>
            that any bitter or strong elements may be transferred to <lb/>
            them, so your enemy's getting and attracting your envy <lb/>
            and malignity will render you kinder and more agreeable <lb/>
            to your prosperous friends. And so let us be rivals of our <lb/>
            enemies for glory or office or righteous gain, not only being <lb/>
            vexed if they get ahead of us, but also carefully observing <lb/>
            all the steps by which they get ahead, and trying to outdo <note type="footnote"> 1 A Greek proverb, see Erasmus, " Adagia," p. 921. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 So Cicero, " Nat. Deor." ii. 56 : “ In ædibus architecti avertunt ab <lb/>

            lation he sinks into envy and despondency, makes his life <lb/>
            become idle and inoperative. But he who is not blinded by <lb/>
            hate,2 but a discerning spectator of life and character and <lb/>
            words and deeds, will perceive that most of what he envies <lb/>
            comes to those who have them from diligence and prudence <lb/>
            and good actions, and exerting himself in the same direction <lb/>

            and will eradicate his vanity and sloth.</p>
          <p>§ xi. But if our enemies seem to us to have got either by <lb/>
            flattery, or fraud, or bribery, or venal services, in-got and <lb/>
            discreditable power at court or in state, it ought not to <lb/>
            trouble us but rather inspire pleasure in us, when we <lb/>
            compare our own liberty and purity and independence of <lb/>
            life. For, as Plato 3 says, " all the gold above or below the <lb/>
            earth is not of equal value with virtue." And we ought <lb/>
            ever to remember the precept of Solon, " We will not <lb/>
            exchange our virtue for others' wealth.” 4 Nor will we <lb/>
            give up our virtue for the applause of banqueting theatres, <lb/>
            nor for honours and chief seats among eunuchs and harlots, <lb/>
            nor to be monarchs’ satraps; for nothing is to be desired <lb/>
            or noble that comes from what is bad. But since, as Plato 5 <lb/>
            says, " the lover is blind as respects the loved one," and <lb/>
            we notice more what our enemies do amiss, we ought not <lb/>
            to let either our joy at their faults or our grief at their <lb/>
            success be idle, but in either case we ought to reflect, how <lb/>
            we may become better than them by avoiding their errors, <lb/>
            and by imitating their virtues not come short of them. <note type="footnote"> 1 Compare "How One may be aware of one's Progress in Virtue," <lb/>

            <title type="sub">ON TALKATIVENESS.1</title>
          </ab>
          <p>§ I. Philosophy finds talkativeness a disease very difficult <lb/>
            and hard to cure. For its remedy, conversation, requires <lb/>
            hearers : but talkative people hear nobody, for they are <lb/>
            ever prating. And the first evil this inability to keep <lb/>
            silence produces is an inability to listen. It is a self-chosen <lb/>
            deafness of people who, I take it, blame nature for giving <lb/>
            us one tongue and two ears. If then the following advice <lb/>
            of Euripides to a foolish hearer was good, <lb/>
            " I cannot fill one that can nought retain, <lb/>
            Pumping up wise words for an unwise man ; ” <lb/>
            one might more justly say to a talkative man, or rather <lb/>
            about a talkative man, <lb/>
            " I cannot fill one that will nothing take, <lb/>
            Pumping up wise words for an unwise man ; ” <lb/>
            or rather deluging with words one that talks to those who <lb/>
            don't listen, and listens not to those who talk. Even if <lb/>
            he does listen for a short time, talkativeness hurries off <lb/>
            what is said like the retiring sea, and anon brings it up <lb/>
            again multiplied with the approaching tide. The portico <lb/>
            at Olympia that returns many echoes to one utterance is <lb/>
            called seven-voiced,2 and if the slightest utterance catches <lb/>
            the ear of talkativeness, it at once echoes it all round, <lb/>
            “ Moving the mind's chords all unmoved before." 3 <lb/>
            For their ears can certainly have no passages leading to the <lb/>
            brain but only to the tongue. And so while other people <lb/>
            retain what they hear, talkative people lose it altogether, <lb/>
            and, being empty-headed, they resemble empty vessels, and <lb/>
            go about making much noise.4 <note type="footnote"> 1 Or Garrulity, Chattering, Prating. It is Talkativeness in a bad <lb/>
            sense. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Or Heptaphonos. See Pausanias, v. 21. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Some unknown poet's words. I suppose they mean driving one <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>§ IT. If however it seems that no attempt at cure has <lb/>
            been left untried, let -as say to the talkative person, <lb/>
            “ Be silent, boy; silence has great advantages 5" <lb/>
            two of the first and foremost of which are hearing and <lb/>
            being heard, neither of which can happen to talkative <lb/>
            people, for however they desire either so unhappy are they <lb/>
            that they must desist from it. For in all other diseases of <lb/>
            the soul, as love of money, love of glory, or love of pleasure, <lb/>
            people at any rate attain the desired object: but it is the <lb/>
            cruel fate of talkative people to desire hearers but not to <lb/>
            get them, for everyone flees from them with headlong <lb/>
            speed ; and if people are sitting or walking about in any <lb/>
            public place,1 and see one coming they quickly pass the <lb/>
            word to one another to shift quarters. And as when there <lb/>
            is dead silence in any assembly they say Hermes has joined <lb/>
            the company, so when any prater joins some drinking <lb/>
            party or social gathering of friends, all are silent, not <lb/>
            wishing to give him a chance to break in, and if he un­ <lb/>
            invited begin to open his mouth, they all, " like before a <lb/>
            storm at sea, when Boreas is blowing a gale round some <lb/>
            headland," foreseeing tossing about and nausea, disperse. <lb/>
            And so it is their destiny to find neither willing table- <lb/>
            companions, nor messmates when they are travelling by <lb/>
            land or by sea, but only such as cannot help themselves; <lb/>
            for such a fellow is always at you, plucking hold of your <lb/>
            clothes or chin, or giving you a dig in the ribs with his <lb/>
            elbow. "Most valuable are the feet in such a conjuncture," <lb/>
            according to Archilochus, nay according to the wise Aris­ <lb/>
            totle himself. For he being bothered with a talkative <lb/>
            fellow, and wearied out with his absurd tales, and his <lb/>
            frequent question, " Is not this wonderful, Aristotle ? " <lb/>
            " Not at all," said be, " but it is wonderful that anyone <lb/>
            with a pair of legs stops here to listen to you." And to <lb/>
            another such fellow, who said after a long rigmarole, " Did <lb/>
            I weary you, philosopher, by my chatter ? " " Not you, by <lb/>
            Zeus," said he, " for I paid no attention to you." For <note type="footnote"> 1 Literally in a semi-circular place. It is not quite clear whether the <lb/>

             <pb n="216"/>
            even if talkative people force you to listen,l the mind can <lb/>
            give them only its outward ears to deluge, while it unfolds <lb/>
            and pursues some other thoughts within; so they find <lb/>
            neither hearers to attend to them, nor credit them. They <lb/>
            say those that are prone to Venus are commonly barren: <lb/>
            so the prating of talkative people is ineffectual and fruit­ <lb/>
            less.</p>
          <p>§ in. And yet nature has fenced and barricaded in us <lb/>
            nothing so much as the tongue, having put the teeth <lb/>
            before it as a barrier, so that if, when reason holds tight <lb/>
            her " glossy reins,”2 it hearken not, nor keep within <lb/>
            bounds, we may check its intemperance, biting it till the <lb/>
            blood comes. For Euripides tells us that, not from un­ <lb/>
            bolted houses or store-rooms, but " from unbridled mouths <lb/>
            the end is misfortune."3 But those persons who think <lb/>
            that houses without doors and open purses are no good to <lb/>
            their possessors, and yet keep their mouths open and un­ <lb/>
            shut, and allow their speech to flow continually like the <lb/>
            waves of the Euxine,4 seem to regard speech as of less value <lb/>
            than anything. And so they never get believed, though <lb/>
            credit is the aim of every speech ; for to inspire belief in <lb/>
            one's hearers is the proper end of speech, but praters are <lb/>
            disbelieved even when they tell the truth. For as corn <lb/>
            stowed away in a granary is found to be larger in quantity <lb/>
            but inferior in quality, so the speech of a talkative man is <lb/>
            increased by a large addition of falsehood, which destroys <lb/>
            his credit.</p>
          <p>§ iv. Then again every man of modesty and propriety <lb/>
            would avoid drunkenness, for anger is next door neighbour <lb/>
            to madness as some think,5 but drunkenness lives in the <lb/>
            same house : or rather drunkenness is madness, more <lb/>
            short-lived indeed, but more potent also through voli-. <lb/>
            tion, for it is self-chosen. Nor is drunkenness censured <lb/>
            for anything so much as its intemperate and endless <lb/>
            talk. <note type="footnote"> 1 Reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀκούειν</foreign>, which seems far the best reading. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Homer, " Iliad," v. 226 ; “ Odyssey," vi. 81. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 “ Bacchæ,” 385-387. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 See Ovid, " Tristia," iv. 4, 55-58. </note><note type="footnote"> 5 For example, Horace, "Epistles," i. 2. 62: "Ira furor brevis est " <lb/>

            « “ Wine makes a prudent man begin to sing, <lb/>
            And gently laugh, and even makes him dance.”1 <lb/>
            And yet there is no harm in all this, in singing and laugh­ <lb/>
            ing and dancing. But the poet adds­ <lb/>
            " And it compels to say what's best unsaid."2 <lb/>
            This is indeed dreadful and dangerous. And perhaps the <lb/>
            poet in this passage has solved that problem of the philo­ <lb/>
            sophers, and stated the difference between being under the <lb/>
            influence of wine and being drunk, mirth being the condition <lb/>
            of the former, foolish talk of the latter. For as the proverb <lb/>
            tells us, " What is in the heart of the sober is on the <lb/>
            tongue of the drunken."3 And so Bias, being silent at a <lb/>
            drinking bout, and jeered at by some young man in the <lb/>
            company as stupid, replied, " What fool could hold his <lb/>
            tongue in liquor ? " And at Athens a certain person gave <lb/>
            an entertainment to the king's ambassadors, and at their <lb/>
            desire contrived to get the philosophers there too, and as <lb/>
            they were all talking together and comparing ideas, and <lb/>
            Zeno alone was silent, the strangers greeted him and <lb/>
            pledged him, and said, " What are we to tell the king <lb/>
            about you, Zeno ? " And he replied, 4 “Nothing, but that <lb/>
            there is an old man at Athens that can hold his tongue at <lb/>
            a drinking bout." So profound and mysterious and sober <lb/>
            is silence, while drunkenness is talkative : for it is void of <lb/>
            sense and understanding, and so is loquacious. And so <lb/>
            the philosophers define drunkenness to be silly talk in wine. <lb/>
            Drinking therefore is not censured, if silence go with it, <lb/>
            but foolish prating turns being under the influence of wine <lb/>
            into drunkenness. And the drunken man prates only in <lb/>
            his cups ; but the talkative man prates everywhere, in the <lb/>
            market-place, in the theatre, out walking, by night and by <lb/>
            day. If he is your doctor, he is more trouble to you than <lb/>
            your disease : if he is on board ship with you, he disgusts <lb/>
            you more than sea-sickness; if he praises you, be is more <lb/>
            fulsome than blame. It is more pleasure associating with <lb/>
            bad men who have tact than with good men who prate. <note type="footnote"> 1 Homer, “ Odyssey," xiv. 463-465.</note> <note type="footnote">2 Ibid. 466. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Compare the German proverb, " Thought when sober, said when <lb/>

            Nestor indeed in Sophocles' Play, trying by his words to <lb/>
            soothe exasperated Ajax, said to him mildly, <lb/>
            " I blame you not, for though your words are bad, <lb/>
            Your acts are good: :” <lb/>
            but we cannot feel so to the talkative man, for his want of <lb/>
            tact in words destroys and undoes all the grace of his <lb/>
            actions.</p>
          <p>§ v. Lysias wrote a defence for some accused person, <lb/>
            and gave it him, and he read it several times, and came to <lb/>
            Lysias in great dejection and said, " When I first perused <lb/>
            this defence, it seemed to me wonderful, but when I read it <lb/>
            a second and third time, it seemed altogether dull and in­ <lb/>
            effective. Then Lysias laughed, and said, "What then? <lb/>
            Are you going to read it more than once to the jury ? it <lb/>
            And yet do but consider the persuasiveness and grace of <lb/>
            Lysias' style ; 1 for he " I say was a great favourite with <lb/>
            the dark-haired Muses.”2 And of the things which have <lb/>
            been said of Homer the truest is that he alone of all poets <lb/>
            has survived the fastidiousness of mankind, as being ever <lb/>
            new and still at his acme as regards giving pleasure, and <lb/>
            yet saying and proclaiming about himself, " I hate to spin <lb/>
            out a plain tale over and over again," 3 he avoids and fears <lb/>
            that satiety which lies in ambush for every narrative, and <lb/>
            takes the hearer from one subject to another, and relieves <lb/>
            by novelty the possibility of being surfeited. But the <lb/>
            talkative worry one's ears to death with their tautologies, <lb/>
            as people scribble the same things over and over again on <lb/>

            those who compel people to drink it neat and in large quan­ <lb/>

            mankind, those who make a bad and ill-advised use of it <lb/>

            whom they think to gratify, and become a laughing-stock <lb/>

          <p>§ VII. Of all other passions and disorders some are dan­ <lb/>
            gerous, some hateful, some ridiculous, but in talkative­ <lb/>
            ness all these elements are combined. For praters are <lb/>
            jeered at for their commonplaces, and hated when they <lb/>
            bring bad news, and run into danger when they reveal <lb/>
            secrets. And so Anacharsis, when he was feasted by <lb/>
            Solon and lay down to sleep, and was observed with his <lb/>
            left hand on his private parts, and his right hand on his <lb/>
            mouth, for he thought his tongue needed the stronger <lb/>
            restraint, was right in his opinion. For it would be diffi­ <lb/>
            cult to find as many men who have been ruined by <lb/>
            venereal excesses as cities and leading states that have <lb/>
            been undone by the utterance of a secret. When Sulla <lb/>
            was besieging Athens, and had no time to waste there, <lb/>
            " for he had other fish to fry,”2 as Mithridates was ravag­ <lb/>
            ing Asia, and the party of Marius was again in power at <lb/>
            Rome, some old men in a barber's shop happened to <lb/>
            observe to one another that the Heptachalcon was not well <lb/>
            guarded, and that their city ran a great risk of being cap­ <lb/>
            tured at that point, and some spies who overheard this con­ <lb/>
            versation reported it to Bulla. And he at once marched up <lb/>
            his forces, and about midnight entered the city with his <lb/>
            army, and all but rased it to the ground, and filled it with <lb/>
            slaughter and dead bodies, insomuch that the Ceramicus <lb/>
            ran with blood: and he was thus savage against the <lb/>
            Athenians for their words rather than their deeds, for they <lb/>
            had spoken ill of him and his wife Metella, jumping on to <lb/>
            the walls and calling out in a jeering way, <lb/>
            " Sulla is a mulberry bestrewn with barley meal," <note type="footnote"> I See “ Hiad,” xiv. 214-217. </note><note type="footnote">2 it Allusio ad Homericum <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπεὶ πόνος ἄλλος ἐπείγει</foreign>.”—Xylander. </note> <lb/>

            and much similar banter. Thus they drew down upon <lb/>
            themselves for words, which, as Plato1 says, are a very <lb/>
            small matter, a very heavy punishment.2 The prating of <lb/>
            one man also prevented Rome from becoming free by the <lb/>
            removal of Nero. For it was only the night before the <lb/>
            tyrant was to be murdered, and all preparations had been <lb/>
            made, when he that was to do the deed going to the <lb/>
            theatre, and seeing someone in chains near the doors who <lb/>
            was about to be taken before Nero, and was bewailing his <lb/>
            sad fortune, went up close to him and whispered, " Pray <lb/>
            only, good sir, that to-day may pass by, to-morrow you <lb/>
            will owe me many thanks." He guessing the meaning of <lb/>
            the riddle, and thinking, I take it, “ he is a fool who gives <lb/>
            up what is in his hand for a remote contingency,”3 pre­ <lb/>
            ferred certain to honourable safety. For he informed <lb/>
            Nero of what the man had said, and he was immediately <lb/>
            arrested, and torture, and fire, and scourging were applied <lb/>
            to him, who denied now in his necessity what before he <lb/>
            had divulged without necessity.</p>
          <p>§ VInI. Zeno the philosopher;4 that he might not against <lb/>
            his will divulge any secrets when put to the torture, bit <lb/>
            off his tongue, and spit it at the tyrant. Famous also was <lb/>
            the reward which Leæna had for her taciturnity.5 She was <lb/>
            the mistress of Harmodius and Aristogiton, and, although <lb/>
            a woman, participated in their hopes of success in the con­ <lb/>
            spiracy against the tyrants: for she had revelled in the <lb/>
            glorious cup of love, and had been initiated in their secrets <lb/>
            through the god. When then they had failed in their attempt <lb/>
            and been put to death, and she was examined and bidden to <lb/>
            reveal the names of the other conspirators, she refused to <lb/>
            do so, and held out to the end, showing that those famous <lb/>
            men in loving such a one as her had done nothing un­ <lb/>
            worthy of them. And the Athenians erected to her <note type="footnote"> 1 “ Laws," xi. p. 935 A. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 So true are the words of Æschylus, <foreign xml:lang="grc">γλώσσῃ ματαίᾳ ζημία <lb/>

            memory a bronze lioness without a tongue, and placed it <lb/>
            near the entrance to the Acropolis, signifying her daunt­ <lb/>
            less courage by the nobleness of that animal, and by its <lb/>
            being without a tongue her silence and fidelity. For no <lb/>
            spoken word has done as much good as many unspoken <lb/>
            ones. For at some future day we can give utterance if we <lb/>
            like to what has been not said, but a word once spoken <lb/>
            cannot be recalled, but flies about and runs all round the <lb/>
            world. And this is the reason, I take it, why men teach <lb/>
            us to speak, but the gods teach us to be silent, silence being <lb/>
            enjoined on us in the mysteries and in all religious rites. <lb/>
            Thus Homer has described the most eloquent Odysseus, <lb/>
            and Telemachus, and Penelope, and the nurse, as all re­ <lb/>
            markable for their taciturnity. You remember the nurse <lb/>
            saying, <lb/>
            " I'll keep it close as heart of oak or steel.”1 <lb/>
            And Odysseus sitting by Penelope, <lb/>
            “ Though in his heart he pitied her sad grief, <lb/>
            His eyes like horn or steel impassive stood <lb/>
            Within their lids, and craft his tears repressed." 2 <lb/>
            So great control had he over all his body, and so much <lb/>
            were all his members under the sway and rule of reason, <lb/>
            that he commanded his eyes not to weep, his tongue not to <lb/>
            speak, and his heart not to tremble or quaked <lb/>
            “So calm and passive did his heart remain,"4 <lb/>
            reason penetrating even to the irrational instincts, and <lb/>
            making spirit and blood obedient and docile to it. Such <lb/>
            also were most of his companions, for though they were <lb/>
            dashed to the ground and dragged along by the Cyclops, <lb/>
            they said not a word about Odysseus, nor did they show <lb/>
            the stake of wood that had been put into the fire and pre­ <lb/>
            pared to put out Polyphemus' eye, but they would rather <lb/>
            have been eaten alive than divulge secrets, such wonderful <note type="footnote"> 1 Homer, “ Odyssey," xix. 494. Plutarch quotes from memory. The <lb/>

            self-control and fidelity had they.1 And so it was not <lb/>
            amiss of Pittacus, when the king of Egypt sent him a <lb/>
            victim, and bade him take from it the best and worst piece <lb/>
            of it, to pull out the tongue and send that to the king, as <lb/>
            being the instrument of the greatest blessings and withal <lb/>
            the greatest mischiefs.</p>
          <p>§ ix. So Ino in Euripides, speaking plainly about her­ <lb/>
            self, says she knows " how to be silent when she should, <lb/>
            and to speak when speech is safe.”2 For those who have <lb/>
            enjoyed a truly noble and royal education learn first to be <lb/>
            silent and then to speak. So the famous king Antigonus, <lb/>
            when his son asked him, " When are we going to shift our <lb/>
            quarters ? " answered, " Are you afraid that you only will <lb/>
            not hear the trumpet P " Was he afraid then to entrust a <lb/>
            secret to him, to whom he intended one day to leave his <lb/>
            kingdom ? Nay rather, it was to teach him to be close and <lb/>
            guarded on such matters. Metellus3 also, the well-known <lb/>
            veteran, when questioned somewhat similarly about an ex­ <lb/>
            pedition, said, " If I thought my coat knew the secret, <lb/>
            I would strip it off and throw it into the fire." And Eu­ <lb/>
            menes, when he heard that Craterus was marching against <lb/>
            him, told none of his friends, but pretended that it was <lb/>
            Neoptolemus ; for his soldiers despised Neoptolemus, but <lb/>
            they admired the glory and loved the virtue of Craterus; <lb/>
            and no one but Eumenes knew the truth, and they engaged <lb/>
            and were victorious, and unwittingly killed Craterus, and <lb/>
            only recognized his dead body. So great a part did silence <lb/>
            play in the battle, concealing the name of the enemy's <lb/>
            general: so that Eumenes' friends marvelled more than <lb/>
            found fault at his not having told them the truth. And if <lb/>
            anyone should receive blame in such a case, it is better to <lb/>
            be censured when one has done well by keeping one's <lb/>
            counsel, rather than to have to accuse others through <lb/>
            having come to grief by trusting them.</p>
          <p>§ x. But, generally speaking, who has the right to blame <lb/>
            the person who has not kept his secret ? For if it was not <lb/>
            to be known, it was not well to tell another person of it at <note type="footnote"> 1 See “Odyssey," ix. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κυκλώπεια</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Euripides, " Ino." Fragment, 416. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 “Significat Q. Cæcilium Metellum, de quo Liv. xl. 45, 46." <lb/>
            —Reiske. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="223"/>
            all, and if yon divulged your secret yourself and expected <lb/>
            another person to keep it, you had more faith in another <lb/>
            than in yourself. And so should he be such another as <lb/>
            yourself you are deservedly undone, and should he be a better <lb/>
            man than yourself, your safety is more than you could <lb/>
            have reckoned on, as it involved finding a man more to <lb/>
            be trusted than yourself. But you will say, He is my <lb/>
            friend. Yes, but he has another friend, whom he reposes <lb/>
            confidence in as much as you do in your friend, and that <lb/>
            other friend has one of his own, and so on, so that the <lb/>
            secret spreads in many quarters from inability to keep it <lb/>
            close in one. For as the unit never deviates from its orbit, <lb/>
            but (as its name signifies) always remains one, but the <lb/>
            number two contains within it the seeds of infinity, for <lb/>
            when it departs from itself it becomes plurality at once by <lb/>
            doubling, so speech confined in one person's breast is truly <lb/>
            secret, but if it be communicated to another it soon gets <lb/>
            noised abroad. And so Homer calls words " winged," for as <lb/>
            he that lets a bird go from his hands cannot easily get it <lb/>
            back again, so he that lets a word go from his mouth cannot <lb/>
            catch or stop it, but it is borne along " whirling on swift <lb/>
            wings," and dispersed from one person to another. When <lb/>
            a ship scuds before the gale the mariners can stop it, or at <lb/>
            least check its course with cables and anchors, but when the <lb/>
            spoken word once sails out of harbour, so to speak, there is <lb/>
            no roadstead or anchorage for it, but borne along with much <lb/>
            noise and echo it dashes its utterer on the rocks, and brings <lb/>
            him into imminent danger of shipwreck, <lb/>
            " As one might set on fire Ida's woods <lb/>
            With a small torch, so what one tells one person <lb/>
            Is soon the property of all the citizens." I</p>
          <p>§ xi. The Roman Senate had been discussing for several <lb/>
            days a secret matter, and there was much doubt and sus­ <lb/>
            picion about it. And one of the senator's wives, discreet <lb/>
            in other matters but a very woman in curiosity, pressed <lb/>
            her husband close, and entreated him to tell her what the <lb/>
            secret was ; she vowed and swore she would not divulge it, <lb/>
            and did not refrain from shedding tears at her not being <lb/>
            trusted. And he, nothing loth to convince her of her folly, <note type="footnote"> 1 Euripides, “Ino.” Fragm. 415. Compare St. James, iii. 5, 6. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="224"/>
            said, "Your importunity, wife, has prevailed, listen to a <lb/>
            dreadful and portentous matter. It has been told its by <lb/>
            the priests that a lark has been seen flying in the air with <lb/>
            a golden helmet and spear : it is this portent that we are <lb/>
            considering and discussing with the augurs, as to whether <lb/>
            it be a good or bad omen. But say nothing about it." <lb/>
            Having said these words he went into the Forum. But <lb/>
            his wife seized on the very first of her maids that entered <lb/>
            the room, and smote her breast, and tore her hair, and <lb/>
            said, " Alas ! for my husband and country! What will <lb/>
            become of us ? " wishing and teaching her maid to say, <lb/>
            " Whatever's up ? " So when she inquired she told her <lb/>
            all about it, adding that refrain common to all praters, <lb/>
            " Tell no one a word about it." The maid however had <lb/>
            scarce left her mistress when she told one of her fellow- <lb/>
            servants who was doing little or nothing, and she told her <lb/>
            lover who happened to call at that moment. So the news <lb/>
            spread to the Forum so quickly that it got the start of its <lb/>
            original author, and one of his friends meeting him said, <lb/>
            " Have you only just left your house ? " " Only just," he <lb/>
            replied. "Didn't you hear the news? said his friend. <lb/>
            “What news?" said he. "Why, that a lark has been <lb/>
            seen flying in the air with a golden helmet and spear, and <lb/>
            the Senate are met to discuss the portent." And he <lb/>
            smiled and said to himself, “You are quick, wife, for the <lb/>
            tale to get before me to the Forum ! " Then meeting some <lb/>
            of the Senators he disabused them of their panic. But to <lb/>
            punish his wife, he said when he got home, " You have <lb/>
            undone me, wife : for the secret has got abroad from my <lb/>
            house, so that I must be an exile from my country for your <lb/>
            inability to keep a secret." And on her trying to deny it, <lb/>
            and saying, " Were there not three hundred Senators that <lb/>
            heard of it as well as you ? Might not one of them have <lb/>
            divulged it ? " he replied, “Stuff o' your three hundred! <lb/>
            It was at your importunity that I invented the story, to put <lb/>
            you to the test! " This fellow tested his wife warily and <lb/>
            cunningly, as one pours water, and not wine or oil, into a <lb/>
            leaky vessel. And Fabius,1 the friend of Augustus, hearing <note type="footnote"> 1 Fabius Maximus. So Tacitus, "Annals," i. 5, who relates this <lb/>

            the Emperor in his old age mourning over the extinction <lb/>
            of his family, how two of his daughter Julia's sons were <lb/>
            dead, and how Posthumus Agrippa, the only remaining <lb/>
            one, was in exile through false accusation,1 and how he was <lb/>
            compelled to put his wife's son 2 into the succession to the <lb/>
            Empire, though he pitied Agrippa and had half a mind to <lb/>
            recall him from banishment, repeated the Emperor's words <lb/>
            to his wife, and she to Livia.3 And Livia bitterly up­ <lb/>
            braided Augustus, if he meant recalling his grandson, for <lb/>
            not having done so long ago, instead of bringing her into <lb/>
            hatred and hostility with the heir to the Empire. When <lb/>
            Fabius came in the morning as usual into the Emperor's <lb/>
            presence, and said, " Hail, Caesar ! " the Emperor replied, <lb/>

            ing of this straightway went home, and sent for his <lb/>
            wife, and said, " The Emperor knows that I have not kept <lb/>
            his secret, so I shall kill myself." And his wife replied, <lb/>
            " You have deserved your fate, since having been married <lb/>
            to me so long you did not remember and guard against my <lb/>
            incontinence of speech, but suffer me to kill myself first." <lb/>

            they were so many serpents, that they cannot control, but <lb/>

            road, and on parting from him, said, " Farewell, king <lb/>
            Seleucus." And he stretching out his right hand, and <lb/>
            drawing the man to him as if he was going to kiss him, <lb/>
            gave a sign to one of his escort to draw his sword and cut <lb/>
            the man's head off; <lb/>
            " And at his word the head roll'd in the dust.”1 <lb/>
            Whereas if he had been silent then, and kept his counsel <lb/>
            for a time, as the king afterwards became prosperous and <lb/>
            great, he would have received, I take it, greater favour for <lb/>
            his silence than for his hospitality. And yet he had I admit <lb/>
            some excuse for his want of reticence, namely hope and joy.</p>
          <p>§ XIII. But most talkative people have no excuse for <lb/>
            ruining themselves. As for example in a barber's shop one <lb/>
            day there was some conversation about the tyranny of <lb/>
            Dionysius, that it was as hard as adamant and invincible, <lb/>
            and the barber laughed and said, " Fancy your saying this <lb/>
            to me, who have my razor at his throat most days!" And <lb/>
            Dionysius hearing this had him crucified. Barbers indeed <lb/>
            are generally a talkative race, for people fond of prating <lb/>
            flock to them and sit in their shops, so that they pick up <lb/>
            the habit from their customers. It was a witty answer <note type="footnote"> 1 Homer, “Iliad," x. 457. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="227"/>
            therefore of king Archelaus,1 when a talkative barber put <lb/>
            the towel round his neck, and asked him, " How shall I <lb/>
            shave you, 0 king?" "Silently," said the monarch. It <lb/>
            was a barber that first spread the news of the great reverse <lb/>
            of the Athenians in Sicily, having heard of it at the Piræus <lb/>
            from a slave that had escaped from the island. He at <lb/>
            once left his shop, and ran into the city at full speed, <lb/>
            " that no one else should reap the fame, and he come in <lb/>
            the second,”2 of carrying the news into the town. And an <lb/>
            uproar arising, as was only to be expected, the people <lb/>
            assembled in the ecclesia, and began to investigate the <lb/>
            origin of the rumour. So the barber was dragged up and <lb/>
            questioned, but knew not the person's name who had told <lb/>
            him, so was obliged to refer its origin to an anonymous and <lb/>
            unknown person. Then anger filled the theatre, and the <lb/>
            multitude cried out, " Torture the cursed fellow, put him <lb/>
            to the rack: he has fabricated and concocted this news: <lb/>
            who else heard it ? who credits it ? " The wheel was brought, <lb/>
            the poor fellow stretched on it. Meantime those came <lb/>
            up who had brought the news, who had escaped from the <lb/>
            carnage in Sicily. Then all the multitude dispersed to <lb/>
            weep over their private sorrows, and abandoned the poor <lb/>
            barber, who remained fastened to the wheel. And when <lb/>
            released late in the evening he actually asked the execu­ <lb/>
            tioner, if they had heard how Nicias the General was slain. <lb/>
            So invincible and incorrigible a vice does habit make <lb/>
            talkativeness to be.</p>
          <p>§ XIV. And yet, as those that drink bitter and strong- <lb/>
            smelling physic are disgusted even with the cups they <lb/>
            drink it out of, so those that bring evil tidings are dis­ <lb/>
            liked and hated by their hearers. Wittily therefore has <lb/>
            Sophocles described the conversation between Creon and <lb/>
            the guard. <lb/>
            “G. Is't in your ears or in your mind you're grieved ? <lb/>
            C. Why do you thus define the seat of grief? <lb/>
            G. The doer pains your mind, but I your ears.”3 <lb/>
            However those that tell the tale grieve us as well as those <note type="footnote"> 1 Compare " Moralia," p. 177 A; Horace, “Satires," i. 7. 3: “Omni­ <lb/>
            bus et lippis notum et tonsoribus." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Homer, “Iliad,” xxii 207.</note> <note type="footnote">3 Sophocles, "Antigone," 317-319. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="228"/>
            that did the deed : and yet there is no means of checking <lb/>
            or controlling the running tongue. At Lacedæmon the <lb/>
            temple of Athene Chalcioecus 1 was broken into, and an <lb/>
            empty flagon was observed lying on the ground inside, and <lb/>
            a great concourse of people came up and discussed the <lb/>
            matter. And one of the company said, " If you will allow <lb/>
            me, I will tell you what I think about this flagon. I can­ <lb/>
            not help being of opinion that these sacrilegious wretches <lb/>
            drank hemlock, and brought wine with them, before com­ <lb/>
            mencing their nefarious and dangerous work: that so, if <lb/>
            they should fail to be detected, they might depart in safety, <lb/>
            drinking the wine neat as an antidote to the hemlock: <lb/>
            whereas should they be caught in the act, before they were <lb/>
            put to the torture they would die of the poison easily and <lb/>
            painlessly." When he had uttered these words, the idea <lb/>
            seemed so ingenious and farfetched that it looked as if it <lb/>
            could not emanate from fancy, but only from knowledge of <lb/>
            the real facts. So the crowd surrounded this man, and asked <lb/>
            him one after the other, " Who are you ? Who knows you ? <lb/>
            How come you to know all this ?" And at last he was <lb/>
            convicted in this way, and confessed that he was one of <lb/>
            those that had committed the sacrilege. And were not the <lb/>
            murderers of Ibycus similarly captured ? They were <lb/>
            sitting in the theatre, and some cranes flew over their heads, <lb/>
            and they laughed and whispered to one another, " Behold <lb/>
            the avengers of Ibycus." And this being overheard by <lb/>
            some who sat near, as Ibycus had now been some time <lb/>
            missing and inquired after, they laid hold of this remark, <lb/>
            and reported it to the magistrates. And so they were con­ <lb/>
            victed and dragged off to punishment, being brought to <lb/>
            justice not by the cranes but by their own inability to hold <lb/>
            their tongues, being compelled by some Fury or Vengeance <lb/>
            as it were to divulge the murder.2 For as in the body <lb/>
            there is an attraction to sore and suffering parts from <lb/>
            neighbouring parts, so the tongue of talkative persons, ever <lb/>
            suffering from inflammation and a throbbing pulse, attracts <lb/>
            and draws to it secret and hidden things. And so the <lb/>
            tongue ought to be fenced in, and have reason ever before <note type="footnote"> 1 See Pausanias, iii. 17 ; iv. 15$ x. 5. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Compare the idea of the people of Melita, Acts xxviii. 4. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="229"/>
            it, as a bulwark, to prevent its tripping : that we may not <lb/>
            seem to be more silly than geese, of whom it is said that, <lb/>
            when they fly from Cilicia over Mt. Taurus which swarms <lb/>
            with eagles, they carry in their mouths a large stone, which <lb/>
            they employ as a gag or bridle for their scream, and so <lb/>
            they cross over by night unobserved.</p>
          <p>§ xv. Now if anyone were to ask who is the worst and <lb/>
            most abandoned man, no one would pass over the traitor, <lb/>
            or mention anyone else. It was as the reward of treason <lb/>
            that Euthycrates roofed his house with Macedonian wood, <lb/>
            as Demosthenes tells us; and that Philocrates got a large <lb/>
            sum of money, and spent it on women and fish; and it was <lb/>
            for betraying Eretria that Euphorbus and Philagrus got an <lb/>
            estate from king Philip. But the talkative man is an <lb/>
            unhired and officious traitor, not of horses1 or- walls, but of <lb/>
            secrets which he divulges in the law courts, in factions, in <lb/>
            party-strife, no one thanking him for his pains; but should <lb/>
            anyone listen to him he thinks he is the obliged party. <lb/>
            So that what was said to a man who rashly and indiscrimi­ <lb/>
            nately squandered away all his means and bestowed them <lb/>
            on others, <lb/>
            " It is not kindness in you but disease, <lb/>
            This itch for giving,”2 <lb/>
            is appropriate also to the prater, “You don't communicate to <lb/>
            us all this out of friendship or goodwill, but it is a disease <lb/>
            in you, this itch for talking and prating."</p>
          <p>§ xvi. But all this must not be looked upon merely as <lb/>
            an indictment against talkativeness, but an attempt to cure <lb/>
            it: for we overcome the passions by judgement and practice, <lb/>
            but judgement is the first step. For no one is wont to shun, <lb/>
            and eradicate from his soul, what he does not dislike. <lb/>
            And we dislike the passions only when we discern by <lb/>
            reason the harm and shame that results to us by indulging <lb/>
            them. As we see every day in the case of talkative people: <lb/>
            if they wish to be loved, they are hated; if they desire to <lb/>
            please, they bore ; when they think they are admired, they <lb/>
            are really laughed at; they spend, and get no gain from so <note type="footnote"> 1 An Allusion to Dolon in Homer, " Iliad," x., 374, sq. according to <lb/>

            doing; they injure their friends, benefit their enemies, and <lb/>
            ruin themselves. So that the first cure and remedy of this <lb/>
            disorder will be to reckon up the shame and trouble that <lb/>
            results from it.</p>
          <p>§ XVII. In the next place we must consider the opposite <lb/>
            virtue to talkativeness, always listening to and having on <lb/>
            our lips the encomiums passed upon reserve, and remember­ <lb/>
            ing the decorum sanctity and mysterious power of silence, <lb/>
            and ever bearing in mind that terse and brief speakers, who <lb/>
            put the maximum of matter into the minimum of words, <lb/>
            are more admired and esteemed and thought wiser1 than <lb/>
            unbridled windbags. And so Plato 2 praises, and compares <lb/>
            to clever javelin-men, such as speak tersely, compressedly, <lb/>
            and concisely. And Lycurgus by using his citizens from <lb/>
            boyhood to silence taught them to perfection their brevity <lb/>
            and terseness. For as the Celtiberians make steel of iron <lb/>
            only after digging down deep in the. soil, and carefully <lb/>
            separating the iron ore, so Laconian oratory has no rind,s <lb/>
            but by the removal of all superfluous matter goes home <lb/>
            straight to the point like steel. For its sententiousness,4 <lb/>
            and pointed suppleness in repartee, comes from the habit <lb/>
            of silence. And we ought to quote such pointed sayings <lb/>
            especially to talkative people, such neatness and vigour <lb/>
            have they, as, for example, what the Lacedæmonians said <lb/>
            to Philip, " [Remember] Dionysius at Corinth.”5 And <lb/>
            again, when Philip wrote to them, " If I invade Laconia, I <lb/>
            will drive you all out of house and home," they only wrote <lb/>
            back, " If." And when king Demetrius was indignant and <lb/>
            cried out, " The Lacedæmonians have only sent me one <lb/>
            ambassador,” the ambassador was not frightened but said, <lb/>
            " Yes, one to one man." Certainly among the ancients men <lb/>
            of few words were admired. So the Amphictyones did not <lb/>
            write extracts from the Iliad or Odyssey, or the Pæans of <note type="footnote"> 1 So Shakspere has taught us, " Brevity is the soul of wit.”—Hamlet, <lb/>

            Pindar, in the temple of Pythian Apollo at Delphi, but <lb/>
            " Know thyself," " Not too much of anything,"' and “Be <lb/>
            a surety, trouble is near;"2 so much did they admire com­ <lb/>
            pactness and simplicity of speech, combining brevity with <lb/>
            shrewdness of mind. And is not the god himself short and <lb/>
            concise in his oracles P Is he not called Loxias,3 because <lb/>
            he prefers ambiguity to longwindedness ? And are not <lb/>
            those who express their meaning by signs without words <lb/>
            wonderfully praised and admired ? As Heraclitus, when <lb/>
            some of the citizens asked him to give them his opinion <lb/>
            about concord, got on the platform, and took a cup of cold <lb/>
            water, and put some barley-meal in it, and stirred it up <lb/>
            with penny-royal, thus showing them that it is being <lb/>
            content with anything, and not needing costly dainties, <lb/>
            that keeps cities in peace and concord. Scilurus, the king <lb/>
            of the Scythians, left eighty sons, and on his deathbed asked <lb/>
            for a bundle of sticks, and bade his sons break it when it <lb/>
            was tied together, and when they could not, he took the <lb/>
            sticks one by one and easily broke them all up: thus showing <lb/>
            them that their harmony and concord would make them <lb/>
            strong and hard to overthrow, while dissension would make <lb/>
            them feeble and insecure.</p>
          <p>§ XVIII. If then anyone were continually to recollect and <lb/>
            repeat these or similar terse sayings, he would probably <lb/>
            cease to be pleased with idle talk. As for myself, when I <lb/>
            consider of what importance it is to attend to reason, and <lb/>
            to keep to one's purpose, I confess I am quite put out of <lb/>
            countenance by the example of the slave of Pupius Piso <lb/>
            the orator. He, not wishing to be annoyed by their prating, <lb/>
            ordered his slaves merely to answer his questions, and not <lb/>
            say a word more. On one occasion wishing to pay honour <lb/>
            to Clodius who was then in power, he ordered him to be <lb/>
            invited to his house, and provided for him no doubt a <lb/>
            sumptuous entertainment. At the time fixed all the guests <lb/>
            were present except Clodius, for whom they waited, and <lb/>
            the host frequently sent the slave who used to invite guests <lb/>
            to see if he was coming, but when evening came, and he <lb/>
            was now quite despaired of, he said to his slave, " Did you <note type="footnote"> 1 See Pausanias, x. 24.</note> <note type="footnote">2 See Plato, " Charmides," 165 A. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 A title applied to Apollo first by Herodotus, i. 91, from his <lb/>
            ambiguous (<foreign xml:lang="grc">λοξά</foreign>) oracles. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="232"/>
            not invite him?" "Certainly," said the slave. " Why <lb/>
            then has he not come ? " said the master. “Because he <lb/>
            declined," said the slave. " Why then did you not tell me <lb/>
            of it at once?" said the master. " Because you never <lb/>
            asked me," said the slave. This was a Roman slave. But <lb/>
            an Athenian slave “while digging will tell his master on <lb/>
            what terms peace was made." So great is the force of <lb/>
            habit in all matters. And of it we will now speak.</p>
          <p>§ xix. For it is not by applying bit or bridle that we can <lb/>
            restrain the talkative person, we must master the disease <lb/>
            by habit. In the first place then, when you are in company <lb/>
            and questions are going round, accustom yourself not to <lb/>
            speak till all the rest have declined giving an answer. For <lb/>
            as Sophocles says, "counsel is not like a race;" no more <lb/>
            are question and answer. For in a race the victory belongs <lb/>
            to him who gets in first, but in company, if anyone has <lb/>
            given a satisfactory answer, it is sufficient by assenting and <lb/>
            agreeing to his view to get the reputation of being a plea­ <lb/>
            sant fellow ; and if no satisfactory answer is given, then to <lb/>
            enlighten ignorance and supply the necessary information <lb/>
            is well-timed and does not excite envy. But let us be espe­ <lb/>
            cially on our guard that, if anyone else is asked a question, <lb/>
            we do not ourselves anticipate and intercept him in giving <lb/>
            an answer. It is indeed perhaps nowhere good form, if <lb/>
            another is asked a favour, to push him aside and undertake <lb/>
            to grant it ourselves; for we shall seem so to upbraid two <lb/>
            people at once, the one who was asked as not able to grant <lb/>
            the favour, and the other as not knowing how to ask in <lb/>
            the right quarter. But especially insulting is such forward­ <lb/>
            ness and impetuosity in answering questions. For he that <lb/>
            anticipates by his own answer the person that was asked <lb/>
            the question seems to say, " What is the good of asking <lb/>
            him ? What does he know about it ? In my presence <lb/>
            nobody else ought to be asked about these matters." And <lb/>
            yet we often put questions to people, not so much because <lb/>
            we want an answer, as to elicit from them conversation and <lb/>
            friendly feeling, and from a wish to fit them for company, <lb/>
            as Socrates drew out Theætetus and Charmides. For it is <lb/>
            all one to run up and kiss one who wishes to be kissed by <lb/>
            another, or to divert to oneself the attention that he was <lb/>
            bestowing on another, as to intercept another person'is <lb/>
             <pb n="233"/>
            answers, and to transfer people's ears, and force their <lb/>
            attention, and fix them on oneself; when, even if he that <lb/>
            was asked declines to give an answer, it will be well to hold <lb/>
            oneself in reserve, and only to meet the question modestly <lb/>
            when one's turn comes, so framing one's answer as to seem <lb/>
            to oblige the person who asked the question, and as if one <lb/>
            had been appealed to for an answer by the other. For if <lb/>
            people are asked questions and cannot give a satisfactory <lb/>
            answer they are with justice excused; but he who without <lb/>
            being asked undertakes to answer a question, and antici­ <lb/>
            pates another, is disagreeable even if he succeeds, while, if <lb/>
            his answer is unsatisfactory, he is ridiculed by all the com­ <lb/>
            pany, and his failure is a source of the liveliest satisfaction <lb/>
            to them.</p>
          <p>§ xx. The next thing to practise oneself to in answering <lb/>
            the questions put to one,-a point to which the talkative <lb/>
            person ought to pay the greatest attention,-is not through <lb/>
            inadvertence to give serious answers to people who only <lb/>
            challenge you to talk in fun and sport. For some people <lb/>
            concoct questions not for real information, but simply for <lb/>
            amusement and to pass the time away, and propound them <lb/>
            to talkative people, just to have them on. Against this <lb/>
            we must be on our guard, and not rush into conversation <lb/>
            too hastily, or as if we were obliged for the chance, but we <lb/>
            must consider the character of the inquirer and his purpose. <lb/>
            When it seems that be really desires information, we should <lb/>
            accustom ourselves to pause, and interpose some interval <lb/>
            between the question and answer; during which time the <lb/>
            questioner can add anything if he chooses, and the other <lb/>
            can reflect on his answer, and not be in too great a hurry <lb/>
            about it, nor bury it in obscurity, nor, as is frequently the <lb/>
            case in too great haste, answer some other question than that <lb/>
            which was asked. The Pythian Priestess indeed was accus­ <lb/>
            tomed to utter some of her oracles at the very moment <lb/>
            before the question was put: for the god whom she serves <lb/>
            "understands the dumb, and hears the mute.”1 But he <lb/>
            that wishes to give an appropriate answer must carefully <lb/>
            consider both the question and the mind of the questioner, <lb/>
            lest it be as the proverb expresses it, <note type="footnote"> 1 Part of the words of an oracle of the Pythiam Priestess, slightly <lb/>
            changed. The whole oracle may be seen in Herodotus, i. 47. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="234"/>
            " I asked for shovels, they denied me pails.”1 <lb/>
            Besides we ought to check this greediness and hunger for <lb/>
            words, that it may not seem as if we had a flood on our <lb/>
            tongue which was dammed up, but which we were only too <lb/>
            glad to discharge2 on a question being put. Socrates <lb/>
            indeed so repressed his thirst, that he would not allow <lb/>
            himself to drink after exercise in the gymnasium, till he <lb/>
            had first drawn from the well one bucket of water and <lb/>
            poured it on to the ground, that he might accustom his <lb/>
            irrational part to wait upon reason.</p>
          <p>§ XXI. There are moreover three kinds of answers to <lb/>
            questions, the necessary, the polite, and the superfluous. <lb/>
            For instance, if anyone asked, "Is Socrates at home?" <lb/>
            one, as if backward and disinclined to answer, might say, <lb/>
            “Not at home;" or, if he wished to speak with Laconic <lb/>
            brevity, might cut off " at home," and simply say " No ;” <lb/>
            as, when Philip wrote to the Lacedæmonians to ask if they <lb/>
            would receive him in their city, they sent him back merely <lb/>
            a large "No." But another would answer more politely, <lb/>
            " He is not at home, but with the bankers," and if he <lb/>
            wished to add a little more, " be expects to see some <lb/>
            strangers there." But the superfluous prater, if he has <lb/>
            read Antimachus of Colophony says, “He is not at home, <lb/>
            but with the bankers, waiting for some Ionian strangers, <lb/>
            about whom he has had a letter from Alcibiades who is in <lb/>
            the neighbourhood of Miletus, staying with Tissapbernes <lb/>
            the satrap of the great king, who used long ago to favour <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonian party, but now attaches himself to the <lb/>
            Athenians for Alcibiades' sake, for Alcibiades desires to <lb/>
            return to his country, and so has succeeded in changing <lb/>
            the views of Tissaphernes." And then he will go over <lb/>
            the whole of the Eighth Book of Thucydides, and deluge <lb/>
            the man, till before he is aware Miletus is captured, and <lb/>
            Alcibiades is in exile the second time. In such a case <lb/>
            most of all ought we to curtail talkativeness, by following <note type="footnote"> 1 Proverb of cross purposes. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξερα̃σθαι</foreign> with Dübner. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Catullus calls him “tnmidus," i.e. long-winded, 95, 10. See also <lb/>
            Propertius, iii. 34-32. He was a Greek poet, a contemporary of Socrates <lb/>
            aud Plato, and author of a Thebaid. Pausanias mentions him, viii. 25 ; <lb/>
            ix. 35. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="235"/>
            the track of a question closely, and tracing ont our answer <lb/>
            according to the need of the questioner with the same <lb/>
            accuracy as we describe a circle. When Carneades was <lb/>
            disputing in the gymnasium before the days of his great <lb/>
            fame, the superintendent of the gymnasium sent to him a <lb/>
            message to bid him modulate his voice (for it was of the <lb/>
            loudest), and when he asked him to fix a standard, the <lb/>
            superintendent replied not amiss, " The standard of the <lb/>
            person talking with you." So the meaning of the ques­ <lb/>
            tioner ought to be the standard for the answer.</p>
          <p>§ XXII. Moreover as Socrates urged his disciples to abstain <lb/>
            from such food as tempted them to eat when they were not <lb/>
            hungry, and from such drinks as tempted them to drink <lb/>
            when they were not thirsty, so the talkative person ought to <lb/>
            be afraid most of such subjects of conversation as he most <lb/>
            delights in and repeats ad nauseam, and to try and resist <lb/>
            their influence. For example, soldiers are fond of descrip­ <lb/>
            tions about war, and thus Homer introduces Nestor fre­ <lb/>
            quently narrating his prowess and glorious deeds. And <lb/>
            generally speaking those who have been successful in the <lb/>
            law courts, or beyond their hopes been favourites of kings <lb/>
            and princes, are possessed, as it were by some disease, with <lb/>
            the itch for frequently recalling and narrating, how they <lb/>
            got on and were advanced, what struggles they underwent, <lb/>
            how they argued on some famous occasion, how they won <lb/>
            the day either as plaintiffs or defendants, what panegyrics <lb/>
            were showered upon them. For joy is much more in­ <lb/>
            clined to prate than the well-known sleeplessness repre­ <lb/>
            sented in comedies, frequently rousing itself, and finding <lb/>
            something fresh to relate. And so at any excuse they slip <lb/>
            into such narratives. For not only, <lb/>
            “Where anyone does itch, there goes his hand,"1 <lb/>
            but also delight has a voice of its own, and leads about the <lb/>
            tongue in its train, ever wishing to fortify it with memory. <lb/>
            Thus lovers spend most of their time in conversations <lb/>
            that revive the memory of their loves ; and if they cannot <lb/>
            talk to human beings about them, they talk about them to <lb/>
            inanimate objects, as, " 0 dearest bed," and, <note type="footnote"> I The mediaeval proverb, Ubi dolor ibi diyitus. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="236"/>
            " 0 happy lamp, Bacchis deems you a god, <lb/>
            And if she thinks so, then you are indeed <lb/>
            The greatest of the gods." <lb/>
            The talkative person therefore is merely as regards words a <lb/>
            white line,1 but he that is especially inclined to certain sub­ <lb/>
            jects should be especially on his guard against talking about <lb/>
            them, and should avoid such topics, since from the pleasure <lb/>
            they give him they may entice him to be very prolix and <lb/>
            tedious. The same is the case with people in regard to <lb/>
            such subjects as they think they are more experienced in <lb/>
            and acquainted with than others. For such a one, being <lb/>
            self-appreciative and fond of fame, " spends most of the <lb/>
            day in that particular branch of study in which he chances <lb/>
            to be proficient." 2 Thus he that is fond of reading will <lb/>
            give his time to research; the grammarian his to syntax ; <lb/>
            and the traveller, who has wandered over many countries, <lb/>
            his to geography. We must therefore be on our guard <lb/>
            against our favourite topics, for they are an enticement to <lb/>
            talkativeness, as its wonted haunts are to an animal. Ad­ <lb/>
            mirable therefore was the behaviour of Cyrus in chal­ <lb/>
            lenging his companions, not to those contests in which he <lb/>
            was superior to them, but to those in which he was inferior, <lb/>
            partly that he might not give them pain through his supe­ <lb/>
            riority, partly for his own benefit by learning from them. <lb/>
            But the talkative person acts just contrary, for if any sub­ <lb/>
            ject is introduced from which he might learn something <lb/>
            he did not know, this he rejects and refuses, not being <lb/>
            able to earn a good deal by a short silence,3 but be rambles <lb/>
            round the subject and babbles out stale and commonplace <lb/>
            rhapsodies. As one amongst us, who by chance had read <lb/>
            two or three of the books of Ephorus,4 bored everybody, <lb/>
            and dispersed every social party, by always narrating the <note type="footnote"> 1 A proverbial expression for having no judgment. See Sophocles, <lb/>

            so that he got nicknamed Epaminondas.</p>
          <p>§ XXIII. Nevertheless this is one of the least of the evils <lb/>
            of talkativeness, and we ought even to try and divert it <lb/>
            into such channels as these, for prating is less of a nuisance <lb/>
            when it is on some literary subject. We ought also to try <lb/>
            and get some persons to write on some topic, and so discuss <lb/>
            it by themselves. For Antipater the Stoic philosopher,1 <lb/>
            not being able or willing it seems to dispute with Carneades, <lb/>
            who inveighed vehemently against the Stoic philosophy, <lb/>
            writing and filling many books of controversy against him, <lb/>
            got the nickname of Noisy-with-the-pen; and perhaps the <lb/>
            exercise and excitement of writing, keeping him very much <lb/>
            apart from the community, might make the talkative man <lb/>
            by degrees better company to those he associated with; <lb/>
            as dogs, bestowing their rage on sticks and stones, are less <lb/>
            savage to men. It will also be very advantageous for such <lb/>
            to mix with people better and older than themselves, for <lb/>
            they will accustom themselves to be silent by standing in <lb/>
            awe of their reputation. And withal it will be well, when <lb/>
            we are going to say something, and the words are on our <lb/>
            lips, to reflect and consider, " What is this word that is so <lb/>
            eager for utterance ? To what is this tongue marching ? <lb/>
            What good will come of speaking now, or what harm of <lb/>
            silence ? " For we ought not to drop words as we should <lb/>
            a burden that pressed upon us, for the word remains still <lb/>
            after it has been spoken just the same ; but men speak <lb/>
            either on their own behalf if they want something, or to <lb/>
            benefit those that hear them, or, to gratify one another, <lb/>
            they season everyday life with speech, as one seasons food <lb/>
            with salt. But if words are neither useful to the speaker, <lb/>
            nor necessary for the hearer, nor contain any pleasure or <lb/>
            charm, why are they spoken ? For words may be idle <lb/>
            and useless as well as deeds. And besides all this we must <lb/>
            ever remember as most important the dictum of Simonides, <lb/>
            that he had often repented he had spoken, but never that <lb/>
            he had been silent: while as to the power and strength of <lb/>
            practice consider how men by much toil and painstaking <lb/>
            will get rid even of a cough or hiccough. And silence is <note type="footnote"> 1 Of Tarsus. See Cicero, De Officiis," iii. 12. </note> <lb/>

          <p>§ I. If a house is dark, or has little air, is in an exposed <lb/>
            position, or unhealthy, the best thing will probably be to <lb/>
            leave it; but if one is attached to it from long residence <lb/>
            in it, one can improve it and make it more light and airy <lb/>
            and healthy by altering the position of the windows and <lb/>
            stairs, and by throwing open new doors and shutting up <lb/>
            old ones. So some towns have been altered for the better, <lb/>
            as my native place,2 which did lie to the west and received <lb/>
            the rays of the setting sun from Parnassus, was they say <lb/>
            turned to the east by Chæron. And Empedocles the <lb/>
            naturalist is supposed to have driven away the pestilence <lb/>
            from that district, by having closed up a mountain gorge <lb/>
            that was prejudicial to health by admitting the south <lb/>
            wind to the plains. Similarly, as there are certain diseases <lb/>
            of the soul that are injurious and harmful and bring storm <lb/>
            and darkness to it, the best thing will be to eject them and <lb/>
            lay them low by giving them open sky, pure air and light, or, <lb/>
            if that cannot be, to change and improve them some way <lb/>
            or other. One such mental disease, that immediately <lb/>
            suggests itself to one, is curiosity, the desire to know other <lb/>
            people's troubles, a disease that seems neither free from <lb/>
            envy nor malignity. <lb/>
            " Malignant wretch, why art so keen to mark <lb/>
            Thy neighbour's fault, and seest not thine own ? ”8 <lb/>
            Shift your view, and turn your curiosity so as to look in­ <lb/>
            wards : if you delight to study the history of evils, you have <lb/>
            copious material at home, " as much as there is water in <lb/>
            the Alizon, or leaves on the oak," such a quantity of faults <lb/>
            will you find in your own life, and passions in your soul, <note type="footnote"> 1 Jeremy Taylor has largely borrowed from this Treatise in his <lb/>

            and shortcomings in your duty. For as Xenophon says 1 <lb/>
            good managers have one place for the vessels they use in <lb/>
            sacrificing, and another for those they use at meals, one <lb/>
            place for their farm instruments, and another for their <lb/>
            weapons of war, so your faults arise from different causes, <lb/>
            some from envy, some from jealousy, some from cowardice, <lb/>
            some from meanness. Review these, consider these; bar <lb/>
            up the curiosity that pries into your neighbours' windows <lb/>
            and passages, and open it on the men's apartments, and <lb/>
            women's apartments, and servant's attics, in your own <lb/>
            house. There this inquisitiveness and curiosity will find <lb/>
            full vent, in inquiries that will not be useless or malicious, <lb/>
            but advantageous and serviceable, each one saying to <lb/>
            himself, <lb/>
            " What have I done amiss ? What have I done ? <lb/>
            What that I ought to have done left undone ? "</p>
          <p>§ II. And now, as they say of Lamia that she is blind <lb/>
            when she sleeps at home, for she puts her eyes on her <lb/>
            dressing-table, but when she goes out she puts her eyes on <lb/>
            again, and has good sight, so each of us turns, like an <lb/>
            eye, our malicious curiosity out of doors and on others, <lb/>
            while we are frequently blind and ignorant about our own <lb/>
            faults and vices, not applying to them our eyes and light. <lb/>
            So that the curious man is more use to his enemies than to <lb/>
            himself, for he finds fault with and exposes their short­ <lb/>
            comings, and shows them what they ought to avoid and <lb/>
            correct, while he neglects most of his affairs at home, <lb/>
            owing to his excitement about things abroad. Odysseus <lb/>
            indeed would not converse with his mother till he had <lb/>
            learnt from the seer Tiresias what he went to Hades to <lb/>
            learn ; and after receiving that information, then he turned <lb/>
            to her, and asked questions about the other women, who <lb/>
            Tyro was, and who the fair Chloris, and why Epicaste2 <lb/>

            of other people, that our neighbour's grandfather was a <lb/>
            Syrian, and his grandmother a Thracian woman, and that <lb/>
            such a one owes three talents, and has not paid the interest. <lb/>
            We even inquire into such trifling matters as where some­ <lb/>
            body's wife has been, and what those two are talking in <lb/>
            the corner about. But Socrates used to busy himself in <lb/>
            examining the secret of Pythagoras' persuasive oratory, <lb/>
            and Aristippus, meeting Ischomachus at the Olympian <lb/>
            games, asked him how Socrates conversed so as to have so <lb/>
            much influence over the young men, and having received <lb/>
            from him a few scraps and samples of his style, was so <lb/>
            enthusiastic about it that he wasted away, and became <lb/>
            quite pale and lean, thirsty and parched, till he sailed to <lb/>
            Athens and drew from the fountain-head, and knew the <lb/>
            wonderful man himself and his speeches and philosophy, the <lb/>
            object of which was that men should recognize their faults <lb/>
            and so get rid of them.</p>
          <p>§ III. But some men cannot bear to look upon their own <lb/>
            life, so unlovely a spectacle is it, nor to throw and flash on <lb/>
            themselves, like a lantern, the reflection of reason ; but <lb/>
            their soul being burdened with all manner of vices, and <lb/>
            dreading and shuddering at its own interior, sallies forth and <lb/>
            wanders abroad, feeding and fattening its malignity there. <lb/>
            For as a hen, when its food stands near its coop,1 will fre­ <lb/>
            quently slip off into a corner and scratch up, <lb/>
            “Where I ween some poor little grain appears on the dunghill," <lb/>
            so curious people neglecting conversation or inquiry about <lb/>
            common matters, such as no one would try and prevent or <lb/>
            be indignant at their prying into, pick out the secret and <lb/>
            hidden troubles of every family. And yet that was a witty <lb/>
            answer of the Egyptian, to the person who asked him, <lb/>
            “What he was carrying wrapped up; ”“It was wrapped <lb/>
            up on purpose that you should not know." And you too, <lb/>
            Sir, I would say to a curious person, why do you pry into <lb/>
            what is hidden ? If it were not something bad it would <lb/>
            not be hidden. Indeed it is not usual to go into a strange <lb/>
            house without knocking at the door, and nowadays there <lb/>
            are porters, but in old times there were knockers on doors <note type="footnote"> 1 “<foreign xml:lang="grc">οἰκισκψ</foreign> corrigit Valckenarius ad Herodot. p. 557.”—Wyttenbach. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="241"/>
            to let the people inside know when anyone called, that a <lb/>
            stranger might not find the mistress or daughter of the <lb/>
            house en deshabille, or one of the slaves being corrected, or <lb/>
            the maids bawling out. But the curious person intrudes <lb/>
            on all such occasions as these, although he would be unwill­ <lb/>
            ing to be a spectator, even if invited, of a well-ordered <lb/>
            family: but the things for which bars and bolts and doors <lb/>
            are required, these he reveals and divulges openly to others. <lb/>
            Those are the most troublesome winds, as Aristo says, that <lb/>
            blow up our clothes: but the curious person not only strips <lb/>
            off the garments and clothes of his neighbours, but breaks <lb/>
            through their walls, opens their doors, and like the wanton <lb/>
            wind, that insinuates itself into maidenly reserve, he pries <lb/>
            into and calumniates dances and routs and revels.</p>
          <p>§ IV. And as Cleon is satirized in the play1 as having <lb/>
            “his hands among the Ætolians, but his soul in Peculation­ <lb/>
            town," so the soul of the curious man is at once in the <lb/>
            mansions of the rich, and the cottages of the poor, and the <lb/>
            courts of kings, and the bridal chambers of the newly <lb/>
            married; he pries into, everything, the affairs of foreigners, <lb/>
            the affairs of princes, and sometimes not without danger. <lb/>
            For just as if one were to taste aconite to investigate its <lb/>
            properties, and kill oneself before one had discovered them, <lb/>
            so those that pry into the troubles of great people ruin <lb/>
            themselves before they get the knowledge they desire; <lb/>
            even as those become blind who, neglecting the wide and <lb/>
            general diffusion all over the earth of the sun's rays, im­ <lb/>
            pudently attempt to gaze at its orb and penetrate to its light. <lb/>
            And so that was a wise answer of Philippides the Comic <lb/>
            Poet, when King Lysimachus asked him on one occasion, <lb/>
            "What would you like to have of mine? " "Anything, 0 <lb/>
            king, but your secrets." For the pleasantest and finest <lb/>
            things to be got from kings are public, as banquets, and <lb/>
            riches, and festivities, and favours : but come not near any <lb/>
            secret of theirs, pry not into it. There is no concealment <lb/>
            of the joy of a prosperous monarch, or of his laugh when <lb/>
            he is in a playful mood, or of any tokens of his goodwill <lb/>
            and favour; but dreadful is what he conceals, his gloomi­ <lb/>
            ness, his sternness, his reserve, his store of latent wrath, his <note type="footnote"> 1 Aristophanes, “Equites," 79. </note> <note type="footnote"> R </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="242"/>
            meditation on stern revenge, his jealousy of his wife, or <lb/>
            suspicion of his son, or doubt about the fidelity of a friend. <lb/>
            Flee from this cloud that is so black and threatening, for <lb/>
            when its hidden fury bursts forth, you will not fail to hear <lb/>
            its thunder and see its lightning.</p>
          <p>§ v. How shall you flee from it ? Why, by dissipating <lb/>
            and distracting your curiosity, by turning your soul to <lb/>
            better and pleasanter objects: examine the phenomena of <lb/>
            sky, and earth, and air, and sea. Are you by nature fond <lb/>
            of gazing at little or great things ? If at great, turn your <lb/>
            attention to the sun, consider its rising and setting: view <lb/>
            the changes of the moon, like the changes of our mortal <lb/>
            life, see how it waxes and wanes, <lb/>
            " How at the first it peers out small and dim <lb/>
            Till it unfolds its full and glorious Orb, <lb/>
            And when its zenith it has once attained, <lb/>
            Again it wanes, grows small, and disappears.”1 <lb/>
            These are indeed Nature's secrets, but they bring no trouble <lb/>
            on those that study them. But if you decline the study of <lb/>
            great things, inspect with curiosity smaller matters, see <lb/>
            how some plants flourish, are green and gay, and exhibit <lb/>
            their beauty, all the year round, while others are sometimes <lb/>
            gay like them, at other times, like some unthrift, run <lb/>
            through their resources entirely, and are left bare and <lb/>
            naked. Consider again their various shapes, how some <lb/>
            produce oblong fruits, others angular, others smooth and <lb/>
            round. But perhaps you will not care to pry into all this, <lb/>
            since you will find nothing bad. If you must then ever <lb/>
            bestow your time and attention on what is bad, as the <lb/>
            serpent lives but in deadly matter, go to history, and turn <lb/>
            your eye on the sum total of human misery. For there <lb/>
            you will find " the falls of men, and murders of their lives,”2 <lb/>
            rapes of women, attacks of slaves, treachery of friends, <lb/>
            mixing of poisons, envyings, jealousies, " shipwrecks of <lb/>
            families," and dethroning of princes. Sate and cloy your- <note type="footnote"> 1 Sophocles, Fragm. 713. The lines are quoted more fully by our <lb/>

            your associates.</p>
          <p>§ vi. But it seems curiosity does not rejoice in stale <lb/>
            evils, but only in fresh and recent ones, gladly viewing the <lb/>
            spectacle of tragedies of yesterday, but backward in taking <lb/>
            part in comic and festive scenes. And so the curious per­ <lb/>
            son is a languid and listless hearer to the narrator of a <lb/>
            marriage, or sacrifice, or solemn procession, he says he has <lb/>
            heard most of all that before, bids the narrator cut it short <lb/>
            and come to the point; but if his visitor tell him of the <lb/>
            violation of some girl, or the adultery of some married <lb/>
            woman, or the disputes and intended litigation of brothers, <lb/>
            he doesn't go to sleep then, nor pretend want of leisure, <lb/>
            “ But he pricks up his ears, and asks for more." <lb/>
            And indeed those lines, <lb/>
            " Alas! how quicker far to mortals' ears <lb/>
            Do ill news travel than the news of good ! " <lb/>
            are truly said of curious people. For as cupping-glasses <lb/>
            take away the worst blood, so the ears of curious people <lb/>
            attract only the worst reports; or rather, as cities have <lb/>
            certain ominous and gloomy gates, through which they <lb/>
            conduct only condemned criminals, or convey filth and <lb/>
            night soil, for nothing pure or holy has either ingress into <lb/>
            or egress from them, so into the ears of curious people goes <lb/>
            nothing good or elegant, but tales of murders travel and <lb/>
            lodge there, wafting a whiff of unholy and obscene narra­ <lb/>
            tions. <lb/>
            “ And ever in my house is heard alone <lb/>
            The sound of wailing ;” <lb/>
            this is to the curious their one Muse and Siren, this the <lb/>
            sweetest note they can hear. For curiosity desires to know <lb/>
            what is hidden and secret; but no one conceals his good <lb/>
            fortune, nay sometimes people even pretend to have such <lb/>
            advantages as they do not really possess. So the curious <lb/>
            man, eager to hear a history of what is bad, is possessed <lb/>
            by the passion of malignity, which is brother to envy and <lb/>
            jealousy. For envy is pain at another's blessings, and <lb/>
            malignity is joy at another's misfortunes: and both pro­ <lb/>
            ceed from the same savage and brutish vice, ill-nature.</p><pb n="244"/>
            
          <p>§ VII. But so unpleasant is it to everybody to have his <lb/>
            private ills brought to light, that many have died rather <lb/>
            than acquaint the doctors with their secret ailments. For <lb/>
            suppose Herophilus, or Erasistratus, or even AEsculapius <lb/>
            himself during his sojourn on earth, had gone with their <lb/>
            drugs and surgical instruments from house to house, to <lb/>
            inquire what man had a fistula in ano, or what woman had <lb/>
            a cancer in her womb ;-and yet their curiosity would have <lb/>
            been professional 1-who would not have driven them away <lb/>
            from their house, for not waiting till they were sent for, and <lb/>
            for coming without being asked to spy out their neighbours' <lb/>
            ailments P But curious people pry into these and even <lb/>
            worse matters, not from a desire to heal them, but only <lb/>
            to expose them to others, which makes them deservedly <lb/>
            hated. For we are not vexed and mortified with custom- <lb/>
            house officers when they levy toll on goods bona fide im­ <lb/>
            ported, but only when they seek for contraband articles, <lb/>
            and rip up bags and packages : and yet the law allows them <lb/>
            to do even this, and sometimes it is injurious to them not <lb/>
            to do so. But curious people abandon and neglect their <lb/>
            own affairs, and are busy about their neighbours' concerns. <lb/>
            Seldom do they go into the country, for they do not care <lb/>
            for its quiet and stillness and solitude, but if once in a. way <lb/>
            they do go there, they look more at their neighbours' vines <lb/>
            than their own, and inquire how many cows of their <lb/>
            neighbour have died, or how much of his wine has turned <lb/>
            sour, and when they are satisfied on these points they soon <lb/>
            return to town again. But the genuine countryman does <lb/>
            not willingly listen to any rumour that chances to come <lb/>
            from the town, for he quotes the following lines, <lb/>
            “ Even with spade in hand he'll tell the terms <lb/>
            On which peace was concluded: all these things <lb/>
            The cursed fellow walks about and pries into."</p>
          <p>§ VIII. But curious people shun the country as stale and <lb/>
            dull and too quiet, and push into warehouses and markets <lb/>
            and harbours, asking, " Any news ? Were you not in the <lb/>
            market in the forenoon ? " and sometimes receiving for <lb/>
            answer, “ What then ? Do you think things in the town <lb/>
            change every three hours ? ” Notwithstanding if any- <note type="footnote"> 1 All three being eminent doctors. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="245"/>
            one brings any news, he'll get off his horse, and embrace <lb/>
            him, and kiss him, and stand to listen. If however the <lb/>
            person who meets him says he has no news, he will say <lb/>
            somewhat peevishly, " No news, Sir ? Have you not been <lb/>
            in the market ? Did you not pass by the officers' quarters ? <lb/>
            Did you exchange no words with those that have just <lb/>
            arrived from Italy ? " To stop such people the Locrian <lb/>
            authorities had an excellent rule; they fined everyone coming <lb/>
            from abroad who asked what the news was. For as cooks <lb/>
            pray for plenty of meat, and fishmongers for shoals of fish, <lb/>
            so curious people pray for shoals of trouble, and plenty of <lb/>
            business, and innovations and changes, that they may have <lb/>
            something to hunt after and tittle-tattle about. Well also <lb/>
            was it in Charondas, the legislator of the people of Thurii,l <lb/>
            to forbid any of the citizens but adulterers and curious <lb/>
            persons to be ridiculed on the stage. Adultery itself <lb/>
            indeed seems to be only the fruit of curiosity about another <lb/>
            man's pleasures, and an inquiring and prying into things <lb/>
            kept close and hidden from the world ; while curiosity is a <lb/>
            tampering with and seduction of and revealing the naked­ <lb/>
            ness of secrets.2</p>
          <p>§ ix. As it is likely that much learning will produce <lb/>
            wordiness, and so Pythagoras enjoined five years' silence <lb/>
            on his scholars, calling it a truce from words,3 so defama­ <lb/>
            tion of character is sure to go with curiosity. For what <lb/>
            people are glad to hear they are glad to talk about, and <lb/>
            what they eagerly pick up from others they joyfully retail <lb/>
            to others. And so, amongst the other mischiefs of <lb/>
            curiosity, the disease runs counter to their desires; for all <lb/>
            people fight shy of them, and conceal their affairs from <lb/>
            them, and neither care to do or say anything in their pre­ <lb/>
            sence, but defer consultations, and put off investigations, <lb/>
            till such people are out of the way; and if, when some secret <lb/>
            is just about to be uttered, or some important business is <note type="footnote"> 1 " Intel ligo Charondam.”-Xylander. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Plutarch wants to show that curiosity and adultery are really the <lb/>
            same vice in principle. Hence his imagery here. Jeremy Taylor has <lb/>
            very beautifully dealt with this passage, " Holy Living," chap. ii. § v. <lb/>
            I cannot pretend to his felicity of language. Thus Plutarch makes <lb/>
            adultery mere curiosity, and curiosity a sort of adultery in regard to <lb/>
            secrets. A profoundly ethical and moral view. Compare § ix. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Compare Lucian's <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐχε γλωττία</foreign>, after <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐχεχειρία</foreign> (armistice), Lexiph. 9. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="246"/>
            just about to be arranged, some curious man happen to <lb/>
            pop in, they are mum at once and reserved, as one puts <lb/>
            away fish if the cat is about; and so frequently things <lb/>
            seen and talked about by all the rest of the world are <lb/>
            unknown only to them. For the same reason the curious <lb/>
            person never gets the confidence of anybody. For we <lb/>
            would rather entrust our letters and papers and seals to <lb/>
            slaves and strangers than to curious friends and intimates. <lb/>
            The famous Bellerophon,1 though he carried letters against <lb/>
            his life, opened them not, but abstained from reading <lb/>
            the letter to the king, as he had refused to sell his honour <lb/>
            to Proetus' wife, so great was his continence.2 For curiosity <lb/>
            and adultery both come from incontinence, and to the <lb/>
            latter is added monstrous folly and insanity. For to pass <lb/>
            by so many common and public women, and to intrude <lb/>
            oneself on some married woman,3 who is sure to be more <lb/>
            costly, and possibly less pretty to boot, is the acme of <lb/>
            madness. Yet such is the conduct of curious people. <lb/>
            They neglect many gay sights, fail to hear much that <lb/>
            would be well worth hearing, lose much fine sport and <lb/>
            pastime, to break open private letters, to put their ears to <lb/>
            their neighbour's walls, and to whisper to their slaves and <lb/>
            women-servants, practices always low, and frequently dan­ <lb/>
            gerous.</p>
          <p>§ x. It will be exceedingly useful, therefore, to deter the <lb/>
            curious from these propensities, for them to remember <lb/>
            their past experience. Simonides used to say that he <lb/>
            occasionally opened two chests for rewards and thanks <lb/>
            that he had by him, and found the one full for rewards, <lb/>
            but the one for thanks always empty.4 So if anyone were <lb/>
            to open occasionally the stores that curiosity had amassed, <lb/>
            and observe what a cargo there was of useless and idle <lb/>
            and unlovely things, perhaps the sight of all this poor <lb/>
            stuff would inspire him with disgust. Suppose someone, <lb/>
            in studying the writings of the ancients, were to pick out <lb/>
            only their worst passages, and compile them into a volume, <note type="footnote"> 1 See the story in Homer, " Iliad," vi. 155 sq. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Or self-control. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Literally, some woman shut up, or enclosed. </note><note type="footnote"> * See also our author's " On those who at e punished by the Deity <lb/>
            late," § xi. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="247"/>
            as Homer's imperfect lines, and the solecisms of the trage­ <lb/>
            dians, and Archilochus' indecent and bitter railings against <lb/>
            women, by which he so exposed himself, would he not be <lb/>
            worthy of the curse of the tragedian, <lb/>
            “ Perish, compiler of thy neighbours' ills ? " <lb/>
            And independently of such a curse, the piling up of other <lb/>
            people's misdoings is indecent and useless, and like the <lb/>
            town which Philip founded and filled with the vilest and <lb/>
            most dissolute wretches, and called Rogue Town. Curious <lb/>
            persons, indeed, making a collection of the faults and <lb/>
            errors and solecisms, not of lines or poems but of people's <lb/>
            lives, render their memory a most inelegant and unlovely <lb/>
            register of dark deeds. Just as there are in Rome some <lb/>
            people who care nothing for pictures and statues, or even <lb/>
            handsome boys or women exposed for sale, but haunt the <lb/>
            monster-market, and make eager inquiries about people <lb/>
            who have no calves, or three eyes, or arms like weasels, or <lb/>
            heads like ostriches, and look about for some <lb/>
            " Unnatural monster like the Minotaur, <lb/>
            and for a time are greatly captivated with them, but if <lb/>
            anyone continually gazes at such sights, they will soon <lb/>
            give him satiety and disgust; so let those who curiously <lb/>
            inquire into the errors and faults of life, and disgraces of <lb/>
            families, and disorders in other people's houses, first <lb/>
            remember what little favour or advantage such prying <lb/>
            has brought them on previous occasions.</p>
          <p>§ xi. Habit will be of the utmost importance in stopping <lb/>
            this propensity, if we begin early to practise self-control in <lb/>
            respect to it, for as the disease increases by habit and <lb/>
            degrees, so will its cure, as we shall see when we discuss <lb/>
            the necessary discipline. In the first place, let us begin <lb/>
            with the most trifling and unimportant matters. What <lb/>
            hardship will it be when we walk abroad not to read the <lb/>
            epitaphs on graves, or what detriment shall we suffer by <lb/>
            not glancing at the inscriptions on walls in the public <lb/>
            walks ? Let us reflect that there is nothing useful or plea­ <lb/>
            sant for us in these notices, which only record that so-and- <note type="footnote"> 1 See Euripides, Fragm., 389. Also Plutarch's "Theseus," cap. xv. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="248"/>
            so remembered so-and-so out of gratitude, and, “ Here lies <lb/>
            the best of friends," and much poor stuff of that kind ; 1 <lb/>
            which indeed do not seem to do much harm, except indi­ <lb/>
            rectly, to those that read them, by engendering the prac­ <lb/>
            tice of curiosity about things immaterial. And as hunts­ <lb/>
            men do not allow the hounds to follow any scent and run <lb/>
            where they please, but check and restrain them in leashes, <lb/>
            keeping their sense of smell pure and fresh for the ob­ <lb/>
            ject of their chase, that they may the keener dart on their <lb/>
            tracks, " following up the traces of the unfortunate beasts <lb/>
            by their scent," so we must check and repress the sallies <lb/>
            and excursions of the curious man to every object of <lb/>
            interest, whether of sight or hearing, and confine him to <lb/>
            what is useful. For as eagles and lions on the prowl keep <lb/>
            their claws sheathed that they may not lose their edge and <lb/>
            sharpness, so, when we remember that curiosity for learning <lb/>
            has also its edge and keenness, let us not entirely expend <lb/>
            or blunt it on inferior objects.</p>
          <p>§ XII. Next let us accustom ourselves when we pass a <lb/>
            strange house not to look inside at the door, or curiously <lb/>
            inspect the interior, as if we were going to pilfer something, <lb/>
            remembering always that saying of Xenocrates, that it is <lb/>
            all one whether one puts one's feet or eyes in another <lb/>
            person's house. For such prying is neither honourable, nor <lb/>
            comely, nor even agreeable. <lb/>
            " Stranger, thou'lt see within untoward sights.” <lb/>
            For such is generally the condition inside houses, utensils <lb/>
            kicking about, maids lolling about, no work going on, <lb/>
            nothing to please the eye ; and moreover such side glances, <lb/>
            and stray shots as it were, distort the soul, and are unhand­ <lb/>
            some, and the practice is a pernicious one. When Diogenes <lb/>
            saw Dioxippus, a victor at Olympia, driving up in his <lb/>
            chariot and unable to take his eyes off a handsome <lb/>
            woman who was watching the procession, but still turning <lb/>
            round and casting sheep's eyes at her, he said, “ See you <lb/>
            yon athlete straining his neck to look at a girl ? " And <lb/>
            similarly you may see curious people twisting and straining <note type="footnote">1 Plutarch rather reminds one, in his evident contempt for Epitaphs, <lb/>
            of the cynic who asked, " Where are all the bad people buried ? ” <lb/>
            Where indeed ? </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="249"/>
            their necks at every spectacle alike, from the habit and <lb/>
            practice of turning their eyes in all directions. And I <lb/>
            think the senses ought not to rove about, like an ill-trained <lb/>
            maid, when sent on an errand by the soul, but to do their <lb/>
            business, and then return quickly with the answer, and <lb/>
            afterwards to keep within the bounds of reason, and obey <lb/>
            her behests. But it is like those lines of Sophocles, <lb/>
            " Then did the Ænianian's horses bolt, <lb/>
            Unmanageable quite ;” <lb/>
            for so the senses not having, as we said, right training and <lb/>
            practice, often run away, and drag reason along with them, <lb/>
            and plunge her into unlawful excesses. And so, though <lb/>
            that story about Democritus is false, that he purposely <lb/>
            destroyed his eyesight by the reflection from burning- <lb/>
            glasses (as people sometimes shut up windows that look <lb/>
            into the street), that they might not disturb him by fre­ <lb/>
            quently calling off his attention to external things, but allow <lb/>
            him to confine himself to purely intellectual matters, yet it <lb/>
            is very true in every case that those who use the mind <lb/>
            most are least acted upon by the senses. And so the phi­ <lb/>
            losophers erected their places for study as far as possible <lb/>
            from towns, and called Night the time propitious to <lb/>
            thought,2 thinking quiet and withdrawal from worldly dis­ <lb/>
            tractions a great help towards meditating upon and solving <lb/>
            the problems of life.</p>
          <p>§ XIII. Moreover, when men are abusing and reviling <lb/>
            one another in the market-place, it is not very difficult or <lb/>
            tiresome not to go near them; or if a tumultuous con­ <lb/>
            course of people crowd together, to remain seated; or to <lb/>
            get up and go away, if you are not master of yourself. <lb/>
            For you will gain no advantage by mixing yourself up <lb/>
            with curious people: but you will derive the greatest <lb/>
            benefit from putting a force upon your inclinations, and <lb/>
            bridling your curiosity, and accustoming it to obey reason. <lb/>
            Afterwards it will be well to extend the practice still fur­ <lb/>
            ther, and not to go to the theatre when some fine piece is <lb/>
            performing, and if your friends invite you to see some <lb/>
            dancer or actor to decline, and, if there is some shouting <note type="footnote"> 1 Sophocles, a Electra," 724, 725. </note><note type="footnote">2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐφρόνη</foreign>, a stock phrase for night, is here defined. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="250"/>
            in the stadium and hippodrome, not even to turn your <lb/>
            head to look what is up. For as Socrates advised people <lb/>
            to abstain from food that made them eat when they were <lb/>
            not hungry, and from drinks that made them drink when <lb/>
            they were not thirsty, so ought we also to shun and flee <lb/>
            from those objects of interest, whether to eye or ear, that <lb/>
            master us and attract us when we stand in no need of <lb/>
            them. Thus Cyrus would not look at Panthea, but when <lb/>
            Araspes told him that her beauty was well worth inspec­ <lb/>
            tion, he replied, " For that very reason must I the more <lb/>
            abstain from seeing her, for if at your persuasion I were to <lb/>
            pay her a visit, perhaps she would persuade me to visit her <lb/>
            again when I could ill spare the time, so that I might <lb/>
            neglect important business to sit with her and gaze on her <lb/>
            charms.”1 Similarly Alexander would not see the wife of <lb/>
            Darius, who was reputed to be very beautiful, but visited <lb/>
            her mother who was old, and would not venture to look <lb/>
            upon the young and handsome queen. We on the contrary <lb/>
            peep into women's litters, and hang about their windows, <lb/>
            and think we do no harm, though we thus make our <lb/>
            curiosity a loop-hole 2 for all manner of vice.</p>
          <p>§ xiv. Moreover, as it is of great help to fair dealing <lb/>
            sometimes not to seize some honest gain, that you <lb/>
            may accustom yourself as far as possible to flee from <lb/>
            unjust gains, and as it makes greatly for virtue to abstain <lb/>
            sometimes from your own wife, that you may not ever be <lb/>
            tempted by another woman, so, applying the habit to <lb/>
            curiosity, try not to see and hear at times all that goes on <lb/>
            in your own house even, and if anyone wishes to tell you <lb/>
            anything about it give him the go-by, and decline to hear <lb/>
            him. For it was nothing but his curiosity that involved <lb/>
            CEdipus in his extreme calamities : for it was to try and find <lb/>
            out his extraction that he left Corinth and met Laius, and <lb/>
            killed him, and got his kingdom, and married his own <lb/>
            mother, and when he then seemed at the acme of felicity, <lb/>
            he must needs make further inquiries about himself; and <lb/>
            though his wife tried to prevent him, he none the less corn- <note type="footnote"> I " Historia exstat initio libri quinti Cyropædiæ.”-Reiske. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Literally, " slippery and prone to." For the metaphor of <lb/>

            polled the old man that had been an eye-witness of the <lb/>
            deed to tell him all the circumstances of it, and though he <lb/>
            long suspected how the story would end, yet when the old <lb/>
            man cried out, <lb/>
            " Alas! the dreadful tale I must then tell," <lb/>
            so inflamed was he with curiosity and trembling with im­ <lb/>
            patience, that he replied, <lb/>
            " I too must hear, for hear it now I will.”1 <lb/>
            So bitter-sweet and uncontrollable is the itch of curiosity, <lb/>
            like a sore, shedding its blood when lanced. But he that <lb/>
            is free from this disease, and calm by nature, being igno­ <lb/>
            rant of many unpleasant things, may say, <lb/>
            " Holy oblivion of all human ills, <lb/>
            What wisdom dost thou bring! " 2</p>
          <p>§ xv. We ought therefore also to accustom ourselves, <lb/>
            when we receive a letter, not to be in a tremendous hurry <lb/>
            about breaking the seal, as most people are, even tearing it <lb/>
            open with their teeth if their hands are slow; nor to rise from <lb/>
            our seat and run up to meet him, if a messenger comes; <lb/>
            and if a friend says, " I have some news to tell you," we <lb/>
            ought to say, “ I had rather you had something useful or <lb/>
            advantageous to tell me." When I was on one occasion <lb/>
            lecturing at Rome, one of my audience was the well-known <lb/>
            Rusticus, whom the Emperor Domitian afterwards had put <lb/>
            to death through envy of his glory, and a soldier came in in <lb/>
            the middle and brought him a letter from the Emperor, and <lb/>
            silence ensuing, and I stopping that he might have time <lb/>
            to read his letter, he would not, and did not open it till I <lb/>
            had finished my lecture, and the audience had dispersed; <lb/>
            so that everybody marvelled at his self-control. But when­ <lb/>
            ever anyone who has power feeds his curiosity till it is <lb/>
            strong and vehement, he can no longer easily control it, <lb/>
            when it hurries him on to illicit acts, from force of habit; <lb/>
            and such people open their friends' letters, thrust them­ <lb/>
            selves in at private meetings, become spectators of rites <note type="footnote"> 1 This and the line above are in <unclear>Sophoclos</unclear>, “Œdipus Ty annus,” <lb/>

            they ought not to witness, enter holy grounds they <lb/>
            ought not to, and pry into the lives and conversations of <lb/>
            kings.</p>
          <p>§ xvi. Indeed tyrants themselves, who must know all <lb/>
            things, are made unpopular by no class more than by their <lb/>
            spies! and talebearers. Darius in his youth, when he <lb/>
            mistrusted his own powers, and suspected and feared <lb/>
            everybody, was the first who employed spies; and the <lb/>
            Dionysiuses introduced them at Syracuse : but in a revolu­ <lb/>
            tion they were the first that the Syracusans took and tor­ <lb/>
            tured to death. Indeed informers are of the same tribe and <lb/>
            family as curious people. However informers only inves­ <lb/>
            tigate wicked acts or plots, but curious people pry into and <lb/>
            publish abroad the involuntary misfortunes of their neigh­ <lb/>
            bours. And it is said that impious people first got their <lb/>
            name from curiosity, for it seems there was a mighty famine <lb/>
            at Athens, and those people that had wheat not producing it, <lb/>
            but grinding it stealthily by night in their houses, some <lb/>
            of their neighbours went about and noticed the noise of <lb/>
            the mills grinding, and so they got their name.2 This also is <lb/>
            the origin of the well-known Greek word for informer, <lb/>
            (Sycophant, quasi Fig-informer), for when the people were <lb/>
            forbidden to export figs, those who informed against those <lb/>
            who did were called Fig-informers. It is well worth the <lb/>
            while of curious people to give their attention to this, that <lb/>
            they may be ashamed of having any similarity or connec­ <lb/>
            tion in habit with a class of people so universally hated <lb/>
            and disliked as informers.</p>

          <p>§ I. Some of the things that grow on the earth are in <lb/>

            of seeds and plants, yet those who till the ground consider <lb/>
            them indications not of a bad soil but of a rich and fat <lb/>
            one;1 so also there are passions of the soul that are not <lb/>
            good, yet are as it were offshoots of a good disposition, and <lb/>
            one likely to improve with good advice. Among these I class <lb/>
            shyness, no bad sign in itself, though it affords occasion to <lb/>
            vice. For the modest oftentimes plunge into the same <lb/>
            excesses as the shameless, but then they are pained and <lb/>
            grieved at them, and not pleased like the others. For the <lb/>
            shameless person is quite apathetic at what is disgraceful, <lb/>
            while the modest person is easily affected even at the very <lb/>
            appearance of it. Shyness is in fact an excess of modesty. <lb/>
            And thus it is called shamefacedness, because the face <lb/>
            exhibits the changes of the mind. For as dejection is <lb/>
            defined to be the grief that makes people look on the <lb/>
            ground, so shamefacedness is that shyness that cannot look <lb/>
            people in the face. And so the orator said the shameless <lb/>
            person had not pupils 2 in his eyes but harlots. The bashful <lb/>
            person on the other hand shows his delicacy and effemi­ <lb/>
            nacy of soul in his countenance, and palliates his weakness, <lb/>
            which exposes him to defeat at the hands of the impudent, <lb/>
            by the name of modesty. Cato used to say he was better <lb/>
            pleased with those lads that blushed than with those that <lb/>
            turned pale, rightly teaching us to fear censure more than <lb/>
            labour,3 and suspicion than danger. However we must <lb/>
            avoid too much timidity and fear of censure, since many <lb/>
            have played the coward, and abandoned noble ventures, <lb/>
            more from fear of a bad name than of the dangers to <lb/>
            be undergone, not being able to bear a bad reputation.</p>
          <p>§ II. As we must not disregard their weakness, so <lb/>
            neither again must we praise that rigid and stubborn <lb/>
            insensibility, " that recklessness and frantic energy to rush <lb/>
            anywhere, that seemed like a dog's courage in Anaxar­ <lb/>
            chus." * But we must contrive a harmonious blending of <lb/>
            the two, that shall remove the shamelessness of pertinacity, <lb/>
            and the weakness of excessive modesty; seeing its cure is <note type="footnote"> 1 Shakespeare puts all this into one line: " Most subject is the attest <lb/>

            difficult, and the correction of such excesses not without <lb/>
            danger. For as the husbandman, in rooting up some wild <lb/>
            and useless weed, at once plunges his spade vigorously into <lb/>
            the ground, and digs it up by the root, or burns it with <lb/>
            fire, but if he has to do with a vine that needs pruning, or <lb/>
            some apple-tree, or olive, he puts his hand to it very care­ <lb/>
            fully, being afraid of injuring any sound part; so the <lb/>
            philosopher, eradicating from the soul of the young man <lb/>
            that ignoble and untractable weed, envy, or unseasonable <lb/>
            avarice, or amputating the excessive love of pleasure, may <lb/>
            bandage and draw blood, make deep incision, and leave <lb/>
            scars: but if he has to apply reason as a corrective to a <lb/>
            tender and delicate part of the soul, such as shyness and <lb/>
            bashfulness, he is careful that he may not inadvertently <lb/>
            root up modesty as well. For nurses who are often rub­ <lb/>
            bing the dirt off their infants sometimes tear their flesh <lb/>
            and put them to torture. We ought not therefore, by <lb/>
            rubbing off the shyness of youths too much, to make them <lb/>
            too careless and contemptuous; but as those that pull <lb/>
            down houses close to temples prop up the adjacent parts, <lb/>
            so in trying to get rid of shyness we must not eradicate <lb/>
            with it the virtues akin to it, as modesty and meekness <lb/>
            and mildness, by which it insinuates itself and becomes <lb/>
            part of a man's character, flattering the bashful man that <lb/>
            he has a nature courteous and civil and affable, and not <lb/>
            hard as flint or self-willed. And so the Stoics from the <lb/>
            outset verbally distinguished shame and shyness from mo­ <lb/>
            desty, that they might not by identity of name give the <lb/>
            vice opportunity to inflict harm. But let it be granted to <lb/>
            us to use the words indiscriminately, following indeed the <lb/>
            example of Homer. For he said, <lb/>
            “ Modesty does both harm and good to men; ”1 <lb/>
            and he did well to mention the harm it does first. For it <lb/>
            becomes advantageous only through reason's curtailing its <lb/>
            excess, and reducing it to moderate proportions.</p>
          <p>§ III. In the first place, then, the person who is afflicted <lb/>
            with shyness ought to be persuaded that he suffers <lb/>
            from an injurious disease, and that nothing injurious <note type="footnote"> 1 “Iliad,” xxiv. 44, 45. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="255"/>
            can be good: nor must he be wheedled and tickled with <lb/>
            the praise of being called a nice and jolly fellow rather <lb/>
            than being styled lofty and dignified and just; nor, like <lb/>
            Pegasus in Euripides, " who stooped and crouched lower <lb/>
            than he wished ”1 to take up his rider Bellerophon, must <lb/>
            he humble himself and grant whatever favours are asked <lb/>
            him, fearing to be called hard and ungentle. They say <lb/>
            that the Egyptian Bocchoris, who was by nature very <lb/>
            severe, had an asp sent him by Isis, which coiled round his <lb/>
            head, and shaded him from above, that he might judge <lb/>
            righteously. Bashfulness on the contrary, like a dead <lb/>
            weight on languid and effeminate persons, not daring to re­ <lb/>
            fuse or contradict anybody, makes jurors deliver unjust ver­ <lb/>
            dicts, and shuts the mouth of counsellors, and makes people <lb/>
            say and do many things against their wish; and so the <lb/>
            most headstrong person is always master and lord of such, <lb/>
            through his own impudence prevailing against their mo­ <lb/>
            desty. So bashfulness, like soft and sloping ground, being <lb/>
            unable to repel or avert any attack, lies open to the most <lb/>
            shameful acts and passions. It is a bad guardian of youth, <lb/>
            as Brutus said he didn't think that person had spent his <lb/>
            youth well who had not learnt how to say No. It is a bad <lb/>
            duenna of the bridal bed and of women's apartments, as the <lb/>
            penitent adultress in Sophocles said to her seducer, <lb/>
            " You did persuade, and coax me into sin." 2 <lb/>
            Thus shyness, being first seduced by vice,3 leaves its citadel <lb/>
            unbarred, unfortified, and open to attack. By gifts people <lb/>
            ensnare the worse natures, but by persuasion and playing <lb/>
            upon their bashfulness people often seduce even good <lb/>
            women. I pass over the injury done to worldly affairs by <lb/>
            bashfulness causing people to lend to those whose credit is <lb/>
            doubtful, and to go security against their wish, for though <lb/>
            they commend that saying, " Be a surety, trouble is at <lb/>
            hand,”4 they cannot apply it when business is on hand.</p>
          <p>§ iv. It would not be easy to enumerate how many this <lb/>
            vice has ruined. When Creon said to Medea, <note type="footnote"> 1 Euripides, " Bellerophon," Fragm., 313. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Soph., Fragm., 736. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Surely it is necessary to read <foreign xml:lang="grc">προδιαφθαρε̃ισα τ̃̃ω̩̃ ἀκολάστω̩</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote">4 See Plato,“ Charmides," 165 A. </note> <lb/>

            “ Lady, 'tis better now to earn your hate, <lb/>
            Than through my softness afterwards to groan,”1 <lb/>
            he uttered a pregnant maxim for others; for he himself <lb/>
            was overcome by his bashfulness, and granted her one day <lb/>
            more, and so was the undoing of his family. And some, <lb/>
            when they suspected murder or poison, have failed through it <lb/>
            to take precautions for their safety. Thus perished Dion, <lb/>
            not ignorant that Callippus was plotting against him, but <lb/>
            ashamed to be on his guard against a friend and host. So <lb/>
            Antipater, the son of Cassander, having invited Demetrius <lb/>
            to supper, and being invited back by him for the next day, <lb/>
            was ashamed to doubt another as he had been trusted himself, <lb/>
            and went, and got his throat cut after supper. And Poly­ <lb/>
            sperchon promised Cassander for a hundred talents to <lb/>
            murder Hercules, the son of Alexander by Barsine, and <lb/>
            invited him to supper, and, as the stripling suspected and <lb/>
            feared the invitation, and pleaded as an excuse that he was <lb/>
            not very well, Polysperchon called on him, and addressed <lb/>
            him as follows, " Imitate, my lad, your father's good- <lb/>
            nature and kindness to his friends, unless indeed you fear <lb/>
            us as plotting against you." The young man was ashamed <lb/>
            to refuse any longer, so he went with him, and some of those <lb/>
            at the supper-party strangled him. And so that line of <lb/>
            Hesiod,2 <lb/>
            “ Invite your friend to supper, not your enemy," <lb/>
            is not ridiculous, as some say, or stupid advice, but wise. <lb/>
            Show no bashfulness in regard to an enemy, and do not <lb/>
            suppose him trustworthy, though he may seem so.3 For if <lb/>
            you invite you will be invited back, and if you entertain <lb/>
            others you will be entertained back to your hurt, if you let <lb/>
            the temper as it were of your caution be weakened by <lb/>
            shame.</p>
          <p>§ v. As then this disease is the cause of much mischief, <lb/>
            we must try and exterminate it by assiduous effort, begin­ <lb/>
            ning first, as people are wont to do in other matters, with <lb/>
            small and easy things. For example, if anyone pledge <lb/>
            you to drink with him at a dinner when you have had <lb/>
            enough, do not be bashful, or do violence to nature, but <note type="footnote"> 1 Euripides, “ Medea,” 290, 291. </note><note type="footnote">2 “ Works and Days," 342. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Reading with Wyttenbach, <foreign xml:lang="grc">μήδ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπόβ</foreign><unclear>ε</unclear> <foreign xml:lang="grc">πιστεύειν, δοκου̃ντα</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="257"/>
             <lb/>
            put the cup down without drinking. Again, if somebody <lb/>
            else challenge you to play at dice with him in your cups, <lb/>
            be not bashful or afraid of ridicule, but imitate Xenophanes, <lb/>
            who, when Lasus of Hermione called him coward because <lb/>
            he would not play at dice with him, admitted that he was <lb/>
            a great coward and had no courage for what was ignoble. <lb/>
            Again, if you meet with some prating fellow who attacks <lb/>
            you and sticks to you, do not be bashful, but get rid of <lb/>
            him, and hasten on and pursue your undertaking. For <lb/>
            such flights and repulses, keeping you in practice in trying <lb/>
            to overcome your bashfulness in small matters, will pre­ <lb/>
            pare you for greater occasions. And here it is well to <lb/>
            record a remark of Demosthenes. When the Athenians <lb/>
            were going to help Harpalus, and to war against Alex­ <lb/>
            ander, all of a sudden Philoxenus, who was Alexander's <lb/>
            admiral, was sighted in the offing. And the populace <lb/>
            being greatly alarmed, and speechless for fear, Demos­ <lb/>
            thenes said, " What will they do when they see the sun, if <lb/>
            they cannot lift their eyes to face a lamp ? " And what will <lb/>
            you do in important matters, if the king desires anything, <lb/>
            or the people importune you, if you cannot decline to drink <lb/>
            when your friend asks you, or evade the onset of some <lb/>
            prating fellow, but allow the trifler to waste all your time, <lb/>
            from not having nerve to say, " I will see you some other <lb/>
            time, I have no leisure now." 1</p>
          <p>§ vi. Moreover, the use and practice of restraining one's <lb/>
            bashfulness in small and unimportant matters is advan­ <lb/>
            tageous also in regard to praise. For example, if a friend's <lb/>
            harper sings badly at a drinking party, or an actor hired at <lb/>
            great cost murders 2 Menander, and most of the party clap <lb/>
            and applaud, I find it by no means hard, or bad manners, <lb/>
            to listen silently, and not to be so illiberal as to praise con­ <lb/>
            trary to one's convictions. For if in such matters you are <lb/>
            not master of yourself, what will you do if your friend <lb/>
            reads a poor poem, or parades a speech stupidly and ridicu­ <lb/>
            lously written ?3 You will praise it of course, and join <lb/>
            the flatterers in loud applause. But how then will you <note type="footnote"> 1 See Horace's very amusing“ Satire," i. ix., on such tiresome fellows, </note><note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιτρίβω</foreign> is used in the same sense by Demosthenes, p. 288. </note><note type="footnote">3 On such social pests see Juvenal, i. 1-14. </note> <note type="footnote"> <unclear>8</unclear> </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="258"/>
            find fault with your friend if be makes mistakes in busi­ <lb/>
            ness ? How will you be able to correct him, if he acts <lb/>
            improperly in reference to some office, or marriage, or the <lb/>
            state ? For I cannot indeed assent to the remark of <lb/>
            Pericles to his friend, who asked him to bear false witness <lb/>
            in his favour even to the extent of perjury, " I am your <lb/>
            friend as far as the altar." He went too far. But he that <lb/>
            has long accustomed himself never to go against his con­ <lb/>
            victions in praising a speaker, or clapping a singer, or <lb/>
            laughing at a dull buffoon, will never go to this length, <lb/>
            nor say to some impudent fellow in such matters, " Swear <lb/>
            on my behalf, bear false witness, pronounce an unjust <lb/>
            verdict."</p>
          <p>§ VII. So also we ought to refuse people that want to <lb/>
            borrow money of us, from being accustomed to say No in <lb/>
            small and easily refused matters. Thus Archelaus, king of <lb/>
            the Macedonians, being asked at supper for a gold cup by <lb/>
            a man who thought Receive the finest word in the lan­ <lb/>
            guage, bade a boy give it to Euripides,1 and gazing intently <lb/>
            on the man said to him, " You are fit to ask, and not to <lb/>
            receive, and he is fit to receive without asking." Thus did <lb/>
            he make judgement and not bashfulness the arbiter of his <lb/>
            gifts and favours. Yet we oftentimes pass over our friends <lb/>
            who are both deserving and in need, and give to others <lb/>
            who continually and impudently importune us, not from <lb/>
            the wish to give but from the inability to say No. So the <lb/>
            older Antigonus, being frequently annoyed by Bion, said, <lb/>
            “ Give a talent to Bion and necessity." Yet he was of <lb/>
            all the kings most clever and ingenious at getting rid <lb/>
            of such importunity. For on one occasion, when a Cynic <lb/>
            asked him for a drachma, he replied, " That would be too <lb/>
            little for a king to give; "2 and when the Cynic rejoined, <lb/>
            “ Give me then a talent," be met him with, " That would <lb/>
            be too much for a Cynic to receive.” 3 Diogenes indeed <note type="footnote"> 1 See Pausanias, i 2. Euripides left Athens about 409 B.C., and took <lb/>
            up his abode for good in Macedonia at the court of Archelaus, where he <lb/>
            died 406 B.C. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 For a drachma was only worth 6 obols, or 9¾d. of our money, nearly <lb/>
            = Roman denarius. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 A talent was 6,000 drachmae, or 36,000 obols, about £243 15s. <lb/>

             <pb n="259"/>
            used to go round begging to the statues in the Ceramicus, <lb/>
            and when people expressed their astonishment said he was <lb/>
            practising how to bear refusals. And we must practise <lb/>
            ourselves in small matters, and exercise ourselves in little <lb/>
            things, with a view to refusing people who importune <lb/>
            us, or would receive from us when inconvenient, that <lb/>
            we may be able to avoid great miscarriages. For no one, <lb/>
            as Demosthenes says,1 if he expends his resources on unne­ <lb/>
            cessary things, will have means for necessary ones. And <lb/>
            our disgrace is greatly increased, if we are deficient in <lb/>
            what is noble, and abound in what is trivial.</p>
          <p>§ vInI. But bashfulness is not only a bad and inconsi­ <lb/>
            derate manager of money, but also in more important <lb/>
            matters makes us reject expediency and reason. For when <lb/>
            we are ill we do not call in the experienced doctor, because <lb/>
            we stand in awe of the family one; and instead of the best <lb/>
            teachers for our boys we select those that importune us; 2 <lb/>
            and in our suits at law we frequently refuse the aid of <lb/>
            some skilled advocate, to oblige the son of some friend or <lb/>
            relative, and give him a chance to make a forensic display; <lb/>
            and lastly, you will find many so-called philosophers Epi­ <lb/>
            cureans or Stoics, not from deliberate choice or conviction, <lb/>
            but simply from bashfulness, to have the same views as <lb/>
            their friends and acquaintances. Since this is the case, let <lb/>
            us accustom ourselves betimes in small and everyday <lb/>
            matters to employ no barber or fuller merely from bash­ <lb/>
            fulness, nor to put up at a sorry inn, when a better is at <lb/>
            hand, merely because the innkeeper has on several occa­ <lb/>
            sions been extra civil to us, but for the benefit of the habit <lb/>
            to select the best even in a small matter; as the Pytha­ <lb/>
            goreans were careful never to put their left leg across the <lb/>
            right, nor to take an even number instead of an odd, all <lb/>
            other matters being indifferent. We must accustom our­ <lb/>
            selves also, at a sacrifice or marriage or any entertainment <lb/>
            of that kind, not to invite the person who greets us and <lb/>
            runs up to meet us, but the friend who is serviceable to us. <lb/>
            For he that has thus practised and trained himself will be <lb/>
            difficult to catch tripping, nay even unassailable, in greater <lb/>
            matters. <note type="footnote"> 1 “ Olynth." iii. p. 33, § 19.</note> <note type="footnote">2 Compare " On Education," § vii. </note> <pb n="260"/>
            </p>
          <p>§ ix. Let so much suffice for practice. And of useful <lb/>
            considerations the first is that which teaches and reminds <lb/>
            us, that all passions and maladies of the soul are accom­ <lb/>
            panied by the very things which we think we avoid <lb/>
            through them. Thus infamy comes through too great love <lb/>
            of fame, and pain comes from love of pleasure, and plenty of <lb/>
            work to the idle, and to the contentious defeats and losses of <lb/>
            lawsuits. And so too it is the fate of bashfulness, in fleeing <lb/>
            from the smoke of ill-repute, to throw itself into the fire of <lb/>
            it.1 For the bashful, not venturing to say No to those that <lb/>
            press them hard, afterwards feel shame at just rebuke, <lb/>
            and, through standing in awe of slight blame, frequently <lb/>
            in the end incur open disgrace. For if a friend asks some <lb/>
            money of them, and through bashfulness they cannot <lb/>
            refuse, a little time after they are disgraced by the <lb/>
            facts becoming known; 2 or if they have promised to help <lb/>
            friends in a lawsuit, they turn round and hide their <lb/>
            diminished heads, and run away from fear of the other <lb/>
            side. Many also, who have accepted on behalf of a <lb/>
            daughter or sister an unprofitable offer of marriage at the <lb/>
            bidding of bashfulness, have afterwards been compelled to <lb/>
            break their word, and break off the match.</p>
          <p>§ x. He that said all the dwellers in Asia were slaves <lb/>
            to one man because they could not say the one syllable <lb/>
            No, spoke in jest and not in earnest; but bashful persons, <lb/>
            even if they say nothing, can by raising or dropping <lb/>
            their eyebrows decline many disagreeable and unplea­ <lb/>
            sant acts of compliance. For Euripides says, " Silence is <lb/>
            an answer to wise men,"3 but we stand more in need of it <lb/>
            to inconsiderate persons, for we can talk over the sensible. <lb/>
            And indeed it is well to have at hand and frequently on <lb/>
            our lips the sayings' of good and famous men to quote to <lb/>
            those who importune us, as that of Phocion to Antipater, <lb/>
            " You cannot have me both as a friend and flatterer ; ”or <lb/>
            his remark to the Athenians, when they applauded him <note type="footnote"> 1 Our “ Out of the frying-pan into the fire." Cf. "Incidit in Scyllam <lb/>
            cupiens vitare Charybdim." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 By their having to borrow themselves. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Fragm. 947. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Or apophthegms, of which Plutarch and Lord Verulam have both <lb/>

            and bade him contribute to the expenses of a festival, " I <lb/>
            am ashamed to contribute anything to you, till I have paid <lb/>
            yonder person my debts to him," pointing out his creditor <lb/>
            Callicles. For, as Thucydides says, " It is not disgraceful <lb/>
            to admit one's poverty, but it is very much so not to try <lb/>
            to mend it." 1 But he who through stupidity or softness is <lb/>
            too bashful to say to anyone that importunes him, <lb/>
            “ Stranger, no silver white is in my caves," <lb/>
            but goes bail for him as it were through his promises, <lb/>
            " Is bound by fetters not of brass but shame.”2 <lb/>
            But Persæus,3 when he lent a sum of money to one of his <lb/>
            friends, had the fact duly attested by a banker in the <lb/>
            market-place, remembering belike that line in Hesiod,4 <lb/>
            " E'en to a brother, smiling, bring you witness." <lb/>
            And he wondering and saying, "Why all these legal <lb/>
            forms, Persaeus ? " he replied, " Ay, verily, that my money <lb/>
            may be paid back in a friendly way, and that I may not <lb/>
            have to use legal forms to get it back." For many, at <lb/>
            first too bashful to see to security, have afterwards had to <lb/>
            go to law, and lost their friend.'</p>
          <p>§ xi. Plato again, giving Helicon of Cyzicus a letter for <lb/>
            Dionysius, praised the bearer as a man of goodness and <lb/>
            moderation, but added at the end of the letter, " I write <lb/>
            you this about a man, an animal by nature apt to change." <lb/>
            But Xenocrates, though a man of austere character, was <lb/>
            prevailed upon through his bashfulness to recommend to <lb/>
            Polysperchon by letter, one who was no good man as the <lb/>
            event showed; for when the Macedonian welcomed him, <lb/>
            and inquired if he wanted any money, he asked for a <lb/>
            talent, and Polyspercbon gave it him, but wrote to Xeno­ <lb/>
            crates advising him for the future to be more careful in <lb/>
            the choice of people he recommended. But Xenocrates <lb/>
            knew not the fellow's true character; we on the other <note type="footnote"> 1 Thucydides, it 40. Pericles is the speaker. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 A slightly-changed line from Euripides' " Pirithous," Fragm. 591. <lb/>

            hand very often when we know that such and such <lb/>
            men are bad, yet give them testimonials and money, doing <lb/>
            ourselves injury, and not getting any pleasure for it, as <lb/>
            people do get in the company of whores and flatterers, but <lb/>
            being vexed and disgusted at the importunity that has upset <lb/>
            and forced our reason. For the line <lb/>
            " I know that what I'm going to do is bad,”1 <lb/>
            is especially applicable to people that importune us, when <lb/>
            one is going to perjure oneself, or deliver an unjust verdict, <lb/>
            or vote for a measure that is inexpedient, or borrow money <lb/>
            for someone who will never pay it back.</p>
          <p>§ XII. And so repentance follows more closely upon bash­ <lb/>
            fulness than upon any emotion, and that Dot afterwards <lb/>
            but in the very act. For we are vexed with ourselves when <lb/>
            we give, and ashamed when we perjure ourselves, and get <lb/>
            ill-fame from our advocacies, and are put to the blush <lb/>
            when we cannot fulfil our promises. For frequently, from <lb/>
            inability to say No, we promise impossibilities to perse­ <lb/>
            vering applicants, as introductions at court, and audiences <lb/>
            with princes, from reluctance or want of nerve to say, <lb/>
            " The king does not know us, others have his regard far <lb/>
            more." But Lysander, when he was out of favour with <lb/>
            Agesilaus, though he was thought to have very great <lb/>
            influence with him owing to his great reputation, was not <lb/>
            ashamed to dismiss suitors, and bid them go and pay their <lb/>
            court to others who had more influence with the king. For <lb/>
            not to be able to do everything carries no disgrace with it, <lb/>
            but to undertake and try and force your way to what you <lb/>
            are unable to do, or unqualified by nature for, is in addition <lb/>
            to the disgrace incurred a task full of trouble.</p>
          <p>§ XIII. To take another element into consideration, all <lb/>
            seemly and modest requests we ought readily to comply <lb/>
            with, not bashfully but heartily, whereas in injurious or <lb/>
            unreasonable requests we ought ever to remember the con­ <lb/>
            duct of Zeno, who, meeting a young man he knew walking <lb/>
            very quietly near a wall, and learning from him that he was <lb/>
            trying to get out of the way of a friend who wanted him to <lb/>
            perjure himself on his behalf, said to him, " 0 stupid fellow, <lb/>
            what do you tell me ? Is he not afraid or ashamed to <note type="footnote"> 1 Euripides, " Medea,” 1078. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="263"/>
            press you to what is not right ? And dare not you stand <lb/>
            up boldly against him for what is right?" For he that <lb/>
            said " villainy is no bad weapon against villainy "1 taught <lb/>
            people the bad practice of standing on one's defence against <lb/>
            vice by imitating it; but to get rid of those who shame­ <lb/>
            lessly and unblushingly importune us by their own effron­ <lb/>
            tery, and not to gratify the immodest in their disgrace­ <lb/>
            ful desires through false modesty, is the right and proper <lb/>
            conduct of sensible people.</p>
          <p>§ xiv. Moreover it is no great task to resist disreputable <lb/>
            and low and worthless fellows who importune you, but <lb/>
            some send such off with a laugh or a jest, as Theocritus <lb/>
            did, who, when two fellows in the public baths, one a <lb/>
            stranger, the other a well-known thief, wanted to borrow <lb/>
            his scraper,2 put them both off with a playful answer, <lb/>
            "You, sir, I don't know, and you I know too well." And <lb/>
            Lysimache,3 the priestess of Athene Polias at Athens, when <lb/>
            some muleteers that bore the sacred vessels asked her to <lb/>
            give them a drink, answered, " I hesitate to do so from fear <lb/>
            that you would make a practice of it." And when a cer­ <lb/>
            tain young man, the son of a distinguished officer, but <lb/>
            himself effeminate and far from bold, asked Antigonus for <lb/>
            promotion, he replied, " With me, young man, honours are <lb/>
            given for personal prowess, not for the prowess of an­ <lb/>
            cestors."</p>
          <p>§ XV. But if the person that importunes us be famous or <lb/>
            a man of power, for such persons are very hard to move <lb/>
            by entreaty or to get rid of when they come to sue for your <lb/>
            vote and interest, it will not perhaps be easy or even ne­ <lb/>
            cessary to behave as Cato, when quite a young man, did to <lb/>
            Catulus. Catulus was in the highest repute at Rome, and <lb/>
            at that time held the office of censor, and went to Cato, who <lb/>
            then held the office of quæstor, and tried to beg off some­ <lb/>
            one whom he had fined, and was urgent and even violent <lb/>
            in his petitions, till Cato at last lost all patience, and said, <lb/>
            “ To have you, the censor, removed by my officers against <lb/>
            your will, Catulus, would not be a seemly thing for you." <lb/>
            So Callus felt ashamed, and went off in a rage. But see <note type="footnote"> 1 Our " Set a thief to catch a thief." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Or strigil. See Otto Jahn's note on Persius. v. 126. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 “ Forsitan illa quam nominat Pausanias, i. 27.”-Reiske. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="264"/>
            whether the answers of Agesilaus and Themistocles are <lb/>
            not more modest and in better form. Agesilaus, when he <lb/>
            was asked by his father to pronounce sentence contrary to <lb/>
            the law, said, " Father, I was taught by you even from my <lb/>
            earliest years to obey the laws, so now I shall obey you and <lb/>
            do nothing contrary to law." And Themistocles, when <lb/>
            Simonides asked him to do something unjust, replied, <lb/>
            it Neither would you be a good poet if your lines violated <lb/>
            the laws of metre, nor should I be a good magistrate if I <lb/>
            gave decisions contrary to law."</p>
          <p>§ XVI. And yet it is not on account of want of metrical <lb/>
            harmony in respect to the lyre, to borrow the words of <lb/>
            Plato, that cities quarrel with cities and friends with <lb/>
            friends, and do and suffer the worst woes, but on account <lb/>
            of deviations1 from law and justice. And yet some, who <lb/>
            themselves pay great attention to melody and letters and <lb/>
            measures, do not think it wrong for others to neglect what <lb/>
            is right in magistracies and judicial sentences and business <lb/>
            generally. One must therefore deal with them in the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing manner. Does an orator ask a favour of you when <lb/>
            you are acting as juryman, or a demagogue when you are <lb/>
            sitting in council ? Say you will grant his request if he <lb/>
            first utter a solecism, or introduce a barbarism into his <lb/>
            speech; he will refuse because of the shame that would <lb/>
            attach itself to him; at any rate we see some that will <lb/>
            not in a speech let two vowels come together. If again <lb/>
            some illustrious and distinguished person importune you <lb/>
            to something bad, bid him come into the market-place <lb/>
            dancing or making wry faces, and if he refuse you will <lb/>
            have an opportunity to speak, and ask him which is more <lb/>
            disgraceful, to utter a solecism and make wry faces, or to <lb/>
            violate the Jaw and one's oath, and contrary to justice to <lb/>
            do more for a bad than for a good man. Nicostratus the <lb/>
            Argive, when Archidamus offered him a large sum of <lb/>
            money and any Lacedæmonian bride he chose if he would <lb/>
            deliver up Cromnum, said Archidamus could not be a <lb/>
            descendant of Hercules, for he travelled about and killed <lb/>
            evil-doers, whereas Archidamus tried to make evil-doers of <note type="footnote"> <unclear>1</unclear> Literally “ want of tune in." We cannot well keep up the metaphor. <lb/>
            Compare with this passage, “ That virtue may be taught," § ii. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="265"/>
            the good. In like manner, if a man of good repute tries to <lb/>
            force and importune us to something bad, let us tell him <lb/>
            that he is acting in an ignoble way, and not as his birth and <lb/>
            virtue would warrant.</p>
          <p>§ XVII. But in the case of people of no repute you must <lb/>
            see whether you can persuade the miser by your impor­ <lb/>
            tunity to lend you money without a bond, or the proud <lb/>
            man to yield you the better place, or the ambitious man <lb/>
            to surrender some office to you when he might take it him­ <lb/>
            self. For truly it would seem monstrous that, while such <lb/>
            remain firm and inflexible and unmoveable in their vicious <lb/>
            propensities, we who wish to be, and profess to be, men of <lb/>
            honour and justice should be so little masters of ourselves <lb/>
            as to abandon and betray virtue. For indeed, if those who <lb/>
            importune us do it for glory and power, it is absurd that <lb/>
            we should adorn and aggrandize others only to get infamy <lb/>
            and a bad name ourselves; like unfair umpires in the <lb/>
            public games, or like people voting only to ingratiate <lb/>
            themselves, and so bestowing improperly offices and prizes1 <lb/>
            and glory on others, while they rob themselves of respect <lb/>
            and fair fame. And if we see that the person who impor­ <lb/>
            tunes us only does so for money, does it not occur to one <lb/>
            that it is monstrous to be prodigal of one's own fame and <lb/>
            reputation merely to make somebody else's purse heavier ? <lb/>
            Why the idea must occur to most people, they sin with <lb/>
            their eyes open ; like people who are urged hard to toss off <lb/>
            big bumpers, and grunt and groan and make wry faces, <lb/>
            but at last do as they are told.</p>
          <p>§ XVIII. Such weakness of mind is like a temperament <lb/>
            of body equally susceptible to heat and cold ; for if such <lb/>
            people are praised by those that importune them they are <lb/>
            overcome and yield at once, whereas they are mortally <lb/>
            afraid of the blame and suspicions of those whose desires <lb/>
            they do not comply with. But we ought to be stout and <lb/>
            resolute in either case, neither yielding to bullying nor <lb/>
            cajolery. Thucydides indeed tells us, since envy necessarily <lb/>
            follows ability, that " he is well advised who incurs envy in <lb/>
            matters of the highest importance." 2 But we, thinking it <note type="footnote"> 1 Literally “ crowns." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Thucydides, ii. 64. Pericles is the speaker. Quoted again in <lb/>
            " How one may discern a flatterer from a friend," § XXXV. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="266"/>
            difficult to escape envy, and seeing that it is altogether <lb/>
            impossible not to incur blame or give offence to those we <lb/>
            live with, shall be well advised if we prefer the hatred of <lb/>
            the perverse to that of those who might justly find fault <lb/>
            with us for having iniquitously served their turn. And <lb/>
            indeed we ought to be on our guard against praise from <lb/>
            those who importune us, which is sure to be altogether in­ <lb/>
            sincere, and not to resemble swine, readily allowing anyone <lb/>
            that presses to make use of us from our pleasure at itching <lb/>
            and tickling, and submitting ourselves to their will. For <lb/>
            those that give their ears to flatterers differ not a whit <lb/>
            from such as let themselves be tripped up at wrestling, only <lb/>
            their overthrow and fall is more disgraceful; some for­ <lb/>
            bearing hostility and reproof in the case of bad men, that <lb/>
            they may be called merciful and humane and compas­ <lb/>
            sionate ; and others on the contrary persuaded to take up <lb/>
            unnecessary and dangerous animosities and charges by <lb/>
            those who praise them as the only men, the only people <lb/>
            that never flatter, and go so far as to entitle them their <lb/>
            mouthpieces and voices. Accordingly Bio1 compared such <lb/>
            people to jars, that you could easily take by the ears and <lb/>
            turn about at your will. Thus it is recorded that the <lb/>
            sophist Alexinus in one of his lectures said a good many <lb/>
            bad things about Stilpo the Megarian, but when one of <lb/>
            those that were present said, " Why, he was speaking in <lb/>
            your praise only the other day," he replied, " I don't doubt <lb/>
            it; for he is the best and noblest of men." Menedemus <lb/>
            on the contrary, having heard that Alexinus2 frequently <lb/>
            praised him, replied, " But I always censure him, for that <lb/>
            Yuan is bad who either praises a bad man or is blamed by <lb/>
            a good." So inflexible and proof was be against such <lb/>
            flattery, and master of that advice which Hercules in <lb/>
            Antisthenes' gave, when he ordered his sons to be grateful <lb/>
            to no one that praised them; which meant nothing else <lb/>
            than that they should not be dumbfoundered at it, nor <lb/>
            flatter again those who praised them. Very apt, I take it, <note type="footnote"> 1 “Est Bio Borysthenita, de quo vide Diog. Laërt.”-Reiske. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 “ I)e Alexino Eleo vide Diog. Laërt., ii. 109. Nostri p. 1063, 3."- <lb/>

            was the remark of Pindar to one who told him that he <lb/>
            praised him everywhere and to all persons, " I am greatly <lb/>
            obliged to you, and will make your account true by my <lb/>
            actions."</p>
          <p>§ xix. A useful precept in reference to all passions is <lb/>
            especially valuable in the case of the bashful. When they <lb/>
            have been overcome by this infirmity, and against their <lb/>
            judgement have erred and been confounded, let them fix it <lb/>
            in their memories, and, remembering the pain and grief it <lb/>
            gave them, let them recall it to their mind and be on their <lb/>
            guard for a very long time. For as travellers that have <lb/>
            stumbled against a stone, or pilots that have been wrecked <lb/>
            off a headland, if they remember these occurrences, not <lb/>
            only dread and are on their guard continually on those <lb/>
            spots, but also on all similar ones; so those that frequently <lb/>
            remember the disgrace and injury that bashfulness brought <lb/>
            them, and its sorrow and anguish, will in similar cases be <lb/>
            on their guard against their weakness, and will not readily <lb/>
            allow themselves to be subjugated by it again.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>§ I. Sylla. Those painters, Fundanus, seem to me to <lb/>
            do well who, before giving the finishing touches to their <lb/>
            paintings, lay them by for a time and then revise them ; <lb/>
            because by taking their eyes off them for a time they gain <lb/>
            by frequent inspection a new insight, and are more apt to <lb/>
            detect minute differences, that continuous familiarity would <lb/>
            have hidden. Now since a human being cannot so separate <lb/>
            himself from himself for a time, and make a break in his <lb/>
            continuity, and then approach himself again-and that is <lb/>
            perhaps the chief reason why a man is a worse judge of <lb/>
            himself than of others-the next best thing will be for a <lb/>
            man to inspect his friends after an interval, and likewise <lb/>
            offer himself to their scrutiny, not to see whether he has <lb/>
            aged quickly, or whether his bodily condition is butter or <lb/>
             <pb n="268"/>
            worse, but to examine his moral character, and see whether <lb/>
            time has added any good quality, or removed any bad one. <lb/>
            On my return then to Rome after an absence of two years, <lb/>
            and having been with you now five months, I am not at all <lb/>
            surprised that there has been a great increase and growth <lb/>
            in those good points which you formerly had owing to your <lb/>
            admirable nature; but when I see how gentle and obedient <lb/>
            to reason your former excessive impetuosity and hot temper <lb/>
            has become, it cannot but occur to me to quote the line, <lb/>
            “ Ye gods, how much more mild is he become! ”1 <lb/>
            And this mildness has not wrought in you sloth or weakness, <lb/>
            but like cultivation of the soil it has produced a smoothness <lb/>
            and depth fit for action, instead of the former impetuosity <lb/>
            and vehemence. And so it is clear that your propensity <lb/>
            to anger has not been effaced by any declining vigour or <lb/>
            through some chance, but has been cured by good precepts. <lb/>
            And indeed, for I will tell you the truth, when our friend <lb/>
            Eros2 reported this change in you to me, I suspected <lb/>
            that owing to goodwill he bare witness not of the <lb/>
            actual state of the case, but of what was becoming to all <lb/>
            good and virtuous men, although, as you know, he can <lb/>
            never be persuaded to depart from his real opinion to in­ <lb/>
            gratiate himself with anyone. But now he is acquitted <lb/>
            of false witness, and do you, as your journey gives you <lb/>
            leisure, narrate to me the mode of cure you employed to <lb/>
            make your temper so under control, so natural, gentle and <lb/>
            obedient to reason.</p>
          <p>Fundanus. Most friendly Sylla, take care that you do <lb/>
            not in your goodwill and affection to me rest under any <lb/>
            misconception of my real condition. For it is possible that <lb/>
            Eros, not being able always himself to keep his temper in <lb/>
            its place in the obedience that Homer speaks of,- but some­ <lb/>
            times carried away by his hatred of what is bad, may think <lb/>
            me grown milder than I really am, as in changes of the <lb/>
            scale in music the lowest notes become the highest.</p>
          <p>Sylla. Neither of these is the case, Fundanus, but oblige <lb/>
            me by doing as I ask. <note type="footnote"> 1 Homer, " Iliad, xxii. 373. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Alluded to again " On the tranquillity of the mind," § i. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 The allusion is to Homer's " Odyssey," xx. 23. </note> <pb n="269"/>
            </p>
          <p>§ ii. Fundanus. One of the excellent precepts then of <lb/>
            Musonius that I remember, Sylla, is this, that those who <lb/>
            wish to be well should diet themselves all their life long. <lb/>
            For I do not think we must employ reason as a cure, as <lb/>
            we do hellebore, by purging it out with the disease, but we <lb/>
            must retain it in the soul, to restrain and govern the judge­ <lb/>
            ment. For the power of reason is not like physic, but <lb/>
            wholesome food, which co-operates with good health in <lb/>
            producing a good habit of body in those by whom it is <lb/>
            taken. But admonition and reproof, when passion is at <lb/>
            its height and swelling, does little or no good, but resem­ <lb/>
            bles very closely those strong-smelling substances, that are <lb/>
            able to set on their legs again those that have fallen in <lb/>
            epileptic fits, but cannot rid them of their disease. For <lb/>
            although all other passions, even at the moment of their <lb/>
            acme, do in some sort listen to reason and admit it into the <lb/>
            soul, yet anger does not, for, as Melanthius says, <lb/>
            “ Fell things it does when it the mind unsettles," <lb/>
            for it absolutely turns reason out of doors, and bolts it out, <lb/>
            and, like those persons who burn themselves and houses <lb/>
            together, it makes all the interior full of confusion and <lb/>
            smoke and noise, so that what would be advantageous can <lb/>
            neither be seen nor heard. And so an empty ship in a <lb/>
            storm at open sea would sooner admit on board a pilot from <lb/>
            without, than a man in a tempest of rage and anger would <lb/>
            listen to another's advice, unless his own reason was first <lb/>
            prepared to hearken. But as those who expect a siege get <lb/>
            together and store up supplies, when they despair of relief <lb/>
            from without, so ought we by all means to scour the <lb/>
            country far and wide to derive aids against anger from <lb/>
            philosophy, and store them up in the soul: for, when the <lb/>
            time of need comes, we shall find it no easy task to import <lb/>
            them. For either the soul doesn't hear what is said with­ <lb/>
            out because of the uproar, if it have not within its own <lb/>
            reason (like a boatswain as it were) to receive at once and <lb/>
            understand every exhortation; or if it does hear, it despises <lb/>
            what is uttered mildly and gently, while it is exasperated <lb/>
            by harsh censure. For anger being haughty and self- <lb/>
            willed and hard to be worked upon by another, like a <lb/>
             <pb n="270"/>
            fortified tyranny, must have someone born and bred <lb/>
            within it1 to overthrow it.</p>
          <p>§ III. Now long-continued anger, and frequent giving <lb/>
            way to it, produces an evil disposition of soul, which people <lb/>
            call irascibility, and which ends in passionateness, bitter­ <lb/>
            ness, and peevishness, whenever the mind becomes sore and <lb/>
            vexed at trifles and querulous at everyday occurrences, <lb/>
            like iron thin and beaten out too fine. But when the <lb/>
            judgement checks and suppresses at once the rising anger, <lb/>
            it not only cures the soul for the moment, but restores its <lb/>
            tone and balance for the future. It has happened to myself <lb/>
            indeed twice or thrice, when I strongly fought against anger, <lb/>
            that I was in the same plight as the Thebans, who after <lb/>
            they had once defeated the Lacedæmonians, whom they <lb/>
            had hitherto thought invincible, never lost a battle against <lb/>
            them again. I then felt confident that reason can win the <lb/>
            victory. I saw also that anger is not only appeased by the <lb/>
            sprinkling of cold water, as Aristotle attested, but is also <lb/>
            extinguished by the action of fear ; aye, and, as Homer tells <lb/>
            us, anger has been cured and has melted away in the case <lb/>
            of many by some sudden joy. So that I came to the con­ <lb/>
            clusion that this passion is not incurable for those who <lb/>
            wish to be cured. For it does not arise from great and <lb/>
            important causes, but banter and joking, a laugh or a nod, <lb/>
            and similar trifles make many angry, as Helen by addressing <lb/>
            her niece, <lb/>
            " Electra, maiden now for no short time," 2 <lb/>
            provoked her to reply, <lb/>
            “ Your wisdom blossoms late, since formerly <lb/>
            You left your house in shame; " 3 <lb/>
            and Callisthenes incensed Alexander, by saying, when a <lb/>
            huge cup was brought to him, “ I will not drink to Alex­ <lb/>
            ander till I shall require the help of Æsculapius.”</p>
          <p>§ iv. As then it is easy to put out a flame kindled in <lb/>
            the hair of hares and in wicks and rubbish, but if it once <lb/>
            gets hold of things solid and thick, it quickly destroys and <lb/>
            consumes them, “ raging amidst the lofty work of the <note type="footnote"> 1 Reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξ ἑαυτου̃</foreign> with Reiske.</note> <note type="footnote">2 Euripides, " Orestes," 72. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Euripides, " Orestes," 99. </note> <lb/>

            carpenters," as Æschylus1 says ; so he that observes anger <lb/>
            in its rise, and sees it gradually smoking and bursting forth <lb/>
            into fire from some chatter or rubbishy scurrility, need <lb/>
            have no great trouble with it, but can frequently smother <lb/>
            it merely by silence and contempt. For as a person puts <lb/>
            out a fire by bringing no fuel to it, so with respect to <lb/>
            anger, he that does not in the beginning fan it, and <lb/>
            stir up its rage in himself, keeps it off and destroys it. <lb/>
            And so, though Hieronymus has given -as many useful <lb/>
            sayings and precepts, I am not pleased with his remark <lb/>
            that there is no perception of anger in its birth, but <lb/>
            only in its actual developement, so quick is it. For <lb/>
            none of the passions when stirred up and set in motion <lb/>
            has so palpable a birth and growth as anger. As indeed <lb/>
            Homer skilfully shows us, where he represents Achilles as <lb/>
            seized at once with grief, when word was brought him of <lb/>
            Patroclus' death, in the line, <lb/>
            " Thus spake he, and griefs dark cloud covered him ;” 2 <lb/>
            whereas he represents him as waxing angry with Agamem­ <lb/>
            non slowly, and as inflamed by his many words, which if <lb/>
            either of them3 had abstained from, their quarrel would <lb/>
            not have attained such growth and magnitude. And so <lb/>
            Socrates, as often as he perceived any anger rising in him <lb/>
            against any of his friends, "setting himself like some ocean <lb/>
            promontory to break the violence of the waves," would <lb/>
            lower his voice, and put on a smiling countenance, and <lb/>
            give his eye a gentler expression, by inclining in the other <lb/>
            direction and running counter to his passion, thus keeping <lb/>
            himself from fall and defeat.</p>
          <p>§ v. For the first way, my friend, to overcome anger, <lb/>
            like the putting down of some tyrant, is not to obey or <lb/>
            listen to it when it bids you speak loud, and look fierce, <lb/>
            and beat yourself, but to remain quiet, and not to make <lb/>
            the passion more intense, as one would a disease, by tossing <lb/>
            about and crying out. In love affairs indeed, such things <lb/>
            as revellings, and serenadings, and crowning the loved <note type="footnote"> 1 Fragment 361.</note> <note type="footnote">a Homer, " Iliad,” xvii. 591. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 The reading of the MSS. is <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτω̃ν</foreign>, </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="272"/>
            one's door with garlands, may indeed bring some pleasant <lb/>
            and elegant relief. <lb/>
            " I went, but asked not who or whose she was, <lb/>
            I merely kissed her door-post. If that be <lb/>
            A crime, I do plead guilty to the same.”1 <lb/>
            In the case of mourners also giving up to weeping and <lb/>
            wailing takes away with the tears much of the grief. But <lb/>
            anger on the contrary is much more fanned by what angry <lb/>
            persons do and say. It is best therefore to be calm, or <lb/>
            to flee and hide ourselves and go to a haven of quiet, when <lb/>
            we feel the fit of temper coming upon us as an epileptic <lb/>
            fit, that we fall not, or rather fall not on others, for it is <lb/>
            our friends that we fall upon most and most frequently. <lb/>
            For we do not love all, nor envy all, nor fear all men ; but <lb/>
            nothing is untouched or unassailed by anger; for we are <lb/>
            angry with friends and enemies, parents and children, aye, <lb/>
            and with the gods, and beasts, and even things inanimate, <lb/>
            as was Thamyris, <lb/>
            " Breaking his gold-bound horn, breaking the music <lb/>
            Of well-compacted lyrea;”2 <lb/>
            and Pandarus, who called down a curse upon himself, if <lb/>
            he did not burn his bow after breaking it with his <lb/>
            bands.”3 And Xerxes inflicted stripes and blows on the <lb/>
            sea, and sent letters to Mount Athos, " Divine Athos, <lb/>
            whose top reaches heaven, put not in the way of my works <lb/>
            stones large and difficult to deal with, or else I will hew <lb/>
            thee down, and throw thee into the sea." For anger has <lb/>
            many formidable aspects, and many ridiculous ones, so that <lb/>
            of all the passions it is the most hated and despised. It <lb/>
            will be well to consider both aspects.</p>
          <p>§ vi. To begin then, whether my process was wrong or <lb/>
            right I know not, but I began my cure of anger by noticing <lb/>
            its effects in others, as the Lacedæmonians study the <lb/>
            nature of drunkenness in the Helots. And in the first <lb/>
            place, as Hippocrates tells us that disease is most dangerous <lb/>
            in which the face of the patient is most unlike himself, <lb/>
            so observing that people beside themselves with anger <note type="footnote"> 1 Lines of Callimachus. <foreign xml:lang="grc">φλιήν</foreign> is the admirable emendation of Sal­ <lb/>
            masius. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Sophocles, “ Thamyras," Fragm. 232.</note> <note type="footnote">3 “ Iliad,” v. 214-216. </note> <lb/>

            change their face, colour, walk, and voice, I formed <lb/>
            an impression as it were of that aspect of passion, and was <lb/>
            very disgusted with myself if ever I should appear so <lb/>
            frightful and like one out of his mind to my friends and <lb/>
            wife and daughters, not only wild and unlike oneself in <lb/>
            appearance, but also with a voice savage and harsh, as I <lb/>
            had noticed in some 1 of my acquaintance, who could neither <lb/>
            preserve for anger their ordinary behaviour, or demea­ <lb/>
            nour, or grace of language, or persuasiveness and gentle­ <lb/>
            ness in conversation. Caius Gracchus, indeed, the orator, <lb/>
            whose character was harsh and style of oratory impassioned, <lb/>
            had a pitch-pipe made for him, such as musicians use to <lb/>
            heighten or lower their voices by degrees, and this, when <lb/>
            he was making a speech, a slave stood behind him and held, <lb/>
            and used to give him a mild and gentle note on it, whereby <lb/>
            he lowered his key, and removed from his voice the harsh <lb/>
            and passionate element, charming and laying the heat of <lb/>
            the orator, <lb/>
            “ As shepherds' wax-joined reed sounds musically <lb/>
            With sleep provoking strain." 2 <lb/>
            For myself if I had some elegant and sprightly companion, <lb/>
            I should not be vexed at his showing me a looking-glass <lb/>
            in my fits of anger, as they offer one to some after a bath <lb/>
            to little useful end. For to behold oneself unnaturally <lb/>
            distorted in countenance will condemn anger in no small <lb/>
            degree. The poets playfully tell us that Athene when play­ <lb/>
            ing on the pipe was rebuked thus by a Satyr, <lb/>
            " That look no way becomes you, take your armour, <lb/>
            Lay down your pipes, and do compose your cheeks," <lb/>
            and though she paid no attention to him, yet afterwards <lb/>
            when she saw her face in a river, she felt vexed and threw <lb/>
            her pipes away, although art had made melody a compen­ <lb/>
            sation for her unsightliness. And Marsyas, it seems, by a <lb/>
            sort of mouthpiece forcibly repressed the violence of his <lb/>
            breath, and tricked up and hid the contortion of his face, <lb/>
            " Around his shaggy temples put bright gold, <lb/>
            And o'er his open mouth thongs tied behind." <note type="footnote"> 1 Reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνίοις</foreign>, as Wyttenbach suggests. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Aeschylus, " Prometheus," 574,575. </note> <note type="footnote"> T </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="274"/>
            Now anger, that puffs up and distends the face so as to <lb/>
            look ugly, utters a voice still more harsh and unpleasant, <lb/>
            “ Moving the mind's chords undisturbed before." <lb/>
            They say that the sea is cleansed when agitated by the <lb/>
            winds it throws up tangle and seaweed; but the intem­ <lb/>
            perate and bitter and vain words, which the mind throws <lb/>
            up when the soul is agitated, defile the speakers of them <lb/>
            first of all and fill them with infamy, as always having <lb/>
            those thoughts within their bosom and being defiled with <lb/>
            them, but only giving vent to them in anger. And so for <lb/>
            a word which is, as Plato styles it, " a very small matter," <lb/>
            they incur a most heavy punishment, for they get reputed <lb/>
            to be enemies, and evil speakers, and malignant in dis­ <lb/>
            position.</p>
          <p>§ VII. Seeing and observing all this, it occurs to me to <lb/>
            take it as a matter of fact, and record it for my own <lb/>
            general use, that if it is good to keep the tongue soft and <lb/>
            smooth in a fever, it is better to keep it so in anger. For <lb/>
            if the tongue of people in a fever be unnatural, it is a bad <lb/>
            sign, but not the cause of their malady; but the tongue of <lb/>
            angry people, being rough and foul, and breaking out into <lb/>
            unseemly speeches, produces insults that work irremediable <lb/>
            mischief, and argue deep-rooted malevolence within. For <lb/>
            wine drunk neat does not exhibit the soul in so ungovern­ <lb/>
            able and hateful a condition as temper does: for the <lb/>
            outbreaks of the one smack of laughter and fun, while <lb/>
            those of the other are compounded with gall: and at a <lb/>
            drinking-bout he that is silent is burdensome to the <lb/>
            company and tiresome, whereas in anger nothing is more <lb/>
            highly thought of than silence, as Sappho advises, <lb/>
            " When anger's busy in the brain <lb/>
            Thy idly-barking tongue restrain.,,</p>
          <p>§ VIlI. And not only does the consideration of all this <lb/>
            naturally arise from observing ourselves in the moments of <lb/>
            anger, but we cannot help seeing also the other properties <lb/>
            of rage, how ignoble it is, how unmanly, how devoid of <lb/>
            dignity and greatness of mind ! And yet to most people <lb/>
            its noise seems vigour, its threatening confidence, and its <lb/>
            obstinacy force of character ; some even not wisely entitle <lb/>
            its savageness magnanimity, and its implacability firmness, <lb/>
             <pb n="275"/>
            and its morosity hatred of what is bad. For their actions <lb/>
            and motions and whole demeanour argue great littleness <lb/>
            and meanness, not only when they are fierce with little <lb/>
            boys, and peevish with women, and think it right to treat <lb/>
            dogs and horses and mules with harshness, as Ctesiphon <lb/>
            the pancratiast thought fit to kick back a mule that had <lb/>
            kicked him, but even in the butcheries that tyrants commit <lb/>
            their littleness of soul is apparent in their savageness, and <lb/>
            their suffering in their action, so that they are like the <lb/>
            bites of serpents, that, when they are burnt and smart with <lb/>
            pain, violently thrust their venom on those that have hurt <lb/>
            them. For as a swelling is produced in the flesh by a <lb/>
            heavy blow, so in softest souls the inclination to hurt <lb/>
            others gets its greater strength from greater weakness. <lb/>
            Thus women are more prone to anger than men, and people <lb/>
            in than people well, and old men than men in their prime, <lb/>
            and the unfortunate than the prosperous ; the miser is <lb/>
            most prone to anger with his steward, the glutton with his <lb/>
            cook, the jealous man with his wife, the vain man when he <lb/>
            is spoken ill of ; and worst of all are those " men who are <lb/>
            too eager in states for office, or to head a faction, a manifest <lb/>
            Borrow," to borrow Pindar's words. So from the very <lb/>
            great pain and suffering of the soul there arises mainly from <lb/>
            weakness anger, which is not like the nerves of the soul, <lb/>
            as some one defined it, but like its strainings and convul­ <lb/>
            sions when it is excessively vehement in its thirst for <lb/>
            revenge.</p>
          <p>§ ix. Such bad examples as these were not pleasant to <lb/>
            look at but necessary, but I shall now proceed to describe <lb/>
            people who have been mild and easy in dealing with anger, <lb/>
            conduct gratifying either to see or hear about, being utterly <lb/>
            disgusted1 with people who use such language as, <lb/>
            “ You have a man wronged : shall a man stand this ? ” <lb/>
            and, <lb/>
            " Put your heel upon his neck, and dash his head against the ground," <lb/>
            and other provoking expressions such as these, by which <lb/>
            some not well have transferred anger from the woman's <note type="footnote"> 1 It will be seen I adopt the reading and punctuation of Xylander. </note> <lb/>

            side of the house to the man's. For manliness in all other <lb/>
            respects seems to resemble justice, and to differ from it <lb/>
            only in respect to gentleness, with which it has more <lb/>
            affinities. For it sometimes happens to worse men to <lb/>
            govern better ones, but to erect a trophy in the soul against <lb/>
            anger (which Heraclitus says it is difficult to contend <lb/>
            against, for whatever it wishes is bought at the price of the <lb/>
            soul), is a proof of power so great and victorious as to be <lb/>
            able to apply the judgement as if it were nerves and sinews <lb/>
            to the passions. So I always try to collect and peruse the <lb/>
            remarks on this subject not only of the philosophers, who <lb/>
            foolish1 people say had no gall in their composition, but <lb/>
            still more of kings and tyrants. Such was the remark of <lb/>
            Antigonus to his soldiers, when they were abusing him <lb/>
            near his tent as if he were not listening, so he put his staff <lb/>
            out, and said, " What's to do ? can you not go rather <lb/>
            farther off to run me down ?” And when Arcadio the <lb/>
            Achæan, who was always railing against Philip, and ad­ <lb/>
            vising people to flee <lb/>
            “ Unto a country where they knew not Philip," <lb/>
            visited Macedonia afterwards on some chance or other, <lb/>
            the king's friends thought he ought to be punished and the <lb/>
            matter not looked over; but Philip treated him kindly, <lb/>
            snd sent him presents and gifts, and afterwards bade inquiry <lb/>
            to be made as to what sort of account of him Arcadio now <lb/>
            gave to the Greeks; and when all testified that the fellow <lb/>
            had become a wonderful praiser of the king, Philip said, <lb/>
            “ You see I knew how to cure him better than all of you." <lb/>
            And at the Olympian games when there was defamation <lb/>
            of Philip, and some of his suite said to him, that the <lb/>
            Greeks ought to smart for it, because they railed against <lb/>
            him when they were treated well by him, he replied, <lb/>
            " What will they do then if they are treated badly by me ? " <lb/>
            Excellent also was the behaviour of Pisistratus to Thrasy­ <lb/>
            bulus, and of Porsena to Mucius, and of Magas to Philemon. <lb/>
            As to Magas, after he had been publicly jeered at by <lb/>
            Philemon in one of his comedies at the theatre in the <lb/>
            following words, <note type="footnote"> 1 This is the reading of Reiske and Dübner. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="277"/>
            “ Magas, the king hath written thee a letter, <lb/>
            Unhappy Magas, since thou can'st not read," <lb/>
            after having taken Philemon, who had been cast on shore <lb/>
            by a storm at Parætonium, he commanded one of his <lb/>
            soldiers only to touch his neck with the naked sword and <lb/>
            then to go away quietly, and dismissed him, after sending <lb/>
            him a ball and some dice as if he were a silly boy. And <lb/>
            Ptolemy on one occasion, flouting a grammarian for his <lb/>
            ignorance, asked him who was the father of Peleus, and he <lb/>
            answered, " I will tell you, if you tell me first who was the <lb/>
            father of Lagus." This was a jeer at the obscure birth of <lb/>
            the king, and all his courtiers were indignant at it as an <lb/>
            unpardonable liberty; but Ptolemy said, “If it is not <lb/>
            kingly to take a flout, neither is it kingly to give one." And <lb/>
            Alexander was more savage than usual in his behaviour to <lb/>
            Callisthenes and Clitus. So Porus, when he was taken <lb/>
            captive, begged Alexander to use him as a king. And on <lb/>
            his inquiring, " What, nothing more ? " he replied " No. <lb/>
            For everything is included in being used as a king." So <lb/>
            they call the king of the gods Milichius,1 while they call <lb/>
            Ares Maimactes; 2 and punishment and torture they assign <lb/>
            to the Erinnyes and to demons, not to the gods or Olympus.</p>
          <p>§ x. As then a certain person passed the following re­ <lb/>
            mark on Philip when he had razed Olynthus to the ground, <lb/>
            “ He certainly could not build such another city," so we <lb/>
            may say to anger, " You can root up, and destroy, and <lb/>
            throw down, but to raise up and save and spare and tolerate <lb/>
            is the work of mildness and moderation, the work of a <lb/>
            Camillus, a Metellus, an Aristides, a Socrates; but to <lb/>
            sting and bite is to resemble the ant and horse-fly. For, <lb/>
            indeed, when I consider revenge, I find its angry method <lb/>
            to be for the most part ineffectual, since it spends itself in <lb/>
            biting the lips and gnashing the teeth, and in vain attacks, <lb/>
            and in railings coupled with foolish threats, and eventually <lb/>
            resembles children running races, who from feebleness <lb/>
            ridiculously tumble down bbfore they reach the goal they <lb/>
            are hastening to. So that speech of the Rhodian to a <note type="footnote"> 1 That is mild. Zeus is so called, Pausanias, i. 37 ; ii. 9, 20. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 That is, fierce, furious. It will be seen I adopt the suggestion of <lb/>

            lictor of the Roman prætor who was shouting and talking <lb/>
            insolently was not inapt, " It is no matter to me what you <lb/>
            say, but what your master thinks.”1 And Sophocles, when <lb/>
            he had introduced Neoptolemus and Eurypylus as armed <lb/>
            for the battle, gives them this high commendation,2 <lb/>
            " They rushed into the midst of armed warriors." <lb/>
            Some barbarians indeed poison their steel, but bravery has <lb/>
            no need of gall, being dipped in reason, but rage and fury <lb/>
            are not invincible but rotten. And so the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            by their pipes turn away the anger of their warriors, and <lb/>
            sacrifice to the Muses before commencing battle, that <lb/>
            reason may abide with them, and when they have routed <lb/>
            a foe do not follow up the victory,3 but relax their rage, <lb/>
            which like small daggers they can easily take back. But <lb/>
            anger kills myriads before it is glutted with revenge, as <lb/>
            happened in the case of Cyrus and Pelopidas the Theban. <lb/>
            But Agathocles bore mildly the revilings of those he was <lb/>
            besieging, and when one of them cried out, " Potter, how <lb/>
            are you going to get money to pay your mercenaries ? ” <lb/>
            be replied laughingly, " Out of your town if I take it." <lb/>
            And when some of those on the wall threw his ugliness <lb/>
            into the teeth of Antigonus, he said to them, " 1 thought I <lb/>
            was rather a handsome fellow." But after be had taken <lb/>
            the town, he sold for slaves those that had flouted him, pro­ <lb/>
            testing that, if they insulted him again, he would bring <lb/>
            the matter before their masters. I have noticed also that <lb/>
            hunters and orators are very unsuccessful when they give <lb/>
            way to anger.4 And Aristotle tells us that the friends of <lb/>
            Satyrus stopped up his ears with wax when he was to plead <lb/>
            a cause, that he might not make any confusion in the case <lb/>
            through rage at the abuse of his enemies. And does <lb/>
            it not frequently happen with ourselves that a slave who <lb/>
            has offended escapes punishment, because they abscond in <lb/>
            fear of our threats and harsh words? What nurses then <lb/>
            say to children, " Give up crying, and you shall have it," <lb/>
            may usefully be applied to anger, thus, " Do not be in a <lb/>
            hurry, or bawl out, or be vehement, and you will sooner <note type="footnote"> 1 Literally “ is silent about." It is like the saying about Von Moltke <lb/>
            that he can be silent in six or seven languages. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Adopting Reiske's reading.</note> <note type="footnote">3 Compare Pausanias, iv. 8. </note><note type="footnote">4 Dübner puts this sentence in brackets. </note> <lb/>

            and better get what you want." For a father, seeing his <lb/>
            boy trying to cut or cleave something with a knife, takes <lb/>
            the knife from him and does it himself: and similarly a <lb/>
            person, taking revenge out of the hand of passion, does <lb/>
            himself safely and usefully and without harm punish the <lb/>
            person who deserves punishment, and not himself instead, <lb/>
            as anger often does.</p>
          <p>§ XI. Now though all the passions need such discipline <lb/>
            as by exercise shall tame and subdue their unreasoning <lb/>
            and disobedient elements, yet there is none which we ought <lb/>
            to keep under by such discipline so much as the exhibition <lb/>
            of anger to our servants. For neither envy, nor fear, nor <lb/>
            rivalry come into play between them and us; but our fre­ <lb/>
            quent displays of anger to them, creating many offences <lb/>
            and faults, make us to slip as if on slippery ground owing <lb/>
            to our autocracy with our servants, which no one resists or <lb/>
            prevents. For it is impossible to check irresponsible power <lb/>
            so as never to break out under the influence of passion, <lb/>
            unless one wields power with much meekness, and refuses <lb/>
            to listen to the frequent complaints of one's wife and <lb/>
            friends charging one with being too easy and lax with one's <lb/>
            servants. And by nothing have I been more exasperated <lb/>
            against them, as if they were being ruined for want of <lb/>
            correction. At last, though late, I got to see that in the first <lb/>
            place it is better to make them worse by forbearance, than by <lb/>
            bitterness and anger to distort oneself for the correction <lb/>
            of others. In the next place I observed that many for the <lb/>
            very reason that they were not corrected were frequently <lb/>
            ashamed to be bad, and made pardon rather than punish­ <lb/>
            ment the commencement of their reformation, aye, and <lb/>
            made better slaves to some merely at their nod silently <lb/>
            and cheerfully than to others with all their beatings and <lb/>
            brandings, and so I came to the conclusion that reason <lb/>
            gets better obeyed than temper, for it is not as the poet said, <lb/>
            " Where there is fear, there too is self-respect," <lb/>
            but it is just the other way about, for self-respect begets that <lb/>
            kind of fear that corrects the behaviour. But perpetual <lb/>
            and pitiless beating produces not so much repentance for <lb/>
            wrong-doing as contrivances to continue in it without <lb/>
            detection. In the third place, ever remembering and re­ <lb/>
             <pb n="280"/>
            fleeting within myself that, just as he that teaches us the <lb/>
            use of the bow does not forbid us to shoot but only to miss <lb/>
            the mark, so it will not prevent punishment altogether to <lb/>
            teach people to do it in season, and with moderation, <lb/>
            utility, and decorum, I strive to remove anger most espe­ <lb/>
            cially by not forbidding those who are to be corrected to <lb/>
            speak in their defence, but by listening to them. For <lb/>
            the interval of time gives a pause to passion, and a delay <lb/>
            that mitigates it, and so judgement finds out both the fit <lb/>
            manner and adequate amount of punishment. Moreover <lb/>
            he that is punished has nothing to allege against his cor­ <lb/>
            rection, if he is punished not in anger but only after his <lb/>
            guilt is brought home to him. And the greatest disgrace <lb/>
            will not be incurred, which is when the servant seems to <lb/>
            speak more justly than the master. As then Phocion, after <lb/>
            the death of Alexander, to stop the Athenians from revolt­ <lb/>
            ing and believing the news too soon, said to them, " Men <lb/>
            of Athens, if he is dead to-day, he will certainly also be <lb/>
            dead to-morrow and the next day," so I think the man <lb/>
            who is in a hurry to punish anyone in his rage ought to <lb/>
            consider with himself, " If this person has wronged you <lb/>
            to-day, he will also have wronged you to-morrow and the <lb/>
            next day; and there will be no harm done if he shall <lb/>
            be punished somewhat late ; whereas if he shall be pun­ <lb/>
            ished at once, he will always seem to you to have been <lb/>
            innocent, as has often happened before now." For which <lb/>
            of us is so savage as to chastise and scourge a slave <lb/>
            because five or ten days before he over-roasted the meat, <lb/>
            or upset the table, or was somewhat tardy on some errand ? <lb/>
            And yet these are the very things for which we put ourselves <lb/>
            out and are harsh and implacable, immediately after they <lb/>
            have happened and are recent. For as bodies seem greater in <lb/>
            a mist, so do little matters in a rage. We ought therefore <lb/>
            to consider such arguments as these at once, and if, when <lb/>
            there is no trace of passion left, the matter appear bad to <lb/>
            calm and clear reason, then it ought to be taken in hand, and <lb/>
            the punishment ought not to be neglected or abandoned, as <lb/>
            we leave food when we have lost our appetites. For <lb/>
            nothing causes people to punish so much when their anger <lb/>
            is fierce, as that when it is appeased they do not punish at <lb/>
            all, but forget the matter entirely, and resemble lazy rowers, <lb/>
             <pb n="281"/>
            who lie in harbour when the sea is calm, and then sail out <lb/>
            to their peril when the wind gets up. So we, condemning <lb/>
            reason for slackness and mildness in punishing, are in a <lb/>
            hurry to punish, borne along by passion as by a dangerous <lb/>
            gale. He that is hungry takes his food as nature dictates, <lb/>
            but he that punishes should have no hunger or thirst for <lb/>
            it, nor require anger as a sauce to stimulate him to it, but <lb/>
            should punish when he is as far as possible from having <lb/>
            any desire for it, and has to compel his reason to it. For <lb/>
            we ought not, as Aristotle tells us slaves in his time were <lb/>
            scourged in Etruria to the music of the flute, to go head­ <lb/>
            long into punishing with a desire and zest for it, and to <lb/>
            delight in punishing, and then afterwards to be sorry at it <lb/>
            -for the first is savage, and the last womanish-but we <lb/>
            should without either sorrow or pleasure chastise at the <lb/>
            dictates of reason, giving anger no opportunity to interfere.</p>
          <p>§ XII. But this perhaps will not appear a cure of anger <lb/>
            so much as a putting away and avoiding such faults as men <lb/>
            commit in anger. And yet, though the swelling of the <lb/>
            spleen is only a symptom of fever, the fever is assuaged by <lb/>
            its abating, as Hieronymus tells us. Now when I contem­ <lb/>
            plated the origin of anger itself, I observed that, though <lb/>
            different persons fell into it for different reasons, yet in <lb/>
            nearly all of them was the idea of their being despised and <lb/>
            neglected to be found. So we ought to help those who try <lb/>
            to get rid of anger, by removing as far as possible from <lb/>
            them any action savouring of contempt or contumely, and <lb/>
            by looking upon their anger as folly or necessity, or emotion, <lb/>
            or mischance, as Sophocles says, <lb/>
            " In those that are unfortunate, 0 king, <lb/>
            No mind stays firm, but all their balance lose.”1 <lb/>
            And so Agamemnon, ascribing to Ate his carrying off <lb/>
            Briseis, yet says to Achilles, <lb/>
            " I wish to please you in return, and give <lb/>
            Completest satisfaction.” a <lb/>
            For suing is not the action of one who shews his contempt, <lb/>
            and when he that has done an injury is humble he removes <note type="footnote"> 1 Sophocles, “Antigone,” 563, 564.</note> <note type="footnote">2 Homer, " Iliad," xix. 138. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="282"/>
            all idea of slighting one. But the angry person must not <lb/>
            expect this, but rather take to himself the answer of <lb/>
            Diogenes, who, when it was said to him, " These people <lb/>
            laugh at you," replied, " But I am not one to be laughed <lb/>
            .at," and not think himself despised, but rather despise the <lb/>
            person who gave the offence, as acting from weakness, or <lb/>
            error, or rashness, or heedlessness, or illiberality, or old <lb/>
            age, or youth. Nor must we entertain such notions with <lb/>
            regard to our servants and friends. For they do not <lb/>
            despise us as void of ability or energy, but owing to our <lb/>
            evenness and good-nature, some because we are mild, and <lb/>
            others presuming on our affection for them. But as it is <lb/>
            we not only fly into rages with wife and slaves and friends, <lb/>
            as if we were slighted by them, but we also frequently, <lb/>
            from forming the same idea of being slighted, fall foul of <lb/>
            innkeepers and sailors and muleteers, and are vexed at <lb/>
            dogs that bark and asses that are in our way: like the <lb/>
            man who was going to beat an ass-driver, but when he <lb/>
            cried out he was an Athenian, he said to the ass, "You are <lb/>
            not an Athenian anyway," and beat it with many stripes.</p>
          <p>§ XIII. Moreover those continuous and frequent fits of <lb/>
            anger that gather together in the soul by degrees, like a <lb/>
            swarm of bees or wasps, are generated within us by selfish­ <lb/>
            ness and peevishness, luxury and softness. And so nothing <lb/>
            causes us to be mild to our servants and wife and friends <lb/>
            so much as easiness and simplicity, and the learning to be <lb/>
            content with what we have, and not to require a quantity <lb/>
            of superfluities. <lb/>
            " He who likes not his meat if over-roast <lb/>
            Or over-boiled, or under-roast or under-boiled, <lb/>
            And never praises it however dressed," <lb/>
            but will not drink unless he have snow to cool his drink, <lb/>
            nor eat bread purchased in the market, nor touch food <lb/>
            served on cheap or earthenware plates, nor sleep upon any <lb/>
            but a feather bed that rises and falls like the sea stirred <lb/>
            up from its depths, and with rods and blows hastens his <lb/>
            servants at table, so that they run about and cry out and <lb/>
            sweat as if they were bringing poultices to sores, be is <lb/>
            slave to a weak querulous and discontented mode of life, <lb/>
            and, like one who has a continual cough or various <lb/>
            ailments, whether he is aware of it or not, he is in an <lb/>
             <pb n="283"/>
            ulcerous and catarrh-like condition as regards his prone­ <lb/>
            ness to anger. We must therefore train the body to con­ <lb/>
            tentment by plain living, that it may be easily satisfied: <lb/>
            for they that require little do not miss much; and it is no <lb/>
            great hardship to begin with our food, and take it silently <lb/>
            whatever it is, and not by being choleric and peevish to <lb/>
            thrust upon ourselves and friends the worst sauce to meat, <lb/>
            anger. <lb/>
            " No more unpleasant supper could there be ” 1 <lb/>
            than that wherein the servants are beaten, and the wife <lb/>
            scolded, because something is burnt or smoked or not salt <lb/>
            enough, or because the bread is too cold. Arcesilaus was <lb/>
            once entertaining some friends and strangers, and when <lb/>
            dinner was served, there was no bread, through the ser­ <lb/>
            vants having neglected to buy any. In such a case as this <lb/>
            which of us would not have broken the walls with vocife­ <lb/>
            ration ? But he only smiled and said, “ How unfit a sage <lb/>
            is to give an entertainment! " And when Socrates once <lb/>
            took Euthydemus home with him from the wrestling- <lb/>
            school, Xanthippe was in a towering rage, and scolded, <lb/>
            and at last upset the table, and Euthydemus rose and went <lb/>
            away full of sorrow. But Socrates said to him, " Did not <lb/>
            a hen at your house the other day fly in and act in the <lb/>
            very same way ? And we did not put ourselves out about <lb/>
            it." We ought to receive our friends with gaiety and <lb/>
            smiles and welcome, not knitting our brows, or inspiring <lb/>
            fear and trembling in the attendants. We ought also to <lb/>
            accustom ourselves to the use of any kind of ware at <lb/>
            table, and not to stint ourselves to one kind rather than <lb/>
            another, as some pick out a particular tankard or horn, as <lb/>
            they say Marius did, out of many, and will not drink out <lb/>
            of anything else; and some act in the same way with <lb/>
            regard to oil-flasks and scrapers,2 being content with only <lb/>
            one out of all, and so, if such an article is broken or lost, <lb/>
            they are very much put out about it, and punish with <lb/>
            severity. He then that is prone to anger should not use <lb/>
            rare and dainty things, such as choice cups and seals and <lb/>
            precious stones: for if they are lost they put a man beside <note type="footnote"> 1 Homer, " Odyssey," xx. 392.</note> <note type="footnote">2 Or strigils. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="284"/>
            himself much more than the loss of ordinary and easily got <lb/>
            things would do. And so when Nero had got an eight-cor­ <lb/>
            nered tent constructed, a wonderful object both for its <lb/>
            beauty and costliness, Seneca said to him, "You have now <lb/>
            shown yourself to be poor, for if you should lose this, you will <lb/>
            not be able to procure such anotber." And indeed it did so <lb/>
            happen that the tent was lost by shipwreck, but Nero bore <lb/>
            its loss patiently, remembering what Seneca had said. <lb/>
            Now this easiness about things generally makes a man also <lb/>
            easy and gentle to his servants, and if to them, then it is <lb/>
            clear he will be so to his friends also, and to all that serve <lb/>
            under him in any capacity. So we observe that newly- <lb/>
            purchased slaves do not inquire about the master who has <lb/>
            bought them, whether he is superstitious or envious, but <lb/>
            only whether he is a bad-tempered man : and generally <lb/>
            speaking we see that neither can men put up with chaste <lb/>
            wives, nor wives with loving husbands, nor friends with <lb/>
            one another, if they be ill-tempered to boot. So neither <lb/>
            marriage nor friendship is bearable with anger, though <lb/>
            without anger even drunkenness is a small matter. For <lb/>
            the wand of Dionysus punishes sufficiently the drunken <lb/>
            man, but if anger be added it turns wine from being the <lb/>
            dispeller of care and inspirer of the dance into a savage <lb/>
            and fury. And simple madness can be cured by Anticyra,1 <lb/>
            but madness mixed with anger is the producer of tragedies <lb/>
            and dreadful narratives.</p>
          <p>§ xiv. So we ought to give anger no vent, either in jest, <lb/>
            for that draws hatred to friendliness; or in discussion, for <lb/>
            that turns love of learning into strife; or on the judge­ <lb/>
            ment-seat, for that adds insolence to power; or in teach­ <lb/>
            ing, for that produces dejection and hatred of learning: or <lb/>
            in prosperity, for that increases envy; or in adversity, for <lb/>
            that deprives people of compassion, when they are peevish <lb/>
            and run counter to those who condole with them, like <lb/>
            Priam, <lb/>
            " A murrain on you, worthless wretches all, <lb/>
            Have you no griefs at home, that here you come <lb/>
            To sympathize with me ? " 2 <note type="footnote"> I Anticyra was famous for its hellebore, which was prescribed in cases <lb/>
            of madness. See Horace, " Satires," ii. 3. 82, 83. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Homer, “ Iliad,- xxiv. 239, 240. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="285"/>
            Good temper on the other hand is useful in some circum­ <lb/>
            stances, adorns and sweetens others, and gets the better of all <lb/>
            peevishness and anger by its gentleness. Thus Euclides,1 <lb/>
            when his brother said to him in a dispute between them, <lb/>
            " May I perish, if I don't have my revenge on you!" re­ <lb/>
            plied, " May I perish, if I don't persuade you ! " and so at <lb/>
            once turned and changed him. And Polemo, when a man <lb/>
            reviled him who was fond of precious stones and quite <lb/>
            crazy for costly seal-rings, made no answer, but bestowed <lb/>
            all his attention on one of his seal-rings, and eyed it <lb/>
            closely; and he being delighted said, “ Do not look at it <lb/>
            so, Polemo, but in the light of the sun, and it will appear <lb/>
            to you more beautiful." And Aristippus, when there was <lb/>
            anger between him and Æschines, and somebody said, “ 0 <lb/>
            Aristippus, where is now your friendship ?" replied, " It is <lb/>
            asleep, but I will wake it up," and went to Æschines, and <lb/>
            said to him, " Do I seem to you so utterly unfortunate and <lb/>
            incurable as to be unworthy of any consideration ? " And <lb/>
            AEschines replied, " It is not at all wonderful that you, <lb/>
            being naturally superior to me in all things, should have <lb/>
            been first to detect in this matter too what was needful." <lb/>
            “For not a woman only, but young child <lb/>
            Tickling the bristly boar with tender hand, <lb/>
            Will lay him prostrate sooner than an athlete." <lb/>
            But we that tame wild beasts and make them gentle, and <lb/>
            carry in our arms young wolves and lions' whelps, incon­ <lb/>
            sistently repel our children and friends and acquaintances in <lb/>
            our rage, and let loose our temper like some wild beast on <lb/>
            our servants and fellow-citizens, speciously trying to dis­ <lb/>
            guise it not rightly under the name of hatred of evil, but <lb/>
            it is, I suppose, as with the other passions and diseases of <lb/>
            the soul, we cannot get rid of any of them by calling one <lb/>
            prudence, and another liberality, and another piety.</p>
          <p>§ xv. And yet, as Zeno said the seed was a mixture and <lb/>
            compound drawn from all the faculties of the soul, so <lb/>
            anger seems a universal seed from all the passions. For it <lb/>
            it is drawn from pain and pleasure and haughtiness, and <lb/>
            from envy it gets its property of malignity-and it is even <note type="footnote"> I A philosopher of Megara, and disciple of Socrates. Compare our <lb/>
            author, " De Fraterno Amore,” § xviii. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="286"/>
            worse than envy,' for it does not mind its own suffering if <lb/>
            it can only implicate another in misery-and the most <lb/>
            unlovely kind of desire is innate in it, namely the appetite <lb/>
            for injuring another. So when we go to the houses of <lb/>
            spendthrifts we hear a flute-playing girl early in the <lb/>
            morning, and see “the dregs of wine," as one said, and frag­ <lb/>
            ments of garlands, and the servants at the doors reeking of <lb/>
            yesterday's debauch; but for tokens of savage and peevish <lb/>
            masters these you will see by the faces, and marks, and <lb/>
            manacles of their servants : for in the house of an angry man <lb/>
            “The only music ever heard is wailing," <lb/>
            stewards being beaten within, and maids tortured, so that <lb/>
            the spectators even in their jollity and pleasure pity these <lb/>
            victims of passion.</p>
          <p>§ xvi. Moreover those to whom it happens through their <lb/>
            genuine hatred of what is bad to be frequently overtaken <lb/>
            by anger, can abate its excess and acerbity by giving up <lb/>
            their excessive confidence in their intimates. For nothing­ <lb/>
            swells the anger more, than when a good man is detected <lb/>
            of villainy, or one who we thought loved us falls out and <lb/>
            jangles with us. As for my own disposition, you know of <lb/>
            course how mightily it inclines to goodwill and belief in <lb/>
            mankind. As then people walking on empty spacer the <lb/>
            more confidently I believe in anybody's affection, the more <lb/>
            sorrow and distress do I feel if my estimate is a mistaken <lb/>
            one. And indeed I could never divest myself of my ardour <lb/>
            and zeal in affection, but as to trusting people I could <lb/>
            perhaps use Plato's caution as a curb. For he said he so <lb/>
            praised Helicon the mathematician, because he was by <lb/>
            nature a changeable animal, but that he was afraid of <lb/>
            those that were well educated in the city, lest, being human <lb/>
            beings and the seed of human beings, they should reveal <lb/>
            by some trait or other the weakness of human nature. But <lb/>
            Sophocles' line, <lb/>
            “Trace out most human acts, you'll find them base," <lb/>
            seems to trample on human nature and lower its merits too <note type="footnote"> 1 So Reiske. Dübner reads <foreign xml:lang="grc">φόβου</foreign>. The MSS. have <foreign xml:lang="grc">φόνου</foreign>, which <lb/>

            much. Still such a peevish and condemnatory verdict as <lb/>
            this has a tendency to make people milder in their rage, <lb/>
            for it is the sudden and unexpected that makes people go <lb/>
            distracted. And we ought, as Panætius somewhere said, <lb/>
            to imitate Anaxagoras, and as he said at the death of his <lb/>
            son, "I knew that I had begotten a mortal," so ought <lb/>
            every one of us to use the following kind of language in <lb/>
            those contretemps that stir up our anger, " I knew that <lb/>
            the slave I bought was not a philosopher," " I knew that <lb/>
            the friend I had was not perfect," " I knew that my wife <lb/>
            was but a woman." And if anyone would also constantly <lb/>
            put to himself that question of Plato, " Am I myself all <lb/>
            I should be ? " and look at home instead of abroad, and <lb/>
            curb his propensity to censoriousness, he would not be so <lb/>
            keen to detect evil in others, for he would see that he stood <lb/>
            in need of much allowance himself. But now each of us, <lb/>
            when angry and punishing, quote the words of Aristides <lb/>
            and Cato, " Do not steal, Do not tell lies," and " Why are <lb/>
            you lazy?" And, what is most disgraceful of all, we <lb/>
            blame angry people when we are angry ourselves, and <lb/>
            chastise in temper faults that were committed in temper, <lb/>
            unlike the doctors who <lb/>
            " With bitter physic purge the bitter bile," <lb/>
            for we rather increase and aggravate the disease. When­ <lb/>
            ever then I busy myself with such considerations as these, <lb/>
            I try also to curtail my curiosity. For to scrutinize and <lb/>
            pry into everything too minutely, and to overhaul every <lb/>
            business of a servant, or action of a friend, or pastime of a <lb/>
            son, or whisper of a wife, produces frequent, indeed daily, <lb/>
            fits of anger, caused entirely by peevishness and harshness <lb/>
            of character. Euripides says that the Deity <lb/>
            " In great things intervenes, but small things leaves <lb/>
            To fortune; ” 1 <lb/>
            but I am of opinion that a prudent man should commit <lb/>
            nothing to fortune, nor neglect anything, but should put <lb/>
            some things in his wife's hands to manage, others in the <note type="footnote"> I Horace, remembering these lines no doubt, says “De Arte Poetical <lb/>
            191, 192, <lb/>

            Incident.” </note> <lb/>

            hands of his servants, others in the hands of his friends, <lb/>
            (as a governor has his stewards, and financiers, and con­ <lb/>
            trollers), while he himself superintends the most important <lb/>
            and weighty matters. For as small writing strains the <lb/>
            eyes, so small matters even more strain and bother people, <lb/>
            and stir up their anger, which carries this evil habit to <lb/>
            greater matters. Above all I thought that saying of <lb/>
            Empedocles, " Fast from evil,” 1 a great and divine one, <lb/>
            and I approved of those promises and vows as not un­ <lb/>
            graceful or unphilosophical, to abstain for a year from wine <lb/>
            and Venus, honouring the deity by continence, or for a <lb/>
            stated time to give up lying, taking great heed to ourselves <lb/>
            to be truthful always whether in play or earnest. With <lb/>
            these I compared my own vow, as no less pleasing to the <lb/>
            gods and holy, first to abstain from anger for a few days, like <lb/>
            spending days without drunkenness or even without wine <lb/>
            at all, offering as it were wineless offerings of honey.2 Then <lb/>
            I tried for a month or two, and so in time made some pro­ <lb/>
            gress in forbearance by earnest resolve, and by keeping <lb/>
            myself courteous and without anger and using fair lan­ <lb/>
            guage, purifying myself from evil words and absurd <lb/>
            actions, and from passion which for a little unlovely plea­ <lb/>
            sure pays us with great mental disturbance and the bit­ <lb/>
            terest repentance. In consequence of all this my expe­ <lb/>
            rience, and the assistance of the deity, has made me form <lb/>
            the view, that courtesy and gentleness and kindliness are <lb/>
            not so agreeable, and pleasant, and delightful, to any of <lb/>
            those we live with as to ourselves, that have those qualities.3 <note type="footnote"> 1 It is quite likely that the delicious poet Robert Herrick borrowed <lb/>

          <p>§ i. IT was late when I received your letter, asking me <lb/>
            to write to you something on contentedness of mind, and <lb/>
            on those things in the Timens that require an accurate <lb/>
            explanation. And it so fell out that at that very time our <lb/>
            friend Eros was obliged to set sail at once for Rome, <lb/>
            having received a letter from the excellent Fundanus, <lb/>
            urging haste according to his wont. And not having as <lb/>
            much time as I could have wished to meet your request, <lb/>
            and yet not thinking for one moment of letting my messen­ <lb/>
            ger go to you entirely empty-handed, I copied out the notes <lb/>
            that I had chanced to make on contentedness of mind. For <lb/>
            I thought that you did not desire this discourse merely to <lb/>
            be treated to a subject handled in fine style, but for the <lb/>
            real business of life. And I congratulate you that, though <lb/>
            you have friendships with princes, and have as much <lb/>
            forensic reputation as anybody, yet you are not in the <lb/>
            same plight as the tragic Merops, nor have you like him <lb/>
            by the felicitations of the multitude been induced to forget <lb/>
            the sufferings of humanity; but you remember, what you <lb/>
            have often heard, that a patrician's slipper2 is no cure for <lb/>
            the gout, nor a costly ring for a whitlow, nor a diadem for <lb/>
            the headache. For how can richeR, or fame, or power at <lb/>
            court help us to ease of mind or a calm life, unless we enjoy <lb/>
            them when present, but are not for ever pining after them <lb/>
            when absent ? And what else causes this but the long exer­ <lb/>
            cise and practice of reason, which, when the unreasoning and <lb/>
            emotional part of the soul breaks out of bounds, curbs it <lb/>
            quickly, and does not allow it to be carried away headlong <lb/>
            from its actual position ? And as Xenophon' advised that <lb/>
            we should remember and honour the gods most especially <lb/>
            in prosperity, that so, when we should be in any strait, we <lb/>
            might confidently call upon them as already our well- <note type="footnote"> 1 Or cheerfulness, or tranquillity of mind. Jeremy Taylor has <lb/>

            wishers and friends; so sensible men would do well before <lb/>
            trouble comes to meditate on remedies how to bear it, <lb/>
            that they may be the more efficacious from being ready for <lb/>
            use long before. For as savage dogs are excited at every <lb/>
            sound, and are only soothed by a familiar voice, so also it <lb/>
            is not easy to quiet the wild passions of the soul, unless <lb/>
            familiar and well-known arguments be at hand to check its <lb/>
            excitement.</p>
          <p>§ 11. He then that said, that the man that wished to have <lb/>
            an easy mind ought to have little to do either public or <lb/>
            private, first of all makes ease of mind a very costly article <lb/>
            for us, if it is to be bought at the price of doing nothing, as <lb/>
            if he should advise every sick person, <lb/>
            “ Lie still, poor wretch, in bed.” 1 <lb/>
            And indeed stupor is a bad remedy for the body against <lb/>
            despair,2 nor is he any better physician of the soul who <lb/>
            removes its trouble and anxiety by recommending a lazy <lb/>
            and soft life and a leaving our friends and relations and <lb/>
            country in the lurch. In the next place, it is false that <lb/>
            those that have little to do are easy in mind. For then <lb/>
            women would be easier in mind than men, since they <lb/>
            mostly stay at home in inactivity, and even now-a-days it <lb/>
            is as Hesiod says,3 <lb/>
            " The North Wind comes not near a soft-skinned maiden;" <lb/>
            yet griefs and troubles and unrest, proceeding from jealousy <lb/>
            or superstition or ambition or vanity, inundate the women's <lb/>
            part of the house with unceasing flow. And Laertes, <lb/>
            though he lived for twenty years a solitary life in the <lb/>
            country, <lb/>
            " With an old woman to attend on him, <lb/>
            Who duly set on board his meat and drink,”4 <lb/>
            and fled from his country and house and kingdom, yet had <lb/>
            sorrow and dejection5 as a perpetual companion with leisure. <lb/>
            And some have been often thrown into sad unrest merely <lb/>
            from inaction, as the following, <lb/>
            “But fleet Achilles, Zeus-sprung, son of Peleus, <lb/>
            Sat by the swiftly-sailing ships and fumed, <note type="footnote"> 1 Euripides, " Orestes," 258. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 So Wyttenbach, Diibner.

            Nor ever did frequent th' ennobling council, <lb/>
            Nor ever join the war, but pined in heart, <lb/>
            Though in his tent abiding, for the fray." I <lb/>
            And full of emotion and distress at this state of things lie <lb/>
            himself says, <lb/>
            “A useless burden to the earth I sit <lb/>
            Beside the ships.”2 <lb/>
            So even Epicurus thinks that those who are desirous of <lb/>
            honour and glory should not rust in inglorious ease, but <lb/>
            use their natural talents in public life for the benefit of the <lb/>
            community at large, seeing that they are by nature so con­ <lb/>
            stituted that they would be more likely to be troubled and <lb/>
            afflicted at inaction, if they did not get what they desired. <lb/>
            But he is absurd in that he does not urge men of ability to <lb/>
            take part in public life, but only the restless. But we <lb/>
            ought not to estimate ease or unrest of mind by our many <lb/>
            or few actions, but by their fairness or foulness. For the <lb/>
            omission of fair actions troubles and distresses us, as I have <lb/>
            said before, quite as much as the actual doing of foul <lb/>
            actions.</p>
          <p>§ III. As for those who think that one kind of life is <lb/>
            especially free from trouble, as some think that of farmers, <lb/>
            others that of bachelors, others that of kings, Menander <lb/>
            sufficiently exposes their error in the following lines: <lb/>
            " Phania, I thought those rich who need not borrow, <lb/>
            Nor groan at nights, nor cry out' Woo is me,' <lb/>
            Kicked up and down in this untoward world, <lb/>
            But sweet and gentle sleep they may enjoy." <lb/>
            He then goes on to remark that he saw the rich suffering <lb/>
            the same as the poor, <lb/>
            " Trouble and life are truly near akin. <lb/>
            With the luxurious or the glorious life <lb/>
            Trouble consorts, and in the life of poverty <lb/>
            Lasts with it to the end." <lb/>
            But just as people on the sea, timid and prone to sea-sickness, <lb/>
            think they will suffer from it less on board a merchantman <lb/>
            than on a boat, and for the same reason shift their quarters <lb/>
            to a trireme, but do not attain anything by these changes, <lb/>
            for they take with them their timidity and qualmishness, <lb/>
            so changes of life do not remove the sorrows and troubles <note type="footnote"> 1 “Iliad,” i. 488-492.</note> <note type="footnote">2 “Iliad,” xviii. 104. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="292"/>
            of the soul; which proceed from want of experience and <lb/>
            reflection, and from inability or ignorance rightly to enjoy <lb/>
            the present. These afflict the rich as well as the poor ; <lb/>
            these trouble the married as well as the unmarried; these <lb/>
            make people shun the forum, but find no happiness in <lb/>
            retirement; these make people eagerly desire introductions <lb/>
            at court, though when got they straightway care no more <lb/>
            about them. <lb/>
            “The sick are peevish in their straits and needs.” 1 <lb/>
            For the wife bothers them, and they grumble at the doctor, <lb/>
            and they find the bed uneasy, and, as Ion says, <lb/>
            " The friend that visits them tires their patience, <lb/>
            And yet they do not like him to depart." <lb/>
            But afterwards, when the illness is over, and a sounder <lb/>
            condition supervenes, health returns and makes all things <lb/>
            pleasant and acceptable. He that yesterday loathed eggs <lb/>
            and cakes of finest meal and purest bread will to-day eat <lb/>
            eagerly and with appetite coarsest bread with a few olives <lb/>
            and cress.</p>
          <p>§ iv. Such contentedness and change of view in regard <lb/>
            to every kind of life does the infusion of reason bring about. <lb/>
            When Alexander heard from Anaxarchus of the infinite <lb/>
            number of worlds, he wept, and when his friends asked him <lb/>
            what was the matter, he replied, " Is it not a matter for <lb/>
            tears that, when the number of worlds is infinite, I have <lb/>
            not conquered one ? " But Crates, who had only a wallet <lb/>
            and threadbare cloak, passed all his life jesting and laugh­ <lb/>
            ing as if at a festival. Agamemnon was troubled with his <lb/>
            rule over so many subjects, <lb/>
            “You look on Agamemnon, Atreus* son, <lb/>
            Whom Zeus has plunged for ever in a mass <lb/>
            Of never-ending cares." 2 <lb/>
            But Diogenes when he was being sold sat down and kept <lb/>
            jeering at the auctioneer, and would not stand up when he <lb/>
            bade him, but said joking and laughing, " Would you tell <lb/>
            a fish you were selling to stand up?" And Socrates in <lb/>
            prison played the philosopher and discoursed with his <note type="footnote"> 1 Euripides, " Orestes," 232.</note> <note type="footnote">2 Homer, " Iliad," x. 88, 89. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="293"/>
            friends. But Phäethon,1 when he got up to heaven, wept <lb/>
            because nobody gave to him his father's horses and chariot. <lb/>
            As therefore the shoe is shaped by the foot, and not the <lb/>
            foot by the shoe, so does the disposition make the life <lb/>
            similar to itself. For it is not, as one said, custom that <lb/>
            makes the best life seem sweet to those that choose it, but <lb/>
            it is sense that makes that very life at once the best and <lb/>
            sweetest. Let us cleanse therefore the fountain of con­ <lb/>
            tentedness, which is within us, that so external things may <lb/>
            turn out for our good, through our putting the best face on <lb/>
            them. <lb/>
            " Events will take their course, it is no good <lb/>
            Our being angry at them, he is happiest <lb/>
            Who wisely turns them to the best account." 2</p>
          <p>§ v. Plato compared human life to a game at dice, <lb/>
            wherein we ought to throw according to our requirements, <lb/>
            and, having thrown, to make the best use of whatever <lb/>
            turns up. It is not in our power indeed to determine what <lb/>
            the throw will be, but it is our part, if we are wise, to <lb/>
            accept in a right spirit whatever fortune sends, and so to con­ <lb/>
            trive matters that what we wish should do us most good, <lb/>
            and what we do not wish should do us least harm. For <lb/>
            those who live at random and without judgement, like <lb/>
            those sickly people who can stand neither heat nor cold, are <lb/>
            unduly elated by prosperity, and cast down by adversity; <lb/>
            and in either case suffer from unrest, but 'tis their own <lb/>
            fault, and perhaps they suffer most in what are called <lb/>
            good circumstances. Theodorus, who was surnamed the <lb/>
            Atheist, used to say that he held out arguments with his <lb/>
            right hand, but his hearers received them with their left; <lb/>
            so awkward people frequently take in a clumsy manner the <lb/>
            favours of fortune; but men of sense, as bees extract <lb/>
            honey from thyme which is the strongest and driest of <lb/>
            herbs,3 so from the least auspicious circumstances fre­ <lb/>
            quently derive advantage and profit.</p>
          <p>§ VI. We ought then to cultivate such a habit as this, <note type="footnote"> 1 The story of Phäethon is a very well-known one, and is recorded <lb/>
            very fully by Ovid in the " Metamorphoses," Book ii. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Euripides, “Bellerophon.” Fragm. 298. </note><note type="footnote"> a Supplying <foreign xml:lang="grc">φυτω̃ν</foreign> with Reiske. </note> <lb/>

            like the man who threw a stone at his dog, and missed it, <lb/>
            but hit his step-mother, and cried out, " Not so bad." <lb/>
            Thus we may often turn the edge of fortune when things <lb/>
            turn not out as we wish. Diogenes was driven into exile; <lb/>
            “not so bad;” for his exile made him turn philosopher. <lb/>
            And Zeno of Cittium,' when he heard that the only mer­ <lb/>
            chantman he had was wrecked, cargo and all, said, " For­ <lb/>
            tune, you treat me handsomely, since you reduce me to my <lb/>
            threadbare cloak and piazza.” 2 What prevents our imitating <lb/>
            such men as these ? Have you failed to get some office ? <lb/>
            You will be able to live in the country henceforth, and <lb/>
            manage your own affairs. Did you court the friendship of <lb/>
            some great man, and meet with a rebuff ? You will live <lb/>
            free from danger and cares. Have you again had matters to <lb/>
            deal with that required labour and thought ? " Warm water <lb/>
            will not so much make the limbs soft by soaking," to quote <lb/>
            Pindar,3 as glory and honour and power make "labour sweet, <lb/>
            and toil to be no toil.“ 4 Or has any bad luck or con­ <lb/>
            tumely fallen on you in consequence of some calumny or <lb/>
            from envy ? The breeze is favourable that will waft you <lb/>
            to the Muses and the Academy, as it did Plato when his <lb/>
            friendship with Dionysius came to an end. It does indeed <lb/>
            greatly conduce to contentedness of mind to see how <lb/>
            famous men have borne the same troubles with an unruffled <lb/>
            mind. For example, does childlessness trouble you ? Con­ <lb/>
            sider those kings of the Romans, none of whom left his <lb/>
            kingdom to a son. Are you distressed at the pinch of <lb/>
            poverty ? Who of the Bœotians would you rather prefer <lb/>
            to be than Epaminondas, or of the Romans than Fabri­ <lb/>
            cius ? Has your wife been seduced ? Have you never <lb/>
            read that inscription at Delphi, <lb/>
            “Agis the king of land and sea erected me; ” <lb/>
            and have you not heard that his wife Timæa was seduced <lb/>
            by Alcibiades, and in her whispers to her handmaidens <lb/>
            called the child that was born Alcibiades ? Yet this did <lb/>
            not prevent Agis from being the most famous and greatest <note type="footnote"> 1 In Cyprus. Zeno was the founder of the Stoics. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Zeno and his successors taught in the Piazza at Athens called the <lb/>

            of the Greeks. Neither again did the licentiousness of his <lb/>
            daughter prevent Stilpo from leading the merriest life of <lb/>
            all the philosophers that were his contemporaries. And <lb/>
            when Metrocles reproached him with her life, he said, " Is it <lb/>
            my fault or hers ? " And when Metrocles answered, " Her <lb/>
            fault, but your misfortune,” he rejoined, " How say you? <lb/>
            Are not faults also slips ? " " Certainly," said he. " And <lb/>
            are not slips mischances in those matters wherein we <lb/>
            slip ? " Metrocles assented. " And are not mischances <lb/>
            misfortunes in those matters wherein we mischance ? " By <lb/>
            this gentle and philosophical argument he demonstrated <lb/>
            the Cynic's reproach to be an idle bark.</p>
          <p>§ VII. But most people are troubled and exasperated not <lb/>
            only at the bad in their friends and intimates, but also in <lb/>
            their enemies. For railing and anger and envy and malig­ <lb/>
            nity and jealousy and ill-will are the bane of those that <lb/>
            suffer from those infirmities, and trouble and exasperate <lb/>
            the foolish : as for example the quarrels of neighbours, and <lb/>
            peevishness of acquaintances, and the want of ability in <lb/>
            those that manage state affairs. By these things you your­ <lb/>
            self seem to me to be put out not a little, as the doctors in <lb/>
            Sophocles, who <lb/>
            " With bitter physic purge the bitter bile,” 1 <lb/>
            so vexed and bitter are you at people's weaknesses and <lb/>
            infirmities, which is not reasonable in you. Even your <lb/>
            own private affairs are not always managed by simple and <lb/>
            good and suitable instruments, so to speak, but very fre­ <lb/>
            quently by sharp and crooked ones. Do not think it then <lb/>
            either your business, or an easy matter either, to set all <lb/>
            these things to rights. But if you take people as they are, <lb/>
            as the surgeon uses his bandages and instruments for draw­ <lb/>
            ing teeth, and with cheerfulness and serenity welcome all <lb/>
            that happens, as you would look upon barking dogs as only <lb/>
            following their nature, you will be happier in the disposi­ <lb/>
            tion you will then have than you will be distressed at other <lb/>
            people's disagreeableness and shortcomings. For you will <lb/>
            forget to make a collection of disagreeable things,2 which <note type="footnote"> I Quoted again by our author " On Restraining Anger," § xvi. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 As will be seen, I follow Wyttenbach's guidance in this very corrupt <lb/>
            passage, which is a true crux. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="296"/>
            now inundate, as some hollow and low-lying ground, your <lb/>
            littleness of mind and weakness, which fills itself with <lb/>
            other people's bad points. For seeing that some of the <lb/>
            philosophers censure compassion to the unfortunate (on <lb/>
            the ground that it is good to help our neighbours, and not <lb/>
            to give way to sentimental sympathy in connection with <lb/>
            them), and, what is of more importance, do not allow those <lb/>
            that are conscious of their errors and bad moral disposition <lb/>
            to be dejected and grieved at them, but bid them cure their <lb/>
            defects without grief at once, is it not altogether unrea­ <lb/>
            sonable, look you, to allow ourselves to be peevish and <lb/>
            vexed, because all those who have dealings with us and <lb/>
            come near us are not good and clever ? Let us see to it, <lb/>
            dear Paccius, that we do not, whether we are aware of it <lb/>
            or not, play a part, really looking1 not at the universal <lb/>
            defects of those that approach us, but at our own interests <lb/>
            through our selfishness, and not through our hatred of evil. <lb/>
            For excessive excitement about things, and an undue appe­ <lb/>
            tite and desire for them, or on the other hand aversion and <lb/>
            dislike to them, engender suspiciousness and peevishness <lb/>
            against persons, who were, we think, the cause of our being <lb/>
            deprived of some things, and of being troubled with others. <lb/>
            But he that is accustomed to adapt himself to things easily <lb/>
            and calmly is most cheerful and gentle in his dealings with <lb/>
            people.</p>
          <p>§ vir. Wherefore let us resume our argument. As in a <lb/>
            fever everything seems bitter and unpleasant to the taste, <lb/>
            but when we see others not loathing but fancying the very <lb/>
            same eatables and drinkables, we no longer find the fault <lb/>
            to be in them but in ourselves and our disease, so we shall <lb/>
            cease to blame and be discontented with the state of affairs, <lb/>
            if we see others cheerfully and without grief enduring the <lb/>
            same. It also makes for contentedness, when things <lb/>
            happen against our wish, not to overlook our many advan­ <lb/>
            tages and comforts, but by looking at both good and bad <lb/>
            to feel that the good preponderate. When our eyes are <lb/>
            dazzled with things too bright we turn them away, and ease <lb/>
            them by looking at flowers or grass, while we keep the eyes <lb/>
            of our mind strained on disagreeable things, and force <note type="footnote"> 1 Reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεδορκότες</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="297"/>
            them to dwell on bitter ideas, well-nigh tearing them away <lb/>
            by force from the consideration of pleasanter things. And <lb/>
            yet one might apply here, not unaptly, what was said to <lb/>
            the man of curiosity, 1 <lb/>
            “Malignant wretch, why art so keen to mark <lb/>
            Thy neighbour's fault, and seest not thine own ? ” <lb/>
            Why on earth, my good sir, do you confine your view to <lb/>
            your troubles, making them so vivid and acute, while you <lb/>
            do not let your mind dwell at all on your present com­ <lb/>
            forts ? But as cupping-glasses draw the worst blood from <lb/>
            the flesh, so you force upon your attention the worst things <lb/>
            in your lot: acting not a whit more wisely than that <lb/>
            Chian, who, selling much choice wine to others, asked for <lb/>
            some sour wine for his own supper; and one of his slaves <lb/>
            being asked by another, what he had left his master doing, <lb/>
            replied, "Asking for bad when good was by." For most <lb/>
            people overlook the advantages and pleasures of their <lb/>
            individual lives, and run to their difficulties and grievances. <lb/>
            Aristippus, however, was not such a one, for he cleverly <lb/>
            knew as in a scale to make the better preponderate over <lb/>
            the worse. So having lost a good farm, he asked one of <lb/>
            those who made a great show of condolence and sympathy, <lb/>
            "Have you not only one little piece of ground, while I <lb/>
            have three fields left P ” And when he admitted that it was <lb/>
            so, he went on to say, “Ought I not then to condole with <lb/>
            you rather than you with me?" For it is the act of a <lb/>
            madman to distress oneself over what is lost, and not to <lb/>
            rejoice at what is left; but like little children, if one of <lb/>
            their many playthings be taken away by anyone, throw the <lb/>
            rest away and weep and cry out, so we, if we are assailed <lb/>
            by fortune in some one point, wail and mourn and make all <lb/>
            other things seem unprofitable in our eyes.</p>
          <p>§ IX. Suppose someone should say, What blessings have <lb/>
            we ? I would reply, What have we not ? One has reputa­ <lb/>
            tion, another a house, another a wife, another a good <lb/>
            friend. When Antipater of Tarsus was reckoning up on <lb/>
            his death-bed his various pieces of good fortune, he did not <note type="footnote"> I See " On Curiosity," § i. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="298"/>
            even pass over his favourable voyage from Cilicia to Athens. <lb/>
            So we should not overlook, but take account of every­ <lb/>
            day blessings, and rejoice that we live, and are well, and <lb/>
            see the sun, and that no war or sedition plagues our coun­ <lb/>
            try, but that the earth is open to cultivation, the sea secure <lb/>
            to mariners, and that we can speak or be silent, lead a <lb/>
            busy or an idle life, as we choose. We shall get more con­ <lb/>
            tentedness from the presence of all these blessings, if we <lb/>
            fancy them as absent, and remember from time to time <lb/>
            how people ill yearn for health, and people in war for <lb/>
            peace, and strangers and unknown in a great city for repu­ <lb/>
            tation and friends, and how painful it is to be deprived of <lb/>
            all these when one has once had them. For then each of <lb/>
            these blessings will not appear to us only great and <lb/>
            valuable when it is lost, and of no value while we have it. <lb/>
            For not having it cannot add value to anything. Nor <lb/>
            ought we to amass things we regard as valuable, and <lb/>
            always be on the tremble and afraid of losing them as <lb/>
            valuable things, and yet, when we have them, ignore them <lb/>
            and think little of them; but we ought to use them for <lb/>
            our pleasure and enjoyment, that we may bear their loss, <lb/>
            if that should happen, with more equanimity. But most <lb/>
            people, as Arcesilans said, think it right to inspect <lb/>
            minutely and in every detail, perusing them alike with the <lb/>
            eyes of the body and mind, other people's poems and <lb/>
            paintings and statues, while they neglect to study their <lb/>
            own lives, which have often many not unpleasing subjects <lb/>
            for contemplation, looking abroad and ever admiring other <lb/>
            people's reputations and fortunes, as adulterers admire <lb/>
            other men's wives, and think cheap of their own.</p>
          <p>§ x. And yet it makes much for contentedness of mind <lb/>
            to look for the most part at home and to our own condi­ <lb/>
            tion, or if not, to look at the case of people worse off than <lb/>
            ourselves, and not, as most people do, to compare ourselves I <lb/>
            with those who are better off. For example, those who are <lb/>
            in chains think those happy who are freed from their chains, <lb/>
            and they again freemen, and freemen citizens, and they <lb/>
            again the rich, and the rich satraps, and satraps kings, and <lb/>
            kings the gods, content with hardly anything short of <lb/>
            hurling thunderbolts and lightning. And so they ever <lb/>
             <pb n="299"/>
            want something above them, and are never thankful for <lb/>
            what they have. <lb/>
            " I care not for the wealth of golden Gyges," <lb/>
            and, <lb/>
            " I never had or envy or desire <lb/>
            To be a god, or love for mighty empire, <lb/>
            Far distant from my eyes are all such things." <lb/>
            But this, you will say, was the language of a Thasian. <lb/>
            But you will find others, Chians or Galatians or Bithy­ <lb/>
            nians, not content with the share of glory or power they <lb/>
            have among their fellow-citizens, but weeping because <lb/>
            they do not wear senators' shoes; or, if they have them, <lb/>
            that they cannot be prætors at Rome; or, if they get that <lb/>
            office, that they are not consuls; or, if they are consuls, <lb/>
            that they are only proclaimed second and not first. What <lb/>
            is all this but seeking out excuses for being unthankful to <lb/>
            fortune, only to torment and punish oneself ? But he that <lb/>
            has a mind in sound condition, does not sit down in <lb/>
            sorrow and dejection if he is less renowned or rich than <lb/>
            some of the countless myriads of mankind that the sun <lb/>
            looks upon, " who feed on the produce of the wide world,” 1 <lb/>
            but goes on his way rejoicing at his fortune and life, <lb/>
            as far fairer and happier than that of myriads of others. <lb/>
            In the Olympian games it is not possible to be the victor <lb/>
            by choosing one's competitors. But in the race of life <lb/>
            circumstances allow us to plume ourselves on surpassing <lb/>
            many, and to be objects of envy rather than to have to <lb/>
            envy others, unless we pit ourselves against a Briareus or <lb/>
            a Hercules. Whenever then you admire anyone carried <lb/>
            by in his litter as a greater man than yourself, lower your <lb/>
            eyes and look at those that bear the litter. And when you <lb/>
            think the famous Xerxes happy for his passage over the <lb/>
            Hellespont, as a native of those parts 2 did, look too at <lb/>
            those who dug through Mount Athos under the lash, and <lb/>
            at those whose ears and noses were cut off because the <lb/>
            bridge was broken by the waves, consider their state of <lb/>
            mind also, for they think your life and fortunes happy. <lb/>
            Socrates, when he heard one of his friends saying, " How <note type="footnote"> 1 Simonids.</note> <note type="footnote">2 See Herodutus, vii. 56. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="300"/>
            dear this city is! Chian wine costs one mina,l a purple <lb/>
            robe three, and half a pint of honey five drachmae," took <lb/>
            him to the meal market, and showed him half a peck of <lb/>
            meal for an obol, then took him to the olive market, and <lb/>
            showed him a peck of olives for two coppers, and lastly <lb/>
            showed him that a sleeveless vest2 was only ten drachmae. <lb/>
            At each place Socrates' friend exclaimed, " How cheap this <lb/>
            city is !" So also we, when we hear anyone saying that <lb/>
            our affairs are bad and in a woful plight, because we are <lb/>
            not consuls or governors, may reply, " Our affairs are in <lb/>
            an admirable condition, and our life an enviable one, seeing <lb/>
            that we do not beg, nor carry burdens, nor live by flattery."</p>
          <p>§ xi. But since through our folly we are accustomed to <lb/>
            live more with an eye to others than ourselves, and since <lb/>
            nature is so jealous and envious that it rejoices not so <lb/>
            much in its own blessings as it is pained by those of others, <lb/>
            do not look only at the much-cried-up splendour of those <lb/>
            whom you envy and admire, but open and draw, as it were, <lb/>
            the gaudy curtain of their pomp and show, and peep <lb/>
            within, you will see that they have much to trouble them, <lb/>
            and many things to annoy them. The well-known Pit­ <lb/>
            tacus,3 whose fame was so great for fortitude and wisdom <lb/>
            and uprightness, was once entertaining some guests, and <lb/>
            his wife came in in a rage and upset the table, and as the <lb/>
            guests were dismayed he said, Every one of you has some <lb/>
            trouble, and he who has mine only is not so bad off. <lb/>
            " Happy is he accounted at the forum. <lb/>
            But when he opes the door of his own house <lb/>
            Thrice miserable; for his wife rules all, <lb/>
            Still lords it over him, and is ever quarrelling. <lb/>
            Many griefs has he that I wot not of." <lb/>
            Many such cases are there, unknown to the public, for <lb/>
            family pride casts a veil over them, to be found in wealth <lb/>
            and glory and even in royalty. <lb/>
            " 0 happy son of Atreus, child of destiny, <lb/>
            Blessed thy lot; " 4 <lb/>
            congratulation like this comes from an external view, from <lb/>
            a halo of arms and horses and the pomp of war, but the <lb/>
            inward voice of emotion testifies against all this vain glory ; <note type="footnote"> 1 A mina was 100 drachmae (i.e. £4. Is. 3d.), and 600 obols. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 A slave's ordinary dress.</note> <note type="footnote">3 One of the Seven Wise Men.</note> <note type="footnote"> 3 Homer, “Iliad," iii. 182. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="301"/>
            " A heavy fate is laid on me by Zeus <lb/>
            The son of Cronos.” 1 <lb/>
            And, <lb/>
            “Old man, I think your lot one to be envied, <lb/>
            As that of any man who free from danger <lb/>
            Passes his life unknown and in obscurity." 2 <lb/>
            By such reflections as these one may wean oneself from <lb/>
            that discontent with one's fortune, which makes one's own <lb/>
            condition look low and mean from too much admiring one'a <lb/>
            neighbour's.</p>
          <p>§ XII. Another thing, which is a great hindrance to peace <lb/>
            of mind, is not to proportion our desires to our means, but <lb/>
            to carry too much sail, as it were, in our hopes of great <lb/>
            things and then, if unsuccessful, to blame destiny and for­ <lb/>
            tune, and not our own folly. For he is not unfortunate <lb/>
            who wishes to shoot with a plough, or hunt the hare with <lb/>
            an ox; nor has he an evil genius opposed to him, who does <lb/>
            not catch deer with fishing nets, but merely is the dupe <lb/>
            of his own stupidity and folly in attempting impossi­ <lb/>
            bilities. Self-love is mainly to blame, making people fond <lb/>
            of being first and aspiring in all matters, and insatiably <lb/>
            desirous to engage in everything. For people not only <lb/>
            wish at one and the same time to be rich, and learned, and <lb/>
            strong, and boon-companions, and agreeable, and friends of <lb/>
            kings, and governors of cities, but they are also discon­ <lb/>
            tented if they have not dogs and horses and quails and <lb/>
            cocks of the first quality. Dionysius the elder was not <lb/>
            content with being the most powerful monarch of his times, <lb/>
            but because he could not beat Philoxenus the poet in singing, <lb/>
            or surpass Plato in dialectics, was so angry and exasperated <lb/>
            that he put the one to work in his stone quarries, and sent <lb/>
            the other to Ægina and sold him there. Alexander was of <lb/>
            a different spirit, for when Crisso the famous runner ran <lb/>
            a race with him, and seemed to let the king outrun him <lb/>
            on purpose, he was greatly displeased. Good also was <lb/>
            the spirit of Achilles in Homer, who, when he said, <lb/>
            " None of the Achaean warriors is a match <lb/>
            For me in war," <lb/>
            I <note type="footnote"> 1 Homer, "Iliad," ii. 111. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Words of Agamemnon to the House Porter. Euripides, Iphigenia <lb/>
            in Aulis," 17-19. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="302"/>
            added, <lb/>
            " Yet in the council hall <lb/>
            Others there are who better are than me.” 1 <lb/>
            And when Megabyzus the Persian visited the studio of <lb/>
            Apelles, and began to chatter about art, Apelles stopped <lb/>
            him and said, " While you kept silence you seemed to be <lb/>
            somebody from your gold and purple, but now these lads <lb/>
            that are grinding colours are laughing at your nonsense." <lb/>
            But some who think the Stoics only talk idly, in styling <lb/>
            their wise man not only prudent and just and brave but also <lb/>
            orator and general and poet and rich man and king, yet claim <lb/>
            for themselves all those titles, and are indignant if they do <lb/>
            not get them. And yet even among the gods different func­ <lb/>
            tions are assigned to different personages ; thus one is called <lb/>
            the god of war, another the god of oracles, another the god <lb/>
            of gain, and Aphrodite, as she has nothing to do with war­ <lb/>
            like affairs, is despatched by Zeus to marriages and bridals.</p>
          <p>§ XIII. And indeed there are some pursuits which cannot <lb/>
            exist together, but are by their very nature opposed. For <lb/>
            example oratory and the study of the mathematics require <lb/>
            ease and leisure; whereas political ability and the friend­ <lb/>
            ship of kings cannot be attained without mixing in affairs <lb/>
            and in public life. Moreover wine and indulgence in meat <lb/>
            make the body indeed strong and vigorous, but blunt the <lb/>
            intellect; and though unremitting attention to making and <lb/>
            saving money will heap up wealth, yet despising and con­ <lb/>
            temning riches is a great help to philosophy. So that all <lb/>
            things are not within any one's power, and we must obey <lb/>
            that saying inscribed in the temple of Apollo at Delphi, <lb/>
            Know thyself, 2 and adapt ourselves to our natural bent, and <lb/>
            not drag and force nature to some other kind of life or <lb/>
            pursuit. " The horse to the chariot, and the ox to the <lb/>
            plough, and swiftly alongside the ship scuds the dolphin, <lb/>
            while he that meditates destruction for the boar must find <lb/>
            a staunch hound." 3 But he that chafes and is grieved that <lb/>
            he is not at one and the same time " a lion reared on the <lb/>
            mountains, exulting in his strength,” 4and a little Maltese <note type="footnote"> <lb/>

            lap-dog 1 reared in the lap of a rich widow, is out of his <lb/>
            senses. And not a whit wiser is he who wishes to be an <lb/>
            Empedocles, or Plato, or Democritus, and write about the <lb/>
            world and the real nature of things, and at the same time <lb/>
            to be married like Euphorion to a rich wife, or to revel <lb/>
            and drink with Alexander like Medius ; and is grieved <lb/>
            and vexed if he is not also admired for his wealth like <lb/>
            Ismenias, and for his virtue like Epaminondas. But runners <lb/>
            are not discontented because they do not carry off the <lb/>
            crowns of wrestlers, but rejoice and delight in their own <lb/>
            crowns. “You are a citizen of Sparta : see you make the <lb/>
            most of her." So too said Solon : <lb/>
            " We will not change our virtue for their wealth, <lb/>
            For virtue never dies, but wealth has wings, <lb/>
            And flies about from one man to another." <lb/>
            And Strato the natural philosopher, when he heard that <lb/>
            Menedemus had many more pupils than he had, said, " Is <lb/>
            it wonderful at all that more wish to wash than to be <lb/>
            anointed ? " And Aristotle, writing to Antipater, said, <lb/>
            " Not only has Alexander a right to plume himself on his <lb/>
            rule over many subjects, but no less legitimate is satisfac­ <lb/>
            tion at. entertaining right opinions about the gods." For <lb/>
            those that think so highly of their own walk in life will <lb/>
            not be so envious about their neighbours'. We do not <lb/>
            expect a vine to bear figs, nor an olive grapes, yet now-a- <lb/>
            days, with regard to ourselves, if we have not at one and <lb/>
            the same time the privilege of being accounted rich and <lb/>
            learned, generals and philosophers, flatterers and outspoken, <lb/>
            stingy and extravagant, we slander ourselves and are dis­ <lb/>
            satisfied, and despise ourselves as living a maimed and <lb/>
            imperfect life. Furthermore, we see that nature teaches <lb/>
            us the same lesson. 2 For as she provides different kinds <lb/>
            of beasts with different kinds of food, and has not made all <lb/>
            carnivorous, or seed-pickers, or root-diggers, so she has <lb/>

            We ought each therefore to select the calling appropriate <lb/>
            for ourselves and labour energetically in it, and leave other <lb/>
            people to theirs, and not demonstrate Hesiod as coming <lb/>
            short of the real state of things when he said, <lb/>
            " Potter is wroth with potter, smith with smith.” 1 <lb/>
            For not only do people envy those of the same trade and <lb/>
            manner of life, but the rich envy the learned, and the <lb/>
            famous the rich, and advocates sophists, aye, and freemen <lb/>
            and patricians admire and think happy comedians starring <lb/>
            it at the theatres, and dancers, and the attendants at kings' <lb/>
            courts, and by all this envy give themselves no small <lb/>
            trouble and annoyance.</p>
          <p>§ xiv. But that every man has in himself the magazines <lb/>
            of content or discontent, and that the jars containing <lb/>
            blessings and evils are not on the threshold of Zeus,2 but <lb/>
            lie stored in the mind, is plain from the differences of <lb/>
            men's passions. For the foolish overlook and neglect <lb/>
            present blessings, through their thoughts being ever intent <lb/>
            on the future; but the wise make the past clearly present <lb/>
            to them through memory. For the present giving only a <lb/>
            moment of time to the touch, and then evading our grasp, <lb/>
            does not seem to the foolish to be ours or to belong to us <lb/>
            at all. And like that person3 painted as rope-making in <lb/>
            Hades and permitting an ass feeding by to eat up the rope <lb/>
            as fast as he makes it, so the stupid and thankless forget­ <lb/>
            fulness of most people comes upon them and takes posses­ <lb/>
            sion of them, and obliterates from their mind every past <lb/>
            action, whether success, or pleasant leisure, or society, or <lb/>
            enjoyment, and breaks the unity of life which arises from <lb/>
            the past being blended with the present; for detaching to- <lb/>
            day from both yesterday and to-morrow, it soon makes <lb/>
            every event as if it had never happened from lack of memory. <lb/>
            For as those in the schools, who deny the growth of our <lb/>
            bodies by reason of the continual flux of substance, make <lb/>
            each of us in theory different from himself and another <lb/>
            man, so those who do not keep or recall to their memory <lb/>
            former things, but let them drift, actually empty them- <note type="footnote"> 1 Hesiod, " Works and Days," 25.

            selves daily, and hang upon the morrow, as if what hap­ <lb/>
            pened a year ago, or even yesterday and the day before <lb/>
            yesterday, had nothing to do with them, and had hardly <lb/>
            occurred at all.</p>
          <p>§ xv. This is one great hindrance to contentedness of mind, <lb/>
            and another still greater is whenever, like flies that slide <lb/>
            down smooth places in mirrors, but stick fast in rough places <lb/>
            or where there are cracks, men let pleasant and agreeable <lb/>
            things glide from their memory, and pin themselves down <lb/>
            to the remembrance of unpleasant things; or rather, as at <lb/>
            Olynthus they say beetles, when they get into a certain <lb/>
            place called Destruction-to-beetles, cannot get out, but fly <lb/>
            round and round till they die, so men will glide into the <lb/>
            remembrance of their woes, and will not give themselves a <lb/>
            respite from sorrow. But, as we use our brightest colours <lb/>
            in a picture, so in the mind we ought to look at the cheerful <lb/>
            and bright side of things, and hide and keep down the <lb/>
            gloomy, for we cannot altogether obliterate or get rid of it. <lb/>
            For, as the strings of the bow and lyre are alternately <lb/>
            tightened and relaxed, so is it with the order of the world; <lb/>
            in human affairs there is nothing pure and without alloy. <lb/>
            But as in music there are high and low notes, and in gram­ <lb/>
            mar vowels and mutes, but neither the musician nor gram­ <lb/>
            marian decline to use either kinds, but know how to blend <lb/>
            and employ them both for their purpose, so in human <lb/>
            affairs which are balanced one against another,-for, as <lb/>
            Euripides says, <lb/>
            “There is no good without ill in the world, <lb/>
            But everything is mixed in due proportion,"­ <lb/>
            we ought not to be disheartened or despondent; but as <lb/>
            musicians drown their worst music with the best, so <lb/>
            should we take good and bad together, and make our <lb/>
            chequered life one of convenience and harmony. For it is <lb/>
            not, as Menander says, <lb/>
            “Directly any man is born, a genius <lb/>
            Befriends him, a good guide to him for life," <lb/>
            but it is rather, as Empedocles states, two fates or genii <lb/>
            take hold of each of us when we are born and govern us. <lb/>
            “There were Chthonia and far-seeing Heliope, and cruel <lb/>
            Deris, and grave Harmonia, and Callisto, and Æschra, and <note type="footnote"> X </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="306"/>
            Thoosa, and Densen, and charming Nemertes, and Asaphea <lb/>
            with the black fruit."</p>
          <p>§ XVI. And as1 at our birth we received the mingled <lb/>
            seeds of each of these passions, which is the cause of much <lb/>
            irregularity, the sensible person hopes for better things, <lb/>
            but expects worse, and makes the most of either, remem­ <lb/>
            bering that wise maxim, Not too much of anything. For not <lb/>
            only will he who is least solicitous about to-morrow best <lb/>
            enjoy it when it comes, as Epicures says, but also wealth, <lb/>
            and renown, and power and rule, gladden most of all the <lb/>
            hearts of those who are least afraid of the contrary. For <lb/>
            the immoderate desire for each, implanting a most im­ <lb/>
            moderate fear of losing them, makes the enjoyment of <lb/>
            them weak and wavering, like a flame under the influence <lb/>
            of a wind. But he whom reason enables to say to fortune <lb/>
            without fear or trembling, <lb/>
            " If you bring any good I gladly welcome it, <lb/>
            But if you fail me little does it trouble me," <lb/>
            he can enjoy the present with most zest through his confi­ <lb/>
            dence, and absence of fear of the loss of what he has, <lb/>
            which would be unbearable. For we may not only admire <lb/>
            but also imitate the behaviour of Anaxagoras, which made <lb/>
            him cry out at the death of his son, " I knew I had begot <lb/>
            a mortal," and apply it to every contingency. For example, <lb/>
            " I know that wealth is ephemeral and insecure; I know <lb/>
            that those who gave power can take it away again ; I know <lb/>
            that my wife is good, but still a woman; and that my <lb/>
            friend, since a human being, is by nature a changeable <lb/>
            animal, to use Plato's expression." For such a prepared <lb/>
            frame of mind, if anything happens unwished for but not <lb/>
            unexpected, not admitting of such phrases as " I shouldn't <lb/>
            have dreamed of it," or " I expected quite a different lot," <lb/>
            or " I didn't look for this," abates the violent8 beatings <lb/>
            and palpitations of the heart, and quickly causes wild un­ <lb/>
            rest to subside. Carneades indeed reminds us that in <lb/>
            great matters the unexpected makes the sum total of grief <lb/>
            and dejection. Certainly the kingdom of Macedonia was <lb/>
            many times smaller than the Roman- Empire, but when <note type="footnote"> 1 So Wyttenbacb, who reads <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ὡς δὲ τούτων</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Reading ola with Reiske. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="307"/>
            Perseus lost Macedonia, he not only himself bewailed his <lb/>
            wretched fate, but seemed to all men the most unfortunate <lb/>
            and unlucky of mankind ; yet .Emilius who conquered <lb/>
            him, though he had to give up to another the command <lb/>
            both by land and sea, yet was crowned, and offered sacri­ <lb/>
            fice, and was justly esteemed happy. For he knew that he <lb/>
            had taken a command which he would have to give up, <lb/>
            but Perseus lost his kingdom without expecting it. Well <lb/>
            also has the poet 1 shown the power of anything that hap­ <lb/>
            pens unexpectedly. For Odysseus wept bitterly at the death <lb/>
            of his dog, but was not so moved when he sat by his wife who <lb/>
            wept, for in the latter case he had come fully determined <lb/>
            to keep his emotion under the control of reason, whereas <lb/>
            in the former it was against his expectation, and therefore <lb/>
            fell upon him as a sudden blow.</p>
          <p>§ XVII. And since generally speaking some things which <lb/>
            happen against our will pain and trouble us by their very <lb/>
            nature, while in the case of most we accustom ourselves <lb/>
            and learn to be disgusted with them from fancy, it is not <lb/>
            unprofitable to counteract this to have ever ready that line <lb/>
            of Menander, <lb/>
            " You suffer no dread thing but in your fancy." <lb/>
            For what, if they touch you neither in soul nor body, are <lb/>
            such things to you as the low birth of your father, or the <lb/>
            adultery of your wife, or the loss of some prize or prece­ <lb/>
            dence, since even by their absence a man is not prevented <lb/>
            from being in excellent condition both of body and soul. <lb/>
            And with respect to the things that seem to pain us by <lb/>
            their very nature, as sickness, and anxieties, and the deaths <lb/>
            of friends and children, we should remember, that line of <lb/>
            Euripides, <lb/>
            " Alas! and why alas ? we only suffer <lb/>
            What mortals must expect." <lb/>
            For no argument has so much weight with emotion when <lb/>
            it is borne down with grief, as that which reminds it of the <lb/>
            common and natural necessity to which man is exposed <lb/>
            owing to the body, the only handle which he gives to for­ <lb/>
            tune, for in his most important and influential part he is <note type="footnote"> 1 Homer to wit.</note> <note type="footnote">2 The soul. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="308"/>
            secure against external things. When Demetrius captured <lb/>
            Megara, he asked Stilpo if any of his things had been <lb/>
            plundered, and Stilpo answered, " I saw nobody carrying <lb/>
            off anything of mine." 1 And so when fortune has plun­ <lb/>
            dered us and stripped us of everything else, we have that <lb/>
            within ourselves <lb/>
            “Which the Achæans ne'er could rob us of." 2 <lb/>
            So that we ought not altogether to abase and lower nature, <lb/>
            as if she had no strength or stability against fortune; but <lb/>
            on the contrary, knowing that the rotten and perishable <lb/>
            part of man, wherein alone he lies open to fortune, is small, <lb/>
            while we ourselves are masters of the better part, wherein <lb/>
            are situated our greatest blessings, as good opinions and <lb/>
            teaching and virtuous precepts, all which things cannot be <lb/>
            abstracted from us or perish, we ought to look on the <lb/>
            future with invincible courage, and say to fortune, as <lb/>
            Socrates is supposed to have said to his accusers Anytus <lb/>
            and Melitus before the jury, " Anytus and Melitus can kill <lb/>
            me, but they cannot hurt me." For fortune can afflict <lb/>
            us with disease, take away our money, calumniate us to <lb/>
            the people or king, but cannot make a good and brave and <lb/>
            high-souled man bad and cowardly and low and ignoble <lb/>
            and envious, nor take away that disposition of mind, whose <lb/>
            constant presence is of more use for the conduct of life <lb/>
            than the presence of a pilot at sea. For the pilot cannot <lb/>
            make calm the wild wave or wind, nor can he find a haven <lb/>
            at his need wherever he wishes, nor can he await his fate <lb/>
            with confidence and without trembling, but as long as he <lb/>
            has not despaired, but uses his skill, he scuds before the <lb/>
            gale, " lowering his big sail, till his lower mast is only just <lb/>
            above the sea dark as Erebus," and sits at the helm trem­ <lb/>
            bling and quaking. But the disposition of a wise man <lb/>
            gives calm even to the body, mostly cutting off the causes <lb/>
            of diseases by temperance and plain living and moderate <lb/>
            exercise ; but if some beginning of trouble arise from with­ <lb/>
            out, as we avoid a sunken rock, so he passes by it with <lb/>
            furled sail, as Asclepiades puts it; but if some unexpected <note type="footnote"> 1 The reading here is rather doubtful. That 1 have adopted is <lb/>
            Reiske's and Wyttenbach's. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 “Iliad,” v. 484 </note> <lb/>

            and tremendous gale come upon him and prove too much <lb/>
            for him, the harbour is at hand, and he can swim away <lb/>
            from the body, as from a leaky boat.</p>
          <p>§ XVIII. For it is the fear of death, and not the desire of <lb/>
            life, that makes the foolish person to hang to the body, <lb/>
            clinging to it, as Odysseus did to the fig-tree from fear of <lb/>
            Charybdis that lay below, <lb/>
            “Where the wind neither let him stay, or sail,” <lb/>
            so that he was displeased at this, and afraid of that. But <lb/>
            he who understands somehow or other the nature of the <lb/>
            soul, and reflects that the change it will undergo at death <lb/>
            will be either to something better or at least not worse, he <lb/>
            has in his fearlessness of death no small help to ease of <lb/>
            mind in life. For to one who can enjoy life when virtue <lb/>
            and what is congenial to him have the upper hand, and <lb/>
            that can fearlessly depart from life, when uncongenial and <lb/>
            unnatural things are in the ascendant, with the words on <lb/>
            his lips, <lb/>
            " The deity shall free me, when I will,” 1 <lb/>
            what can we imagine could befall such a man as this that <lb/>
            would vex him and wear him and harass him P For he <lb/>
            who said, " I have anticipated you, 0 fortune, and cut off <lb/>
            all your loopholes to get at me," did not trust to bolts <lb/>
            or keys or walls, but to determination and reason, which <lb/>
            are within the power of all persons that choose. And we <lb/>
            ought not to despair or disbelieve any of these sayings, but <lb/>
            admiring them and emulating them and being enthusi­ <lb/>
            astic about them, we ought to try and test ourselves in <lb/>
            smaller matters with a view to greater, not avoiding or <lb/>
            rejecting that self-examination, nor sheltering ourselves <lb/>
            under the remark, " Perhaps nothing will be more difficult." <lb/>
            For inertia2 and softness are generated by that self­ <lb/>
            indulgence which ever occupies itself only with the easiest <lb/>
            tasks, and flees from the disagreeable to what is most <lb/>
            pleasant. But the soul that accustoms itself to face <lb/>
            steadily sickness and grief and exile, and calls in reason to <lb/>
            its help in each case, will find in what appears so sore and <note type="footnote"> 1 Euripides, “Bacchæ,” 498. Compare Horace, “Epistles,” i. xvi. <lb/>

            dreadful much that is false, empty, and rotten, as reason <lb/>
            will show in each case.</p>
          <p>§ XIX. And yet many shudder at that line of Menander, <lb/>
            " No one can say, I shall not suffer this or that," <lb/>
            being ignorant how much it helps us to freedom from grief <lb/>
            to practise to be able to look fortune in the face with our <lb/>
            eyes open, and not to entertain fine and soft fancies, like <lb/>
            one reared in the shade on many hopes that always yield <lb/>
            and never resist. We can, however, answer Menander's line, <lb/>
            " No one can say, I shall not suffer this or that," <lb/>
            for a man can say, " I will not do this or that, I will not lie, <lb/>
            I will not play the rogue, I will not cheat, I will not <lb/>
            scheme." For this is in our power, and is no small but <lb/>
            great help to ease of mind. As on the contrary <lb/>
            “The consciousness of having done ill deeds,” 2 <lb/>
            like a sore in the flesh, leaves in the mind a regret which <lb/>
            ever wounds it and pricks it. For reason banishes all other <lb/>
            griefs, but itself creates regret when the soul is vexed with <lb/>
            shame and self-tormented. For as those who shudder in <lb/>
            ague-fits or burn in fevers feel more trouble and distress <lb/>
            than those who externally suffer the same from cold or heat, <lb/>
            so the grief is lighter which comes externally from chance, <lb/>
            but that lament, <lb/>
            " None is to blame for this but I myself," <lb/>
            coming from within on one's own misdeeds, intensifies one's <lb/>
            bitterness by the shame felt. And so neither costly house, <lb/>
            nor quantity of gold, nor pride of race, nor weighty office, <lb/>
            nor grace of language, nor eloquence, impart so much calm <lb/>
            and serenity to life, as a soul pure from evil acts and desires, <lb/>
            having an imperturbable and undefiled character as the <lb/>
            source of its life; whence good actions flow, producing <lb/>
            an enthusiastic and cheerful energy accompanied by lofti­ <lb/>
            ness of thought, and a memory sweeter and more lasting <lb/>
            than that hope which Pindar says is the support of old age. <lb/>
            Censers do not, as Carneades said, after they are emptied, <lb/>
            long retain their sweet smell; but in the mind of the wise <lb/>
            man good actions always leave a fresh and fragrant <lb/>

            despises those who wail over life and abuse it as a region <lb/>
            of ills, or as a place of exile for souls in this world.</p>
          <p>§ xx. I am very taken with Diogenes' remark to a <lb/>
            stranger at Lacedæmon, who was dressing with much dis­ <lb/>
            play for a feast, " Does not a good man consider every day <lb/>
            a feast ? " And a very great feast too, if we live soberly. <lb/>
            For the world is a most holy and divine temple, into which <lb/>
            man is introduced at his birth, not to behold motionless <lb/>
            images made by hands, but those things (to use the lan­ <lb/>
            guage of Plato) which the divine mind has exhibited <lb/>
            as the visible representations of invisible things, having <lb/>
            innate in them the principle of life and motion, as the sun <lb/>
            moon and stars, and rivers ever flowing with fresh water, <lb/>
            and the earth affording maintenance to plants and animals. <lb/>
            Seeing then that life is the most complete initiation into <lb/>
            all these things, it ought to be full of ease of mind and <lb/>
            joy; not as most people wait for the festivals of Cronos 1 <lb/>
            and Dionysus and the Panathenæa and other similar days, <lb/>
            that they may joy and refresh themselves with bought <lb/>
            laughter, paying actors and dancers for the same. On <lb/>
            such occasions indeed we sit silently and decorously, <lb/>
            for no one wails when he is initiated, or groans when he <lb/>
            beholds the Pythian games, or when he is drinking at the <lb/>
            festival of Cronos: :1 but men shame the festivals which <lb/>
            the deity supplies us with and initiates as in, passing most <lb/>
            of their time in lamentation and heaviness of heart and dis­ <lb/>
            tressing anxiety. And though men delight in the pleasing <lb/>
            notes of musical instruments, and in the songs of birds, <lb/>
            and behold with joy the animals playing and frisking, and <lb/>
            on the contrary are distressed when they roar and howl <lb/>
            and look savage; yet in regard to their own life, when they <lb/>
            see it without smiles and dejected, and ever oppressed and <lb/>
            afflicted by the most wretched sorrows and toils and un­ <lb/>
            ending cares, they do not think of trying to procure allevia­ <lb/>
            tion and ease. How is this ? Nay, they will not even <lb/>
            listen to others' exhortation, which would enable them to <lb/>
            acquiesce in the present without repining, and to remember <lb/>
            the past with thankfulness, and to meet the future hope­ <lb/>
            fully and cheerfully without fear or suspicion. <note type="footnote"> 1 The Saturnalia (as the Romans called this feast) was well known as <lb/>

            <title type="sub">ON ENVY AND HATRED.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>§ I. Outwardly there seems no difference between hatred <lb/>
            and envy, but they seem identical. For generally speaking, <lb/>
            as vice has many hooks, and is swayed hither and thither by <lb/>
            the passions that hang on it, there are many points of con­ <lb/>
            tact and entanglement between them, for as in the case of <lb/>
            illnesses there is a sympathy between the various passions. <lb/>
            Thus the prosperous man is equally a source of pain to hate <lb/>
            and envy. And so we think benevolence the opposite of <lb/>
            both these passions, being as it is a wish for our neigh­ <lb/>
            bour's good, and we think hate and envy identical, for the <lb/>
            desire of both is the very opposite of benevolence. But <lb/>
            since their similarities are not so great as their dissimilari­ <lb/>
            ties, let us investigate and trace out these two passions <lb/>
            from their origin.</p>
          <p>§ II. Hatred then is generated by the fancy that the per­ <lb/>
            son hated is either bad generally or bad to oneself. For <lb/>
            those who think they are wronged naturally hate those who <lb/>
            they think wrong them, and dislike and are on their <lb/>
            guard against those who are injurious or bad to others ;1 but <lb/>
            people envy merely those they think prosperous. So envy <lb/>
            seems illimitable, being, like ophthalmia, troubled at every­ <lb/>
            thing bright, whereas hatred is limited, since it settles only <lb/>
            on what seems hostile.</p>
          <p>§ III. In the second place people feel hatred even against <lb/>
            the brutes; for some hate cats and beetles and toads and <lb/>
            serpents. Thus Germanicus could not bear the crowing or <lb/>
            sight of a cock, and the Persian magicians kill their mice, <lb/>
            not only hating them themselves but thinking them hateful <lb/>
            to their god, and the Arabians and Ethiopians abominate <lb/>
            them as much. Whereas we envy only human beings.</p>
          <p>§ iv. Indeed among the brutes it is not likely that there <lb/>
            should be any envy, for they have no conception of pros­ <lb/>
            perity or adversity, nor have they any idea of reputation or <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄλλως</foreign> MSS. Wythenbach <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄλλων</foreign>. Malo <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄλλοις</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="313"/>
            want of reputation, which are the things that mainly <lb/>
            excite envy; but they hate one another, and are hostile to <lb/>
            one another, and fight with one another to the death, as <lb/>
            eagles and dragons, crows and owls, titmice and finches, <lb/>
            insomuch that they say that even the blood of these crea­ <lb/>
            tures will not mix, and if you try to mix it it will imme­ <lb/>
            diately separate again. It is likely also that there is strong <lb/>
            hatred between the cock and the lion, and the pig and <lb/>
            the elephant, owing to fear. For what people fear they <lb/>
            naturally hate. We see also from this that envy differs <lb/>
            from hatred, for the animals are capable of the one, but <lb/>
            not of the other.</p>
          <p>§ v. Moreover envy against anyone is never just, for no <lb/>
            one wrongs another by his prosperity, though that is what <lb/>
            he is envied for; but many are hated with justice, for we <lb/>
            even think others1 worthy of hatred, if they do not flee <lb/>
            from such, and are not disgusted and vexed at them. A <lb/>
            great indication of this is that some people admit they hate <lb/>
            many, but declare they envy nobody. Indeed hatred of <lb/>
            evil is reckoned among praiseworthy things ; and when <lb/>
            some were praising Charillus, the nephew of Lycurgus and <lb/>
            king of Sparta, for his mildness and gentleness, his col­ <lb/>
            league said, " How can Charillus be good, who is not even <lb/>
            harsh to the bad ? " And so the poet described the bodily <lb/>
            defects of Thersites at much length, whereas he expressed <lb/>
            his vile moral character most shortly and by one remark, <lb/>
            " He was most hateful both to Achilles and Odysseus." 2 <lb/>
            For to be hated by the most excellent is the height of <lb/>
            worthlessness. But people deny that they are envious, and, <lb/>
            if they are charged with being so, they put forward ten <lb/>
            thousand pleas, saying they are angry with the man or <lb/>
            fear him or hate him, suggesting any other passion than <lb/>
            envy, and concealing it as the only disorder of the soul <lb/>
            which is abominable.</p>
          <p>§ vi. Of necessity then these two passions cannot, like <lb/>
            plants, be fed and nourished and grow on the same roots; <lb/>
            for they are by nature different.3 For we hate people <lb/>
            more as they grow worse, but they are envied only t ie <note type="footnote"> 1 So Wyttenbach. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Homer, "Iliad," ii. 220 </note><note type="footnote"> 3 So Wyttenbach. The reading in this pas age is very doubtful. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="314"/>
            more the more they advance in virtue. And so Themistocles, <lb/>
            when quite a lad, said he had done nothing remarkable, for <lb/>
            he was not yet envied. For as insects attack most ripe corn <lb/>
            and roses in their bloom, so envy fastens most on the good <lb/>
            and on those who are growing in virtue and good repute <lb/>
            for moral character. Again extreme badness intensifies <lb/>
            hatred. So hated indeed and loathed were the accusers of <lb/>
            Socrates, as guilty of extreme vileness, by their fellow- <lb/>
            citizens, that they would neither supply them with fire, nor <lb/>
            answer their questions, nor touch the water they had <lb/>
            bathed in, but ordered the servants to pour it away as <lb/>
            polluted, till they could bear this hatred no longer and <lb/>
            hung themselves. But splendid and exceptional success <lb/>
            often extinguishes envy. For it is not likely that anyone <lb/>
            envied Alexander or Cyrus, after their conquests made <lb/>
            them lords of the world. But as the sun, when it is <lb/>
            high over our heads and sends down its rays, makes next <lb/>
            to no shadow, so at those successes that attain such a height <lb/>
            as to be over its head envy is humbled, and retires com­ <lb/>
            pletely dazzled. So Alexander had none to envy him, <lb/>
            but many to hate him, by whom he was plotted against <lb/>
            till he died. So too misfortunes stop envy, but they do not <lb/>
            remove hatred. For people hate their enemies even when <lb/>
            they lie prostrate at their feet, but no one envies the un­ <lb/>
            fortunate. But the remark of one of the sophists of our day <lb/>
            is true, that the envious are very prone to pity; so here too <lb/>
            there is a great difference between these two passions, for <lb/>
            hatred abandons neither the fortunate nor unfortunate, <lb/>
            whereas envy is mitigated in the extreme of either fortune.</p>
          <p>§ VII. Let us look at the same again from opposite points <lb/>
            of view. Men put an end to their enmity and hatred, <lb/>
            either if persuaded they have not been wronged, or if they <lb/>
            come round to the view that those they hated are good men <lb/>
            and not bad, or thirdly if they receive a kindness. For, as <lb/>
            Thucydides says, the last favour conferred, even though a <lb/>
            smaller one, if it be seasonable, outweighs a greater offence.' <lb/>
            Yet the persuasion that they have not been wronged does <lb/>
            not put an end to envy, for people envy although absolutely <lb/>
            persuaded that they have not been wronged; and the two <note type="footnote"> 1 Thuc. di les, 1. 42. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="315"/>
            other cases actually increase envy; for people look with an <lb/>
            evil eye even more on those they think good, as having vir­ <lb/>
            tue, which is the greatest blessing ; and if they are treated <lb/>
            kindly by the prosperous it grieves them, for they envy both <lb/>
            their will and power to do kindnesses, the former proceeding <lb/>
            from their goodness, the latter from their prosperity, but <lb/>
            both being blessings. Thus envy is a passion altogether <lb/>
            different from hatred, seeing that what abates the one pains <lb/>
            and exasperates the other.</p>
          <p>§ VIII. Let us now look at the intent of each of these <lb/>
            passions. The intent of the person who hates is to do <lb/>
            as much harm as he can, so they define hatred to be a dispo­ <lb/>
            sition and intent on the watch for an opportunity to do <lb/>
            harm. But this is altogether foreign to envy.1 For those <lb/>
            who envy their relations and friends would not wish them <lb/>
            to come to ruin, or fall into calamity, but are only annoyed <lb/>
            at their prosperity ; and would hinder, if they could, their <lb/>
            glory and renown, but they would not bring upon them <lb/>
            irremediable misfortunes: they are content to remove, as <lb/>
            in the case of a lofty house, what stands in their light.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">HOW ONE CAN PRAISE ONESELF WITHOUT EXCITING ENVY.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>§ I. To speak to other people about one's own impor­ <lb/>
            tance or ability, Herculanus, is universally declared to be <lb/>
            tiresome and illiberal, but in fact not many even of those <lb/>
            who censure it avoid its unpleasantness. Thus Euripides, <lb/>
            though he says, <lb/>
            " If words had to be bought by human beings, <lb/>
            No one would wish to trumpet his own praises. <lb/>
            But since one can get words sans any payment <lb/>
            From lofty ether, everyone delights <lb/>
            In speaking truth or falsehood of himself, <lb/>
            For he can do it with impunity; " <lb/>
            yet uses much tiresome boasting, intermixing with the <lb/>
            passion and action of his plays irrelevant matter about <lb/>
            himself. Similarly Pindar says, that " to boast unseason- <note type="footnote"> 1 Reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄπεστιν ὄλως</foreign>. Oi <foreign xml:lang="grc">γὰρ φθονου̃ντες</foreign>. What can be made of <lb/>

             <pb n="316"/>
            ably is to play an accompaniment to madness," 1 yet he <lb/>
            does not cease to talk big about his own merit, which <lb/>
            indeed is well worthy of encomium, who would deny it ? <lb/>
            But those who are crowned in the games leave it to others <lb/>
            to celebrate their victories, to avoid the unpleasantness of <lb/>
            singing their own praises. So we are with justice dis­ <lb/>
            gusted at Timotheus' for trumpeting his own glory inele­ <lb/>
            gantly and contrary to custom in the inscription for his <lb/>
            victory over Phrynis, " A proud day for you, Timotheus, <lb/>
            was it when the herald cried out, ' The Milesian Timotheus <lb/>
            is victorious over the son of Carbo and his Ionic notes.' " <lb/>
            As Xenophon says, " Praise from others is the pleasantest <lb/>
            thing a man can hear," 3 but to others a man's self-praise is <lb/>
            most nauseous. For first we think those impudent who <lb/>
            praise themselves, since modesty would be becoming even <lb/>
            if they were praised by others; secondly, we think them <lb/>
            unjust in giving themselves what they ought to receive <lb/>
            from others; thirdly, if we are silent we seem to be vexed <lb/>
            and to envy them, and if we are afraid of this imputation, <lb/>
            we are obliged to heap praise upon them contrary to our <lb/>
            real opinion, and to bear them out, undertaking a task <lb/>
            more befitting gross flattery than honour.</p>
          <p>§ II. And yet, in spite of all this, there are occasions <lb/>
            when a statesman may venture to speak in his own praise, <lb/>
            not to cry up his own glory and merit, but when the time <lb/>
            and matter demand that he should speak the truth about <lb/>
            himself, as he would about another; especially when it is <lb/>
            mentioned that another has done good and excellent <lb/>
            things," there is no need for him to suppress the fact that <lb/>
            he has done as well. For such self-praise bears excellent <lb/>
            fruit, since much more and better praise springs from it as <lb/>
            from seed. For the statesman does not ask for reputation <lb/>
            as a reward or consolation, nor is he merely pleased at its <lb/>
            attending upon his actions, but he values it because credit <lb/>
            and character give him opportunities to do good on a larger <lb/>
            scale. For it is both easy and pleasant to benefit those who <note type="footnote"> 1 Pindar, " Olymp." ix. 57, 58. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Mentioned by Pausanias, iii. 12; viii. 50. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 it Memorabilia," ii. 1. 31. </note><note type="footnote">4 Reading as Wyttenbach suggests, <foreign xml:lang="grc">μάλιστα δὲ ὅταν λέγηται</foreign> ra <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄλλψ <lb/>

            believe in us and are friendly to us, but it is not easy to <lb/>
            act virtuously against suspicion and calumny, and to force <lb/>
            one's benefits on those that reject them. Let us now con­ <lb/>
            sider, if there are any other reasons warranting self-praise <lb/>
            in a statesman, what they are, that, while we avoid vain <lb/>
            glory and disgusting other people, we may not omit any <lb/>
            useful kind of self-praise.</p>
          <p>§ III. That is vain glory then when men seem to praise <lb/>
            themselves that they may call forth the laudation of <lb/>
            others; and it is especially despised because it seems to <lb/>
            proceed from ambition and an unseasonable opinion of <lb/>
            oneself. For as those who cannot obtain food are forced <lb/>
            to feed on their own flesh against nature, and that is the <lb/>
            end of famine, so those that hunger after praise, if they get <lb/>
            no one else to praise them, disgrace themselves by their <lb/>
            anxiety to feed their own vanity. But when, not merely <lb/>
            content with praising themselves, they vie with the praise <lb/>
            of others, and pit their own deeds and actions against <lb/>
            theirs, with the intent of outshining them, they add <lb/>
            envy and malignity to their vanity. The proverb teaches <lb/>
            us that to put our foot into another's dance is meddlesome <lb/>
            and ridiculous; we ought equally to be on our guard <lb/>
            against intruding our own panegyric into others' praises <lb/>
            out of envy and spite, nor should we allow others either to <lb/>
            praise us then, but we should make way for those that are <lb/>
            being honoured, if they are worthy of honour, and even if <lb/>
            they seem to us undeserving of honour and worthless, we <lb/>
            ought not to strip them of their praise by self-laudation, <lb/>
            but by direct argument and proof that they are not worthy <lb/>
            of all these encomiums. It is plain then that we ought to <lb/>
            avoid all such conduct as this.</p>
          <p>§ IV. But self-praise cannot be blamed, if it is an answer <lb/>
            to some charge or calumny, as those words of Pericles, <lb/>
            " And yet you are angry with such a man as me, a man I <lb/>
            take it inferior to no one either in knowledge of what <lb/>
            should be done, or in ability to point out the same, and a <lb/>
            lover of my country to boot, and superior to bribes." 1 For <lb/>
            not only did he avoid all swagger and vainglory and ambi­ <lb/>
            tion in talking thus loftily about himself, but he also exhi- <note type="footnote"> 1 Thucydides, ii. 60. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="318"/>
            bited the spirit and greatness of his virtue, which could <lb/>
            abase and crush envy because it could not be abased itself. <lb/>
            For people will hardly condemn such men, for they are <lb/>
            elevated and cheered and inspired by noble self-laudation <lb/>
            such as this, if it have a true basis, as all history testifies. <lb/>
            Thus the Thebans, when their generals were charged with <lb/>
            not returning home, and laying down their office of <lb/>
            Bœotarchs when their time had expired, but instead of <lb/>
            that making inroads into Laconia, and helping Messene, <lb/>
            hardly acquitted Pelopidas, who was submissive and sup­ <lb/>
            pliant, but for Epaminondas,1 who gloried in what he had <lb/>
            done, and at last said that he was ready to die, if they <lb/>
            would confess that he had ravaged Laconia, and restored <lb/>
            Messene, and made Arcadia one state, against the will of <lb/>
            the Thebans, they would not pass sentence upon him, but <lb/>
            admired his heroism, and with rejoicing and smiles set him <lb/>
            free. So too we must not altogether find fault with <lb/>
            Sthenelus in Homer saying, <lb/>
            " We boast ourselves far better than our fathers,"3 <lb/>
            when we remember the words of Agamemnon, <lb/>
            " How now ? thou son of brave horse-taming Tydeus, <lb/>
            Why dust thou crouch for fear, and watch far off <lb/>
            The lines of battle ? How unlike thy father! " 3 <lb/>
            For it was not because he was defamed himself, but he <lb/>
            stood up for his friend' that was abused, the occasion <lb/>
            giving him a reasonable excuse for self-commendation. <lb/>
            So too the Romans were far from pleased at Cicero's <lb/>
            frequently passing encomiums upon himself in the affair <lb/>
            of Catiline, yet when Scipio said they ought not to try him <lb/>
            (Scipio), since he had given them the power to try anybody, <lb/>
            they put on garlands, and accompanied him to the Capitol, <lb/>
            and sacrificed with him. For Cicero was not compelled to <lb/>
            praise himself, but only did so for glory, whereas the <lb/>
            danger in which Scipio stood removed envy from him.</p>
          <p>§ v. And not only on one's trial and in danger, but also <lb/>
            in misfortune, is tall talk and boasting more suitable than <lb/>
            in prosperity. For in prosperity people seem to clutch as <lb/>
            it were at glory and enjoy it, and so gratify their ambition ; <note type="footnote"> 1 See Pausanias, ix. 14, 15.</note> <note type="footnote">2 Homer, Iliad," iv. 405. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Homer, " Iliad," iv. 370, 371.</note> <note type="footnote">4 Diomede. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="319"/>
            but in adversity, being far from ambition owing to circum­ <lb/>
            stances, such self-commendation seems to be a bearing up <lb/>
            and fortifying the spirit against fortune, and an avoidance <lb/>
            altogether of that desire for pity and condolence, and that <lb/>
            humility, which we often find in adversity. As then we <lb/>
            esteem those persons vain and without sense who in walking <lb/>
            hold themselves very erect and with a stiff neck, yet in <lb/>
            boxing or fighting we commend such as bold themselves up <lb/>
            and alert, so the man struggling with adversity, who <lb/>
            stands up straight against his fate, " in fighting posture <lb/>
            like some boxer,"1 and instead of being humble and abject <lb/>
            becomes through his boasting lofty and dignified, seems to <lb/>
            be not offensive and impudent, but great and invincible. <lb/>
            This is why, I suppose, Homer has represented Patroclus <lb/>
            modest and without reproach in prosperity, yet at the <lb/>
            moment of death saying grandiloquently, <lb/>
            " Had twenty warriors fought me such as thou, <lb/>
            All had succumbed to my victorious spear." 2 <lb/>
            And Phocion, though in other respects he was gentle, yet <lb/>
            after his sentence exhibited his greatness of soul to many <lb/>
            others, and notably to one of those that were to die with <lb/>
            him, who was weeping and wailing, to whom he said, <lb/>
            " What! are you not content to die with Phocion ? "</p>
          <p>§ vi. Not less, but still more, lawful is it for a public <lb/>
            man who is wronged to speak on his own behalf to those <lb/>
            who treat him with ingratitude. Thus Achilles generally <lb/>
            conceded glory to the gods, and modestly used such lan­ <lb/>
            guage as, <lb/>
            " If ever Zeus <lb/>
            Shall grant to me to sack Troy's well-built town ;" 3 <lb/>
            but when insulted and outraged contrary to his deserts, he <lb/>
            utters in his rage boastful words, <lb/>
            " Alighting from my ships twelve towns I sacked,"4 <lb/>
            and, <lb/>
            "For they will never dare to face my helmet <lb/>
            When it gleams near," 5 <note type="footnote"> 1 Sophocles, " Trachiniæ," 442. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Homer, " Iliad," xvi. 847, 848. Plutarch only quotes the first line. <lb/>
            I have added the second for the English reader, as necessary for tile <lb/>

             <pb n="320"/>
            For frank outspokenness, when it is part of one's defence, <lb/>
            admits of boasting. It was in this spirit no doubt that <lb/>
            Themistocles, who neither in word nor deed had given any <lb/>
            offence, when he saw the Athenians were tired of him and <lb/>
            treating him with neglect, did not abstain from saying, <lb/>
            " My good sirs, why do you tire of receiving benefits so <lb/>
            frequently at the same hands ? " and " When the storm is <lb/>
            on you fly to me for shelter as to a tree, but when fine <lb/>
            weather comes again, then you pass by and strip me of my <lb/>
            leaves."</p>
          <p>§ VII. They then that are wronged generally mention <lb/>
            what they have done well to those who are ungrateful. <lb/>
            And the person who is blamed for what he has done well is <lb/>
            altogether to be pardoned, and not censured, if he passes <lb/>
            encomiums on his own actions : for he is in the position of <lb/>
            one not scolding but making his defence. This it was <lb/>
            that made Demosthenes' freedom of speech splendid, and <lb/>
            prevented people being wearied out by the praise which in <lb/>
            all his speech On the Crown he lavished on himself, pluming <lb/>
            himself on those embassies and decrees in connection with <lb/>
            the war with which fault had been found.</p>
          <p>§ VIII. Not very unlike this is the grace of antithesis, <lb/>
            when a person shows that the opposite of what he is <lb/>
            charged with is base and low. Thus Lycurgus when he was <lb/>
            charged at Athens with having bribed an informer to <lb/>
            silence, replied, " What kind of a citizen do you think me, <lb/>
            who, having had so long time the fingering of your public <lb/>
            money, am detected in giving rather than taking unjustly ?" <lb/>
            And Cicero, when Metellus told him that he had destroyed <lb/>
            more as a witness than he had got acquitted as an advo­ <lb/>
            cate, answered, " Who denies that my honesty is greater <lb/>
            than my eloquence?" Compare such sayings of Demos­ <lb/>
            thenes as, " Who would not have been justified in killing <lb/>
            me, had I tried in word only to impair the ancient glory of <lb/>
            our city ? " 2 And, " What think you these wretches would <lb/>
            have said, if the states had departed, when I was curiously <lb/>
            discussing these points? " 3 And indeed the whole of that <lb/>
            speech On the Grown most ingeniously introduces his own <note type="footnote"> 1 So Wyttenbach.</note> <note type="footnote">2 Demosthenes, " De Corona," p. 260. </note> <note type="footnote"> a " De Corona," p. 307. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="321"/>
            praises in his antitheses, and answers to the charges brought <lb/>
            against him.</p>
          <p>§ ix. However it is worth while to notice in his speech <lb/>
            that he most artistically inserts praise of his audience in <lb/>
            the remarks about himself, and so makes his speech less <lb/>
            egotistical and less likely to raise envy. Thus he shows <lb/>
            how the Athenians behaved to the Euboeans and to the <lb/>
            Thebans, and what benefits they conferred on the people of <lb/>
            Byzantium and on the Chersonese, claiming for himself <lb/>
            only a subordinate part in the matter. Thus he cunningly <lb/>
            insinuates into the audience with his own praises what they <lb/>
            will gladly hear, for they rejoice at the enumeration of <lb/>
            their successes,1 and their joy is succeeded by admiration <lb/>
            and esteem for the person to whom the success was due. <lb/>
            So also Epaminondas, when Meneclidas once jeered at him <lb/>
            as thinking more of himself than Agamemnon ever did, <lb/>
            replied, " It is your fault then, men of Thebes, by whose <lb/>
            help alone I put down the power of the Lacedæmonians in <lb/>
            one day."</p>
          <p>§ x. But since most people very much dislike and object to <lb/>
            a man's praising himself, but if he praises some one else are <lb/>
            on the contrary often glad and readily bear him out, some are <lb/>
            in, the habit of praising in season those that have the same <lb/>
            pursuits business and characters as themselves, and so con­ <lb/>
            ciliate and move the audience in their own favour; for the <lb/>
            audience know at the moment such a one is speaking <lb/>
            that, though he is speaking about another, yet his own <lb/>
            similar virtue is worthy of their praise.2 For as one who <lb/>
            throws in another's teeth things of which he is guilty him­ <lb/>
            self must know that he upbraids himself most, so the good <lb/>
            in paying honour to the good remind those who know their <lb/>
            character of themselves, so that their hearers cry out at <lb/>
            once, " Are not you such a one yourself?" Thus Alex­ <lb/>
            ander honouring Hercules, and Androcottus again honour­ <lb/>
            ing Alexander, got themselves honoured on the same <lb/>
            grounds. Dionysius on the contrary pulling Gelon to <lb/>
            pieces, and calling him the Gelos3 of Sicily, was not aware <lb/>
            that through his envy he was weakening the importance <lb/>
            and dignity of his own authority. <note type="footnote"> I After Wyttenbach.</note> <note type="footnote">2 After Wyttenbach. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 That is, laughing-stock. A play on the word Gelon. </note> <note type="footnote"> Y </note> <pb n="322"/>
            </p>
          <p>§ xi. These things then a public man must generally <lb/>
            know and observe. But those that are compelled to praise <lb/>
            themselves do so less offensively if they do not ascribe all <lb/>
            the honour to themselves, but, being aware that their glory <lb/>
            will be tiresome to others, set it down partly to fortune, <lb/>
            partly to the deity. So Achilles said well, <lb/>
            " Since the gods granted us to kill this hero."1 <lb/>
            Well also did Timoleon, who erected a temple at Syracuse <lb/>
            to the goddess of Fortune after his success, and dedicated <lb/>
            his house to the Good Genius. Excellently again did <lb/>
            Pytho of Ænos, (when he came to Athens after killing <lb/>
            Cotys, and when the demagogues vied with one another in <lb/>
            praising him to the people, and he observed that some were <lb/>
            jealous and displeased,) in coming forward and saying, <lb/>
            " Men of Athens, this is the doing of one of the gods, I <lb/>
            only put my hands to the work." Bulla also forestalled <lb/>
            envy by ever praising fortune, and eventually he pro­ <lb/>
            claimed himself as under the protection of Aphrodite.2 For <lb/>
            men would rather ascribe their defeat to fortune than the <lb/>
            enemy's valour, for in the former case they consider it an ac­ <lb/>
            cident, whereas in the latter case they would have to blame <lb/>
            themselves and set it down to their own shortcomings. So <lb/>
            they say the legislation of Zaleucus pleased the Locrians not <lb/>
            least, because he said that Athene visited him from time to <lb/>
            time, and suggested to him and taught him his laws, and <lb/>
            that none of those he promulgated were his own idea and <lb/>
            plan.</p>
          <p>§ XII. Perhaps this kind of remedy by talking people <lb/>
            over must be contrived for those who are altogether <lb/>
            crabbed or envious; but for people of moderation it is not <lb/>
            amiss to qualify excessive praise. Thus if anyone should <lb/>
            praise you as learned, or rich, or influential, it would be <lb/>
            well to bid him not talk about you in that strain, but say <lb/>
            that yo.u were good and harmless and useful. For the person <lb/>
            that acts so does not introduce his own praise but transfers <lb/>
            it, nor does he seem to rejoice in people passing encomiums <lb/>
            upon him, but rather to be vexed at their praising him <lb/>
            inappropriately and on wrong grounds, and he seems to <note type="footnote"> 1 Homer, " Iliad," xxii. 379. He speaks of Hector. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Others take it Ias fortune's favourite." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="323"/>
            hïde bad traits by better ones, not wishing to be praised, <lb/>
            but showing how he ought to be praised. Such seems <lb/>
            the intent of such words as the following, " I have not <lb/>
            fortified the city with stones or bricks, but if you wish to <lb/>
            see how I have fortified it, you will find arms and horses <lb/>
            and allies.,, 1 Still more in point are the last words of <lb/>
            Pericles. For as he was dying, and his friends very natu­ <lb/>
            rally were weeping and wailing, and reminded him of his <lb/>
            military services and his power, and the trophies and vic­ <lb/>
            tories and towns he had won for Athens, and was leaving <lb/>
            as a legacy, he raised himself up a little and blamed them <lb/>
            as praising him for things common to many, and some of <lb/>
            them the results of fortune rather than merit, while they <lb/>
            had passed over the best and greatest of his deeds and one <lb/>
            peculiarly his own, that he had never been the cause of <lb/>
            any Athenian's wearing mourning. This gives the orator <lb/>
            an example, if he be a good man, when praised for his <lb/>
            eloquence, to transfer the praise to his life and character, <lb/>
            and the general who is admired for his skill and good <lb/>
            fortune in war to speak with confidence about his gentle­ <lb/>
            ness and uprightness. And again, if any very extravagant <lb/>
            praise is uttered, such as many people use in flattery which <lb/>
            provokes envy, one can reply, <lb/>
            "I am no god; why do you liken me <lb/>
            To the immortals ? "2 <lb/>
            If you really know me, praise my integrity, or my sobriety, <lb/>
            or my kindheartedness, or my philanthropy. For even envy <lb/>
            is not reluctant to give moderate praise to one that depre­ <lb/>
            cates excessive praise, and true panegyric is not lost by <lb/>
            people refusing to accept idle and false praise. So those <lb/>
            kings who would not be called gods or the sons of gods, <lb/>
            but only fond of their brothers or mother, or benefactors,3 <lb/>
            or dear to the gods, did not excite the envy of those that <lb/>
            honoured them by those titles, that were noble but still <lb/>
            such as men might claim. Again, people dislike those writers <lb/>
            or speakers who entitle themselves wise, but they wel- <note type="footnote"> 1 Words of Demosthenes, " De Corona," p. 325. Plutarch condenses <lb/>
            them. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Homer, "Odyssey," xvi. 187. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Titles of the Ptolemies, Philadelphus Philometor, Euergetes. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="324"/>
            come those who content themselves with saying that they <lb/>
            are lovers of philosophy, and have made some progress, or <lb/>
            use some such moderate language about themselves as that, <lb/>
            which does not excite envy. But rhetorical sophists, who <lb/>
            expect to hear " Divine, wonderful, grand," at their decla­ <lb/>
            mations, are not even welcomed with " Pretty fair, so so."</p>
          <p>§ XIII. Moreover, as people anxious not to injure those <lb/>
            who have weak eyes, draw a shade over too much light, <lb/>
            so some people make their praise of themselves less glaring <lb/>
            and absolute, by pointing out some of their small defects, <lb/>
            or miscarriages, or errors, and so remove all risk of making <lb/>
            people offended or envious. Thus Epeus, who boasts very <lb/>
            much of his skill in boxing, and says very confidently, <lb/>
            " I can your body crush, and break your bones,"1 <lb/>
            yet says, <lb/>
            " Is't not enough that I'm in fight deficient ? " a <lb/>
            But Epeus is perhaps a ridiculous instance, excusing his <lb/>
            bragging as an athlete by his confession of timidity and <lb/>
            want of manliness. But agreeable and graceful is that <lb/>
            man who mentions his own forgetfulness, or ignorance, or <lb/>
            ambition, or eager desire for knowledge and conversation. <lb/>
            Thus Odysseus of the Sirens, <lb/>
            " My heart to listen to them did incline, <lb/>
            I bade my comrades by a nod to unloose me." 3 <lb/>
            And again of the Cyclops, <lb/>
            " I did not hearken (it had been far better), <lb/>
            I wished to see the Cyclops, and to taste <lb/>
            His hospitality."4 <lb/>
            And generally speaking the admixture with praise of such <lb/>
            faults as are not altogether base and ignoble stops envy. <lb/>
            Thus many have blunted the point of envy by admitting <lb/>
            and introducing, when they have been praised, their past <lb/>
            poverty and straits, aye, and their low origin. So Aga­ <lb/>
            thocles pledging his young men in golden cups beautifully <lb/>
            chased, ordered some earthenware pots to be brought in, and <lb/>
            said, " See the fruits of perseverance, labour, and bravery ! <lb/>
            Once I produced pots like these, but now golden cups." <note type="footnote"> 1 Homer, " Iliad," xxiii. 673.</note> <note type="footnote">2 Ibid. 670. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Homer, " Odyssey," xii. 192-194.</note> <note type="footnote">4 Ibid. ix. 228, 229. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="325"/>
            For Agathocles it seems was so low-born and poor that he <lb/>
            was brought up in a potter's shop, though afterwards he <lb/>
            was king of almost all Sicily.</p>
          <p>§ xiv. These are external remedies against self-praise. <lb/>
            There are other internal ones as it were, such as Cato <lb/>
            applied, when he said " he was envied, because he had <lb/>
            to neglect his own affairs, and lie awake every night for <lb/>
            the interests of his country." Compare also the following <lb/>
            lines, <lb/>
            " How should I boast ? who could with ease have been <lb/>
            Enrolled among the many in the army, <lb/>
            And had a fortune equal to the wisest;"1 <lb/>
            and, <lb/>
            " I shrink from squandering past labours! grace, <lb/>
            Nor do I now reject all present toil." 1 <lb/>
            For as it is with house and farm, so also is it with glory <lb/>
            and reputation, people for the most part envy those who <lb/>
            have got them easily or for nothing, not those who have <lb/>
            bought them at the cost of much toil and danger.</p>
          <p>§ XV. Since then we can praise ourselves not only with­ <lb/>
            out causing pain or envy but even usefully and advan­ <lb/>
            tageously, let us consider, that we may not seem to have <lb/>
            only that end in view but some other also, if we might <lb/>
            praise ourselves to excite in our hearers emulation and <lb/>
            ambition. For Nestor, by reciting his battles and acts of <lb/>
            prowess, stirred up Patroclus and nine others to single <lb/>
            combat with Hector. For the exhortation that adds deed <lb/>
            to word and example and proper emulation is animating <lb/>
            and moving and stimulating, and with its impulse and <lb/>
            resolution inspires hope that the things we aim at are <lb/>
            attainable and not impossible. That is why in the choruses <lb/>
            at Lacedæmon the old men sing, <lb/>
            " We once were young and vigorous and strong," <lb/>
            and then the boys, <lb/>
            " We shall be stronger far than now we are," <lb/>
            and then the youths, <lb/>
            " We now are strong, look at us if you like." <note type="footnote"> I Fragments from the " Philoctetes " of Euripides. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="326"/>
            In this wise and statesmanlike manner did the legislator <lb/>
            exhibit to the young men the nearest and dearest examples <lb/>
            of what they should do in the persons of those who had <lb/>
            done so.</p>
          <p>§ xvi. Moreover it is not amiss sometimes, to awe and <lb/>
            repress and take down and tame the impudent and bold, to <lb/>
            boast and talk a little big about oneself. As Nestor did, to <lb/>
            mention him again, <lb/>
            " For I have mixed ere now with better men <lb/>
            Than both of you, and ne'er did they despise me."1 <lb/>
            So also Aristotle told Alexander that not only had they <lb/>
            that were rulers over many subjects a right to think highly <lb/>
            of themselves, but also those that had right views about <lb/>
            the gods. Useful too against our enemies and foes is the <lb/>
            following line, <lb/>
            " Ill-starred are they whose sons encounter me." 2 <lb/>
            Compare also the remark of Agesilaus about the king of <lb/>
            the Persians, who was called great, " How is he greater <lb/>
            than me, if he is not also more upright ? " And that also <lb/>
            of Epaminondas to the Lacedæmonians who were inveigh­ <lb/>
            ing against the Thebans, " Anyhow we have made you <lb/>
            talk at greater length than usual." But these kind of <lb/>
            remarks are fitting for enemies and foes; but our boasting <lb/>
            is also good on occasion for friends and fellow-citizens, <lb/>
            not only to abate their pride and make them more humble, <lb/>
            but also when they are in fear and dejection to raise them <lb/>
            up again and give them confidence. Thus Cyrus talked <lb/>
            big in perils and on battle-fields, though at other times he <lb/>
            was no boaster. And the second Antigonus, though he <lb/>
            was on all other occasions modest and far from vanity, <lb/>
            yet in the sea-fight off Cos, when one of his friends said to <lb/>
            him, " See you not how many more ships the enemy have <lb/>
            got than we have ? " answered, " How many do you make <lb/>
            me equal to then ?" This Homer also seems to have <lb/>
            noticed. For he has represented Odysseus, when his com­ <lb/>
            rades were dreadfully afraid of the noise and whirlpool of <lb/>
            Charybdis, reminding them of his former cleverness and <lb/>
            valour; <note type="footnote"> 1 Homer, "Iliad," i. 260, 261.</note> <note type="footnote">2 Homer, " Iliad," vi. 127. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="327"/>
            " We are in no worse plight than when the Cyclops <lb/>
            By force detained us in his hollow cave; <lb/>
            But even then, thanks to my valour, judgement, <lb/>
            And sense, we did escape." 1 <lb/>
            For such is not the self-praise of a demagogue or sophist, <lb/>
            or of one that asks for clapping or applause, but of one <lb/>
            who makes his valour and experience a pledge of confi­ <lb/>
            dence to his friends. For in critical conjunctures the repu­ <lb/>
            tation and credit of one who has experience and capacity in <lb/>
            command plays a great part in insuring safety.</p>
          <p>§ XVII. As I have said before, to pit oneself against <lb/>
            another's praise and reputation is by no means fitting for a <lb/>
            public man: however, in important matters, where mis­ <lb/>
            taken praise is injurious and detrimental, it is not amiss to <lb/>
            confute it, or rather to divert the hearer to what is better <lb/>
            by showing him the difference between true and false <lb/>
            merit. Anyone would be glad, I suppose, when vice was <lb/>
            abused and censured, to see most people voluntarily keep <lb/>
            aloof from it; but if vice should be well thought of, and <lb/>
            honour and reputation come to the person who promoted <lb/>
            its pleasures or desires, no nature is so well constituted or <lb/>
            strong that it would not be mastered by it. So the public <lb/>
            man must oppose the praise not of men but of bad actions, <lb/>
            for such praise is corrupting, and causes people to imitate <lb/>
            and emulate what is base as if it were noble. But it is best <lb/>
            refuted by putting it side by side with the truth: as <lb/>
            Theodorus the tragic actor is reported to have said once to <lb/>
            Satyrus the comic actor, " It is not so wonderful to make <lb/>
            an audience laugh as to make them weep and cry." But <lb/>
            what if some philosopher bad answered him, " To make an <lb/>
            audience weep and cry is not so noble a thing as to make <lb/>
            them forget their sorrows." This kind of self-laudation <lb/>
            benefits the hearer, and changes his opinion. Compare the <lb/>
            remark of Zeno in reference to the number of Theophrastus' <lb/>
            scholars, " His is a larger body, but mine are better <lb/>
            taught." And Phocion, when Leosthenes was still in pros­ <lb/>
            perity, being asked by the orators what benefit he had <lb/>
            conferred on the city, replied, " Only this, that during my <lb/>
            period of office there has been no funeral oration, but all <note type="footnote"> I Homer, " Odyssey," xii. 209-212. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="328"/>
            the dead have been buried in their fathers' sepulchres." <lb/>
            Wittily also did Crates parody the lines, <lb/>
            " Eating and wantonness and love's delights <lb/>
            Are all I value," <lb/>
            with <lb/>
            " Learning and those grand things the Muses teach one <lb/>
            Are all I value." <lb/>
            Such self-praise is good and useful and teaches people to <lb/>
            admire and love what is valuable and expedient instead of <lb/>
            what is vain and superfluous. Let so much suffice on the <lb/>
            question proposed.</p>
          <p>§ XVIII. It remains to me now to point out, what our <lb/>
            subject next demands and calls for, how everyone may avoid <lb/>
            unseasonable self-praise. For there is a wonderful incen­ <lb/>
            tive to talking about oneself in self-love, which is frequently <lb/>
            strongly implanted in those who seem to have only mode­ <lb/>
            rate aspirations for fame. For as it is one of the rules to <lb/>
            preserve good health to avoid altogether places where sick­ <lb/>
            ness is, or to exercise the greatest precaution if one must <lb/>
            go there, so talking about oneself has its slippery times and <lb/>
            places that draw it on on any pretext. For first, when others <lb/>
            are praised, as I said before, ambition makes people talk <lb/>
            about themselves, and a certain desire and impulse for fame <lb/>
            which is hard to check bites and tickles that ambition, <lb/>
            especially if the other person is praised for the same things <lb/>
            or less important things than the hearer thinks he is a pro­ <lb/>
            ficient in. For as hungry people have their appetite more <lb/>
            inflamed and sharpened by seeing others eat, so the praise <lb/>
            of one's neighbours makes those who eagerly desire fame <lb/>
            to blaze out into jealousy.</p>
          <p>§ xix. In the second place the narration of things done-. <lb/>
            successfully and to people's mind entices many unawares <lb/>
            to boasting and bragging in their joy ; for falling into con­ <lb/>
            versation about their victories, or success in state affairs, <lb/>
            or their words or deeds commended by great men, they <lb/>
            cannot keep themselves within bounds. With this kind of <lb/>
            self-laudation you may see that soldiers and sailors are <lb/>
            most taken. To be in this state of mind also frequently <lb/>
            happens to those who have returned from important posts <lb/>
            and responsible duties, for in their mention of illustrious <lb/>
             <pb n="329"/>
            men and men of royal rank they insert the encomiums they <lb/>
            have passed on themselves, and do not so much think <lb/>
            they are praising themselves as merely repeating the praises <lb/>
            of others about themselves. Others think their hearers do <lb/>
            not detect them at all of self-praise, when they recount the <lb/>
            greeting and welcome and kindness they have received <lb/>
            from kings and emperors, but only imagine them to be <lb/>
            enumerating the courtesy and kindliness of those great <lb/>
            personages. So we must be very much on our guard in <lb/>
            praising others to free ourselves from all suspicion of self- <lb/>
            love and self-recommendation, and not to seem to be really <lb/>
            praising ourselves under pretext of Patroclus." 1</p>
          <p>§ xx. Moreover that kind of conversation that mainly <lb/>
            consists of censuring and running down others is dangerous <lb/>
            as giving opportunity for self-laudation to those who pine <lb/>
            for fame. A fault into which old men especially fall, <lb/>
            when they are led to scold others and censure their bad <lb/>
            ways and faulty actions, and so extol themselves as being <lb/>
            remarkably the opposite. In old men we must allow all <lb/>
            this, especially if to age they add reputation and merit, for <lb/>
            such fault-finding is not without use, and inspires those who <lb/>
            are rebuked with both emulation and love of honour.2 <lb/>
            But all other persons must especially avoid and fear that <lb/>
            roundabout kind of self-praise. For since generally speak­ <lb/>
            ing censuring one's neighbours is disagreeable and barely <lb/>
            tolerable and requires great wariness, he that mixes up his <lb/>
            own praise with blame of another, and hunts for fame by <lb/>
            defaming another, is altogether tiresome and inspires dis­ <lb/>
            gust, for he seems to wish to get credit through trying to <lb/>
            prove others unworthy of credit.</p>
          <p>§ xxi. Furthermore, as those that are naturally prone <lb/>
            and inclined to laughter must be especially on their guard <lb/>
            against tickling and touching, such as excites that propen­ <lb/>
            sity by contact with the smoothest parts of the body, so <lb/>
            those that have a great passion for reputation ought to be <lb/>
            especially advised to abstain from praising themselves <lb/>
            when they are praised by others. For a person ought to <lb/>
            blush when praised, and not to be past blushing from <note type="footnote"> 1 An allusion to Homer, " Iliad," xix. 302. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Adopting the reading of Diibner. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="330"/>
            impudence, and ought to check those who extol him too <lb/>
            highly, and not to rebuke them for praising him too little; <lb/>
            though very many people do so, themselves prompting and <lb/>
            reminding their praisers of others of their own acts and <lb/>
            virtues, till by their own praise they spoil the effect of <lb/>
            the praise that others give them. For some tickle and <lb/>
            puff themselves up by self-praise, while others, malignantly <lb/>
            holding out the small bait of eulogy, provoke others to <lb/>
            talk about themselves, while others again ask questions <lb/>
            and put inquiries, as was done to the soldier in Menander, <lb/>
            merely to poke fun at him ; <lb/>
            " ' How did you get this wound ?' ' Sir, by a javelin.' <lb/>
            ' How in the name of Heaven ?' 'I was on <lb/>
            A scaling ladder fastened to a wall.' <lb/>
            I show my wound to them in serious earnest, <lb/>
            But they for their part only mock at me."</p>
          <p>§ XXII. As regards all these points then we must be on <lb/>
            our guard as much as possible not to launch out into praise <lb/>
            of ourselves, or yield to it in consequence of questions put <lb/>
            to us to draw us. And the best caution and security <lb/>
            against this is to pay attention to others who praise them­ <lb/>
            selves, and to consider how disagreeable and objectionable <lb/>
            the practice is to everybody, and that no other conversation <lb/>
            is so offensive and tiring. For though we cannot say that <lb/>
            we suffer any other evil at the hands of those who praise <lb/>
            themselves, yet being naturally bored by the practice, and <lb/>
            avoiding it, we are anxious to get rid of them and breathe <lb/>
            again; insomuch that even the flatterer and parasite and <lb/>
            needy person in his distress finds the rich man or satrap or <lb/>
            king praising himself hard to bear and wellnigh intolerable ; <lb/>
            and they say that having to listen to all this is paying a <lb/>
            very large shot to their entertainment, like the fellow in <lb/>
            Menander; <lb/>
            " To hear their foolish 1 saws, and soldier talk, <lb/>
            Such as this cursed braggart bellows forth, <lb/>
            Kills me; I get lean even at their feasts." <lb/>
            For as we may use this language not only about soldiers or <lb/>
            men who have newly become rich,2 who spin us a long <note type="footnote"> 1 Adopting the reading of Salmasius. </note><note type="footnote"> * Nouveaux riches, novi homines. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="331"/>
            yarn of their great and grand doings, being puffed up with <lb/>
            pride and talking big about themselves; if we remember <lb/>
            that the censure of others always follows our self-praise, <lb/>
            and that the end of this vain-glory is a bad repute, and <lb/>
            that, as Demosthenes says,1 the result will be that we shall <lb/>
            only tire our hearers, and not be thought what we profess <lb/>
            ourselves to be, we shall cease talking about ourselves, <lb/>
            unless by so doing we can bestow great benefit on ourselves <lb/>
            or our hearers.</p>

            <title type="sub">A discussion between Patrocleas, Plutarch, Timon, and Olympicus.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>§ I. When Epicurus had made these remarks, Quintus, <lb/>
            and before any of us who were at the end of the porch 2 <lb/>
            could reply, he went off abruptly. And we, marvelling <lb/>
            somewhat at his rudeness, stood still silently but looked at <lb/>
            one another, and then turned and pursued our walk as <lb/>
            before. And Patrocleas was the first to speak. " Are we," <lb/>
            said he, " to leave the question unanswered, or are we to <lb/>
            reply to his argument in his absence as if he were present ? " <lb/>
            Then said Timon, " Because he went off the moment he <lb/>
            had thrown his missile at us, it would not be good surely <lb/>
            to leave it sticking in us; for we are told that Brasidas <lb/>
            plucked the javelin that had been thrown at him out of <lb/>
            his body, and with it killed the hurler of it; but there is <lb/>
            of course no need for us to avenge ourselves so on those <lb/>
            that have launched on us an absurd or false argument, it <lb/>
            will be enough to dislodge the notion before it gets fixed in <lb/>
            us." Then said I, " Which of his words has moved you <note type="footnote"> I Demosthenes, " De Corona," p. 270. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 In the temple at Delphi, the scene of the discussion, as we <unclear>seo</unclear> <lb/>
            later on, §§ vii. xii. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="332"/>
            most? For the fellow seemed to rampage about, in his <lb/>
            anger and abusive language, with a long disconnected and <lb/>
            rambling rhapsody drawn from all sources, and at the same <lb/>
            time inveighed against Providence."</p>
          <p>§ II. Then said Patrocleas, " The slowness and delay of <lb/>
            the deity in punishing the wicked used to seem 1 to me a <lb/>
            very dreadful thing, but now in consequence of his speech <lb/>
            I come as it were new and fresh to the notion. Yet long <lb/>
            ago I was vexed when I heard that line of Euripides, <lb/>
            " He does delay, such is the Deity <lb/>
            In nature." 2 <lb/>
            For indeed it is not fitting that the deity should be slow in <lb/>
            anything, and least of all in the punishment of the wicked, <lb/>
            seeing that they are not slow or sluggish in doing evil, but <lb/>
            are hurried by their passions into crime at headlong speed. <lb/>
            Moreover, as Thucydides3 says, when punishment follows <lb/>
            as closely as possible upon wrong-doing, it blocks up the <lb/>
            road at once for those who would follow up their villainy <lb/>
            if it were successful. For no debt so much as that of <lb/>
            justice paid behind time damps the hopes and dejects the <lb/>
            mind of the wronged person, and aggravates the audacity <lb/>
            and daring of the wrong-doer; whereas the punishment <lb/>
            that follows crime immediately not only checks future out­ <lb/>
            breaks but is also the greatest possible comfort to the <lb/>
            injured. And so I am often troubled when I consider that <lb/>
            remark of Bias, who told, it seems, a bad man that he was <lb/>
            not afraid that he would escape punishment, but that he <lb/>
            would not live to see it. For how did the Messenians who <lb/>
            were killed long before derive any benefit from the punish­ <lb/>
            ment of Aristocrates ? For he had been guilty of treason <lb/>
            at the battle of The Great Trench, but had reigned over the <lb/>
            Arcadians for more than twenty years without being found <lb/>
            out, but afterwards was detected and paid the penalty, but <lb/>
            they were no longer alive.4 Or what consolation was <lb/>
            brought to the people of Orchomenus, who lost their sons <lb/>
            and friends and relatives in consequence of the treason of <note type="footnote"> 1 Reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐδόκει</foreign> with Reiske. </note><note type="footnote"> I Euripides," Orestes," 420.

            Lyciscus, by the disease which settled upon him long after­ <lb/>
            wards and spread all over his body ? For he used to go and <lb/>
            dip and soak his feet in the river, and uttered imprecations <lb/>
            and prayed that they might rot off if he was guilty of <lb/>
            treason or crime. Nor was it permitted to the children's <lb/>
            children of those that were slain to see at Athens the tear­ <lb/>
            ing out of their graves the bodies of those atrocious crimi­ <lb/>
            nals that had killed them, and the carrying them beyond <lb/>
            their borders. And so it seems strange in Euripides using <lb/>
            the following argument to deter people from vice : <lb/>
            " Fear not, for vengeance will not strike at once <lb/>
            Your heart, or that of any guilty wretch, <lb/>
            But silently and with slow foot it moves,1 <lb/>
            And when their time's come will the wicked reach." <lb/>
            This is no doubt the very reason why the wicked incite <lb/>
            and cheer themselves on to commit lawless acts, for crime <lb/>
            shows them a fruit visible and ripe at once, but a punish­ <lb/>
            ment late, and long subsequent to the enjoyment."</p>
          <p>§ III. When Patrocleas had said thus much, Olympicus <lb/>
            interfered, " There is another consideration, Patrocleas, the <lb/>
            great absurdity involved in these delays and longsuffering <lb/>
            of the deity. For the slowness of punishment takes away <lb/>
            belief in providence, and the wicked, observing that no <lb/>
            evil follows each crime except long afterwards, attri­ <lb/>
            bute it when it comes to mischance, and look upon it <lb/>
            in the light more of accident than punishment, and so <lb/>
            receive no benefit from it, being grieved indeed when the <lb/>
            misfortune comes, but feeling no remorse for what they <lb/>
            have done amiss. For, as in the case of a horse, the whip­ <lb/>
            ping or spurring that immediately follows upon a stumble <lb/>
            or some other fault is a corrective and brings him to his <lb/>
            duty, but pulling and backing him with the bit and shouting <lb/>
            at him long afterwards seems to come from some other <lb/>
            motive than a desire to teach him, for he is put to pain <lb/>
            without being shown his fault; so the vice which each time <lb/>
            it stumbles or offends is at once punished and checked by <lb/>
            correction is most likely2 to coma to itself and be humble <note type="footnote"> 1 Compare Petronius," Satyricon," 44: " Dii pedes lanatos habent." <lb/>

            and stand in awe of the deity, as one that beholds men's <lb/>
            acts and passions and does not punish behind time; whereas <lb/>
            that justice that, according to Euripides, " steals on silently <lb/>
            and with slow foot," and falls upon the wicked some time <lb/>
            or other, seems to resemble more chance than providence <lb/>
            by reason of its uncertainty, delay, and irregularity. So <lb/>
            that I do not see what benefit there is in those mills of the <lb/>
            gods that are said to grind late,1 since they obscure the <lb/>
            punishment, and obliterate the fear, of evil-doing."</p>
          <p>§ iv. When Olympicus had done speaking, and I was <lb/>
            musing with myself on the matter, Tim on said, " Am I to <lb/>
            put the finishing touch of difficulty on our subject, or am I <lb/>
            to let him first contend earnestly against these views ? " <lb/>
            Then said I, " Why should we bring up the third wave 2 <lb/>
            and drown the argument, if he is not able to refute or <lb/>
            evade the charges already brought ? To begin then with the <lb/>
            domestic hearth, as the saying is,3 let us imitate that <lb/>
            cautious manner of speaking about the deity in vogue <lb/>
            among the Academic philosophers, and decline to speak <lb/>
            about these things as if we thoroughly understood them. <lb/>
            For it is worse in us mortals than for people ignorant of <lb/>
            music to discuss music, or for people ignorant of military <lb/>
            matters to discuss the art of war, to examine too closely into <lb/>
            the nature of the gods and demons, like people with no <lb/>
            knowledge of art trying to get at the intention of artists <lb/>
            from opinion and fancy and probabilities. For if4 it is <lb/>
            no easy matter for anyone not a professional to conjecture <lb/>
            why the surgeon performed an operation later rather <lb/>
            than sooner, or why he ordered his patient to take a <lb/>
            bath to-day rather than yesterday, how is it easy or safe <lb/>
            for a mortal to say anything else about the deity than that <lb/>
            he knows best the time to cure vice, and applies to each <lb/>
            his punishment as the doctor administers a drug, and that <lb/>
            a punishment not of the same magnitude, or applied at the <lb/>
            same time, in all cases. For that the cure of the soul, <lb/>
            which is called justice, is the greatest of all arts is testified <note type="footnote"> 1 An allusion to the proverb "<foreign xml:lang="grc">Οψε Θεω̃ν ἀλέουσι μύλοι, ἀλέουσι δὲ λεπτά</foreign>. <lb/>

            by Pindar as well as by ten thousand others, for be calls <lb/>
            God, the ruler and lord of all things, the greatest artificer <lb/>
            as the creator of justice, whose function it is to determine <lb/>
            when, and how, and how far, each bad man is to be <lb/>
            punished. And Plato says that Minos, the son of Zeus, <lb/>
            was his father's pupil in this art, not thinking it possible <lb/>
            that any one could succeed in justice, or understand how <lb/>
            to succeed in it, without he had learned or somehow got <lb/>
            that science. For the laws which men make are not always <lb/>
            merely reasonable, nor is their meaning always apparent, <lb/>
            but some injunctions seem quite ridiculous, for example, <lb/>
            the Ephors at Lacedæmon make proclamation, directly <lb/>
            they take office, that no one is to let his moustache grow, <lb/>
            but that all are to obey the laws, that they be not grievous <lb/>
            to them. And the Romans lay a light rod on the bodies <lb/>
            of those they make freemen, and when they make their <lb/>
            wills, they nominate some as their heirs, while to others <lb/>
            they sell the property, which seems strange. But strangest <lb/>
            of all is that ordinance of Solon, that the citizen who, when <lb/>
            his city is in faction, will not side with either party is to <lb/>
            lose his civic rights. And generally one might mention <lb/>
            many absurdities in laws, if one did not know the mind of <lb/>
            the legislator, or understand the reason for each particular <lb/>
            piece of legislation. How is it wonderful then, if human <lb/>
            affairs are so difficult to comprehend, that it is no easy <lb/>
            task to say in connection with the gods, why they punish <lb/>
            some offenders early, and others late ?</p>
          <p>§ v. This is not a pretext for evading the subject, but <lb/>
            merely a request for lenient judgement, that our discourse, <lb/>
            looking as it were for a haven and place of refuge, may rise <lb/>
            to the difficulty with greater confidence basing itself on <lb/>
            probability. Consider then first that, according to Plato, <lb/>
            god, making himself openly a pattern of all things good, <lb/>
            concedes human virtue, which is in some sort a resem­ <lb/>
            blance to himself, to those who are able to follow him. <lb/>
            For all nature, being in disorder, got the principle of change <lb/>
            and became order1 by a resemblance to and participation <lb/>
            in the nature and virtue of the deity. The same Plato <lb/>
            also tells us that nature put eyesight into us, in order that <note type="footnote"> 1 Or a world. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="336"/>
            the soul by beholding and admiring the heavenly bodies <lb/>
            might accustom itself to welcome and love harmony and <lb/>
            order, and might hate disorderly and roving propensities, <lb/>
            and avoid aimless reliance on chance, as the parent of all <lb/>
            vice and error. For man can enjoy no greater blessing <lb/>
            from god than to attain to virtue by the earnest imitation <lb/>
            of the noblest qualities of the divine nature. And so he <lb/>
            punishes the wicked leisurely and long after, not being <lb/>
            afraid of error or after repentance through punishing too <lb/>
            hastily, but to take away from us that eager and brutish <lb/>
            thirst for revenge, and to teach us that we are not to reta­ <lb/>
            liate on those that have offended us in anger, and when the <lb/>
            soul is most inflamed and distorted with passion and almost <lb/>
            beside itself for rage, like people satisfying fierce thirst or <lb/>
            hunger, but to imitate the mildness and long-suffering of <lb/>
            the deity, and to avenge ourselves in an orderly and decent <lb/>
            manner, only when we have taken counsel with time long <lb/>
            enough to give us the least possible likelihood of after <lb/>
            repentance. For it is a smaller evil, as Socrates said, to <lb/>
            drink dirty water when excessively thirsty, than, when <lb/>
            one's mind is disturbed and full of rage and fury, before it <lb/>
            is settled and becomes pure, to glut our revenge on the <lb/>
            person of a relation and kinsman. For it is not the punish­ <lb/>
            ment that follows as closely as possible upon wrong-doing, <lb/>
            as Thucydides said,1 but that which is more remote, that <lb/>
            observes decorum. For as Melanthius says of anger, <lb/>
            " Fell things it does when it the mind unsettles," 2 <lb/>
            so also reason acts with justice and moderation, when it <lb/>
            banishes rage and passion. So also people are made milder <lb/>
            by the example of other men, as when they hear that Plato, <lb/>
            when he held his stick over his slave to correct him, waited <lb/>
            some time, as he himself has told us, to compose his anger; <lb/>
            and that Archytas, having learned of some wrong or dis­ <lb/>
            orderly action on the part of some of his farm labourers, <lb/>
            knowing that at the time be was in a very great rage and <lb/>
            highly incensed at them, did nothing to them, but merely <lb/>
            departed, saying, " You may thank your stars that I am in <note type="footnote"> I See above, § ii. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Quoled also in " On restraining Anger," § ii. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="337"/>
            a rnge with you." If then the remembrance of the words <lb/>
            and recorded acts of men abates the fierceness and intensity <lb/>
            of our rage, much more likely is it that we (observing that <lb/>
            the deity, though without either fear or repentance in any <lb/>
            case, yet puts off his punishments and defers them for some <lb/>
            time) shall be reserved in our views about such matters, <lb/>
            and shall think that mildness and long-suffering which the <lb/>
            god exhibits a divine part of virtue, reforming a few by <lb/>
            speedy punishment, but benefiting and correcting many <lb/>
            by a tardy one.</p>
          <p>§ VI. Let us consider in the second place that punish­ <lb/>
            ments inflicted by men for offences regard only retaliation, <lb/>
            and, when the offender is punished, stop and go no further; <lb/>
            so that they seem to follow offences yelping at them like a <lb/>
            dog, and closely pursuing at their heels as it were. But it <lb/>
            is likely that the deity would look at the state of any guilty <lb/>
            soul that he intended to punish, if haply it might turn and <lb/>
            repent, and would give1 time for reformation to all whose <lb/>
            vice was not absolute and incurable. For knowing bow <lb/>
            great a share of virtue souls come into the world with, <lb/>
            deriving it from him, and how strong and lasting is their <lb/>
            nobility of nature, and how it breaks out into vice against <lb/>
            its natural disposition through the corruption of bad habits <lb/>
            and companions, and afterwards in some cases reforms itself, <lb/>
            and recovers its proper position, he does not inflict punish­ <lb/>
            ment on all persons alike; but the incorrigible he at once <lb/>
            removes from life and cuts off, since it is altogether in­ <lb/>
            jurious to others, but most of all to a man's own self, to <lb/>
            live in perpetual vice, whereas to those who seem to have <lb/>
            fallen into wrong-doing, rather from ignorance of what was <lb/>
            good than from deliberate choice of what was bad, he gives <lb/>
            time to repent. But if they persist in vice he punishes them <lb/>
            too, for he has no fear that they will escape him. Consider <lb/>
            also how many changes take place in the life and character <lb/>
            of men, so that the Greeks give the names <foreign xml:lang="grc">τρόπος</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἦθος</foreign> <lb/>
            to the character, the first word meaning change, and the <lb/>
            latter the immense force and power of habit. I think also <lb/>
            that the ancients called Cecrops half man and half dragon2 <note type="footnote"> 1 It seems necessary to read either <foreign xml:lang="grc">πορίζειν</foreign> with Mez, or <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁρίζειν</foreign> with <lb/>
            Wy ttenbach. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Compare Aristophanes, " Vespæ," 438. </note> <note type="footnote"> z </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="338"/>
            not because, as some say, he became from a good king wild <lb/>
            and dragon-like, but contrariwise because he was originally <lb/>
            perverse and terrible, and afterwards became a mild and <lb/>
            humane king. And if this is uncertain, at any rate we know <lb/>
            that Gelon and Hiero, both Sicilians, and Pisistratus the <lb/>
            son of Hippocrates, though they got their supreme power by <lb/>
            bad means, yet used it for virtuous ends, and though they <lb/>
            mounted the throne in an irregular way, yet became good and <lb/>
            useful princes. For by good legislation and by encouraging <lb/>
            agriculture they made the citizens earnest and industrious <lb/>
            instead of scoffers and chatterers. As for Gelon, after <lb/>
            fighting valiantly and defeating the Carthaginians in a great <lb/>
            battle, he would not conclude with them the peace they <lb/>
            asked for until they inserted an article promising to cease <lb/>
            sacrificing their sons to Cronos. And Lydiades was tyrant <lb/>
            in Megalopolis, yet in the very height of his power chang­ <lb/>
            ing his ideas and being disgusted with injustice, he re­ <lb/>
            stored their old constitution to the citizens,1 and fell glo­ <lb/>
            riously, fighting against the enemy in behalf of his country. <lb/>
            And if any one had slain prematurely Miltiades the tyrant <lb/>
            of the Chersonese, or had prosecuted and got a conviction <lb/>
            against Cimon for incest with his sister, or had deprived <lb/>
            Athens of Themistocles for his wantonness and revellings <lb/>
            and outrages in the market, as in later days Athens lost Alci­ <lb/>
            biades, by an indictment, should we not have had to go <lb/>
            without the glory of Marathon, and Eurymedon, and <lb/>
            beautiful Artemisium, " where the Athenian youth laid the <lb/>
            bright base of liberty ?"2 For great natures produce <lb/>
            nothing little, nor can their energy and activity rust owing <lb/>
            to their keen intellect, but they toss to and fro as at sea <lb/>
            till they come to a settled and durable character. As then <lb/>
            one inexperienced in farming, seeing a spot full of thick <lb/>
            bushes and rank growth, full of wild beasts and streams <lb/>
            and mud, would not think much of it, while to one who <lb/>
            has learnt how to discriminate and discern between different <lb/>
            kind of soils all these are various tokens of the richness and <lb/>
            goodness of the land, so great natures break out into many <lb/>
            strange excesses, which exasperate us at first beyond bear­ <lb/>
            ing, so that we think it right to cut off such offenders and <note type="footnote"> 1 See Pausanias, vili. 27. 2 Pindar. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="339"/>
            stop their career at once, whereas a better judge, seeing <lb/>
            the good and noble even in these, waits for age and the <lb/>
            season which nature appoints for gathering fruit to bring <lb/>
            sense and virtue.</p>
          <p>§ vii. So much for this point. Do you not think also <lb/>
            that some of the Greeks did well to adopt that Egyptian <lb/>
            law which orders a pregnant woman condemned to death <lb/>
            not to suffer the penalty till after she has given birth ? " <lb/>
            " Certainly," said all the company. I continued, " Put the <lb/>
            case not of a woman pregnant, but of a man who can in <lb/>
            process of time bring to light and reveal some secret act <lb/>
            or plan, point out some unknown evil, or devise some <lb/>
            scheme of safety, or invent something useful and necessary, <lb/>
            would it not be better to defer his execution, and wait the <lb/>
            result of his meditation ? That is my opinion, at least." <lb/>
            " So we all think," said Patrocleas. " Quite right," said I. <lb/>
            " For do but consider, had Dionysius had vengeance taken <lb/>
            on him at the beginning of his tyranny, none of the Greeks <lb/>
            would have dwelt in Sicily, which was laid waste by the <lb/>
            Carthaginians. Nor would the Greeks have dwelt in <lb/>
            Apollonia, or Anactorium, or the peninsula of the Leuca­ <lb/>
            dians, had not Periander's chastisement been postponed for <lb/>
            a long time. I think also that Cassander's punishment <lb/>
            was deferred that Thebes might be repeopled. And of the <lb/>
            mercenaries that plundered this very temple most crossed <lb/>
            . over into Sicily with Timoleon, and after they had con­ <lb/>
            quered the Carthaginians and put down their authority, <lb/>
            perished miserably, miserable wretches that they were. For <lb/>
            no doubt the deity makes use of some wicked men, as exe­ <lb/>
            cutioners, to punish others, and so I think he crashes as it <lb/>
            were most tyrants. For as the gall of the hyena and <lb/>
            rennet of the seal, both nasty beasts in all other respects, <lb/>
            are useful in certain diseases, so when some need sharp <lb/>
            correction, the deity casts upon them the implacable fury <lb/>
            of some tyrant, or the savage ferocity of some prince, and <lb/>
            does not remove the bane and trouble till their fault be got <lb/>
            rid of and purged. Such a potion was Phalaris to the <lb/>
            Agrigentines, and Marius to the Romans. And to the <lb/>
            people of Sicyon the god distinctly foretold that their city <lb/>
            needed a scourge, when they took away from the Cleonæans <lb/>
            (as if he was a Sicyonian) the lad Teletias, who was crowned <lb/>
             <pb n="340"/>
            in the Pythian games, and tore him to pieces. As for the <lb/>
            Sicyonians, Orthagoras became their tyrant, and subse­ <lb/>
            quently Myro and Clisthenes, and these three checked their <lb/>
            wanton outbreaks; but the Cleonæans, not getting such a <lb/>
            cure, went to ruin. Yon have of course heard Homer's <lb/>
            lines, <lb/>
            " ' From a bad father sprang a son far better, <lb/>
            Excelling in all virtue; " <lb/>
            and yet that son of Copreus never performed any brilliant <lb/>
            or notable action : but the descendants of Sisyphus and <lb/>
            Autolycus and Phlegyas flourished in the glory and virtues <lb/>
            of great kings. Pericles also sprang of a family under a <lb/>
            curse,2 and Pompey the Great at Rome was the son of <lb/>
            Pompeius Strabo, whose dead body the Roman people cast <lb/>
            out and trampled upon, so great was their hatred of him. <lb/>
            How is it strange then, since the farmer does not cut down <lb/>
            the thorn till he has taken his asparagus, nor do the <lb/>
            Libyans burn the twigs till they have gathered the <lb/>
            ledanum, that god does not exterminate the wicked and <lb/>
            rugged root of an illustrious and royal race till it has <lb/>
            produced its fit fruit ? For it would have been better for <lb/>
            the Phocians to have lost ten thousand of the oxen and <lb/>
            horses of Iphitus, and for more gold and silver to have <lb/>
            gone from Delphi, than that Odysseus and Æsculapius <lb/>
            should not have been born, nor those others who from <lb/>
            bad and wicked men became good and useful."</p>
          <p>§ VIlI. " And do you not all think that it is better that <lb/>
            punishment should take place at the fitting time and in <lb/>
            the fitting manner rather than quickly and on the spur of <lb/>
            the moment ? Consider the case of Callippus, who with the <lb/>
            very dagger with which be slew Dion, pretending to be his <lb/>
            friend, was afterwards slain by his own friends. And when <lb/>
            Mitius the Argive was killed in a tumult, a brazen statue <lb/>
            in the market-place fell on his murderer and killed him <lb/>
            during the public games. And of course, Patrocleas, <lb/>
            you know all about Bessus the Pæonian, and about Aristo <lb/>
            the Œtæan leader of mercenaries." " Not I, by Zeus," <lb/>
            said Patrocleas, "but I should like to hear." "Aristo," I <note type="footnote">1 Homer, "Iliad," xv. 641, 642.</note> <note type="footnote">2 See Thucydides, i. 127. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="341"/>
            continued, " at the permission of the tyrants removed the <lb/>
            necklace of Eriphyle1 which was hung up in this temple, <lb/>
            and took it to his wife as a present; but his son being <lb/>
            angry with his mother for some reason or other, set the <lb/>
            house on fire, and burnt all that were in it. As for <lb/>
            Bessus, it seems be had killed his father, though his <lb/>
            crime was long undiscovered. But at last going to sup <lb/>
            with some strangers, he knocked down a nest of swallows, <lb/>
            pricking it with his lance, and killed all the young swal­ <lb/>
            lows. And when the company said, as it was likely they <lb/>
            would, * Whatever makes you act in such a strange man­ <lb/>
            ner?' 'Have they not,' he replied, ' been long bearing <lb/>
            false witness against me, crying out that I had killed my <lb/>
            father ? ' And the company, astonished at his answer, laid <lb/>
            the matter before the king, and the affair was inquired into, <lb/>
            and Bessus punished."</p>
          <p>§ ix. " These cases," I continued, " we cite supposing, as <lb/>
            has been laid down, that there is a deferring of punish­ <lb/>
            ment to the wicked; and, for the rest, I think we ought <lb/>
            to listen to Hesiod, who tells us—not like Plato, who <lb/>
            asserts that punishment is a condition that follows crime— <lb/>
            that it is contemporaneous with it, and grows with it from <lb/>
            the same source and root. For Hesiod says, <lb/>
            " Evil advice is worst to the adviser;" 2 <lb/>
            and, <lb/>
            " He who plots mischief 'gainst another brings <lb/>
            It first on his own pate." 3 <lb/>
            The cantharis is said to have in itself the antidote to its own <lb/>
            sting, but wickedness, creating its own pain and torment, <lb/>
            pays the penalty of its misdeeds not afterwards but at the <lb/>
            time of its ill-doing. And as every malefactor about to <lb/>
            pay the penalty of his crime in his person bears his cross, <lb/>
            so vice fabricates for itself each of its own torments, being <lb/>
            the terrible author of its own misery in life, wherein in <lb/>
            addition to shame it has frequent fears and fierce passions <lb/>
            and endless remorse and anxiety. But some are just <note type="footnote"> I See Pausanias, v. 17 ; viii. 24; ix. 41 ; x. 29. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Hesiod, " Works and Days," 266. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Ibid. 265.

             <pb n="342"/>
            like children, who, seeing malefactors in the theatres in <lb/>
            golden tunics and purple robes with crowns on and dancing, <lb/>
            admire them and marvel at them, thinking them happy, <lb/>
            till they see them goaded and lashed and issuing fire from <lb/>
            their gaudy but cheap garments.1 For most wicked people, <lb/>
            though they have great households and conspicuous offices <lb/>
            and great power, are yet being secretly punished before <lb/>
            they are seen to be murdered or hurled down rocks, which <lb/>
            is rather the climax and end of their punishment than the <lb/>
            punishment itself. For as Plato tells us that Herodicus the <lb/>
            Selymbrian having fallen into consumption, an incurable <lb/>
            disease, was the first of mankind to mix exercise with the <lb/>
            art of healing, and so prolonged his own life and that of <lb/>
            others suffering from the same disease, so those wicked <lb/>
            persons who seem to avoid immediate punishment, receive <lb/>
            a longer and not slower punishment, not later but extend­ <lb/>
            ing over a wider period; for they are not punished in their <lb/>
            old age, but rather grow old in perpetual punishment. I <lb/>
            speak of course of long time as a human being, for to the <lb/>
            gods all the period of man's life is as nothing, and so to <lb/>
            them ' now and not thirty years ago' means no more than <lb/>
            with us torturing or hanging a malefactor in the evening <lb/>
            instead of the morning would mean ; especially as man is <lb/>
            shut up in life as in a prison from which there is no egress <lb/>
            or escape, and though doubtless during his life he has <lb/>
            much feasting and business and gifts and favours and <lb/>
            amusement, yet, just like people playing at dice or draughts <lb/>
            in a prison, the rope is all the time hanging over his <lb/>
            head."2</p>
          <p>§ x. " And indeed what prevents our asserting that people <lb/>
            in prison under sentence of death are not punished till their <lb/>
            heads are cut off, or that the person who has taken hemlock, <lb/>
            and walks about till he feels it is getting into his legs, suffers <lb/>
            not at all till he is deprived of sensation by the freezing <lb/>
            and curdling of his blood, if we consider the last moment <lb/>
            of punishment all the punishment, and ignore all the inter­ <lb/>
            mediate sufferings and fears and anxiety and remorse, the <note type="footnote"> 1 " Significat martyres Christianos, in tunica molesta fumantes."— <lb/>

            destiny of every guilty wretch ? That would be arguing <lb/>
            that the fish that has swallowed the hook is not caught, <lb/>
            till we see it boiled by the cook or sliced at table. For <lb/>
            every wrong-doer is liable to punishment, and soon <lb/>
            swallows the pleasantness of his wrong-doing like a bait, <lb/>
            while his conscience still vexes and troubles him, <lb/>
            " As through the sea the impetuous tunny darts." <lb/>
            For the recklessness and audacity of vice is strong and ram­ <lb/>
            pant till the crime is committed, but afterwards, when the <lb/>
            passion subsides like a storm, it becomes timid and dejected <lb/>
            and a prey to fears and superstitions. So that Stesichorus <lb/>
            in his account of Clytæmnestra's dream may have repre­ <lb/>
            sented the facts and real state of the case, where he says, <lb/>
            " A dragon seemed to appear to her with its lofty head <lb/>
            smeared all over with blood, and out of it seemed to come <lb/>
            king Orestes the grandson of Plisthenes." For visions in <lb/>
            dreams, and apparitions during the day, and oracles, and <lb/>
            lightning, and whatever is thought to come from the deity, <lb/>
            bring tempests of apprehension to the guilty. So they <lb/>
            say that one time Apollodorus in a dream saw himself <lb/>
            flayed by the Scythians, and then boiled, and that his <lb/>
            heart out of the caldron spoke to him in a low voice and <lb/>
            said, "I am the cause of this;" and at another time he <lb/>
            dreamed that he saw his daughters running round him in <lb/>
            a circle all on fire and in flames. And Hipparchus the son <lb/>
            of Pisistratus, a little before his death, dreamt that Aphro­ <lb/>
            dite threw some blood on his face out of a certain phial. <lb/>
            And the friends of Ptolemy Ceraunus dreamed that be was <lb/>
            summoned for trial by Seleucus, and that the judges were <lb/>
            vultures and wolves, who tore his flesh and distributed it <lb/>
            wholesale among his enemies. And Pausanias at Byzan­ <lb/>
            tium, having sent for Cleonice a free-born maiden, intend­ <lb/>
            ing to outrage her and pass the night with her, being <lb/>
            seized with some alarm or suspicion killed her, and fre­ <lb/>
            quently saw her in his dreams saying to him, " Come near <lb/>
            for judgement, lust is most assuredly a grievous bane to <lb/>
            men," and as this apparition did not cease, he sailed, it <lb/>
            seems, to Heraclea to the place where the souls of the dead <lb/>
            could be summoned, and by propitiations and sacrifices <lb/>
            called up the soul of the maiden, and she appeared to him <lb/>
             <pb n="344"/>
            and told him that this trouble would end when he got to <lb/>
            Lacedæmon, and directly he got there he died."1</p>
          <p>§ xi. " And so, if nothing happens to the soul after death, <lb/>
            but that event is the end of all enjoyment or punishment, <lb/>
            one would be rather inclined to say that the deity was <lb/>
            lax and indulgent in quickly punishing the wicked and <lb/>
            depriving them of life. For even if we were to say that <lb/>
            the wicked had no other trouble in a long life, yet, when <lb/>
            their wrong-doing was proved to bring them no profit or <lb/>
            enjoyment, no good or adequate return for their many and <lb/>
            great anxieties, the consciousness of that would be quite <lb/>
            enough to throw 2 their mind off its balance. So they record <lb/>
            of Lysimachus tint he was so overcome by thirst that he <lb/>
            surrendered himself and his forces to the Getæ for some <lb/>
            drink, but after he had drunk and bethought him that he <lb/>
            was now a captive, he said, " Alas ! How guilty am I for <lb/>
            so brief a gratification to lose so great a kingdom !" And <lb/>
            yet it is very difficult to resist a necessity of nature. But <lb/>
            when a man, either for the love of money, or for political <lb/>
            place or power, or carried away by some amorous propen­ <lb/>
            sity, does some lawless and dreadful deed, and, after his <lb/>
            eager desire is satisfied, sees in process of time that only <lb/>
            the base and terrible elements of his crime remain, while <lb/>
            nothing useful, or necessary, or advantageous has flowed <lb/>
            from it, is it not likely that the idea would often present <lb/>
            itself to him that, moved by vain-glory, or for some illiberal <lb/>
            and unlovely pleasure, he bad violated the greatest and <lb/>
            noblest rights of mankind, and had filled his life with <lb/>
            shame and trouble ? For as Simonides used to say play­ <lb/>
            fully that he always found his money-chest full but his <lb/>
            gratitude-chest empty,3 so the wicked contemplating their <lb/>
            own vice soon find out that their gratification is joyless <lb/>
            and hopeless,4 and ever attended by fears and griefs and <lb/>
            gloomy memories, and suspicions about the future, and dis­ <lb/>
            trust about the present. Thus we hear Ino, repenting for <lb/>
            what she had done, saying on the stage, <note type="footnote"> 1 See also Pausanias, iii. 17. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Surely <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄν ἀνατρέποι</foreign> must be read. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Compare " On Curiosity," § x. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 The reading is very doubtful.

            " Dear women, would that I could now inhabit <lb/>
            For the first time the house of Athamas, <lb/>
            Guiltless of any of my awful deeds! "I <lb/>
            It is likely that the soul of every wicked person will medi­ <lb/>
            tate in this way, and consider how it can escape the memory <lb/>
            of its ill-deeds, and lay its conscience to sleep, and become <lb/>
            pure, and live another life over again from the beginning. <lb/>
            For there is no confidence, or reality, or continuance, or <lb/>
            security, in what wickedness proposes to itself, unless by <lb/>
            Zeus we shall say that evil-doers are wise, but wherever the <lb/>
            greedy love of wealth or pleasure or violent envy dwells <lb/>
            with hatred and malignity, there will you also see and find <lb/>
            stationed superstition, and remissness for labour, and <lb/>
            cowardice in respect to death, and sudden caprice in the <lb/>
            passions, and vain-glory and boasting. Those that censure <lb/>
            them frighten them, and they even fear those that praise <lb/>
            them as wronged by their deceit, and as most hostile to the <lb/>
            bad because they readily praise those they think good. <lb/>
            For as in the case of ill-tempered steel the hardness of vice <lb/>
            is rotten, and its strength easily shattered. So that in <lb/>
            course of time, understanding their real selves, they are <lb/>
            vexed and disgusted with their past life and abhor it. For <lb/>
            if a bad man who restores property entrusted to his care, <lb/>
            or becomes surety for a friend, or contributes very gene­ <lb/>
            rously and liberally to his country out of love of glory or <lb/>
            honour, at once repents and is sorry for what he has done <lb/>
            from the fickleness and changeableness of his mind; and if <lb/>
            men applauded in the theatres directly afterwards groan, <lb/>
            their love of glory subsiding into love of money; shall we <lb/>
            suppose that those who sacrificed men to tyrannies and con­ <lb/>
            spiracies as Apollodorus did, or that those who robbed <lb/>
            their friends of money as Glaucus the son of Epicydes did,2 <lb/>
            never repented, or loathed themselves, or regretted their <lb/>
            past misdeeds ?For my part, if it is lawful to say so, I do <lb/>
            not think evil-doers need any god or man to punish them, <lb/>
            for the marring and troubling of all their life by vice is in <lb/>
            itself adequate punishment."</p>
          <p>§ XII. " But consider now whether I have not spoken too <lb/>
            long." Then Timon said, " Perhaps you have, considering <note type="footnote"> 1 Euripides, “ Ino.” 2 See Herodotus, vi. 86 ; Juvenul, xiii. 199-207. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="346"/>
            what remains and the time it will take. For now I am <lb/>
            going to start the last question, as if it were a combatant <lb/>
            in reserve, since the other two questions have been debated <lb/>
            sufficiently. For as to the charge and bold accusation that <lb/>
            Euripides brings against the gods, for visiting the sins of <lb/>
            the parents upon the children, consider that even those of <lb/>
            us who are silent agree with Euripides. For if the guilty <lb/>
            were punished themselves there would be no further need <lb/>
            to punish the innocent, for it is not fair to punish even the <lb/>
            guilty twice for the same offence, whereas if the gods <lb/>
            through easiness remit the punishment of the wicked, <lb/>
            and exact it later on from the innocent, they do not well <lb/>
            to compensate for their tardiness by injustice. Such con­ <lb/>
            duct resembles the story told of Æsop’s coming to this <lb/>
            very spot,1 with money from Crœsus, to offer a splendid <lb/>
            sacrifice to the god, and to give four minæ to each of the <lb/>
            Delphians. And some quarrel or difference belike ensuing <lb/>
            between him and the Delphians here, he offered the sacri­ <lb/>
            fice, but sent the money back to Sardis, as though the <lb/>
            Delphians were not worthy to receive that benefit, so they <lb/>
            fabricated against him a charge of sacrilege, and put him <lb/>
            to death by throwing him headlong down yonder rock <lb/>
            called Hyampia. And in consequence the god is said to <lb/>
            have been wroth with them, and to have brought dearth on <lb/>
            their land, and all kinds of strange diseases, so that they <lb/>
            went round at the public festivals of the Greeks, and in­ <lb/>
            vited by proclamation whoever wished to take satisfaction <lb/>
            of them for Æsop's death. And three generations after­ <lb/>
            wards came Idmon 2 a Samian, no relation of Æsop's, but <lb/>
            a descendant of those who had purchased Æsop as a slave <lb/>
            at Samos, and by giving him satisfaction the Delphians got <lb/>
            rid of their trouble. And it was in consequence of this, <lb/>
            they say, that the punishment of those guilty of sacrilege <lb/>
            was transferred from Hyampia to Nauplia.3 And even <lb/>
            great lovers of Alexander, as we are, do not praise his <lb/>
            destroying the city of the Branchidæ and putting everybody <lb/>

            cuse, laughing and jeering at the Corcyræans for asking <lb/>
            him why he wasted their island, replied, “ Because, by <lb/>
            Zens, your forefathers welcomed Odysseus." And when <lb/>
            the people of Ithaca likewise complained of his soldiers <lb/>
            carrying off their sheep, he said, " Your king came to us, <lb/>
            and actually put out the shepherd's eye to boot.”2 And is <lb/>
            it not stranger still in Apollo punishing the present inha­ <lb/>
            bitants of Pheneus, by damming up the channel dug to <lb/>
            carry off their watery and so flooding the whole of their <lb/>
            district, because a thousand years ago, they say, Hercules <lb/>
            carried off to Pheneus the oracular tripod ? and in telling <lb/>
            the Sybarites that the only end of their troubles would be <lb/>
            propitiating by their ruin on three occasions the wrath of <lb/>
            Leucadian Hera ? And indeed it is no long time since the <lb/>
            Locrians have ceased sending maidens4 to Troy, <lb/>

            all because Ajax violated Cassandra. Where is the reason <lb/>
            or justice in all this? Nor do we praise the Thracians <lb/>

            wives ;5 nor the barbarians on the banks of the Eridanus <lb/>

            lived five or ten generations after his tragic death had <lb/>

            he would introduce more and greater absurdities, I asked <lb/>
            him, " Well, do you believe all this to be true ? " And he <lb/>
            replied, " If not all, but only some, of it is true, do you not <lb/>
            think that the subject presents the same difficulty?" <lb/>
            " Perhaps," said I, "it is as with those in a raging fever, <lb/>
            whether they have few or many clothes on the bed they are <lb/>
            equally hot or nearly so, yet to ease them we shall do well <lb/>
            to remove some of the clothes ; but let us waive this point, <lb/>
            if you don't like the line of argument, though a good deal <lb/>
            of what you have said seems myth and fable, and let us <lb/>
            recall to our minds the recent festival in honour of Apollo <lb/>
            called Theoxenia,1 and the noble share in it which the <lb/>
            heralds expressly reserve for the descendants of Pindar, <lb/>
            and how grand and pleasant it seemed to you." " Who <lb/>
            could help being pleased," said he, " with such a delightful <lb/>
            honour, so Greek and breathing the simple spirit of an­ <lb/>
            tiquity, had he not, to use Pindar's own phrase, * a black <lb/>
            heart forged when the flame was cold ?' ” "I pass over <lb/>
            then," said I, " the similar proclamation at Sparta, ' After <lb/>
            the Lesbian singer,' in honour and memory of old Terpan­ <lb/>
            der, for it is a similar case. But you yourselves certainly <lb/>
            lay claim to be better than other Bœotians as descended <lb/>
            from Opheltes,2 and than other Phocians because of your <lb/>
            ancestor Daiphantus,3 and you were the first to give me <lb/>
            help and assistance in preserving for the Lycormæ and <lb/>
            Satilæi their hereditary privilege of wearing crowns as <lb/>
            descendants of Hercules, when I contended that we ought <lb/>
            to confirm the honours and favours of the descendants of <lb/>
            Hercules more especially because, though he was such a <lb/>
            benefactor to the Greeks, he had had himself no adequate <lb/>
            favour or return." “You remind me," be said, "of a <lb/>
            noble effort, and one well worthy of a philosopher." <lb/>
            " Dismiss then," said I, "my dear fellow, your vehement <lb/>
            accusation against the gods, and do not be so vexed that <lb/>

            from a good stock. For it is unreasonable, if wo continue <lb/>
            to show favour to a virtuous stock, to think punishment <lb/>
            wrong in the case of a criminal stock, or that it should not <lb/>
            correspond with the adequate reward of merit. And he <lb/>
            that is glad to see the descendants of Cimon honoured at <lb/>
            Athens, but is displeased and indignant that the descen­ <lb/>
            dants of Lachares or Aristo are in exile, is too soft and <lb/>
            easy, or rather too fault-finding and peevish with the gods, <lb/>
            accusing them if the descendants of a bad and wicked man <lb/>
            are fortunate, and accusing them also if the progeny of the <lb/>
            bad are wiped off the face of the earth ; thus finding fault <lb/>
            with the deity alike, whether the descendants of the good <lb/>
            or bad father are unfortunate."</p>
          <p>§ XIV. “ Let these remarks," I continued, " be your bul­ <lb/>
            warks as it were against those excessively bitter and <lb/>
            railing accusations. And taking up again as it were the <lb/>
            initial clue to our subject, which as it is about the deity is <lb/>
            dark and full of mazes and labyrinths, let us warily and <lb/>
            calmly follow the track to what is probable and plausible, <lb/>
            for certainty and truth are things very difficult to find even <lb/>
            in every-day life. For example, why are the children of <lb/>
            those that have died of consumption or dropsy bidden to <lb/>
            sit with their feet in water till the dead body is burnt ? <lb/>
            For that is thought to prevent the disease transferring <lb/>
            itself to them. Again, when a she-goat takes a bit of <lb/>
            eringo into her mouth, why do the whole herd stand still, <lb/>
            till the goatherd comes up and takes it out of her mouth ? <lb/>
            There are other properties that have connection and corn­ <lb/>
            munication, and that transfer themselves from one thing <lb/>
            to another with incredible1 quickness and over immense <lb/>
            distances. But we marvel more at intervals of time than <lb/>
            place. And yet is it more wonderful that Athens should <lb/>
            have been smitten with a plague2 that started in Arabia, <lb/>
            and of which Pericles died and Thucydides fell sick, than <lb/>
            that, when the Delphians and Sybarites became wicked, <lb/>
            vengeance should have fallen on their descendants.8 For <lb/>
            properties have relations and connections between ends and <note type="footnote"> 1 Reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπίστοις</foreign> with Xylander. </note><note type="footnote"> a The famous plague.

            beginnings, and although the reason of them may not be <lb/>
            known by us, they silently perform their errand."</p>
          <p>§ xv. " Moreover the public punishments of cities by the <lb/>
            gods admits of a just defence. For a city is one continuous <lb/>
            entity, a sort of creature that never changes from age, or be­ <lb/>
            comes different by time, but is ever sympathetic with and <lb/>
            conformable to itself, and is answerable for whatever it does <lb/>
            or has done for the public weal, as long as the community <lb/>
            by its union and federal bonds preserves its unity. For he <lb/>
            that would make several, or rather any quantity of, cities <lb/>
            out of one by process of time would be like a person who <lb/>
            made one human being several, by regarding him now as <lb/>
            an old man, now as a young man, now as a stripling. Or <lb/>
            rather this kind of reasoning resembles the arguments of <lb/>
            Epicharmus, from whom the sophists borrowed the piled­ <lb/>
            up method of reasoning,1 for example, he incurred the debt <lb/>
            long ago, so he does not owe it now, being a different <lb/>
            person, or, be was invited to dinner yesterday, but he comes <lb/>
            uninvited to-day, for he is another person. And yet age <lb/>
            produces greater changes in any individual than it does <lb/>
            commonly in cities. For any one would recognize Athens <lb/>
            again if he had not seen it for thirty years, for the present <lb/>
            habits and feelings of the people there, their business, <lb/>
            amusements, likes and dislikes, are just what they were <lb/>
            long ago; whereas a man's friend or acquaintance meeting <lb/>
            him after some time would hardly recognize his appear­ <lb/>
            ance, for the change of character easily introduced by <lb/>
            every thought and deed, feeling and custom, produce a <lb/>
            wonderful strangeness and novelty in the same person. <lb/>
            And yet a man is reckoned to be the same person from <lb/>
            birth to death, and similarly we think it right for a city <lb/>
            always remaining the same to be liable to reproach for the <lb/>
            ill deeds of its former inhabitants, on the same principle as <lb/>
            it enjoys its ancient glory and power ; or shall we, without <lb/>
            being aware of it, throw everything into Heraclitus' river, <lb/>
            into which he says a person cannot step twice,2 since nature <lb/>
            is ever changing and altering everything ? " <note type="footnote"> 1 " Videtur idem cum sorita esse.”—Reiske, </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Compare our author, "De EI apud Delphos,” § xviii. See also <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>§ XVI. “ If then a city is one continuous entity, so of course <lb/>
            is a race that starts from one beginning, that can trace <lb/>
            back intimate union and similarity of faculties, for that <lb/>
            which is begot is not, like some production of art, unlike <lb/>
            the begetter, for it proceeds from him, and is not merely <lb/>
            produced by him, so that it appropriately receives his share, <lb/>
            whether that be honour or punishment. And if I should <lb/>
            not seem to be trifling, I should say that the bronze statue <lb/>
            of Cassander melted down by the Athenians, and the body <lb/>
            of Dionysius thrown out of their territory by the Syra­ <lb/>
            cusans after his death, were treated more unjustly than <lb/>
            punishing their posterity would have been. For there was <lb/>
            none of the nature of Cassander in the statue, and the soul <lb/>
            of Dionysius had left his dead body before this outrage, <lb/>
            whereas Nysæus and Apollocrates,1 Antipater and Philip,2 <lb/>
            and similarly other sons of wicked parents had innate in <lb/>
            them a good deal of their fathers, and that no listless or <lb/>
            inactive element, but one by which they lived and were <lb/>
            nourished, and by which their ideas were controlled. Nor <lb/>
            is it at all strange or absurd that some should have their <lb/>
            fathers' characteristics. And to speak generally, as in <lb/>
            surgery whatever is useful is also just, and that person <lb/>
            would be ridiculous who should say it was unjust to <lb/>
            cauterize the thumb when the hip-joints were in pain, <lb/>
            and to lance the stomach when the liver was inflamed, or <lb/>
            when oxen were tender in their hoofs to anoint the tips of <lb/>
            their horns, so he that looks for any other justice in punish­ <lb/>
            ment than curing vice, and is dissatisfied if surgery is em. <lb/>
            ployed to one part to benefit another, as surgeons open a, <lb/>
            vein to relieve ophthalmia, can see nothing beyond the evi­ <lb/>
            dence of the senses, and does not remember that even a <lb/>
            schoolmaster by correcting one lad admonishes others, and <lb/>
            that by decimation a general makes his whole army obey. <lb/>
            And so not only by one part to another comes benefit, but <lb/>
            also to the soul through the soul, even more often than to the <lb/>
            body through the body, come certain dispositions, and vices <lb/>
            or improvement of character. For just as it is likely in the <lb/>
            case of the body that the same feelings and changes will take <lb/>
            place, so the soul, being worked upon by fancies, naturally <note type="footnote"> 1 Sons of Dionysius.</note> <note type="footnote">2 Sons of Cassander. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="352"/>
            becomes better or worse according as it has more confidence <lb/>
            or fear."</p>
          <p>§ XVII. While I was thus speaking, Olympicus interposed, <lb/>
            and said, " You seem in your argument to assume the im­ <lb/>
            portant assumption of the permanence of the soul." I <lb/>
            replied, " Yon too concede it, or rather did concede it. For <lb/>
            that the deity deals with everyone according to his merit <lb/>
            has been the assumption of our argument from the begin­ <lb/>
            ning." Then said he, " Do you think that it follows, <lb/>
            because the gods notice our actions and deal with us <lb/>
            accordingly, that souls are either altogether imperishable, <lb/>
            or for some time survive dissolution ?" Then said I, <lb/>
            " Not exactly so, my good sir, but is the deity so little <lb/>
            and so attached to trifles, if we have nothing divine in our­ <lb/>
            selves, nothing resembling him, nothing lasting or sure, <lb/>
            but that we all do fade as a leaf, as Homer 1 says, and die <lb/>
            after a brief life, as to take the trouble--like women that <lb/>
            tend and cultivate their gardens of Adonis 2 in pots-to <lb/>
            create souls to flourish in a delicate body having no stability <lb/>
            only for a day, and then to be annihilated at once3 by any <lb/>
            occasion ? And if you please, leaving the other gods out <lb/>
            of the question, consider the case of our god here.4 Does <lb/>
            it seem likely to you that, if he knew that the souls of the <lb/>
            dead perish immediately, and glide out of their bodies like <lb/>
            mist or smoke, he would enjoin many propitiatory offer­ <lb/>
            ings for the departed and honours for the dead, merely <lb/>
            cheating and beguiling those that believed in him ? For <lb/>
            my own part, I shall never abandon my belief in the per­ <lb/>
            manence of the soul, unless some second Hercules IS shall <lb/>
            come and take away the tripod of the Pythian Priestess, <lb/>
            and abolish and destroy the oracle. For as long as many <lb/>
            such oracles are still given, as was said to be given to <lb/>
            Corax of Naxos formerly, it is impious to declare that the <lb/>
            soul dies." Then said Patrocleas, " What oracle do you <lb/>
            refer too ? Who was this Corax ? To me both the occur­ <lb/>
            rence and name are quite strange." " That cannot be," said <note type="footnote"> 1 “Iliad” vi. 146-149. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Compare Plato, " Phædrus,” 276 B. These gardens of Adonis were <lb/>

            I, " but I am to blame for using the surname instead of the <lb/>
            name. For he that killed Archilochus in battle was called <lb/>
            Calondes, it seems, but his surname was Corax. He was <lb/>
            first rejected by the Pythian Priestess, as having slain a <lb/>
            man sacred to the Muses, but after using many entreaties <lb/>
            and prayers, and urging pleas in defence of his act, he was <lb/>
            ordered to go to the dwelling of Tettix, and appease the <lb/>

            founded a city, and dwelt near the place where departed <lb/>
            souls were conjured up. Similarly also, when the Spartans <lb/>

            the necromancers were summoned from Italy, and, after <lb/>

          <p>§ XVIII. "It is one and the same argument," I continued, <lb/>
            “ that confirms the providence of the deity and the perma­ <lb/>
            nence of the soul of man, so that you cannot leave one if <lb/>
            you take away the other. And if the soul survives after <lb/>
            death, it makes the probability stronger that rewards or <lb/>
            punishments will be assigned to it. For during life the soul <lb/>
            struggles, like an athlete, and when the struggle is over, <lb/>
            then it gets its deserts. But what rewards or punishments <lb/>
            the soul gets when by itself in the unseen world for the deeds <lb/>
            done in the body has nothing to do with us that are alive, <lb/>
            and is perhaps not credited by us, and certainly unknown <lb/>
            to us; whereas those punishments that come on descen­ <lb/>
            dants and on the race are evident to all that are alive, and <lb/>
            deter and keep back many from wickedness. For there is no <lb/>
            more disgraceful or bitter punishment than to see our chil­ <lb/>
            dren in misfortune through our faults, and if the soul of <lb/>
            an impious or lawless man could see after death, not his <lb/>
            statues or honours taken from him, but his children or <lb/>
            friends or race in great adversity owing to him, and pay­ <lb/>
            ing the penalty for his misdeeds, no one would ever persuade <lb/>
            him, could he come to life again, to be unjust and licen­ <lb/>
            tious, even for the honours of Zeus. I could tell you a story <lb/>
            on this head, which I recently heard, but I hesitate to do <lb/>
            so, lest you should regard it only as a myth; I confine my­ <lb/>
            self therefore to probability." “ Pray don't," said Olym­ <lb/>
            picas, "let us have your story." And as the others made <note type="footnote"> AA, </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="354"/>
            the same request, I said, " Permit me first to finish my <lb/>
            discourse according to probability, and then, if you like, I <lb/>
            will set my myth a going, if it is a myth.</p>
          <p>§ xix. Bion says the deity in punishing the children of <lb/>
            the wicked for their fathers' crimes is more ridiculous than <lb/>
            a doctor administering a potion to a son or grandson for a <lb/>
            fathers or grandfather's disease. But the cases, though in <lb/>
            some respects similar and like, are in others dissimilar. <lb/>
            For to cure one person of a disease does not cure another, <lb/>
            nor is one any better, when suffering from ophthalmia or <lb/>
            fever, by seeing another anointed or poulticed. But the <lb/>
            punishments of evil-doors are exhibited to everybody for <lb/>
            this reason, that it is the function of justice, when it is <lb/>
            carried out as reason dictates, to check some by the punish­ <lb/>
            ment of others. So that Dion did -not see in what respect <lb/>
            his comparison touched our subject. For sometimes, when a <lb/>
            man falls into a grievous but not incurable malady, which <lb/>
            afterwards by intemperance and negligence ruins his consti­ <lb/>
            tution and kills him, is not his son, who is not supposed to be <lb/>
            suffering from the same malady but only to have a predis­ <lb/>
            position for it, enjoined to a careful manner of living by his <lb/>
            medical man, or friend, or intelligent trainer in gymnastics, <lb/>
            or honest guardian, and recommended to abstain from fish <lb/>
            and pastry, wine and women, and to take medicine fre­ <lb/>
            quently, and to go in for training in the gymnasiums, and so <lb/>
            to dissipate and get rid of the small seeds of what might <lb/>
            be a serious malady, if he allowed it to come to a head ? Do <lb/>
            we not indeed give advice of this kind to the children of <lb/>
            diseased fathers or mothers, bidding them take care and be <lb/>
            cautious and not to neglect themselves, but at once to arrest <lb/>
            the first germ of the malady, nipping it in the bud while <lb/>
            removable, and before it has got a firm footing in the con­ <lb/>
            stitution ? ” “ Certainly we do," said all the company. <lb/>
            " We are not then," I continued, " acting in a strange or <lb/>
            ridiculous but in a necessary and useful way, in arranging <lb/>
            their exercise and food and physic for the sons of epileptic or <lb/>
            atrabilious or gouty people, not when they are ill, but to pre­ <lb/>
            vent their becoming so. For the offspring of a poor consti­ <lb/>
            tution does not require punishment, but it does require <lb/>
            medical treatment and care, and if any one stigmatizes this, <lb/>
            because it curtails pleasure and involves some self-denial <lb/>
             <pb n="355"/>
            and pain, as a punishment inflicted by cowardice and <lb/>
            timidity, we care not for his opinion. Can it be right to tend <lb/>
            and care for the body that has an hereditary predisposition <lb/>
            to some malady, and are we to neglect the growth and <lb/>
            spread in the young character of hereditary taint of vice, <lb/>
            and to dally with it, and wait till it be plainly mixed up <lb/>
            with the feelings, and, to use the language of Pindar, <lb/>
            “ produce malignant fruit in the heart ? "</p>
          <p>§ xx. Or is the deity in this respect no wiser than <lb/>
            Hesiod, who exhorts and advises, " not to beget children <lb/>
            on our return from a sad funeral, but after a banquet with <lb/>
            the gods," 1 as though not vice or virtue only, but sorrow <lb/>
            or joy and all other propensities, came from generation, to <lb/>
            which the poet bids us come gay and agreeable and sprightly. <lb/>
            But it is not Hesiod's function, or the work of human <lb/>
            wisdom, but it belongs to the deity, to discern and accurately <lb/>
            distinguish similarities and differences of character, before <lb/>
            they become obvious by resulting in crime through the <lb/>
            influence of the passions. For the young of bears and <lb/>
            wolves and apes manifest from their birth the nature <lb/>
            innate in them in all its naked simplicity; whereas man­ <lb/>
            kind, under the influence of customs and opinions and laws, <lb/>
            frequently conceal their bad qualities and imitate what is <lb/>
            good, so as altogether to obliterate and escape from the <lb/>
            innate taint of vice, or to be undetected for a long time, <lb/>
            throwing the veil of craft round their real nature, so that <lb/>
            we are scarce conscious of their villainy till we feel the <lb/>
            blow or smart of some unjust action, so that we are in fact <lb/>
            only aware that there is such a thing as injustice when men <lb/>
            act unjustly, or as vice when men act viciously, or as <lb/>
            cowardice when men run away, just as if one were to sup­ <lb/>
            pose that scorpions had a sting only when they stung us, <lb/>
            or that vipers were venomous only when they bit us, which <lb/>
            would be a very silly idea. For every bad man is not bad <lb/>
            only when he breaks out into crime, but he has the seeds of <lb/>
            vice in his nature, and is only vicious in act when he has <lb/>
            opportunity and means, as opportunity makes the thief <lb/>
            steal,2 and the tyrant violate the laws. But the deity is <note type="footnote"> 1 Hesiod,“ Works and Days," 735, 736. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Compare the French Proverb, "L'occasion fait le larron." And <lb/>
            Juvenal's ‘ Nemo repente fuit turpissimus." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="356"/>
            not ignorant of the nature and disposition of every man, <lb/>
            inasmuch as by his very nature he can read the soul better <lb/>
            than the body, and does not wait to punish violence in the <lb/>
            act, or shamelessness in the tongue, or lasciviousness in the <lb/>
            members. For he does not retaliate upon the wrong-doer <lb/>
            as having been ill-treated by him, nor is he angry with the <lb/>
            robber as having been plundered by him, nor does he hate <lb/>
            the adulterer as having himself suffered from his licentious­ <lb/>
            ness, but it is to cure him that be often punishes the adul­ <lb/>
            terous or avaricious or unjust man in embryo, before he has <lb/>
            had time to work out all his villainy, as we try to stop <lb/>
            epileptic fits before they come on.</p>
          <p>§ xxi. Just now we were dissatisfied that the wicked <lb/>
            were punished late and tardily, whereas at present we <lb/>
            find fault with the deity for correcting the character and <lb/>
            disposition of some before they commit crime, from our <lb/>
            ignoring that the future deed may be worse and more <lb/>
            dreadful than the past, and the hidden intention than the <lb/>
            overt act; for we are not able fully to understand the <lb/>
            reasons why it is better to leave some alone in their ill deeds, <lb/>
            and to arrest others in the intention ; just as no doubt <lb/>
            medicine is not appropriate in the case of some patients, <lb/>
            which would be beneficial to others not ill, but yet perhaps <lb/>
            in a more dangerous condition still. And so the gods do <lb/>
            not visit all the offences of parents on their children, but if <lb/>
            a good man is the son of a bad one, as the son of a sickly <lb/>
            parent is sometimes of a good constitution, he is exempt <lb/>
            from the punishment of his race, as not being a partici­ <lb/>
            pator in its viciousness. But if a young man imitates his <lb/>
            vicious race it is only right that he should inherit the <lb/>
            punishment of their ill deeds, as he would their debts. For <lb/>
            Antigonus was not punished for Demetrius, nor, of the old <lb/>
            heroes,1 Phyleus for Augeas, or Nestor for Neleus, for <lb/>
            though their sires were bad they were good, but those <lb/>
            whose nature liked and approved the vices of their ances­ <lb/>
            tors, these justice punished, taking vengeance on their simi­ <lb/>
            larity in viciousness. For as the warts and moles and <lb/>
            freckles of parents often skip a generation, and reappear in <lb/>
            the grandsons and granddaughters, and as a Greek woman, <note type="footnote"> 1 So Reiske very ingeniously. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="357"/>
            that had a black baby and so was accused of adultery, <lb/>
            found out that she was the great granddaughter of an <lb/>
            Ethiopian,1 and as the son of Pytho the Nisibian who <lb/>
            recently died, and who was said to trace his descent to the <lb/>
            Sparti, had the birthmark on his body of the print of a <lb/>
            spear the token of his race, which though long dormant <lb/>
            had come up again as out of the deep, so frequently earlier <lb/>
            generations conceal and suppress the mental idiosyncrasies <lb/>
            and passions of their race, which afterwards nature causes <lb/>
            to break out in other members of the family, and so dis­ <lb/>
            plays the family bent either to vice or virtue."</p>
          <p>§ XXII. When I had said thus much I was silent, but <lb/>
            Olympicus smiled and said, " We do not praise you, lest <lb/>
            we should seem to forget your promised story, as though <lb/>
            what you had advanced was adequate proof enough, but <lb/>
            we will give our opinion when we have heard it." Then I <lb/>
            began as follows. " Thespesius of Soli, an intimate friend <lb/>
            of that Protogenes3 who lived in this city with us for some <lb/>
            time, had been very profligate during the early part of <lb/>
            his life, and had quickly run through his property, and for <lb/>
            some time owing to his straits had given himself up to bad <lb/>
            practices, when repenting of his old ways, and following the <lb/>
            pursuit of riches, he resembled those profligate husbands <lb/>
            that pay no attention to their wives while they live with <lb/>
            them, but get rid of them, and then, after they have married <lb/>
            other men, do all they can wickedly to seduce them. Ab­ <lb/>
            staining then from nothing dishonourable that could bring <lb/>
            either enjoyment or gain, in no long time he got together <lb/>
            no great amount of property, but a very great reputation <lb/>
            for villainy. But what most damaged his character was <lb/>
            the answer he received from the oracle of Amphilochus.4 <lb/>
            For he sent it seems a messenger to consult the god whether <lb/>
            he would live the rest of his life better, and the answer was <lb/>
            be would do better after his death. And indeed this hap­ <lb/>
            pened in a sense not long after. For he fell headlong down <lb/>
            from a great height, and though he bad received no wound <note type="footnote"> 1 A rather far-fetched pedigree. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 See Pausanias, viii. 11 ; ix. 5, 10. See also Ovid, “Metamor­ <lb/>

             <pb n="358"/>
            nor even a blow, the fall did for him, but three days after <lb/>
            (just, as he was about to be buried) he recovered. He. soon <lb/>
            picked up his strength again, and went home, and so <lb/>
            changed his manner of life that people would hardly credit <lb/>
            it. For the Cilicians say that they know nobody who was <lb/>
            in those days more fairdealing in business, or more devout <lb/>
            to the deity, or more disagreeable to his enemies, or more <lb/>
            faithful to his friends; insomuch that all who had any <lb/>
            dealings with him desired to hear the reason of this change, <lb/>
            not thinking that so great a reformation of character could <lb/>
            have proceeded from chance, and their idea was correct, as <lb/>
            his narrative to Protogenes and others of his great friends <lb/>
            showed. For he told them that, when his soul left the <lb/>
            body, the change he first underwent was as if he were a <lb/>
            pilot thrown violently into the sea out of a ship. Then <lb/>
            raising himself up a little, he thought he recovered the <lb/>
            power of breathing again altogether, and looked round him <lb/>
            in every direction, as if one eye of the soul was open. But <lb/>
            he saw none of the things he had ever seen before, but stars <lb/>
            enormous in size and at immense distance from one another, <lb/>
            sending forth a wonderful and intense brightness of colour, <lb/>
            so that the soul was borne along and moved about every­ <lb/>
            where quickly and easily, like a ship in fair weather. But <lb/>
            omitting most of the sights he saw, he said that the souls of <lb/>
            the dead mounted into the air, which yielded to them and <lb/>
            formed fiery bubbles, and then, when each bubble quietly <lb/>
            broke, they assumed human forms, light in weight but with <lb/>
            different kinds of motion, for some leapt about with wonder­ <lb/>
            ful ability and darted straight upwards, while others like <lb/>
            spindles flitted round all together in a circle, some in an <lb/>
            upward direction, some in a downward, with mixed and <lb/>
            confused motion, hardly stopping at all, or only after a <lb/>
            very long time. As to most of these he was ignorant who <lb/>
            they were, but he saw two or three that he knew, and tried to <lb/>
            approach them and talk with them, but they would not <lb/>
            listen to him, and did not seem to be in their right minds, <lb/>
            but out of their senses and distraught, avoiding every sight <lb/>
            and touch, and at first turned round and round alone, but <lb/>
            afterwards meeting many other souls whirling round ard <lb/>
            in the same condition as themselves, they moved about pro­ <lb/>
            miscuously with no particular object in view, and uttered <lb/>
             <pb n="359"/>
            inarticulate sounds, like yells, mixed with wailing and <lb/>
            terror. Other souls in the upper part of the air seemed <lb/>
            joyful, and frequently approached one another in a friendly <lb/>
            way, and avoided those troubled souls, and seemed to mark <lb/>
            their displeasure by keeping themselves to themselves, and <lb/>
            their joy and delight by extension and expansion. At last <lb/>
            he said he saw the soul of a relation, that he thought he <lb/>
            knew but was not quite sure, as he died when he was a <lb/>
            boy, which came up to him and said to him, " Welcome, <lb/>
            Thespesius." And he wondering, and saying that his name <lb/>
            was not Thespesius but Aridæus, the soul replied, " That <lb/>
            was your old name, but henceforth it will be Thespesius. <lb/>
            For assuredly you are not dead, but by the will of the gods <lb/>
            are come here with your intellect, for the rest of your soul <lb/>
            you have left in the body like an anchor ; and as a proof of <lb/>
            what I say both now and hereafter notice that the souls of <lb/>
            the dead have no shadow and do not move their eyelids." <lb/>
            Thespesius, on hearing these words, pulled himself some­ <lb/>
            what more together again, and began to use his reason, <lb/>
            and looking more closely he noticed that an indistinct and <lb/>
            shadow-like line was suspended over him, while the others <lb/>
            shone all round and were transparent, but were not all <lb/>
            alike; for some were like the full-moon at its brightest, <lb/>
            throwing out one smooth even and continuous colour, <lb/>
            others had spots or light marks here and there, while <lb/>
            others were quite variegated and strange to the sight, with <lb/>
            black spots like snakes, while others again had dim scratches.</p>
          <p>Then the kinsman of Thespesius (for there is nothing to <lb/>
            prevent our calling the souls by the name of the persons), <lb/>
            pointed out everything, and told him that Adrastea, the <lb/>
            daughter of Necessity and Zeus, was placed in the highest <lb/>
            position to punish all crimes, and no criminal was either <lb/>
            so great or so small as to be able to escape her either by <lb/>
            fraud or violence. But, as there were three kinds of <lb/>
            punishment, each had its own officer and administering <lb/>
            functionary. " For speedy Vengeance undertakes the punish­ <lb/>
            ment of those that are to be corrected at once in the body <lb/>
            and through their bodies, and she mildly passes by many <lb/>
            offences that only need expiation; but if the cure of vice <lb/>
            demands further pains, then the deity hands over such <lb/>
            criminals after death to Justice, and those whom Justice <lb/>
             <pb n="360"/>
            rejects as altogether incurable, Erinnys (the third and <lb/>
            fiercest of Adrastea's officers), pursues as they are fleeing <lb/>
            and wandering about in various directions, and with pitiless <lb/>
            severity utterly undoes them all, and thrusts them down <lb/>
            to a place not to be seen or spoken about. And, of all <lb/>
            these punishments, that which is administered in this life <lb/>
            by Vengeance is most like those in use among the barbarians. <lb/>
            For as among the Persians they pluck off and scourge the <lb/>
            garments and tiaras of those that are to be punished, while <lb/>
            the offenders weep and beg them to cease, so most punish­ <lb/>
            ments by fine or bodily chastisement have no sharp touch, <lb/>
            nor do they reach vice itself, but are only for show and <lb/>
            sentiment. And whoever goes from this world to that <lb/>
            incorrigible and impure, Justice takes him aside, naked as <lb/>
            he is in soul, and unable to veil or hide or conceal his <lb/>
            villainy, but descried all round and in all points by every­ <lb/>
            body, and shows him first to his good parents, if such they <lb/>
            were, to let them see what a wretch he is and how unworthy <lb/>
            of his ancestors ; but if they were wicked too, seeing them <lb/>
            punished and himself being seen by them, he is chastised <lb/>
            for a long time till he is purged of each of his bad propen­ <lb/>
            sities by sufferings and pains, which as much exceed in <lb/>
            magnitude and intensity all sufferings in the flesh, as what <lb/>
            is real is more vivid than a dream. But the scars and marks <lb/>
            of the stripes for each bad propensity are more visible in <lb/>
            some than in others. Observe also, he continued, the dif­ <lb/>
            ferent and various colours of the souls. That dark dirty­ <lb/>
            brown colour is the pigment of illiberality and covetous­ <lb/>
            ness, and the blood-red the sign of cruelty and savageness, <lb/>
            and where the blue is there sensuality and love of pleasure <lb/>
            are not easily eradicated, and that violet and livid colour <lb/>
            marks malice and envy, like the dark liquid ejected by the <lb/>
            cuttle fish. For as during life vice produces these colours <lb/>
            by the soul being acted upon by passions and reacting upon <lb/>
            the body, so here it is the end of purification and correc­ <lb/>
            tion when they are toned down, and the soul becomes alto­ <lb/>
            gether bright and one colour. But as long as these colours <lb/>
            remain, there are relapses of the passions accompanied by <lb/>
            palpitation and throbbing of the heart, in some faint and <lb/>
            soon suppressed, in others more violent and lasting. And <lb/>
            some of these souls by being again and again corrected <lb/>
             <pb n="361"/>
            recover their proper disposition and condition, while others <lb/>
            again by their violent ignorance and excessive love of plea­ <lb/>
            sure 1 are carried into the bodies of animals; for one by <lb/>
            weakness of reasoning power, and slowness of contempla­ <lb/>
            tion, is impelled by the practical element in him to gene­ <lb/>
            ration, while another, lacking an instrument to satisfy his <lb/>
            licentiousness, desires to gratify his passions immediately, <lb/>
            and to get that gratification through the medium of the <lb/>
            body; for here there is no real fruition, but only an imper­ <lb/>
            fect shadow and dream of incomplete pleasure."</p>
          <p>After he had said this, Thespesius' kinsman hurried him <lb/>
            at great speed through immense space, as it seemed to him, <lb/>
            though be travelled as easily and straight as if he were <lb/>
            carried on the wings of the sun's rays. At last he got to <lb/>
            an extensive and bottomless abyss, where his strength left <lb/>
            him, as he found was the case with the other souls there: <lb/>
            for keeping together and making swoops, like birds, they <lb/>
            flitted all round the abyss, but did not venture to pass over <lb/>
            it. To internal view it resembled the caverns of Bacchus, <lb/>
            being beautiful throughout2 with trees and green foliage <lb/>
            and flowers of all kinds, and it breathed a soft and gentle air, <lb/>
            laden with scents marvellously pleasant, and producing the <lb/>
            effect that wine does on those who are topers ; for the souls <lb/>
            were elevated by its fragrance, and gay and blithe with <lb/>
            one another: and the whole spot was full of mirth and <lb/>
            laughter, and such songs as emanate from gaiety and <lb/>
            enjoyment. And Thespesius' kinsman told him that this <lb/>
            was the way Dionysus went up to heaven by, and by which <lb/>
            he afterwards took up Semele, and it was called the place of <lb/>
            Oblivion. But he would not let Thespesius stay there, <lb/>
            much as he wished, but forcibly dragged him away, <lb/>
            instructing and telling him that the intellect was melted and <lb/>
            moistened by pleasure, and that the irrational and corporeal <lb/>
            element being watered and made flesh stirs up the memory <lb/>
            of the body, from which comes a yearning and strong de­ <lb/>
            sire for generation, so called from being an inclination to <lb/>
            the earthy when the soul is weighed down with moisture. <note type="footnote"> 1 Reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">φιληδονίας ἰσϰὺς</foreign> with Reiske. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">διαπεποικιλμένον</foreign> ov with Wyttenbach. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 A paronomasia on <foreign xml:lang="grc">γένεσις</foreign> as if <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπὶ γὴν νευ̃σις</foreign>.

            </p>
          <p>Next Thespesius travelled as far in another direction, <lb/>
            and seemed to see a great crater into which several rivers <lb/>
            emptied themselves, one whiter than the foam of the sea <lb/>
            or snow, another like the purple of the rainbow, and others <lb/>
            of various hues whose brightness was apparent at some <lb/>
            distance, but when he got nearer the air became thinner <lb/>
            and the colours grew dim, and the crater lost all its gay <lb/>
            colours but white. And he saw three genii sitting together <lb/>
            in a triangular position, mixing the rivers together in certain <lb/>
            proportions. Then the guide of Thespesius' soul told him, <lb/>
            that Orpheus got as far as here, when he came in quest of <lb/>
            the soul of his wife,1 and from not exactly remembering what <lb/>
            he had seen spread a false report among mankind, that the <lb/>
            oracle at Delphi was common to A polio and Night, though <lb/>
            Apollo had no communion with Night: but this, pursued the <lb/>
            guide, is an oracle common to Night and the Moon, that <lb/>
            utters forth its oracular knowledge in no particular part of <lb/>
            the world, nor has it any particular seat, but wanders about <lb/>
            everywhere in men's dreams and visions. Hence, as you see, <lb/>
            dreams receive and disseminate a mixture2 of simple truth <lb/>
            with deceit and error. But the oracle of Apollo you do not <lb/>
            know, nor can you see it, for the earthiness of the soul does <lb/>
            not suffer it to soar upwards, but keeps it down in depen­ <lb/>
            dence on the body. And taking him nea rer his guide tried to <lb/>
            show him the light from the tripod, which, as he said, shone <lb/>
            as far as Parnassus through the bosom of Themis, but <lb/>
            though he desired to see it he could not for its brightness, <lb/>
            but as he passed by he heard the shrill voice of a woman <lb/>
            speaking in verse several things, among others, bethought, <lb/>
            telling the time of his death. That, said the genius, was <lb/>
            the voice of the Sibyl, who sang about the future as she was <lb/>
            being borne about in the Orb of the moon. Though desirous <lb/>
            then to hear more, he was conveyed into another direction <lb/>
            by the violent motion of the moon, as if he had been in the <lb/>
            eddies of a whirlpool, so that he heard very little more, <lb/>
            only a prophecy about Mt. Vesuvius and that <unclear>Dicæirchia3</unclear> <lb/>
            would be destroyed by fire, and a short piece about the <note type="footnote"> 1 Eurydice. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 it<foreign xml:lang="grc">μιγιύμενον</foreign>, Turn. et Bong.," Reiske. Surely the right reading. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Latin Puteoli. </note> <lb/>

            Emperor then reigning that though he was good he <lb/>
            would lose his empire through sickness."</p>
          <p>After this Thespesius and his guide turned to see those <lb/>
            that were undergoing punishment. And at first they saw <lb/>
            only distressing and pitiable sights, but after that, Thespe­ <lb/>
            sius, little expecting it, found himself among his friends <lb/>
            and acquaintances and kinsfolk who were being punished, <lb/>
            and undergoing dreadful sufferings and hideous and bitter <lb/>
            tortures, and who wept and wailed to him. And at last <lb/>
            he descried his father coming up out of a certain gulf <lb/>
            covered with marks and scars, stretching out his hands, <lb/>
            and not allowed to keep silence, but compelled by those <lb/>
            that presided over his torture to confess that he had been <lb/>
            an accursed wretch and poisoned some strangers that had <lb/>
            gold, and during his lifetime had escaped the detection of <lb/>
            everybody; but had been found out here, and his guilt <lb/>
            brought home to him, for which he had already suffered <lb/>
            much, and was being dragged on to suffer more. So <lb/>
            great was his consternation and fear that he did not dare <lb/>
            to intercede or beg for his father's release, but wishing to <lb/>
            turn and flee he could no longer see his gentle and kind <lb/>
            guide, but he was thrust forward by some persons horrible <lb/>
            to look at, as if some dire necessity compelled him to go <lb/>
            through with the business, and saw that the shades of <lb/>
            those that had been notorious criminals and punished in <lb/>
            their life-time were not so severely tortured here or like <lb/>
            the others, but had an incomplete2 though toilsome punish­ <lb/>
            ment for their irrational passions.3 Whereas those who <lb/>
            under the mask and show of virtue had lived all their lives <lb/>
            in undetected vice were forced by their torturers with <lb/>
            labour and pain to turn their souls inside out, unnaturally <lb/>
            wriggling and writhing about, like the sea-scolopendras <lb/>
            who, when they have swallowed the hook, turn themselves <lb/>
            inside out; but some of them their torturers flayed and <lb/>
            crimped so as to show their various inward vices which <lb/>
            were only skinned over, which were deep in their soul the <note type="footnote"> 1 Vespasian. See Suetonius, " Vespasian," ch. 24, as to the particu­ <lb/>

            principal part of man. And he said he saw other souls, <lb/>
            like snakes two or three or even more twined together, <lb/>
            devouring one another in malignity and malevolence for <lb/>
            what they had suffered or done in life. He said also that <lb/>
            there were several lakes running parallel, one of boiling <lb/>
            gold, another most cold of lead, another hard of iron, and <lb/>
            several demons were standing by, like smiths, who lowered <lb/>
            down and drew up by turns with instruments the souls of <lb/>
            those whose criminality lay in insatiable cupidity. For <lb/>
            when they were red-hot and transparent through their <lb/>
            bath in the lake of gold, the demons thrust them into the <lb/>
            lake of lead and dipped them in that; and when they got <lb/>
            congealed in it and hard as hail, they dipped them into the <lb/>
            lake of iron, and there they became wonderfully black, and <lb/>
            broken and crushed by the hardness of the iron, and <lb/>
            changed their appearance, and after that they were dipped <lb/>
            again in the lake of gold, after suffering, he said, dreadful <lb/>
            agony in all these changes of torment. But he said those <lb/>
            souls suffered most piteously of all that, when they seemed <lb/>
            to have escaped justice, were arrested again, and these were <lb/>
            those whose crimes had been visited on their children or <lb/>
            descendants. For whenever one of these latter happened <lb/>
            to come up, he fell into a rage and cried out, and showed <lb/>
            the marks of what he had suffered, and upbraided and pur­ <lb/>
            sued the soul of the parent, that wished to fly and hide <lb/>
            himself but could not. For quickly did the ministers of <lb/>
            torture pursue them, and hurry them back again to Jus. <lb/>
            tice,1 wailing all the while on account of their fore-know­ <lb/>
            ledge of what their punishment would be. And to some of <lb/>
            them he said many of their posterity clung at once, and <lb/>
            just like bees or bats stuck to them, and squeaked and gib­ <lb/>
            bered 2 in their rage at the memory of what they had suf­ <lb/>
            fered owing to them. Last of all he saw the souls of those <lb/>
            that were to come into the world a second time, forcibly <lb/>
            moulded and transformed into various kinds of animals by <lb/>
            artificers appointed for the very purpose with instruments <lb/>
            and blows, who broke off all the limbs of some, and only <lb/>
            wrenched off some of others, and polished others down or <note type="footnote"> 1 Adopting the arrangement of Wyttenbach. </note><note type="footnote">3 Compare Homer, “ Odyssey," xxiv. 5-10. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="365"/>
            annihilated them altogether, to fit them for other habits <lb/>
            and modes of life. Among them he saw the soul of Nero <lb/>
            tortured in other ways, and pierced with red-hot nails. <lb/>
            And the artificers having taken it in hand and converted <lb/>
            it into the semblance of a Pindaric viper, which gets its <lb/>
            way to life by gnawing through its mothers womb, a great <lb/>
            light, he said, suddenly shone, and a voice came out of the <lb/>
            light, ordering them to change it into something milder, <lb/>
            so they devised of it the animal that croaks about lakes <lb/>
            and marshes, for he had been punished sufficiently for his <lb/>
            crimes, and now deserved some favour at the hands of the <lb/>
            gods, for he had freed Greece, the noblest nation of his sub­ <lb/>
            jects and the best-beloved of the gods.1 So much did <lb/>
            Thespesius behold, but as he intended to return a horrible <lb/>
            dread came upon him. For a woman, marvellous in <lb/>
            appearance and size, took hold of him and said to him, <lb/>
            " Come here that you may the better remember everything <lb/>
            you have seen." And she was about to strike him with a <lb/>
            red-hot iron pin, such as the encaustic painters use,2 when <lb/>
            another woman prevented her ; and be was suddenly sucked <lb/>
            up, as through3 a pipe, by a strong and violent wind, and <lb/>
            lit upon his own body, and woke up and found that he was <lb/>
            close to his tomb.</p>

          <p>§ i. Plato in his Laws' does not permit neighbours to <lb/>
            use one another's water, unless they have first dug for <lb/>
            themselves as far as the clay, and reached ground that is <lb/>
            unsuitable for a well. For clay, having a rich and com­ <lb/>
            pact nature, absorbs the water it receives, and does not let <lb/>
            it pass through. But he allows people that cannot make <lb/>
            a well of their own to use their neighbour's water, for the <lb/>
            law ought to relieve necessity. Ought there not also to <note type="footnote"> I See PaUsanias, vii. 17, for a sneaking kindness for Nero. </note><note type="footnote"> * See Athenæus, 687 B.</note> <note type="footnote">3 Reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">διὰ</foreign> with Reiske. </note><note type="footnote">4 Page 844, A.

            be a law about money, that people should not borrow of <lb/>
            others, nor go to other people's sources of income, until they <lb/>
            have first examined their own resources at home, and col­ <lb/>
            lected, as by drops, what is necessary for their use ? But <lb/>
            nowadays from luxury and effeminacy and lavish expendi­ <lb/>
            ture people do not use their own resources, though they <lb/>
            have them, but borrow from others at great interest with­ <lb/>
            out necessity. And what proves this very clearly is the <lb/>
            fact that people do not lend money to the needy, but only <lb/>
            to those who, wanting an immediate supply, bring a wit­ <lb/>
            ness and adequate security for their credit, so that they can <lb/>
            be in no actual necessity of borrowing.1</p>
          <p>§ II. Why pay court to the banker or trader ? Borrow <lb/>
            from your own table. You have cups, silver dishes, pots <lb/>
            and pans. Use them in your need. Beautiful Aulis or <lb/>
            Tenedos will furnish you with earthenware instead, purer <lb/>
            than silver, for they will not smell strongly and unpleasantly <lb/>
            of interest, a kind of rust that daily soils your sumptuous­ <lb/>
            ness, nor will they remind you of the calends and the new <lb/>
            moon, which, though the most holy of days, the money- <lb/>
            lenders make ill-omened and hateful. For those who <lb/>
            instead of selling them put their goods out at pawn cannot <lb/>
            be saved even by Zeus the Protector of Property : they are <lb/>
            ashamed to sell, they are not ashamed to pay interest on <lb/>
            their goods when out at pawn. And yet the famous Peri­ <lb/>
            cles made the ornament of Athene, which weighed forty <lb/>
            talents of fine gold, removable at will, for “so,” he said, "we <lb/>
            can use the gold in war, and at some other time restore as <lb/>
            costly a one." So should we too in our necessities, as in a <lb/>
            siege, not receive a garrison imposed on us by a hostile <lb/>
            money-lender, nor allow our goods to go into slavery ; but <lb/>
            stripping our table, our bed, our carriages, and our diet, of <lb/>
            superfluities, we should keep ourselves free, intending to <lb/>
            restore all those things again, if we have good luck.</p>
          <p>§ III. So the Roman matrons offered their gold and orna. <lb/>
            ments as first-fruits to Pythian Apollo, out of which a <lb/>
            golden cup was made and sent to Delphi ;2 and the Car. <lb/>
            thaginian matrons had their heads shorn, and with the <note type="footnote"> 1 Reading with Wyttenbach <foreign xml:lang="grc">διδου̃σι</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔχουσι</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote">2 See Livy, v. 25. </note> <lb/>

            hair cut off made cords for the machines and engines to be <lb/>
            used in defence of their country.1 But we being ashamed <lb/>
            of independence enslave ourselves to covenants and con­ <lb/>
            ditions, when we ought to restrict and confine ourselves to <lb/>
            what is useful, and dock or sell useless superfluities, to <lb/>
            build a temple of liberty for ourselves, our wives, and <lb/>
            children. The famous Artemis at Ephesus gives asylum <lb/>
            and security from their creditors to debtors, when they take <lb/>
            refuge in her temple ; but the asylum and sanctuary of <lb/>
            frugality is everywhere open to the sober-minded, affording <lb/>
            them joyful and honourable and ample space for much ease. <lb/>
            For as the Pythian Priestess told the Athenians at the <lb/>
            time of the Median war that the god had given them wooden <lb/>
            walls,2 and they left the region and city, their goods and <lb/>
            houses, and took refuge in their ships for liberty, so the <lb/>
            god gives us a wooden table, and earthenware plate, and <lb/>
            coarse garments, if we wish to live free. Care not for fine <lb/>
            horses or chariots with handsome harness, adorned with <lb/>
            gold 3 and silver, which swift interest will catch up and out­ <lb/>
            run, but mounted on any chance donkey or nag flee from <lb/>
            the hostile and tyrannical money-lender, not demanding <lb/>
            like the Mede land and watery but interfering with your <lb/>
            liberty, and lowering your status. If you pay him not, he <lb/>
            duns you ; if you offer the money, he won't have it; if you <lb/>
            are selling anything, he cheapens the price; if you don't <lb/>
            want to sell, he forces you ; if you sue him, he comes to <lb/>
            terms with you; if you swear, he hectors ; if you go to <lb/>
            his house, he shuts the door in your face; whereas if you <lb/>
            stay at home, he billets himself on you, and is ever rapping <lb/>
            at your door.</p>
          <p>§ iv. How did Solon benefit the Athenians by ordaining <lb/>
            that debtors should no longer have to pay in person ? For <lb/>
            they are slaves to all money-lenders,5 and not to them only, <lb/>
            what would there be so monstrous in that ? but to their <note type="footnote"> 1 See Appian, Iv. 26. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 See Herodotus, vii. 141-143; viii. 51. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Reading with Reiske <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατάχρυσα</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 The technical term for submission to an enemy.

            slaves, who are insolent and savage barbarians, such as <lb/>
            Plato represents the fiery torturers and executioners in <lb/>
            Hades who preside over the punishment of the impious. <lb/>
            For they make the forum a hell for wretched debtors, and <lb/>
            like vultures devour and rend them limb from limb, <lb/>
            " piercing into their bowels,”1 and stand over others and <lb/>
            prevent their tasting their own grapes or crops, as if they <lb/>
            were so many Tantaluses. And as Darius sent Datis and <lb/>
            Artaphernes to Athens with manacles and chains in their <lb/>
            hands for their captives, so they bring into Greece boxes <lb/>
            full of bonds and agreements, like fetters, and visit the <lb/>
            towns and scour the country round, sowing not like Trip­ <lb/>
            tolemus harmless corn, but planting the toilsome and pro­ <lb/>
            lific and never-ending roots of debts, which grow and <lb/>
            spread all round, and ruin and choke cities. They say that <lb/>
            hares at once give birth and suckle and conceive again, but <lb/>
            the debts of these knaves and barbarians give birth before <lb/>
            they conceive ; for at the very moment of giving they ask <lb/>
            back, and take up what they laid down, and lend what they <lb/>
            take for lending.</p>
          <p>§ v. It is a saying among the Messenians, that " there is <lb/>
            a Pylos before Pylos, and another Pylos too." So it may be <lb/>
            said with respect to these money-lenders, " there is interest <lb/>
            before interest, and other interest too." Then of course they <lb/>
            laugh at those natural philosophers who say that nothing <lb/>
            can come of nothing, for they get interest on what neither <lb/>
            is nor was; and they think it disgraceful to farm out the <lb/>
            taxes, though the law allows it, while they themselves <lb/>
            against the law exact tribute for what they lend, or rather, <lb/>
            if one is to say the truth, defraud as they lend, for he who <lb/>
            receives less than he signs his name for is defrauded. The <lb/>
            Persians indeed think lying a secondary crime, but debt a <lb/>
            principal one, for lying frequently follows upon debt, but <lb/>
            money-lenders tell more lies, for they make fraudulent <lb/>
            entries in their account-books, writing down that they <lb/>
            have given so-and-so so much, when they have really given <lb/>
            less. And the only excuse for their lying is covetousness, <lb/>
            not necessity, not utter poverty, but insatiable greediness, <lb/>
            the outcome of which is without enjoyment and useless to <note type="footnote"> 1 See Homer, “ Odyssey," xi. 578, 579, and context. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="369"/>
            themselves, and fatal to their victims. For neither do <lb/>
            they farm the fields which they rob their debtors of, nor <lb/>
            do they inhabit their houses when they have thrust them <lb/>
            out, nor use their tables or apparel, but first one is ruined, <lb/>
            and then a second is hunted down, for whom the first one <lb/>
            serves as a decoy. For the bane spreads and grows like a <lb/>
            fire, to the destruction and ruin of all who fall into their <lb/>
            clutches, for it consumes one after another; and the <lb/>
            money-lender, who fans and feeds this flame to ensnare <lb/>
            many, gets no more advantage from it but that some time <lb/>
            after he can take his account-book and read how many he <lb/>
            has sold up, how many turned out of house and home, and <lb/>
            track the sources of his wealth, which is ever growing into <lb/>
            a larger pile.</p>
          <p>§ vi. And do not think I say this as an enemy proclaim­ <lb/>
            ing war against the money-lenders, <lb/>
            " For never did they lift my cows or horses,”1 <lb/>
            but merely to prove to those who too readily borrow money <lb/>
            what disgrace and servitude it brings with it, and what <lb/>
            extreme folly and weakness it is. Have you anything ? <lb/>
            do not borrow, for you are not in a necessitous condition. <lb/>
            Have you nothing ? do not borrow, for you will never be <lb/>
            able to pay back. Let us consider either case separately. <lb/>
            Cato said to a certain old man who was a wicked fellow, <lb/>
            " My good sir, why do you add the shame that comes from <lb/>
            wickedness to old age, that has so many troubles of its <lb/>
            own ? " So too do you, since poverty has so many troubles <lb/>
            of its own, not add the terrible distress that comes from <lb/>
            borrowing money and from debt; and do not take away <lb/>
            from poverty its only advantage over wealth, its freedom <lb/>
            from corroding care. For the proverb that says, " I cannot <lb/>
            carry a goat, put an ox on my shoulder," has a ridiculous <lb/>
            ring. Unable to bear poverty, are you going to put on <lb/>
            your back a money-lender, a weight hard to carry even for <lb/>
            a rich man ? How then, will you say, am I to maintain <lb/>
            myself? Do you ask this, having two hands, two legs, <lb/>
            and a tongue, in short, being a man, to love and be loved, <lb/>
            to give and receive benefits ? Can you not be a school- <note type="footnote"> 1 Homer," Iliad," i. 154. </note> <note type="footnote"> B B </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="370"/>
            master or tutor, or porter, or sailor, or make coasting <lb/>
            voyages ? Any of these ways of getting a livelihood is less <lb/>
            disgraceful and difficult than to always have to hear, " Pay <lb/>
            me that thou owest."</p>
          <p>§ VII. The well-known Rutilius went up to Musonius at <lb/>
            Rome, and said to him, " Musonius, Zeus Soter, whom you <lb/>
            imitate and emulate, does not borrow money." And <lb/>
            Musonius smilingly answered, " Neither does he lend." <lb/>
            For you must know Rutilius, himself a lender, was ban­ <lb/>
            tering Musonius for being a borrower. What Stoic in­ <lb/>
            flatedness was all this ! What need was there to bring in <lb/>
            Zeus Soter ? For all nature teaches the same lesson. <lb/>
            Swallows do not borrow money, nor do ants, although <lb/>
            nature has given them no hands, or reason, or profession. <lb/>
            But men have intellect in excess, and so ingenious are they <lb/>
            that they keep near them horses, and dogs, and partridges, <lb/>
            and jackdaws. Why then do you despair, who are as <lb/>
            impressible as a jackdaw, have as much voice as a par­ <lb/>
            tridge, and are as noble as a dog, of getting some person <lb/>
            to befriend you, by looking after him, winning his affec­ <lb/>
            tions, guarding him, fighting his battles ? Do you not see <lb/>
            how many opportunities there are both on land and sea? <lb/>
            As Crates says, <lb/>
            " Miccylus and his wife, to ward off famine <lb/>
            In these bad times, I saw both carding wool." <lb/>
            And King Antigonus asked Cleanthes, when he saw him <lb/>
            at Athens after a long interval, " Do you still grind, <lb/>
            Cleanthes ?” And he replied, " I do, 0 king, but for my <lb/>
            living, yet so as not to desert philosophy." Such was the <lb/>
            admirable spirit of the man who, coming from the mill and <lb/>
            kneading-trough, wrote with the hand that had baked and <lb/>
            ground about the gods, and the moon, and stars, and the <lb/>
            sun. But those kinds of labour are in our view servile! <lb/>
            And so that we may appear free we borrow money, and <lb/>
            flatter and dance attendance on slaves, and give them <lb/>
            dinners and presents, and pay taxes as it were to them, not <lb/>
            on account of our poverty (for no one lends money to a <lb/>
            poor man), but from our love of lavish expenditure. For if <lb/>
            we were content with things necessary for subsistence, the <lb/>
            race of money-lenders would be as extinct as Centaurs and <lb/>
             <pb n="371"/>
            Gorgons are; it is luxury that has created them as much <lb/>
            as goldsmiths, and silversmiths, and perfumers, and dyers <lb/>
            in bright colours. For we do not owe money for bread <lb/>
            and wine, but for estates, and slaves, and mules, and <lb/>
            dining-rooms, and tables, and for our lavish public enter­ <lb/>
            tainments, in our unprofitable and thankless ambition. <lb/>
            And he that is once involved in debt remains in it all his <lb/>
            time, like a horse bitted and bridled that takes one rider <lb/>
            after another, and there is no escape to green pastures and <lb/>
            meadows, but they wander about like those demons who <lb/>
            were driven out of heaven by the gods who are thus <lb/>
            described by Empedocles:— <lb/>
            " Into the sea the force of heaven thrusts them, <lb/>
            The sea rejects them back upon the land ; <lb/>
            To the sun's rays th' unresting earth remits them; <lb/>
            The sun anon whirls them to heaven again." <lb/>
            So one after another usurer or trader gets hold of the <lb/>
            poor wretch, hailing either from Corinth, or Patræ, or <lb/>
            Athens, till he gets set on to by them all, and torn to bits, <lb/>
            and cut into mince-meat as it were for his interest. For <lb/>
            as a person who is fallen into the mire must either get up <lb/>
            out of it or remain in it, and if he turns about in it, and <lb/>
            wallows in it, and bedabbles his body all over in it, he con­ <lb/>
            tracts only the greater defilement, so by borrowing from <lb/>
            one person to pay another and changing their money- <lb/>
            lenders they contract and incur fresh interest, and get into <lb/>
            greater liabilities, and closely resemble sufferers from <lb/>
            cholera, whose case does not admit of cure because they <lb/>
            evacuate everything they are ordered to take, and so ever <lb/>
            add to the disease. So these will not get cleansed from <lb/>
            the disease of debt, but at regular times in the year pay <lb/>
            their interest with pain and agony, and then immediately <lb/>
            another creditor presents his little account, so again their <lb/>
            heads swim and ache, when they ought to have got rid of <lb/>
            their debts altogether, and regained their freedom.</p>
          <p>§ VIII. I now turn my attention to those who are rich <lb/>
            and luxurious, and use language like the following, " Am <lb/>
            I then to go without slaves and hearth and home ? " As if <lb/>
            any dropsical person, whose body was greatly swollen and <lb/>
            who was very weak, should say to his doctor, " Am I then <lb/>
            to become lean and empty ?" And why not, to get well ? <lb/>
             <pb n="372"/>
            And do you too go without a slave, not to be a slave <lb/>
            yourself; and without chattels, not to be another man's <lb/>
            chattel. Listen to a story about two vultures; one was <lb/>
            vomiting and saying it would bring its inside up, and <lb/>
            the other who was by said, " What harm if you do P <lb/>
            For it won't be your inside you bring up, but that dead <lb/>
            body we devoured lately." And so any debtor does not <lb/>
            sell his own estate, or his own house, but his creditor's, <lb/>
            for he has made him by law master of them. Nay, but by <lb/>
            Zeus, says one, my father left me this field. Yes, and <lb/>
            your father also left you liberty and a status in the com­ <lb/>
            munity, which you ought to value more than you do. And <lb/>
            your father begot you with hand and foot, but should <lb/>
            either of them mortify, you pay the surgeon to cut it off. <lb/>
            Thus Calypso clad and "dressed" Odysseus " in raiment <lb/>
            smelling sweet,”1 like the body of an immortal, as a gift <lb/>
            and token of her affection for him; but when his vessel <lb/>
            was upset and he himself immersed, and owing to this wet <lb/>
            and heavy raiment could hardly keep himself on the top <lb/>
            of the waves, he threw it off and stripped himself, and <lb/>
            covered his naked breast with Ino's veil,2 and " swam for <lb/>
            it gazing on the distant shore," 3 and so saved his life, <lb/>
            and lacked neither food nor raiment. What then ? have <lb/>
            not poor debtors storms, when the money-lender stands <lb/>
            over them and says, Pay ? <lb/>
            " Thus spoke Poseidon, and the clouds did gather, <lb/>
            And lashed the sea to fury, and at once <lb/>
            Eurus and Notus and the stormy Zephyr <lb/>
            Blew all together.”4 <lb/>
            Thus interest rolls on interest as wave upon wave, and he <lb/>
            that is involved in debt struggles against the load that <lb/>
            bears him down, but cannot swim away and escape, but <lb/>
            sinks to the bottom, and carries with him to ruin his <lb/>
            friends that have gone security for him. But Crates the <lb/>
            Theban, though he had neither duns nor debts, and was <lb/>
            only disgusted at the distracting cares of housekeeping, <lb/>
            gave up a property worth eight talents, and assumed the <lb/>
            philosopher's threadbare cloak and wallet, and took refuge <note type="footnote"> 1 " Odyssey," v. 264.</note> <note type="footnote">2 " Odyssey,” v. 333-375. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 “ Odyssey,” v. 439.</note> <note type="footnote">4 “ Odyssey,” v. 291-295. </note> <lb/>

            in philosophy and poverty. And Anaxagoras left his <lb/>
            sheep-farm.. But why need I mention these ? since the <lb/>
            lyric poet Philoxenus, obtaining by lot in a Sicilian colony <lb/>
            much substance and a house abounding in every kind of <lb/>
            comfort, but finding that luxury and pleasure and absence <lb/>
            of refinement was the fashion there, said, " By the gods <lb/>
            these comforts shall not undo me, I will give them up," <lb/>
            and he left his lot to others, and sailed home again. But <lb/>
            debtors have to put up with being dunned, subjected to <lb/>
            tribute, suffering slavery, passing debased coin, and like <lb/>
            Phineus, feeding certain winged Harpies, who carry off and <lb/>
            lay violent hands on their food, not at the proper season, <lb/>
            for they get possession of their debtors' corn before it is <lb/>
            sown, and they traffic for oil before the olives are ripe; <lb/>
            and the money-lender says, " I have wine at such and such <lb/>
            a price," and takes a bond for it, when the grapes are yet <lb/>
            on the vine waiting for Arcturus to ripen them.</p>

            <title type="sub">WHETHER LIVE UNKNOWN" BE A WISE PRECEPT.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>§ I. He who uttered this precept1 certainly did not wish <lb/>
            to live unknown, for he uttered it to let all the world know <lb/>
            he was a superior thinker, and to get to himself unjust <lb/>
            glory by exhorting others to shun glory. <lb/>
            " I hate the wise man for himself not wise." 2 <lb/>
            They say that Philoxenus the son of Eryxis and Gnatho <lb/>
            the Sicilian, being exceedingly greedy where good fare was <lb/>
            going, would blow their nose in the dishes, to disgust all <lb/>
            others at the table, that they alone might take their fill of <lb/>
            the choicest dishes. So those that are insatiable pursuers <lb/>
            of glory calumniate glory to others who are their rivals, <lb/>
            that they may get it without antagonists. In this they <note type="footnote"> I Probably Epicurus, as we infer from the very personal § iii. </note><note type="footnote">2 Euripides, Fragm. 930. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="374"/>
            resemble rowers, who face the stern of the vessel but propel <lb/>
            it ahead, that by the recoil from the stroke of their oars <lb/>
            they may reach port, so those that give vent to precepts <lb/>
            like this pursue glory with their face turned in the opposite <lb/>
            direction. For otherwise what need was there to utter a <lb/>
            precept like this, or to write and hand it down to posterity, <lb/>
            if he wished to live unknown to his own generation, who <lb/>
            did not wish to live unknown to posterity ?</p>
          <p>§ II. Look at the matter in the following way.1 Has <lb/>
            not that ‘‘ live unknown ” a villainous ring, as though one <lb/>
            had broken open graves ? Is your life so disgraceful that <lb/>
            we must all be ignorant of it ? For my part I should say, <lb/>
            Even if your life be bad do not live unknown, but be <lb/>
            known, reform, repent; if you have virtue, be not utterly <lb/>
            useless in life; if you are vicious, do not continue unre­ <lb/>
            formed. Point out then and define to whom you recom­ <lb/>
            mend this precept. If to an ignorant or wicked or sense­ <lb/>
            less person, you resemble one who should say to a person in <lb/>
            a fever or delirium, “ Be unknown. Don't let the doctor <lb/>
            know your condition. Go and throw yourself into some <lb/>
            dark place, that you and your ailments may be unknown." <lb/>
            So you say to a vicious man, “ Go off with your vice, and <lb/>
            hide your deadly and irremediable disease from your friends, <lb/>
            fearful to show your superstitious fears, palpitations as it <lb/>
            were, to those who could admonish you and cure you." Our <lb/>
            remote an cestors paid public attention to the sick, and if any <lb/>
            one had either had or cured a similar complaint, he com­ <lb/>
            municated his experience to the patient, and so they say <lb/>
            medical art became great by these contributions from ex­ <lb/>
            perience. We ought also in the same way to expose to <lb/>
            everyone diseased lives and the passions of the soul, and to <lb/>
            handle them, and to examine the condition of each,2 and <lb/>
            say, Are you a passionate man ? Be on your guard against <lb/>
            anger. Are you of a jealous turn ? Look to it. Are you <lb/>
            in love ? I myself was in love once, but I had to repent. <lb/>
            But nowadays people deny and conceal and cloak their <lb/>
            vices, and so fix them deeper in themselves..</p>
          <p>§ III. Moreover if you advise men of worth to live un. <note type="footnote"> 1 Reading with Wyttenbach, ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αλλὰ</foreign> rovro <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὲν ταύτυ̜</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑκάστου</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕκαστον</foreign>.

            known and in obscurity, you say to Epaminondas, Do not <lb/>
            be a general; and to Lycurgus, Do not be a legislator; and <lb/>
            to Thrasybulus, Do not be a tyrannicide; and to Pytha­ <lb/>
            goras, Do not teach ; and to Socrates, Do not discourse; <lb/>
            and first and foremost you bid yourself, Epicurus, to re­ <lb/>
            frain from writing letters to your friends in Asia, and from <lb/>
            enrolling Egyptian strangers among your disciples, and <lb/>
            from dancing attendance on the youths of Lampsacus, and <lb/>
            sending books to all quarters to display your wisdom to all <lb/>
            men and all women, and leaving directions in your will <lb/>
            about your funeral. What is the meaning of those com­ <lb/>
            mon tables of yours ? what that crowd of friends and <lb/>
            handsome youths ? Why those many thousand lines written <lb/>
            and composed so laboriously on Metrodorus, and Aristo­ <lb/>
            bulus, and Chæredemus, that they may not be unknown <lb/>
            even in death, if 1 you ordain for virtue oblivion, for art <lb/>
            inactivity, for philosophy silence, and for success that it <lb/>
            should be speedily forgotten ?</p>
          <p>§ iv. But if you exclude all knowledge about life, like <lb/>
            putting the lights out at a supper party, that you may go <lb/>
            from pleasure to pleasure undetected,2 then live un­ <lb/>
            known." Certainly if I am going to pass my life with the <lb/>
            harlot Hedeia, or my days with Leontium, and spurn at <lb/>
            virtue, and put my summum bonum in sensual gratifica­ <lb/>
            lions, these are ends that require darkness and night, on <lb/>
            these oblivion and ignorance are rightly cast. But if any <lb/>
            one in nature sings the praises of the deity and justice and <lb/>
            providence, and in morals upholds the law and society and <lb/>
            the constitution, and in the constitution what is honourable <lb/>
            and not expedient, why should he " live unknown " P Is it <lb/>
            that he should instruct nobody, inspire in nobody an emu­ <lb/>
            lation for virtue, and be to nobody a pattern in good ?3 <lb/>
            Had Themistocles been unknown at Athens, Greece would <lb/>
            not have repelled Xerxes; had Camillus been unknown at <lb/>
            Rome, Rome would not have remained a state ; had Plato <lb/>
            been unknown to Dion, Sicily would not have won its free­ <lb/>
            dom. And as light, I take it, makes us not only visible <note type="footnote"> 1 Beading <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰ</foreign> (for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἵνα</foreign>) with Xylander and Wyttenbach. </note><note type="footnote"> * Reading with Wyttenbach. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Adopting the suggestion of Wyttenbach, " Forte <foreign xml:lang="grc">καλου̃</foreign>, ut Amiot.<unclear/> 7: </note> <lb/>

            but useful to one another, so knowledge gives not only <lb/>
            glory but impetus to virtue. Epaminondas in obscurity up <lb/>
            to his fortieth year was no use to the Thebans, but when <lb/>
            his merits became known and he was put into power, he <lb/>
            saved his state from ruin, and liberated Greece from slavery, <lb/>
            making his abilities efficacious in emergency through his <lb/>
            reputation like the bright shining of a light. For Sopho­ <lb/>
            cles' words, <lb/>
            " Brightly shines brass in use, but when unused <lb/>
            It groweth dull in time, and mars the house,”1 <lb/>
            are also appropriate to the character of a man, which gets <lb/>
            rusty and senile by not mixing in affairs but living in <lb/>
            obscurity. For mute inglorious ease, and a sedentary life <lb/>
            devoted to leisure, not only injure the body but also the <lb/>
            soul: and as hidden waters overshadowed and stagnant get <lb/>
            foul because they have no outlet, so the innate powers of <lb/>
            unruffled lives, that neither imbibe nor pass on anything, <lb/>
            even if they had any useful element in them once, seem to <lb/>
            be effete and wasted.</p>
          <p>§ V. Have you never noticed how when night comes on <lb/>
            a tired languor seizes the body, and inactive torpor over­ <lb/>
            powers the soul, and reason shrinks within itself like a fire <lb/>
            going out, and feeling quite worn out is gently agitated by <lb/>
            disordered fancies, only just indicating that the man is <lb/>
            alive ? But when the sun rises and scares away deceitful <lb/>
            dreams, and brings on as it were the everyday world 2 and <lb/>
            with its light rouses and stimulates the thoughts and <lb/>
            actions of everybody, then, as Democritus says, " men form <lb/>
            new ideas for the day," and betake themselves to their <lb/>
            various pursuits with mutual impetuosity, as if drawn by <lb/>
            a strong impulse.</p>
          <p>§ vi. And I think that life itself, and the way we come <lb/>
            into the world, is so ordained by the deity that we should <lb/>
            know one another. For everyone comes into this great <lb/>
            universe obscure and unknown casually and by degrees, <lb/>
            but when he mixes with his fellows and grows to maturity <lb/>
            he shines forth, and becomes well-known instead of obscure, <note type="footnote"> 1 Frag. 742. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 “ Dormiens quisque in peculiarem abest mundum, expergefactus in <lb/>
            communem redit.”—Xylander. Compare Herrick's Poem, " Dreames." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="377"/>
            and conspicuous instead of unknown. For knowledge is <lb/>
            not the road to being, as some say, but being to know­ <lb/>
            ledge, for being does not create but only exhibits things, <lb/>
            as death is not the reducing of existence to non-existence, <lb/>
            but rather the result of dissolution is obscurity. So people <lb/>
            considering the Sun as Apollo according to hereditary <lb/>
            and ancient institutions, call him Delius I and Pythius ; <lb/>
            whereas the lord of the world of darkness, whether god or <lb/>
            demon, they call Hades2 (for when we die we go into an <lb/>
            unseen and invisible place), and the lord of dark night and <lb/>
            idle sleep. And I think our ancestors called man himself <lb/>
            by a word meaning light,3 because by their relationship to <lb/>
            light all have implanted in them a strong and vehement <lb/>
            desire to know and to be known. And some philosophers <lb/>
            think that the soul itself is light in its essence, inferring so <lb/>
            on other grounds and because it can least endure igno­ <lb/>
            rance about facts, and hates4 everything obscure, and is <lb/>
            disturbed at everything dark, which inspires fear and sus­ <lb/>
            picion in it, whereas light is so dear and welcome to it <lb/>
            that it thinks nothing otherwise delightful bearable with­ <lb/>
            out it, as indeed light makes every pleasure pastime and <lb/>
            enjoyment gay and cheerful, like the application of some <lb/>
            sweet and general flavour. But the man who thrusts him­ <lb/>
            self into obscurity, and wraps himself up in darkness and <lb/>
            buries himself alive, is like one who is dissatisfied with his <lb/>
            birth, and renounces his being.</p>
          <p>§ VII. And yet Pindar tells us 5 that the abode of the <lb/>
            blest is a glorious existence, where the sun shines bright <lb/>
            through the entire night in meadows red with roses, an <lb/>
            extensive plain full of shady trees ever in bloom never in <lb/>
            fruit, watered by gentle purling streams, and there the <lb/>
            blest ones pass their time away in thinking and talking <lb/>
            about the past and present in social converse.... 6 But <lb/>
            the third road is of those who have lived unholy and law­ <lb/>
            less lives, that thrusts their souls to Erebus and the bottom­ <lb/>
            less pit, where sluggish streams of murky night belch forth <lb/>
            endless darkness, which receive those that are to be punished <note type="footnote"> 1 Bright.</note> <note type="footnote">2 Invisible. </note><note type="footnote">a <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φώς</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Reading with Wyttenbach <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐχθαίρει</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> 5 lieading <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φησίν</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φύσιν</foreign>.</note> <note type="footnote">6 Hiatus hie valde deflendus. </note> <lb/>

            and conceal them in forgetfulness and oblivion. For vul­ <lb/>
            tures do not always prey on the liver of wicked persons <lb/>
            lying on the ground,1 for it is destroyed by fire or has rolled <lb/>
            away ; nor does the carrying of heavy burdens press upon <lb/>
            and tire out the bodies of those that undergo punishment, <lb/>
            “ For their strength has no longer flesh and bones," 2 <lb/>
            nor have the dead any vestige of body that can receive the <lb/>
            infliction of punishment that can make impression ; but in <lb/>
            reality the only punishment of those who have lived ill is <lb/>
            infamy and obscurity and utter annihilation, which hurries <lb/>
            them off to the dark river of oblivion,3 and plunges them <lb/>
            into the abyss of a fathomless sea, involving them in use­ <lb/>
            lessness and idleness, ignorance and obscurity.</p>

          <p>§ I. They say those discourses, like friends, are best and <lb/>
            surest that come to our refuge and aid in adversity, and <lb/>
            are useful. For many who come forward do more harm <lb/>
            than good in the remarks they make to the unfortunate, <lb/>
            as people unable to swim trying to rescue the drowning get <lb/>
            entangled with them and sink to the bottom together. <lb/>
            Now the discourse that ought to come from friends and <lb/>
            people disposed to be helpful should be consolation, and <lb/>
            not mere assent with a man's sad feelings. For we do <lb/>
            not in adverse circumstances need people to weep and wail <lb/>
            with us like choruses in a tragedy, but people to speak <lb/>
            plainly to us and instruct us, that grief and dejection of <lb/>
            mind are in all cases useless and idle and senseless; and <lb/>
            that where the circumstances themselves, when examined <lb/>
            by the light of reason, enable a man to say to himself that <lb/>
            his trouble is greater in fancy than in reality, it is quite ridi­ <lb/>
            culous not to inquire of the body what it has suffered, nor <lb/>
            of the mind if it is any the worse for what has happened, <note type="footnote"> I As was fabled about Tityus, " Odyssey," xi. 576-579. </note><note type="footnote">2“ Odyssey," xi. 219.</note> <note type="footnote">3 So Reiske, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποτμὸν τη̃ς λήης</foreign>. </note> <lb/>

            but to employ external sympathizers to teach us what our <lb/>
            grief is.</p>
          <p>§ II. Therefore let us examine alone by ourselves the <lb/>
            weight of our misfortunes, as if they were burdens. For <lb/>
            the body is weighed down by the burden of what presses on <lb/>
            it, but the soul often adds to the real load a burden of its <lb/>
            own. A stone is naturally hard, and ice naturally cold, <lb/>
            but they do not receive these properties and impressions <lb/>
            from without; whereas with regard to exile and loss of <lb/>
            reputation or honours, as also with regard to their oppo­ <lb/>
            sites, as crowns and office and position, it is not their own <lb/>
            intrinsic nature but our opinion of them that is the gauge <lb/>
            of their real joy or sorrow, so that each person makes them <lb/>
            for himself light or heavy, easy to bear or hard to bear. <lb/>
            When Polynices was asked <lb/>
            " What is't to be an exile ? Is it grievous ? " <lb/>
            he replied to the question, <lb/>
            “ Most grievous, and in deed worse than in word." 1 <lb/>
            Compare with this the language of Alcman, as the poet has <lb/>
            represented him in the following lines. " Sardis, my father's <lb/>
            ancient home, had I had the fortune to be reared in thee, <lb/>
            I should have been dressed in gold as a priest of Cybele,2 <lb/>
            and beaten the fine drums; but as it is my name is Alcman, <lb/>
            and I aID a citizen of Sparta, and I have learned to write <lb/>
            Greek poetry, which makes me greater than the tyrants <lb/>
            Dascyles or Gyges." Thus the very same thing one man's <lb/>
            opinion makes good, like current coin, and another's bad <lb/>
            and injurious.</p>
          <p>§ III. But let it be granted that exile is, as many say and <lb/>
            sing, a grievous thing. So some food is bitter, and sharp, <lb/>
            and biting to the taste, yet by an admixture with it of <lb/>
            sweet and agreeable food we take away its unpleasantness. <lb/>
            There are also some colours unpleasant to look at, that <lb/>
            quite confuse and dazzle us by their intensity and exces­ <lb/>
            sive force. If then we can relieve this by a mixture of <lb/>
            shadow, or by diverting the eye to green or some agreeable <lb/>
            colour, so too can we deal with misfortunes, mixing up <note type="footnote"> 1 Euripides," "Phœnissæ," 388, 389. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Heading <foreign xml:lang="grc">βακέλας</foreign>. Gallus in Latin. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="380"/>
            with them the advantages and pleasant things we still <lb/>
            enjoy, as wealth, or friends, or leisure, and no deficiency in <lb/>
            what is necessary for our subsistence. For I do not think <lb/>
            that there are many natives of Sardis who would not <lb/>
            choose your fortune even with exile, and be content to live <lb/>
            as you do in a strange land, rather than, like snails who <lb/>
            have no other home than their shells, enjoy no other bless­ <lb/>
            ing but staying at home in ease.</p>
          <p>§ IT. As then be in the comedy that was exhorting an un­ <lb/>
            fortunate friend to take courage and bear up against fortune, <lb/>
            when he asked him " how," answered " as a philosopher," <lb/>
            so may we also play the philosopher's part and bear up <lb/>
            against fortune manfully. How do we do when it rains, <lb/>
            or when the North Wind doth blow ? We go to the fire, <lb/>
            or the baths, or the house, or put on another coat: we don't <lb/>
            sit down in the rain and cry. So too can you more than <lb/>
            most revive and cheer yourself for the chill of adversity, <lb/>
            not standing in need of outward aid, but sensibly using <lb/>
            your actual advantages. The surgeon's cupping-glasses <lb/>
            extract the worst humours from the body to relieve and <lb/>
            preserve the rest of it, whereas the melancholy and <lb/>
            querulous by ever dwelling on their worst circumstances, <lb/>
            and thinking only of them, and being engrossed by their <lb/>
            troubles, make even useful things useless to them, at the <lb/>
            very time when the need is most urgent. For as to those <lb/>
            two jars, my friend, that Homer I says are stored in Heaven, <lb/>
            one full of good fortunes, one of bad, it is not Zeus that <lb/>
            presides as the dispenser of them, giving to some a gentle <lb/>
            and even portion, and to others unmixed streams of evils, <lb/>
            but ourselves. For the sensible make their life pleasanter <lb/>
            and more endurable by mitigating their sorrows with the <lb/>
            consideration of their blessings, while most people, like <lb/>
            sieves, let the worst things stick to them while the best <lb/>
            pass through.</p>
          <p>§ v. And so, if we fall into any real trouble or evil, we <lb/>
            ought to get cheerfulness and ease of mind from the con­ <lb/>
            sideration of the actual blessings that are still left to us, <lb/>
            mitigating outward trouble by private happiness. And as <lb/>
            to those things which are not really evil in their nature, <note type="footnote"> 1 " Iliad," xxiv. 527-533. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="381"/>
            but only so from imagination and empty fancy, we must act <lb/>
            as we do with children who are afraid of masks: by bring­ <lb/>
            ing them near, and putting them in their hands, and turn­ <lb/>
            ing them about, we accustom them never to heed them at <lb/>
            all: and so we by bringing reason to bear on it may dis­ <lb/>
            cover the rottenness and emptiness and exaggeration of our <lb/>
            fancy. As a case in point let us take your present exile <lb/>
            from what you deem your country. For in nature no <lb/>
            country, or house, or field, or smithy, as Aristo said, or <lb/>
            surgery, is peculiarly ours, but all such things exist or <lb/>
            rather take their name in connection with the person who <lb/>
            dwells in them or possesses them. For man, as Plato says, <lb/>
            is not an earthly and immovable but heavenly plant, the <lb/>
            head making the body erect as from a root, and turned up <lb/>
            to heaven.1 And so Hercules said well, <lb/>
            " Argive or Theban am I, I vaunt not <lb/>
            To be of one town only, every tower <lb/>
            That does to Greece belong, that is my country." <lb/>
            But better still said Socrates, that he was not an Athenian <lb/>
            or Greek, but a citizen of the world (as a man might say <lb/>
            he was a Rhodian or Corinthian), for he did not confine <lb/>
            himself to Sunium, or Tænarum, or the Ceraunian moun­ <lb/>
            tains. <lb/>
            " See you the boundless reach of sky above, <lb/>
            And how it holds the earth in its soft arms ? ” <lb/>
            These are the boundaries of our country, nor is there <lb/>
            either exile or stranger or foreigner in these, where there is <lb/>
            the same fire, water and air, the same rulers controllers and <lb/>
            presidents, the sun the moon and the morning star, the <lb/>
            same laws to all, under one appointment and ordinance the <lb/>
            summer and winter solstices, the equinoxes, Pleias and <lb/>
            Arcturus, the seasons of sowing and planting ; where there <lb/>
            is one king and ruler, God, who has under his jurisdiction <lb/>
            the beginning and middle and end of everything, and <lb/>
            travels round and does everything in a regular way in <lb/>
            accordance with nature; and in his wake to punish all <lb/>
            transgressions of the divine law follows Justice, whom <note type="footnote"> 1 Plato, “Timseus," p. go A. Compare Ovid, “ Metamorphoses," i. <lb/>
            84-86. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="382"/>
            all men naturally invoke in dealing with one another as <lb/>
            fellow citizens.</p>
          <p>§ vi. As to your not dwelling at Sardis, that is nothing. <lb/>
            Neither do all the Athenians dwell at Colyttus, nor all the <lb/>
            Corinthians at Craneum, nor all the Lacedaemonians at <lb/>
            Pitane. Do you consider all those Athenians strangers and <lb/>
            exiles who removed from Melita to Diomea, where they call <lb/>
            the month Metageitnion,1 and keep the festival Metageitnia <lb/>
            to commemorate their migration, and gladly and gaily accept <lb/>
            and are content with their neighbourhood with other people ? <lb/>
            Surely you would not. What part of the inhabited world <lb/>
            or of the whole earth is very far distant from another <lb/>
            part, seeing that mathematicians teach us that the whole <lb/>
            earth is a mere point compared to heaven ? But we, like <lb/>
            ants or bees, if we get banished from one ant-hill or hive <lb/>
            are in sore distress and feel lost, not knowing or having <lb/>
            learnt to make and consider all things our own, as indeed <lb/>
            they are. And yet we laugh at the stupidity of one who <lb/>
            asserts that the moon shines brighter at Athens than at <lb/>
            Corinth, though in a sort we are in the same case ourselves, <lb/>
            when in a strange land we look on the earth, the sea, the <lb/>
            air, the sky, as if we doubted whether or not they were <lb/>
            different from those we had been accustomed to. For <lb/>
            nature makes us free and unrestrained, but we bind and <lb/>
            confine immure and force ourselves into small and scanty <lb/>
            space. Then too we laugh at the Persian kings, who, if <lb/>
            the story be true, drink only of the water of the Choaspes, <lb/>
            thus making the rest of the world waterless as far as they <lb/>
            are concerned, but when we migrate to other places, we <lb/>
            desire the water of the Cephisus, or we yearn for the <lb/>
            Eurotas, or Taygetus, or Parnassus, and so make the whole <lb/>
            world for ourselves houseless and homeless.</p>
          <p>§ VII. Some Egyptians, who migrated to Ethiopia because <lb/>
            of the anger and wrath of their king, to those who begged <lb/>
            them to return to their wives and children very im­ <lb/>
            modestly exposed their persons, saying that they would <lb/>
            never be in want of wives or children while so provided. <lb/>
            It is far more becoming and less low to say that whoever <note type="footnote"> 1 Derived from <foreign xml:lang="grc">μετὰ, γείτων</foreign>, because then people flitted and changed <lb/>
            their neighbours. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="383"/>
            has the good fortune to be provided with the few neces­ <lb/>
            saries of life is nowhere a stranger, nowhere without home <lb/>
            and hearth, only he must have besides these prudence and <lb/>
            sense, as an anchor and helm, that he may be able to moor <lb/>
            himself in any harbour. For a person indeed who has lost <lb/>
            his wealth it is not easy quickly to get another fortune, <lb/>
            but every city is at once his country to the man who knows <lb/>
            how to make it such, and has the roots by which he can <lb/>
            live and thrive and get acclimatized in every place, as was <lb/>
            the case with Themistocles and Demetrius of Phalerum. <lb/>
            The latter after his banishment became a great friend of <lb/>
            Ptolemy at Alexandria, and not only passed his days in <lb/>
            abundance, but also sent gifts to the Athenians. And <lb/>
            Themistocles, who was publicly entertained at the king's <lb/>
            expense, is stated to have said to his wife and children, <lb/>
            " We should have been ruined, if we had not been ruined." <lb/>
            And so Diogenes the Cynic to the person who said to him, <lb/>
            " The people of Sinope have condemned you to banishment <lb/>
            from Pontus," replied, " And I have condemned them to <lb/>
            stay in Pontus, ‘by the high cliffs of the inhospitable <lb/>
            sea.' " 1 And Stratonicus asked his host at Seriphus, for <lb/>
            what offence exile was the appointed punishment, and being <lb/>
            told that they punished rogues by exile, said, " Why then <lb/>
            are not you a rogue, to escape from this hole of a place ? " <lb/>
            For the comic poet says they get their crop of figs down <lb/>
            there with slings, and that the island is very barely sup­ <lb/>
            plied with the necessaries of life.</p>
          <p>§ VIII. For if you look at the real facts and shun idle <lb/>
            fancy, he that has one city is a stranger and foreigner in <lb/>
            all others. For it does not seem to such a one fair and <lb/>
            just to leave his own city and dwell in another. " It has <lb/>
            been your lot to be a citizen of Sparta, see that you adorn <lb/>
            your native city," whether it be inglorious, or unhealthy, or <lb/>
            disturbed with factions, or has its affairs in disorder. But <lb/>
            the person whom fortune has deprived of his own city, she <lb/>
            allows to make his home in any he fancies. That was an <lb/>
            excellent precept of Pythagoras, " Choose the best kind of <lb/>
            life, custom will make it easy." So too it is wise and <lb/>
            profitable to say here, “Choose the best and pleasantest <note type="footnote"> 1 Euripides, "Iphigenia in Tauris," 253. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="384"/>
            city, time will make it your country, and a conntry that <lb/>
            will not always distract yon and trouble you and give you <lb/>
            various orders such as, ‘ Contribute so much money, Go on <lb/>
            an embassy to Rome, Entertain the prefect, Perform public <lb/>
            duties.' ” If a person in his senses and not altogether silly <lb/>
            were to think of these things, he would prefer to live in <lb/>
            exile in some island, like Gyarus or Cinarus, <lb/>
            " Savage, and fruitless, in repaying tillage," <lb/>
            and that not in dejection and wailing, or using the lan­ <lb/>
            guage of those women in Simonides, <lb/>
            “ I am shut in by the dark roaring sea <lb/>
            That foams all round," <lb/>
            but he will rather be of the mind of Philip, who when he <lb/>
            was thrown in wrestling, and turned round, and noticed <lb/>
            the mark his body made in the dust, said, " 0 Hercules, <lb/>
            what a little part of the earth I have by nature, though <lb/>
            I desire all the world ! "</p>
          <p>§ ix. I think also you have seen Naxos, or at any rate <lb/>
            Hyria, which is close here. But the former was the home <lb/>
            of Ephialtes and Otus, and the latter was the dwelling- <lb/>
            place of Orion. And Alcmæon, when fleeing from the <lb/>
            Furies, so the poets tell us, dwelt in a place recently formed <lb/>
            by the silting of the Achelous ; 1 but I think he chose that <lb/>
            little spot to dwell in ease and quiet, merely to avoid poli­ <lb/>
            tical disturbances and factions, and those furies informers. <lb/>
            And the Emperor Tiberius lived the last seven years of his <lb/>
            life in the island of Capreæ, and the sacred governing <lb/>
            power of the world enclosed in his breast during all that <lb/>
            time never changed its abode. But the incessant and con­ <lb/>
            stant cares of empire, coming from all sides, made not that <lb/>
            island repose of his pure and complete. But he who can <lb/>
            disembark on a small island, and get rid of great troubles, <lb/>
            is a miserable man, if he cannot often say and sing to him­ <lb/>
            self those lines of Pindar, " To love the slender cypress, <lb/>
            and to leave the Cretan pastures lying near Ida. I have <lb/>
            but little land, where I grow strong, and have nothing to <lb/>
            do with sorrow or faction,” 2 or the ordinances of princes, <note type="footnote"> 1 See also Pausanias, viii. 24.</note> <note type="footnote">2 Pindar, Fragm. 126. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="385"/>
            or public duties in political emergencies, Or state functions <lb/>
            hard to get off.</p>
          <p>§ x. For if that seems a good saying of Callimachus, <lb/>
            "Do not measure wisdom by a Persian rope," much less <lb/>
            should we measure happiness by ropes and parasangs, and <lb/>
            if we inhabit an island containing 200 furlongs only, and not <lb/>
            (like Sicily) four days' sail round, ought we to wail and <lb/>
            lament as if we were very unfortunate ? For how does <lb/>
            plenty of room bring about an easy life P Have you not <lb/>
            heard Tantalus saying in the play,1 <lb/>
            " I sow a field that takes twelve days to travel round, <lb/>
            The Berecyntian region," <lb/>
            but shortly after he says, <lb/>
            " My fortunes, that were once as high as heaven, <lb/>
            Now to the ground are fallen, and do say to me, <lb/>
            ‘ Learn not to make too much of earthly things.'" <lb/>
            And Nausithous leaving the spacious Hyperia because of <lb/>
            the proximity of the Cyclopes, and migrating to an island <lb/>
            "far from all enterprising men," 2 and living an unsocial <lb/>
            life, <lb/>
            " Apart from men beside the stormy sea,"3 <lb/>
            yet contrived to make the life of his citizens very pleasant. <lb/>
            And the Cyclades were first inhabited by the sons of Minos, <lb/>
            and afterwards by the sons of Codrus and Neleus, though <lb/>
            foolish people now think they are punished if they are <lb/>
            exiled to them. And yet what island used as a place of <lb/>
            exile is not of larger extent than Scillus, where Xenophon <lb/>
            after his military service saw a comfortable old age ? 4 <lb/>
            And the Academy, a small place bought for only 3,000 <lb/>
            drachmae, was the domicile of Plato and Xenocrates and <lb/>
            Polemo, who taught and lived there all their lives, except <lb/>
            one day every year, when Xenocrates went to Athens to <lb/>
            grace the festival of Dionysus, so they said, and to see the <lb/>
            new plays exhibited. And Theocritus of Chios twitted <note type="footnote"> 1 JEschylus, " Niobe," Fragm. 146. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 “ Odyssey," vi. 8.

            Aristotle with loving to live at the courts of Philip and <lb/>
            Alexander, and preferring to dwell at the mouth of the <lb/>
            Borborus to dwelling in the Academy. For there is a river <lb/>
            near Pella that the Macedonians call Borborus. As to <lb/>
            islands Homer seems to sing their praise, and recommend <lb/>
            them to us as if on purpose, as <lb/>
            " She came to Lemnos, town of sacred Thoas; ”1 <lb/>
            and, <lb/>
            " What Lesbos has, the seat of the immortals; ”2 <lb/>
            and, <lb/>
            “ He captured lofty Scyros, citadel <lb/>
            Of Enyeus ; " a <lb/>
            and, <lb/>
            " And those who from Dulichium came, and from <lb/>
            The sacred islands called th' Echinades, <lb/>
            That lie across the st'a opposite Elis; " 4 <lb/>
            and of the illustrious men that dwelt in islands he men­ <lb/>
            tions AEolus the favourite of the gods, and Odysseus most <lb/>
            wise, and Ajax most brave, and Alcinous most kind to <lb/>
            strangers.</p>
          <p>§ xi. When Zeno learned that the only ship he had left <lb/>
            was with all its freight lost at sea, he said, " Fortune, you <lb/>
            deal kindly with me, confining me to my threadbare cloak <lb/>
            and the life of a philosopher." And a man not altogether <lb/>
            silly, or madly in love with crowds, might, I think, not <lb/>
            blame fortune for confining him in an island, but might <lb/>
            even praise her for relieving him from weariness and <lb/>
            anxiety, and wanderings in foreign countries, and perils by <lb/>
            sea, and the uproar of the forum, and for giving him truly <lb/>
            a secure, quiet, undistracted and private life, putting him as <lb/>
            it were inside a circle in which everything necessary for <lb/>
            him was contained. For what island has not a house, a <lb/>
            promenade, a bath, and fish and hares for those who love <lb/>
            fishing and field-sports ? And the greatest blessing, quiet, <lb/>
            which others frequently pant for, you can freely enjoy.5 <lb/>
            And whereas in the world,5 when men are playing at dice <lb/>
            or otherwise enjoying the privacy of their homes, informers <lb/>
            and busybodies hunt them up and pursue them from their <note type="footnote"> 1 “Iliad,” xiv. 230.</note> <note type="footnote">a “Iliad," xxiv. 544. </note><note type="footnote"> 3“Iliad," ix. 668.</note> <note type="footnote">4 " Iliad," ii. 625, 626. </note><note type="footnote"> 5 So Reiske. </note> <lb/>

            houses and gardens in the suburbs, and drag them by force <lb/>
            to the forum and court, in an island no one comes to bother <lb/>
            one or dun one or to borrow money, or to beg one to be surety <lb/>
            for him or canvass for him: only one's best friends and <lb/>
            intimates come to visit one out of good will and affection, <lb/>
            and the rest of one's life is a sort of holy retirement to <lb/>
            whoever wishes or has learnt to live the life of leisure. <lb/>
            But he who thinks those happy who are always scouring <lb/>
            the country, and pass most of their lives in inns and ferry­ <lb/>
            boats, is like a person who thinks the planets happier than <lb/>
            fixed stars. And yet every planet keeps its order, rolling <lb/>
            in one sphere, as in an island. For, as Heraclitus says, the <lb/>
            sun will never deviate from its bounds, for if it did, the <lb/>
            Furies, who are the ministers of Justice, would find it out.</p>
          <p>§ XII. Let us use such and similar language, my friend, <lb/>
            and harp upon it, to those who are banished to an island, <lb/>
            and are debarred all access with others <lb/>
            “By the sea waves, which many keep apart." 1 <lb/>
            But you who are not tied down to one spot, but only for­ <lb/>
            bidden to live in one, have by that prohibition liberty to <lb/>
            go to all others. Moreover to the considerations, I am not <lb/>
            in office, or a member of the senate, or an umpire in the <lb/>
            games, you may oppose these, I do not belong to any faction, <lb/>
            I have no large sums to spend, I have not to dance atten­ <lb/>
            dance at the doors of the prefect, it is no odds to me who <lb/>
            has got by lot the province, whether he is hot-tempered or <lb/>
            an objectionable person. But just as Archilochus over­ <lb/>
            looked the fruitful fields and vineyards of Thasos, and <lb/>
            abused that island as rocky and uneven, and said of it, <lb/>
            “ It stands like donkey's chine crowned with wild forest," <lb/>
            so we, fixing our eyes only on one aspect of exile, its in­ <lb/>
            glorious state, overlook its freedom from cares, its leisure, <lb/>
            its liberty. And yet people thought the kings of Persia <lb/>
            happy, because they passed their winter in Babylon, their <lb/>
            summer in Media, and the pleasant season of spring at <lb/>
            Susa. So can the exile be present at the Eleusinian mys­ <lb/>
            teries, at the festival of Dionysus at Athens, at the Nemean <note type="footnote"> 1 “ Iliad," xxi. 59. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="388"/>
            games at Argos, at the Pythian games at Delphi, and can <lb/>
            pass on and be a spectator of the Isthmian and Corinthian <lb/>
            games, if he is fond of sight-seeing; and if not, he has <lb/>
            leisure, can walk about, read, sleep without being disturbed, <lb/>
            and can say like Diogenes, " Aristotle has to dine when <lb/>
            Philip thinks fit, Diogenes can dine at any time he himself <lb/>
            chooses," having no business, or magistrate, or prefect, to <lb/>
            put him out of his general habits of living.</p>
          <p>§ XIII. And so it is that you will find few of the wisest <lb/>
            and most intelligent men buried in their own countries, <lb/>
            but most (even without any compulsion) have themselves <lb/>
            weighed anchor, and transferred their course, and removed, <lb/>
            some to Athens, some from it. For who ever bestowed <lb/>
            such encomium upon his country as Euripides did in the <lb/>
            following lines ? <lb/>
            " First we are not a race brought in from other parts, <lb/>
            But are indigenous, when all other cities <lb/>
            Are, draughts-men like, transferred from place to place, <lb/>
            And are imported from elsewhere. And, lady, <lb/>
            If it is not beside the mark to boast, <lb/>
            We have above us a well-tempered sky, <lb/>
            A climate not too hot, nor yet too cold. <lb/>
            And all the finest things in Greece or Asia <lb/>
            We do procure as an attraction here." 1 <lb/>
            And yet the author of these lines went to Macedonia, and <lb/>
            lived all the latter part of his life at the court of Archelaas. <lb/>
            And of course you have heard the following epitaph; <lb/>
            " Here lies Euphorion's son, Athenian Æschylus, <lb/>
            To whom death came in corn-producing Gela." <lb/>
            For he, like Simonides before him, went to Sicily. And <lb/>
            many have changed the commencing words of Herodotus, <lb/>
            " This is the setting forth of the history of Herodotus <lb/>
            of Halicarnassus " into " Herodotus of Thurii." For he <lb/>
            migrated to Thurii, and participated in that colony. As to <lb/>
            the divine and sacred spirit of the Muses, the poet of the <lb/>
            Trojan war, Homer, did not many cities claim him as theirs, <lb/>
            because he did not cry up one city only ? And Hospitable <lb/>
            Zeus has many great honours. <note type="footnote"> 1 Euripides, Fragm. 950. </note> <pb n="389"/>
            </p>
          <p>§ XIV. And if anyone shall say that these pursued glory <lb/>
            and honour, go to the philosophers, and their schools and <lb/>
            lectures, consider those at the Lyceum, the Academy, the <lb/>
            Porch, the Palladium, the Odeum. If you admire and <lb/>
            prefer the Peripatetic school, Aristotle was a native of <lb/>
            Stagira, Theophrastus of Eresus, Strato of Lampsacus, <lb/>
            Glyco of Troas, Aristo of Ceos, Critolaus of Phase! is. If <lb/>
            you prefer the Stoic school, Zeno was a native of Cittium, <lb/>
            Cleanthes of Assus, Chrysippus of Soli, Diogenes of Baby­ <lb/>
            lon, Antipater of Tarsus ; and the Athenian Archidemus <lb/>
            migrated to the country of the Parthians, and left at <lb/>
            Babylon a succession of the Stoic school Who exiled <lb/>
            these men ? Nobody; it was their own pursuit of quiet, <lb/>
            of which no one who is famous or powerful can get much <lb/>
            at home, that made them teach us this by their practice, <lb/>
            while they taught us other things by their precepts. And <lb/>
            even nowadays most excellent and renowned persons live <lb/>
            in strange lands, not in consequence of being expelled or <lb/>
            banished, but at their own option, to avoid business and <lb/>
            distracting cares, and the want of leisure which their own <lb/>
            country would bring them. For it seems to me that the <lb/>
            Muses aided our old writers to complete their finest and <lb/>
            most esteemed works by calling in exile as a fellow-worker. <lb/>
            Thus Thucydides the Athenian wrote the history of the <lb/>
            war between the Peloponnesians and the Athenians in <lb/>
            Thrace near the forest of Scapte, Xenophon wrote at <lb/>
            Scillus in Elis, Philistus in Epirus, Timæus of Taurome­ <lb/>
            nium at Athens, Androtion of Athens at Megara, and <lb/>
            Bacchylides the poet in Peloponnesus. All these and <lb/>
            many more, though exiled from their country, did not <lb/>
            despair or give themselves up to dejection, but so happy <lb/>
            was their disposition that they considered exile a resource <lb/>
            given them by fortune, whereby they obtained universal <lb/>
            fame after their deaths, whereas no memorial is left of those <lb/>
            who were factious against them and banished them.</p>
          <p>§ xv. He therefore is ridiculous who thinks that any <lb/>
            ignominy attaches itself to exile. What say you ? Was Dio­ <lb/>
            genes without glory, whom Alexander saw basking in the <lb/>
            sun, and stopped to ask if he wanted anything, and when he <note type="footnote"> 1 Reiske suggests <foreign xml:lang="grc">Βακχυλίδης</foreign> o <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κει̃ος</foreign>, A very probable suggestion. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="390"/>
            answered, "Nothing, but that you would get a little out <lb/>
            of my light," Alexander, astonished at his spirit, said to <lb/>
            his friends, " If I were not Alexander, I would be Dio­ <lb/>
            genes." Was Camillus without glory when banished from <lb/>
            Rome, of which he is now accounted the second founder? <lb/>
            And indeed Themistocles did not lose by his exile the glory <lb/>
            be bad obtained among the Greeks, but he added to it <lb/>
            among the barbarians, and there is no one so without <lb/>
            honour, so ignoble, who would prefer to be Leobates who <lb/>
            indicted him rather than Themistocles the exile, or Clodius <lb/>
            who banished Cicero rather than the banished one, or <lb/>
            Aristophon the accuser rather than Timotheus who got <lb/>
            driven by him from his country.</p>
          <p>§ xvi. But since a good many are moved by the lines of <lb/>
            Euripides, who seems to bring a strong indictment against <lb/>
            exile, let us see what it is he says in each question and <lb/>
            answer about it. <lb/>
            Jocasta. What is't to be an exile ? Is it grievous ? <lb/>
            Polynices. Most grievous, and in deed worse than in word. <lb/>
            Jocasta. What is its aspect? What is hard for exiles? <lb/>
            Polynices. This is the greatest, that they have no freedom. <lb/>
            Jocasta. This is a slaved life not to speak one's thoughts ! <lb/>
            Polynices. Then one must put up with one's masters: follies.1 <lb/>
            But this is not a right or true estimate.2 For first of all, <lb/>
            not to say out all one thinks is not the action of a slave <lb/>
            but of a sensible man, in times and matters that require <lb/>
            reticence and silence, as Euripides himself has said else­ <lb/>
            where better, <lb/>
            " Be silent where 'tis meet, speak where 'tis safe." <lb/>
            Then as for the follies of one's masters, one has to put up <lb/>
            with them just as much in one's own country as in exile. <lb/>
            Indeed, more frequently have the former reason to fear <lb/>
            that the powerful in cities will act unjustly to them either <lb/>
            through calumny or violence. But his greatest and ab­ <lb/>
            surdest error is that he takes away from exiles freedom of <lb/>
            speech. It is wonderful, if Theodorus had no freedom of <lb/>
            speech, that when Lysimachus the king said to him, "Did <note type="footnote"> I Euripidps, " Phœnissæ," 388-393. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Omitting <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρώτως</foreign>, which probably got in from <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρω̃τον</foreign> following, and <lb/>
            for which Reiske conjectured <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁρᾳ̃ς ώς</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="391"/>
            not your country cast you out because of your character ? " <lb/>
            replied, " Yes, as Semele cast out Dionysus, when unable <lb/>
            to bear him any longer." And when he showed him <lb/>
            Telesphorus in a cage,1 with his eyes scooped out, and his <lb/>
            nose and ears and tongue cut off, and said to him, " This is <lb/>
            how I treat those that act ill to me." * *2 And had not <lb/>
            Diogenes freedom of speech, who, when he visited Philip's <lb/>
            camp just as he was on the eve of offering battle to the <lb/>
            Greeks, and was taken before the king as a spy, told him <lb/>
            be had come to see his insatiable folly, who was going <lb/>
            shortly to stake his dominions and life on a mere die. <lb/>
            And did not Hannibal the Carthaginian use freedom of <lb/>
            speech to Antiochus, though he was an exile, and Antiochus <lb/>
            a king ? For as a favourable occasion presented itself he <lb/>
            urged the king to attack the enemy, and when after sacri­ <lb/>
            fice he reported that the entrails forbade it, Hannibal <lb/>
            chided him and said, " You listen rather to what flesh tells <lb/>
            you than to the instruction of a man of experience." Nor <lb/>
            does exile deprive geometricians or grammarians of their <lb/>
            freedom of speech, or prevent their discussing what they <lb/>
            know and have learnt. Why should it then good and <lb/>
            worthy men ? It is meanness everywhere that stops a <lb/>
            man's speech, ties and gags his tongue, and forces him to <lb/>
            be silent. But what are the next lines of Euripides? <lb/>
            Jocasta. Hopes feed the hearts of exiles, so they say. , <lb/>
            Polynices. Hopes have a flattering smile, but still delay.3 <lb/>
            But this is an accusation against folly rather than exile. <lb/>
            For it is not those who have learnt and know how to enjoy <lb/>
            the present, but those who ever hang on the future, and <lb/>
            hone after what they have not, that float as it were on <lb/>
            hope as on a raft, though they never get beyond the walls. 1 <lb/>
            Jucasta. But did your father's friends do nothing for you ? <lb/>
            Polynices. Be fortunate! Friends are no use in trouble. <lb/>
            Jocasta. Did not your good birth better your condition ? <lb/>
            Polynices, 'Tis bad to want. Birth brought no bread to me.5 <note type="footnote"> 1 Such as Cardinal Balue was shut up by Louis XI. in for fourteen <lb/>
            years. </note><note type="footnote"> I The answer of Theodorns is wanting. </note><note type="footnote"> a Euripides, " Phœnissæ," 396, 397. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 That is, they never get any further. </note><note type="footnote"> 5 Euripides, " Phœnissæ," 402-405. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="392"/>
            But it was ungrateful in Polynices thus to rail against <lb/>
            exile as discrediting his good birth and robbing him of <lb/>
            friends, for it was on account of his good birth that he was <lb/>
            deemed worthy of a royal bride though an exile, and he <lb/>
            came to fight supported by a band of friends and allies, a <lb/>
            great force, as he himself admits a little later, <lb/>
            " Many of the princes of the Danai <lb/>
            And from Mycenæ are with me, bestowing <lb/>
            A sad but necessary kindness on me." 1 <lb/>
            Nor was there any more justice in the lament of his <lb/>
            mother :­ <lb/>
            " I never lit for you the nuptial torch <lb/>
            In marriage customary, nor did Ismenus <lb/>
            Furnish you with the usual solemn bath." 2 <lb/>
            She ought to have been pleased and content to hear that <lb/>
            her son dwelt in such a palace as that at Argos, and in <lb/>
            lamenting that the nuptial torch was not lit, and that he <lb/>
            had not had the usual bath in the river Ismenus, as though <lb/>
            there was no water or fire at Argos for wedded people, she <lb/>
            lays on exile the evils really caused by pride and stupidity.</p>
          <p>§ xvii. But exile, you will say, is a matter of reproach. <lb/>
            It may he among fools, who also jeer at the beggar, the <lb/>
            bald man, the dwarf, aye, and even the stranger and resi­ <lb/>
            dent alien. But those who are not carried away in that <lb/>
            manner admire good men, whether they are poor, or <lb/>
            strangers or exiles. Do we not see that all men adore the <lb/>
            temple of Theseus as well as the Parthenon and Eleusi­ <lb/>
            nium ? And yet Theseus was an exile from Athens, though <lb/>
            it was owing to him that Athens is now inhabited, and he <lb/>
            was banished from a city which he did not merely dwell in, <lb/>
            but bad himself built. And what glory is left to Eleusis, <lb/>
            if we are ashamed of Eumolpus, who migrated from <lb/>
            Thrace, and taught the Greeks (as he still teaches them) <lb/>
            the mysteries ? And who was the father of Codrus that <lb/>
            reigned at Athens? Was it not Melanthus, an exile from <lb/>
            Messene ? And do you not praise the answer of Antis­ <lb/>
            thenes to the person who told him that his mother was a <lb/>
            Phrygian, " So also is the mother of the gods." If you <note type="footnote"> 1 Euripides, " Phœnissæ," 430-432.</note> <note type="footnote">2 Ibid. 344-346. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="393"/>
            are twitted then with exile, why do you not answer, " The <lb/>
            father of the glorious victor Hercules was an exile." <lb/>
            And Cadmus, the grandfather of Dionysus, when he was <lb/>
            sent from home to find Europa, and never came back, <lb/>
            "though a Phœnician born he changed his country," 1 and <lb/>
            migrated to Thebes, and became2 the grandfather of <lb/>
            it Dionysus, who rejoices in the cry of Evoe, the exciter of <lb/>
            women, who delights in frantic honours." As for what <lb/>
            Æschylus obscurely hints at in the line, <lb/>
            " Apollo the chaste god, exile from heaven," <lb/>
            let me keep a religious silence, as Herodotus says. And <lb/>
            Empedocles commences his system of philosophy as fol­ <lb/>
            lows, " It is an ordinance of necessity, an ancient decree of <lb/>
            the gods, when anyone stains his hands with crime and <lb/>
            murder, the long-lived demons get hold of him, so that he <lb/>
            wanders away from the gods for thirty thousand years. <lb/>
            Such is my condition now, that of an exile and wanderer <lb/>
            from the gods." In these words he not only speaks of <lb/>
            himself, but points out that all of us men similarly are <lb/>
            strangers and foreigners and exiles in this world. For he <lb/>
            says, " 0 men, it is not blood or a compounded spirit that <lb/>
            made the being or beginning of the soul, but it is your <lb/>
            earth-born and mortal body that is made up of these." <lb/>
            He calls speciously by the mildest of names the birth of <lb/>
            the soul that has come from elsewhere a living in a strange <lb/>
            country. But the truth is the soul is an exile and wan­ <lb/>
            derer, being driven about by the divine decrees and laws, <lb/>
            and then, as in some sea-girt island, gets joined to the <lb/>
            body like an oyster to its shell, as Plato says, because it <lb/>
            cannot call to mind or remember from what honour and <lb/>
            greatness of happiness it migrated, not from Sardis to <lb/>
            Athens, nor from Corinth to Lemnos or Scyros, but ex­ <lb/>
            changing heaven and the moon for earth and life upon <lb/>
            earth, if it shifts from place to place for ever so short <lb/>
            a time it is put out and feels strange, and fades away like <lb/>
            a dying plant. But although one soil is more suitable to a <note type="footnote"> 1 Reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">χθονὸς</foreign>. " Sic mutandum censet Valekenarius." - Wytten­ <lb/>
            back. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Through his daughter Semele.</note> <note type="footnote">a Herodotus, ii. 171. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="394"/>
            plant than another, and it thrives and grows better on <lb/>
            such a soil, yet no situation can rob a man of his happiness <lb/>
            or virtue or sense. It was in prison that Anaxagoras wrote <lb/>
            his squaring of the circle, and that Socrates, even after <lb/>
            drinking the hemlock, talked philosophically, and begged <lb/>
            his friends to be philosophers, and was esteemed happy by <lb/>
            them. On the other hand, Phaëthon and Tantalus, though <lb/>
            they got up to heaven, fell into the greatest misfortunes <lb/>
            through their folly, as the poets tell as.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>§ I. " Fortune, not wisdom, rules the affairs of mortals." 1 <lb/>
            And does not justice, and fairness, and sobriety, and <lb/>
            decorum rule the affairs of mortals ? Was it of fortune or <lb/>
            owing to fortune that Aristides persevered in his poverty, <lb/>
            when he might have been lord of much wealth ? And that <lb/>
            Scipio after taking Carthage neither saw nor received any <lb/>
            of the spoil ? Was it of fortune or owing to fortune that <lb/>
            Philocrates spent on harlots and fish the money he had <lb/>
            received from Philip ? And that Lasthenes and Euthy­ <lb/>
            crates lost Olynthus, measuring happiness by their belly and <lb/>
            lusts ? Was it of fortune that Alexander the son of Philip <lb/>
            not only himself abstained from the captive women, but <lb/>
            punished others that outraged them ? Was it under the <lb/>
            influence of an evil genius and fortune that Alexander,2 the <lb/>
            son of Priam, intrigued with the wife of his host and ran <lb/>
            away with her, and filled two continents with war and <lb/>
            evils ? For if all these things are due to fortune, what <lb/>
            hinders our saying that cats and goats and apes are under <lb/>
            the influence of fortune in respect of greediness, and lust, <lb/>
            and ribaldry ?</p>
          <p>§ II. And if there are such things as sobriety and justice <lb/>
            and fortitude, with what reason can we deny the existence <lb/>
            of prudence, and if prudence exists, how can we deny the <lb/>
            existence of wisdom ? For sobriety is a kind of prudence, <note type="footnote"> 1 A line from Chæremon. 2</note> <note type="footnote">Better km wn as Paris. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="395"/>
            as people say, and justice also needs the presence of pru­ <lb/>
            dence. Nay more, we call the wisdom and prudence that <lb/>
            makes people good in regard to pleasure self-control and <lb/>
            sobriety, and in dangers and hardships endurance and for­ <lb/>
            titude, and in dealings between man and man and in public <lb/>
            life equity and justice. And so, if we are to ascribe to for­ <lb/>
            tune the acts of wisdom, let us ascribe justice and sobriety <lb/>
            to fortune also, aye, and let us put down to fortune <lb/>
            stealing, and picking pockets, and lewdness, and let us bid <lb/>
            farewell to argument, and throw ourselves entirely on for­ <lb/>
            tune, as if we were, like dust or refuse, borne along and <lb/>
            hurried away by a violent wind. For if there be no <lb/>
            wisdom, it is not likely that there is any deliberation or <lb/>
            investigation of matters, or search for expediency, but <lb/>
            Sophocles only talked nonsense when he said, <lb/>
            " Whatever is sought is found, what is neglected <lb/>
            Escapes our notice ;"1 <lb/>
            and again in dividing human affairs, <lb/>
            " What can be taught I learn, what can be found out <lb/>
            Duly investigate, and of the gods <lb/>
            I ask for what is to be got by prayer." 2 <lb/>
            For what can be found out or learnt by men, if everything <lb/>
            is due to fortune ? And what deliberative assembly of a <lb/>
            state is not annulled, what council of a king is not abro­ <lb/>
            gated, if all things are subject to fortune? whom we abuse <lb/>
            as blind because we ourselves are blind in our dealings <lb/>
            with her. Indeed, how can it be otherwise, seeing that we <lb/>
            repudiate wisdom, which is like plucking out our eyes, and <lb/>

          <p>§ in. Supposing any of us were to assert that seeing is a <lb/>
            matter of fortune, not of eyesight, nor of the eyes that give <lb/>
            light, as Plato says, and that hearing is a matter of for­ <lb/>
            tune, and not the imbibing of a current of air through the <lb/>
            ear and brain, it would be well for us then to be on our <lb/>
            guard against the evidence of our senses. But indeed <note type="footnote"> 1 “Œdipus Tyrannus," 110, 111. Wyttenbach compares Terence, <lb/>

            nature has given us sight and hearing and taste and smell, <lb/>
            and all other parts of the body and their functions, as <lb/>
            ministers of wisdom and prudence. For " it is the mind <lb/>
            that sees, and the mind that hears, everything else is deaf <lb/>
            and blind." And just as, if there were no sun, we should <lb/>
            have perpetual night for all the stars, as Heraclitus says, <lb/>
            so man for all his senses, if he had no mind or reason, <lb/>
            would be little better than the beasts. But as it is, it is <lb/>
            not by fortune or chance that we are superior to them and <lb/>
            masters of them, but Prometheus, that is reason, is the <lb/>
            cause of this, <lb/>
            " Presenting us with bulls, horses, and asses, <lb/>
            To ease us of our toil, and serve instead," <lb/>
            as Æschylus says.! For as to fortune and natural condi­ <lb/>
            tion, most of the beasts are better off than we are. For <lb/>
            some are armed with horns and tusks and stings, and as <lb/>
            for the hedgehog, as Empedocles says, it has its back all <lb/>
            rough with sharp bristles, and some are shod and pro­ <lb/>
            tected by scales and fur and talons and hoofs worn smooth <lb/>
            by use, whereas man alone, as Plato says, is left by nature <lb/>
            naked, unarmed, unshod, and uncovered. But by one gift, <lb/>
            that of reason and painstaking and forethought, nature <lb/>
            compensates for all these deficiencies. " Small indeed is <lb/>
            the strength of man, but by the versatility of his intellect <lb/>
            he can tame the inhabitants of the sea, earth, and air."2 <lb/>
            Nothing is more agile and swift than horses, yet they run <lb/>
            for man; the dog is a courageous and high-spirited crea­ <lb/>
            ture, yet it guards man; fish is most pleasant to the taste, <lb/>
            the pig the fattest of all animals, yet both are food and <lb/>
            delicacies for man. What is huger or more formidable in <lb/>
            appearance than the elephant ? Yet it is man's plaything, <lb/>
            and a spectacle at public shows, and learns to dance and <lb/>
            kneel. And all these things are not idly introduced, but to <lb/>
            the end that they may teach us to what heights reason <lb/>
            raises man, and what things it sets him above, and how it <lb/>
            makes him master of everything. <note type="footnote"> 1 Æschylus, Fragm. 180. Heading <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀντίδουλα</foreign> with Reiske and the <lb/>

            " For we are not good boxers, nor good wrestlers, <lb/>
            Nor yet swift runners," 1 <lb/>
            for in all these points we are less fortunate than the beasts. <lb/>
            But by our experience and memory and wisdom and <lb/>
            cunning, as Anaxagoras says, we make use of them, and <lb/>
            get their honey and milk, and catch them, and drive and <lb/>
            lead them about at our will. And there is nothing of <lb/>
            fortune in this, it is all the result of wisdom and fore­ <lb/>
            thought.</p>
          <p>§ iv. Moreover the labours of carpenters and copper­ <lb/>
            smiths and house-builders and statue-makers are affairs of <lb/>
            mortals, and we see that no success in such trades is got <lb/>
            by fortune or chance. For that fortune plays a very small <lb/>
            part in the life of a wise man, whether coppersmith or <lb/>
            house-builder, and that the greatest works are wrought by <lb/>
            art alone, is shown by the poet in the following lines :­ <lb/>
            " All handicraftsmen go into the street, <lb/>
            Ye that with fan-shaped baskets worship Ergane, <lb/>
            Zeus' fierce-eyed daughter;” a <lb/>
            for Ergane3 and Athene, and not Fortune, do the trades <lb/>
            regard as their patrons. They do indeed say that Nealces,4 <lb/>
            on one occasion painting a horse, was quite satisfied with <lb/>
            his painting in all other respects, but that some foam on <lb/>
            the bridle from the horse's breath did not please him, so <lb/>
            that he frequently tried to rub it out; at last in his anger <lb/>
            he threw his sponge (just as it was, full of colours) at the <lb/>
            picture, and this very wonderfully produced exactly the <lb/>
            effect he desired. This is the only fortunate accident in art <lb/>
            that history records. Artificers everywhere use rules and <lb/>
            weights and measures, that none of their work may be done <lb/>
            at random and anyhow. And indeed the arts may be con­ <lb/>
            sidered as wisdom on a small scale, or rather as emanations <lb/>
            from and fragments of wisdom scattered about among the <note type="footnote"> I Homer, " Odyssey," vii. 246, 247. </note><note type="footnote"> 2Sopb., Frag. 724. </note><note type="footnote"> IS " The Worker." Generally a title of Athene, as Pausanins, i. 24; <lb/>

            necessities of life; as the fire of Prometheus is riddled to <lb/>
            have been divided and scattered about in all quarters of <lb/>
            the world. For thus small particles and fragments of <lb/>
            wisdom, breaking up as it were and getting divided into <lb/>
            pieces, have formed into order.</p>
          <p>§ v. It is strange then that the arts do not require fortune <lb/>
            to attain to their ends, and yet that the most important <lb/>
            and complete of all the arts, the sum total of man's glory <lb/>
            and merit, should be so completely powerless. Why, there <lb/>
            is a kind of wisdom even in the tightening or slackening of <lb/>
            chords, which people call music, and in the dressing of <lb/>
            food, which we call the art of cooking, and in cleaning <lb/>
            clothes, which we call the art of the fuller, and we teach <lb/>
            boys how to put on their shoes and clothes generally, and <lb/>
            to take their meat in the right hand and their bread in the <lb/>
            left, since none of these things come by fortune, but require <lb/>
            attention and care. And are we to suppose that the most <lb/>
            important things which make so much for happiness do <lb/>
            not call for wisdom, and have nothing to do with reason <lb/>
            and forethought ? Why, no one ever yet wetted earth <lb/>
            with water and then left it, thinking it would become <lb/>
            bricks by fortune and spontaneously, or procured wool and <lb/>
            leather, and sat down and prayed Fortune that it might <lb/>
            become clothes and shoes; nor does anyone getting toge­ <lb/>
            ther much gold and silver and a quantity of slaves, and <lb/>
            living in a spacious hall with many doors, and making a <lb/>
            display of costly couches and tables, believe that these <lb/>
            things will constitute his happiness, and give him a pain­ <lb/>
            less happy life secure from changes, unless he be wise also. <lb/>
            A certain person asked the general Ipbicrates in a scolding <lb/>
            way who he was, as he seemed neither a heavy-armed <lb/>
            soldier, nor a bowman, nor a targeteer, and he replied, " I <lb/>
            am the person who rule and make use of all these."</p>
          <p>§ vi. So wisdom is neither gold, nor silver, nor fame, <lb/>
            nor wealth, nor health, nor strength, nor beauty. What is <lb/>
            it then ? It is what can use all these well, and that by <lb/>
            means of which each of these things becomes pleasant and <lb/>
            esteemed and useful, and without which they are useless <lb/>
            and unprofitable and injurious, and a burden and disgrace <lb/>
            to their possessor. So Hesiod's Prometheus gives very <lb/>
            good advice to Epimetheus, "not to receive gifts from <lb/>
             <pb n="399"/>
            Olympian Zeus but to send them back," 1 meaning external <lb/>
            things and things of fortune. For as if he urged one who <lb/>
            knew nothing of music not to play on the pipe, or one who <lb/>
            knew nothing of letters not to read, or one who was not <lb/>
            used to horses not to ride, so he advised him not to take <lb/>
            office if he were foolish, nor to grow rich if he were <lb/>
            illiberal, nor to marry if likely to be ruled by his wife. <lb/>
            For success beyond their merit is to foolish persons a cause <lb/>
            of folly, as Demosthenes said,2 and good fortune beyond <lb/>
            their merit is to those who are not sensible a cause of mis­ <lb/>
            fortune.3 <note type="footnote"> 1 Hesiod, " Works and Days," 86, 87.</note> <note type="footnote">2 " Olynth.," i. 23. </note><note type="footnote">3 The whole of this essay reminds one of the well-known lines of <lb/>
