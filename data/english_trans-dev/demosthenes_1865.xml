          <p>THE delay in bringing out this volume has been chiefly <lb/>
            owing to the labour bestowed upon the Oration for the Crown, <lb/>
            in which after all I feel I have but imperfectly succeeded. <lb/>
            He is indeed a confident man who can satisfy himself upon <lb/>
            such a task. The previous translations which I have con­ <lb/>
            sulted, I should rather say which I have constantly had <lb/>
            before me, are those of Leland, Francis, Lord Brougham, <lb/>
            Spillan, Auger, Jacobs, and Pabst. I believe there are some <lb/>
            others, which I have not seen. These however I have care­ <lb/>
            fully perused and compared; and to all the translators I <lb/>
            am indebted for their assistance, but especially to Jacobs, of <lb/>
            whose valuable notes and dissertations I have made ample <lb/>
            use. It is a pity that his labours have been confined to the <lb/>
            political speeches of Demosthenes.</p>
          <p>Shilleto's edition of the Oration on the Embassy was un­ <lb/>
            fortunately not put into my hands until I had completed the <lb/>
            first half of the translation. The author has proved himself <lb/>
            to be one of the profoundest of English scholars. His plan <lb/>
            of writing critical notes in Latin, and explanatory in English, <lb/>
            is novel, but not unattended with advantage.</p>

          <p>This has justly been considered the greatest speech of the greatest <lb/>
            orator in the world. It derives an additional interest from the cir­ <lb/>
            cumstance that it was the last great speech delivered in Athens. The <lb/>
            subject matter of it is virtually a justification of the whole public <lb/>
            policy and life of Demosthenes; while in point of form it is a defence <lb/>
            of Ctesiphon for a decree which he proposed in favour of Demo­ <lb/>
            sthenes, B. a. 338, not long after the battle of Chaeronea.</p>
          <p>When the news of that disastrous battle reached Athens, the people <lb/>
            were in the utmost consternation. Nothing less was expected than <lb/>
            an immediate invasion of Attica by the conqueror; and strong mea­ <lb/>
            sures were taken, under the advice of Hyperides, to put the city in a <lb/>
            posture of defence. One of the most important was the repair of the <lb/>
            walls and ramparts. Demosthenes at this time held the office of <lb/>
            conservator of walls, having been appointed by his own tribe at the <lb/>
            end of the year B.C. 339. The reparation, which had been com­ <lb/>
            menced before, but suspended during the late campaign, was now <lb/>
            vigorously prosecuted. He himself superintended the work, and <lb/>
            expended on it three talents of his own money, beyond what was <lb/>
            allowed out of the public treasury.</p>
          <p>The fears of the people were not realized. Philip, while he chastised <lb/>
            the Thebans, treated the Athenians with moderation and clemency; <lb/>
            restoring their prisoners without ransom, burying their dead upon <lb/>
            the field, and sending their bones to Athens. He deprived them <lb/>
            indeed of most of their foreign possessions, but even enlarged their <lb/>
            domestic territory by the addition of Oropus.</p>
          <p>It seemed that the whole foundation upon which the credit and in­ <lb/>
            fluence of Demosthenes had rested was overthrown. The hopes which <lb/>
            he had held out of successful resistance to Philip, of re-establishing <lb/>
            Athenian ascendancy, or maintaining the independence of Greece, <lb/>
            were now proved to be fallacious. The alliance of Thebes, his last <lb/>
            great measure for the protection of Athens, appeared to have been <lb/>
            the immediate cause of her defeat and disgrace. The. very moderation <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> B </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="2"/>
            with which Philip had used his victory looked like a reproach to the <lb/>
            orator, who had so often denounced his cruelties before the Athenian <lb/>
            assembly, and warned them of his deadly hostility to Athens.</p>
          <p>The Macedonian party considered that the time was come for the humi. <lb/>
            liation of their adversary. They assailed him with prosecutions. The <lb/>
            peace which Athens concluded with Macedonia was the signal for <lb/>
            war against Demosthenes. But his enemies were mistaken in their <lb/>
            reckoning, when they supposed that the people would feel resentment <lb/>
            against him as the author of their misfortunes. The Athenians took <lb/>
            a juster and nobler view of the matter: they judged not of his coun­ <lb/>
            sels by the result, but by their own intrinsic merit. Demosthenes <lb/>
            came clear and triumphant out of every prosecution; and while <lb/>
            Lysicles the general was condemned to capital punishment for his <lb/>
            misconduct of the war, Demosthenes received from his countrymen a <lb/>
            signal proof of their esteem and confidence, being appointed to pro­ <lb/>
            nounce the funeral oration in honour of the citizens who had fallen at <lb/>
            Chæronea.</p>
          <p>About the same time, and not many months after the battle, Ctesiphon <lb/>
            introduced a bill to the Council of Five Hundred, proposing to reward <lb/>
            Demosthenes for his gifts of money to the public, and for his general <lb/>
            integrity and good conduct as a statesman. It is not unlikely that <lb/>
            the very object of this measure was to stop the attacks upon Demo­ <lb/>
            sthenes, and to give him the opportunity, in case it should be opposed, <lb/>
            of justifying the whole course of his political life. With that view <lb/>
            was inserted the clause eulogising his general character as a states­ <lb/>
            man. The Macedonian party naturally regarded this clause as a <lb/>
            reflection upon themselves, and a virtual condemnation of the policy <lb/>
            which they had for so many years espoused. They felt themselves <lb/>
            therefore compelled to make a stand against it; and they resolved <lb/>
            upon a course, which was open to them according to the Athenian <lb/>
            laws, of indicting Ctesiphon as the author of an illegal measure. His <lb/>
            bill, having been approved by the council, and then brought before <lb/>
            the popular assembly, was passed in the shape of a decree, by which <lb/>
            it was declared to be the will of the council and people of Athens, <lb/>
            " that Demosthenes should be presented with a golden crown, and <lb/>
            that a proclamation should be made in the theatre, at the great <lb/>
            Dionysian festival, at the performance of the new tragedies, an­ <lb/>
            nouncing that Demosthenes was rewarded by the people with a <lb/>
            golden crown for his integrity, for the goodwill which he had <lb/>
            invariably displayed towards all the Greeks and towards the people of <lb/>
            Athens, and also for his magnanimity, and because he had ever both <lb/>
            by word and deed promoted the interests of the people, and been <lb/>
            zealous to do all the good in his power." This decree, as the opposite <lb/>
            party conceived, was open to three objections, two of which were <lb/>
            chiefly of a legal nature; the other, while it equally assumed a legal <lb/>
            form, called in question the real merits of Ctesiphon's motion. An <lb/>
            indictment, embodying all the objections, was preferred before the <lb/>
            archon, the chief magistrate of Athens, to whose cognizance a cri­ <lb/>
            minal proceeding of this kind appertained. The prosecutor was <lb/>
            AEschines, the second of Athenian orators, the deadly enemy of <lb/>
            Demosthenes, who would not only be considered by his party as the <lb/>
             <pb n="3"/>
            attest person to conduct the cause, but was stimulated to it by every <lb/>
            motive of rivalry and revenge. The indictment, after reciting the <lb/>
            decree, alleged that it violated the Athenian laws in three points, as <lb/>
            follows :-</p>
          <p>First, because it was unlawful to make false allegations in any of the <lb/>
            state documents:</p>
          <p>Secondly, because it was unlawful to confer a crown upon any person <lb/>
            who had an account to render of his official conduct; and Demo­ <lb/>
            sthenes was both a conservator of walls and a treasurer of the theoric <lb/>
            fund:</p>
          <p>Thirdly, because it was unlawful to proclaim the honour of a crown in <lb/>
            the theatre at the Dionysian festival, at the performance of the new <lb/>
            tragedies; the law being, that if the council gave a crown, it should <lb/>
            be published in the council-hall; if the people, in the pnyx at the <lb/>
            popular assembly.</p>
          <p>The first of these points raised the substantial question at issue—viz. <lb/>
            whether the decree of Ctesiphon had stated a falsehood, when it <lb/>
            assigned the virtue and patriotism of Demosthenes as reasons for <lb/>
            conferring public honour upon him. The other two, while they were <lb/>
            mainly of a technical character, were strongly relied on by Æschines <lb/>
            as affording him the means of securing a verdict.</p>
          <p>Notice of intention to indict had probably been given at the time when <lb/>
            the decree was passed. The bill was actually preferred on the sixth <lb/>
            of Elapbebolion, B.C. 338, eight months after the battle of Chæronea, <lb/>
            and a few days before the Dionysian festival, at which the honour <lb/>
            conferred upon Demosthenes was to have been proclaimed. It had <lb/>
            this immediate consequence, that the decree of Ctesiphon could not <lb/>
            be carried into effect till after the trial; and thus one end, at least, <lb/>
            was gained by AEschines and his party,-the satisfaction of having <lb/>
            suspended their adversary's triumph. But whether they were deterred <lb/>
            by the failure of other prosecutions against Demosthenes, or whether <lb/>
            they judged from the temper of the people that they had but little <lb/>
            chance of success, the indictment of Ctesiphon was suffered to lie <lb/>
            dormant for more than seven years, and was not brought to trial till <lb/>
            the year B.C. 330. It may seem strange that the law of Athens should <lb/>
            have allowed a criminal prosecution to hang over a man for so long a <lb/>
            period; but it must be borne in mind that the proceeding against <lb/>
            Ctesiphon not only involved a charge personally affecting him, but <lb/>
            had the further, and ostensibly the more important, object of main­ <lb/>
            taming the purity of the law itself, and preventing an upconstitu­ <lb/>
            tional decree from being recorded in the public archives. It is pro­ <lb/>
            bable, however, that the case would never have been revived, but for <lb/>
            the occurrence of political events which seemed to afford a favourable <lb/>
            opportunity.</p>
          <p>Within two years after his victory at Chæronea, Philip had perished by <lb/>
            the hand of an assassin. The hopes that were excited in Greece by <lb/>
            the news of his death were quickly dispelled by the vigorous measures <lb/>
            of his successor. Notwithstanding the efforts of Demosthenes, it was <lb/>
            found impossible to concert any feasible plan for a union of the <lb/>
            Greek states against Macedonia. The rash revolt of the Thebans was <lb/>
            punished by the extirpation of their city, which struck terror into the <note type="footnote"> B 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="4"/>
            very heart of Greece. Athens, suspected of aiding the insurgents, <lb/>
            hastened to appease the conqueror by humble submission; and when <lb/>
            he insisted on the delivery up of their principal orators, including <lb/>
            Demosthenes, it was with difficulty that he was prevailed upon to <lb/>
            accept a less severe measure of satisfaction. The debate which took <lb/>
            place in the Athenian assembly upon this demand of Alexander <lb/>
            shows, that Demosthenes must still have been in high esteem at <lb/>
            Athens. The feelings of the people, notwithstanding their fears, were <lb/>
            against the delivery of the orators; and Phocion's counsel, urging <lb/>
            them to surrender themselves for the public good, was not well <lb/>
            received. Alexander in the year following (B.o. 334) passed over into <lb/>
            Asia, and commenced his career of conquest. Meanwhile Greece had <lb/>
            a breathing time. The states that sighed for freedom looked with <lb/>
            anxious expectation for every intelligence from the scene of war, as if <lb/>
            all their hopes depended on the fate of one man. The further he <lb/>
            penetrated into Asia, the better chance there seemed to be of his <lb/>
            being overwhelmed by the force of the Persian empire. While he was <lb/>
            yet in the defiles of Cilicia, it was confidently asserted by Demosthenes <lb/>
            at Athens, that his army would be trampled under foot by the cavalry <lb/>
            of Darius. The battle of Issus belied this prophecy; yet it was still <lb/>
            believed that the Persian monarchy had resources in itself sufficient <lb/>
            to prevail in the war: and the length of time that Alexander was <lb/>
            occupied in Phoenicia and Egypt, whilst Darius was collecting the <lb/>
            strength of his empire in the East, seemed to favour these sanguine <lb/>
            views.</p>
          <p>About the time that Alexander was marching to fight his last and <lb/>
            decisive battle against the Persian king in Mesopotamia, Agis, king <lb/>
            of Sparta, put himself at the head of a confederacy, which comprised <lb/>
            the greater part of the Peloponnesian states, and prepared to throw <lb/>
            off the Macedonian yoke. Taking his opportunity, whilst Antipater <lb/>
            was engaged in suppressing a Thracian insurrection, he raised his <lb/>
            standard in Laconia, and declared war; but, after gaining some suc­ <lb/>
            cesses and laying siege to Megalopolis, which refused to join the <lb/>
            league, he was defeated in a hard-fought battle by Antipater, and died <lb/>
            fighting with the valour of an ancient Spartan. This was in the <lb/>
            beginning of the year B. o. 330. The confederacy was dissolved, and <lb/>
            the voice of freedom was again changed to that of submission.</p>
          <p>Athens had taken no part in the last movement. The cause of her <lb/>
            neutrality is not quite clear, though it is probably to be attributed to <lb/>
            a want of proper concert and preparation. Had the Athenians sent <lb/>
            their forces to assist Agis in Peloponnesus, they would have been <lb/>
            exposed to the first attack of the enemy, and the dread of this may <lb/>
            have restrained them from rising. A Macedonian garrison was main­ <lb/>
            tained in the Cadmea, which would gain speedy intelligence of any <lb/>
            movement on the part of the Athenians, and the people of the <lb/>
            Bœotian towns were friendly to Macedonia. It is not quite clear <lb/>
            either what part Demosthenes took upon this occasion. Æschines <lb/>
            represents him as boasting that he had kindled the flames of war in <lb/>
            Peloponnesus; and both Plutarch and Dinarchus intimate that he <lb/>
            exerted himself for that purpose: yet AEschines accuses him also of <lb/>
            neglecting so good an opportunity for engaging Athens in the <lb/>
             <pb n="5"/>
            contest. Demosthenes may in prudence have abstained from plunging <lb/>
            the Athenians into a war, for which he saw they were ill prepared, <lb/>
            and at the same time he may have encouraged the Peloponnesians to <lb/>
            make an effort of which, in the event of success, his own country <lb/>
            would equally have reaped the benefit. So timid a policy he would <lb/>
            not certainly have adopted eight years before; but under existing <lb/>
            circumstances it could hardly be a reproach to him, especially when <lb/>
            he observed the timid and temporising spirit which was gradually <lb/>
            gaining ground among his countrymen. Presents of Persian spoil <lb/>
            had been sent to Athens, to decorate the Acropolis. Phocion cone. <lb/>
            sponded with Alexander as a friend; and it was generally repre­ <lb/>
            sented by all who belonged to his party, that resistance to him was <lb/>
            hopeless.</p>
          <p>If such feelings prevailed to a great extent before the defeat of Agis, <lb/>
            they must have been greatly strengthened after that event. Mace­ <lb/>
            donian arms were everywhere triumphant. Alexander had seated <lb/>
            himself on the throne of Darius; Antipater, his viceroy, was irresist­ <lb/>
            ible in Greece: Macedonian ascendancy, which Demosthenes had <lb/>
            exerted himself all his life to oppose, seemed now to be completely <lb/>
            secured. Athens was not what she was even at the time of Chæronea <lb/>
            For sixteen years before that disastrous battle, the voice of Demo­ <lb/>
            sthenes had been continually resounding in the assembly, instructing, <lb/>
            animating, improving, elevating the minds and hearts of his hearers; <lb/>
            exerting such an influence over them, that he may be said to have <lb/>
            raised up, by the force of his own eloquence, a new generation of <lb/>
            patriots. But in the eight years that followed it was very different: <lb/>
            his voice in the cause of freedom and glory had been little heard; <lb/>
            and besides that the people were cowed by the events which had <lb/>
            occurred, a lethargy had fallen on their spirit, for want of some one <lb/>
            to rouse them. —————</p>
          <p>This was the time chosen by Machines for bringing to an issue the long­ <lb/>
            suspended cause. The aspect of affairs both at home and abroad <lb/>
            seemed favourable to the undertaking; and he summoned up all his <lb/>
            force and resolution for the contest. It was to be not only a trial of <lb/>
            strength between the contending parties at Athens,-the favourers of <lb/>
            Macedonian power, and those that regretted the loss of independence, <lb/>
            -but a final and decisive struggle between two rival statesmen, <lb/>
            exasperated against each other by a long series of hostilities. It was <lb/>
            manifest that Ctesiphon was but the nominal defendant; the real <lb/>
            object of attack was Demosthenes, his whole policy and administration. <lb/>
            The interest excited was intense, not only at Athens, but throughout <lb/>
            all Greece; and an immense concourse of foreigners flocked from all <lb/>
            parts to hear the two most celebrated orators in the world. A jury <lb/>
            (of not less than five hundred) was impanelled by the archon; and <lb/>
            before a dense and breathless audience the pleadings began.</p>
          <p>As the speeches of both the orators are preserved to us, we have the <lb/>
            means of comparing one with the other, and forming our opinion of <lb/>
            their respective merits. The world in general have decided as the <lb/>
            people of Athens did, not only upon the oratorical merits of the two <lb/>
            rivals, but upon the principal questions at issue between them. The <lb/>
            accuser, who thought to brand his opponent with eternal infamy, has <lb/>
             <pb n="6"/>
            only added to the lustre of his renown. Independently of the internal <lb/>
            evidence furnished by this and other orations of Demosthenes, which <lb/>
            have carried to the hearts of most readers a conviction of his patriot­ <lb/>
            ism, we cannot fail to be strongly influenced by the judgment of the <lb/>
            Athenians themselves, whom neither their own past misfortunes, nor <lb/>
            the terror inspired by the late victory of Antipater, could deter from <lb/>
            giving a verdict, by which, while they acquitted Demosthenes from <lb/>
            all blame, they in effect declared their approbation of his measures <lb/>
            in opposition to Macedonia.</p>
          <p>The reader who carefully examines the speech of Æschines will not fail <lb/>
            to observe, that he betrays a consciousness of weakness in that part <lb/>
            of his case where he attacks the political character of his rival. He <lb/>
            seems to feel also that he is speaking in opposition to the general <lb/>
            feeling of his hearers. His own character as a politician had been so <lb/>
            dubious, his conduct so open to suspicion, that while he most bitterly <lb/>
            assails his adversary, he is constantly under the necessity of defending <lb/>
            himself. On the whole life, public and private, of Demosthenes, he <lb/>
            pours a torrent of invective; to this the greater part of his speech is <lb/>
            devoted: yet he seems to have been impelled to it rather by hate and <lb/>
            revenge, than by any calculation of advantage. On the other hand, <lb/>
            when he deals with the legal parts of his case, commenting on those <lb/>
            specific violations of Athenian law which Ctesiphon's measure was <lb/>
            charged with, it is evident that his strength lay there; he handles <lb/>
            his subject temperately, skilfully, and carefully, labouring to make <lb/>
            every point clear to the jury, and to impress them with the conviction <lb/>
            that to uphold the laws was the sure way to maintain constitutional <lb/>
            government. On these points he mainly relied, hoping by this means <lb/>
            to secure a verdict, which would give him a triumph over his enemy, <lb/>
            and carry the general opinion over Greece, that the credit and influence <lb/>
            of Demosthenes were extinguished.</p>
          <p>Demosthenes, feeling his weakness as to the legal questions, dexterously <lb/>
            throws them into the middle of his speech, and passes lightly and <lb/>
            rapidly over them, while he devotes his greatest efforts to the vindi­ <lb/>
            cation of his, own merits as a patriot and a statesman. Refusing to <lb/>
            comply with the insidious demand of Æschines, that he should take <lb/>
            the questions in the same order as his accuser, he insists upon his <lb/>
            legal right to conduct his defence as he pleases. Opening with a <lb/>
            modest exordium, to conciliate the favour of the jury, he launches <lb/>
            gradually into the history of his own conduct and measures: present-. <lb/>
            ing first a general view of the condition of Greece when he entered <lb/>
            public life, and of the difficulties under which the Athenians laboured <lb/>
            in their contest with Philip; then setting forth his own views, plans, <lb/>
            and objects, and showing that he had advised a course of action which <lb/>
            both the circumstances of the time and the honour of the country <lb/>
            required. He apologises for the self-praise mixed up with his speech, <lb/>
            on the ground that he was driven to it by his opponent. Entering on <lb/>
            the Sacred War, and the peace of B.O. 346, he labours to exculpate <lb/>
            himself from all share in the errors then committed, imputing them <lb/>
            chiefly to the negligence of the other ambassadors, and to the treachery <lb/>
            of Philocrates and AEschines, who, by the false hopes which they ex­ <lb/>
            cited at Athens, prevented the people from assisting the Phocians <lb/>
             <pb n="7"/>
            Coming to the events which brought on a renewal of the war, he <lb/>
            shows how Philip's ambitious projects and encroachments in every <lb/>
            part of Greece made it necessary to oppose him, especially for the <lb/>
            Athenians, who were menaced at home as well as abroad by his <lb/>
            aggressions in Thrace, Eubœa, and Megara. He pursues these topics <lb/>
            until he has carried with him the feelings of his hearers, which must <lb/>
            have been strongly on his side when he dilated on the glorious issue <lb/>
            of the campaigns in Euboea and the Propontis, and read to them the <lb/>
            decrees of the Byzantines, Perinthians, and Chersonesites, in honour <lb/>
            of Athens, all which were due to the vigorous measures of his own <lb/>
            administration. Having thus secured the goodwill and sympathy of <lb/>
            his judges, he proceeds to discuss the legal charges against Ctesiphon. <lb/>
            Dwelling on them but for a short time, he plunges into a personal <lb/>
            attack upon Ægchines, holding up to ridicule the meanness of his <lb/>
            birth and parentage, and retorting on him the same coarse and op­ <lb/>
            probrious language which had been used towards himself. The bitter. <lb/>
            ness of his invective is only to be excused on the ground of strong <lb/>
            provocation, added to an assurance that his more grave charges of <lb/>
            corruption and treason were well founded. Those charges, so often <lb/>
            advanced before, he here repeats, denouncing more particularly the <lb/>
            conduct of Æschines upon his mission to Delphi, B.O. 339, to which the <lb/>
            disaster of Chæronea was attributable. The account which Æschines <lb/>
            had given of this affair he shows to be false, and enters upon a minute <lb/>
            examination of the proceedings which caused Philip to be appointed <lb/>
            Amphictyonic general, and to march with an invading army, nomi­ <lb/>
            nally against the Amphissian Locrians, really against Boeotia and <lb/>
            Attica. A graphic description is given of the consternation at Athens <lb/>
            on hearing that Philip had seized Elatea. The meeting of the people, <lb/>
            the advice of Demosthenes to them, his embassy to Thebes, the suc­ <lb/>
            cess of his negotiations, and the conclusion of the alliance between <lb/>
            Thebes and Athens are briefly recounted, Demosthenes forcibly point­ <lb/>
            ing out the advantage of his measures, contending that they were not <lb/>
            to be judged by the mere event of the battle, and that it was far <lb/>
            more glorious for his country to be defeated in a struggle for the <lb/>
            independence of Greece, than it would have been to keep aloof from <lb/>
            the contest. Here he makes that noble adjuration, which has in all <lb/>
            ages been admired, appealing to his countrymen by the deeds of their <lb/>
            ancestors, of whom they would have acted most unworthily, had they <lb/>
            without a struggle abandoned the post of honour bequeathed to them. <lb/>
            He himself as a statesman would have deserved execration, had he <lb/>
            advised such a course. The failure of their arms was not to be im­ <lb/>
            puted to the minister, who had done all he could to insure their suc­ <lb/>
            cess, but rather to the commanders, or to evil fortune. As AEschines <lb/>
            had said so much about the ill fortune which attended him, he draws <lb/>
            a comparison between the different fortunes of himself and his rival, <lb/>
            first, of their early life and education, next, of their career as <lb/>
            public men. Æschines from the beginning had taken a part which <lb/>
            put him in opposition to the true interests of Athens, which caused <lb/>
            him to rejoice at her disasters, to quail and tremble at her successes. <lb/>
            He never came forward to assist her by his counsels when she needed <lb/>
            them, but only to censure others who had given their honest advice. <lb/>
             <pb n="8"/>
            because it had not turned out as well as was expected. It was a signal <lb/>
            proof of his malignant disposition, that he had expatiated on the <lb/>
            late disastrous events as if they were a subject of triumph to him, <lb/>
            without shedding a single tear, without any faltering in his voice, <lb/>
            without betraying the least emotion or symptom of grief. In reply <lb/>
            to the challenge of Æschines, to say for what merit he claimed the <lb/>
            reward of a crown, Demosthenes boldly declares, for his incorrupti­ <lb/>
            bility, by which he was distinguished not only from Æschines, but <lb/>
            from the multitude of venal orators in the Grecian world. Had there <lb/>
            been but a few more like himself in other states, Macedonia could <lb/>
            never have risen to greatness upon their ruin. He had done all that <lb/>
            was possible for a single man; and Athens, while she shared the mis­ <lb/>
            fortune of all the Greeks, had the consolation of reflecting, that she <lb/>
            had striven gallantly and bravely to avert the common calamity. <lb/>
            Æschines had lauded the great men of a bygone age, drawing an <lb/>
            invidious contrast between Demosthenes and them. This, says De­ <lb/>
            mosthenes, was not a fair way of judging him: he should be tried by <lb/>
            reference to his own acts, as compared with those of his contempo­ <lb/>
            raries. Yet even from the former comparison he did not shrink; for <lb/>
            he had acted on the same principles as the statesmen of olden time, <lb/>
            striving always to maintain the honour and dignity of Athens. <lb/>
            Attachment to his country, and earnest anxiety for her welfare, had <lb/>
            been his constant and abiding motives of action: throughout his <lb/>
            whole life, in the day of power, in the hour of trial and adversity, <lb/>
            those feelings had never deserted him: that was the test of a good <lb/>
            and honest citizen; by that he ought to be judged.</p>
          <p>Such is, in substance, the argument of this celebrated oration, as far as <lb/>
            relates to the main question in the cause. Some remarks on the <lb/>
            legal points will be found in an Appendix. The effect produced by <lb/>
            the speech upon an Athenian audience can be but faintly imagined <lb/>
            by us who read it at this distance of time. Although Athens was not <lb/>
            then what she had once been; although she was humbled by defeat, <lb/>
            shorn of her honours, stripped of her empire and dependencies, with­ <lb/>
            out allies, without resources, without means of resistance to that iron <lb/>
            power under which all Greece had succumbed; there was still the <lb/>
            remembrance of the past, not yet extinguished by habitual servitude; <lb/>
            there were still vague hopes of future deliverance, and a fire of smothered <lb/>
            indignation burning in the hearts of the people, ready to burst into <lb/>
            a flame at the first favourable opportunity. That such were their <lb/>
            feelings is proved by what occurred seven years afterwards upon the <lb/>
            death of Alexander; when Athens made one convulsive effort for free­ <lb/>
            dom, ere she finally submitted to her fate. Demosthenes stood before <lb/>
            his countrymen, representing all which remained of Athenian dignity <lb/>
            and glory. If any man could help them, it was he. His advice had <lb/>
            always been steady and constant; his warnings should have been <lb/>
            earlier attended to; but even yet there might be need of him. He <lb/>
            was their consolation for the past, their hope for the future. During <lb/>
            the progress of his address, such thoughts rushed upon their minds <lb/>
            with greater and greater force, till they were elevated above them­ <lb/>
            selves, and all the spirit of their ancestors was for the moment <lb/>
            regenerate within them.</p><pb n="9"/>
            
          <p>They could forgive him all his egotism and self-praise. It was the praise <lb/>
            of a life devoted to their service. Where he lauded his own acts most <lb/>
            strongly, he identified them with the glories of his country. What­ <lb/>
            ever good results might have accrued from his measures, he ascribed <lb/>
            the merit less to himself than to the fortune of Athens, or to the <lb/>
            gods, of whom he was but the humble instrument in a righteous <lb/>
            cause. His own eloquence would have been of no avail, had it not <lb/>
            touched the true chord of Athenian feeling. Throughout his whole <lb/>
            political career he had been supported by the judgment and convic­ <lb/>
            tions of the people. Thus he argued, and the people felt it was <lb/>
            impossible for them to find him guilty, without passing sentence upon <lb/>
            themselves, without condemning the policy which Athens had for <lb/>
            a long series of years consistently pursued. The genius of Athens <lb/>
            protected her from such disgrace; and by an overwhelming majority, <lb/>
            which left the accuser no choice but to retire into exile, a verdict was <lb/>
            given for the-defendant.</p>
          <p>I BEGIN, men of Athens, by praying to every God and God­ <lb/>
            dess, that the same goodwill, which I have ever cherished <lb/>
            towards the commonwealth and all of you, may be requited <lb/>
            to me on the present trial.1 I pray likewise-and this spe­ <lb/>
            cially concerns yourselves, your religion, and your honour­ <lb/>
            that the Gods may put it in your minds, not to take counsel <lb/>
            of my opponent touching the manner in which I am to be <lb/>
            heard-that would indeed be cruel !-but of the laws and of <lb/>
            your oath; wherein (besides the other obligations) it is pre­ <lb/>
            scribed that you shall hear both sides alike. This means, not <lb/>
            only that you must pass no pre-condemnation, not only that <lb/>
            you must extend your goodwill equally to both, but also that <lb/>
            you must allow the parties to adopt such order and course of <lb/>
            defence as they severally choose and prefer.</p>
          <p>Many advantages hath Æschines over me on this trial; <lb/>
            and two especially, men of Athens. First, my risk in the <lb/>
            contest is not the same. It is assuredly not the same for me <lb/>
            to forfeit your regard, as for my adversary not to succeed in <note type="footnote"> 1 Quintilian commends the modest opening of this oration, which he <lb/>
            attributes to a, cautious timidity. Cicero thus remarks upon it in the <lb/>
            Orator:— </note><note type="footnote"> "Hie, quern præstitisse diximus cæteris, in illa pro Ctesiphonte <lb/>
            oratione longè optimâ, submissus àprimo; deinde, dum de legibus <lb/>
            disputat, pressus ; post sensim incedens, judices ut vidit ardentes, in <lb/>
            reliquis exultavit audacius." </note><note type="footnote"> It was not unusual with the ancient orators to commence with a <lb/>
            prayer. Thus Lycurgus begins his speech against Leocrates; and Cicero <lb/>
            his defence of Murena. Also, in the defence of Rabirius, (near the <lb/>
            beginning,) there is an appeal, like this of Demosthenes, to all the <lb/>
            Gods and Goddesses. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="10"/>
            his indictment. To me—but I will say nothing untoward 1 <lb/>
            at the outset of my address. The prosecution however is play <lb/>
            to him. 2 My second disadvantage is, the natural disposition <lb/>
            of mankind to take pleasure in hearing invective and accu­ <lb/>
            sation, and to be annoyed by those who praise themselves. <lb/>
            To AEschines is assigned the part which gives pleasure; that <lb/>
            which is (I may fairly say) offensive to all, is left for me. <lb/>
            And if, to escape from this, I make no mention of what I <lb/>
            have done, I shall appear to be without defence against his <lb/>
            charges, without proof of my claims to honour: whereas, if <lb/>
            I proceed to give an account of my conduct and measures, I <lb/>
            shall be forced to speak frequently of myself. I will endea­ <lb/>
            vour then to do so with all becoming modesty: what I am <lb/>
            driven to by the necessity of the case, will be fairly chargeable <lb/>
            to my opponent who has instituted such a prosecution.3</p>
          <p>I think, men of the jury, you will all agree that I, as well <lb/>
            as Ctesiphon, am a party to this proceeding, and that it is a <lb/>
            matter of no less concern to me. It is painful and grievous <lb/>
            to be deprived of anything, especially by the act of one's <lb/>
            enemy; but your goodwill and affection are the heaviest loss, <lb/>
            precisely as they are the greatest prize to gain.</p>
          <p>Such being the matters at stake in this cause, I conjure <lb/>
            and implore you all alike, to hear my defence to the charge <lb/>
            in that fair manner which the laws prescribe-laws, to which <lb/>
            their author, Solon, a man friendly to you and to popular <lb/>
            rights, thought that validity should be given, not only by the <lb/>
            recording of them,4 but by the oath of you the jurors: not that <note type="footnote"> 1 Auger: sinistre. Jacobs: anstössiges. Leland: ominous. There <lb/>

            he distrusted you, as it appears to me ; but, seeing that the <lb/>
            charges and calumnies, wherein the prosecutor is powerful by <lb/>
            being the first speaker, cannot be got over by the defendant, <lb/>
            unless each of you jurors, observing his religious obligation, <lb/>
            shall with like favour receive the arguments of the last <lb/>
            speaker, and lend an equal and impartial ear to both, before <lb/>
            he determines upon the whole case.</p>
          <p>As I am, it appears, on this day to render an account both <lb/>
            of my private life and my public measures, I would fain, as <lb/>
            in the outset, call the Gods to my aid ; and in your presence <lb/>
            I implore them, first, that the goodwill which I have ever <lb/>
            cherished towards the commonwealth and all of you may be <lb/>
            fully requited to me on the present trial; next, that they <lb/>
            may direct you to such a decision upon this indictment, as <lb/>
            will conduce to your common honour, and to the good con­ <lb/>
            science of each individual.</p>
          <p>Had AEschines confined his charge to the subject of the <lb/>
            prosecution, I too would have proceeded at once to my justi­ <lb/>
            fication of the decree.' But since he has wasted no fewer <lb/>
            words in the discussion of other matters, in most of them <lb/>
            calumniating me, I deem it both necessary and just, men of <lb/>
            Athens, to begin by shortly adverting to these points, that <lb/>
            none of you may be induced by extraneous arguments to <lb/>
            shut your ears against my defence to the indictment.</p>
          <p>To all his scandalous abuse of my private life, observe my <lb/>
            plain and honest answer. If you know me to be such as he <lb/>
            alleged-for I have lived nowhere else but among you—let <lb/>
            not my voice be heard, however transcendant my statesman­ <lb/>
            ship ! Rise up this instant and condemn me But if, in <lb/>
            your opinion and judgment, I am far better and of better <lb/>
            descent than my adversary; if (to speak without offence) I <lb/>
            am not inferior, I or mine, to any respectable2 citizens: then <lb/>
            fault of such version is, that it has too many words. He probably fol­ <lb/>
            lowed Auger, who has, " de lea graver stir l'airain;" which, in fact, is <lb/>
            the meaning. Jacobs and Pabst are right. The ordinary meaning of <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">γράψαινόμους</foreign>, , to propose laws,” is here manifestly inapplicable. I <lb/>
            may here also observe that the censure of Lord Brougham for joining <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">δικαίως</foreign> with <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀκου̑σαι</foreign> is equally absurd. The Germans both have it as he <lb/>
            has; nor is it possible, with such a collocation of the words, to take it <lb/>
            otherwise. <note type="footnote"> 1 The decree of the Senate procured by Ctesiphon in favour of <lb/>

            give no credit to him for his other statements-it is plain <lb/>
            they were all equally fictions—but to me let the same good­ <lb/>
            will, which you have uniformly exhibited upon many former <lb/>
            trials, be manifested now. With all your malice, Æschines, <lb/>
            it was very simple to suppose that I should turn from the <lb/>
            discussion of measures and policy to notice your scandal. I <lb/>
            will do no such thing: I am not so crazed. Your lies and <lb/>
            calumnies about my political life I will examine forthwith; <lb/>
            for that loose ribaldry I shall have a word hereafter, if the <lb/>
            jury desire to hear it.</p>
          <p>The crimes whereof I am accused are many and grievous: <lb/>
            for some of them the laws enact heavy-most severe penal­ <lb/>
            ties. The scheme of this present proceeding includes a com­ <lb/>
            bination of spiteful insolence, insult, railing, aspersion, and <lb/>
            everything of the kind; while for the said charges and ac­ <lb/>
            cusations, if they were true, the state has not the means of <lb/>
            inflicting an adequate punishment, or anything like it.1 For <note type="footnote"> 1 Two ways of explaining this difficult passage have occurred to me. <lb/>
            The first is as follows :-The whole scheme of the prosecution shows <lb/>
            that it was instituted to gratify private enmity, not for the good of the <lb/>
            public. If the charges of AEschines against me were true, you could <lb/>
            not sufficiently punish him (Æschines) for preferring them in such a <lb/>
            manner. Why? Because he prefers them by way of insult and slander, <lb/>
            and would not let me be heard in answer to them, if he could have his <lb/>
            way; a course which is most unjust and unconstitutional. He ought to <lb/>
            have made such charges against me directly, and at the time when the <lb/>
            offences were committed; not to have assailed me through Ctesiphon so <lb/>
            long after the time. </note><note type="footnote"> The second method has been partly indicated by a German critic, <lb/>
            cited by Jacobs, and is thus :-The whole scheme of the prosecution <lb/>
            bears the marks of private enmity and malice, while, if the charges were <lb/>
            true, the prosecutor does not put you in a situation to punish me ac­ <lb/>
            cording to my deserts. Why? Because he does not prosecute me <lb/>
            directly for the crimes which he lays to my charge. The penalties of <lb/>
            the law for such crimes could not be enforced by means of the present <lb/>
            prosecution, which is a collateral proceeding, not against me, but against <lb/>
            a third party. The charges in question are made incidentally, and by <lb/>
            way of slander and abuse. The very proposal of Æschines, that I should <lb/>
            not be allowed to speak freely in defence of my political conduct, proves <lb/>
            that his attack upon me is not for the public good; for he must know <lb/>
            that you could never punish me for the crimes of which I am accused, <lb/>
            without giving me a proper and full hearing. No such thing is allowed <lb/>
            by the law, or could be tolerated on any principle of justice. His attack <lb/>
            on me, therefore, can have no good object; it is manifestly dictated by <lb/>
            personal hatred and malice, &amp;c. </note><note type="footnote"> The latter method, I think, is preferable. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="13"/>
            it is not right to debar another of access to the people and <lb/>
            privilege of speech; moreover, to do so by way of malice and <lb/>
            insult—by heaven ! is neither honest, nor constitutional, nor <lb/>
            just. If the crimes which he saw me committing against the <lb/>
            state were as heinous as he so tragically gave-out, he ought <lb/>
            to have enforced the penalties of the law against them at the <lb/>
            time; if he saw me guilty of an impeachable offence, by im­ <lb/>
            peaching and so bringing me to trial before you; if moving <lb/>
            illegal decrees, by indicting me for them. For surely, if he <lb/>
            can prosecute Ctesiphon on my account, he would not have <lb/>
            forborne to indict me myself, had he thought he could con­ <lb/>
            vict me. In short, whatever else he saw me doing to your <lb/>
            prejudice, whether mentioned or not mentioned in his cata­ <lb/>
            logue of slander, there are laws for such things, and punish­ <lb/>
            ments, and trials, and judgments, with sharp and severe <lb/>
            penalties; all of which he might have enforced against me : <lb/>
            and had he done so-had he thus pursued the proper method <lb/>
            with me, his charges would have been consistent with his <lb/>
            conduct. But now he has declined the straightforward and just <lb/>
            course, avoided all proofs of guilt at the time,1 and after this <lb/>
            long interval gets up, to play his part withal, a heap of accusa­ <lb/>
            tion, ribaldry, and scandal. Then he arraigns me, but prose­ <lb/>
            cutes the defendant. His hatred of me he makes the pro­ <lb/>
            minent part of the whole contest; yet, without having ever <lb/>
            met me upon that ground, he openly seeks to deprive a third <lb/>
            party of his privileges. Now, men of Athens, besides all the <lb/>
            other arguments that may be urged in Ctesiphon's behalf, <lb/>
            this, methinks, may very fairly be alleged-that we should <lb/>
            try our own quarrel by ourselves; not leave our private dis­ <lb/>
            pute, and look what third party we can damage. That <lb/>
            surely were the height of injustice.</p>
          <p>It may appear from what has been said, that all his <lb/>
            charges are alike unjust and unfounded in truth. Yet I wish <note type="footnote"> 1 In translating <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοὺς παρ αὑτὰ τὰ πράγματα ἐλέγχους</foreign>, as just above in <lb/>
            the expression <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτὰ τἀδικήματα</foreign>, I adhere to the interpretation of <lb/>
            Wolf and Reiske, which is followed by Leland, Brougham, Spillan, and <lb/>

            to examine them separately, and especially his calumnies <lb/>
            about the peace and the embassy, where he attributed to me <lb/>
            the acts of himself and Philocrates. It is necessary also, and <lb/>
            perhaps proper, men of Athens, to remind you how affairs <lb/>
            stood at those times, that you may .consider every single <lb/>
            measure in reference to the occasion.</p>
          <p>When the Phocian war1 had broken out—not through me, <lb/>
            for I had not then commenced public life—you were in this <lb/>
            position: you wished the Phocians to be saved, though you <lb/>
            saw they were not acting right; and would have been glad <lb/>
            for the Thebans to suffer anything, with whom for a just <lb/>
            reason you were angry; for they had not borne with modera­ <lb/>
            tion their good fortune at Leuctra. The whole of Pelopon­ <lb/>
            nesus was divided: they that hated the Lcedæmonians were <lb/>
            not powerful enough to destroy them; and they that ruled <lb/>
            before by Spartan influence were not masters of the states: <lb/>
            among them, as among the rest of the Greeks, there was a <lb/>
            sort of unsettled strife and confusion. 2 Philip, seeing this—it <lb/>
            was not difficult to see-lavished bribes upon the traitors in <lb/>
            every state, embroiled and stirred them all up against each <lb/>
            other; and so, by the errors and follies of the rest, he was <lb/>
            strengthening himself, and growing up to the ruin of all <lb/>
            But when every one saw that the then overbearing, but now <lb/>
            unfortunate, Thebans, harassed by so long a war, must of <lb/>
            necessity have recourse to you ; Philip, to prevent this, and <lb/>
            obstruct the union of the states, offered to you peace, to <lb/>
            them succour. What helped him then almost to surprise you <lb/>
            in a voluntary snare? The cowardice, shall I call it? or <lb/>
            ignorance-or both-of the other Greeks; who, whilst you <lb/>
            were waging a long and incessant war—and that too for their <lb/>
            common benefit, as the event has shown-assisted you neither <lb/>
            with money nor men, nor anything else whatsoever. You, <lb/>
            being justly and naturally offended with them, lent a willing <lb/>
            ear to Philip.</p>
          <p>The peace then granted was through such means brought <lb/>
            about, not through me, as Æschines calumniously charged. <lb/>

            treaty will be found, on fair examination, to be the cause of <lb/>
            our present condition. The whole matter am I for truth's <lb/>
            sake discussing and going through; for, let there appear to <lb/>
            be ever so much criminality in these transactions, it is surely <lb/>
            nothing to me. The first who spoke and mentioned the sub­ <lb/>
            ject of peace was Aristodemus the actor: the seconder and <lb/>
            mover, fellow-hireling for that purpose with the prosecutor,1 <lb/>
            was Philocrates the Agnusian2—your associate, Æschines, not <lb/>
            mine, though you should burst with lying. Their supporters <lb/>
            -from whatever motives—I pass that by for the present-were <lb/>
            Eubulus and Cephisophon. I had nothing to do with it.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding these facts, which I have stated exactly <lb/>
            according to the truth, he ventured to assert-to such a <lb/>
            pitch of impudence had he come-that I, besides being <lb/>
            author of the peace, had prevented the country making it in <lb/>
            a general council with the Greeks. Why, you—I know not <lb/>
            what name you deserve !-when you saw me robbing the <lb/>
            state of an advantage and connexion so important as you <lb/>
            described just now, did you ever express indignation? did <lb/>
            you come forward to publish and proclaim what you now <lb/>
            charge me with ? If indeed I had been bribed by Philip to <lb/>
            prevent the conjunction of the Greeks, it was your business <lb/>
            not to be silent, but to cry out, to protest, and inform the <lb/>
            people. But you never did so-your voice was never heard <lb/>
            to such a purpose, and no wonder; for at that time no <lb/>
            embassy had been sent to any of the Greeks-they had all <lb/>
            been tested long before; and not a word of truth upon the <lb/>
            subject has Æschines spoken.</p>
          <p>Besides, it is the country that he most traduces by his <lb/>
            falsehoods. For, if you were at the same time calling on <lb/>
            the Greeks to take arms, and sending your own ambassadors <lb/>
            to treat with Philip for peace, you were performing the part of <lb/>
            an Eurybatus,3 not the act of a commonwealth, or of honest <lb/>
            men. But it is false, it is false.

            have sent for them at that period ? For peace ? They all <lb/>
            had it. For war ? You were yourselves deliberating about <lb/>
            peace. It appears therefore, I was not the adviser or the <lb/>
            author of the original peace; and none of his other calumnies <lb/>
            against me are shown to be true.</p>
          <p>- Observe again, after the state had concluded the peace, <lb/>
            what line of conduct each of us adopted. Hence you will <lb/>
            understand who it was that cooperated in everything with <lb/>
            Philip; who that acted in your behalf, and sought the ad­ <lb/>
            vantage of the commonwealth.</p>
          <p>I moved in the council, that our ambassadors should sail <lb/>
            instantly for whatever place they heard Philip was in, and <lb/>
            receive his oath: they would not however, notwithstanding <lb/>
            my resolution.1 What was the effect of this, men of Athens? <lb/>
            I will explain. It was Philip's interest that the interval <lb/>
            before the oaths should be as long as possible ; yours, that it <lb/>
            should be as short. Why? Because you discontinued all <lb/>
            your warlike preparations, not only from the day of swearing <lb/>
            peace, but from the day that you conceived hopes of it; a <lb/>
            thing which Philip was from the beginning studious to con­ <lb/>
            trive, believing—rightly enough-that whatever of our pos­ <lb/>
            sessions he might take before the oath of ratification, he <lb/>
            should hold securely; as none would break the peace on such <lb/>
            account. I, men of Athens, foreseeing and weighing these <lb/>
            consequences, moved the decree, to sail for whatever place <lb/>
            Philip was in, and receive his oath without delay; so that <lb/>
            your allies, the Thracians, might be in possession of the <lb/>
            places which AEschines ridiculed just now. (Serrium, Mvr­ <lb/>
            tium, and Ergisce,) at the time of swearing the oaths; and <lb/>
            that Philip might not become master of Thrace by securing <lb/>
            the posts of vantage, nor provide himself with plenty of <lb/>
            money and troops to facilitate his further designs. Yet this <lb/>
            decree he neither mentions nor reads; but reproaches me, <lb/>
            because, as Councillor, I thought proper to introduce the <lb/>
            ambassadors. Why, what should I have done ? Moved not <lb/>
            to introduce men who were come for the purpose of con­ <lb/>
            ferring with you? or ordered the Manager2 not to assign <note type="footnote"> 1 It is implied that the motion was carried. It then became a reso <lb/>

          <p>" In the Archonship of Mnesiphilus, on the thirteenth of <lb/>
            Hecatombæon, in the presidency of the Pandionian tribe, <lb/>
            Demosthenes son of Demosthenes of Pæania moved:- <lb/>
            Whereas Philip hath sent ambassadors for peace, and hath <lb/>
            it in repair and proper order, he himself taking the profits. The entrance <lb/>
            fee of two obols was paid to him.</p>
          <p>Demosthenes, as member of the council, had introduced the Macedo­ <lb/>
            nian ambassadors, Parmenio, Antipater, and Eurylochus, and moved <lb/>
            that they should be invited to seats of honour at the Dionysian festival. <lb/>
            This was no more than a necessary act of civility, due to the eminent <lb/>
            ministers whom Philip had sent to treat with the Athenians: and there <lb/>
            could not be a more fit person to make the motion than Demosthenes, <lb/>
            who had been one of the ten ambassadors to Philip, and (it seems) the <lb/>
            only councillor among them. Nor did he confine himself to these <lb/>
            formal acts, but during their stay at Athens hospitably entertained <lb/>
            them at his own house, and on their departure accompanied them a part <lb/>
            of the way on horseback. For these attentions he was reproached by <lb/>
            AEschines, as if he had overacted his part, and either sought to curry <lb/>
            favour with Philip, or to make an idle display of his wealth and <lb/>
            importance. <note type="footnote"> 1 In this, as in most of the documents quoted in the first half of the <lb/>
            present speech, there are found serious difficulties, which have led <lb/>
            critics to the conviction that it is not genuine. In the first place, the <lb/>
            name of the archon for the year B.C. 347 was not Mnesiphilus, but <lb/>
            Themistocles. Secondly, not five, but ten ambassadors, were sent to <lb/>
            receive the oath of Philip; and indeed the same ten who had been on <lb/>
            the previous embassy. Thirdly, it is called a resolution of the senate <lb/>
            and people, whereas that which Demosthenes refers to was a resolution <lb/>
            of the senate alone. Fourthly, the ten ambassadors were sent to receive <lb/>
            Philip's oath only, not to take the oath on behalf of their country, <lb/>
            which had been done before. These and some other discrepancies have <lb/>
            led to the conclusion, that the decree (which is not found in all the manu­ <lb/>
            scripts) is an interpolation; and Böckh, in a treatise De Archontibus <lb/>
            Pseudeponymis, suggests the following way of accounting for the error. <lb/>
            He supposes that the decree in the text was found in some ancient col­ <lb/>
            lection by the interpolator; that he mistook the name of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Γραμμα­ <lb/>
            τεὺς</foreign>, or secretary of the council, which was usually appended to decrees, <lb/>
            for the name of the archon; and that, for want of due attention to times <lb/>
            and circumstances, he mistook one document for another. Thus, in <lb/>
            the endeavour to supply the defect of his manuscript, he corrupted the </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> 0 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="18"/>
            agreed upon articles of treaty, it is resolved1 by the Council <lb/>
            and People of Athens, in order that the peace voted in the <lb/>
            first assembly may be ratified, to choose forthwith from the <lb/>
            whole body of Athenians five ambassadors; and that the <lb/>
            persons elected do repair, without any delay, wheresoever they <lb/>
            shall ascertain that Philip is, and as speedily as may be <lb/>
            exchange oaths with him, according to the articles agreed on <lb/>
            between him and the Athenian people, comprehending the <lb/>
            allies of either party. For ambassadors were chosen, Eubulus <lb/>
            of Anaphlystus, Æschines of Cothocidæ, Cephisophon of <lb/>
            Rhamnus, Democrates of Phlya, Cleon of Cothocidæ.”</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding that I had passed this decree, fer the <lb/>
            advantage of Athens, not that of Philip, our worthy ambas­ <lb/>
            sadors so little regarded it, as to sit down in Macedonia three <lb/>
            whole months, until Philip returned from Thrace after <lb/>
            entirely subjugating the country; although they might in <lb/>
            ten days, or rather in three or four, have reached the Helles­ <lb/>
            pont and saved the fortresses, by receiving his oath before he <lb/>
            reduced them : for he would never have touched them in our <lb/>
            presence, or we should not have sworn him; and thus he <lb/>
            would have lost the peace, and not have obtained both, the <lb/>
            peace and the fortresses.</p>
          <p>Such was the first trick of Philip, the first corrupt act of <lb/>
            these accursed miscreants, in the embassy: for which I avow <lb/>
            that I was and am and ever will be at war and variance 2 with <note type="footnote"> text of the author; but gave up the unprofitable work when he had <lb/>
            got half through the speech: and so it happens that the latter half is <lb/>
            free from such interpolation. </note><note type="footnote"> Jacobs, who concurs with this view of Böckh, appears to agree with <lb/>
            him also in another conjecture, viz. that the peace referred to in this <lb/>
            decree is the same which is stated by Diodorus (lib. xvi. 77) to have <lb/>
            been concluded between the Athenians and Philip after his unsuccessful <lb/>
            siege of Byzantium. Other writers have doubted the fact of such a <lb/>
            peace having ever been made. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 The <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεδόχθαι</foreign> depends in construction upon <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἶπε</foreign>, “ moved that it be <lb/>
            resolved." Such was the style in which a decree was drawn up. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Lord Brougham charges Leland with an anti-climax in translating <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολεμεῖν καὶ διαΦέρεσθαι</foreign>, " war and opposition." But he has an incorrect <lb/>
            notion of the meaning of <foreign xml:lang="grc">διαΦέρομαι</foreign>, which he says " indicates a constant <lb/>
            agitation-a restless enmity." The truth is, that <foreign xml:lang="grc">διαΦέρομαι</foreign> is not a <lb/>
            strong word, but means simply—“ I differ with—I dispute with—I am <lb/>
            at variance," or the like. People not familiar with a language may be <lb/>
            Dialed by etymology; for example, the common meanings of versari, </note> <lb/>

            them. But mark another and still greater piece of villany <lb/>
            immediately after. When Philip had sworn to the peace, <lb/>
            having secured Thrace through the-men disobeying my <lb/>
            decree, he again bribes them not to leave Macedonia, until <lb/>
            he had got all ready for his expedition against the Phocians. <lb/>
            His fear was, if they reported to you his design and prepara­ <lb/>
            tion for marching, you might sally forth, sail round with <lb/>
            your galleys to Thermopylae as before, and block up the <lb/>
            strait: his desire, that, the moment you received the intelli­ <lb/>
            gence from them, he should have passed Thermopylae, and <lb/>
            you be unable to do anything. And in such terror and <lb/>
            anxiety was Philip, lest, not with standing he had gained these <lb/>
            advantages, if you voted succour before the destruction of <lb/>
            the Phocians, his enterprise should fail; he hires this despi­ <lb/>
            cable fellow, no longer in common with the other ambassa­ <lb/>
            dors, but by himself individually, to make that statement <lb/>
            and report to you, by which everything was lost.</p>
          <p>I conjure and beseech you, men of Athens, throughout <lb/>
            the trial to remember this; that, if Æschines in his charge <lb/>
            had not travelled out of the indictment,1 neither would I <lb/>
            have spoken a word irrelevant; but since he has resorted to <lb/>
            every species both of accusation and calumny, it is necessary <lb/>
            for me to reply briefly to each of his charges.</p>
          <p>What then were the statements made by Æschines, through <note type="footnote"> conversant, prevaricate, discourse, would not be discovered from the <lb/>
            mere derivation of the words. Familiarity only makes you acquainted <lb/>
            with the conventional usages of language, with the ordinary meanings <lb/>
            of words, and all their niceties and peculiarities. Lord Brougham <lb/>
            was partly deceived by the lexicon, which gives hinc inde jactor <lb/>
            as one of the meanings of <foreign xml:lang="grc">διαφέρομαι</foreign>, and partly by his assuming <lb/>
            that Demosthenes himself would never have been guilty of an anti- <lb/>
            climax. I have myself observed that the ancients were not so particular <lb/>
            about climaxes as modem writers are. But it is further to be observed, <lb/>
            that the force of the passage greatly depends upon the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">τότε καὶ <lb/>
            νυ̑ν καὶ ἀεὶ</foreign>, which are applicable to both the verbs; and also, that the <lb/>
            war which Demosthenes denounces is only a political war, and, so under­ <lb/>
            stood, it does not in effect amount to more than political opposition, <lb/>
            or enmity. </note><note type="footnote"> Jacobs expresses <foreign xml:lang="grc">διαφέρεσθαι</foreign> by Zwist, Pabst by Zwiespalt, Auger by <lb/>

            which everything was lost ? That you should not be alarmed <lb/>
            by Philip's having passed Thermopylæ—that all would be as <lb/>

            it was not words that cemented attachments, (such was his <lb/>

            interest of all alike, Philip, the Phocians, and you, to be <lb/>
            relieved from the harshness and insolence of the Thebans. <lb/>
            His assertions were heard by some with pleasure, on account <lb/>
            of the hatred which then subsisted against the Thebans. <lb/>

            nothing but your enmity with the Thebans and Thessalians, 1 <lb/>

            what I say, read me the decree of Callisthenes, and the letter <lb/>

            Were such the promises this hireling made you ? Come, read <lb/>
            the letter which Philip sent after this to Athens. <note type="footnote"> 1 The duties of the generals were more numerous and varied in the <lb/>
            time of Demosthenes than in the early period of the republic. Formerly <lb/>
            (as mentioned in vol. I. p. 66, note 3,) the ten generals were sent out <lb/>
            all together on warlike service. But this practice was discontinued, as <lb/>
            the wars of Athens began to be more frequent and on a larger scale. One, <lb/>
            two, or three only were then put in command of a single armament. <lb/>
            The generals had also various duties of a civil nature assigned to them, <lb/>
            which required the presence of some of them at home. Such were the <lb/>
            superintendence of all warlike preparations, and the collecting and <lb/>
            dispensing of the military funds. The management of the property- <lb/>
            tax was confided to them, on account of its being peculiarly a war­ <lb/>
            impost. (See Appendix IV. vol. I.) Like other Athenian magistrates, <lb/>
            they had judicial functions to perform in matters under their adminis­ <lb/>
            trative control; as in questions arising out of the property-tax assess­ <lb/>
            ments, and charges for breach of military duty. The power of convoking <lb/>
            extraordinary assemblies of the people was given to them, as being the <lb/>
            persons peculiarly entrusted with the defence of the city and com­ <lb/>
            monwealth. In the time of Demosthenes it would seem that their <lb/>
            functions were divided, probably for convenience; so that one com­ <lb/>
            manded the infantry, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ ἑ̕πὶ τω̑ν ὅπλων</foreign>, or <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁπλιτω̑ν</foreign>, another the cavalry, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ ἐπὶ τω̑ν ἱππέων</foreign>, another took charge of the military chest and fund, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ ἐπὶ τη̑ς διοικήσεως</foreign>. Perhaps others had other tasks assigned to them. <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>“ Philip, king of Macedonia, to the Council and People of <lb/>
            Athens, greeting. Ye know that we have passed Thermopylae, <lb/>
            and reduced Phocis to submission, and put garrisons in the <lb/>
            towns that opened their gates; those that resisted we took <lb/>
            by storm, and rased to the ground, enslaving their inhabitants. <lb/>
            Hearing however, that ye are preparing to assist them, I <lb/>
            have written unto you, that ye may trouble yourselves no <lb/>
            further in the business. For it seems to me, ye are act­ <lb/>
            ing altogether unreasonably; having concluded peace, and <lb/>
            nevertheless taking the field, and that too when the Phocians <lb/>
            are not comprehended in our treaty. Wherefore, if ye abide <lb/>
            not by your engagements, ye will gain no advantage but <lb/>
            that of being the aggressors.,,</p>
          <p>You hear how plainly, in his letter to you, he declares and <lb/>
            asserts to his own allies—“ all this I have done against the <lb/>
            will of the Athenians, and in their despite; therefore if ye <lb/>
            are wise, ye Thebans and Thessalians, ye will regard them as <lb/>
            enemies, and put confidence in me;" not writing in such <lb/>

            of these men, who sold themselves in the embassies, and <lb/>
            reported not a word of truth to you—when the unhappy <lb/>
            Phocians had been deceived and their cities destroyed-what <lb/>
            followed? The despicable Thessalians and stupid Thebais <lb/>
            looked on Philip as a friend, a benefactor, a saviour : he was <lb/>
            everything with them-not a syllable would they hear from <lb/>
            any one to the contrary.. You, though regarding his acts <lb/>
            with suspicion and anger, still observed the peace; for you <lb/>
            could have done nothing alone. The rest of the Greeks, <lb/>
            cheated and disappointed like yourselves, gladly observed the <lb/>
            peace, though they also had in a manner been attacked for a <lb/>
            long time. For when Philip was marching about, subduing <lb/>
            Illyrians and Triballians and some also of the Greeks, and <lb/>
            gaining many considerable accessions of power, and certain <lb/>
            citizens of the states (Æschines among them) took advantage <lb/>
            of the peace to go there and be corrupted; all people then, <lb/>
            against whom he was making such preparations, were at­ <lb/>
            tacked. If they perceived it not, that is another question, no <lb/>
            concern of mine. I was for ever warning and protesting, both <lb/>
            at Athens and wheresoever I was sent. But the states were <lb/>
            diseased; one class in their politics and measures being venal <lb/>
            and corrupt, whilst the multitude of private men either had <note type="footnote"> others, according to Diodorus) of the principal orators and statesmen <lb/>
            of the anti-Macedonian party, among whom were Chares, Hyperides, <lb/>
            and Lycurgus, should be delivered up to him. Phocion advised that <lb/>
            they should be given up, and even urged them to surrender themselves <lb/>
            for the good of their country. Demosthenes recited to the people the <lb/>
            fable of Æsop, where the wolf required the sheep to give up their dogs. <lb/>
            After some discussion Demades offered to intercede with the <unclear>conquer</unclear> <lb/>
            He was sent on an embassy for that purpose, and by his entreaty <lb/>

            dered at. Æschines relates that, on Alexander's first march to Thebes, <lb/>
            Demosthenes was sent on an embassy to him from Athens, and went as <lb/>
            far as Cithæron, where, apprehending danger to himself, be invented <lb/>

            no foresight, or were caught with the bait of present ease and <lb/>
            idleness; and all were under some such influence, only they <lb/>
            imagined each that the mischief would not approach them­ <lb/>
            selves, but that by the peril of others they might secure their <lb/>
            own safety when they chose. The result, I fancy, has been, <lb/>
            that the people, in return for their gross and unseasonable <lb/>
            indolence, have lost their liberty: the statesmen, who ima­ <lb/>
            gined they were selling everything but themselves, discovered <lb/>
            they had sold themselves first; for, instead of friends, as <lb/>
            they were named during the period of bribery, they are now <lb/>
            called parasites, and miscreants, and the like befitting names. <lb/>
            Justly. For no man, 0 Athenians, spends money for the <lb/>
            traitors benefit, or, when he has got possession of his pur­ <lb/>
            chase, employs the traitor to advise him in future proceed­ <lb/>
            ings : else nothing could have been more fortunate than a <lb/>
            traitor. But it is not so-it never could be-it is far other­ <lb/>
            wise ! When the aspirant for power has gained his object, he is <lb/>
            master also of those that sold it; and then - then, I say, knowing <lb/>
            their baseness, he loathes and mistrusts and spurns them. <note type="footnote"> 1 In this, as in the passage a little below, I have in my version made <lb/>
            no distinction between <foreign xml:lang="grc">φίλων</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξένων</foreign>, simply because the English <lb/>
            language does not furnish me with the means. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Εένοι</foreign> (in the sense <lb/>
            here used) are absent friends, who would be <foreign xml:lang="grc">φίλοι</foreign>, if they dwelt in <lb/>
            the same place, but being separated, can only correspond, or occa­ <lb/>
            sionally visit each other and exchange hospitality. The relation that <lb/>
            exists between such persons is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξενία</foreign>, but we have not in our <lb/>
            language any word which expresses that mutual relation; nor indeed <lb/>
            any which expresses the relation between host and guest, as I have <lb/>
            before observed. (Vol. I. p. 97, note 2.) Leland here renders livor, guest, <lb/>
            (which is but half the sense,) and below, intimate, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξενία</foreign>, inti­ <lb/>
            macy. Spillan makes <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξένος</foreign>, friend, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">φίλος</foreign>, intimate. Brougham has <lb/>
            guest for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξένος</foreign>, and hospitality for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξενία</foreign>. Francis the same. But hospi­ <lb/>
            tality will not bear the enlarged sense necessary for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξενία</foreign>. The Gast­ <lb/>
            freund of the German unfortunately cannot be imitated in English. <lb/>
            Auger (like Leland) is inconsistent. In the first passage he has " d'hdtes <lb/>
            et d'amis;” in the next, "ami" for both. The true meaning of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξένοι</foreign> is <lb/>
            fully expressed by a paraphrase in the following passage of Shakspeare: </note><note type="footnote"> " Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia. They were trained <lb/>
            together in their childhood, and there rooted between them then such <lb/>
            an affection, which cannot choose but branch now. Since their more <lb/>
            mature dignities and royal necessities made separation of their society, <lb/>
            their encounters, though not personal, have been royally attomied, with <lb/>
            interchange of gifts, letters, loving embassies; that they have seemed <lb/>

             </p>
          <p>Consider only-for, though the time of the events is past, <lb/>
            the time for understanding them is ever present to the wise : <lb/>
            Lasthenes was called the friend of Philip for a while, until he <lb/>
            betrayed Olynthus—Timolaus for a while, until he destroyed <lb/>
            Thebes—Eudicus and Simus of Larissa for a while, until <lb/>
            they brought Thessaly under Philip's power. Since then the <lb/>
            world has become full of traitors, expelled, and insulted, and <lb/>
            suffering every possible calamity.1 How fared Aristratus in <lb/>
            Sicyon ? how Perilaus in Megara ? Are they not outcasts ? <lb/>
            Hence one may evidently see, it is the vigilant defender of his <lb/>
            country, the strenuous opponent of such men, who secures to <lb/>
            you traitors and hirelings, Æschines, the opportunity of get­ <lb/>
            ting bribes : through the number of those that oppose your <lb/>
            wishes, you are in safety and in pay ; for had it depended on <lb/>
            yourselves, you would have perished long ago.</p>
          <p>Much more could I say about those transactions, yet <lb/>
            methinks too much has been said already. The fault is my <lb/>
            adversary's, for having spirted over me the dregs, 2 I may say, <lb/>
            of his own wickedness and iniquities, of which I was obliged <lb/>
            to clear myself to those who are younger than the events. <lb/>
            You too have probably been disgusted, who knew this man's <lb/>
            venality before I spoke a word. He calls it friendship indeed; <lb/>
            and said somewhere in his speech—“ the man who reproaches <lb/>
            me with the friendship of Alexander." I reproach you with <lb/>
            friendship of Alexander I Whence gotten, or how merited ? <lb/>
            Neither Philip's friend nor Alexander's should I ever call <lb/>
            you ; I am not so mad; unless we are to call reapers and <lb/>
            other hired labourers the friends of those that hire them. <lb/>
            That however is not so-how could it be ? It is nothing of <note type="footnote"> 1 I agree with the German translators, who join the participles <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐλαυ­ <lb/>

            chose that which belonged to Grecian affairs : therefore I am <lb/>

          <p>The conquests which Philip had got and held before I <lb/>
            commenced life as a statesman and orator, I shall pass over, <lb/>
            as I think they concern not me. Those that he was baffled <lb/>
            in from the day of my entering on such duties, I will call to <lb/>
            your recollection, and render an account of them ; premising <lb/>
            one thing only-Philip started, men of Athens, with a great <lb/>
            advantage. It happened that among the Greeks-not some, <lb/>
            but all alike-there sprang up a crop1 of traitors and venal <lb/>
            wretches, such as in the memory of man had never been <lb/>
            before. These he got for his agents and supporters: the <lb/>
            Greeks, already ill-disposed and unfriendly to each other, he <lb/>
            brought into a still worse state, deceiving this people, making <lb/>
            presents to that, corrupting others in every way; and he <lb/>
            split them into many parties, when they had all one interest, <lb/>
            to prevent his aggrandisement. While the Greeks were all in <lb/>
            such a condition-in such ignorance of the gathering and <lb/>
            growing mischief—you have to consider, men of Athens, <lb/>
            wliat policy and measures it became the commonwealth to <lb/>
            adopt, and of this to receive a reckoning from me; for the <lb/>

            “spectacles," taking it in the more general sense of " everything which <lb/>
            you see," which is in accordance with Schaefer's opinion. Undoubtedly <lb/>
            it would make very good sense, if Demosthenes referred to everything <lb/>
            which might be seen in Athens reminding the people of their ancient <lb/>
            glory, such as their public buildings, their walls, the Parthenon, Pro­ <lb/>
            pylæa, and the like. But <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεώρημα</foreign> is more commonly used to signify <lb/>
            a theatrical spectacle or exhibition; and perhaps in connexion with <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁρῶσι</foreign> one rather expects a word of a confined signification. I am there­ <lb/>
            fore inclined to prefer Lord Brougham's version, which agrees with those <lb/>
            of Jacobs, Pabst, Spillan, Leland, and Auger. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Αόγοι</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεωρήματα</foreign> are <lb/>
            aptly joined together; the " public harangues," and the “dramatic exhi­ <lb/>
            bitions." In such dramas as the Persæ, the Supplices, the Heraclidæ, <lb/>
            Athenians were constantly bearing the praises of their ancestors. </note><note type="footnote"> Lord Brougham has been censured likewise for translating <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁρῶσι</foreign> <lb/>
            “contemplate." No doubt he did so purposely, in order to avoid the use <lb/>
            of a verb which would not suit <foreign xml:lang="grc">λόγοις</foreign>. And he was right. The appli­ <lb/>
            cation of a word to two clauses, which strictly is applicable toʹ one only, <lb/>
            is a Greek idiom, but not an English. It might be rendered, “having <lb/>
            before you." I have given it a turn, for brevity's sake. </note><note type="footnote"> The same critic, correcting Lord Brougham's version of <foreign xml:lang="grc">φιλίππῳ <lb/>
            παραχωρη̂σαι</foreign>, “ surrender to Philip," (which I have adopted,) proposes, <lb/>
            “ let slip out of your own keeping into that of Philip;" which shows <lb/>
            that he does not even understand the true sense of <foreign xml:lang="grc">παραχωρει̂ν</foreign>, which is, <lb/>
            “ to yield to another by retiring, or stepping out of the way," loco <lb/>

            In this, which the critic designates as a literal and verbatim translation, <lb/>
            there is one pleonasm and one gross error, which any good schoolboy <lb/>

            I acknowledge it. But what should I have done ? I put this <lb/>
            question to you, dismissing all else: Amphipolis, Pydna, <lb/>
            Potidæa, Halonnesus—I mention none of them : Serrium, <lb/>
            Doriscus, the ravaging of Peparethus, and any similar wrongs <lb/>
            which the country has suffered—I know not even of their oc­ <lb/>
            currence. You indeed said, that by talking of these I had <lb/>
            brought the people into a quarrel, although the resolutions, <lb/>
            respecting them were moved by Eubulus and Aristophon <lb/>
            and Diopithes—not by me, you ready utterer of what suits <lb/>
            your purpose! Neither will I speak of these now. But I <lb/>
            ask—the man who was appropriating to himself Euboea, and <lb/>
            making it a fortress against Attica, and attempting Megara, <lb/>
            and seizing Oreus, and razing Porthmus, and setting up <lb/>
            Philistides as tyrant in Oreus, Clitarchus in Eretria, and <lb/>
            subjugating the Hellespont, and besieging Byzantium, and <lb/>
            destroying some of the Greek cities, restoring exiles to others, <lb/>
            -was he by all these proceedings committing injustice, <lb/>
            breaking the truce, violating the peace, or not ? Was it meet <lb/>
            that any of the Greeks should rise up to prevent these pro­ <lb/>
            ceedings, or not ? If not-if Greece was to present the spec­ <lb/>
            tacle (as it is called) of a Mysian prey,1 whilst Athenians had <lb/>
            life and being, then I have exceeded my duty in speaking <lb/>
            on the subject-the commonwealth has exceeded her duty, <lb/>
            which followed my counsels—I admit that every measure <lb/>
            has been a misdeed, a blunder of mine. But if some one <lb/>
            ought to have arisen to prevent these things, who but the <lb/>
            Athenian people should it have been ? Such then was the <lb/>

          <p>It was he that infringed the peace by taking our ships: it <lb/>

            Athens, greeting. Your ambassadors, Cephisophon, Demo­ <lb/>
            critus, and Polycritus, came to me and conferred about the <lb/>
            release of the galleys which Laomedon commanded. Upon the <lb/>
            whole, I think you must be very simple, if you imagine I do <lb/>
            not see that those galleys were commissioned, under the pre­ <lb/>
            tence of conveying corn from the Hellespont to Lemnos, to <lb/>
            relieve the Selymbrians, whom I am besieging, and who are <lb/>
            not included in the friendly treaty subsisting between us. <note type="footnote"> 1 We have seen that by the last decree the people had ordered a <lb/>
            meeting of the council to be convened, to elect ambassadors to. Philip. <lb/>
            The presidents and generals, to whom that task was entrusted, convene <lb/>
            the council accordingly, and lay before them the business for which <lb/>
            they were called,—(<foreign xml:lang="grc">χρηματίζειν</foreign> is the usual word, signifying “to intro­ <lb/>
            duce the topic of discussion, the business of the day.") The council <lb/>
            proceed to execute the order of the people, and elect the ambassadors. <lb/>
            That is their <foreign xml:lang="grc">ψήφισμα</foreign>, the senatorial decree containing their appoint­ <lb/>
            ment of ambassadors, pursuant to the decree of the popular assembly. <lb/>
            The document has perplexed commentators, but really has no diffi­ <lb/>
            culty. Schömann explains it in his treatise " De Comitiis," (94.). <unclear>Am</unclear> <lb/>

             <pb n="35"/>
            And these instructions were given, without leave of the <lb/>
            Athenian people, by certain magistrates and others who are <lb/>
            not now in office, but who are anyways desirous for the <lb/>
            people to exchange our present amity for a renewal of war, <lb/>
            and are far more anxious for such a consummation than to <lb/>
            relieve the Selymbrians. They suppose it will be a source of <lb/>
            income to themselves: however, I scarcely think it is for <lb/>
            your advantage or mine. Wherefore I release you the vessels <lb/>
            carried into my port; and for the future, if, instead of allow­ <lb/>
            ing your statesmen to adopt malignant measures, you will <lb/>
            punish them, I too will endeavour to maintain the peace. <lb/>
            Farewell."</p>
          <p>Here is no mention by him of Demosthenes, or any charge <lb/>
            against me. Why then, while he complains of the others, <lb/>
            makes he no mention of my acts? Because he must have <lb/>
            noticed his own aggressions, had he written aught concerning <lb/>
            me; for on these I fixed myself—these I kept resisting. And <lb/>
            first I proposed the embassy to Peloponnesus,1 when into <lb/>
            Peloponnesus he began to steal; next that to Eubcea,2 when <lb/>
            on Eubœa he was laying his hands; then the expedition (no <lb/>
            longer an embassy) to Oreus, and that to Eretria, when he <lb/>
            established rulers in those cities. Afterwards I despatched all <lb/>
            the armaments, by which Chersonesus was preserved, and <lb/>
            Byzantium, and all our allies ; whence to you there accrued <lb/>
            the noblest results-praises, eulogies, honours, crowns, thanks <lb/>
            from those you succoured; whilst the people attacked-those <lb/>
            that trusted you then obtained deliverance, those that disre­ <lb/>
            garded you have had often to remember your warnings, and <lb/>
            to be convinced that you were not only their friends, but wise <lb/>
            men also and prophets : for all that you predicted has come <lb/>
            to pass.</p>
          <p>That Philistides would have given a great deal to keep <lb/>
            Oreus—Clitarchus a great deal to keep Eretria—Philip him­ <lb/>

            chus and Philistides lodged with you, Æschines, and you were <lb/>
            their host. The commonwealth regarded them as enemies, <lb/>
            whose offers were neither just nor advantageous, and expelled <lb/>
            them; but they were your friends. None of their designs <lb/>
            thea were accomplished;1 you slanderer-who say of me, <lb/>
            that I aID silent when I have got something, and bawl when <lb/>
            I have spent it!2 That is not your custom. You bawl <lb/>
            when you have something, and will never stop, unless the <lb/>
            jury stop you by disfranchisement to-day.3</p>

            drew up the same words that Ctesiphon here has now drawn <lb/>
            up, and the crown was proclaimed in the theatre-for this <lb/>
            now is the second proclamation in my favour4—Æschines, <lb/>

            passage of the corn-trade, he advanced to Thrace; the Byzan­ <lb/>

            that they had not made alliance on such terms, he threw up <lb/>
            intrenchments before the city, planted batteries, and laid <lb/>
            siege to it. What course hereupon it became you to take, I <lb/>
            will not ask again; it is manifest to all. But who was it <lb/>

            to Haliartus,1 and again not many days after to Corinth; <lb/>
            albeit the Athenians of that time had many causes of resent­ <lb/>
            ment against both Corinthians and Thebans for their acts in <lb/>
            the Decelean war:2 but they showed no resentment, none. <lb/>
            And yet neither of these steps took they, AEschines, for bene­ <lb/>
            factors, nor were they blind to the danger; but they would <lb/>
            not for such reasons abandon people who sought their protec­ <lb/>
            tion ; for the sake of renown and glory they willingly exposed <lb/>
            themselves to peril; just and noble was their resolve ! For <lb/>
            to all mankind the end of life is death, though one keep <lb/>
            oneself shut up in a closet;3 but it becomes brave men to <lb/>
            strive always for honour, with good hope before them,4 and to <lb/>
            endure courageously whatever the Deity ordains.</p>
          <p>Thus did your ancestors, thus the elder among yourselves. <lb/>
            For, though the Lacedæmonians were neither friends nor <lb/>
            benefactors, but had done many grievous injuries to our state, <lb/>
            yet when the Thebans, victorious at Leuctra, sought their <lb/>
            destruction, you prevented it, not fearing the power and <lb/>
            reputation then possessed by the Thebans, nor reckoning up <lb/>
            the merits of those whom you were about to fight for. And <lb/>
            so you demonstrated to all the Greeks, that, however any <lb/>
            people may offend you, you reserve your anger against them <lb/>
            for other occasions; but should their existence or liberty be <lb/>
            imperilled, you will not resent your wrongs or bring them <lb/>
            into account. <note type="footnote"> 1 This was B.O. 395, at the breaking out of the war, in which Athens, <lb/>

            p. 64.) The battle of Corinth, in which the Lacedæmonians defeated <lb/>

          <p>And not in these instances only hath such been your <lb/>
            temper. Again, when the Thebans were taking possession of <lb/>
            Eubœa,1 you looked not quietly on—you remembered not <lb/>
            the wrongs done you by Themison and Theodorus in the <lb/>
            affair of Oropus,2 but assisted even them. It was the time <lb/>
            when the volunteer captains3 first offered themselves to the <lb/>
            state, of whom I was one;—but of this presently. However, <lb/>
            it was glorious that you saved the island, but far more glo­ <lb/>
            rious that, when you had got- their persons and their cities in <lb/>
            your power, you fairly restored them to people who had <lb/>
            ill-used you, and made no reckoning of your wrongs in an <lb/>
            affair where you were trusted.</p>
          <p>Hundreds of cases which I could mention I pass over­ <lb/>
            sea-fights, land-marches, campaigns, both in ancient times <lb/>
            and in your own, all of which the commonwealth has under­ <lb/>
            taken for the freedom and safety of the Greeks in general. <lb/>
            Then, having observed the commonwealth engaging in con­ <lb/>
            tests of such number and importance for the interests of <lb/>
            others, what was I to urge, what course to recommend her, <lb/>
            when the question in a manner concerned herself?—To revive <lb/>
            grudges, I suppose, against people who wanted help, and to <lb/>
            seek pretences for abandoning everything. And who might <lb/>
            not justly have killed me, had I attempted even by words to <lb/>
            tarnish any of the honours of Athens ? For the thing itself <lb/>
            I am certain, you would never have done--had you wished, <lb/>
            what was to hinder you?—any lack of opportunity?—bad <lb/>
            you not these men to advise it ?</p>
          <p>I must return to the next in date of my political acts; and <lb/>
            here again consider what was most beneficial for the state. I <lb/>
            saw, men of Athens, that your navy was decaying, and that, <lb/>
            while the rich were getting off4 with small payments, citizens <note type="footnote"> 1 As to the war in Eubœa, see vol. I. pp. 114, 275. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Themison and Theodoras were the rulers of Eretria, who seized <lb/>

            to ship off their troops in three days. The orators frequently boasted <lb/>
            of this expedition: for example, Demosthenes in the speech against <lb/>

            and the state, by reason thereof, missing her opportunities of <lb/>
            action. I therefore proposed a law, by which I compelled <lb/>
            the one class (the rich) to perform their duty, and stopped <lb/>
            the oppression of the poor; and-what was most useful to <lb/>
            the country—I caused her preparations to be made in time. <lb/>
            And being indicted for it, I appeared on the charge before <lb/>
            you, and was acquitted; and the prosecutor did not get his <lb/>
            portion1 of the votes. But what sums, think ye, the chief <lb/>
            men of the Boards, or those in the second and third degrees, <lb/>
            offered me, first, not to propose that law, secondly, when I <lb/>
            had recorded it, to drop it on the abatement-oath ?3 Such <lb/>
            sums, men of Athens, as I should be afraid to tell you. And <lb/>
            no wonder they did so; for under the former laws they might <lb/>
            divide the charge between sixteen, spending little or nothing <note type="footnote"> a total exemption from public taxes at the expense of a trifling con­ <lb/>
            tribution." But they should have avoided a reference to any other <lb/>

            to the explanation of Julius Pollux, it was applied also to the oath <lb/>
            sworn by a person who threatened another with a <foreign xml:lang="grc">γραΦὴ παρανόμων</foreign>, or <lb/>
            indictment for an illegal measure. Any citizen was at liberty to indict <lb/>
            the author of a decree, though passed by the popular assembly, within <lb/>
            a twelvemonth after the passing; and it'became void, if the indictment <lb/>
            succeeded. He gave notice of his intention to prosecute by a public <lb/>
            declaration, supported by oath, that he believed the decree in question <lb/>
            to be illegal or unconstitutional; and this had the effect of suspending <lb/>
            the validity of the decree until after the trial. Therefore, as Schömann <lb/>
            observes (De Comitiis, 159), this oath, which had the effect of adjourn­ <lb/>
            ing a law, was so called by analogy to the legal oath. See the Appendix <lb/>

          <p>“ In the archonship of Polycles, on the sixteenth of Boedro­ <lb/>
            mion, in, the presidency of the Hippothoontian tribe, Demo­ <lb/>
            sthenes son of Demosthenes of Pæania introduced a law for <lb/>
            the naval service,2 instead of the former one under which <lb/>
            there were the associations of joint-captains; and it was <lb/>
            passed by the council and people. And Patrocles of Phlyus <lb/>
            preferred an indictment against Demosthenes for an illegal <note type="footnote"> 1 Schömann, in his chapter on Decrees (De Comitiis, 130), after <lb/>
            mentioning the ordinary signification of the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ψήΦισμα</foreign>, viz. “a law <lb/>
            passed by the people in assembly," and " a bill, or decree of the council," <lb/>
            proceeds to say, that it has a third and more extended meaning. “ By <lb/>
            that name," he says,“ the Athenians designated those public records <lb/>
            which did not contain the actual bill or decree, but merely an account <lb/>
            of the circumstances connected with the proposal or adoption thereof <lb/>
            or a statement of the measures passed in consequence by the people. <lb/>
            The object of this was, to have at hand always, in case they should be <lb/>
            wanted again, authentic documents of the whole transaction." In <lb/>
            support of his assertion, he refers to this and some other of the records <lb/>
            cited in the Oration on the Crown. Their genuineness, however, has <lb/>
            been questioned. In this one, as well as in others, the name of the <lb/>
            archon is false. I doubt whether the word ever bore the extended <lb/>
            meaning assigned to it by Schömann. Suppose the record in the text <lb/>
            could be called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ψήΦισμα</foreign>, it could hardly be the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ψήΦισμακαθ᾽</foreign> b <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰσῆλθσν <lb/>
            τὴνγραΦὴν</foreign>, which Demosthenes requires to be read, but of which it <lb/>
            contains only a short recital. It is possible, indeed, that Demosthenes, <lb/>
            though he calls on the clerk to read the decree, produced in fact only <lb/>
            the document which is preserved to us, and which might answer his <lb/>
            purpose quite as well, and even better, because it contained a memorial <lb/>
            of his own acquittal, and the consequent establishment of his decree. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Reiske understands <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρχε</foreign>ȋ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ον</foreign>. Taylor translates it“ for the admiralty! <lb/>

            far as three ships and a tender; and let it be in the same <lb/>

            refused this compromise, and having been acquitted on the <lb/>
            indictment, but because my law was beneficial, and I have <lb/>
            proved it so by trial. For during the whole war, whilst the <lb/>
            armaments were shipped off according to my regulations, no <lb/>
            captain ever appealed to you3 against oppression, or took <lb/>
            sanctuary at Munychia,' or was imprisoned by the clearing­ <lb/>

            B.C. 379 was in force; so that a man possessing fifty talents would have <lb/>
            the charge of one ship, a hundred talents, of two ships, a hundred and <lb/>
            fifty talents, of three ships; and a tender would have to be found in <lb/>

            or left behind from unfitness to go to sea. Under the former <lb/>
            laws all these things happened-because the burden was put <lb/>
            upon the poor, and therefore difficulties frequently arose. <lb/>
            I transferred the charge from the poor to the wealthy, and <lb/>
            then every duty was done. For this itself too I deserve <lb/>
            praise, that I adopted all such measures as brought glory <lb/>

            worthy of Athens. The same character is apparent in my <lb/>
            home and in my foreign policy. At home, I never preferred <lb/>
            the favour of the wealthy to the rights of the many: abroad, <lb/>
            I valued not the presents or the friendship of Philip above <lb/>

            throughout been your friend and zealous in your service-is <lb/>
            proved abundantly, methinks, by what I have said already. <lb/>
            The most important part of my policy and administration I <lb/>
            pass by, considering that I have in regular course to reply to <lb/>
            the charge of illegality; and besides-though I am silent as <lb/>

            taken or advised; but for what I have voluntarily given to <lb/>
            the people out of my own private fortune, I deny that I am <lb/>
            any day accountable-do you hear, Æschines ? — nor is any <lb/>
            other man, let him even be one of the nine archons.1 For <lb/>
            what law is so full of injustice and inhumanity as to enact, <lb/>
            that one who has given of his private means, and done an act <lb/>
            of generosity and munificence, instead of having thanks, shall <lb/>
            be brought before malignants, appointed to be the auditors of <lb/>
            his liberality ? None. If he says there is let him produce it, <lb/>
            and I will be content and hold my tongue. But there is <lb/>
            none, men of Athens. The prosecutor in his malice, because <lb/>
            I gave some of my own money when I superintended the <lb/>
            theatre fund, says — “ the Council praised him before he had <lb/>
            rendered his account" Not for any matters of which I had <lb/>
            an account to render, but for what I spent of my own, you <lb/>
            malignant!</p>
          <p>“ Oh, but you were a Conservator of Walls !" says he. Yes; <lb/>
            and for that reason was I justly praised, because I gave the <lb/>
            sums expended and did not charge them. A charge requires <lb/>
            auditing and examiners; a donation merits thanks and praise ? <lb/>
            therefore the defendant made this motion in my favour.</p>
          <p>That this is a settled principle in your hearts as well as in <lb/>
            the laws, I can show by many proofs easily. First, Nausicles <lb/>
            has often been crowned by you for what he expended out of <lb/>
            his own funds whilst he was general. Secondly, Diotimus <lb/>
            was crowned for his present of shields; and Charidemus too. <lb/>
            Again, Neoptolemus here, superintendant of divers works, <lb/>
            has been honoured for his donations. It would indeed be <lb/>
            cruel, if a man holding an office should either, by reason of <lb/>
            his office, be precluded from giving his own money to the <lb/>
            state, or have, instead of receiving thanks, to render an ac­ <lb/>
            count of what he gave. To prove the truth of my statements, <lb/>

            noticed by Jacobs as unusual. Nausicles is frequently mentioned by <lb/>
            Æschines and Demosthenes in terms of praise. He commanded an <lb/>

            haps the Megarians, took the opportunity of invading Salamis. Reiske <lb/>

            The Charidemus here mentioned is not to be confounded with Chari­ <lb/>

            was demanded by Alexander after the taking of Thebes, and thereupon <lb/>
            fled to the court of Darius, by whom he was afterwards put to death. <lb/>
            (Diodorus, xvii. 30.) Diotimus also was one of the men demanded by <lb/>
            Alexander. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Such is the name which I give to the six junior archons, to avoid <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">φυρίζειν</foreign>, because at a certain bridge over the Cephisus, where the <lb/>

            Leland observes— “ The French translator is extremely shocked at this <lb/>

            accusation in this, that accusation has to do with offences for <lb/>
            which the laws provide penalties, abuse with the scandal <lb/>
            which enemies speak against each other according to their <lb/>

            offence which I committed, have obtained satisfaction for the <lb/>
            people according to the laws, you neglected it-at the audit, <lb/>
            on the indictments and other trials; but where I in my own <lb/>

            free state that I should ill-treat unfortunate citizens, and enter <lb/>
            houses without warrant,1 procured his release. And had not <lb/>

            your ill-timed error, made search after the man, seized and <lb/>
            brought him before you, a fellow like that would have been <lb/>
            rescued, would have slipped through the hands of justice, and <lb/>
            been sent out of the way by this declaimer. As it was, you <lb/>
            put him to torture and to death, as you ought this man <lb/>
            also. The Council of Areopagus were informed what Æschines <lb/>

            them full powers, they immediately removed him for his <lb/>
            treason, and appointed Hyperides to plead; for which pur­ <lb/>
            pose they took their ballots from the altars and not a single <lb/>

          <p>Antiphon (as it would appear) had been thus degraded from his rank <lb/>

            proceeding of Demosthenes a very arbitrary measure, <foreign xml:lang="grc">σφόδρα ἀριστο­ <lb/>

            together with an embassy from all his own allies, with the <lb/>
            intention of putting our commonwealth to shame, and prov­ <lb/>
            ing her in the wrong, then-when Python swaggered and <lb/>
            poured a flood of abuse3 upon you—I neither yielded nor <lb/>
            gave way; I rose and answered him, and betrayed not the <lb/>
            rights of the commonwealth. So plainly did I convict Philip <lb/>
            of injustice, that his very allies rose up and acknowledged it; <lb/>
            while AEschines fought his battle, and bore witness, aye, false <lb/>
            witness, against his own country.</p>
          <p>Nor was this enough. Again, some time afterwards, he <lb/>

            Apollo the Father-god1 of our state; and I implore them all ! <lb/>
            As I shall declare the truth to you, as I declared it in your <lb/>
            assembly at the time, the very moment I saw this wretch <lb/>
            putting his hand to the work-for I perceived, instantly per­ <lb/>
            ceived it-so may they grant me favour and protection ! If <lb/>
            from malice or personal rivalry I bring a false charge against <lb/>
            my opponent, may they cut me off from every blessing !</p>
          <p>But wherefore this imprecation, this solemn assurance f <lb/>
            Because, though I have documents lying in the public <lb/>
            archives, from which I shall clearly prove my assertions, <lb/>
            though I know you remember the facts, I fear this man may <lb/>
            be considered unequal to the mischiefs which he has wrought; <lb/>
            as before happened, when he caused the destruction of the <lb/>
            unhappy Phocians by his false reports to you.</p>
          <p>The Amphissian war,2 I say—which brought Philip to <lb/>
            Elatea, which caused him to be chosen general of the Am­ <lb/>
            phictyons, which ruined everything in Greece-was this <lb/>
            man's contrivance. He is the single author of all our heaviest <lb/>
            calamities. I protested at the time, and cried out in the <lb/>
            assembly—“ You are bringing a war, Æschines, into Attica, <lb/>
            an Amphictyonic war”—but his packed party3 would not <lb/>
            let me be heard; the rest wondered, and supposed that I was <lb/>
            bringing an idle charge against him out of personal enmity. <lb/>
            However, the real character of those transactions, the purpose <lb/>
            for which they were got up, the manner in which they were <lb/>
            accomplished, hear ye now, men of Athens, as ye were pre­ <lb/>
            vented then. You will see that the thing was well con­ <lb/>
            certed, and it will help you much to get a knowledge of <lb/>
            public affairs, and what craftiness there was in Philip you <lb/>
            will observe.</p>
          <p>Philip could neither finish nor get rid of the war with <lb/>
            Athens, unless he made the Thebans and Thessalians he <note type="footnote"> 1 So called, as being the father of Ion, the ancient king of <unclear>Athe</unclear> <lb/>

            fortune or skill, yet from the war itself and the cruisers he <lb/>
            suffered infinite damage. He could neither export any of <lb/>
            the produce of his country, nor import what he needed. He <lb/>
            was not then superior to you at sea, nor able to reach Attica, <lb/>
            unless the Thessalians followed him and the Thebans gave <lb/>
            him a passage; so that, while he overcame in war the generals <lb/>
            whom you sent out-such as they were—I say nothing about <lb/>
            that—he found himself distressed by the difference of your <lb/>
            local position and means.1 Should he urge either Thessalians <lb/>
            or Thebans to march in his own quarrel against you, none, he <lb/>
            thought, would attend to him : but should he, under the pre­ <lb/>
            tence of taking up their common cause, be elected general, he <lb/>
            trusted partly by deceit and partly by persuasion to gain his <lb/>
            ends more easily. 2 He sets to work therefore-observe how <lb/>
            cleverly-to get the Amphictyons into a war, and create a <lb/>
            disturbance in the congress. For this he thought they would <lb/>
            immediately want him. Now, if any of the presbyters com­ <lb/>
            missioned by himself or any of his allies brought it forward, <lb/>
            he imagined that both Thebans and Thessalians would suspect <lb/>
            the thing, and would all be on their guard; whereas, if the <lb/>
            agent were an Athenian and commissioned by you his oppo­ <lb/>
            nents, it would easily pass unnoticed. And thus it turned out.</p>
          <p>How did he effect his purpose I He hires the prosecutor. <lb/>
            No one (I believe) was aware of the thing or attending to it, <lb/>
            and so-just as these things are usually done at Athens— <lb/>
            Æschines was proposed for Pylæan deputy, three or four held <lb/>
            up their hands for him, and his election was declared. When <lb/>
            clothed with the dignity of the state he arrived among-the <lb/>
            Amphictyons, dismissing and disregarding all besides, be <lb/>
            hastened to execute what he was hired for. He makes up a <lb/>
            pretty speech and story, showing how the Cirrhæan plain <lb/>
            came to be consecrated; reciting this to the presbyters, men <lb/>

            procures a vote from them to walk round the district, which <lb/>
            the Amphissians maintained they had a right to cultivate <lb/>
            but which he charged to be parcel of the sacred plain. The <lb/>
            Locrians were not then instituting any suit against us, or an, <lb/>
            such proceeding as Æschines now falsely alleges.1 This will <lb/>
            show you—It was impossible (I fancy) for the Locrians to <lb/>
            carry on process against our commonwealth without a cita <lb/>
            tion. Who summoned us then ? In whose archonship ! Saj <lb/>
            who knows-point him out. You cannot. Your pretend <lb/>
            was flimsy and false.</p>
          <p>When the Amphictyons at the instance of this man walked <lb/>
            over the plain, the Locrians fell upon them and well-nigh <lb/>
            speared them all; some of the presbyters they carried of <lb/>
            captive. Complaints having followed, and war being stirred <lb/>
            up against the Amphissians, at first Cottyphus led an armj <lb/>
            composed entirely of Amphictyons; but as some never came, <lb/>
            and those that came did nothing, measures were taken agains <lb/>
            the ensuing congress by an instructed gang, the old traitors <lb/>
            of Thessaly and other states, to get the command for Philip. <lb/>
            And they had found a fair pretext: for it was necessary, they <lb/>
            said, either to subsidise themselves and maintain a mercenary <lb/>
            force and fine all recusants, or to elect him. What need of <lb/>
            many words? He was thereupon chosen general; and im <lb/>
            mediately afterwards collecting an army, and marching <lb/>
            professedly against Cirrha, he bids a long farewell to the <lb/>
            Cirrhæans and Locrians, and seizes Elatea. Had not th&lt; <lb/>
            Thebans, upon seeing this, immediately changed their mind <lb/>
            and sided with us, the whole thing would have fallen like a <lb/>
            torrent upon our country. As it was, they for the instant <lb/>

            one man has inflicted these calamities on Greece. Heaven <lb/>
            and earth ! It was not a single man, but a number of mis­ <lb/>
            creants in every state. Æschines was one of them; and, <lb/>
            were I obliged to speak the truth without reserve, I should <lb/>
            not hesitate to call him the common pest1 of all that have <lb/>
            since been ruined, men, places, cities: for whoever supplies <lb/>
            the seed, to him the crop is owing. I marvel indeed, you <lb/>
            turned not your faces away the moment you beheld him. <lb/>
            But there is a thick darkness, it seems, between you and the <lb/>
            truth.</p>
          <p>The mention of this man's treasonable acts brings me to <lb/>
            the part which I have myself taken in opposition to him. It <lb/>
            is fair you should hear my account of it for many reasons, <lb/>
            but chiefly, men of Athens, because it would be a shame, <lb/>
            when I have undergone the toil of exertions on your behalf, <lb/>
            that you should not endure the bare recital of them.</p>
          <p>When I saw that the Thebans, and I may add the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians, were so led away by Philip's partisans and the corrupt <lb/>
            men of either state, as to disregard and take no precaution <lb/>
            against a danger which menaced both, and required the <lb/>
            utmost precaution, (I mean the suffering Philip's power to <lb/>
            increase,) and were readily disposed to enmity and strife with <lb/>
            each other; I was constantly watchful to prevent it, not only <lb/>
            because in my own judgment I deemed such vigilance expe­ <lb/>
            dient, but knowing that Aristophon, and again Eubulus, had <lb/>
            all along desired to bring about that union, and, whilst they <lb/>
            were frequently opposed upon other matters, were always <lb/>
            agreed upon this. Men whom in their lifetime—you reptile! <lb/>
            —you pestered with flattery, yet see not that you are <lb/>
            accusing them in their graves :2 for the Theban policy that <note type="footnote"> owe them entirely to a single person." From this it appears that he <lb/>
            understood <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑφ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑνὸς</foreign> to mean Æschines. I agree with those interpreters <lb/>
            who understand it of Philip. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Compare Virgil, AEneid II. 573 : <lb/>

            them, who approved that alliance before I did. But I must <lb/>
            return.—I say, when Æschines had excited the war in <lb/>
            Amphissa, and his coadjutors had helped to establish enmity <lb/>
            with Thebes, Philip marched against us—that was the object <lb/>

            not roused up a little in time, we could never have recovered <lb/>
            ourselves: so far had these men carried matters. In what <lb/>

          <p>Philip having thus disposed the states towards each other <lb/>
            by his contrivances, and being elated by these decrees and <lb/>
            answers, came with his army and seized Elatea, confident <lb/>
            that, happen what might, you and the Thebans could never <lb/>
            again unite. What commotion there was in the city you <lb/>
            all know; but let me just mention the most striking cir­ <lb/>
            cumstances.</p>
          <p>It was evening. A person came with a message to the <lb/>
            presidents, that Elatea was taken. They rose from supper <lb/>
            immediately, drove off the people from their market-stalls, <lb/>
            and set fire to the wicker-frames; 1 others sent for the <lb/>
            generals and called the trumpeter; and the city was full of <lb/>
            commotion. The next morning at daybreak the presidents <lb/>
            summoned the council to their hall, and you went to the <lb/>
            assembly, and before they could introduce or prepare the <lb/>
            question,2 the whole people were up in their seats.3 When <lb/>
            the council had entered, and the presidents had reported <lb/>
            their intelligence and presented the courier, and he had <lb/>
            made his statement, the crier asked—“ Who wishes to <lb/>
            speak ?”—and no one came forward. The crier put the <note type="footnote"> 1 Reiske thinks the object of this proceeding was to clear the ground <lb/>
            of the market, that the people might be stationed there in arms during <lb/>
            the night. Leland says it was “ to clear the place for an assembly, and <lb/>
            in their confusion and impatience they took the speediest and most <lb/>
            violent method." But the assembly was held in the Pnyx, and not in <lb/>
            the market. Another writer has conjectured that the presidents meant <lb/>
            to force the citizens to attend to public business. Schaefer's is the more <lb/>
            probable explanation, that the stalls were burned for a fire-signal, to <lb/>
            bring the people from the rural districts into the city. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 According to the usual course of law, the council prepared and <lb/>
            drew up some formal question or bill to be submitted to the people. <lb/>
            This was the <foreign xml:lang="grc">προβούλευμα</foreign>. In the present case, being a special meeting <lb/>
            on a sudden emergency, they would probably draw up nothing more <lb/>
            than the heads of a question, to be afterwards put in the shape of a <lb/>
            decree if necessary. Jacobs translates these words: ehe der Senat noch <lb/>
            sein Geschäft vollbracht und einen vorläufigen Beschluss gefasst hatte. <lb/>
            Pabst: ehe noch der Senat seine Verhandlungen beendiyt und ein Gut­ <lb/>

            question repeatedly-still no man rose, though all the gene­ <lb/>
            rals were present and all the orators, and our country with <lb/>
            her common voice called for some one to speak and save her <lb/>
            -for when the crier raises his voice according to law, it may <lb/>
            justly be deemed the common voice of our country. If those <lb/>
            who desired the salvation of Athens were the proper parties <lb/>
            to come forward, all of you and the other Athenians would <lb/>
            have risen and mounted the platform; for I am sure you all <lb/>
            desired her salvation-if those of greatest wealth, the three- <lb/>
            hundred 1—if those who were both, friendly to the state and <lb/>
            wealthy, the men who afterwards gave such ample donations; <lb/>
            for patriotism and wealth produced the gift. But that occa­ <lb/>
            sion, that day, as it seems, called not only for a patriot and a <lb/>
            wealthy man, but for one who had closely followed the pro­ <lb/>
            ceedings from their commencement, and rightly calculated <lb/>
            for what object and purpose Philip carried them on. A man <lb/>
            who was ignorant of these matters, or had not long and care­ <lb/>
            fully studied them, let him be ever so patriotic or wealthy, <lb/>
            would neither see what measures were needful, nor be com­ <lb/>
            petent to advise you.</p>
          <p>Well then—I was the man called for upon that day. I <lb/>
            came forward. and addressed you. What I said, I beg you for <lb/>
            two reasons attentively to hear- first, to be convinced, that of <lb/>
            all your orators and statesmen I alone deserted not the <lb/>
            patriot's post' in the hour of danger, but was found in the <lb/>
            very moment of panic speaking and moving what your neces­ <lb/>
            sities required-secondly, because at the expense of a little <lb/>
            time you will gain large experience for the future in all your <lb/>
            political concerns.3</p>
          <p>I said-those who were in such alarm under the idea that <lb/>
            Philip had got the Thebans with him did not, in my opinion, <note type="footnote"> 1 See vol. I. pp. 52, 801. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Auger has the following note, whether fanciful or not, I leave to the <lb/>

            for the future." Leland and Spillan refer it wrongly to the political <lb/>
            actions of Demosthenes. </note> <lb/>

            understand the position of affairs; for I was sure, had that <lb/>
            really been so, we should have heard not of his being at <lb/>
            Elatea, but upon our frontiers: he was come however, I knew <lb/>
            for certain, to make all right for himself in Thebes. " Let <lb/>
            me inform you," said I, " how the matter stands.-All the <lb/>
            Thebans whom it was possible either to bribe or deceive he <lb/>
            has at his command; 1 those who have resisted him from the <lb/>
            first and still oppose him he can in no way prevail upon:; <lb/>
            what then is his meaning, and why has he seized upon <lb/>
            Elatea ? He means, by displaying a force in the neighbour­ <lb/>
            hood, and bringing up his troops, to encourage and embolden <lb/>
            his friends, to intimidate his adversaries, that they may either <lb/>
            concede from fear what they now refuse, or be compelled. <lb/>
            Now "-said I—“ if we determine on the present occasion to <lb/>
            remember any unkindness which the Thebans have done us, <lb/>
            and to regard them in the character of enemies with distrust, <lb/>
            in the first place, we shall be doing just what Philip would <lb/>
            desire; in the next place, I fear, his present adversaries em­ <lb/>
            bracing his friendship and all Philippising with one consent, <lb/>
            they will both march against Attica. But if you will hearken' <lb/>
            to me, aud be pleased to examine (not cavil at) what I say, I <lb/>
            believe it will meet your approval, and I shall dispel the <lb/>
            danger impending over Athens. What then do I advise ?— <lb/>
            First, away with your present fear; and rather fear all of ye <lb/>
            for the Thebans—they are nearer harm than we are-to them <lb/>
            the peril is more immediate :-next I say, march to Eleusis, <lb/>
            all the fighting-men and the cavalry, and show yourselves to <lb/>
            the world in arms, that your partisans in Thebes may have <lb/>
            equal liberty to speak up for the good cause, knowing that, as <lb/>
            the faction who sell their country to Philip have an army to <lb/>
            support them at Elatea, so the party that will contend for <lb/>
            freedom have your assistance at hand if they are assailed. <lb/>
            Further I recommend you to elect ten ambassadors, and em­ <lb/>
            power them in conjunction with the generals to fix the time <lb/>
            for going there and for the out-march. When the ambas­ <lb/>
            sadors have arrived at Thebes, how do I advise that you should <lb/>
            treat the matter? Pray attend particularly to this—Ask <lb/>
            nothing of the Thebans; (it would be dishonourable at this <lb/>
            time;) but offer to assist them if they require it, on the plea <note type="footnote"> 1 So Lord Brougham, whom I have followed; and so Jacobs ex­ <lb/>
            presses it: hat er alle in seiner Gewalt. </note> <lb/>

            that they are in extreme danger, and we see the future better <lb/>
            than they do. If they accept this offer and hearken to our <lb/>
            counsels, so shall we have accomplished what we desire, and <lb/>
            our conduct will look 1 worthy of the state: should we mis­ <lb/>
            carry, they will have themselves to blame for any error com­ <lb/>
            mitted now, and we shall have done nothing dishonourable or <lb/>
            mean."</p>
          <p>This and more to the like effect I spoke, and left the <lb/>
            platform. It was approved by all; not a word was said <lb/>
            against me. Nor did I make the speech without moving, nor <lb/>
            make the motion without undertaking the embassy, nor un­ <lb/>
            dertake the embassy without prevailing on the Thebans.2 <lb/>
            From the beginning to the end I went through it all; I gave <lb/>
            myself entirely to your service, to meet the dangers which <lb/>
            encompassed Athens.</p>
          <p>Produce me the decree which then passed. Now, Æschines, I <lb/>

          <p>“ In the archonship of Nausicles,2 in the presidency of the <lb/>
            Æantian tribe, on the sixteenth of Scirophorion, Demosthenes <lb/>
            son of Demosthenes of Pæania moved : Whereas Philip king <lb/>
            of Macedon hath in time past been violating the treaty of <lb/>
            peace made between him and the Athenian people, in con­ <lb/>
            tempt of his oaths and those laws of justice which are recog­ <lb/>
            nised among all the Greeks, and hath been annexing unto <lb/>
            himself cities that no way belong to him, and hath besieged <lb/>
            and taken some which belong to the Athenians without any <lb/>
            provocation by the people of Athens, and at the present <lb/>
            time he is making great advances in cruelty and violence, <lb/>
            forasmuch as in certain Greek cities he puts garrisons and <lb/>
            overturns their constitution, some he razes to the ground <lb/>
            and sells the inhabitants for slaves, in some he replaces a <lb/>
            Greek population with barbarians, giving them possession of <lb/>
            the temples and sepulchres, acting in no way foreign to his <lb/>
            own country or character, making an insolent use of his <lb/>
            present fortune, and forgetting that from a petty and insigni­ <lb/>
            fioant person he has come to be unexpectedly great: and the <lb/>
            people of Athens, so long as they saw him annexing barbarian <lb/>
            or private cities of their own,3 less seriously regarded the <note type="footnote"> 1 Cresphontes, king of Messenia, and one of the Heraclidæ, was the <lb/>
            hero of a lost play of Euripides; Creon is the well known character in <lb/>
            the (Edipus and Antigone of Sophocles: (Enomaus, the king of Elis, <lb/>
            and father of Hippodamia, was the hero of a tragedy of Ischander, in <lb/>

            one of the Attic townships. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The archon was Lysimachides. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Jacobs: dass er nur barbarische, wenn gleich ihm angehörige Städte <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰδίας</foreign>, as I have done. Schaefer thus comments on the passage: “ Scilicet <lb/>
            totius psephismatis hæc vis, hie tenor est, ut Athenienses arms, sumere <lb/>

            offence given to themselves, but now that they see Greek <lb/>
            cities outraged and some destroyed, they think it would be <lb/>
            monstrous and unworthy of their ancestral glory to look on <lb/>
            while the Greeks are enslaved: Therefore it is resolved by the <lb/>
            Council and People of Athens, that having prayed and sacri­ <lb/>
            ficed to the gods and heroes who protect the Athenian city <lb/>
            and territory, bearing in mind the virtue of their ancestors, <lb/>
            who deemed it of greater moment to preserve the liberty of <lb/>
            Greece than their own country, they will put two hundred <lb/>
            ships to sea, and their admiral shall sail up into the <lb/>
            straits of Thermopylae, and their general and commander of <lb/>
            horse shall march with the infantry and cavalry to Eleusis, <lb/>
            and ambassadors shall be sent to the other Greeks, and first <lb/>
            of all to the Thebans, because Philip is nearest their territory, <lb/>
            and shall exhort them without dread of Philip to maintain <lb/>
            their own independence and that of Greece at large, and <lb/>
            assure them that the Athenian people, not remembering any <lb/>
            variance which has formerly arisen between the countries, <lb/>
            will assist them with troops and money and weapons and <lb/>
            arms, feeling that for them (being Greeks) to contend among <lb/>
            themselves for the leadership is honourable, but to be com­ <lb/>
            manded and deprived of the leadership by a man of foreign <lb/>
            extraction is derogatory to the renown of the Greeks and the <lb/>
            virtue of their ancestors: further, the people of Athens do <lb/>
            not regard the people of Thebes as aliens either in blood or <lb/>
            race; they remember also the benefits conferred by their <lb/>
            ancestors upon the ancestors of the Thebans; for they re­ <lb/>
            stored the children of Hercules who were kept by the Pelo­ <lb/>
            ponnesians out of their hereditary dominion, defeating in <lb/>
            battle those who attempted to resist the descendants of Her­ <lb/>
            cules ; and we gave shelter to CEdipus and his comrades in <lb/>
            exile; and many other kind and generous acts have been <lb/>
            done by us to the Thebans : wherefore now also the people of <lb/>
            Athens will not desert the interests of the Thebans and the <lb/>
            other Greeks: And let a treaty be entered into with them for <lb/>
            alliance and intermarriage, and oaths be mutually exchanged. <lb/>
            Ambassadors: Demosthenes son of Demosthenes of Pæania, <lb/>
            Hyperides son of Oleander of Spettus, Mnesithides son of <lb/>
            Antiphanes of Phrearrii, Democrates son of Sophilus of <lb/>

          <p>That was the commencement and first step in the negotia­ <lb/>
             <pb n="74"/>
            tion with Thebes:1 before then the countries had been led by <lb/>
            these men into discord and hatred and jealousy. That decree <lb/>
            caused the peril which then surrounded us to pass away like <lb/>
            a cloud. It was the duty of a good citizen, if he had any <lb/>
            better plan, to disclose it at the time, not to find fault now. <lb/>
            A statesman and a pettifogger,2 while in no other respect are <lb/>
            they alike, in this most widely differ. The one declares his <lb/>
            opinion before the proceedings, and makes himself responsible <lb/>
            to his followers, to fortune, to the times, to all men : the <lb/>
            other is silent when he ought to speak; at any untoward <lb/>
            event he grumbles. Now, as I said before, the time for a <lb/>
            man who regarded the commonwealth, and for honest coun­ <lb/>
            sel, was then: however I will go to this extent3—if any one <lb/>
            now can point out a better course, or indeed if any other was <lb/>
            practicable but the one which I adopted, I confess that I was <lb/>
            wrong. For if there be any measure now discovered, which <lb/>
            (executed then) would have been to our advantage, I say it <note type="footnote"> 1 Jacobs: Dies tear der Anfang und das erste Verfahren in der <lb/>

            der in den Angelegenheiten der Thebaner gethan wurde. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Lord Brougham, objecting to Leland's translation of “sycophant,” <lb/>
            says, "he might as well call a player a ‘hypocrite,’ or a peasant a <lb/>
            ‘ villain.'" This criticism I assent to; yet it is not easy to find an apt <lb/>
            word for <foreign xml:lang="grc">συκοφάντης</foreign>, and hence the German translators, as well as some <lb/>
            of the English, have retained the Greek term. It has various modifi­ <lb/>
            cations of meaning in the Orators, all having reference, more or less <lb/>
            remote, to the original meaning of an " informer." (See my article <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Συκοφάντης</foreign> in the Archaeological Dictionary, where this is fully ex­ <lb/>
            plained.) It may often be rendered " a slanderer," and so Auger renders <lb/>
            it here, “calomniateur." Sometimes it denotes a " vexatious meddler.­ <lb/>
            a " malignant and sneaking enemy.” Thus Demosthenes says, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πονηρὸν</foreign> <lb/>
            6 <foreign xml:lang="grc">συκοφάντης καὶ βάσκανον</foreign> And again, <foreign xml:lang="grc">συκοφάντης τοῦτ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔστιν, αἰτιᾶσθαι <lb/>
            πάντα, ἐξελέγχειν δὲ μηδέν</foreign>.And (as we have seen) Æschines says it <lb/>
            was a common name for all scoundrels. </note><note type="footnote"> As contrasted with <foreign xml:lang="grc">σύμβουλος</foreign>, an honest adviser or statesman, It <lb/>
            signifies a factious politician, one who seeks his own interest or that <lb/>
            of his party, or the gratification of private malice, rather than the good <lb/>
            of his country; one capable of doing the things which Demosthenes <lb/>
            charges his adversary with. Such a person may be called a pettifogger <lb/>
            in politics, just as a dirty practitioner is called a pettifogger in the law. <lb/>
            The version, I must admit, is not perfectly satisfactory, yet it seems <lb/>
            preferable to any other single word. Lord Brougham's “partisan” Is <lb/>
            too weak. If I chose to use two words, I would say " an honest politicA <lb/>
            and a factious one," &amp;c. </note><note type="footnote"> * “ I will go to this extreme length in making concession." Or as <lb/>
            Lord Brougham has it: "I will go to such an excess of candour.” </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="75"/>
            ought not to have escaped me. But if there is none, if there <lb/>
            was none, if none can be suggested even at this day, what was <lb/>
            a statesman to do ? Was he not to choose the best measures <lb/>
            within his reach and view ? That did I, AEschines, when the <lb/>
            crter asked, " Who wishes to speak?”—not, " Who wishes to <lb/>
            complain about the past, or to guarantee the future ?” Whilst <lb/>
            you on those occasions sat mute in the assembly, I came <lb/>
            forward and spake. However, as you omitted then, tell us <lb/>
            now. Say, what scheme that I ought to have devised, what <lb/>
            favourable opportunity was lost to the state by my neglect ?— <lb/>
            what alliance was there, what better plan, to which I should <lb/>
            have directed the people ? But no! The past is with all the <lb/>
            world given up; no one even proposes to deliberate about <lb/>
            it: the future it is, or the present, which demands the action <lb/>
            of a counsellor. At the time, as it appeared, there were <lb/>
            dangers impending, and dangers at hand. Mark the line of <lb/>
            my policy at that crisis ; don't rail at the event. The end <lb/>
            of all things is what the Deity pleases: his line of policy it is <lb/>
            that shows the judgment of the statesman. Do not then <lb/>
            impute it as a crime to me that Philip chanced to conquer in <lb/>
            battle : that issue depended not on me, but <unclear>a</unclear>-God. Prove <lb/>
            that I adopted not all measures that according to human cal­ <lb/>
            culation were feasible-that I did not honestly and diligently <lb/>
            and with exertions beyond my strength carry them out-or <lb/>
            that my enterprises were not honourable and worthy of the <lb/>
            state and necessary. Show me this, and accuse me as soon <lb/>
            as you like. But if the hurricane that visited us bath been <lb/>
            too powerful, not for us only, but for all Greece besides, what <lb/>
            is the fair course ?1 As if a merchant, after taking every pre­ <lb/>
            caution, and furnishing his vessel with everything that he <lb/>
            thought would ensure her safety, because afterwards he met <lb/>
            with a storm and his tackle was strained or broken to pieces, <note type="footnote"> 1The Orator, as Schaefer rightly observes, suppresses the answer to <lb/>
            his own question, which, if fully expressed, would be as follows:— The <lb/>
            fair thing is, not to blame me for events which were inevitable. You <lb/>
            might as well blame a shipowner," &amp;c. Leland saw the true meaning, <lb/>
            and expresses it in his translation: " What then ? Am I to be accused ? <lb/>
            With equal justice might the trader," &amp;c. And thus Auger: " Que faire, <lb/>

            have read <foreign xml:lang="grc">χρῆν</foreign> apparently, and misconceived the sense of the passage. <lb/>
            I have thought it better to preserve the looseness of the original, which <lb/>

          <p>Consider and reflect upon this--If, with the Thebans on <lb/>
            our side, we were destined so to fare in the contest, what was <lb/>
            to be expected, if we had never had them for allies, but they <lb/>
            had joined Philip, as he used every effort of persuasion to <lb/>
            make them do ?1 And if, when the battle was fought three <lb/>
            days march from Attica, such peril and alarm surrounded <lb/>
            the city, what must we have expected, if the same disaster <lb/>
            had happened in some part of our territory ? As it was, (do <lb/>
            you see ?) we could stand, meet, breathe; mightily did one, <lb/>
            two, three days, help to our preservation:2 in the other case <lb/>
            -but it is wrong to mention things, of which we have been <lb/>
            spared the trial by the favour of some deity, and by our pro­ <lb/>

          <p>All this, at such length, have I addressed to you, men of <lb/>
            the jury, and to the outer circle of hearers; for, as to this <lb/>
            contemptible fellow, a short and plain argument would suffice.</p>
          <p>If the future was revealed to you, Æschines, alone, when <lb/>

            take <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκεῖνος</foreign> to mean AEschines. The writer of an article in the Edin­ <lb/>

            Williams, has the following note :—“ If <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκῖνος</foreign> be the true reading, we <lb/>
            are aware that Philip must be meant. But the spirit of the passage <lb/>
            itself, and the analogy of the whole oration, lean to <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὗτος</foreign>, as we trans­ <lb/>
            late it." I cannot assent to this criticism. The orator wishes to impress <lb/>
            upon his hearers the great importance which Philip attached to the <lb/>
            alliance of Thebes. He does not mean to charge Æschines with openly <lb/>
            advocating Philip's cause: on the contrary, he represents Æschines <lb/>
            as having then held his tongue. Leland saw the true meaning. His <lb/>
            version is: "but united with our enemy in compliance with all his <lb/>
            urgent solicitations." So did Auger, whom the Edinburgh reviewer <lb/>
            calls " a babbling, cackling Frenchman.” His version is: " ce prince <lb/>

            basest person and worst enemy of the state would do, are you <lb/>
            found to have done after the event; and at the same time <lb/>
            Aristratus in Naxos and Aristolaus in Thasos, the deadly foes <lb/>
            of our state, are bringing to trial the friends of Athens, and <lb/>
            AEschines at Athens is accusing Demosthenes. Surely the <lb/>
            man, who waited to found his reputation upon the misfor­ <lb/>
            tunes of the Greeks,1 deserves rather to perish than to accuse <lb/>
            another; nor is it possible that one, who has profited by the <lb/>
            same conjunctures as the enemies of the commonwealth, can <lb/>
            be a well-wisher of his country. You show yourself by your <lb/>
            life and conduct, by your political action, and even your <lb/>
            political inaction.' Is anything going on that appears good <lb/>
            for the people ? Æschines is mute. Has anything untoward <lb/>
            happened or amiss? Forth comes Æschines; just as fractures <lb/>
            and sprains are put in motion, when the body is attacked <lb/>
            with disease.</p>
          <p>But since he insists so strongly on the event, I will even <lb/>
            assert something of a paradox: and I beg and pray of you <lb/>
            not to marvel at its boldness, but kindly to consider what I <lb/>
            say. If then the results had been foreknown to all, if all <lb/>
            had foreseen them, and you, Æschines, had foretold them and <lb/>
            protested with clamour and outcry—you that never opened <lb/>
            your mouth-not even then should the Commonwealth have <lb/>
            abandoned her design, if she had any regard for glory, or <lb/>
            ancestry, or futurity. As it is, she appears to have failed in <note type="footnote"> 1 laterally: “ for whom the misfortunes of the Greeks were kept in <lb/>

            and afterwards abandoning her pretensions—she would have <lb/>
            incurred the charge of betraying all to Philip. Why, had we <lb/>
            resigned without a struggle that which our ancestors en­ <lb/>
            countered every danger to win, who would not have spit <lb/>

            had been chosen leader and lord of all, but other people <lb/>

            when in former times our country had never preferred an igno­ <lb/>

            pleased and hold her own, provided she would accept foreign <lb/>
            law and let another power -Command in Greece? But, as it <lb/>
            seems, to the Athenians of that day such conduct would not <lb/>
            have been national, or natural, or endurable : none could at <lb/>
            any period of time persuade the commonwealth to attach <lb/>

            ancestors you honour most those who acted in such a spirit; <lb/>
            and with reason. For who would not admire the virtue of <lb/>

            quitted country and home, rather than receive foreign law, <lb/>
            choosing Themistocles who gave such counsel for their general, <lb/>
            and stoning Cyrsilus to death who advised submission to the <lb/>
            terms imposed-not him only, but your wives also stoning <lb/>
            his wife?1 Yes; the Athenians of that day looked not for <lb/>
            an orator or a general, who might help them to a pleasant <lb/>
            servitude: they scorned to live, if it could not be with <lb/>
            freedom. For each of them considered, that he was not <lb/>
            born to his father or mother only, but also to his country.2 <lb/>
            What is the difference? He that thinks himself born for <lb/>
            his parents only, waits for his appointed or natural end : he <lb/>
            that thinks himself born for his country also, will sooner <lb/>
            perish than behold her in slavery, and will regard the insults <lb/>
            and indignities, which must be borne in a commonwealth <lb/>

            instant in the midst of this inflammation. The sentence containing <lb/>
            the apostrophe is not closed, before we find it recurring; and in such <lb/>
            a shape as induces us to suppose, that for its sake the oratory is intro­ <lb/>

            the compacts of every-day life you are to judge of by par­ <lb/>
            ticular laws and circumstances; the measures of statesmen, <lb/>
            by reference to the dignity of your ancestors. And if you <lb/>
            think it your duty to act worthily of them, you should every <lb/>
            one of you consider, when you come into court to decide <lb/>
            public questions, that together with your staff and ticket1 the <lb/>
            spirit of the commonwealth is delivered to you.</p>
          <p>But in touching upon the deeds of your ancestors, there <lb/>
            were some decrees and transactions which I omitted. I will <lb/>
            return from my digression.</p>
          <p>On our arrival at Thebes, we found ambassadors there from <lb/>
            Philip, from the Thessalians and from his other allies; our <lb/>
            friends in trepidation, his friends confident. To prove that <lb/>
            I am not asserting this now to serve my own purposes, read <lb/>
            me the letter which we ambassadors despatched on the in­ <lb/>
            stant. So outrageous is my opponent's malignity, that, if any <lb/>
            advantage was procured, he attributes it to the occasion, not <note type="footnote"> plaintiff, or defendant, (who were always in court,) or to their respec­ <lb/>
            tive friends and supporters who stood near them, or to the jury or <lb/>
            surrounding spectators, designates them simply as <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἷτος</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὗτοι</foreign>, and <lb/>
            is easily understood by his hearers. But in a translation for English <lb/>
            readers, these terms require to be varied according to circumstances. <lb/>
            Jacobs here has: Sollt’ ich sagen was der Stadt unwürdig war ? </note><note type="footnote"> 1 There were 6000 jurors chosen by lot for the service of the year, <lb/>
            600 from each of the Attic tribes. The whole number was then divided <lb/>
            into ten sections of 500 each, a thousand being left as supernumeraries, <lb/>
            to supply deficiencies occasioned by death or any other cause. There <lb/>
            were ten courts at Athens, among which the services of these <unclear>jurors</unclear> <lb/>
            were to be distributed; and it was managed in the following way. Each <lb/>
            court was designated by a colour, and also by a letter over the doorway. <lb/>
            Each of the jury sections was likewise designated by a letter. When <lb/>
            the juries had to be impanelled, the letters indicating the different <lb/>
            sections were drawn out of one box, and the letters indicating the dif­ <lb/>
            ferent courts were drawn out of another: each pair of lots so drawn <lb/>
            out determined what section should be assigned to what court. When <lb/>
            the whole section was not required, the individual jurors who were to <lb/>
            form the panel were chosen by lot, each <unclear>iuhhaving</unclear> a counter with <lb/>
            his section and name marked upon it. The <unclear>rts</unclear> being thus allotted, <lb/>
            every juryman received a staft and a ticket. The staff, on which was <lb/>
            marked the letter and colour of his court, served to distinguish him <lb/>
            from the crowd, and procure him instant admission. The ticket, which <lb/>
            he returned to the magistrate when the business was concluded, entitled <lb/>
            him to his fee. </note> <note type="footnote">VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> G </note> <lb/>

            fortune. And according to him, as it seems, I, the orator and <lb/>
            adviser, have no merit in results of argument and counsel, <lb/>
            but am the sole author of misfortunes in arms and strategy. <lb/>

          <p>On the convening of the assembly, our opponents were <lb/>
            introduced first, because they held the character of allies. <lb/>
            And they came forward and spoke, in high praise of Philip <lb/>
            and disparagement of you, bringing up all the hostilities that <lb/>
            you ever committed against the Thebans. In fine, they <lb/>
            urged them to show their gratitude for the services done by <lb/>
            Philip, and to avenge themselves for the injuries which you <lb/>
            had done them, either-it mattered not which-by giving <lb/>
            them a passage against you, or by joining in the invasion of <lb/>
            Attica; and they proved, as they fancied, that by adopting <lb/>
            their advice the cattle and slaves and other effects of Attica <lb/>
            would come into Bœotia, whereas by acting as they said we <lb/>
            should advise Bceotia would suffer pillage through the war. <lb/>
            And much they said besides, tending all to the same point. <lb/>
            The reply that we made I would give my life to recapitulate, <lb/>
            but I fear, as the occasion is past, you will look upon it as if <lb/>
            a sort of deluge had overwhelmed the whole proceedings, and <lb/>
            regard any talk about them as a useless troubling of you.' <lb/>
            Hear then what we persuaded them and what answer they <lb/>
            returned. Take and read this:</p>

            their succour, and-to omit what happened between-their <lb/>
            reception of you was so friendly, that, while their infantry <lb/>
            and cavalry were outside the walls, they admitted your army <lb/>
            into their houses and citadel, among their wives and children <lb/>
            and all that was most precious. Why, upon that day three <lb/>

            preferred fighting on your side to fighting against you, they <lb/>
            held you to be braver and juster in your demands than <lb/>
            Philip ; and when they put under your charge what they and <lb/>

            forth eulogies from other men to you, sacrifice and thanks­ <lb/>
            giving from you to the Gods. And I would gladly ask <lb/>
            Æschmes—while these things were going on, and the city <lb/>
            was full of enthusiasm and joy and praise, whether he joined <lb/>
            with the multitude in sacrifice and festivity, or sat at home <lb/>
            sorrowing and moaning and repining at the public success. <lb/>
            For if he was present and appeared with the rest, is not his <lb/>
            conduct monstrous, or rather impious, when measures, which <lb/>
            he himself called the Gods to witness were excellent, he now <lb/>
            requires you to condemn—you that have sworn by the Gods? <lb/>
            If he was not present, does he not deserve a thousand deaths <lb/>

          <p>Athenians, you have had many great and renowned orators <lb/>
            before me; the famous Callistratus, Aristophon, Cephalus, <lb/>
            Thrasybulus, hundreds of others; yet none of them ever <lb/>
            thoroughly devoted himself to any measure of state: for <lb/>
            instance, the mover of a resolution would not be ambassador; <lb/>
            the ambassador would not move a resolution ; each one left <lb/>
            for himself some relief, and also, should anything happen, an <lb/>
            excuse.1 How then-it may be said-did you so far surpass <lb/>
            others in might and boldness as to do everything yourself? <lb/>
            I don't say that: but such was my conviction of the danger <lb/>
            impending over us, that I considered it left no room or <lb/>
            thought for individual security; a man should have been <lb/>
            only too happy to perform his duty without neglect. 2 As to <note type="footnote"> the second alternative-the second horn—and it never could have <lb/>

            measures, but their wickedness; not grudging the people their short- <lb/>

            This answer was complete. Nevertheless, there are but very few com­ <lb/>
            plete dilemmas in the whole course of any argument upon any subject; <lb/>
            and the one under consideration is quite good enough to pass with an <lb/>

            myself I was persuaded, perhaps foolishly, yet I was per­ <lb/>

            none would execute them better, none as ambassador would <lb/>

          <p>To this did my policy, Æschines, reduce Philip. This lan­ <lb/>
            guage he uttered through me, he that before had lifted his <lb/>
            voice so boldly against Athens! For which I was justly <lb/>
            crowned by the people; and you were present and opposed it <lb/>
            not, and Diondas who preferred an indictment obtained not <lb/>
            his share of the votes. Here, read me the decrees which were <lb/>
            then absolved, and which this man never indicted.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The decrees.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>These decrees, men of Athens, contain the very words and <lb/>
            syllables, which Aristonicus drew up formerly, and Ctesiphon <lb/>
            the defendant has now. And Æschines neither arraigned <lb/>
            these himself, nor aided the party who preferred an indict­ <lb/>
            ment. Yet, if his present charge against me be true, he <lb/>
            might then have <unclear>arraign</unclear> momeles the mover and He­ <lb/>
            rides with more <unclear>show</unclear> than he can the defendant. <lb/>
            Why? Because <unclear>Ctesiphay</unclear> refer to them, and to the <lb/>
            decisions of the courts, and to the fact of Æschines not <lb/>
            having accused them, although they moved the same decrees <lb/>
            which he has now, and to the laws which bar any further <lb/>
            proceedings in such a case, and to many points besides:— <lb/>
            whereas then the question would have been tried on its own <lb/>
            merits, before any such advantages had been obtained.2 But <lb/>
            then, I imagine, it would have been impossible to do what <note type="footnote"> quia, nullâ non curâ, adhibitâ, sorte fatali nteretur." And so Jacobs : <lb/>

            assent to this interpretation, which would give too emphatic a sense to <lb/>
            the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">μηδὲν παραλείπων</foreign>. As I take it, they refer to a <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεῖ</foreign>, so that <lb/>
            we understand <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῶν δεόντων</foreign> after <foreign xml:lang="grc">μηδέν</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Spillan has it literally: "concerning matters thus transacted." <lb/>
            Brougham : " for things so settled." Pabst: gegen das, was schon also <lb/>

            Æschines now does-to pick out of a multitude of old dates <lb/>
            and decrees what no roan knew before, and what no man <lb/>
            would have expected to hear to-day, for the purpose of <lb/>
            slander-to transpose dates, and assign measures to the <lb/>
            wrong causes instead of the right, in order to make a plausible <lb/>
            case. That was impossible then. Every statement must have <lb/>
            been according to the truth, soon after the facts, while you <lb/>
            still remembered the particulars and had them almost at <lb/>
            your fingers' ends. Therefore it was that he shunned all <lb/>
            investigation at the time, and has come at this late period; <lb/>
            thinking, as it appears to me, that you would make it a con­ <lb/>
            test of orators, instead of an inquiry into political conduct; <lb/>
            that words would be criticised, and not interests of state.</p>
          <p>Then he plays the sophist,1 and says, you ought to dis­ <lb/>
            regard the opinion of us which you came from home with­ <lb/>
            that, as when you audit a man's account under the impression <lb/>
            that he has a surplus, if it casts up right and nothing remains, <lb/>
            you allow it,2 so should you now accept the fair conclusion of <lb/>
            the argument. Only see, how rotten in its nature (and justly <lb/>
            so) is every wicked contrivance ! For by this very cunning <lb/>
            simile he has now acknowledged it to be your conviction, that <lb/>
            I am my country's advocate and he is Philip's. Had not this <lb/>
            been your opinion of each, he would not have tried to persuade <lb/>
            you differently. That he has however no reasonable ground <lb/>
            for requiring you to change your belief, I can easily show, <lb/>
            not by casting accounts-for that mode of reckoning applies <lb/>
            not to measures-but by calling the circumstances briefly <lb/>
            to mind, taking you that hear me both for auditors and <lb/>
            witnesses.</p>

              master of the Hellespont by taking Byzantium, the Byzan­ <lb/>

              of services, think you, resemble the casting of accounts? Or <lb/>
              should we strike these out on a balance,' and not look that <lb/>

          <p>The expressions <foreign xml:lang="grc">τιθεὶς Ψήφους, ἀντανελεῖν</foreign>, refer to the use of counters <lb/>
            by the ancients in their arithmetical processes. Hence comes our word <lb/>
            “calculation," from calculus, a stone or counter used for such purpose. <lb/>
            A literal translation of these expressions would hardly be intelligible in <lb/>
            our language, and therefore I have avoided it. <note type="footnote"> 1 I. e. strike them out of the credit side of the account, by means of <lb/>
            a set-off on the debit side. Lord Brougham : “ must these events be <lb/>
            taken out of the opposite side of my account ?” The meaning is pro­ <lb/>
            perly explained by Reiske: " Existimasne, res has præclare a me gestas <lb/>
            ex hominum memorial tolli debere propter ingentes clades quas passi <lb/>
            sumus ?” Schaefer, who is followed by Jacobs and Pabst, has given a <lb/>
            different interpretation. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ταυ̑τα</foreign>, according to him, means both the ser­ <lb/>
            vices of Demosthenes, and the malpractices of Æschines; and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀντανελεῖν <lb/>
            ταυ̑ται</foreign>s to set them off against one another, to mutually cancel them. <lb/>
            Pabst introduces this amplification of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταυ̑τα</foreign> into his text, feeling per­ <lb/>
            haps that the reader would not gather it from the context: glaubst Du, <lb/>
            dass man Das, was ich für, Du gegen das Vaterland gethan hamt, gegen <lb/>
            einander aufheben müsse. This interpretation is not only not borne <lb/>
            out by the words, but contrary to the scope of the whole passage. De­ <lb/>
            mosthenes is not saying anything here about the misdeeds of Æschines; <lb/>
            and the notion of setting them off against his own services was too <lb/>
            palpably absurd to suggest for a moment. He has been enumerating <lb/>
            certain good results of his administration. His argument is: “These <lb/>
            are positive services which I have rendered you, deserving gratitude <lb/>
            and permanent record. You cannot treat them as credits, to be can. <lb/>
            celled by a debit side of the question. Such a mode of reckoning is <lb/>
            well enough for an arithmetical computation, but is inapplicable to a <lb/>
            case of this kind." Here he stops short, and why ? He felt that at this <lb/>
            very moment Chæronea and its results, constantly present to his own <lb/>
            thoughts, might cross the minds of his hearers; and that he might be <lb/>
            met with the objection,—“ If you take credit for the victories, you must <lb/>
            have the discredit of the defeats: your policy must be judged of as <lb/>
            a whole." To this indeed he had an answer, but not exactly in the <lb/>
            present line of argument; therefore he turns it off, spurning the bare <lb/>
            idea of Æschines’ illustration. </note> <lb/>

            trial; whilst of the generosity, which, casting about for his <lb/>
            future purposes, he assumed towards Athens, you have hap­ <lb/>
            pily enjoyed the fruits. I pass that by.</p>
          <p>Yet this I do not hesitate to say; that any one desirous of <lb/>
            truly testing an orator, not of calumniating him, would never <lb/>
            have made the charges that you advanced just now, inventing <lb/>
            similes, mimicking words and gestures: (doubtless it hath <lb/>
            determined the fortune of Greece, whether I spoke this word <lb/>
            or that, whether I moved my hand one way or the other!) no! <lb/>
            he would have examined the facts of the case, what means and <lb/>
            resources our country possessed, when I entered on the admi­ <lb/>
            nistration, what, when I applied myself to it, I collected for <lb/>
            her, and what was the condition of our adversaries. Then, <lb/>
            if I had lessened her resources, he would have shown me to <lb/>
            be guilty; if I had greatly increased them, he would not have <lb/>
            calumniated me. However, as you have declined this course, <lb/>
            I will adopt it. See if I state the case fairly.</p>
          <p>For resources—our country possessed the islanders; not <lb/>
            all, but the weakest; for neither Chios, nor Rhodes, nor <lb/>
            Corcyra was with us: subsidies 1 she had amounting to five­ <lb/>
            and-forty talents; and they were anticipated: infantry or <lb/>
            cavalry, none besides the native. But what was most alarming <lb/>
            and wrought most in favour of the enemy-these men had got <lb/>
            all our neighbours to be hostile rather than friendly to us; <lb/>
            Megarians, Thebans, Eubœans. Such were the circumstances <lb/>
            of our state; no man can say anything to the contrary: look <lb/>
            now at those of Philip, whom we had to contend with. In <lb/>
            the first place, he ruled his followers with unlimited sway, the <lb/>
            most important thing for military operations: in the next <lb/>
            place, they had arms always in their hands : besides, he had <lb/>
            plenty of money, and did what he pleased, not giving notice <lb/>
            by decrees, not deliberating openly, not brought to trial by <lb/>
            calumniators, not defending indictments for illegal measures, <lb/>
            not responsible to any one, but himself absolute master, <lb/>
            leader, and lord of alL I, who was matched against him—for <lb/>
            it is right to examine this-what had I under my control ? <lb/>
            Nothing. Public speech, for instance, the only thing open to <lb/>
            me—even to this you invited his hirelings as well as my­ <lb/>
            self ; and whenever they prevailed over me, (as often happened <note type="footnote"> 1 The tribute from the islanders. See voL i. p. 77, note 1. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="89"/>
            for some cause or other,) your resolutions were passed1 for <lb/>
            the enemy's good. Still under these disadvantages I got you <lb/>
            for allies Eubœans, Achæans, Corinthians, Thebans, Megarians, <lb/>
            Leucadians, Corcyræans; from whom were collected fifteen <lb/>
            thousand mercenaries and two thousand horse, besides the <lb/>
            national troops.2 Of money too I procured as large a contri­ <lb/>
            bution as possible.</p>
          <p>If you talk about just conditions with the Thebans,3 Æs­ <lb/>
            chines, or with the Byzantines or Eubœans, or discuss now <lb/>
            the question of equal terms, first I say—you are ignorant <lb/>
            that of those galleys formerly which defended Greece, being <lb/>
            three hundred in number, our commonwealth furnished two <lb/>
            hundred, and never (as it seemed) thought herself injured by <lb/>
            having done so, never prosecuted those who advised it or ex­ <lb/>
            pressed any disSatisfaction ;-shame on her if she had!-but <lb/>
            was grateful to the gods, that, when a common danger beset <lb/>
            the Greeks, she alone furnished double what the rest did for <lb/>
            the preservation of all. Besides, it is but a poor favour you <lb/>
            do your countrymen by calumniating me. For what is the <lb/>
            use of telling us now what we should have done?-Why,, <lb/>
            being in the city and present, did you not make your pro­ <lb/>
            posals then; if indeed they were practicable at a crisis, when <lb/>
            we had to accept not what we liked but what the circum­ <lb/>
            stances allowed? Remember, there was one ready to bid <lb/>
            against us, to welcome eagerly those that we rejected, and <lb/>

            of the garrisons, the trenches, the levies for our fortifications, <lb/>

            election of a commissioner of grain, they chose me in pre­ <lb/>
            ference to all. Afterwards, when those who were bent to do <lb/>
            me a mischief conspired, and brought indictments, audits, <lb/>
            impeachments and the rest of it against me, not at first in <lb/>
            their own persons, but in such names as they imagined would <lb/>
            most effectually screen themselves, (for you surely know and <lb/>
            remember, that every day of that first period I was arraigned, <lb/>
            and neither the desperation of Sosicles, nor the malignity of <lb/>
            Philocrates, nor the madness of Diondas and Melantus, nor <lb/>
            anything else was left untried by them against me;) on all <lb/>
            those occasions, chiefly through the Gods, secondly through <lb/>
            you and the other Athenians. I was preserved. And with <lb/>
            justice! Yes, that is the truth, and to the honour of the <lb/>
            juries who so conscientiously decided. Well then: on the <lb/>
            impeachments, when you acquitted me and gave not the pro­ <lb/>
            secutors their share of the votes, you pronounced that my <lb/>
            policy was the best.: by my acquittal on the indictments my <lb/>
            counsels and motions were shown to be legal; by your pass­ <lb/>
            ing of my accounts you acknowledged my whole conduct to <lb/>
            have been honest and incorruptible. Under these circum­ <lb/>
            stances, what name could Ctesiphon with decency or justice <lb/>
            give to my acts ? Not that which he saw the people give, <lb/>
            which he saw the jurors give-which he saw truth establish <lb/>
            to the world ?</p>
          <p>Aye, says he; but that was a fine thing of Cephalus, never <lb/>
            to have been indicted. Yes, and a lucky one too. But why <lb/>
            should a man, who has often been charged, but never con­ <lb/>
            victed of crime, be a whit the more liable to reproach? How­ <lb/>
            ever, men of Athens, against my opponent I have a right to <lb/>
            use the boast of Cephalus ; for he never preferred or pro­ <lb/>
            secuted any indictment against me; therefore I am a citizen <lb/>
            as good as Cephalus by his admission.</p>
          <p>From many things one may see his unfeelingness and <lb/>
            malignity, but especially from his discourse about fortune. <lb/>
            For my part, I regard any one, who reproaches his fellow-man <lb/>
            with fortune, as devoid of sense. He that is best satisfied <lb/>
            with his condition, he that deems his fortune excellent, can­ <lb/>
            not be sure that it will remain so until the evening: how then <lb/>
            can it be right to bring it forward, or upbraid another man <lb/>
             <pb n="93"/>
            with it ? As AEschines, however, has on this subject (besides <lb/>
            many others) expressed himself with insolence, look, men of <lb/>
            Athens, and observe how much more truth and humanity <lb/>
            there shall be in my discourse upon fortune1 than in his.</p>
          <p>I hold the fortune of our commonwealth to be good, and <lb/>
            so I find the oracles of Dodonæan Jupiter and Pythian Apollo <lb/>
            declaring to us. The fortune of all mankind, which now pre­ <lb/>
            vails, I consider cruel and dreadful: for what Greek, what <lb/>
            barbarian, has not in these times experienced a multitude of <lb/>
            evils ? That Athens chose the noblest policy, that she fares <lb/>
            better than those very Greeks who thought, if they aban­ <lb/>
            doned us, they should abide in prosperity, I reckon as part of <lb/>
            her good fortune: if she suffered reverses, if all happened not <lb/>
            to us as we desired, I conceive she has had that share of the <lb/>
            general fortune which fell to our lot. As to my fortune (per­ <lb/>
            sonally speaking) or that of any individual among us, it <lb/>
            should, as I conceive, be judged of in connexion with personal <lb/>
            matters. Such is my opinion upon the subject of fortune, a <lb/>
            right and just one, as it appears to me, and I think you will <lb/>
            agree with it. Æschines says that my individual fortune is <note type="footnote"> I “ Les anciens donnoient beaucoup A la fatality: c'étoit une force <lb/>

          <p>However, if you are determined, Æschines, to scrutinize my <lb/>

            the very beginning. And I pray and entreat that I may not <lb/>
            be condemned for bad taste. 1 I don't think any person wise, <lb/>
            who insults poverty, or who prides himself on having been <lb/>
            bred in affluence: but by the slander and malice of this cruel <lb/>
            man I am forced into such a discussion; which I will conduct <lb/>
            with all the moderation which circumstances allow.</p>
          <p>I had the advantage, AEschines, in my boyhood of going to <lb/>
            proper schools, and having such allowance as a boy should <lb/>
            have who is to do nothing mean from indigence. Arrived at <lb/>
            man's estate, I lived suitably to my breeding; was choir- <lb/>
            master, ship-commander, rate-payer ; backward in no acts of <lb/>
            liberality public or private, but making myself useful to the <lb/>
            commonwealth and to my friends. When I entered upon <lb/>
            state affairs, I chose such a line of politics, that both by my <lb/>
            country and many people of Greece I have been crowned <lb/>
            many times, and not even you my enemies venture to say <lb/>
            that the line I chose was not honourable. Such then has <lb/>
            been the fortune of my life: I could enlarge upon it, but I <lb/>
            forbear, lest what I pride myself in should give offence.</p>
          <p>But you, the man of dignity, who spit upon others, look <lb/>
            what sort of fortune is yours compared with mine. As a boy <lb/>
            you were reared in abject poverty, waiting with your father <lb/>
            on the school, grinding the ink, sponging the benches, sweep­ <lb/>

            howler! In the daytime you led your noble orgiasts, crowned <lb/>
            with fennel and poplar, through the highways, squeezing the <lb/>
            big-cheeked serpents, and lifting them over your head, and <lb/>
            shouting Evœ Sabœ, and capering to the words Ryes Attes, <lb/>
            Attes Ryes, saluted by the beldames as Leader, Conductor, <lb/>
            Chest-bearer, Fan-bearer, and the like, getting as your reward <lb/>

          <p>When you were enrolled among your fellow-townsmen—by <lb/>
            Claudian, Raptus Pros. lib. i. Ululatibus Ide Bacchatur. and lib. ii. <lb/>
            ululantia Dindyma Gallis.</p>
          <p>Poplar, supposed to be the growth of the infernal region, was sacred <lb/>
            (as Harpocration says) to the son of Proserpine. Fennel was supposed <lb/>
            to have a peculiar virtue. A species of fennel is mentioned by Virgil <lb/>
            (Eclog. X. 25) as carried by Sylvanus: <lb/>
            Florentes ferulas et grandia lilia quassans.</p>
          <p>As to the serpents, see Bacchæ, v. 697. Ceres is drawn by serpents <lb/>
            in Claudian Rapt. Pros. lib. i. Compare Plutarch, Vit. Alex. 2.</p>
          <p>The exclamations <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐοῖ σαβοῖ</foreign> are Thracian, perhaps of eastern origin. <lb/>
            Bacchus is called Evius and Sabazius. See Orph. Hymn 47, Pluto <lb/>
            Symp. iv. 5. "<foreign xml:lang="grc">ϒης ἄττης</foreign> are Phrygian. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Θίασος</foreign> is the common term <lb/>
            for a troop of Bacchanals (Bacchæ, 56.) The god himself is called <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔξαρχος</foreign> (Bacchæ, 141.) <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δίκνος</foreign> is the “ mystica vannus Iacchi” (Virgil <lb/>

            Callimach. Hymn. ad Jovem, 48. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">κίστα</foreign> contained the arcane <lb/>
            symbols of the mysteries. Such was the <foreign xml:lang="grc">κάλαθος</foreign> of Ceres (Callimach. <lb/>
            Hymn. ad Cererem, 1, Taylor's Eleusinian and Bacchic Mysteries, 119.) <note type="footnote"> 1 I consider it better to give this turn than to write, " for which who <lb/>
            would not," &amp;c., which suits not the English idiom so well. But you <lb/>
            may keep the interrogative, if you turn " for which " into " for such <lb/>
            things," as Pabst and Jacobs do. </note><note type="footnote"> Here I cannot forbear noticing the fulsome eulogy pronounced by the <lb/>

            it is clever, but it certainly deserves not the epithets of “ terse and <lb/>
            pointed," which have been applied to it. He himself would disdain such <lb/>
            an encomium, for he insists that it is necessary to expand and dilute <lb/>
            the expressions of the original, and he translates upon that system. <lb/>
            Thus, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ διαπτύων</foreign> is, It who considers worthy only of the spittle of his <lb/>

            “ all the crones and beldames of the quarter,” and so on. I suppose <lb/>
            these are questions of taste. For my own part, I think there was much <lb/>
            wisdom in the saying of the clergyman, who excused himself to his <lb/>
            congregation for preaching longer than usual, on the plea that he had <lb/>
            not had time to make his sermon shorter. </note> <lb/>

            what means I stop not to inquire-when you were enrolled <lb/>
            however, you immediately selected the most honourable of <lb/>
            employments, that of clerk and assistant to our petty magis­ <lb/>
            trates. From this you were removed after a while, having <lb/>
            done yourself all that you charge others with; and then, sure <lb/>
            enough, you disgraced not your antecedents by your sub­ <lb/>
            sequent life, but hiring yourself to those ranting players, as <lb/>
            they were called, Simylus and Socrates, you acted third parts, <lb/>
            collecting figs and grapes and olives like a fruiterer from <lb/>
            other men's farms, and getting more from them than from <lb/>
            the playing, in which the lives of your whole company were <lb/>
            at stake; for there was an implacable and incessant war <lb/>
            between them and the audience, from whom you received so <lb/>
            many wounds, that no wonder you taunt as cowards people <lb/>
            inexperienced in such encounters.'</p>
          <p>But passing over what may be imputed to poverty, I will <lb/>
            come to the direct charges against your character. You <lb/>
            espoused such a line of politics, (when at last you thought of <lb/>
            taking to them,) that, if your country prospered, you lived <lb/>
            the life of a hare, fearing and trembling and ever expecting to <lb/>
            be scourged for the crimes of which your conscience accused <lb/>
            you; though all have seen how bold you were during the <lb/>
            misfortunes of the rest. A man who took courage at the <lb/>
            death of a thousand citizens-what does he deserve at the <lb/>
            hands of the living? A great deal more that I could say <lb/>
            about him I shall omit: for it is not all I can tell of his tur­ <lb/>
            pitude and infamy which I ought to let slip from my tongue, <lb/>
            but only what is not disgraceful to myself to mention. <note type="footnote"> 1 The commentators and translators have all misunderstood this pas­ <lb/>
            sage, imagining that Æschines and his troop are charged with strolling <lb/>
            about the country and robbing orchards. Nothing could be more <lb/>
            foreign to the meaning. Taking Bekker's text, and omitting the first <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τραύματα</foreign>, the explanation is simply as follows:­ </note><note type="footnote"> Æschines and his fellow-players acted so badly, that they were pelted <lb/>
            by the audience with figs, grapes, and olives,-as we should say, with <lb/>
            oranges. The players picked up these missiles, and were glad to pocket <lb/>
            the affront. Such quantities were showered upon the stage, that they <lb/>
            got enough to stock a fruiterer's shop; so they were supplied, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὥσπερ <lb/>
            ὀπωρώνης</foreign> lie <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῶν ἀλλοτρων χωρίων</foreign>, like a dealer in fruit, who purchases <lb/>
            his stock from various farmers and gardeners. From this source Æschines <lb/>
            derived more profit, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλείω λαμβάνων ἀπὸ τούτων</foreign>, than from the dra­ <lb/>
            matic contests, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῶν ἀγώνων</foreign>, for which the company were ill paid, and <lb/>
            in which, they ran the risk of their lives every day from the indignation <lb/>
            of the audience. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> H </note> <pb n="98"/>
             </p>
          <p>Contrast now the circumstances of your life and mine, <lb/>
            gently and with temper, Æschines; and then ask these people <lb/>
            whose fortune they would each of them prefer. You taught <lb/>
            reading, I went to school: you performed initiations, I re­ <lb/>
            ceived them : you danced in the chorus, I furnished it: you <lb/>
            were assembly-clerk, I was a speaker: you acted third parts, <lb/>
            I heard you: you broke down, and I hissed: you have <lb/>
            worked as a statesman for the enemy, I for my country.1 I <lb/>
            pass by the rest; but this very day I am on my probation <lb/>
            for a crown, and am acknowledged to be innocent of all <lb/>
            offence; whilst you are already judged to be a pettifogger, <lb/>
            and the question is, whether you shall continue that trade, or <lb/>
            at once be silenced by not getting a fifth part of the votes. <lb/>
            A happy fortune, do you see, you have enjoyed, that you <lb/>
            should denounce mine as miserable !</p>
          <p>Come now, let me read the evidence to the jury of public <lb/>
            services which I have performed. And by way of comparison <lb/>
            do you recite me the verses which you murdered: <lb/>
            From Hades and the dusky realms I come. <lb/>
            And <lb/>

          <p>Such has been my character in political matters. In pri­ <lb/>
            vate, if you do not all know that I have been liberal and <lb/>
            humane and charitable to the distressed, I am silent, I will <lb/>

            of persons whom I ransomed from the enemy, or of persons <lb/>
            whose daughters I helped to portion, or anything of the kind. <lb/>
            For this is my maxim. I hold that the party receiving an - <lb/>
            obligation should ever remember it, the party conferring <lb/>
            should forget it immediately, if the one is to act with <lb/>
            honesty, the other without meanness. To remind and speak <lb/>
            of your own bounties is next door to reproaching.1 I will not <lb/>
            act so : nothing shall induce me. Whatever my reputation <lb/>
            is in these respects, I am content with it.</p>
          <p>I will have done then with private topics, but say another <lb/>
            word or two upon public. If you can mention, Æschines, a <lb/>
            single man under the sun, whether Greek or barbarian, who <lb/>
            has not suffered by Philip's power formerly and Alexanders <lb/>
            now, well and good; I concede to you, that my fortune, or <lb/>
            misfortune (if you please), has been the cause of everything. <lb/>
            But if many that never saw me or heard my voice have been <lb/>
            grievously afflicted, not individuals only but whole cities and <lb/>
            nations; how much juster and fairer is it to consider, that <lb/>
            to the common fortune apparently of all men, to a tide of <lb/>
            events overwhelming and lamentable,2 these disasters are to <note type="footnote"> The position of the words however is against this interpretation; for <lb/>

            not iniquitous and monstrous to complain now of measures, <lb/>

          <p>Among all other people I find these principles in a manner <lb/>

            object of wrath and punishment. Hath a man erred unin­ <lb/>
            tentionally ? There is pardon instead of punishment for him. <lb/>
            Has a man devoted himself to what seemed for the general <lb/>
            good, and without any fault or misconduct been in common <lb/>
            with all disappointed of success? Such a one deserves not <lb/>
            obloquy or reproach, but sympathy. These principles will <lb/>
            not be found in our statutes only: Nature herself has defined <lb/>
            them by her unwritten laws and the feelings of humanity. <lb/>
            .AEschines however has so far surpassed all men in brutality <lb/>
            and malignity, that even things which he cited himself as <lb/>
            misfortunes he imputes to me as crimes.</p>
          <p>And besides-as if he himself had spoken everything with <lb/>
            candour and goodwill-he told you to watch me, and mind <note type="footnote"> 1 The meaning is—“ you charge me with this universal ruin, though <lb/>
            I was merely an Athenian citizen who took my share, together with <lb/>
            my fellow-citizens, in the politics of my own country, but could have <lb/>
            nothing to do with the affairs of other people, on whom similar calami. <lb/>
            ties fell." So Reiske interprets <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρὰ τουτοισί</foreign>—“ designat pro more <lb/>
            judices civesque Athenienses" Pabst however takes these words to refer <lb/>

            that I did not cajole and deceive you, calling me a great <lb/>
            orator,1 a juggler, a sophist, and the like: as though, if a man <lb/>
            says of another what applies to himself, it must be true, and <lb/>
            the hearers are not to inquire who the person is that makes <lb/>
            the charge. Certain am I, that you are all acquainted with <lb/>
            my opponentis character, and believe these charges to be more <lb/>
            applicable to him than to me. And of this I am sure, that <lb/>
            my oratory-let it be so: though indeed I find, that the <lb/>
            speaker's power depends for the most part on the hearers; for <lb/>
            according to your reception and favour it is, that the wisdom <lb/>
            of a speaker is esteemed-if I however possess any ability of <lb/>
            this sort, you will find it has been exhibited always in public <lb/>
            business on your. behalf never against you or on personal <lb/>
            matters; whereas that of AEschines has been displayed not <lb/>
            only in speaking for the enemy, but against all persons who <lb/>
            ever offended or quarrelled with him. It is not for justice or <lb/>
            the good of the commonwealth that he employs it. A citizen <lb/>
            of worth and honour should not call upon judges, impanelled <lb/>

            thing of that kind; nor should he come before you upon <lb/>
            such grounds. The best thing is not to have these feelings; <lb/>
            but, if it cannot be helped, they should be mitigated and <lb/>
            restrained.</p>
          <p>On what occasions ought an orator and statesman to be <lb/>
            vehement? Where any of the commonwealth's main interests <lb/>
            are in jeopardy, and he is opposed to the adversaries of the <lb/>
            people.2 Those are the occasions for a generous and brave <lb/>
            citizen. But for a person, who never sought to punish me for <lb/>
            any offence either public or private, on the state's behalf or <lb/>
            on his own, to have got up an accusation because I am <lb/>
            crowned and honoured, and to have expended such a mul­ <lb/>
            titude of words--this is a proof of personal enmity and spite <lb/>
            and meanness, not of anything good. And then his leaving <lb/>
            the controversy with me, and attacking the defendant, com­ <lb/>
            prises everything that is base.3</p>
          <p>I should conclude, Æschines, that you undertook this <note type="footnote"> 1 See p. 90, note 2. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Or, “ he has to do with the adversaries of the people," omitting <foreign xml:lang="grc">τι</foreign> <lb/>

            obtain satisfaction for any wrong. But it is not the language <lb/>
            of an orator, Æschines, that has any value, nor yet the tone of <lb/>
            his voice, but his adopting the same views with the people, and <lb/>
            his hating and loving the same persons that his country does. <lb/>
            He that is thus minded will say everything with loyal inten­ <lb/>
            tion : he that courts persons from whom the commonwealth <lb/>
            apprehends danger to herself, rides not on the same an­ <lb/>
            chorage with the people, and therefore has not the same <lb/>

            objects are the same with those of my countrymen; I have <lb/>
            no interest separate or distinct. Is that so with you ? How <lb/>
            can it be-when immediately after the battle you went as <lb/>
            ambassador to Philip, who was at that period the author of <lb/>
            your country's calamities, notwithstanding that you had be­ <lb/>
            fore persisted in refusing that office,1 as all men know?</p>
          <p>And who is it that deceives the state ? Surely the man <lb/>
            who speaks not what he thinks. On whom does the crier <lb/>
            pronounce a cursed Surely on such a man. What greater <lb/>
            crime can an orator be charged with, than that his opinions <lb/>
            and his language are not the same? Such is found to be <lb/>
            your character. And yet you open your mouth, and dare to <lb/>
            look these men in the faces ! Do you think they don't know <lb/>
            you?—or are sunk all in such slumber and oblivion, as not to <lb/>
            remember the speeches which you delivered in the assembly, <lb/>
            cursing and swearing that you had nothing to do with Philip, <lb/>
            and that I brought that charge against you out of personal <lb/>
            enmity without foundation? No sooner came the news of <lb/>
            the battle, than you forgot all that; you acknowledged and <lb/>
            avowed that between Philip and yourself there subsisted a <lb/>
            relation of hospitality and friendship—new names these for <note type="footnote"> 1 This is to be understood only of the last six years before Chæronea. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This curse was pronounced at every assembly of the people and <lb/>

            Attic orators. In the speech on the Embassy (p. 363), Demosthenes <lb/>
            causes it to be read to the jury. At the meeting of ladies in the Thes­ <lb/>

            justice could Æschines, son of Glaucothea the timbrel-player,' <lb/>
            be the friend or acquaintance of Philip ? I cannot see. No! <lb/>
            You were hired to ruin the interests of your countrymen: <lb/>

          <p>Many great and glorious enterprises has the commonwealth, <lb/>

            she did not forget them. Here is the proof-On the election <lb/>

            the event, you were proposed, but the people would not have <lb/>

              feature of Demosthenes, and formed also one of the characteristics of Mr. <lb/>

              their affairs, as the dishonesty of you and your party; for <lb/>
              what you denied upon oath in our prosperity, you confessed <lb/>
              in the misfortunes of the republic. They considered there­ <lb/>

              public disasters had been their enemies long before, and were <lb/>
              then avowedly such. They thought it right also, that the <lb/>
              person who was to speak in honour of the fallen and cele­ <lb/>
              brate their valour, should not have sat under the .same roof <lb/>
              or at the same table1 with their antagonists; that he should <lb/>
              not revel there and sing a pæan over the calamities of Greece <lb/>
              in company with their murderers, and then come here and <lb/>
              receive distinction; that he should not with his voice act the <lb/>
              mourner of their fate, but that he should lament over them <lb/>
              with his heart. This they perceived in themselves and in. <lb/>
              me, but not in any of you : therefore they elected me, and <lb/>
              not you. Nor, while the people felt thus, did the fathers and <lb/>
              brothers of the deceased, who were chosen by the people to <lb/>
              perform their obsequies, feel differently. For having to order <lb/>
              the funeral banquet (aocording to custom)2 at the house of <lb/>
              the nearest relative to the deceased, they ordered it at mine. <lb/>
              And with reason: because, though each to his own was <lb/>
              nearer of kin than I was, none was so near to them all col­ <lb/>
              lectively. He that had the deepest interest in their safety <lb/>

            me, 0 Athenians, but one thing surprised me more than all, <lb/>
            that, when he mentioned the late misfortunes of the country, <lb/>
            he felt not as became a well-disposed and upright citizen, he <lb/>
            shed no tear, experienced no such emotion: with a loud voice, <lb/>
            exulting, and straining his throat, he imagined apparently <lb/>
            that he was accusing me, whilst he was giving proof against <lb/>
            himself, that our distresses touched him not in the same <lb/>
            manner as the rest. A person who pretends, as he did, to <lb/>
            care for the laws and constitution, ought at least to have this <lb/>
            about him, that he grieves and rejoices for the same cause as <lb/>
            the people, and not by his politics to be enlisted in the ranks <lb/>
            of the enemy, as Æschines has plainly done, saying1 that I <lb/>
            am the cause of all, and that the commonwealth has fallen <lb/>
            into troubles through me, when it was not owing to my views <lb/>
            or principles that you began to assist the Greeks; for, if you <lb/>
            conceded2 this to me, that my influence caused you to resist <lb/>
            the subjugation of Greece, it would be a higher honour than <lb/>
            any that you have bestowed upon others. I myself would <lb/>
            not make such an assertion-it would be doing you injustice <lb/>
            -nor <unclear>you</unclear> allow it, I am sure ; and Æschines, if he <lb/>

          <p>As to this fortification, for which you ridiculed me,1 of the <lb/>

            praise, and so they are; but I place them nowhere near my <lb/>

            I fortify Athens: nor is this the ministry on which I most <lb/>
            pride myself. Would you view my fortifications aright, you <lb/>
            will find arms, and states, and posts, and harbours, and <lb/>
            galleys, and horses, and men for their defence.' These are <lb/>
            the bulwarks with which I protected Attica, as far as was <lb/>
            possible by human wisdom; with these I fortified our terri­ <lb/>

            of the enemy, and supplied what the commonwealth was <lb/>

            judice, men of Athens, will find they were rightly planned <lb/>

            you are tired of a constant speaker, or when some reverse of <lb/>
            fortune has befallen you, or anything untoward has happened, <lb/>
            (and many are the casualties of human life :) at such a crisis <lb/>
            he springs up an orator, rising from his retreat like a wind; <lb/>

            was not a little proud of it. A good voice must indeed have been a great <lb/>
            advantage to an Athenian speaker, who had to address thousands of <lb/>
            people in the open air. But Æchines not only possessed a voice that <lb/>

            prodigious though they are beyond all power of expression, <lb/>

            those of the illustrious ancients, and to have had the same <lb/>
            objects in view, while yours resemble those of their calumnia­ <lb/>
            tors : for it is certain there were persons in those times, who <lb/>
            ran down the living, and praised people dead and gone, with <lb/>

          <p>You say that I am nothing like the ancients. Are you like <lb/>
            them, AEschines ? Is your brother, or any of our speakers ? <lb/>
            I assert that none is. But pray, my good fellow, (that I <lb/>
            may give you no other name,) try the living with the living <lb/>
            and with his competitors, as you would in all cases-poets, <lb/>
            dancers, athletes. Philammon did not, because he was infe­ <lb/>

            a bygone age, depart uncrowned from Olympia, but, because <lb/>
            he beat all who entered the ring against him, was crowned <lb/>
            and proclaimed conqueror.1 So I ask you to compare me <lb/>
            with the orators of the day, with yourself, with any one you <lb/>
            like: I yield to none. When the commonwealth was at liberty <lb/>
            to choose for her advantage, and patriotism was a matter <lb/>
            of emulation, I showed myself a better counsellor than any, <lb/>
            and every act of state was pursuant to my decrees and laws <note type="footnote"> 1 An anecdote of this Glaucus is told by Pausanias (vi. 10). He used <lb/>
            to drive his father's plough, and one day, when the coulter was loose, <lb/>
            he knocked it in with his fist. His father, having seen this feat, took <lb/>
            him to Olympia, and entered him in the ring as a pugilist. He <lb/>
            was nearly beaten for want of skill, when his father called out, "Strike <lb/>
            as you did the coulter," on which he redoubled his efforts, and won the <lb/>

            you had to do the Athenians a mischief. After that lament­ <lb/>
            able occurrence, when there was a call no longer for advisers, <lb/>
            but for persons obedient to command, persons ready to be <lb/>
            hired against their country and willing to flatter strangers, <lb/>
            then all of you were in occupation, grand people with splendid <lb/>

            upon nature; power and might upon other things. Such a <lb/>
            spirit, you will find, I have ever sincerely cherished. Only <lb/>
            see. When my person was demanded-when they brought <lb/>
            Amphictyonic suits against me—when they menaced-when <lb/>
            they promised—when they set these miscreants like wild <lb/>
            beasts upon me—never in any way have I abandoned my <lb/>
            affection for you. From the very beginning I chose an honest <lb/>
            and straightforward course in politics, to support the honour, <lb/>
            the power, the glory of my fatherland, these to exalt, in these <lb/>
            to have my being. I do not walk about the market-place <lb/>
            gay and cheerful because the stranger has prospered, holding <lb/>
            out my right hand and congratulating those who I think will <lb/>
            report it yonder, and on any news of our own success shudder <lb/>
            and groan and stoop to the earth, like these impious men, <lb/>
            who rail at Athens, as if in so doing they did not rail at <lb/>

            is a good expression, and sounds well at the close.."Inviolable security" <lb/>

            of divine protection, or safety derived from the Gods. The prayer of <lb/>
            Demosthenes is, that his countrymen may not only be extricated from <lb/>
            their present state of suspense and anxiety, but may have the insurance <lb/>
            of divine protection for the future. In effect, he prays for the deliver­ <lb/>
            ance of Athens from a foreign yoke, and the restoration of her ancient <lb/>
            dignity. His language is purposely vague, but was not the less felt and <lb/>
            understood by his hearers. The very prayer which invokes a blessing <lb/>
            upon the Athenians is designed to impress the conviction upon them, <lb/>
            that Æschines was their deadly enemy, who would regard their welfare <lb/>

          <p>Demosthenes appears in this cause as the conductor of a prosecution <lb/>
            against Æschines for treasonable practices in the embassy which pre­ <lb/>
            ceded the peace of B.O. 346. The circumstances connected with that <lb/>
            embassy are so fully explained in the third Appendix to Volume I, <lb/>
            and in the first Appendix to this Volume, that it will be. sufficient to <lb/>
            advert briefly to them, while we inquire more particularly into certain <lb/>
            matters that took place after the conclusion of the peace and before <lb/>
            this prosecution. An interval of three years elapsed between those <lb/>
            two events. AEschines was then accused and brought to trial, not <lb/>
            only for neglect and misconduct in the performance of his duty as <lb/>
            ambassador, but for positive corruption and betrayal of his country's <lb/>
            interests to Philip. It will naturally be asked why the proceeding <lb/>
            against him on such grave charges was so long delayed. For this <lb/>
            various causes may be assigned.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding the dissatisfaction of the Athenians at the conditions <lb/>
            and consequences of the peace, and at the triumph and advantage <lb/>
            which Philip had obtained, there was a general reluctance to bring on <lb/>
            any public discussion of the matter, which might possibly provoke <lb/>
            a new quarrel, for which the Athenians were ill prepared. It was felt <lb/>
            that an exposure of the artifices by which the people were deluded <lb/>
            would reflect some disgrace upon them for their credulity. All parties <lb/>
            concerned in the negotiation for peace were in some measure respon­ <note type="footnote"> dern Ihr vor allen Dingen auch diesen hier einen bessern Sinn und <lb/>

            sible for it, and among these Demosthenes himself: and therefore, <lb/>
            while he was the first to call the attention of his countrymen to the <lb/>
            misdeeds of his colleagues, he forbore for some time to take any active <lb/>
            steps against them. Again, whatever ground there might be for sus­ <lb/>
            pecting Æschines and Philocrates of corrupt practices, there appeared <lb/>
            no substantial proof against them, at least none such as would be <lb/>
            sufficient to convict them in a court of justice. Moreover, they were <lb/>
            supported by a powerful party, at the head of which were Eubulus and <lb/>
            Phocion, and which comprised most of those citizens who were anxious <lb/>
            to preserve peace with Macedonia. Demosthenes, although he had <lb/>
            acquired a great reputatioi both as a statesman and an orator, had <lb/>
            not yet attained that high position as minister of the commonwealth, <lb/>
            to which a few more years served to raise him. These were the causes <lb/>
            which for a long time prevented any formal proceeding against the <lb/>
            suspected parties.</p>
          <p>The discontent at Athens however continued to increase. The com­ <lb/>
            plaints against the ambassadors were kept alive, not only by private <lb/>
            discussion, but by frequent indirect attacks upon them in the public <lb/>
            debates. Thus, in the Oration on the Peace, Demosthenes reminded <lb/>
            the people how they had been deluded by false reports and promises. <lb/>
            In the second Philippic, without expressly naming either Æschines or <lb/>
            Philocrates, but in language that could not fail to be understood, he <lb/>
            publicly denounced them, and declared that they ought to be called <lb/>
            to account. The part which Æschines took when Python came to <lb/>
            Athens, his addressing the people in support of the Macedonian <lb/>
            envoys, and defending Philip's conduct, by no means tended to in­ <lb/>
            crease his popularity. News was continually arriving at Athens of <lb/>
            some warlike or ambitious movement of Philip, plainly showing that <lb/>
            he would not rest contented even with his present position, but was <lb/>
            making advances in every direction to extend his influence and power. <lb/>
            All this, while it excited the alarm of the Athenians, exalted Demo­ <lb/>
            sthenes in their estimation as a man who possessed more foresight <lb/>
            than his adversaries, and brought them in a corresponding degree <lb/>
            into disrepute. Before the close of the year B.O. 343, many important <lb/>
            events had occurred, showing what advantage Philip had gained by ter­ <lb/>
            minating the Sacred War, and how the safety of Athens was endangered <lb/>
            by his influence in Southern Greece. Such were, the division of <lb/>
            Thessaly into tetrarchies, and the establishment of Philip's adherents <lb/>
            in the government-the conspiracy of Ptoeodorus at Megara, which <lb/>
            nearly threw that city into Philip's hands-his intrigues in Eubœa— <lb/>
            and those in Elis, where a Macedonian faction had become predominant. <lb/>
            Negotiations had been entered into between Philip and the Athenians, <lb/>
            with a view to amend the articles of the peace, and put them on <lb/>
            a basis which should preclude future disputes; but they had proved <lb/>
            wholly ineffectual. Philip was so incensed at the demands made by <lb/>
            the Athenian ambassadors, that he treated them with rudeness, and <lb/>
            even banished from his dominions the poet Xenoclides, because he <lb/>
            had received them into his house. These events are alluded to in the <lb/>
            speech of Demosthenes. Before the trial came on, it is clear that the <lb/>
            Athenian people had begun to regard Philip with increased suspicion <lb/>
            and anger.</p><pb n="118"/>
            
          <p>It would appear also, from a particular passage in the Oration on the <lb/>
            Embassy, that the affair of Antiphon (related more fully in the Oration <lb/>
            on the Crown, ante p. 55) occurred shortly before the present trial. <lb/>
            The part which Æschines took in it caused him to be deprived of an <lb/>
            honourable appointment, that of pleader before the Amphiotyonic <lb/>
            council; so that, if the date which has been assigned is correct, he <lb/>
            must about this time have been in no little disgrace with the public. <lb/>
            The allusions of Demosthenes, however, are not so distinct as to <lb/>
            enable us to speak with much certainty upon the point.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding all the suspicion under which Æschines might lie, it <lb/>
            is very doubtful whether any legal proceeding would ever have been <lb/>
            taken against him, but for the imprudence of his colleague Philo­ <lb/>
            crates, who by his conduct at Athens, by open talk and conversation, <lb/>
            afforded the strongest evidence against himself, and almost provoked <lb/>
            his enemies to bring him to justice. Of the treason of Philocrates <lb/>
            there remains no historical doubt. He had received from Philip large <lb/>
            sums of money and grants of land in Phocis, which brought him in <lb/>
            a considerable income; all this wealth he displayed ostentatiously, <lb/>
            and made no secret of the quarter from which it was derived. About <lb/>
            two years after the peace, and probably not long after the delivery of <lb/>
            the second Philippic, Hyperides undertook to prosecute him. The <lb/>
            law of Athens, in case of high crimes and misdemeanours against the <lb/>
            state, afforded a method of proceeding not unlike an impeachment in <lb/>
            our own law. This method Hyperides adopted. He brought Philo­ <lb/>
            crates before the popular assembly, and there charging him with <lb/>
            treasonable conspiracy, procured a decree of the people ordering him <lb/>
            to be brought to triaL Philocrates, having (as we may presume) <lb/>
            given bail for his appearance to answer the charge, was so conscious <lb/>
            of guilt, and so hopeless of escape, that he sought safety in voluntary <lb/>
            exile.</p>
          <p>This confession of crime on the part of one, with whom on the most <lb/>
            important occasions he had acted in concert, was a severe blow to <lb/>
            Æschines. He had already been menaced with a similar accusation: <lb/>
            for at the time when Hyperides preferred his impeachment, Demo­ <lb/>
            sthenes rose in the assembly, and declared, that there was one thing <lb/>
            in it which dissatisfied him, and this was, that Philocrates was the <lb/>
            only person accused; for it was certain, there must have been accom­ <lb/>
            plices among the ambassadors. " Let those," said he. who disapprove <lb/>
            the conduct of Philocrates, and disclaim connexion with him, come <lb/>
            forward and declare themselves, and I will acquit them from all <lb/>
            blame." No one responded to this challenge; and Demosthenes stood <lb/>
            pledged to follow up his own words, and bring another delinquent to <lb/>
            justice. The flight of Philocrates left no room for hesitation; and <lb/>
            the only question was, what sort of criminal process it was most <lb/>
            advisable to adopt.</p>
          <p>It was open to him to take the same course against Æschines which <lb/>
            Hyperides had taken against Philocrates, viz. to proceed by impeach­ <lb/>
            ment. But the more regular way of proceeding against a public <lb/>
            Dictionary for any crime or misdemeanour relating to his office, was <lb/>
            efer an accusation against him when he presented himself before <lb/>
            ogistæ, or auditors, to render an account of his official duties. <lb/>
             <pb n="119"/>
            We have seen that every person holding an office of importance at <lb/>
            Athens was compelled, after the expiration of his term, to render <lb/>
            an account of the manner in which he had acquitted himself. Am­ <lb/>
            bassadors were subject to the same liability as other servants of <lb/>
            the public, except that no particular time was fixed for their submis­ <lb/>
            sion to the audit, as in other cases. The reason for such difference <lb/>
            may be found in the nature of their employment; ambassadors not <lb/>
            being appointed like ordinary magistrates for any stated term, or at <lb/>
            regular periods, but occasionally, as circumstances might require. <lb/>
            Therefore, while it was competent for any citizen to summon an am­ <lb/>
            bassador before the auditors, and call him to account for the manner <lb/>
            in which he had executed his mission, the law prescribed no positive <lb/>
            time for the ambassador himself to tender his accounts.</p>
          <p>Many embassies must have been simple affairs, involving little or no <lb/>
            responsibility; and we may presume, the ministers employed upon <lb/>
            them would hardly be called upon to go through the ceremony of an <lb/>
            audit. On the other hand, we may reasonably suppose, that persons <lb/>
            commissioned to represent their country on questions of moment, and <lb/>
            to conduct arduous and critical negotiations, would for their own <lb/>
            sakes come before the auditors at the earliest opportunity, and offer <lb/>
            themselves to that public inquiry which the Athenian law in all such <lb/>
            cases invited or allowed. Æschines had not done so; on the con­ <lb/>
            trary, he had suffered three years to elapse without submitting to this <lb/>
            ordeal. But he had raised a point of law, on which his excuse partly <lb/>
            rasted. He contended that there was no necessity to render an ac­ <lb/>
            count of the second embassy, as all the substantial part of the business <lb/>
            had been transacted upon the first; the second journey to Macedonia <lb/>
            was for a matter of form only, to receive the oath of Philip : having <lb/>
            therefore obtained his legal discharge as to the first embassy, he was <lb/>
            to all intents and purposes discharged as to both. Demosthenes took <lb/>
            a different view of the question, and presented himself before the <lb/>
            auditors as having a distinct account to render of his conduct upon <lb/>
            the second embassy. Æschines, seeing that this might be turned <lb/>
            into a precedent against him, came with a large number of friends to <lb/>
            the audit-room, and objected that the account of Demosthenes could <lb/>
            not be received, he being no longer accountable. The objection <lb/>
            was overruled ; Demosthenes went through the necessary forms, and <lb/>
            his account was passed. It does not appear however that this deci­ <lb/>
            sion had any immediate influence upon the conduct of AEschines. The <lb/>
            time when Demosthenes presented himself to the auditors is not <lb/>
            stated; yet I should be disposed to think, it was a considerable time <lb/>
            before the commencement of this prosecution. It was not the legal <lb/>
            precedent, but the force of circumstances, which afterwards deter­ <lb/>
            mined AEschines to follow his adversary's example. Finding after <lb/>
            the flight of Philocrates, that a prosecution against himself was in­ <lb/>
            evitable, he deemed it the most prudent policy to take a bold step; <lb/>
            and accordingly he demanded his audit, thereby challenging any <lb/>
            accuser who dared to come forward and arraign him.</p>
          <p>Several accusers appeared, the principal among them being Timarchus <lb/>
            and Demosthenes. Timarchus had long been known as an active <lb/>
            politician, and for the last few years had zealously exerted himself in <lb/>
             <pb n="120"/>
            opposition to Philip. He was however a man of profligate habits, <lb/>
            and notoriously guilty of certain infamous practices, which by an old <lb/>
            statute of Solon incapacitated him to appear as a speaker in the <lb/>
            public assembly. AEschines seized the opportunity, which this Jaw. <lb/>
            afforded him, of striking a blow, which might at the same time crush <lb/>
            a formidable adversary, and create a prejudice that should help him <lb/>
            materially in his own defence. He demanded, according to the form <lb/>
            of the Attic law, a judicial scrutiny into the character of Timarchus, <lb/>
            and a jury being summoned to try the case, he accused and convicted <lb/>
            him of the crimes above mentioned. The legal consequence of such <lb/>
            conviction was disfranchisement; and AEschines thus in a summary <lb/>
            way got rid of one of his accusers. Demosthenes remained : and his <lb/>
            own trial soon afterwards came on.</p>
          <p>The nature of the case is best learned from the speeches of the rival <lb/>
            orators. Demosthenes, feeling what difficulties he had to contend <lb/>
            with, and how much his own credit was at stake, uses every exertion <lb/>
            to bring home to Æschines those charges which he had been for three <lb/>
            years proclaiming incessantly to the Athenian public, and labours to <lb/>
            supply the want of direct proof by close reasoning, and inferences <lb/>
            from a variety of facts and circumstances. He calls attention at the <lb/>
            outset to the efforts which the defendant's party were making to <lb/>
            screen him from justice. Timarchus had been destroyed, h e says, <lb/>
            not for the good of society, but to deter any other accuser from taking <lb/>
            up the case. Notwithstanding the lapse of time, he undertakes to <lb/>
            prove the following points-that AEschines had deceived the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians by false reports ; that he had given treacherous counsel; that <lb/>
            he had neglected his instructions; that he had lost precious opportu­ <lb/>
            nities by delay; and that he had done all this from corrupt motives. <lb/>
            The charge is in terms confined to the transactions upon the second <lb/>
            embassy; but the discussion is by no means confined to them. <lb/>
            Æschines, according to his opponent's view, was bribed by Philip on <lb/>
            the first embassy, but no one suspected him till some time after. <lb/>
            Dionysius, in his treatise on Rhetoric, commends the skill shown by <lb/>
            Demosthenes in dealing with this part of the subject. It would not <lb/>
            have lain in his mouth to complain of anything done upon the first <lb/>
            journey to Pella, as on his return he had expressed himself satisfied <lb/>
            with all the proceedings, and praised the ambassadors for their con­ <lb/>
            duct. The prosecution therefore is nominally directed to the affairs <lb/>
            of the second embassy, and the orator, contending that Æschines had <lb/>
            previously hired himself to Philip, excuses his own apparent inconsis­ <lb/>
            tency by alleging that up to a certain time he, in common with the rest <lb/>
            of his fellow-citizens, had been deceived as to the defendant's motives. <lb/>
            He comments upon the remarkable change which Æschines had un­ <lb/>
            dergone in his political views: — he had been sent ambassador to Pelo­ <lb/>
            ponnesus, to rouse the Arcadians against Philip; he had made a <lb/>
            brilliant speech at Megalopolis, in which he assailed the king of <lb/>
            Macedon with the fiercest invective; he talked in the same strain <lb/>
            when he returned to Athens, and boasted of what he had done; he <lb/>
            was appointed on that very account to be one of the ambassadors to <lb/>
            Pella, that he might be a check upon his colleagues, who were SUB­ <lb/>
            pected of being too favourable to Philip; yet, after all this, he was <lb/>
             <pb n="121"/>
            found suddenly acting in concert with Philocrates, and doing every <lb/>
            thing to secure Philip's advantage in the negotiations. Among other <lb/>
            circumstances, prominently advanced as evidence of guilt, are-the <lb/>
            time which the ambassadors wasted on their journey to Pella, in dis­ <lb/>
            obedience to the decree of the council; their lingering afterwards at <lb/>
            Pella, until Philip returned from Thrace; their consenting to accom­ <lb/>
            pany him to Pheræ, and postponing the signature of the treaty until <lb/>
            their arrival at that city. By all this delay Philip was enabled to <lb/>
            reduce Thrace into subjection, and complete the preparations for his <lb/>
            march southward. It was the duty of the ambassadors to apprise <lb/>
            their countrymen of Philip's preparations and objects; yet not only <lb/>
            bad they neglected to do so themselves, but they refused to permit <lb/>
            a letter, which Demosthenes had written for that purpose, to be sent <lb/>
            to Athens. Philip had sent a letter to the Athenians, apologising <lb/>
            for their delay: this, says Demosthenes, was an argument that they <lb/>
            were colluding with him, and it was plain that Æschines had dictated <lb/>
            the letter.</p>
          <p>Æschines had had many private interviews with Philip, and on one <lb/>
            particular occasion, at Pheræ,—of this Demosthenes gives evidence, <lb/>
            -he had been watched coming out of the king's tent at midnight. <lb/>
            It is further asserted by Demosthenes, that on the first embassy Philip <lb/>
            offered a sum of money to the whole body of the ambassadors; that <lb/>
            he also sounded them each separately, himself among the rest, with a <lb/>
            view to seduce them from their allegiance. Æschines was known to <lb/>
            have received land in Phocis, yielding an income of thirty minas; (this <lb/>
            apparently is not denied by Æschines;) it could not be doubted that <lb/>
            this was the price of corruption. The conduct of Æschines after his <lb/>
            return home could only be explained on the supposition of treachery. <lb/>
            He professed to be perfectly acquainted with Philip's intentions; he <lb/>
            assured the people that Philip meant to deprive the Thebans of their <lb/>
            sovereignty in Boeotia, and to punish them for their designs upon <lb/>
            Delphi; to restore Thespiæ and Platæa, and to give Euboea and <lb/>
            Oropus to Athens. Afterwards, when it turned out that these pro­ <lb/>
            mises were nugatory-when Philip had destroyed the Phocian cities, <lb/>
            and confirmed Thebes in her sovereignty over Bœotia—how had <lb/>
            Æschines acted ? Instead of denouncing Philip for breach of faith, <lb/>
            -which would have been the natural course if he had been him­ <lb/>
            self deceived by Philip,-he remained quite silent: and not only <lb/>
            that; he had gone to Phocis, and shared the festivities of Philip's <lb/>
            camp, and continued ever after to sound his praises at Athens. N ot <lb/>
            very long ago he bad supported the Macedonian envoys before the <lb/>
            popular assembly, and, to gratify them, had spoken disparagingly of <lb/>
            his own countrymen. He had throughout assisted and upheld Philo­ <lb/>
            crates, clearly because he was the partner of his treason, and had been <lb/>
            afraid to disclaim connexion with him, lest his royal master should <lb/>
            be displeased.</p>
          <p>Such are the principal matters of fact adduced by Demosthenes in sup­ <lb/>
            port of the charge. Many stories are told, not bearing directly upon <lb/>
            the case, but tending to throw discredit on the character of the de­ <lb/>
            fendant and his supposed accomplices, Philocrates and Phrynon. <lb/>
            Great pains also are taken by the orator to explain the part which he <lb/>
             <pb n="122"/>
            himself took in the same transactions, with a view to clear himself <lb/>
            from all imputation of connexion with the guilty parties, or any <lb/>
            other share of the blame. His anxiety on this head rendered it more <lb/>
            difficult for him to confine himself to the question properly at issue ; <lb/>
            and the speech has not that clear order and arrangement which is com­ <lb/>
            monly observable in Demosthenes. The arguments indeed are often <lb/>
            pointed and forcible, but they are not well put together. He dwells <lb/>
            with much emphasis on the destruction of the Phocians, on the evil <lb/>
            consequences resulting from Philip's possession of Thermopylae, and <lb/>
            the great extension of his power; all which are attributed to Æschines <lb/>
            and his colleagues. If, after they had discovered the designs of Philip, <lb/>
            they had given immediate information to the Athenians, there was <lb/>
            plenty of time to send a fleet and army to Thermopylae, and prevent <lb/>
            his passing the straits: even after he had passed, they might have <lb/>
            saved Phocis, if they had not been prevented by false intelligence and <lb/>
            insidious counsels. The men who had thus deceived their country­ <lb/>
            men had been hired to betray a sacred trust, and they ought not to <lb/>
            be spared. It was urged, that their punishment would excite the <lb/>
            resentment of Philip: but, says Demosthenes, they deserved punish­ <lb/>
            ment on this very account, that they had made Philip's resentment <lb/>
            a thing to be dreaded; and Philip should be made to see that it <lb/>
            would not answer his purpose to bribe the citizens of Athens. He <lb/>
            reminds the jury how severely Timarchus had been dealt with, and <lb/>
            how Machines had in his case insisted upon general notoriety as <lb/>
            a sufficient ground of conviction: if they tried AEschines upon his <lb/>
            own principles, they must convict him, for his guilt was known to <lb/>
            all. He comments at great length upon the general increase of cor­ <lb/>
            ruption in the Greek states, showing what baneful effects it had <lb/>
            produced in Chalcidice, Peloponnesus, and elsewhere, and how perilous <lb/>
            it would be to themselves, if they suffered it to spread yet further. <lb/>
            Strong measures should *be taken to check the progress of the mis­ <lb/>
            chief; and now that Æschines was brought before them on a clear <lb/>
            charge of treason, they should, without regard to his abilities, his <lb/>
            position, or his party, make a signal example of him, and strike terror <lb/>
            into the host of traitors in the Hellenic world.</p>
          <p>Machines replied, in a speech little, if at all, inferior to that of his <lb/>
            adversary; and, as we are informed by Idomeneus the Epicurean, he <lb/>
            was acquitted by a majority of thirty votes. Nor can this surprise <lb/>
            us, when we look at the circumstances of the case- the length of <lb/>
            time which had elapsed-the lack of any direct proof of criminality <lb/>
            — the able defence made by Æschines—the advantage which he had <lb/>
            gained by the conviction of Timarchus—and the powerful aid of <lb/>
            Eubulus and other friends, who appeared in his behalf, or supported <lb/>
            him by their influence.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding the express testimony of Idomeneus, who wrote not <lb/>
            very long after the event, and who is confirmed by Ulpian, there are <lb/>
            writers, both ancient and modem, who have inclined to the opinion <lb/>
            that Æschines was never brought to trial, but the orations on both <lb/>
            sides were only published. The doubt was first suggested by Plutarch, <lb/>
            who thought it strange that no mention of this trial should be made <lb/>
            in either of the speeches on the Crown. The same view is espoused <lb/>
             <pb n="123"/>
            by Albert Gerhard Becker, in his treatise on the character of Demo­ <lb/>
            sthenes, (Demosthenes als Staatsman und Redner, p. 320,) who argues <lb/>
            the matter more fully. It appears to me, that the negative evidence <lb/>
            on which they rely has but little force under the circumstances, for <lb/>
            the reason assigned by Auger, (which Becker does not satisfactorily <lb/>
            answer,) viz. that both the orators had motives for their silence: <lb/>
            Demosthenes had lost the verdict, and therefore had nothing to boast <lb/>
            of; Æschines had so small a majority-the whole number of jurors <lb/>
            being not less probably than five hundred-that he was considered <lb/>
            not to have obtained an honourable acquittal.</p>
          <p>As to the title to this oration, and further information as to the law, see <lb/>
            my article Parapresbeia in the Archaeological Dictionary.</p>
          <p>OF the intrigue and canvassing which there has been about <lb/>
            this trial, men of Athens, I imagine you are all aware, having <lb/>
            seen what a throng assailed you at the ballot just now.1 I <lb/>
            shall only ask at your hands—what those who don't ask it <lb/>
            are entitled to-that you will value no person and no one's <lb/>
            favour more highly than justice and the oath which each <lb/>
            juror has sworn, remembering that this is for the good of <lb/>
            yourselves and the community; whereas all this intrigue and <lb/>
            importunity of partisans is to get advantages for some persons <lb/>
            over the rest, which the laws assemble you here to prevent, <lb/>
            not to secure for the benefit of the unjust.</p>
          <p>Other men, who enter honestly upon the service of the <lb/>
            public, even after their audit, I see, profess a continued <lb/>
            responsibility : Æschines does the very reverse; for before he <lb/>
            appeared in court to give a reckoning of his actions, one of <lb/>
            the persons who came to demand it he has removed out of <lb/>
            the way ;2 others he goes about threatening, and thus intro­ <lb/>
            duces into the commonwealth a practice most flagitious and <lb/>
            injurious to you; for if a man who has discharged or ad­ <lb/>
            ministered any public office can by intimidation, and not by <lb/>
            honesty, keep people from accusing him, you will be deprived <lb/>
            of all authority.</p>
          <p>That I shall prove the defendant to be guilty of many <lb/>
            five misdemeanours, and to merit the severest punishment, <lb/>
            am confident and persuaded: what, notwithstanding such <lb/>
            conviction, I am afraid of, I will tell you without disguise. <lb/>
            It appears to me, 0 Athenians, that all the causes which come <lb/>
            before you depend on the time of bringing them as much as <note type="footnote"> 1 For the election of jurors. See page 81, note 1. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Timarchus. See Appendix II. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="124"/>
            upon the merits, and I fear, the length of time since the <lb/>
            embassy may have caused you to forget or become reconciled <lb/>
            to your wrongs. Yet, even under these circumstances, you <lb/>
            may, I think, arrive at a correct judgment and decision: I <lb/>
            will tell you how. You must consider among yourselves, <lb/>
            men of the jury, and reflect for what things the common­ <lb/>
            wealth should receive an account from an ambassador. First <lb/>
            it should be, on the subject of his reports; secondly, of his <lb/>
            counsels; thirdly, of your instructions to him; next, as to <lb/>
            the circumstances of time; and after all, whether in each of <lb/>
            these points he has acted incorruptly or not. Why these in­ <lb/>
            quiries ? Because, from his reports you have to deliberate on <lb/>
            your course of action; if they are true, you determine rightly, <lb/>
            if not so, otherwise. The advice of ambassadors you give <lb/>
            more credit to, because you listen to them as to men who <lb/>
            understand what they were sent about: never then ought <lb/>
            an ambassador to be convicted of giving bad or mischievous <lb/>
            advice. And of course, whatever you instructed him either <lb/>
            to do or say, whatever commission you expressly gave him, it <lb/>
            is his duty to have executed. But why the account of time? <lb/>
            Because it often happens, men of Athens, that the season for <lb/>
            many important measures falls in a short space, and if it be <lb/>
            sacrificed and betrayed to the enemy, do what you will, it <lb/>
            cannot be recalled. As to the absence of corrupt motive- <lb/>
            I am sure you will all agree, that to take reward for acts <lb/>
            which injure the commonwealth is shocking and abomi­ <lb/>
            nable. The legislator indeed does not define it so, but abso­ <lb/>
            lutely forbids the taking of bribes in any way, considering, as <lb/>
            it appears to me, that a person who is once bribed and cor­ <lb/>
            rupted ceases to be even a safe judge of what is useful for <lb/>
            the state. If then I shall prove and demonstrate clearly, <lb/>
            that AEschines the defendant has reported what was untrue, <lb/>
            and prevented the people hearing the truth from me—that <lb/>
            he has given advice totally opposed to your interests, and <lb/>
            fulfilled none of your instructions on the embassy-that he <lb/>
            has wasted time in which many important opportunities have <lb/>
            been lost to the commonwealth-and that for all this he has <lb/>
            received presents and wages in conjnuction with Philocrates, <lb/>
            -convict him, punish him as his crimes deserve: if I prove <lb/>
            not these statements, or not all of them, look with contempt <lb/>
            on me, and acquit the defendant.</p><pb n="125"/>
            
          <p>Many grievous things can I lay to his charge besides those <lb/>
            which I have mentioned, 0 Athenians—enough to make <lb/>
            every one detest him—but before I enter upon other topics, <lb/>
            I will remind you (though nearly all indeed must remember) <lb/>
            what character Æschines first assumed in politics, and what <lb/>
            language he thought proper to address to the people against <lb/>
            Philip, that you may see, his own early acts and speeches will <lb/>
            most surely convict him of taking bribes.</p>
          <p>He is the first Athenian (as he declared in his speech) who <lb/>
            discovered that Philip was plotting against the Greeks, and <lb/>
            corrupting certain of the leading men in Arcadia. He it is <lb/>
            who, having Ischander, son of Neoptolemus, to play second <lb/>
            part to him,1 applied to the council on this matter, and also <lb/>

            where to assemble a congress at Athens for consulting about <lb/>
            war with Philip; who afterwards, on his return from Arcadia, <lb/>
            reported those fine long speeches, which he said he had de­ <lb/>
            livered on your behalf before the ten thousand at Megalo­ <lb/>
            polis,2 in answer to Philip's advocate Hieronymus, and dwelt <lb/>
            on the enormous injury done, not only to their own countries, <lb/>
            but to the whole of Greece, by the men who took presents <lb/>
            and money from Philip. Such being his politics then, such <lb/>
            the specimen which he had given of himself, when Aristo­ <lb/>
            demus, Neoptolemus, Ctesiphon, and the rest, who brought <lb/>
            reports from Macedonia without a word of truth, prevailed <lb/>
            on you to send ambassadors to Philip for peace, this man is <lb/>
            put into the embassy, not as one of a party who would sell <lb/>
            your interests, not as one of those who trusted Philip, but as <lb/>
            one who would help to watch the others; for, on account of <lb/>
            his former speeches and hostility to Philip, you all naturally <lb/>
            held that opinion of him. He came then to me, and arranged <lb/>
            that we should act in the embassy together; and strongly <note type="footnote"> 1 Pabst: indem er dem Ischander dem Sohne des Neoptolemus die <lb/>

            Philocrates. And until his return home from the first em­ <lb/>
            bassy, men of Athens, I certainly never discovered that he was <lb/>
            corrupted and had sold himself; for, besides the speeches <lb/>
            which, as I said, he had made before, he rose in the first of <lb/>
            the assemblies in which you debated on the peace, and began <lb/>
            —I think I can repeat his opening to you in the very same <lb/>
            words which he used—“Had Philocrates been meditating <lb/>
            ever so long, men of Athens, upon the best means of opposing <lb/>
            the peace, he could not, methinks, have found a better way <lb/>
            than a motion like the present. Never will I, while a single <lb/>
            Athenian is left, advise the commonwealth to make a peace <lb/>
            like this : peace, however, I do advise "--and to such purport <lb/>
            briefly and fairly he expressed himself Yet the same man <lb/>
            who had thus spoken on the first day in the hearing of you <lb/>
            all, on the next, when the peace was to be ratified, when I <lb/>
            supported the resolution of our allies, and exerted myself to <lb/>
            make the peace equitable and just, and you were of my <lb/>
            opinion, and would not even hear the voice of the despicable <lb/>
            Philocrates,—he then got up and addressed the people in <lb/>
            support of Philocrates, and said what (0 heavens!) deserved <lb/>
            a thousand deaths-that you ought not to remember your <lb/>
            ancestors, nor put up with persons who talked about trophies <lb/>
            and sea-fights, and that he would propose and pass a law to <lb/>
            prevent your succouring any Greeks who had not previously <lb/>
            succoured you. All which this impudent wretch dared to <lb/>
            utter in the presence and hearing of the ambassadors, whom <lb/>
            you sent for out of Greece at his persuasion before he had <lb/>
            sold himself.</p>
          <p>How he wasted the time, 0 Athenians, after you had <lb/>
            appointed him again to receive the oaths; how he ruined all <lb/>

            about it when I sought to prevent him, you shall hear pre­ <lb/>
            sently. But when' we had returned from that embassy for <lb/>
            the oaths, which is the subject of your present inquiry—we <lb/>
            not having obtained a particle, great or small, of what was <lb/>
            promised and expected when you made the peace, but having <lb/>
            been cheated in everything, and these men having a second <note type="footnote"> 1 Auger’s turn of the passage is a good one : “ ecoutez auparavant ce <lb/>

            time outstepped their duty as ambassadors, and neglected <lb/>
            your orders—we went before the council. What I am about <lb/>
            to say is known to many people; for the council-hall was full <lb/>
            of strangers.1 I came forward and reported the whole truth <lb/>
            to the council, and accused these men, and reckoned every­ <lb/>
            thing up, beginning with those first hopes which Ctesiphon and <lb/>
            Aristodemus brought you, showing what speeches Æschines <lb/>
            had made at the time of your concluding peace, and into <lb/>
            what position they had brought the commonwealth; and as <lb/>
            to what remained, that is, the Phocians and Thermopylae, I <lb/>
            advised that we should not sacrifice them and repeat our <lb/>
            errors, not keep hanging on hopes and promises, till we let <lb/>
            things come to an extremity. And so I persuaded the council. <lb/>
            But when the assembly came, and we had to address you, <lb/>
            Æschines advanced before any of us: and do, I entreat you, <lb/>
            try and recollect, as I go on, whether I am telling the truth; <lb/>
            for what marred and utterly ruined all our affairs is just this. <lb/>
            From any report of our proceedings on the embassy, from <lb/>
            any mention of what was said in the council, whether or <lb/>
            no he disputed the truth of my statements, he altogether <lb/>
            abstained; but told a tale promising such mighty advan­ <lb/>
            tages, that he carried you all away with him. He said that <lb/>
            he had brought Philip entirely over to the interests of Athens, <lb/>
            both on Amphictyonic questions and all others; and he went <lb/>
            through a long speech, which he said he had addressed to <lb/>
            Philip against the Thebans, and repeated to you the heads, <lb/>
            and computed that in two or three days (thanks to his own <lb/>
            diplomacy) you would hear without leaving home or having <lb/>
            any field-service or trouble, that Thebes, alone and separately <lb/>
            from the rest of Bœotia, was besieged, that Thespiæ and <lb/>
            Platæa were having their people restored, and the treasures of <lb/>
            the God were demanded not from the Phocians, but from the <lb/>
            Thebans, who had formed the design of seizing his temple; <lb/>
            for he had taught Philip, he said, that those who designed <lb/>
            were guilty of as much impiety as those who executed; and <lb/>
            on that account the Thebans had set a price upon his head. <lb/>
            He declared further, he had heard some of the Eubœans, who <lb/>
            were frightened and alarmed at the connexion of our state <note type="footnote"> 1 I. e. people not councillors. As Thirlwall expresses it, (Gr. Hist. <lb/>

            with Philip, say to the ambassadors, “We are not unaware of <lb/>
            the terms on which you have concluded peace with Philip; <lb/>
            we are not ignorant, that you have given Amphipolis to him, <lb/>
            and Philip has agreed to surrender Eubœa to you:" there <lb/>
            was indeed another thing which he had arranged, but he <lb/>
            would not mention it yet awhile; for some of his colleagues <lb/>
            were jealous of him—hinting in obscure words at Oropus. <lb/>
            Exalted in your opinion by this plausible tale, judged to be <lb/>
            a consummate orator and a wonderful man, he quitted the <lb/>
            platform with much solemnity. I rose, and declared that I <lb/>
            knew none of those things, and was proceeding to tell what <lb/>
            I had reported to the council; but the defendant standing <lb/>
            up on one side, and Philocrates on the other, shouted and <lb/>
            clamoured me down, and at last mocked me. You laughed, <lb/>
            and would neither hear nor believe anything but what <lb/>
            Æschines had reported. And, by the Gods! I think your <lb/>
            behaviour was not unnatural; for who could have endured, <lb/>
            with such splendid prospects of advantage, to hear any one <lb/>
            say they were delusive, or arraign what these men had done ? <lb/>
            Everything else, I fancy, at that time was secondary to the <lb/>
            hopes and prospects before you; opposition looked like spite <lb/>
            and annoyance merely ;1 the results achieved for the country <lb/>
            were so marvellously advantageous, as it seemed.</p>
          <p>Why have I begun by reminding you of these things, and <lb/>
            going over these speeches? Chiefly and principally, men of <lb/>
            Athens, for this reason, that when you hear me speak of any <lb/>
            proceeding, and it appears outrageously bad, you may not cry <lb/>
            in astonishment, “ Why didn't you speak at the moment, and <lb/>
            inform us ?”but remembering the promises of these men, by <lb/>
            means of which on every occasion they prevented others from <lb/>
            being heard, and also that specious announcement of AEschines, <lb/>
            you may see that he has injured you in this way among <lb/>
            others, because you were not suffered to learn the truth at <note type="footnote"> I I do not agree with Schaefer, in thinking that <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἱ δ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀντιλέγοντες <lb/>

            .the instant when it was needful, but cheated by hopes and im­ <lb/>
            postures and promises. Such was the chief and principal cause <lb/>
            of my entering into these details. What was the second ? One <lb/>
            of no less importance; that, while you remember his political <lb/>
            principles before he was corrupted,-how wary, how mistrust­ <lb/>
            ful he was of Philip,—you may observe his sudden conversion <lb/>
            to confidence and friendship ; and if his reports to you have <lb/>
            been verified, and the results are all right, you may hold his <lb/>
            conversion to have been honest and for the country's good; <lb/>
            but if the events have all been contrary to what he said, and <lb/>
            are fraught with deep disgrace and grievous peril to the <lb/>
            country, you may see that he has changed from sordid avarice <lb/>
            and bartering of the truth for money.</p>
          <p>As I have been led into these topics, I would take the <lb/>
            earliest opportunity of mentioning how they took the Phocian <lb/>
            business out of your hands. And you must not suppose, <lb/>
            men of the jury, when you look at the magnitude of that <lb/>
            affair, that the crimes and charges imputed to AEschines are <lb/>
            too great for his character, but consider, that any person <lb/>
            whom you had placed in that position and made the arbiter <lb/>
            of events, had he sold himself, like Æschines, for the purpose <lb/>
            of cheating and deceiving you, would have wrought the same <lb/>
            mischief as Æschines. It is not because you often put mena <lb/>
            persons in public employments, that the affairs which other <lb/>
            people deem our state worthy to administer are mean ; quite <lb/>
            otherwise. And again-Philip, I grant, has destroyed the <lb/>
            Phocians; but these men helped him: and we must look and <lb/>
            see, whether such chance of saving the Phocians as depended <lb/>
            on the embassy was sacrificed and lost by the treachery of <lb/>
            these men; not that Æschines1 destroyed the Phocians by <lb/>
            himself-how could he ?</p>
          <p>Give me the resolution which the council passed on my <lb/>
            report, and the deposition of the person who drew it up <lb/>
            -to show you, I am not repudiating acts which I was <lb/>
            silent about before, for I denounced them immediately, and <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ὄδε</foreign> means Æschines, as Reiske, Auger, and Pabst take it; not <lb/>
            Philip, as Schaefer and Francis. The argument is—It is not necessary <lb/>
            to make out, for the purpose of conviction, that Æschines was the sole <lb/>
            destroyer of the Phocians; of course he was not, and could not be. <lb/>
            Philip was the principal author of that result. The question is, whether <lb/>
            Æschines and his accomplices did not help to bring it about by their <lb/>
            treacherous conduct in the embassy. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> K </note> <lb/>

            foresaw the consequences; and the council, who were not pre­ <lb/>
            vented hearing the truth from me, would neither vote thanks <lb/>
            to these men, nor invite them to the city-hall.' Such an <lb/>
            indignity is not known to have befallen any ambassadors <lb/>
            since the foundation of the city, not even Timagoras,2 whom <lb/>
            the people condemned to death: yet it has been suffered by <lb/>
            these men.</p>

          <p>Here is no vote of thanks, no invitation of the ambassadors <lb/>
            by the council to the city-hall. If Æschines says there is, let <lb/>
            him show and produce it, and I will sit down. But there is <lb/>
            none. I allow, if we all acted alike in the embassy, the <note type="footnote"> 1 The Prytaneum, or town-hall of Athens. This was a public building <lb/>
            near the market-place, where the Prytanes, or presidents of the council, <lb/>
            met to dine every day during their term of office, in company with <lb/>
            a few select citizens, to whom the state gave the honour of a public <lb/>
            dinner. This honour was sometimes given for life, to men who had <lb/>
            done some signal service, or to the children of such persons; but it was <lb/>
            a reward reserved for rare occasions. Hence the Athenians were so <lb/>
            incensed with Socrates, when, being asked after his conviction what <lb/>
            penalty he deserved, he replied, “ Dinner in the Prytaneum." Cicero <lb/>
            de Oratore, i. 54—" Respondit sese meruisse ut amplissimis honoribus <lb/>
            et præmiis decoraretur, et ei victus quotidianus in Prytaneo publioe <lb/>

            sic judices exarserunt, ut capitis hominem innocentissimum condem­ <lb/>
            narent." Here also the presidents, representing the hospitality of the <lb/>
            state, entertained ambassadors and other foreigners of distinction. And <lb/>
            it appears from this passage of Demosthenes, that it was usual to invite <lb/>
            the Athenian ambassadors after their return home, unless they had mis­ <lb/>
            conducted themselves, and the omission to give such invitation would <lb/>
            be regarded as a stigma. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Timagoras and Leon were the Athenian ambassadors to the court <lb/>
            of Persia, at the same time when the Thebans and their allies sent <lb/>
            a joint embassy with Pelopidas at their head, B.C. 367. According to <lb/>
            Xenophon, (Hell. vii. 38,) Leon, upon his return to Athens, accused <lb/>
            Timagoras of having refused to lodge with him, and having acted in <lb/>
            concert with Pelopidas; and the Athenians for this put him to death. <lb/>
            Plutarch, in the life of Pelopidas, relates that the Athenians condemned <lb/>
            Timagoras for receiving a large number of presents from Artaxerxes, <lb/>
            and travelling to the coast in a carriage provided by the king; though <lb/>
            the real cause of their displeasure was, that Pelopidas, by means of his <lb/>
            superior credit and abilities, had gained greater success than the <lb/>
            Athenian envoys. </note> <lb/>

            council did right in thanking none of us; for the conduct of <lb/>
            all was truly shameful: but if some of us acted uprightly <lb/>
            and some not, through the rogues, it would seem, honest men <lb/>
            have come in for a share of the disgrace. How then may <lb/>
            you easily distinguish who is the knave ? Recollect among <lb/>
            yourselves, who it is that denounced the proceedings from the <lb/>
            beginning: for it is clear that the guilty party was content <lb/>
            to be silent, to elude the present time, and never afterwards <lb/>
            submit his conduct to inquiry; while to a man conscious of <lb/>
            nothing wrong it occurred, that possibly by holding his <lb/>
            tongue he might seem to be an accomplice in misdemeanour <lb/>
            and crime. Well then, I am the person who accused these <lb/>
            men from the beginning; none of them accused me.</p>
          <p>The council had passed their resolution. The assembly <lb/>
            was convened, and Philip already at Thermopylae. This <lb/>
            indeed was their prime offence, that they gave the conduct of <lb/>
            such an affair to Philip, and when the proper course was, <lb/>
            that you should have information, and then deliberate, and <lb/>
            afterwards execute what you determined, you received in­ <lb/>
            telligence only at the moment of his arrival, and it was <lb/>
            difficult even to advise what should be done. And besides, <lb/>
            no one ever read to the people that resolution of the council; <lb/>
            the people never heard it; but AEschines got up and <lb/>
            harangued as I have just told you, stating what immense <lb/>
            advantages he had persuaded Philip to grant, and that the <lb/>
            Thebans on that account had set a price upon his head; at <lb/>
            which you, though terrified at first by Philip's arrival, and <lb/>
            angry with these men for having given no warning, became as <lb/>

            apology for these men's faults. For it states, that he hindered <lb/>
            them from going to the cities as they wished and receiving <lb/>
            the oaths, and that he kept them to assist him as mediators <lb/>
            between the Halians and Pharsalians ; and he adopts and <lb/>
            takes upon himself all their delinquencies: but as to; the <lb/>
            Phocians or Thespians, or the defendant's reports to you, <lb/>
            there is not a syllable. And it was not done in this way by <lb/>
            accident: but where you ought to have punished these men <lb/>
            for non-performance and neglect of your positive instructions, 1 <lb/>
            Philip takes the blame off their shoulders, and says that he <lb/>
            himself was in fault, because (as I imagine) you were not <lb/>
            likely to punish him: where he desired to cheat and surprise <lb/>
            us out of some advantage, Æschines made the report, that <lb/>
            you might have no charge or complaint against Philip after­ <lb/>
            wards, the statements not being in a letter or any other <lb/>
            communication of his. Read them the letter itself, which this <lb/>
            man wrote and Philip sent. You will see, it is just as I <lb/>
            explained. Read.</p>

          <p>You hear the letter, 0 Athenians—how fair and friendly it <lb/>
            is. About the Phocians however, or the Thebans, or the <lb/>
            other matters which this man reported, there is not a word: <lb/>
            and therefore there is nothing honest in it, as you shall see <lb/>
            directly. He kept them, as he says, to help him in making up <lb/>
            the quarrel of the Halians: but a pretty making-up the Halians <lb/>
            have got-they have been outcast, and their city has been <lb/>
            razed to the ground. As to the prisoners, this man who <lb/>
            was considering what he could do to oblige you says, he never <lb/>
            thought of ransoming them : but it has often, as you know, <lb/>
            been testified before the assembly, that I went with a talent <lb/>
            to redeem them, and it shall be testified now : therefore, to <lb/>
            deprive me of the credit of a generous act, Æschines per­ <lb/>

            “ I should have expressly mentioned what benefits I had in <lb/>

            alliance had been concluded says, he knows not what he can <lb/>
            do to oblige you ; he knows not even his own promise ! Of <lb/>
            course he knew that, if he was not playing false.1 To prove <lb/>
            that he wrote so at first-here, read the passage out of the <lb/>
            letter-begin here-read.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>You see, before he obtained peace, he promised, if alliance <lb/>
            also was granted him, he would write and say what benefits <lb/>
            he had in store for you. Now that both have been granted <lb/>
            him, he says he knows not what he can do to oblige you, <lb/>
            but, if you will tell him, he will do anything that is not <lb/>
            disgraceful or dishonourable; having recourse to these pre­ <note type="footnote"> it to be believed that the debates on the peace had raised such suspi­ <lb/>
            cions in his mind as to the integrity of his former colleagues, especially <lb/>
            Philocrates and Æschines, that he would have declined the office, if he <lb/>
            had not undertaken to procure the release of some of the Athenian <lb/>
            prisoners who were detained in Macedonia. Æschines treats this as an <lb/>
            empty pretext, because Philip had never been used to exact ransom for <lb/>
            his Athenian prisoners during the war; and a promise had been given <lb/>
            in his name that all should be released as soon as peace should be con­ <lb/>
            eluded. But it is clear that this related only to those whom he kept in <lb/>
            his own hands; and Æschines himself admits that, among the instruc­ <lb/>
            tions of the second embassy, one was to negotiate for the release of the <lb/>
            priaoners." </note><note type="footnote"> The distinction between <foreign xml:lang="grc">λῦσαι</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">λύσασθαι</foreign> is properly explained by <lb/>
            Schaefer; and the first part of the charge here made against Philip is <lb/>
            perfectly clear. Philip had said he was considering what service he could <lb/>
            render to the Athenians: and yet in his letter he states that he never <lb/>
            thought of redeeming the prisoners. How could this obvious method <lb/>
            of obliging them have escaped him, if be had really desired to do so ? <lb/>
            But what does Demosthenes mean when he says that Philip put that <lb/>
            clause in his letter, in order to deprive him of credit for his liberality 1 <lb/>
            We should have the whole letter before us, to understand this fully; <lb/>
            but perhaps the meaning of Philip was as follows: It did not occur to <lb/>
            me to redeem the prisoners who were in the hands of my subjects; the <lb/>
            moment it was suggested, however, I acceded to the request: there <lb/>
            could be no occasion for Demosthenes, or any one else, to come to Pella <lb/>
            for the purpose of effecting their ransom. Compare what Demo­ <lb/>
            sthenes says at pp. 393, 394, which looks like an answer to this very <lb/>
            argument. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 The <foreign xml:lang="grc">γὰρ</foreign> might be expressed more fully, thus-“a likely thing, <lb/>

            fences, and (should you mention anything and be induced to <lb/>
            make a proposal) leaving himself an escape.</p>
          <p>These and many other tricks one might then instantly <lb/>
            have exposed, and enlightened you on the subject, and not <lb/>
            permitted you to abandon everything, had not Thespiæ and <lb/>
            Platæa and the expectation of immediate punishment being <lb/>
            inflicted on Thebes blinded you to the truth. If these things <lb/>
            were merely to be heard, and the commonwealth to be <lb/>
            deluded, it was proper enough to tell you of them : but if <lb/>
            they were really to be performed, they should not have been <lb/>
            talked about. For if matters had gone so far, that the <lb/>
            Thebans even discovering the design could not have helped <lb/>
            themselves, why has it not been executed ? If they discovered <lb/>
            it in time to prevent the execution, who let out the secret ? <lb/>
            Was it not Æschines? But no-he never had any such <lb/>
            meaning or intention,1 and Æschines never expected it: so I <lb/>
            acquit him entirely of letting the secret out. The fact is­ <lb/>
            it was necessary that you should be amused by these state­ <lb/>
            ments, and refuse to hear the truth from me, and that you <lb/>
            should yourselves remain at home, and a decree pass by <lb/>
            which the Phocians would be destroyed. Therefore were these <lb/>
            statements fabricated, and therefore publicly announced.</p>
          <p>I, when I heard the defendant making such magnificent <lb/>
            promises, being quite certain of their falsehood-and I will <lb/>
            tell you why : first because, when Philip was about to <lb/>
            swear the oath of peace, the Phocians were by these men <lb/>
            expressly excluded from the treaty, a thing they should have <lb/>
            been quite silent about, if the Phocians were to be saved— <lb/>
            secondly, because Philip's ambassadors used no such language, <lb/>
            nor Philip's letter, but only the defendant.2 Making my <lb/>
            conjectures accordingly, I got up to speak, and attempted to <lb/>
            answer him; but, as you refused to hear me, I held my <lb/>
            tongue, protesting only—I pray and entreat you to recollect <lb/>
            -that I had no knowledge of these things, that I had no <note type="footnote"> 1 I follow Markland, Auger, and Pabst, in understanding Philip as <lb/>
            the nominative to <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἢμελλεν</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἠβουλήθη</foreign>. It is true that Philip has not <lb/>
            been mentioned in the sentences preceding; but then he was throughout <lb/>
            in the oratory thoughts as the party promising and designing the things <lb/>
            alluded to. Schaefer explains <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὔτ' ἤμελλεν</foreign>, " nee futura erant quæ fore <lb/>
            Æschines jactaverat;" and connects <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἠβουλήθη</foreign> with <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὗτος</foreign>. But there is <lb/>
            not much sense in saying that " Æschines never desired." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 I preserve the anacoluthon of the original. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="135"/>
            concern in them, and what was more, I did not expect them. <lb/>
            At this (the not expecting) you tired up. " Athenians," I <lb/>
            said, " if any of this comes true, be sure you praise and <lb/>
            honour and crown these men, and not me; but if it turns <lb/>
            out differently, let them feel your resentment. I am out of <lb/>
            it altogether." 1 “ Don't be out of it now," said Æschines, <lb/>
            interrupting-“Mind you don't want to be in it another <lb/>
            time." " Certainly," said I, " or I should be acting unfairly ;" <lb/>
            it which Philocrates rose in a flippant manner and said, <lb/>
            ‘ No wonder, men of Athens, that I and Demosthenes agree <lb/>
            not in opinion; for he drinks water, and I drink wine "2— <lb/>
            and you laughed.</p>
          <p>Read the decree, which Philocrates presented afterwards, <lb/>
            of his own drawing.3 It is very well just to hear : but when <lb/>
            one takes into account the occasion on which it was prepared, <lb/>
            and the promises which the defendant then made, it will <lb/>
            appear, they plainly delivered up the Phocians to Philip and <lb/>
            the Thebans, all but tying their hands behind them. Read <lb/>
            the decree.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>You see, men of Athens, how full the decree is of fair and <lb/>
            flattering words; that it extends the peace with Philip' to <lb/>
            his descendants, and the alliance, and awards praise to Philip <lb/>
            for offering to do what was just. But Philip offered nothing <lb/>
            at all-so far from offering, he says he knows not what he <lb/>
            can do to oblige you : it was the defendant that spoke and <note type="footnote"> 1 it I wash my hands of it," as we familiarly say. " I disclaim all <lb/>
            connexion with the business; (that is) with what Æschines has been <lb/>
            telling you." The reply of Æschines might be rendered with equal <lb/>
            force, but with a turn of expression, thus—“ Don't disclaim connexion <lb/>
            now and claim it hereafter." Pabst: Ich für meinen Theil sage mich <lb/>
            los von der ganzen Sache! Hierauf sprach dieser Æschines: sage <lb/>
            Dich jetzt nicht los davon, und siehe zu, dass Du micAt hernach faran <lb/>
            Aitheil wirst haben wollen. Francis, without either force or accuracy : <lb/>
            " For my part I retire. Not yet, replied Æschines: do not yet retire: <lb/>
            only remember not to claim any of these rewards, when they are <lb/>
            distributed." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Demosthenes was often joked about his water-drinking. Thus, in <lb/>
            allusion to the Clepsydra (as to which, see page 69, note 1), it was said, <lb/>
            that other men spoke by water, but Demosthenes composed by it. </note><note type="footnote"> a Philocrates had drawn it up, and then put it in the hands of the <lb/>

            promised in his name. Philocrates, seeing you jump at the <lb/>
            defendant's promise,1 inserts in the decree, that, unless the <lb/>
            Phocians did what was right and gave up the temple to the <lb/>
            Amphictyons, the Athenian people would send forces against <lb/>
            those who resisted. So, men of Athens, as you were staying <lb/>
            at home and had never been out, as the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            seeing the artifice had withdrawn, and no other Amphictyons <lb/>
            were present besides Thessalians and Thebans, he has proposed! <lb/>
            in the blandest possible language to deliver up the temple to <lb/>
            them, proposing (as he does) to deliver it up to the Amphic­ <lb/>
            tyons—what Amphictyons ? for none were there but Thebans <lb/>
            and Thessalians—not that you should convoke the Amphic­ <lb/>
            tyonic body, or wait till they assembled ; not that Proxenus <lb/>
            should carry succour to the Phocians, or that the Athenians <lb/>
            should take the field, or anything of the kind. Philip however <lb/>
            twice summoned you by letter-not to induce you to march, <lb/>
            most assuredly : or he would never have destroyed your op­ <lb/>
            portunities of marching and summoned you then; he would not <lb/>
            have prevented my sailing home when I desired it, or ordered <lb/>
            AEschines to make statements calculated to stop your march : <lb/>
            no-it was that you, under the belief that he would do all <lb/>
            you desired, might vote nothing against him; that the Pho­ <lb/>
            cians might not be encouraged by hopes from you to hold out <lb/>
            and resist, but might in utter despair surrender themselves <lb/>
            into his hands. Read Philip's letters, and let them speak for <lb/>

          <p>You see, the letters summon you, and verily for the first <lb/>

            it-ought surely to have pressed for your going out,<unclear>3</unclear> and <lb/>
            moved that Proxenus, whom they knew to be in the neigh­ <lb/>
            bourhood, should immediately carry succour. Yet it appears, <lb/>
            they have done just the contrary: and no wonder. They heeded <lb/>
            not his epistles, for they understood his intentions in writing <lb/>
            them : those intentions they seconded and strove to forward. <note type="footnote"> 1 Pabst: der Euch dUTch die Reden des Æschines angelockt sah. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This tense is used because the decree, which Demosthenes had <lb/>

          <p>The Phocians, when they learned your views from the <lb/>

            the defendants report and his promises, were in every way <lb/>
            undone. Consider only. There were some intelligent persons <lb/>
            there who distrusted Philip : they were induced to put faith <lb/>
            in him—why?—because they supposed that, if Philip de­ <lb/>
            ceived them ten times over, he would at all events not dare <lb/>
            to deceive the Athenian envoys, but that the defendant's <lb/>
            reports to you were correct, and destruction menaced the <lb/>
            Thebans, not themselves. There were others inclined to <lb/>
            resist at any price : but even their zeal was slackened by the <lb/>
            persuasion that Philip was on their side, and that, if they <lb/>
            refused compliance, you would attack them, you from whom <lb/>
            they had expected succour. Some however believed, that you <lb/>
            repented having made peace with Philip : to these they <lb/>
            showed, that you had voted the same peace with his posterity, <lb/>
            so that all hope from you must have been despaired of. <lb/>
            Therefore they got all this into one decree. And here, in my <lb/>
            opinion, have they done you the most grievous wrong. In <lb/>
            drawing a treaty of peace with a mortal man raised to power <lb/>
            by certain accidents, to have covenanted for an immortality <lb/>
            of disgrace to the commonwealth!–to have deprived her not <lb/>
            merely of other things, but also of the chances of fortune !— <lb/>
            to have been so wantonly wicked as to injure not only the <lb/>
            existing Athenians, but all hereafter to come in being!2–is <lb/>
            not this most dreadful ? Never afterwards would you have <lb/>
            consented to add to the treaty this clause, " and to his <note type="footnote"> 1 is They got intelligence about you from the proceedings in the <lb/>

            among the Greeks to conclude a peace for a limited number of years; <lb/>
            and when for a small term, it was little better than an armistice. (See <lb/>
            Thucydides, v. 18, 23, 41; Aristophanes, Acharn. 186—202, 251.) The <lb/>
            argument of Demosthenes is good, assuming the peace with Philip to <lb/>
            hare been a dishonourable and injurious one. Had the peace been satis­ <lb/>

            posterity," had you not relied on the promises announced by <lb/>
            AEschines. On these the Phocians relied, and were ruined : <lb/>
            for, after they had surrendered to Philip and put their cities <lb/>
            into his hands, they met with treatment the very opposite of <lb/>
            what he assured them.</p>
          <p>To convince you that all has been lost in this manner <lb/>
            and through these men, I will compute to you the dates of the <lb/>
            several transactions. Whoever disputes any of these par­ <lb/>
            ticulars, may get up and speak whilst my water is running. <lb/>
            The peace was concluded on the nineteenth of Elaphebolion, <lb/>
            and we were away to receive the oaths three whole months; <lb/>
            and during all that time the Phocians were safe. We returned <lb/>
            from the embassy for the oaths on the thirteenth of the <lb/>
            month Scirophorion, and Philip was by that time at Ther­ <lb/>
            mopylæ, and making promises to the Phocians, of which <lb/>
            they believed not a single word. The proof is this;-they <lb/>
            would not otherwise have come here to you. The assembly, in <lb/>
            which these men ruined all by their false and delusive state­ <lb/>
            ments to you, was held afterwards, on the sixteenth of Sciro­ <lb/>
            phorion. On the fifth day after that, as I reckon, intelligence <lb/>
            of your proceedings reached the Phocians; for the Phocian <lb/>
            envoys were here, and it much concerned them to know what <lb/>
            these men would report, and what resolution you would pass. <lb/>
            I reckon then, it was on the twentieth that the Phocians <lb/>
            heard of your proceedings, for that is the fifth day from the <lb/>
            sixteenth.1 Then comes the twenty-first, twenty-second, <lb/>
            twenty-third: on this the convention 2 took place, and it was <lb/>
            all over with Phocis. How does this appear ? On the twenty- <lb/>
            seventh you were assembled in Piræus on the business of the <lb/>
            arsenal, and Dercylus came from Chalets, and reported to you <lb/>
            that Philip had put everything into the hands of the Thebans; <lb/>
            and he computed it to be the fifth day from the convention. <lb/>
            Twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-six, twenty- <lb/>
            seven -that makes it exactly the fifth. So, you see, by the <lb/>
            date of their report, by the date of their motion, by all the <lb/>
            dates,3 are they convicted of having acted in concert with <lb/>
            Philip, and assisted in the destruction of the Phocians. <note type="footnote"> 1 Reckoning inclusive, according to custom. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Between Philip and the Phocians.

            stroyed by the convention, is a decisive proof that they suffered <lb/>

            this kind.</p>
          <p>The ruin which has fallen on the poor Phocians may be <lb/>
            seen not only by these decrees, but by what has actually been <lb/>
            done-a shocking and pitiable spectacle, 0 Athenians! On <lb/>
            our late journey to Delphi1 we were forced to see it all­ <lb/>
            houses razed to the ground, walls demolished, a country <lb/>
            stripped of its adult population, a few women and little chil­ <lb/>
            dren and miserable old men. No language can come up to <lb/>
            the wretchedness now existing there. I hear you all say, <lb/>
            that once this people gave the opposite vote to the Thebans on <lb/>
            the question of enslaving us.' How think ye then, 0 Athe­ <lb/>
            nians?—could your ancestors return to life, what vote or <lb/>
            judgment would they pass upon the authors of this destruc­ <lb/>
            tion ? In my opinion, though they stoned them with their <lb/>
            own hands, they would consider themselves pure. For is it <lb/>
            not disgraceful-is it not, if possible, worse than disgraceful <lb/>
            -that people who had then saved us, who gave the vote for <lb/>
            our preservation, should have met with an opposite return <lb/>
            through these men, and been suffered to incur greater mis­ <lb/>
            fortunes than any Greeks ever knew? Who then is the <lb/>
            author of them? Who was the deceiver? Æschines—who <lb/>
            but he?</p>
          <p>For many things, men of Athens, might one felicitate <lb/>
            Philip on his fortune, but for one thing with the greatest <lb/>
            justice-one piece of luck which (by the gods and goddesses!) <lb/>
            I don't think has fallen to any other man in our time. To <lb/>
            have taken great cities and subdued a large territory, these <lb/>
            and the like feats are wonderful, I allow, and splendid­ <lb/>
            how can they help being? Yet they have been achieved, it <lb/>
            may be said, by many others. This however is a peculiar <lb/>
            good fortune which has occurred to no other mortal-what? <lb/>
            -That, when he wanted base men for his purposes, he found <lb/>
            baser than he desired. Can we avoid holding such an opinion <lb/>
            of these men, when falsehoods which Philip dared not utter in <lb/>

            was not well acquainted with it: for, as your clerk and servant <lb/>
            to the council, he himself dictated this law to the crier. <lb/>
            Would it not be a strange and monstrous proceeding, if what <lb/>
            you enjoin, or rather request the gods to. do in your behalf, <lb/>
            you should fail to do yourselves when it is in your power to- <lb/>

            When a man escapes you, leave the gods to punish him: <lb/>
            when you catch him yourselves, trouble them about him <lb/>
            no more.</p>
          <p>So far will he carry his impudence and audacity, I am told, <lb/>
            that, leaving the facts of the case, his reports, his promises, his <lb/>
            impostures upon the state, as if he were tried before some <lb/>
            other people, and not before you who know it all, he will ac­ <lb/>
            cuse first the Lacedæmonians, then the Phocians, then Hege­ <lb/>
            sippus. But this is mockery, or rather abominable effrontery. <lb/>
            For, whatever he may say now about the Phocians or the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians or Hegesippus—that they would not receive <lb/>
            Proxenus, that they are guilty of impiety, or anything else <lb/>
            against them-surely it had all taken place before these am­ <lb/>
            bassadors returned, and was no obstacle to the Phocians being <note type="footnote"> 1 See page 102, note 2. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="142"/>
            saved, as is said-by whom ?-by Æschines the defendant <lb/>
            himself. For he did not then report, that but for the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians, or but for their not receiving Proxenus, or but for <lb/>
            Hegesippus, or but for this thing and the other, the Phocians <lb/>
            would have been saved-No: he passed over all that, and said <lb/>
            expressly that he had prevailed on Philip to save the Phocians, <lb/>
            to repeople Bœotia, to arrange things to your advantage;1 <lb/>
            that it would all be accomplished in two or three days, and <lb/>
            on that account the Thebans had set a price upon his head. <lb/>
            Therefore, if he talks about what the Lacedæmonians or what <lb/>
            the Phocians had done before he made these reports, don't <lb/>
            listen to him nor hear a word; and don't suffer him to make <lb/>
            charges of immorality against the Phocians. It was not for <lb/>
            their merit that you rescued the Lacedæmonians formerly, or <lb/>
            these accursed Eubœans, or many others, but because their <lb/>
            safety was for the interest of the commonwealth, as that of the <lb/>
            Phocians was lately. And what fault did the Phocians or the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians or yourselves or any other people commit <lb/>
            after this man's statements, to cause the miscarriage of what <lb/>
            he then told you ? Ask him this: he won't be able to explain. <lb/>
            There have been but five days in which he made his false <lb/>
            report, you believed him, the Phocians got the news, yielded <lb/>
            themselves up, and perished. From this, I imagine, it appears <lb/>
            clearly, that the whole fraud and artifice was contrived for the <lb/>
            purpose of destroying the Phocians. For in the interval after <lb/>
            the peace, while Philip was unable to march, but was making <lb/>
            preparations, he sent for the Lacedæmonians, and promised to <lb/>
            do everything for them, that the Phocians might not get <lb/>
            them for auxiliaries through you. But when he arrived at <lb/>
            Thermopylae, and the Lacedæmonians perceiving the snare <lb/>
            withdrew, he then put this man forward2 to deceive you; for he <note type="footnote"> 1 Pabst: Euch Einfluss auf die dortigen Angelegenkeiten zu ver­ <lb/>

            him, and not any of the Phocians. It is better you should <lb/>
            hear the explanation from me beforehand. Among the ex­ <lb/>
            patriated Phocians, the best and most respectable being in <lb/>
            exile and consequent distress keep themselves quiet, and <lb/>
            none of them would like to incur private hostility on account <lb/>
            of the public misfortunes; while those who would do any­ <lb/>
            thing for money can find no one to give it them. I certainly <lb/>
            would not have feed any of them, to stand up for me here and <lb/>
            cry out what they had suffered : for the truth and the facts <lb/>
            cry out of themselves. As to the Phocian commonalty, they <lb/>
            are in such a wretched and deplorable condition, that they <lb/>
            have no thought of being prosecutors at Athenian audits, but <lb/>
            are every one of them slaves, frightened to death at the <lb/>
            Thebans and the mercenaries of Philip, whom they are forced <lb/>
            to maintain, scattered themselves over villages, and deprived <lb/>
            of their arms. Don't allow him then to use that argument, <lb/>
            but make him show that the Phocians have not been ruined, <lb/>
            or that he never promised that Philip would save them. <lb/>
            These are the questions at the account of an embassy-What <lb/>
            has been negotiated? what was your report ? If true, take <lb/>
            your acquittal; if false, pay the penalty. What matters it <lb/>
            whether the Phocians are present or not ? They are in such a <lb/>
            plight, I fancy -and you did your best to bring them into <lb/>
            it-they can neither help their friends nor punish their <lb/>
            enemies.</p>
          <p>But besides the general discredit and disgrace which these <lb/>
            proceedings are attended with, it is easy to show that serious <lb/>
            perils consequently menace the state. For which of you is <lb/>
            ignorant that by the Phocian war, and the Phocians being <lb/>
            masters of Thermopylae, we were out of all apprehension from <lb/>
            the Thebans; never could they or Philip make their way to <lb/>
            Peloponnesus, nor to Eubœa, nor Attica This security, <lb/>
            which place and circumstances guaranteed to the common­ <lb/>
            wealth, you, trusting to the falsehoods and artifices of these <lb/>
            men, abandoned: fortified though it was by arms, by con­ <lb/>
             <pb n="145"/>
            turned war, by great cities of an allied people, and by an ex­ <lb/>
            tensive territory, you suffered it to be overthrown.1 And your <lb/>
            former expedition to Thermopylae has become fruitless, which <lb/>
            cost you more than two hundred talents, reckoning the pri­ <lb/>
            vate expenses of those who served. Your hopes about the <lb/>
            Thebans are fruitless also. But what, among many shameful <lb/>
            services which this man has performed for Philip, involves <lb/>
            really the most contemptuous treatment of the common­ <lb/>
            wealth, and all of you, I beg you to hear-it is this: that <lb/>
            Philip having determined from the beginning to do all that he <lb/>
            has done for the Thebans, Æschines, by reporting the con­ <lb/>
            trary, and making it manifest that you were against what he <lb/>
            did, has increased your enmity with the Thebans and their <lb/>
            friendliness to Philip. How could a man have treated you <lb/>
            more contumeliously ?</p>
          <p>Take and read the decree of Diophantus, and that of Callis­ <lb/>
            thenes, to show you that when you performed your duties, <lb/>
            you were recompensed with thanksgivings and praise both at <lb/>
            Athens and elsewhere, but after you had been deluded by <lb/>
            these men, you brought in your women and children from the <lb/>
            country, and decreed to perform the Heraclean sacrifice within <lb/>
            the city in time of peace : which makes me wonder whether <lb/>
            you will let off with impunity a man who caused even the <lb/>
            gods to be deprived of their customary worship. Read the <lb/>
            decree.</p>

            either originally concluded peace and alliance, or were after­ <lb/>
            wards persuaded to insert the clause, “ and to his posterity," <lb/>
            but under the belief that through these men you would get <lb/>
            marvellous benefits. You all know how often afterwards you <lb/>
            were alarmed by hearing. of Philip's army and mercenaries in <lb/>
            the neighbourhood of Porthmus or Megara.1 Therefore, though <lb/>
            he may not yet have invaded Attic ground, it is not that you <lb/>
            must look at, nor relax in your vigilance: you must see <lb/>
            whether he has through these men got the opportunity of <lb/>
            doing it when he pleases; this peril you must keep in view, <lb/>
            and abhor and punish the guilty person who has furnished <lb/>
            him with such opportunity.</p>
          <p>I know indeed that Æschines will avoid all discussion of the <lb/>
            charges against him; that, seeking to withdraw you as far as <lb/>
            possible from the facts, he will rehearse what mighty blessings <lb/>
            accrue to mankind from peace, and, on the other hand, what <lb/>
            evils from war; in short, he will pronounce a panegyric on <lb/>
            peace, and take up that line of defence. Yet even these are so <lb/>
            many arguments to convict him. For if the cause of bless­ <lb/>
            ings to others has been the cause of so many troubles and <lb/>
            such confusion to us, what else can one suppose, but that by <lb/>
            taking bribes these men have spoiled a thing in its own <lb/>
            nature excellent ?</p>
          <p>Oh, but—he may say perhaps—have you not preserved, <lb/>
            and won't you preserve through the peace three hundred <lb/>
            galleys, with stores for them and money ?-In regard to this <lb/>
            you must understand, that Philip's resources likewise have <lb/>
            been largely augmented through the peace, in supplies of <lb/>
            arms, in territory, in revenues, of which he has gained an <lb/>
            abundance. True, some have come in to us also. But that <lb/>
            establishment of power and alliances, through which people <lb/>
            hold their good things either for themselves or their supe­ <lb/>
            riors2—ours has been sold by these men, and gone to ruin <note type="footnote"> 1 See vol. i. pp. 119, 128. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Schaefer explains it: “ Potentioribus, ubi aut unus regnat, aut <lb/>
            oligarchis civitas subjecta est." Pabst renders it thus: durch welchen <lb/>
            einst A lie, theils für sich, theils für einen mächtigern Staat, Güter und <lb/>
            Vortheile gewonnen haben. And with this latter interpretation I agree. <lb/>
            Thus the whole Athenian empire is that establishment of power and <lb/>
            alliances, <foreign xml:lang="grc">καταϭκευὴ πραγμάτων καὶ ϭυμμάχων</foreign>, through which the Lem­ <lb/>
            nians, Imbrians, and other subject people, hold what they have, (their <lb/>
            country, their harbours, their revenues, &amp;c.) partly for themselves, </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="147"/>
            and decay;1 his hath become formidable and mightier by far. <lb/>
            It is not just, that Philip should through these men have <lb/>
            augmented both his alliances and his revenues, while what <lb/>
            Athens must naturally have gained by the peace they set off <lb/>
            against what was sold by themselves. The one has not come <lb/>
            to us in exchange for the other-very far from it: one we <lb/>
            should equally have had, and the other in addition, but for <lb/>
            these men.</p>
          <p>Speaking generally, men of Athens, I presume you will <lb/>
            agree, that on the one hand, however many and grievous <lb/>
            have been the misfortunes of the commonwealth, if Æschines <lb/>
            be not to blame for any, your resentment ought not to fall upon <lb/>
            him; and, on the other hand, if any advantages have been <lb/>
            achieved through others, they ought not to save him. Con­ <lb/>
            sider what the defendant has been the cause of; look favour­ <lb/>
            ably on him, if favour he deserves, but with anger, if he has <lb/>
            done aught to excite it. How will you ascertain the truth of <lb/>
            the matter ? In this way—you must not let him confound <lb/>
            all things together-the misdeeds of the generals, the war <lb/>
            with Philip, the blessings of peace-but you must consider <lb/>
            each point by itself. For example - Was Philip at war with <lb/>
            us? He was. Does any man complain of Æschines on that <lb/>
            account ? Would any man wish to arraign him for the <lb/>
            transactions of the war No man. Well then ; upon those <lb/>
            points he is acquitted, and has no need to say anything : for <lb/>
            it is a defendant's business to produce witnesses and proofs <lb/>
            upon the matters in issue, not to mystify the court by pleading <note type="footnote"> partly for the Athenians, who are at the head of the empire. The power <lb/>
            of the general confederacy supports every constituent part of it. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 On the expression, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπόλωλε καὶ γέγονεν ἀϭθενὴς</foreign>, Schaefer observes : <lb/>

            what no one disputes. Mind then, that you say nothing <lb/>
            about the war; for no one charges you with anything con­ <lb/>
            cerning it. Afterwards certain persons advised us to make <lb/>
            peace; we followed their advice; we sent ambassadors; they <lb/>
            brought people to Athens to conclude peace. Here again, <lb/>
            does any one blame Æschines for this ? No one. Does any <lb/>
            man say that he introduced the question of peace, or is guilty <lb/>
            of crime for having brought people here to conclude it ? No <lb/>
            man. No more should he say anything about the fact of our <lb/>
            concluding peace : for he is not chargeable with it.</p>
          <p>What then do you say, man?—suppose I were asked­ <lb/>
            from what point do you commence your accusation ? From <lb/>
            this, men of Athens-when, at the time you were deliberating, <lb/>
            not whether you should make peace or no, (for that had <lb/>
            already been resolved upon,) but what sort of a peace you <lb/>
            should have, he opposed the men who offered honest advice, <lb/>
            and supported the mover of a corrupt resolution, himself <lb/>
            being bribed; and afterwards, on being chosen to receive the <lb/>
            oaths, he entirely neglected your instructions, destroyed those <lb/>
            allies who had come safe through the whole war, and told <lb/>
            such huge falsehoods as no mortal ever did either before or <lb/>
            after. At first indeed, until Philip got leave to negotiate for <lb/>
            peace, Ctesiphon and Aristodemus commenced the beginning <lb/>
            of the plot; but when things were ripe for execution, they <lb/>
            handed it over to Philocrates and the defendant, who took up <lb/>
            the matter and ruined everything. Now that he must render <lb/>
            an account of what has been done, and stand his trial for it, <lb/>
            the defendant, I imagine, like a rascally and abominable <lb/>
            clerk 1 as he is, will plead his defence as if he were tried for <lb/>
            the peace-not that he may render an account of more than <lb/>
            he is accused of; that were madness-but he sees, that in his <lb/>
            own conduct there is nothing good and everything criminal, <lb/>
            while a defence of peace, if it have nothing else about it, has <lb/>
            in name at least a show of humanity. I fear indeed, 0 <note type="footnote"> 1 In Bekker's edition <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ</foreign> stands before <foreign xml:lang="grc">γραμματεὺς</foreign>, which appears to <lb/>
            be thrown in as an additional term of reproach. And so Retake under­ <lb/>
            stands it: “ erat convicium usurpatum pro nomine vilissimâ stirpe, <lb/>
            quaestus sordidi, versuto, impure, scelerato, audaci." Schaefer dissents <lb/>
            from this view, and expunges <foreign xml:lang="grc">καί</foreign>. Demosthenes does often refer to the <lb/>
            early occupation of Æschines, but rather contemptuously than by way <lb/>
            of strong reproach. Where he means the latter, he adds an epithet, as <lb/>

            Athenians, I fear, that without knowing it, like persons who <lb/>
            borrow money, we are enjoying the peace at a high rate : for <lb/>
            these men betrayed what constituted its strength and security, <lb/>
            the Phocians and Thermopylae. However, it was not through <lb/>
            the defendant we originally made it: for what I am about to <lb/>
            say is strange, yet perfectly true-if any one is really glad of <lb/>
            the peace, let him thank the generals for it, whom all accuse. <lb/>
            Had they carried on the war as you desired, the very name of <lb/>
            peace would have been intolerable to you. Peace therefore <lb/>
            is owing to them : perilous and unstable and insecure has it <lb/>
            become through these men having taken bribes. Bar him <lb/>
            then, bar him from any argument in favour of peace, and put <lb/>
            him to his defence for what he has done. For Æschines is <lb/>
            not tried for the peace; no: the peace is discredited through <lb/>
            Machines. Here is the proof-if the peace had been con­ <lb/>
            eluded without any deception being afterwards practised on <lb/>
            you, or any of your allies being ruined, what mortal would <lb/>
            the peace have aggrieved, independently of its being dis­ <lb/>
            honourable ? Of this indeed the defendant was in part the <lb/>
            cause, by supporting Philocrates: nothing fatal however <lb/>
            would have taken place. Now, I conceive, he is answerable <lb/>
            for a great deal.</p>
          <p>That these men have shamefully and basely wrought all <lb/>
            this ruin and mischief, I suppose you are all satisfied. I <lb/>
            however, men of the jury, am so far from entering upon these <lb/>
            questions in a vexatious spirit, or wishing you to do so, that <lb/>
            if it has all been brought about through thoughtlessness or <lb/>
            good nature or any kind of ignorance, I acquit Æschines <lb/>
            myself and I advise you also. Though indeed none of these <lb/>
            excuses is constitutional or just, for no one is required or <lb/>
            compelled by you to perform public business; but when a <lb/>
            man has persuaded himself of his ability and applies for it, <lb/>
            you, acting the part of worthy and benevolent people, receive <lb/>
            bim with favour and without envy; you elect him, and put <lb/>
            your affairs into his hands. Then if a man be successful, he <lb/>
            will be honoured and have an advantage over the bulk of the <lb/>
            people in this respect; if he fails, shall he set up excuses and <lb/>
            apologies ? That would not be fair. It would be no satis­ <lb/>
            faction to our ruined allies or to their wives or children or <lb/>
            any other parties, that my incapacity (not to say the <lb/>
            defendant's) had brought such misfortune upon them-far <lb/>
             <pb n="150"/>
            from it indeed. However, you may forgive Æschines these' <lb/>
            dreadful and monstrous things, if it appears that he has <lb/>
            damaged the cause through stupidity or any kind of <lb/>
            ignorance : but if he has done it from a base motive, having <lb/>
            received money and presents, and if he is clearly convicted by <lb/>
            the facts themselves, put him to death if it be possible, or if <lb/>
            that cannot be, make him a living example to others. Now <lb/>
            consider in your minds, how convincing the proof of his <lb/>
            guilt will be.</p>
          <p>I presume that Æschines the defendant must have addressed <lb/>
            those speeches to you, those about the Phocians and Thespiæ <lb/>
            and Eubœa, (supposing he was not from a corrupt motive <lb/>
            intentionally playing false,) from one of two causes; either <lb/>
            because he had heard Philip expressly promise to effect and <lb/>
            do the things in question, or else because he was charmed. <lb/>
            and beguiled by Philip's general liberality, and therefore <lb/>
            expected those things from him also. There is no other <lb/>
            alternative. Now in either of these cases he ought beyond <lb/>
            all other men to detest Philip. Why ? Because, so far as it <lb/>
            depended on Philip, he has suffered the utmost indignity and <lb/>
            disgrace. He has deceived you; he has become infamous; <lb/>
            he is judged to be a lost man, if he had his deserts.1 Had <lb/>
            due proceedings been taken, he would have been impeached <lb/>
            long ago; but now through your simplicity and good nature <lb/>
            he attends his audit, and chooses his time for it. Is there <lb/>
            one of you who has heard the voice of Æschines accusing <lb/>
            Philip ?-who has seen him pressing any charge or speaking <lb/>
            to the point ? No one. Every Athenian is more ready to <lb/>
            accuse Philip-any indeed that you like-though none of <lb/>
            them assuredly has sustained any personal injury. I should <lb/>
            have expected language like this from him, if he had not sold <lb/>
            himself-,, Men of Athens, deal with me as you please: I: <lb/>
            believed, I was deluded, I was in error, I confess it: but <lb/>
            beware of the man, 0 Athenians: he is not to be trusted, he is <lb/>
            a j uggler, a vilain. See you not how he has treated me ? how he <lb/>
            has cajoled me ?” I hear no language of this kind, nor do you* <lb/>
            Why? Because he was not cajoled or deceived, but had <lb/>
            hired himself and taken money when he made those state- <lb/>
            mental and betrayed you to Philip, and has been a good, true <note type="footnote"> 1 According to Bekker's reading, <foreign xml:lang="grc">δικαίως</foreign>. But I rather incline to </note> <figure type="illustration">

              and faithful hireling to him, but a traitorous ambassador and <lb/>
              citizen to you, deserving to perish not once but three times <lb/>
              over.</p>
          <p>Nor is this the only proof that he was bribed to make all <lb/>
            those statements. There came to you lately some envoys <lb/>
            from Thessaly, and some of Philip's with them, requiring you <lb/>
            to acknowledge Philip as an Amphictyon. Now of all men <lb/>
            who was most especially bound to oppose them ? Æschines <lb/>
            here. Why? Because his reports to you were contradicted <lb/>
            by Philip's acts. This man said that he would fortify Thespiæ <lb/>
            and Platæa, and not destroy the Phocians, but humble the <lb/>
            insolence of the Thebans : whereas Philip has made the <lb/>
            Thebans greater than they should be, the Phocians he has <lb/>
            utterly destroyed; and instead of fortifying Thespiæ and <lb/>
            Platæa, he has reduced Orchomenus and Coronea also to <lb/>
            slavery. How could any things be more contrary to . one <lb/>
            another? Yet he opposed them not; he never opened his <lb/>
            mouth or uttered a word against them. And this, bad as it <lb/>
            is, is not the worst :—he spoke on their side, he and no other <lb/>
            person in the state. Even the profligate Philocrates ventured <lb/>
            not to do this ; Æschines, the man before you, did: and when <lb/>
            you clamoured and refused to hear him, he came down from <lb/>
            the platform, and said, showing himself off to Philip's ambas­ <lb/>
            sadors who were present-" There were many to clamour, but <lb/>
            few to fight when it was needful:" this you surely remember <lb/>
            — he himself doubtless being a wonderful soldier, 0 Jupiter!</p>
          <p>Yet more-if we were unable to show that any of the <lb/>
            ambassadors had got anything, and it was not plain enough <lb/>
            for all men to see, we must have resorted to question by <lb/>
            torture and the like. But if Philocrates not only confessed <lb/>
            his gains frequently in your assembly, but even displayed <lb/>
            them before you, selling wheat, building houses, declaring <note type="footnote"> 1 This refers to the practice, common not only in criminal but also <lb/>
            in civil proceedings at Athens, of examining slaves by torture. The <lb/>
            parties to a cause were at liberty either to give up their own slaves to <lb/>
            be examined in this way, or to demand those of the adversary; and <lb/>
            though it was not compulsory to give up a slave, the refusal might be <lb/>
            attributed to fear of the truth coming out. No slave was admissible <lb/>
            as a witness, except on this condition; such was the degraded state to <lb/>
            which men were reduced by servitude in Greece. On the other hand, <lb/>
            it was not lawful to apply the torture to freemen, except under extra­ <lb/>
            ordinary circumstances, when the necessities of the commonwealth <lb/>
            required it. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="152"/>
            that he would make his journey,1 whether you elected him or <lb/>
            not, importing timber, changing gold openly at the banks; <lb/>
            he surely cannot deny that he has had money, he that him­ <lb/>
            self makes a confession and display of it. Then is there any <lb/>
            man so senseless or infatuate, that, to procure money for <lb/>
            Philocrates, and bring discredit and danger upon himself, <lb/>
            when he might appear in the ranks of the innocent, he would <lb/>
            rather be at enmity with them, and side with Philocrates to <lb/>
            be prosecuted ? There is no such man, I believe. All these, <lb/>
            if you examine them rightly, 0 Athenians, you will find to be <lb/>
            clear and ample proofs that Æschines has taken bribes.</p>
          <p>A thing which has last occurred, but is as good a proof as <lb/>
            any that he has sold himself to Philip, I beg you to consider. <lb/>
            You know of course, that when Hyperides lately impeached <lb/>
            Philocrates, 1 came forward and said, I was dissatisfied with <lb/>
            one point in the impeachment, if it alleged that Philocrates <lb/>
            had alone been guilty of so many grave misdemeanors, and <lb/>
            the other nine ambassadors were entirely innocent. And I <lb/>
            declared it was not so; for he by himself would have been of <lb/>
            no account, if he had not had some of these men to cooperate <lb/>
            with him. “However," said I, “that I may neither acquit <lb/>
            nor accuse any man, but that facts themselves may discover <lb/>
            the guilty, and clear those who are not implicated, let any <lb/>
            man that pleases get up and declare before you, that he has <lb/>
            no concern in the acts of Philocrates, and approves them not. <lb/>
            And whoever does so, I will acquit him," I said. This you­ <lb/>
            remember, I suppose. Well: no one came forward or showed <lb/>
            himself And the rest have each an excuse: one was not <lb/>
            accountable; one perhaps was not present; another had a <lb/>
            son-in-law yonder.2 The defendant however has no such <note type="footnote"> 1 I. e. to Macedonia. When Philocrates said this does not appear. <lb/>
            In the construction I follow Auger and Pabst. But Francis connects <lb/>

            interpretation. Others read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκεῖνος</foreign>, meaning Philocrates. Schaefer <lb/>
            thinks that the supposed reflection upon Phrynon would be beneath <lb/>
            the dignity of an orator. The charge itself is distinctly made at page <lb/>

            reason. So completely hath he sold himself, and not only <lb/>
            received wages for past services, but makes it plain that here­ <lb/>
            after, should he now get off, he will help Philip against you, <lb/>
            that, to avoid letting fall even a word in opposition to Philip, <lb/>
            he accepts not even acquittal when we offer it, but chooses to <lb/>
            incur infamy, prosecution, any kind of indignity at Athens, <lb/>
            rather than do anything to give Philip displeasure.</p>
          <p>But what is this connexion, this over-anxiety for Philo­ <lb/>
            crates? Had he done ever such great things, and got every <lb/>
            advantage by his diplomacy, yet, if he confessed having made <lb/>
            money by it, as he does confess, this is the very thing1 from <lb/>
            which an incorrupt ambassador should have kept himself <lb/>
            aloof and clear, and protested against it for his own part. <lb/>
            Æschines however has not done so. Are not these facts <lb/>
            plain, men of Athens ? Don't they cry aloud, that Æschines <lb/>
            has taken bribes and is a scoundrel systematically for lucre's <lb/>
            sake, not in thoughtlessness, nor in ignorance, nor by reason <lb/>
            of failures?</p>
          <p>And what witness proves that I have taken bribes ?—says <lb/>
            he. This is his grand point.—The facts, Æschines, which are <lb/>
            the surest of all things; and it is impossible to charge or <lb/>
            allege, that they are what they are in obedience or out of <lb/>
            favour to any person. No: just what your treason and <lb/>
            mischief has made them, they on examination appear to be. <lb/>
            But in addition to the facts, you shall bear testimony against <lb/>
            yourself immediately. Come, stand up and answer me.2 <lb/>
            You can't urge that from inexperience you have nothing to <lb/>
            say. You that conduct new prosecutions, like new dramas, <lb/>
            and win them without witnesses even, in the division of <lb/>
            a day, you must surely be a prodigy of an orator.3 <note type="footnote"> 1 That is, the money-making, as I understand it. But Schaefer refers <lb/>
            it to the connexion with Philocrates, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν κοινωνίαν καὶ τὴν πολλὴν πρό­ <lb/>

          <p>Many dreadful things hath Æschines the defendant perpe­ <lb/>
            trated, involving a high degree of baseness, as I think you <lb/>
            will agree; yet there is nothing in my judgment so dreadful <lb/>
            as what I am about to mention ; nothing that will so pal­ <lb/>
            pably convict him of having taken bribes and sold every­ <lb/>
            thing.</p>
          <p>When you were for the third time again despatching envoys <lb/>
            to Philip, under those great and splendid expectations which <lb/>
            the defendant had held out, you elected him and me and most <lb/>
            of the others the same as before. I came forward directly and <lb/>
            excused myself,1 and when certain persons clamoured and <lb/>
            called on me to go, I declared I would not leave Athens: the <lb/>
            defendant had then been elected. After the assembly had <lb/>
            broken up, these men met and consulted whom they should <note type="footnote">prosecutor in a court of justice; but it refers rather to the novelty of <lb/>
            the proceeding itself, as Francis understands it. The credit due to <lb/>
            AEschines was enhanced by the circumstance that he had a very limited <lb/>
            time allowed him to plead in. This may have been for the reason <lb/>
            assigned by Reiske, that the causes for that day were so numerous, they <lb/>
            were obliged to circumscribe the time for each. Or perhaps the time <lb/>
            allowed for that species of trial (viz. a <foreign xml:lang="grc">δοκιμασία</foreign>) was shorter than for <lb/>
            ordinary causes. Harpocration explains <foreign xml:lang="grc">διαμεμετρημένη ἡμέρα</foreign> by stating, <lb/>
            that the whole time for a cause was divided by the Clepsydra into three <lb/>
            portions,-one for each of the parties, and one for the jury. Whether <lb/>
            such explanation suits this passage may be doubtful. Demosthenes <lb/>
            seems rather to speak of something out of the common course, or there <lb/>
            would be no point in the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρὸς δ</foreign>. r. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ</foreign>. I understand <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρὸς</foreign> in the <lb/>
            sense of “against," the limitation of time being an adverse circum­ <lb/>
            stance against which the orator had to contend : so we say, “ to speak <lb/>
            against time." Francis takes these words in quite a different sense. <lb/>
            His verson is: ., which were of such importance as to demand a <lb/>
            particular day for their determination." Pabst: in abgemessenen <lb/>
            Tagestunden. </note><note type="footnote"> Auger translates the whole passage as follows: “Puisque dans un <lb/>
            temps limits vous plaidez des causes toutes neuves avec l'art d'un <lb/>
            poete qui compose un drame, et que vous lea gagnez sans le secours <lb/>

            note 2. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Literally: "excused myself on oath-swore off." As Francis has <lb/>
            it: " declared upon oath I could not accept the employment.”A man <lb/>
            desirous of excusing himself from such an appointment as the one in <lb/>
            question was obliged to assign some reason for it, as illness or the like, <lb/>
            and to put in an affidavit stating such reason. The affidavit was called <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξωμοσία</foreign>, and was recorded. It would appear from this passage, that <lb/>
            almost any formal excuse was admitted. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="155"/>
            leave behind: for, while things were yet in suspense and the <lb/>
            future was uncertain, conferences and discussions of all kinds <lb/>
            took place in the market; they feared therefore that an extra­ <lb/>
            ordinary assembly1 might be convened on a sudden, that you <lb/>
            might hear the truth from me, and pass some proper resolu­ <lb/>
            tions in favour of the Phocians, and so things would Blip out <lb/>
            of Philip's hands. Indeed, had you but voted and shown them <lb/>
            a glimpse of hope, they would have been saved. For impos­ <lb/>
            sible, impossible was it for Philip to remain, if you had not <lb/>
            been tricked; as there was neither any grain in the country, <lb/>
            it not having been sown on account of the war, nor could <lb/>
            any grain be brought while your galleys were there and com­ <lb/>
            manded the sea; and the Phocian cities were numerous and <lb/>
            hard to take, except by a long siege; for if he took a city in <lb/>
            a day, they are twenty-two in number. For all these reasons, <lb/>
            that you might not change the course into which you had <lb/>
            been entrapped, they left AEschines at home. Well, but to <lb/>
            excuse himself without some ground was dangerous, and <lb/>
            fraught with suspicion.—“ What say you ? aren't you going, <lb/>
            after these mighty advantages of your own announcing, and <lb/>
            won't you be on the embassy ?”—Still it was necessary to <lb/>
            stay. How to act then ?—He pretends to be ill, and his <lb/>
            brother, taking Execestus the physician and going to the <lb/>
            council, made affidavit of the defendant's illness, and was <lb/>
            himself appointed. Five or six days after, when the Phocians <lb/>
            had been destroyed, and this man's hire had come to an end <lb/>
            like anything else, and Dercylus had returned from Chalets, <lb/>
            and reported to you, in assembly at Piræus, that the Phocians <lb/>
            were destroyed, and you, men of Athens, naturally on re­ <lb/>
            ceiving that intelligence were smitten with compassion for <lb/>
            them and terror on your own account, and passed a vote tc <lb/>
            bring in your women and children from the country, and to <lb/>
            repair the garrisons and fortify Piræus, and offer the Heraclean <lb/>
            sacrifice within the city,-in this state of things, when the <lb/>
            commonwealth was in the midst of such confusion and alarm, <lb/>
            this clever and powerful and loud-voiced orator, without any <lb/>
            appointment by the council or the people, went off as ambas­ <lb/>
            sador to the author of all the mischief, taking into account <lb/>
            neither the illness on which he grounded his excuse, nor the <lb/>
            fact that another ambassador had been chosen in his stead, <note type="footnote"> 1 See Appendix V. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="156"/>
            nor that the law provides the penalty of death for such con­ <lb/>
            duct, nor how monstrous it was, after reporting that a price <lb/>
            had been set upon his head in Thebes, when the Thebans had <lb/>
            in addition to the lordship of all Boeotia become masters also <lb/>
            of the Phocian territory, to take a journey then to the heart <lb/>
            of Thebes and the Theban camp : so insane was he, so intent <lb/>
            upon his pelf and reward, that in defiance and despite of all <lb/>
            these considerations he took himself off.</p>
          <p>Such is the character of this proceeding: but what he did <lb/>
            on his arrival there is far more shocking. For when all of <lb/>
            you here, and the Athenians in general, considered the poor <lb/>
            Phocians so shamefully and cruelly treated, that you would <lb/>
            not send either members1 of the council or the judges to <lb/>
            represent you at the Pythian games, but abstained from your <lb/>
            customary deputation to the festival, Æschines went to the <lb/>
            sacrifice which Philip and the Thebans offered in honour of <lb/>
            their success and conquest, and was feasted, and joined in the <lb/>
            libations and prayers which Philip offered up in thanksgiving <lb/>
            for the lost fortresses and territory and troops of your allies, <lb/>
            and donned the garland and sang the paean in company with <lb/>
            Philip, and pledged to him the cup of friendship.</p>
          <p>Nor is it possible that I should state the matter thus, and <lb/>
            the defendant otherwise. With respect to the affidavit, there <lb/>
            is an entry in your public register in the temple of Cybele, <lb/>
            which is given in charge to the superintendent, and a decree <lb/>
            has been specially drawn concerning that name.2 With respect <note type="footnote"> 1 The Athenians, as well as all the other people who belonged to the <lb/>
            Hellenic community, sent deputies regularly to the great periodical <lb/>
            festivals—the Olympian, Pythian, Isthmian, and Nemean. These depu­ <lb/>
            ties represented the state, and it would appear that certain members of <lb/>
            the council, and of the six junior archons, (whom I call in my transla­ <lb/>
            tion the judges,) or at least persons chosen from one or the other of <lb/>
            these bodies, formed part of the deputation. They were called <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεωροὶ</foreign>, <lb/>
            which name signifies simply " spectators," derived from <foreign xml:lang="grc">θέα</foreign>, a spectacle, <lb/>
            unless we adopt the explanation of Pollux, who derives it from <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεὸς</foreign> <lb/>
            and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὤρα</foreign>, as if it properly designated parties concerned in some divine <lb/>
            service or ceremony. The common uses of the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεωρεῖν</foreign> and its <lb/>
            derivatives perhaps favour the former derivation, though it is true that <lb/>
            the spectacles to which these deputies were sent to attend partook always <lb/>
            of a religious character; and persons despatched on more purely reli­ <lb/>
            gious missions-as to consult an oracle, or the like-received the same <lb/>
            appellation. For further information, see the Archaeological Dictionary, <lb/>

          <p>What prayer do you suppose Philip offered to the gods <lb/>
            when he poured his libation? What do you suppose the <lb/>
            Thebans ? Did they not pray for might and victory in battle <lb/>
            for them and their allies; the contrary for the allies of the <lb/>
            Phocians ? Well then; AEschines joined in that prayer, and <lb/>
            invoked a curse upon his country, which you ought now to <lb/>
            make recoil upon his head.</p>
          <p>He departed therefore in violation of the law, which makes <lb/>
            such an act punishable with death: on his arrival, it has been <lb/>
            shown, he did what he deserves to die for a second time: and <lb/>
            his former acts and measures in this behalf1 as ambassador <lb/>
            will justify his execution. Consider then what penalty there <lb/>
            can be of severity enough to be deemed adequate to all his <lb/>
            crimes. For would it not be shameful, 0 Athenians, that <lb/>
            you and the whole people should publicly condemn all the <lb/>
            proceedings consequent upon the peace, and refuse to take <lb/>
            any part in Amphictyonic business, and regard Philip with <lb/>
            displeasure and distrust, because the proceedings are impious <lb/>
            and shocking, opposed at the same time to your interests and <lb/>
            to justice; yet, when you have come into court to adjudicate <lb/>
            at the audit of these matters, a sworn jury on behalf of the <lb/>
            commonwealth, you should acquit the author of all the <lb/>
            mischief, whom you have caught in the very act when his <lb/>
            guilt was complete ? And which of your fellow-citizens, or <note type="footnote"> of AEschines to be expunged from the list of ambassadors, and that of <lb/>
            his brother to be substituted. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϓπὲρ τούτων</foreign>. " Dubium est, ad quos referatur, Philippumne et <lb/>

            rather of the Greeks at large, will not have reason to com <lb/>
            plain of you, seeing that you are wroth with Philip, who, in <lb/>
            the transition from war to a treaty of peace, purchased his <lb/>
            advantages from those that would sell them, a thing very <lb/>
            venial in him; yet you acquit this man, who so disgracefully <lb/>
            sold your interests, although the laws prescribe the heaviest <lb/>
            penalties for such conduct.</p>
          <p>Perhaps however an argument of the following kind may <lb/>
            be advanced by these men—that it will cause enmity with <lb/>
            Philip, if you convict the ambassadors who negotiated peace. <lb/>
            If this be true, I can't imagine anything stronger to be urged <lb/>
            against the defendant. For if the man who expended money <lb/>
            to obtain the peace has now become so formidable and <lb/>
            mighty, that you must disregard your oaths and obligations, <lb/>
            and consider only what you can do to gratify Philip, in what <lb/>
            way can the authors of such a result be sufficiently punished? <lb/>
            Though I think indeed I can show, that it will more probably <lb/>
            lead to a friendship advantageous for you. For it should be <lb/>
            understood, men of Athens, that Philip does not despise your <lb/>
            commonwealth, and did not prefer the Thebans to you, be­ <lb/>
            cause he thought you less capable of serving him; but he <lb/>
            was instructed by these men and informed-as I told you <lb/>
            once before in the assembly, and none of them contradicted <lb/>
            me—“ that the people 1 is of all things the most unstable and <note type="footnote"> 1 The word “ people," notwithstanding a little ambiguity, is preferable <lb/>
            to “ populace," or " mob," because it increases the odium sought to be <lb/>

            people of Athens by the very name that constitutionally belonged to <lb/>
            them. The comparison in the text reminds one of the famous simile in <lb/>
            Virgil, Æneid I. 148. The fickleness of the vulgus infidum has been a <lb/>
            theme for innumerable orators and poets. Even Jack Cade exclaims, after <lb/>
            he has been deserted by his followers, “ Was ever feather so lightly <lb/>

            who will transact and manage everything for him with you, for instance, <lb/>
            myself (the speaker).”—So Dobree nearly: " Your Majesty,” say these <lb/>

            a one as himself). </note><note type="footnote"> The same was my own impression originally, and it was with some </note> <lb/>

            inconstant, like a restless wind in the sea, put in motion by <lb/>
            any accident-one comes and another goes ; no one cares for <lb/>
            the public interests, or keeps them in mind-he should have <lb/>
            friends to transact everything for him with you, and manage <lb/>
            just as he would himself: if that were contrived for him, he <lb/>
            would accomplish all that he desired with you easily.”—If he <lb/>
            had heard, I fancy, that the persons who used such language <lb/>
            to him then had immediately after their return home been <lb/>
            cudgelled to death, he would have done the same as the <lb/>
            Persian king. What did the Persian king? He had been <lb/>
            deceived by Timagoras, and given him forty talents, as report <lb/>
            says; but when he heard that Timagoras1 had been put to <lb/>
            death at Athens, and had not the means even to ensure his <lb/>
            own safety, much less to perform his late promise to him, he <lb/>
            saw that he had not given his fee to the party with whom the <lb/>
            power rested. So, in the first place, he made Amphipolis <lb/>
            again your subject, which before he had registered as his own <lb/>
            ally and friend ;2 and, in the next place, he never afterwards <lb/>
            gave money to any man. And Philip would have done the <note type="footnote"> hesitation that I took a different view. There is an awkwardness in the <lb/>
            change from the plural <foreign xml:lang="grc">τούτων</foreign> to the singular <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτός</foreign>. Again, it would <lb/>
            be clumsy to make <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτὸς</foreign> refer to the speaker, when there is an <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτῷ</foreign> so <lb/>
            close both before and after it referring to Philip. And there would be <lb/>
            a little difficulty in the construction. It is true, there is some harshness <lb/>
            in the other method. I should prefer reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἷ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄν</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> I As to this story, see p. 130, note 2. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 I adhere to Bekker's reading, and understand it thus: “Artaxerxes, <lb/>
            seeing the fate of Timagoras, sought to conciliate the people of Athens <lb/>
            by acknowledging their right to the possession of Amphipolis, which <lb/>
            before he had treated as independent, and registered in the archives of <lb/>
            the kingdom as his own ally. When he made such acknowledgment <lb/>
            does not appear. After the embassy of Pelopidas to Susa, the Persian <lb/>
            king sent a letter to Greece, containing the terms on which he desired <lb/>
            a general peace to be established. This was publicly read at Thebes, at <lb/>
            which city the Greek states had been invited to hold a congress, the <lb/>
            Thebans hoping to be placed in the same situation as the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            had been at the peace of Antalcidas. The king's wishes were entirely <lb/>
            in favour of Thebes, and there was a clause in the letter which virtually <lb/>
            required the disarming of the Athenian naval power. The Athenians <lb/>
            however and the Greeks in general refused to abide by the terms which <lb/>
            Artaxerxes sought to impose; and it may be that he, on receiving in­ <lb/>
            telligence of this, as well as of the execution of Timagoras, and the <lb/>
            probability of some new combination among the Greek states, which <lb/>
            might increase the influence of Athens, adopted a different tone, and <lb/>
            expressed his willingness to consent to a different settlement of affairs, <lb/>
            acknowledging (among other things) her title to Amphipolis. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="160"/>
            same, if he had seen any of these men punished; and now, if <lb/>
            he sees it, he will do so. But when he hears that they enjoy <lb/>
            reputation among you as speakers, as prosecutors of other <lb/>
            men, what should he do ? Seek to incur large expenses, when <lb/>
            he may incur less, and volunteer to court all, instead of two <lb/>
            or three ? Why, he would be mad.</p>
          <p>Even the Thebans Philip had no desire to serve as a people <lb/>
            -far from it; but he was persuaded by the ambassadors, and <lb/>
            I will tell you in what manner. Ambassadors came to him <lb/>
            from Thebes, at the same time that we were there from you. <lb/>
            He offered them money, and (according to their statement) a <lb/>
            great deal. The Theban envoys would not accept or receive <lb/>
            it. Afterwards at a certain sacrifice and banquet, when Philip <lb/>
            was drinking and making himself agreeable to them, he <lb/>
            offered them over the cup divers things, such as captives and <lb/>
            the like, and lastly some gold and silver goblets. All these <lb/>
            things they rejected, and would in no way compromise them­ <lb/>
            selves. At length Philon, one of the ambassadors, made a <lb/>
            speech worthy, 0 Athenians, to have been spoken not on <lb/>
            behalf of the Thebans, but on yours. He said he was do­ <lb/>
            lighted and rejoiced to see Philip liberally and generously <lb/>
            disposed to them : they, for their part, were his friends <lb/>
            already without those gifts; but they desired him to apply <lb/>
            his generosity to the affairs of the commonwealth, in which <lb/>
            he was then engaged,1 and to do something worthy both of <lb/>
            himself and the Thebans; and they promised then that the <lb/>
            whole commonwealth as well as themselves would be attached <lb/>
            to him. Now only see what has come of this, what events <lb/>
            have happened, to the Thebans; and consider in good sooth, <lb/>
            what an important thing it is not to sell the interests of the <lb/>
            state. First, they have obtained peace when they were dis­ <lb/>
            tressed and harassed by the war and getting the worst of it; <lb/>
            secondly, their enemies the Phocians have been utterly de­ <lb/>
            stroyed, and all their fortifications and cities demolished. Is <lb/>
            that all? No indeed ! Besides that they have Orchomenus, <lb/>
            Coronea, Corsiæ, Tilphossæum, as much of the Phocian terri­ <lb/>
            tory as they please. Such advantages have the Thebans <lb/>
            gained by the peace: greater they could not wish for, I <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν οἷς ἦν τότε</foreign>. SO Francis: " which were then before him." It in <lb/>
            possible however, that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ πόλις</foreign> may be the nominative to <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἦν</foreign>, and thus <lb/>
            Auger has taken it. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="161"/>
            imagine: but what have the Theban ambassadors gained? The <lb/>
            advantage of having done so much for their country-that is <lb/>
            all; but that is honourable and glorious, 0 Athenians, in <lb/>
            regard to praise and renown, which these men bartered away <lb/>
            for gold.</p>
          <p>Now let me contrast what the Athenian commonwealth <lb/>
            has gained by the peace, and what the Athenian ambassadors; <lb/>
            and see if the commonwealth and these men themselves have <lb/>
            fared alike. To the commonwealth the result has been, that <lb/>
            she has relinquished all her possessions and all her allies, and <lb/>
            has sworn to Philip, that, should any one else interfere ever <lb/>
            to preserve them, you will prevent it, and will regard the <lb/>
            person who wishes to restore them to you as an adversary <lb/>
            and a foe, the person who has deprived you of them as an <lb/>
            ally and a friend. These are the terms which Æschines the <lb/>
            defendant supported, and his coadjutor Philocrates proposed; <lb/>
            and when I prevailed on the first day and had persuaded you <lb/>
            to confirm the resolution1 of your allies, and to summon <lb/>
            Philip's ambassadors, the defendant drove it off to the follow­ <lb/>
            ing day, and persuaded you to adopt the decree of Philocrates, <lb/>
            in which these clauses, and many others yet more shameful, <lb/>
            are contained. To the state then such consequences have <lb/>
            resulted from the peace :-consequences more disgraceful <lb/>
            could not easily be found : but what to the ambassadors who <lb/>
            caused them? I pass by all the other matters which you <lb/>
            have seen-houses-timber-grain; but in the territory of <lb/>
            our ruined allies they have estates and farms of large extent, <lb/>
            bringing in to Philocrates an income of a talent, to Æschines <lb/>
            here thirty minas. Is it not shocking and dreadful, 0 <lb/>
            Athenians, that the misfortunes of your allies have become a <lb/>
            source of revenue to your ambassadors; that the same peace <lb/>
            has to the country which sent them proved to be destruction <lb/>
            of allies, cession of dominions, disgrace instead of honour, <lb/>
            while to the ambassadors, who wrought these mischiefs to the <note type="footnote"> 1 Schaefer interprets this, " decretum de sociis," taking it, I suppose, <lb/>
            to mean the decree of the Athenians that all the allies should be in­ <lb/>

            been a resolution passed by the deputies of the allies themselves, then <lb/>
            assembled at Athens, which Demosthenes says he supported. See page <lb/>

          <p>I shall not be surprised however, if he ventures to say <lb/>
            something of this kind-that it was not possible to conclude <lb/>
            the peace honourably or in the manner I desired, as the <lb/>
            generals had conducted the war badly. Should he say this, <lb/>
            pray remember to ask him, whether he went ambassador <lb/>
            from any other state, or from this only. If he went from <lb/>
            another, which he can say had been victorious in war and <lb/>
            possessed generals of ability, he has taken money with good <lb/>
            reason: :1but if he went from this, why on a treaty, where <lb/>
            the state which sent him renounced her own rights, did he <lb/>
            receive presents into the bargain ? The state which sent the <lb/>
            embassy should have got the same advantages as her ambas­ <lb/>
            sadors, if any justice were done.</p>
          <p>And again, consider this, men of Athens,- Which, think <lb/>
            ye, more prevailed in the war, the Phocians over the Thebans, <lb/>
            or Philip over you ? I am quite clear, the Phocians over the <lb/>
            Thebans. They held Orchomenus and Coronea and Tilphos­ <lb/>
            sæum, and had out off the Theban force at Neones,2 and had <lb/>
            slain two hundred and seventy at Hedyleum, and a trophy <lb/>
            was erected, and their cavalry were masters of the field, and <lb/>
            an Iliad of misfortunes beset the Thebans. You had suffered <lb/>
            nothing of the kind, and I trust you never may: the worst <note type="footnote"> 1 The argument is somewhat lame. The point of it is, that there is <lb/>
            more excuse when a minister of the victorious party is bribed to make <lb/>
            concessions to the enemy, than when a minister of the vanquished party <lb/>
            does the same thing. The former only diminishes his country's gain, <lb/>
            the other augments his country'is loss. The moral delinquency is the <lb/>

            thing in the war with Philip was, that you could not do him <lb/>
            harm when you desired; but you were perfectly secure against <lb/>
            being damaged yourselves. How comes it then, that by the <lb/>
            same peace the Thebans, who were so much beaten in the <lb/>
            war, have recovered their own possessions and won those of <lb/>
            their enemies, while you, the Athenians, have lost in time of <lb/>
            peace even what was preserved in war ? It is because their <lb/>
            interests were not sold by their ambassadors, while these men <lb/>
            have bartered yours away. That such has been the character <lb/>
            of these transactions, you will learn yet more clearly from <lb/>
            what follows.1</p>
          <p>When this treaty of Philocrates, which the defendant spoke <lb/>
            in favour of, was concluded, and Philip's ambassadors had <lb/>
            received the oaths and departed, (and up to this point no <lb/>
            incurable mischief had been done, but, though the peace was <lb/>
            dishonourable and unworthy of the state, yet we were to have <lb/>
            those wonderful advantages by way of compensation,) I asked <lb/>
            your leave,2 and urged these men to sail with the utmost <lb/>
            speed for the Hellespont, and not to sacrifice or let Philip get <lb/>
            possession of any of the places there in the interval. For I <lb/>
            knew well, that whatever is sacrificed in the transition from <lb/>
            war to peace is lost to the neglectful parties: for when once <lb/>
            people have made up their minds on the whole for peace, <lb/>
            they won't renew the war for what has been abandoned, but <lb/>
            that remains the property of the captors. Besides, I believed <lb/>
            the state would be sure to get one of two advantages, if we <lb/>
            sailed;—for either, we being on the spot and having sworn <lb/>
            him according to the decree, he would restore the places <lb/>
            which he had taken from the republic, and forbear to attack <note type="footnote"> 1 The preceding clause, which Beaker has included in brackets, <lb/>
            and which does not appear to fit the passage, I have omitted, as Francis <lb/>
            has. Auger's translation shows how little it suits the context, though <lb/>
            he tries to make it more intelligible by expansion: “Centre la verity <lb/>
            des faits qui precedent, Eschine aura le front de dire que vos allies <lb/>
            etoient fatigues et harassés par le guerre. Au reste, vous verrez encore <lb/>
            mieux, par ce qui suit, que vos deputes, gagnés par l'or de Philippe, ont <lb/>
            prévariqué dans leur ambassade." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 So Schaefer rightly explains <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἠξίουν ὑμᾶς</foreign>: and Auger: “ Je de <lb/>
            mandois au peuple." But it must not be understood of a request to the <lb/>
            assembly, but rather of an application to the proper authorities, as the <lb/>
            generals, or the council, to expedite the preparations for sail, provide <lb/>
            the travelling expenses, &amp;c. </note> <note type="footnote"> M2 </note> <lb/>

            the rest, or, if he did not, we should immediately report it to <lb/>
            Athens; and so you, seeing his rapacity and perfidy in those <lb/>
            distant and less important matters, would not be careless <lb/>
            about these more important and nearer home—I mean the <lb/>
            Phocians and Thermopylae: on the other hand, if he had not <lb/>
            captured those places and you had not been tricked, all your <lb/>
            interests would be secure, and your just demands cheerfully <lb/>
            accorded by him. And I had reason for supposing it would <lb/>
            be so. For if the Phocians were safe, as they were then, and <lb/>
            masters of Thermopylae, Philip could have held out no threat <lb/>
            to prevent your insisting upon any of your rights: neither a <lb/>
            land march nor a victory by sea would have opened him the <lb/>
            road to Attica, whilst you, if he refused to give you satis­ <lb/>
            faction, would instantly close his ports, and again reduce him <lb/>
            to distress for money and to a state of general blockade; so <lb/>
            that he would be the party dependent on the benefits of peace, <lb/>
            not you. That I am not now inventing and assuming the <lb/>
            merit of these things after the event, but that they were per­ <lb/>
            ceived by me at the time, and foreseen on your behalf and <lb/>
            communicated to these men, I will now give you the proof <lb/>
            As all the assemblies had been exhausted,1 and therefore no <lb/>
            new one could be had, and these men were not gone, but <lb/>
            lingering here, I as councillor frame a decree, (the people <lb/>
            having given full power to the council,) ordering the ambas­ <lb/>
            sadors to depart without delay, and the general Proxenus to <lb/>
            convey them to whatever place they should hear Philip was <lb/>
            in; and I drew it up just as I am telling you, in those <lb/>
            express words. Here-read me the decree.</p>

            be called. As to the Athenian law, see Appendix V. Reiske in his Index <lb/>
            explains these words as follows: "propterea quod, concionibus antea nimis <lb/>
            multis incassum habitis, salutare nihil neque decretum neque effectum <lb/>

            "propterea quod omne tempus concionibus habendis destinatum abierat.” <lb/>

          <p>I carried them from Athens downright against their will, <lb/>
            as you will see clearly by what they did afterwards. When <lb/>
            we arrived at Oreus and joined Proxenus, these men, instead <lb/>
            of sailing and performing your instructions, took a circuitous <lb/>
            journey, and before we came to Macedonia we wasted three- <lb/>
            and-twenty days; all the rest of the time before Philip came we <lb/>
            sat down in Pella, making fifty days altogether with those of <lb/>
            the journey. In that interval Doriscus, Thrace, the Fortresses,1 <lb/>
            the Sacred Mountain-everything, in short, during a time of <lb/>
            peace and truce was taken and disposed of by Philip; though <lb/>
            I was constantly speaking and remonstrating, at first giving <lb/>
            my opinion as in consultation, afterwards by way of instruc­ <lb/>
            tion to ignorant men, lastly as if I were addressing venal and <lb/>
            impious wretches without any reserve. The man who openly <lb/>
            opposed what I said, who thwarted all my counsels and your <lb/>
            decrees, was the defendant. Whether that pleased the other <lb/>
            ambassadors, you will know presently; for as yet I say <lb/>
            nothing about any one—I make no accusation-there is no <lb/>
            need for any of them to appear honest to-day by compulsion, <lb/>
            but of their own choice, and by having had no connexion <lb/>
            with the crimes. For that the acts done are disgraceful and <lb/>
            flagitious and not unpaid for, you have all seen: the thing <lb/>
            itself will disclose who have been concerned in them.2</p>
          <p>But, forsooth, in that interval they received the oaths from <lb/>
            the allies, or performed other duties. Very far from it. <lb/>
            Although they were absent for three whole months, and had <lb/>
            received from you a thousand drachms for their travelling <lb/>
            expenses, from not a single state, either on the journey there <lb/>
            or on the journey back, did they receive the oaths; but in <lb/>
            the inn before the temple of Castor and Pollux-if any of <note type="footnote"> 1 “ Fuisse tractum Thraciæ <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ Τείχη</foreign> dictum, ut in Belgio aunt les <lb/>

            were doubtless in court and supporting Æschines,) as being all more or <lb/>

            you has been at Pherme, he knows the place I mean-here the <lb/>
            oaths were administered, when Philip was marching hither <lb/>
            with his army, in a manner disgraceful, 0 Athenians, and <lb/>
            unworthy of you. Philip indeed would have given a great <lb/>
            deal to have it managed in this way. For when they were <lb/>
            unable to draw up the treaty as these men attempted at first, <lb/>
            excluding the Halians and Phocians, but Philocrates was <lb/>
            compelled by you to expunge that clause and insert expressly <lb/>
            the Athenians and allies of the Athenians, he did not wish <lb/>
            any of his own allies to have sworn that oath, (for then they <lb/>
            would not have marched with him to attack those possessions <lb/>
            of yours which he now holds, but would have made the oaths <lb/>
            an excuse,) nor did he wish them to witness the promises on <lb/>
            which he was obtaining the peace, nor to have it shown to <lb/>
            all, that in fact the Athenian commonwealth had not been <lb/>
            beaten in war, but it was Philip who desired peace, and was <lb/>
            making large promises to the Athenians if he could obtain <lb/>
            peace. So, for fear what I say might be publicly known, he <lb/>
            objected to these men going anywhere; and they did every­ <lb/>
            thing to gratify him with an ostentation of zeal and extrava­ <lb/>
            gant servility.</p>
          <p>I say then-when they are convicted of all these things- <lb/>
            having wasted the time, sacrificed the posts in Thrace, done <lb/>
            nothing that you directed or that your interests required, <lb/>
            brought false intelligence to Athens-how is it possible for <lb/>
            them to escape with intelligent and conscientious judges ? <lb/>
            To prove the truth of these statements, read first the decree <lb/>
            prescribing how the oath was to be administered, then the <lb/>

          <p>They can't deny they did all this to serve Philip-attend, <lb/>
            and you will see. When we started on the former embassy <lb/>
            for the peace, you sent a herald before us to stipulate for our <lb/>
            safe conduct. On that occasion, as soon as they arrived at <lb/>
            Oreus, they did not wait for the herald or create any delay, <lb/>
            but, though Halus 2 was under siege, they crossed over to it, <lb/>
            and again coming out of that city to Parmenio, who was <lb/>
            besieging it, they set off through the hostile army for Pagasæ, <lb/>
            and going on met the herald at Larissa: with such expedition <lb/>
            and diligence they proceeded then. Yet when there was peace <lb/>
            and every security for travelling, and your command to make <lb/>
            haste, it never occurred to them either to expedite their <lb/>
            journey or to go by sea. How came this about ? Because on <lb/>
            the former occasion it was Philip's interest that the peace <lb/>
            should be concluded as quickly as possible, but on this it was <lb/>
            for his advantage that the interval before demanding the oaths <lb/>
            should be as much as possible protracted. To show that <lb/>
            these statements are also true, here-take this deposition.</p>

            and hurried when they ought not even to have travelled3 <lb/>

          <p>During the time that we were there and loitering in Pella, <note type="footnote"> I Euclides was sent by the Athenians to remonstrate with Philip for <lb/>

            see what different employments we each chose for ourselves. <lb/>
            Mine was to deliver the captives and seek them out, to <lb/>
            expend money of my own, and request Philip to ransom them <lb/>
            with what he would have given in presents to us. What the <lb/>
            defendant made it his business to accomplish, you shall hear <lb/>
            immediately. What was it ? That Philip should make us a <lb/>
            common present of money. For you must know, among <lb/>
            other things, Philip sounded us all-in what way ?-by send­ <lb/>
            ing to each privately, and offering, 0 Athenians, a heap of <lb/>
            gold. Failing with one, no matter whom — (for it is not for <lb/>
            me to mention myself; the facts and circumstances will <lb/>
            show ;) — he thought that a common present would be ac­ <lb/>
            cepted without suspicion1 by all, and thus there would be <lb/>
            security for those who had privately sold themselves, if in <lb/>
            ever so small a degree we all joined in the acceptance. There­ <lb/>
            fore the offer was made, under pretence of being a gift of <lb/>
            hospitality. I having stopped it, these men divided the <lb/>
            money among themselves-this besides what they had had <lb/>
            before. Philip, when I requested him to expend it upon the <lb/>
            captives, could neither inform against these men with honour, <lb/>
            or say —“ Oh ! but this and that person have it "-nor yet <lb/>
            escape the outlay; so he consented, giving an evasive promise <lb/>
            to send them home by the Panathenæan festival. Read the <lb/>
            deposition of Apollophanes, then that of the other persons <lb/>

          <p>Now let me tell you how many of the prisoners I ransomed <lb/>
            myself. During the time that we stayed in Pella, before the <lb/>
            arrival of Philip, some of the captives who were out on bail, <lb/>
            doubting (I suppose) whether they should afterwards be able <lb/>
            to prevail on Philip, said they should like to ransom them­ <lb/>
            selves, and not be under an obligation to Philip; and they <lb/>
            applied for loans, one of three minas, another of five, and so <lb/>
            on, according to what each man's ransom came to. When <lb/>
            Philip therefore consented to redeem the rest, I called the <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">εύήθως</foreign>,—“ without scruple or misgiving-in simple and thoughtless <lb/>
            honesty of heart." Pabst: in gutmüthiger Einfalt. But Schaefer <lb/>

            men together, to whom I had advanced1 the money, and <lb/>

            ransomed (poor as they were) out of their own private means, <lb/>
            while the others expected to be released by Philip, I made <lb/>

            yourself ?”—remember, I had promised the men whom I ran­ <lb/>
            somed, that I would come and bring the redemption-money, <lb/>
            and do my best to deliver them. It would have been shame­ <lb/>
            ful then to break my word, and abandon fellow-citizens in <lb/>
            misfortune. But, had I got off the appointment, I could not <lb/>
            have made a private excursion there with propriety or safety: <lb/>
            for, but that I desired to release the captives, perdition seize <lb/>
            me, if I would have taken a very large sum of money to be <lb/>
            the colleague of these men. And I can prove it-for you <lb/>
            twice elected me for the third embassy, and I twice excused <lb/>
            myself; and during the whole of my absence on this I opposed <lb/>
            them in everything.</p>
          <p>Thus went your affairs, so far as I had the control on the <lb/>
            embassy: what these men carried by being the majority has <lb/>
            ruined all. Indeed all our measures would have been con­ <lb/>
            sistent with what I have just stated, had my advice been fol­ <lb/>
            lowed. For I was not such a wretched idiot, as to give money, <lb/>
            when I saw others receiving it, for the sake of standing well <lb/>
            with you, while things that might be accomplished without <lb/>
            expense, and that drew with them far greater advantages to <lb/>
            the commonwealth, I was in my wishes opposed to. I wished <lb/>
            for them earnestly, 0 Athenians; but these men, I trow, <lb/>
            were too many for me. <note type="footnote"> 1 Demosthenes had lent the money as a friend not <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐδάνεισε</foreign>). <lb/>
            We have not the same distinction in our language. To lend is indif­ <lb/>
            ferently used, whether the loan be with interest or without. </note> <pb n="170"/>
             </p>
          <p>Come now—see what have been the defendant's acts in <lb/>
            comparison with mine, and what those of Philocrates; for in <lb/>
            contrast they will appear more glaring. First, they excluded <lb/>
            the Phocians and the Halians and Cersobleptes from the <lb/>
            treaty, contrary to your decree and the declaration1 made to <lb/>
            you: secondly, they attempted to disturb and alter the <lb/>
            decree, which we had been commissioned to execute: further, <lb/>
            they set down the Cardians as allies of Philip. And the letter <lb/>
            written by me to you they determined not to send, while <lb/>
            they sent one written by themselves without a word of truth. <lb/>
            Then this brave fellow here said I had promised Philip to <lb/>
            overturn your democracy, because I denounced those acts, <lb/>
            not only regarding them as disgraceful, but fearing I might <lb/>
            be involved in the ruin of these men through their fault; <lb/>
            while he himself never ceased during the whole time holding <lb/>
            private interviews with Philip. And the rest I say nothing <lb/>
            about-but Dercylus, (not I,) with the assistance of this boy <lb/>
            of mine, watched him during the night at Pheræ, and having <lb/>
            caught him coming out of Philip's tent, told the boy to report <lb/>
            it to me and keep it in his own remembrance; and finally <lb/>
            this abominable and shameless fellow for a night and day <lb/>
            after our departure stayed behind with Philip.2 To prove <note type="footnote"> 1 I.e. by Philip's ambassadors, as Pabst understands it. Francis <lb/>
            renders it: "in contradiction to the assurances they themselves had <lb/>

            “ quoties nos a Philippo discederemus, sive interdiu sive noctu cum eo <lb/>
            congressi essemus, Æschines cum eo solus remanebat totum ilium reli­ <lb/>

            have been, that he went in a boat by night down the river Lydias, oil <lb/>
            purpose to assist Philip in writing the letter. If this was the charge, it <lb/>
            must have appeared in the deposition read to the jury. Æschines ridi­ <lb/>
            cules the idea of it being necessary for Philip to have his assistance <lb/>
            in composing the letter, when there was Python of Byzantium and <lb/>
            the exile Leosthenes, either of them fully capable of writing it; and <lb/>
            indeed Philip could easily have done it himself. And it would have <lb/>
            been absurd (he argues) to go by night for such a purpose, when the day <lb/>
            would have suited quite as well. Yet neither of these arguments <lb/>
            touches the point of the matter; for it might be necessary to Philip's <lb/>
            objects to concert things with the person who was to be his agent at <lb/>
            Athens, and the night might, for more than one reason, be more suit­ <lb/>
            able than the day. He proceeds next to confute the charge, by direct <lb/>

          <p>With what annoyances and troubles I was beset during the <lb/>
            whole of the expedition, you have seen. You may guess in­ <lb/>
            deed what they did in the neighbourhood of their paymaster, <note type="footnote"> Philip's company, because he lodged in the same apartment with them, <lb/>
            and was never absent for a single night. The value of such evidence <lb/>
            depends in some measure upon the terms in which it was expressed; <lb/>
            but the proof of an alibi, without cross-examination, could never be <lb/>
            satisfactory. </note><note type="footnote"> The use of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπελείφθη</foreign> in this passage tends certainly to confirm the <lb/>
            translation of Pabst and Francis in the former passage (ante, p. 131). </note><note type="footnote"> 1 To make this passage intelligible, it is necessary to explain the <lb/>
            method of giving evidence in Athenian courts of law. Any party <lb/>
            intending to call a witness in court drew up his evidence in the shape <lb/>
            of a deposition, and summoned him before the magistrate who had <lb/>
            cognisance of the cause. The deposition having been sworn to was put <lb/>
            into a box, together with other documents in the cause, to be produced <lb/>
            when the trial came on before the jury. On the day of trial the witness <lb/>
            again attended, his deposition was read out, and he confirmed it by <lb/>
            signifying his assent. No vivâ voce testimony (in our sense of the term) <lb/>
            was permitted. It was required to be in writing, in order that there <lb/>
            might be no mistake about what the witness deposed to, and to afford <lb/>
            the opposite party the means of obtaining redress in case he lost his <lb/>
            cause by false evidence. A party might be a witness for himself; and <lb/>
            then be prepared his own deposition in the same way, and, having sworn <lb/>
            to it, produced and had it read in court, making himself answerable, <lb/>
            like any other witness, to a charge of perjury. </note><note type="footnote"> Where a man called a doubtful or unfriendly witness, he drew up a <lb/>
            statement of the facts which he supposed him capable of proving, and, <lb/>
            having caused it to be read by the clerk of the court, he asked the <lb/>
            witness whether he would swear to it. The witness was then required <lb/>
            either to give his testimony to that effect, or swear that the statement <lb/>
            was untrue, or not true to his knowledge. </note><note type="footnote"> While some advantages attended this method of proceeding, and, <lb/>
            among others, a saving of time, (for the evidence was all produced and <lb/>
            read during the course of the party's address to the jury, though ex­ <lb/>
            cluded from the measurement of time allotted to him,) there were other <lb/>
            obvious disadvantages, one of which was the absence of cross-examina­ <lb/>
            tion, and another (in the case of a hostile witness) was the extreme <lb/>
            difficulty of preparing such a deposition as he could not escape from. </note> <lb/>

            when such are their doings before your eyes, in whose power <lb/>
            it is either to reward or to punish.</p>
          <p>I will now reckon up the charges from the beginning, to <lb/>
            show you I have performed all that I promised in the outset <lb/>
            of my speech. I have shown by the evidence not of words, <lb/>
            but of the facts themselves, that his reports have been utterly <lb/>
            false and that he imposed on you. I have shown, that owing <lb/>
            to him you refused to hear the truth from me, being in­ <lb/>
            fluenced by his promises and assurances; that all his advice <lb/>
            was contrary to what it should have been: that he opposed <lb/>
            the peace of the allies and supported that of Philocrates; he <lb/>
            wasted the time, to prevent your marching to Phocis, even if <lb/>
            you desired it; he has committed many grievous things <lb/>
            besides during his absence; he has betrayed and sold every­ <lb/>
            thing, taken bribes, stopped short of nothing that is villanous. <lb/>
            All these things I promised in the beginning; all I have <lb/>
            made out. Mark then what follows-this that I have next <lb/>
            to say to you is simple :—You have sworn to give your verdict <lb/>
            according to the laws and the decrees of the people and the <lb/>
            council of five hundred: the defendant is proved by his whole <lb/>
            conduct as ambassador to have violated the laws, the decrees, <lb/>
            the obligations of justice: it is fit therefore he should be con­ <lb/>
            victed before an intelligent jury.</p>
          <p>Were he guilty of nothing else, two of his acts are sufficient <lb/>
            to kill him: for he has betrayed not only the Phocians, but <lb/>
            Thrace also to Philip. Two places in the world more impor­ <lb/>
            tant to our commonwealth could not be pointed out than <lb/>
            Thermopylae by land, and the Hellespont by sea: both which <lb/>
            together have these men disgracefully sold and delivered into <lb/>
            Philip's hands against you. What an offence even this is, <lb/>
            without anything further-the sacrificing of Thrace and the <lb/>
            Fortresses-would be an infinite topic of discussion: and it <lb/>
            were easy to show, how many persons have on that account <lb/>
            been sentenced to death before you, or incurred heavy fines- <lb/>
            Ergophilus, Cephisodotus, Timomachus, in ancient times Er­ <lb/>
            gocles, Dionysius 1, and others, all of whom together (I may <note type="footnote"> 1 As to the first three persons named in the text, see vol. i. pp. 271 <lb/>
            —274. </note><note type="footnote"> Ergocles is a person against whom there is an extant oration of <lb/>
            Lysias, and who, it appears, was condemned by the Athenians for pecu­ <lb/>
            lation. Of Dionysius nothing is known. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="173"/>
            nearly say) have injured the commonwealth less than this <lb/>
            man. But then, 0 Athenians, you were still, on calculation, <lb/>
            wary and provident of danger: while now, what for the day <lb/>
            gives you no trouble, no present annoyance, you disregard; <lb/>
            and here you pass idle votes :-that Philip shall take the <lb/>
            oaths to Cersobleptes—that he shall not interfere in Amphic­ <lb/>
            tyonic business-that you will amend the peace. But there <lb/>
            would have been no necessity for any of these decrees, if the <lb/>
            defendant had chosen to sail and perform his duty: what <lb/>
            might have been preserved by sailing, he has lost by advising <lb/>
            a land-journey; what might have been saved by telling truth, <lb/>
            he has lost by lying.</p>
          <p>He will make it a grievance presently, as I am informed, <lb/>
            that he should be the only orator in the assembly who is <lb/>
            called to account for words. I will not press the argument, <lb/>
            that all men should be made responsible for their words, if <lb/>
            they speak for lucre; but I say this-If Æschines in his <lb/>
            private capacity played the fool or made any slip, don't be <lb/>
            over-nice; let it pass, forgive him: but if in the character of <lb/>
            ambassador he has for lucre's sake purposely deceived you, <lb/>
            don't let him off, don't tolerate that he is not to be brought <lb/>
            to trial for what he said. For what else ought we to call <lb/>
            ambassadors to account but for words ? Ambassadors have <lb/>
            not galleys or posts or soldiers or citadels under their control, <lb/>
            (for no one entrusts ambassadors with these things,) but only <lb/>
            words and times. With respect to time-if he never de­ <lb/>
            stroyed the opportunities of the state, he is innocent; if he <lb/>
            has destroyed them, he is guilty. And as to words-if his <lb/>
            reports have been true or serviceable, let him be acquitted; <lb/>
            if false and corrupt and injurious, let him be convicted. A <lb/>
            man can do you no greater wrong than by telling falsehoods: <lb/>
            for where the government depends on words, how is it pos­ <lb/>
            sible, if these be untrue, to carry it on safely? And if <lb/>
            speakers will even take bribes for the interest of the enemy, <lb/>
            how can you avoid being in peril? Nor indeed is it the <lb/>
            same thing to rob oligarchs or despots of their opportunities, <lb/>
            as it is to rob you; nor anything like. For in those govern­ <lb/>
            ments, I take it, everything is done sharply according to order: <lb/>
            but with you, first the council must hear of all matters and <lb/>
            frame their previous order, and that only after publication of <lb/>
             <pb n="174"/>
            notice for heralds and embassies,1 not always; then they must <lb/>
            convene an assembly, and that only when it is allowable by <lb/>
            the laws: then your honest counsellors must get the day, and <lb/>
            prevail over those who ignorantly or wickedly oppose them. <lb/>
            And after all this, when a resolution has passed, and its ad­ <lb/>
            vantage is apparent, time has to be allowed for the indigence <lb/>
            of the multitude to provide themselves with what is needful, <lb/>
            that they may be able to execute your resolve. A man, I say, <lb/>
            who destroys these times of action in a government such as <lb/>
            ours, has done more than destroy times of action; he has <lb/>
            absolutely robbed you of your main chance.</p>
          <p>There is a ready argument however for all who wish to <lb/>
            deceive you—“ the disturbers of the commonwealth !-the <lb/>
            persons who prevent Philip from doing the state a service!" <lb/>
            To them I shall offer not a word in reply, but read you <lb/>
            Philip's letters, and remind you of the occasions on which in <lb/>
            every instance you have been cheated, that you may see, by <lb/>
            cajoling you, he has forfeited that boastful title that one got <lb/>
            sick of hearing.2</p>

            sacrifice in common, and sup with each other, and pour liba­ <lb/>
            tions together; and the good do not on this account imitate <lb/>

            (without exception) who ever privately visited him, let me tell <lb/>
            you a little circumstance unconnected with the embassy.</p>
          <p>When Philip took Olynthus, he celebrated Olympic games, <lb/>
            and invited all kinds of artists8 to the sacrifice and the <lb/>
            festival. While he was feasting them and crowning the con­ <lb/>

            cutting off the thumbs of the Peloponnesian captives. He was sus­ <lb/>
            pected however of having betrayed the fleet to the enemy, and after­ <lb/>

            etwa nur die gegen einzelne Bürger. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Theatrical people were often specially called artists among the <lb/>

            friend of Demosthenes, who first directed his attention to his faults in <lb/>
            elocution, and showed him how to overcome them. Plutarch, in the <lb/>
            Life of Demosthenes, relates that the young orator, after making one of <lb/>
            his earliest essays at speaking in the assembly, and having been in <lb/>
            received by his audience, was returning home in a melancholy humour, <lb/>
            when he met Satyrus, and complained to him of his misfortune, saying <lb/>
            how hard it was that, after having spent so much time in the study of <lb/>
            oratory, he was unable to please the people of Athens: the most igno­ <lb/>
            rant and illiterate persons were heard with pleasure, while he was not <lb/>
            listened to. "Aye," said Satyrus; " but I can remedy this. Just repeat <lb/>
            me some verses of Sophocles or Euripides." Demosthenes did so, but <lb/>
            without that accompaniment of graceful action and pronunciation, by <lb/>
            which Satyrus was accustomed to charm his hearers on the stage. <lb/>
            Satyrus then repeated the same verses himself, showing how it ought to <lb/>
            be done, and making the orator see his own deficiencies. Demosthenes <lb/>
            had the wisdom to profit by this lesson, and from that hour set himself <lb/>
            resolutely to work to overcome all his natural impediments, to perfect <lb/>
            his organs of speech, and to acquire the external graces of address and </note> <lb/>

            only person who preferred no request, whether it was that he <lb/>
            had observed in him any meanness or discourtesy towards <lb/>
            himself. Satyrus (they say) replied, that he wanted none of <lb/>
            the things which the others asked, that what he should like <lb/>
            to propose it would be very easy for Philip to oblige him <lb/>
            with, but he was fearful of being refused. Philip bade him <lb/>
            speak out, assuring him in handsome terms, that there was <lb/>
            nothing he would not do; upon which (they say) he declared, <lb/>
            that Apollophanes of Pydna was his friend; that, after he had <lb/>
            been assassinated, his relations in alarm secretly removed his <lb/>
            daughters, then little children, to Olynthus. " They," said he, <lb/>
            “ now that the city is taken, have become prisoners, and are <lb/>
            in your hands: they are of marriageable age. Give me them, <lb/>
            I pray and beseech you. Yet I wish you to hear and under­ <lb/>
            stand, what sort of a present you will give me, if you do, give <lb/>
            it. I myself shall derive no profit from the grant; for I shall <lb/>
            give them in marriage with portions, and not suffer them to <lb/>
            be treated in any manner unworthy of myself or their father." <lb/>
            When the company at the banquet heard this, there was a <lb/>
            clapping of hands and tumult of applause from all sides, <lb/>
            insomuch that Philip was touched, and gave him the girls. <lb/>
            Yet this Apollophanes was one of the persons who killed <lb/>
            Philip's brother Alexander.1</p>
          <p>Now let us contrast with this banquet of Satyrus another <lb/>
            banquet, which these men held in Macedonia; and see if it <lb/>
            has any likeness or resemblance.</p>
          <p>These men were invited to the house of Xenophron, the <lb/>
            son of Phædimus,2 one of the Thirty, and off they went. I <lb/>
            did not go. When they came to the drinking, he introduces <lb/>
            a certain Olynthian woman, good-looking, and well-born also <lb/>
            and modest, as the case proved. At first (I believe) they only <note type="footnote"> manner. He even shut himself up, refusing to see any of his friends, <lb/>
            and keeping his head shaved for several months together, that he might <lb/>
            have perfect leisure to pursue his training without interruption. In the <lb/>
            result he acquired a style of delivery which fully recompensed him for <lb/>
            all this exertion, and proved the justice of the player's advice. </note><note type="footnote"> The story which Demosthenes tells appears to have been introduced <lb/>
            more for the purpose of doing honour to Satyrus, than for any purpose <lb/>
            connected with the trial; and we may regard it as being really a tribute <lb/>
            of gratitude to the man to whom he was so much indebted. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 See Vol. T. Appendix I. pp. 232, 250. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 In the list of the thirty tyrants given by Xenophon, occurs the <lb/>

            made her drink quietly and eat dessert; so Iatrocles told me <lb/>
            the next day: but as it went on, and they became heated, <lb/>
            they ordered her to sit down and sing a song. The woman <lb/>
            was in a sad way; she neither would do it nor could; where­ <lb/>
            upon the defendant and Phrynon said it was an insult, and <lb/>
            not to be tolerated that a captive woman, one of the accursed <lb/>
            and pestilent Olynthians, should give herself airs; and...... <lb/>
            " Call the boy;” and—“ A lash here." A servant came with a <lb/>
            whip: and as they were in liquor, I imagine, and it took but <lb/>
            little to exasperate them, upon her saying something or other <lb/>
            and bursting into tears, the servant rips off her tunic and <lb/>
            gives her several cuts on the back. The woman, maddened <lb/>
            by the pain and the whole treatment, jumps up, throws her­ <lb/>
            self at the knees of Iatrocles, and overturns the table: and <lb/>
            had he not snatched her away, she would have perished by <lb/>
            drunken violence; for the drunkenness of this scoundrel is <lb/>
            terrible. There was a talk about this female in Arcadia <lb/>
            before the Ten Thousand; and Diophantus made a report to <lb/>
            you, which I will compel him now to give evidence of; and <lb/>
            there was much talk in Thessaly and everywhere.1 <note type="footnote"> 1 In support of this charge, as it appears, Demosthenes gives no <lb/>
            evidence, though he asserts that he heard the story from Iatrocles, whom <lb/>
            he calls as his witness for another purpose. Æschines declares the whole <lb/>
            story to be a fabrication, and produces the evidence of an Olynthian, <lb/>
            named Aristophanes, to prove that Demosthenes had offered him a bribe <lb/>
            to come forward as a witness, and that he had refused. It is remark­ <lb/>
            able however, that Æschines produces none of the ambassadors who <lb/>
            were present at the party to disprove the statement. (See his reply, pp. <lb/>
            48, 49.) In the opening of his speech Æschines adverts to the indig­ <lb/>
            nant reception which the charge had met with from the jury, stating <lb/>
            that they had hissed the accuser, and expressed their confidence in his <lb/>
            innocence. This is apparently confirmed by Ulpian, who states that <lb/>
            when the charge was preferred, Eubulus instantly got up and appealed <lb/>
            to the jury, whether they would permit his friend to be slandered in <lb/>
            such a way; the jury then rose and stopped it. </note><note type="footnote"> Many topics of remark suggest themselves as we peruse these contra­ <lb/>
            dictory statements. In the first place, Demosthenes was wrong Mad <lb/>
            unfair in lugging in this story at all; and the Athenians, if they stopped <lb/>
            him, did perfectly right, though they were not always so scrupulous <lb/>
            about what the speakers chose to say. The tale itself, apart from some <lb/>
            exaggerations, is not so very improbable. Demosthenes may have made <lb/>
            some inquiries of Aristophanes respecting the parentage and condition <lb/>
            of the female; but he could not have been a witness to the facts them­ <lb/>
            selves which took place at Xenophron's house. It is an odd thing that <lb/>
            AEschines should have been prepared with the evidence of Aristophanes ; </note> <pb n="179"/>

          <p>Notwithstanding his guilty conscience, this polluted wretch <lb/>
            will dare to look you in the face, will raise his voice presently <lb/>
            and talk about the life that he has lived; which chokes me to <lb/>
            listen to. Don't these people know, that in early life you <lb/>
            used to read the books for your mother at her initiations, and <lb/>
            as a boy were rolled about among orgiasts and drunkards ?— <lb/>
            that afterwards you were an office under-clerk, and did dirty <lb/>
            work for two or three drachms ?-that it is but lately you <lb/>
            got a wretched livelihood for your services as third-rate <lb/>
            player on the boards of other men ?1 What sort of a life can <lb/>
            you mention which you have not lived, when that which you <lb/>
            have lived appears to be of such a character? But his <lb/>
            assurance forsooth ! He brought another man to trial before <lb/>
            you for infamous practices ! But of that by-and-by. Read <lb/>

          <p>Such being the number, men of the jury, such the charac­ <lb/>

            including every species of criminality-a receiver of bribes, a <note type="footnote"> and it seems like a confirmation of what Demosthenes says, that the <lb/>
            story had been talked about. The cruel treatment of the woman would <lb/>
            have been equally reprehensible, whether she was an Olynthian or not, <lb/>
            though the prejudice which Demosthenes helped to raise against his <lb/>
            opponent might have been enhanced by that circumstance; and it is <lb/>
            strange that Æschines brings no witness to disprove the occurrence. </note><note type="footnote"> These and many other points may naturally occur to the reader, but <lb/>
            it is perhaps waste of time to dwell upon them too long. The difficulty <lb/>
            of ascertaining the truth is increased by the absence of the depositions, <lb/>
            and the uncertainty how far the speeches which have come down to us <lb/>
            are correct reports of the speeches which were actually delivered; for <lb/>
            even the orators themselves, when they published their own speeches, <lb/>
            may have added or omitted what suited their purpose. The discre­ <lb/>
            pancies which we find in these very passages, between what Demosthenes <lb/>
            says, and what Æschines represents him to have said, may be accounted <lb/>
            for possibly in this way. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Literally, “ in the training-rooms of other choirmasters-choregi.” <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Χορηγεῖον</foreign>, or <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰορήγιον</foreign>, was the place which the choregus provided to <lb/>

            the most heinous crimes are included ;—from none of these <lb/>
            charges will he defend himself, no plain and honest defence <lb/>
            will he be able to plead: what I have heard he intends to <lb/>
            say amounts almost to madness, though perhaps a person <lb/>
            who has no other plea to urge is obliged to employ what <lb/>
            artifices he can. I am told he will say, that I have been a <lb/>
            partner in all that I denounce, that I approved of all and <lb/>
            cooperated with him, but I have suddenly changed and be­ <lb/>
            come accuser. This is no fair or proper justification of his <lb/>
            conduct, but only an accusation of me: for if I have so acted, <lb/>
            I am a good-for-nothing man, and yet the proceedings are <lb/>
            none the better for that; quite otherwise. However, I con­ <lb/>
            sider it my duty to show to you, both that the assertion, if <lb/>
            he makes it, will be false, and what the fair line of defence is. <lb/>
            The fair and honest defence is, to show either that the things <lb/>
            alleged against him have not been done, or that, being done, <lb/>
            they benefit the state. Neither of these points can he esta­ <lb/>
            blish. For neither surely can he say, that it is to our advan­ <lb/>
            tage for the Phocians to be destroyed and Philip to hold <lb/>
            Thermopylae and the Thebans to be strong and troops to be <lb/>
            in Eubœa and forming designs on Megara and the peace to <lb/>
            be unsworn;1 the contrary to all which his reports to you <lb/>
            announced as being to your advantage and about to take <lb/>
            place: nor can he persuade you, who have yourselves seen <lb/>
            and known all the circumstances, that these results have not <lb/>
            been accomplished. It remains then for me to prove that I <lb/>
            have had no connexion with these men in anything. Would <lb/>
            you like me to pass over all the rest-how I spoke against <lb/>
            them before you, how I quarrelled on the journey, how I have <lb/>
            opposed them all along-and produce these men themselves <lb/>
            as witnesses, that my acts and theirs have been entirely <lb/>
            different, and that they have received money to be your <lb/>

          <p>What man in the commonwealth should you say was the <lb/>

            men call spiritless and cowardly with the mob, whilst I call <lb/>

            never have I done violence to your inclinations. Well: in <lb/>
            all the assemblies, whenever there has been a discussion upon <lb/>
            these matters, you hear me always both accusing and con­ <lb/>
            victing these men, and positively declaring that they have <lb/>
            taken money and sold all the interests of the state. And <lb/>
            none of them hearing my statements ever contradicted them, <lb/>
            or opened his mouth or showed himself. What can be the <lb/>
            reason that the most odious blackguards in the common­ <lb/>
            wealth and the loudest speakers are overpowered by me, who <lb/>
            am the timidest of men, and speak no louder than any one <lb/>
            else ? It is that truth is strong, and, on the other hand, the <lb/>
            consciousness of having sold your interests is weak. This <lb/>
            takes off from the audacity of these men, this warps their <lb/>
            tongue, stops their mouths, chokes and keeps them silent. <lb/>
            You know of course, on the late occasion in Piræus,1 when <lb/>

            out that he would impeach and indict me, with cries of <lb/>
            " Shame ! shame !" Yet all that is the prelude to numerous <lb/>
            contests and arguments, whereas these are simple, and per­ <lb/>
            haps but two or three words, which a slave bought yesterday <lb/>

            it himself.”—Nothing of this kind did he say or utter; none <lb/>
            of you heard him; but he threatened something different. <lb/>
            Why? Because he was conscious of guilt, and not inde­ <lb/>

          <p>The strongest point of all, a matter not of argument but of <lb/>
            fact, I am about to mention :-Upon my offering to do what <lb/>
            was just, namely, as I had been twice ambassador, to render <lb/>
            my account twice, Æschines the defendant came up to the <lb/>
            auditors with divers witnesses, and warned them not to sum­ <lb/>
            mon me into court, on the ground that I had passed my <lb/>
            audit and had no further liability. And the thing was beyond <lb/>
            measure ridiculous. What was the meaning of it ? He having <lb/>
            rendered his account of the former embassy, which no one <lb/>
            arraigned, did not wish to attend a fresh audit for that which <lb/>
            he is now tried upon, which included all his misdeeds: but if <lb/>
            I attended twice, the consequence would be that he too must <lb/>
            come into court again; therefore he would not let them <lb/>
            summon me. Now, men of Athens, this circumstance proves <lb/>
            both points clearly to you, both that Æschines has con­ <lb/>
            demned himself, so that none of you can conscientiously <lb/>
            acquit him now, and that he will not utter a word of truth <lb/>
            about me; for had he anything to say, he would have come <lb/>
            forward with it then and accused me, never have given notice <lb/>
            not to summon me into court. In support of my statements, <lb/>
            call the witnesses to them.</p>

          <p>Should he speak any slander about me foreign to the <lb/>
            embassy, on many accounts you should refuse to hear him. <lb/>
            I am not on my trial to-day; and after this no water is <lb/>

          <p>You see, I, because I was conscious of no wrong, thought <lb/>
            proper to render my account, and submit to all that the <lb/>
            laws required: Æschines did the reverse. How then can his <lb/>
            actions and mine have been the same ? or how can he pos­ <lb/>
            sibly maintain before you what he has never even alleged <lb/>
            against me before? Surely he cannot. He will, however; <lb/>
            and verily I don't wonder. For you surely know this--that <lb/>
            since the creation of man, and since trials have been insti­ <lb/>
            tuted, no one ever was found guilty confessing his crime: <lb/>
            no; they put on a bold face, deny the charge, tell lies, invent <lb/>
            excuses, do anything to escape punishment. 3</p>
          <p>You must not be duped by anything of this sort to-day, <lb/>
            but decide the case by your own knowledge, and pay no heed <lb/>
            to my statements or the defendant's, no, nor to the witnesses <lb/>
            whom he will have ready to. prove what he likes, with Philip <lb/>
            for his paymaster; (you'll see how promptly they will give <lb/>
            evidence for him:) neither care whether AEschines has a loud <lb/>
            and fine voice, or I a poor one. For it is not your business, <lb/>
            if you are wise, to have a trial of orators or speeches to-day, <lb/>
            but to regard the dire and shameful ruin of your affairs,: and <lb/>
            to cast back the infamy upon its authors, having inquired <lb/>
            into these doings that are within your own knowledge. What <lb/>

            the fortresses in Thrace and that sallying-places would be <lb/>

            to so many disgraces incur the sin of perjury: for he does <lb/>
            you no wrong; I am a fool and a madman to accuse him. <lb/>
            But if just the reverse-if they spoke in the kindest manner <lb/>
            of Philip, saying that he loved the commonwealth, he would <lb/>
            save the Phocians, he would humble the pride of Thebes, <lb/>
            yet more, he would confer benefits on you beyond the value <lb/>
            of Amphipolis, if he obtained the peace, and would restore <lb/>
            Eubœa and Oropus—if after saying and promising all this <lb/>
            they have cheated and cajoled you, and all but stripped you <lb/>
            of Attica, pronounce your verdict against him, and let it not <lb/>
            be that, in addition to the other outrages put upon you, (for <lb/>
            I know not what else to call them,) you, for the bribes taken <lb/>
            by these men, carry home the curse and the perjury.1</p>
          <p>Consider again, men of the jury: for what object could I <lb/>
            have chosen to accuse these men, if they were innocent? <lb/>
            You can find none. Is it pleasant to have many enemies t <lb/>
            It is not even safe. Was there any quarrel subsisting be­ <lb/>
            tween Æschines and me None. What then ? You feared <lb/>
            for yourself, and through cowardice thought this was your <lb/>
            security:-that I have heard he says.—Well, but without <lb/>
            there being any danger or crime, Æschines, as you allege !2 <note type="footnote"> This is a fine sentence, pregnant with meaning. Don't let it <lb/>
            happen, says the orator, that, instead of taking vengeance on these men <lb/>

            acquit Æschines, the curse to which he is liable (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ταῖς ἀραῖς ἔνοχος</foreign>, p. 404, <lb/>
            orig.) will justly be transferred to you, and by violating your oaths as <lb/>
            jurors and giving a verdict contrary to the evidence you will have <lb/>
            incurred the crime of perjury. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The supposed assertion of Æschines involved the assumption of <lb/>
            crime having been committed, which was adverse to his case. If the <lb/>
            ambassadors had done nothing wrong, as Æschines would make out, <lb/>
            then Demosthenes could have had nothing to fear, and the last assigned <lb/>

            Should he repeat that, consider, men of the jury, whether for <lb/>
            crimes, which I who am innocent feared would be my ruin <lb/>
            through those persons-what ought they to suffer who are <lb/>
            the guilty parties ?1 But it is for no such reason. Wherefore <lb/>
            then do I accuse you ? Vexatiously, forsooth, that I may get <lb/>
            money from you ! And pray, was it better for me to receive <lb/>
            a large sum, as large as any of these men, from Philip who <lb/>
            offered it, and have both him and these for my friends, (for <lb/>
            they would, they would have been my friends, if I had been <lb/>
            their accomplices: even now the feud between us is not here­ <lb/>

            or to beg from them a portion of their receipts, and be at <lb/>
            enmity both with Philip and them?—and while I ransomed <lb/>
            the prisoners at such an expense out of my own means, to ask <lb/>
            these men for a disgraceful pittance which made them my <lb/>
            enemies? Impossible. I reported what was true, and ab­ <lb/>
            stained from taking presents out of regard to justice and <lb/>
            truth and my future life, believing that, if I was virtuous, I <lb/>
            should be honoured among you no less than certain other <lb/>
            people,2 and that I must not barter away my public spirit for <lb/>
            any lucre: and these men I abhor, because I saw them in <lb/>
            the embassy to be villanous and execrable, and I have been <lb/>
            deprived too of my personal distinctions, 3 since through the <lb/>
            corruption of these men your displeasure has'fallen upon the <lb/>
            whole embassy: and I accuse now and am come to the audit <lb/>
            foreseeing the future, and wishing to have it determined by <lb/>
            the verdict of this tribunal, that my actions have been the <lb/>
            opposite of theirs. And I fear, I fear, (all my thoughts shall <lb/>

            nothing they do even here can escape him, and they regard <lb/>

            reason? I will tell you; and pray be not offended at my <lb/>
            speaking the truth. It is because Philip, I take it, having <lb/>

            that do him good, and hates those that do the contrary; <lb/>

          <p>Æschines never prosecuted this man on the charge of <lb/>
            sending his son to Philip for dishonour. But if one being in <lb/>

          <p>Now let me speak of the entertainment and the decree: <lb/>
            I had nearly forgotten what was most material to say to you. <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τὴν πόλιν ἀγνοεῖν</foreign> is explained thus by Reiske: "non nosse mores <lb/>

            sthenes, in ransoming the prisoners, &amp;c. His enemies represented him <lb/>
            as a fool, who threw away his money, and even didn't know how to <lb/>
            throw it away. Auger: " qui ne savoit oil jeter son argent." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 It may seem strange to an English reader that Demosthenes should <lb/>
            call witnesses to a fact so remote from the point at issue. But the Athe­ <lb/>

            show the general character of the parties. Demosthenes seeks to create <lb/>
            a'prejudice against Æschines, as being connected with such an infamous <lb/>
            person as Phrynon, and he turns this to still better account, when he <lb/>
            comments upon his prosecution of Timarchus. This (says he) could <lb/>
            only have been for the purpose of screening himself. Had his motive <lb/>
            been the pure love of virtue, he would have proceeded against Phrynon <lb/>

            either spoken or done wrong by these persons was known, <lb/>
            I according to customary usage commended and invited <lb/>
            them to the city-hall. And what is more, I entertained <lb/>
            Philip's ambassadors, and very splendidly too, 0 Athenians: <lb/>

          <p>Perhaps his brothers Philochares and Aphobetus1 will <lb/>
            plead for him. To both of them there is much that you <lb/>
            may with justice reply: (I must speak freely, 0 Athenians, <lb/>
            without any reserve:)—Aphobetus and Philochares! you <lb/>
            being a painter of perfume-boxes and drums, your brothers <lb/>
            under-clerks and common persons; (there is no reproach in <lb/>
            these things, yet they hardly deserve a general's rank;) we <lb/>
            dignified you with embassies, generalships, and the highest <lb/>
            honours. Now supposing that none of you committed any <lb/>
            crime, we should have nothing to be grateful for to you, but <lb/>
            you for these things ought to be grateful to us; for we, <lb/>
            passing by many persons more worthy of honour, exalted <lb/>
            Tou. But if in the very exercise of your dignities one of you <lb/>
            has committed crime, and crime too of such a nature, don't <note type="footnote"> 1 See Appendix II. </note> <lb/>

            you much more deserve execration than pardon? Much more, <lb/>
            in my opinion.</p>
          <p>They will be violent perhaps, with their loud voices and <lb/>
            impudence, and with the plea that " it is pardonable to assist <lb/>
            a brother." But don't you give way: remember, while it is <lb/>
            their duty to regard Æschines, it is yours to regard the laws <lb/>
            and the whole commonwealth, and (above all) the oaths that <lb/>
            you have yourselves sworn as jurors. If indeed they have <lb/>
            requested any of you to save the defendant, see whether they <lb/>
            mean, in case he is not shown to have injured the common­ <lb/>
            wealth, or even in case he is. If they mean in case of inno­ <lb/>
            cence, I am also for saving him; if unconditionally and <lb/>
            however guilty he has been, they have asked you to commit <lb/>
            perjury. For though the ballot is secret, it will not be hidden <lb/>
            from the gods. Most wisely was it seen by him that enacted <lb/>
            the law of secret voting, that none of these men1 will know <lb/>
            which of you has obliged him, but the gods and the divine <lb/>
            spirit will know who has voted iniquitously: from whom it <lb/>
            is better for each of you to secure good hopes for himself and <lb/>
            his children by giving a righteous and proper judgment, than <lb/>
            to confer a secret and uncertain obligation upon these men, <lb/>
            and to acquit a person who has given evidence against him­ <lb/>
            self. For what stronger witness, Æschines, can I produce, to <lb/>
            prove your misconduct as ambassador, than you against your­ <lb/>
            self? You that thought it necessary to involve in such a <lb/>
            dreadful calamity the man who would have brought some of <lb/>
            your deeds to light, certainly expected some heavy punish­ <lb/>
            ment yourself, should the people hear what you had done.</p>
          <p>This proceeding, if you are wise, will turn out to his own <lb/>
            prejudice, not only on this account, that it is a flagrant indi­ <lb/>
            cation of what his acts as ambassador have been, but because <lb/>
            in conducting the accusation he used those arguments which <lb/>
            stand good against him now: for surely the same principles, <lb/>
            which you laid down when you prosecuted Timarchus, are <lb/>
            available also for others against yourself. You then said to <lb/>
            the jury—" Demosthenes will defend him, and will arraign <lb/>
            my conduct as ambassador: and then, if he misleads you by <lb/>
            his speech, he will brag and go about saying-how ? what do <note type="footnote"> 1 Tourer means here not only Æschines and his colleagues, but all <lb/>

            you think?1 I led the jurors right away from the question, and <lb/>
            stole the case out of their hands." Don't yourself act thus. <lb/>
            Confine your defence to the subject of your trial. When you <lb/>
            were prosecuting him, then was the time for accusing and <lb/>
            saying what you pleased.</p>
          <p>Again you recited before the jury, having no witness to <lb/>
            bring in support of your charge against the accused- <lb/>
            Rumour which many people noise abroad <lb/>
            Not wholly dies: a goddess eke is she.2</p>
          <p>Well, Æschines; and all these people say that you have <lb/>
            received money from the embassy; so that against you too, I <lb/>
            should think, Rumour which many people noise abroad not <lb/>
            wholly dies. For inasmuch as more accuse you than him, see <lb/>
            how the matter stands. Timarchus even his neighbours did <lb/>
            not all know; but of you ambassadors there is no Greek or <lb/>
            barbarian who does not say, that you have received money <lb/>
            from the embassy. If rumour therefore is true, that of the <note type="footnote"> 1 These words, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πῶς; τί</foreign>; which have puzzled the critics, arc understood <lb/>
            by moat to be put in the mouth of Demosthenes. Perhaps the better <lb/>
            way is to understand them as referring to what precedes, thus: " how <lb/>
            will he brag ! what will he say ? why, as follows." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 These lines are from Hesiod, Opera et Dies, 761. Æschines, in the <lb/>
            passage referred to (cont. Timarch. 18), quotes also Homer and Euripides <lb/>
            on the subject of Fame or Rumour. Compare the celebrated lines of <lb/>
            Virgil, Æneid IV. 173. </note><note type="footnote"> Whether this goddess, the personification of common rumour or <lb/>
            report, should in English be rendered Fame, as it more generally is, <lb/>
            or Rumour, I have entertained some doubt: Fame is nearer in point of <lb/>
            form to the Greek and Latin original; and it may be said that Rumour, <lb/>
            derived from the Latin Rumor, cannot so well be made feminine. But <lb/>
            on the other hand, the meaning of our Fame is not so like the Fama <lb/>
            of Virgil and Hesiod as Rumour is. And with respect to the gender, <lb/>
            we. have as much right to follow the French Rumeur as the Latin <lb/>
            Rumor, or perhaps to exercise an arbitrary discretion upon such a <lb/>
            matter. Shakspeare, no doubt, makes his Rumour a male personage, <lb/>
            in the Introduction to Henry IV. Part 2, and one of a character more <lb/>
            like Virgil's than Hesiod's deity. The lines are quite equal to Virgil's. <lb/>

            multitude is against you all; and that such rumour is cre­ <lb/>

          <p>And besides, he got up a number of Iambics, and repeated <lb/>

            —" don't you know," said he, " what sort of a person to con­ <lb/>
            sider him?" Well, Æschines: these iambics will suit me <lb/>
            now against you; and I shall speak fitly and properly, if I <lb/>
            recite to the jury-Who loves the fellowship of Philocrates, <lb/>

            attempts to vilify them, he will prove to be himself liable to <lb/>

            of Euripides: and that drama was never acted by either <lb/>
            Theodorus or Aristodemus, to whom the defendant used to <lb/>

            of the orators of that day, with his hand folded inside the <lb/>
            mantle ;2 this by way of reproach and rebuke to the forward­ <lb/>
            ness of Timarchus. But the Salaminians say the statue has <lb/>
            not been erected fifty years, and it is nearly two hundred and <lb/>
            forty years from Solon to the present time, so that the artist <lb/>
            who shaped that figure was not only himself no contemporary <lb/>
            of Solon, but his grandfather was not either. However, he <lb/>
            said this to the jury, and gave an imitation: but what was <lb/>
            of far greater advantage to the state than Solon'a attitude, <lb/>
            to see (namely) his heart and mind-of them he gave no <lb/>
            imitation, quite the contrary. Solon (after Salamis had <note type="footnote"> illustrious sons." Auger: " de merveilleux personnages." Pabst: diese <lb/>

            fragments only remain, and are remarkable for elegance and simplicity <lb/>
            rather than for any merit of a higher description. The story respecting <lb/>
            the recovery of Salamis is told in Plutarch's Life of Solon, as follow? <lb/>
            The Megarians had wrested the island of Salamis from the Athenians, <lb/>
            who, after many unsuccessful attempts to retrieve their loss, became <lb/>
            heartily sick of the war, and passed a decree making it punishable with </note> <lb/>

            revolted from the Athenians, and they had decreed to punish <lb/>
            with death whoever advised its recovery,) at the risk of his <lb/>
            own life composed and sang an elegy, and preserved that <lb/>
            country to Athens, and removed the disgrace which had fallen <lb/>
            upon her. Æschines, although the Persian king and all the <lb/>
            Greeks had acknowledged Amphipolis to be yours, gave up and <lb/>
            Sold it, and supported Philocrates who moved the resolution. <lb/>
            Worth his while (was it not?) to mention Solon! And not <lb/>
            only here acted he so, but on his arrival there he never <note type="footnote"> death for any one to advise its renewal. Solon, who was a native of Salamis, <lb/>
            was greatly discontented; and by-and-by, having observed that the youth <lb/>
            of Athens were beginning to change their minds but afraid to violate the <lb/>
            law, counterfeited insanity, and, keeping himself at home, composed an <lb/>
            elegy on the loss of the island. It contained a hundred verses, and. is <lb/>
            said to have been a poem of considerable merit. Having these verses <lb/>
            by heart, he suddenly ran into the market-place with a cap on his head, <lb/>
            --(the cap was a sign of sickness,)—and mounting the herald's platform, <lb/>
            sang them out in a loud voice to the people. His supposed madness and <lb/>
            the exciting character of the verses gave it the appearance of inspiration. <lb/>
            Pisistratus, then a young man, was among the hearers, and urged them <lb/>
            to obey the voice of Solon. In the moment of their enthusiasm the peo­ <lb/>
            ple repealed the decree, and prepared for war. Solon recovered Salamis <lb/>
            by a stratagem, which is variously related. According to oneaccount, <lb/>
            he by a false message enticed a large body of Megarians to the Attic <lb/>
            coast, and having put them to the sword, sailed instantly to Salamis <lb/>
            and took it. After some further struggles, the belligerent parties re­ <lb/>
            fetred their claims to the arbitration of Sparta. Solon pleaded his <lb/>
            country's cause before the arbitrators, and urged (among other arguments <lb/>
            in favour of the Athenian title to Salamis) that the Salaminians buried <lb/>
            their dead in the Athenian fashion, turning their faces to the west, and <lb/>
            not to the east, as the Megarians did; and also that they had separate <lb/>
            tombs for each body, whereas the Megarians put several bodies into one <lb/>
            tomb. He urged also that Salamis was called Ionian in some of the <lb/>
            Delphic oracles. A further story is told, that he inserted a line in the <lb/>
            catalogue of ships in the second book of the Iliad. which is now read </note> <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_79_fig8.jpg"/></figure><note type="footnote"> The second of these lines is said to have been Solon's interpolation, to <lb/>
              prove that Salamis was, even so early as the Trojan war, subject to, or at <lb/>
              least connected with Athens; and some critics have thought that the <lb/>
              spuriousness of the line appears from other passages of Homer, where the <lb/>
              Salaminians are made to occupy a station separate from the Athenians. <lb/>
              (See.Heyne's learned note to Iliad, II. 553.) The Megarians are said to <lb/>
              have contended for a different reading in Homer, which established <lb/>
              their own connexion with Salamis. Judgment was given by the arbi­ <lb/>

              a part of his speech to any one. The fact, I apprehend, <lb/>
              was-having received money, he could say nothing on the <lb/>
              other side of the question to Philip, who had paid him on <lb/>
              purpose that he might not restore Amphipolis. Here-take <lb/>
              and read these elegiacs of Solon, and let the jury see, that <lb/>

            THE ELEGIACS OF SOLON: <lb/>
            Our city everlastingly shall stand; <lb/>
            So Jupiter and all the Gods command: <lb/>
            Athenian Pallas lends her guardian aid, <lb/>
            She of the mighty Father, heavenly Maid. <lb/>
            Yet the fair city breedeth for her bane <lb/>
            A generation covetous and vain, - <lb/>
            Ill-minded statesmen, who shall yet be tried <lb/>
            In many sorrows to rebuke their pride; <lb/>
            Insatiable, in riot they devour <lb/>
            The fleeting pleasures of the festal hour, <lb/>
            Indulge their lustful appetence of gain, <lb/>
            And sparing neither sacred nor profane, <lb/>
            By spoil and rapine thrive, nor hold in awe <lb/>
            Omniscient Themis and her holy law, <lb/>
            Who sits in watchful silence, and the day <lb/>
            Of vengeance bides, more dreadful for delay. <lb/>
            Thus on a people creeps the dire disease, <lb/>
            Till perish all their ancient liberties: <lb/>
            Or civil strife or warfare is at hand, <lb/>
            To waste the youthful promise of the land. <lb/>
            A factious race the sword shall overthrow ; <lb/>
            Who wrong their friends are pillaged by the foe. <lb/>
             <pb n="197"/>
            Over the country these misfortunes brood : <lb/>
            The poor meanwhile, a hapless multitude, <lb/>
            Are dragg'd to foreign shores and long exile, <lb/>
            To slavery sold, and bound in fetters vile. <lb/>
            The common Pest of all comes home to each; <lb/>
            No door can guard him from the Fury's reach; <lb/>
            She leaps the lofty wall; hide where he will, <lb/>
            In cell or chamber, she shall find him still. <lb/>
            Fain am I thus, Athenians, to advise, <lb/>
            What evils under Anarchy arise, <lb/>
            How Discipline the public weal maintains, <lb/>
            Curbs wicked men with penance and with chains; <lb/>
            How she can tame the wild, the proud put low, <lb/>
            And wither mischief ere to strength it grow; <lb/>
            How straighten crooked justice, and assuage <lb/>
            The might of passion and unruly rage: <lb/>
            Under her sway confusion, discord cease, <lb/>
            And men abide in fellowship and peace.1 <note type="footnote">1 These are not from the Salamis, but verses of a purely political <lb/>
            character, addressed to the Athenians during some period of discord <lb/>
            and trouble. The future legislator, preparing the way for that great <lb/>
            work which has transmitted his name to all ages, endeavours to kindle <lb/>
            the flame of patriotism in his countrymen, rebukes the leading states­ <lb/>
            men for their selfishness and vicious conduct, and exhorts all classes to <lb/>
            maintain civil harmony and obedience to the laws. Whether this was <lb/>
            the whole poem, or is but an extract, we cannot determine. There are <lb/>
            errors in the text, and some verses manifestly lost. Pabst in his <lb/>
            version, which is in hexameter and pentameter, leaves the hiatuses as <lb/>
            he finds them. I have taken a different course, and have not kept so <lb/>
            close to the original as he. Francis has given a spirited version, which <lb/>
            I subjoin - <lb/>
            Nor Jove supreme, whose secret will is Fate, <lb/>
            Nor the blest Gods have doom'd th’ Athenian State; <lb/>
            For Pallas, with her Father's glories crown'd, <lb/>
            Spreads the protection of her Ægis round. <lb/>
            But dire Corruption wide extends its sway; <lb/>
            Athenians hear its dictates, and obey. <lb/>
            Oppressive demagogues our counsels guide, <lb/>
            Though various mischiefs wait to quell their pride. <lb/>
            Untaught with cheerful appetite to taste <lb/>
            The calm delights that crown the temperate feast, <lb/>
            A lust of gold their restless bosoms fires; <lb/>
            A lust of gold their guilty schemes inspires. <lb/>
            Vain are all laws, or human or divine, <lb/>
            To guard the public wealth, or sacred shrine, <lb/>
            While private life is fill'd with mutual fraud, <lb/>
            By Justice and her sacred laws unawed. <lb/>
            Silent she sits, the past, the present views, <lb/>

          <p>You hear, 0 Athenians, what Solon declares of such men, <lb/>
            and of the gods who (he says) protect the commonwealth. <lb/>
            For myself, I believe as I hope, that his statement is eternal <lb/>
            true; that the gods do indeed protect our commonwealth: <lb/>
            and in some sort I believe, that all which has taken place <lb/>
            upon this audit has been a manifestation to the common­ <lb/>
            wealth of divine benevolence. Only see :-A man who has <lb/>
            grossly violated his duty as ambassador, who has given up <lb/>
            places 'in which the gods had ought to be worshipped by you <lb/>

            longer To what end ? That he may obtain neither pity <lb/>
            nor pardon for his own offences. Further, in accusing that <lb/>

            And servile chains their freebom sons enslave; <lb/>
            Sedition rages; wars, long-slumbering, rise, <lb/>
            And the loved youth in prime of beauty dies; <lb/>
            For soon the foe lays waste that hapless state, <lb/>
            Where joyless Discord dwells, and foul Debate. <lb/>
            For the poor wretch a harder lot remains, <lb/>

            And find him in his chamber's dark recess. <lb/>
            Thus my good genius speaks, and bids advise <lb/>
            The sons of Athens to be just and wise; <lb/>
            To mark attentive what a stream of woes <lb/>
            From civil discord and contention flows; <lb/>
            What beauteous order shines, where Justice reigns, <lb/>

            know his villanies and have closely watched them all, I may <lb/>
            be received by you with the utmost indulgence. Further­ <lb/>
            more, by pushing off his trial during all the former period he <lb/>
            has been led on to a crisis, at which, out of regard to future <lb/>
            consequences, if to nothing else, it is neither safe nor possible <lb/>
            for you to let him escape punishment for his bribery.1 You <lb/>
            ought indeed, 0 Athenians, at all times to execrate and to <lb/>
            punish men guilty of corruption and treason; but now it will <lb/>
            be most especially seasonable and for the common benefit of <lb/>
            all mankind. For a plague, 0 Athenians, has fallen upon <lb/>
            Greece, a grievous and severe one, that requires some extraor­ <lb/>
            dinary good fortune and carefulness on your part. The <lb/>

            names: the rest of the people and the authorities (whatever <lb/>
            they are) in the several states, who ought to punish those <lb/>

          <p>This sort of thing, this kind of ambition, men of Athens, <lb/>
            until but the other day had destroyed the sovereignty and <lb/>
            national dignity of the Thessalians, and is at this moment <lb/>
            stealing away their liberty; for the citadels of some of them <lb/>
            are garrisoned by Macedonians. It has entered Peloponnesus, <lb/>
            and caused the massacres in Elis; and with such phrensy and <note type="footnote"> I The skill of the orator in this passage is worthy of observation. <lb/>
            There were three points greatly to the advantage of his opponent, as he <lb/>
            could not fail to see: first, the successful proceeding against Timarchus ; <lb/>
            secondly, the invidious character of the present prosecution, being <lb/>
            against a colleague with whom he had acted harmoniously in the be­ <lb/>
            ginning ; thirdly, the length of time which had elapsed since the com­ <lb/>
            mission of the supposed offence. Demosthenes, briefly adverting to <lb/>
            these points, turns them skilfully to his own account, without any labo­ <lb/>
            rieusargument, and without any appearance of doubt as to the effect <lb/>
            which they might produce on the minds of his hearers. He then <lb/>

            the baneful effects of subservience to Philip, (beginning <foreign xml:lang="grc">νόσημα γὰο, ὦ</foreign> <unclear/> <lb/>

            madness did it inspire those wretched people, that, to get <lb/>
            dominion over each other and gratify Philip, they would spill <lb/>
            the blood of their kindred and fellow-countrymen. And it <lb/>
            stops not even here. It entered into Arcadia, and has turned <lb/>
            everything there upside down; and now many of the Arca­ <lb/>
            dians, (who ought like yourselves to be eminently proud of <lb/>
            freedom, for the only indigenous people are you and they,) <lb/>
            hold Philip in admiration, and set him up in brass, and crown <lb/>
            him; and to complete all, should he visit Peloponnesus, they <lb/>
            have passed resolutions to receive him in their cities. The <lb/>
            Argives have done the same. By Ceres, if one must speak in <lb/>
            earnest, these matters require no little precaution; as the <lb/>
            plague, advancing in a circle, has entered, men of Athens, <lb/>
            even here. Whilst then you are yet in safety, be on your <lb/>

            duced it; or else, see that my words be not deemed to have <lb/>
            been wisely spoken, when you have no longer any resource.</p>
          <p>See you not, 0 men of Athens, how notable and striking an <lb/>
            example the poor Olynthians are; who owe their destruction, <lb/>
            unhappy men, to nothing so much as to conduct of this <lb/>
            kind? You may discover it plainly by what has befallen <lb/>
            them. When they had only four hundred horse, and were <lb/>

            although they possessed a thousand horse and were more <lb/>
            than ten thousand in number, and you sent to their assistance <lb/>
            ten thousand mercenaries and fifty galleys and four thousand <lb/>
            citizens besides, all of it could not save them; before a year <lb/>
            of the war had expired, the betrayers had lost all the cities in <lb/>
            Chalcidice; Philip could no longer be at the call of the <lb/>
            betrayers, and was puzzled what he should first take pos­ <lb/>
            session of. Five hundred horse, betrayed by their own leaders, <lb/>
            did Philip capture with all their arms, such a number as no <lb/>
            mortal ever did before. And the perpetrators of all this were <lb/>
            not ashamed to look at the sun, or at the earth (their <lb/>
            country) on which they stood, or at her temples or sepulchres, <lb/>
            or at the infamy that upon such doings was sure to follow. <lb/>
            So mad and senseless, 0 Athenians, are people rendered by <lb/>
            the taking of bribes ! You therefore, you the people, must be <lb/>
            wise, and not permit such practices, but punish them by <lb/>
            public sentence. It would indeed be monstrous, if, having <lb/>
            passed so many severe resolutions against the betrayers of <lb/>
            Olynthus, you should fail to punish criminals in your own <lb/>
            country. Read me the decree concerning the Olynthians.</p>

            the acceptance of bribes precedes such practices, and it is on <lb/>

            whomsoever you see accepting bribes, men of Athens, look <lb/>

            to the people of Athens and their allies, himself and all his <lb/>

            that he had taken gifts on his embassy, they fined him fifty <lb/>
            talents at his audit, and were near putting him to death. <lb/>
            Yet no man can say, that the commonwealth has ever made a <lb/>
            better peace either before or after: but it was not that they <lb/>
            looked at. For that they considered was owing to their own <lb/>
            valour and the reputation of the commonwealth; while the <lb/>
            taking or not taking of money depended on the disposition of <lb/>
            the ambassador; they expected therefore of any man who <lb/>
            entered on public duties, that he should show a disposition for <lb/>
            honesty and integrity. Your ancestors thus considered bribe- <lb/>

            never imagined even in a dream, have not spontaneously put <lb/>
            these men to death, but require an accuser, and hear on their <lb/>

            one or two, sentenced to death upon an embassy which has <lb/>

          <p>According to this decree, men of Athens, you condemned <lb/>
            to death those ambassadors, of whom one was Epicrates,1 a <note type="footnote"> 1 This (though Pabst thinks otherwise) must be the same Epicrates <lb/>
            referred to in Athenæus (vi. 229, 251), where it is said, that he received <lb/>
            divers presents from the Persian king, and paid him the coarsest flat­ <lb/>
            tery; and even ventured to say (partly in joke, no doubt) that there <lb/>
            ought to be an annual election, not of nine archons, but of nine am­ <lb/>
            bassadors to the king. The writer expresses his wonder that the <lb/>
            Athenians should not have brought him to trial; which seems not to <lb/>
            agree with this passage of Demosthenes; but he may have been igno­ <lb/>

            man (as I hear from my elders) of good character, who was <lb/>
            on many occasions serviceable to the state, one of those that <lb/>
            marched from Piraeus1 and restored the democracy, and gene­ <lb/>
            rally a friend to the people. However, none of these things <lb/>
            helped him; and justly: for one who undertakes to manage <lb/>
            such important concerns should not be honest by halves, nor <lb/>
            take advantage of your confidence to do greater mischief but <lb/>
            should never do you any wrong at all wilfully.</p>
          <p>Well: if these men have left undone any part of what <lb/>
            those have been sentenced to death for, kill me this very <lb/>
            moment. Just see. "Since those men," it says,2 "acted <lb/>
            contrary to their instructions on the embassy:" and this is <lb/>
            the first of the charges. And did not these act contrary to <lb/>
            their instructions ? Did not the decree say, "for the Athenians <lb/>
            and allies of the Athenians," and did not these men exclude <lb/>
            the Phocians expressly from the treaty? Did not the decree <lb/>
            order them to swear the magistrates in the states, and did <lb/>
            not they swear the persons whom Philip sent to them? Did <lb/>
            not the decree say, that they should nowhere meet, Philip <lb/>
            alone, and did not they incessantly hold private conferences <lb/>
            with him? “ And some of them were convicted of making <lb/>
            false reports in the council”—ay, and these men before the <lb/>
            people too, and by what evidence?—for this is the grand <lb/>
            point-By the facts themselves: for surely the very reverse <lb/>
            of what they reported has taken place. " And sending false <lb/>
            intelligence by letter," it says. So have these men. " And <lb/>
            calumniating the allies and taking bribes.”—Well ; instead of <lb/>
            calumniating, say, having completely ruined: and this surely <lb/>
            is far more dreadful than calumniating. With respect to <lb/>
            the having taken bribes, I can only say, if they denied it, <lb/>
            proof would have been necessary; since they confess it, they <lb/>
            should have been led off to punishment surely.3 <note type="footnote"> 1 When Thrasybulus and his band of exiles marched from Phyle, and <lb/>

            no good in a commonwealth which had not sinews to stretch <lb/>

            an old woman, or for his children or any one else, but con­ <lb/>
            sider this, that, should you abandon the laws and the consti­ <lb/>

            shall that unhappy man remain in infamy, because he saw the <lb/>
            defendant to be a criminal, and will you allow the defendant <lb/>
            to go unscathed ? For what reason ? If AEschines thought <lb/>
            fit to demand such heavy satisfaction from trespassers against <lb/>
            him and his party, what should you, sworn judges, demand <lb/>
            from such heinous trespassers against the state, of whom the <lb/>
            defendant is proved to be one ? Oh, but our young men will <lb/>

          <p>To convince you however, that he destroyed this. man <lb/>
            Timarchus, not (good heavens!) out of any desire to make <lb/>
            your children virtuous, (for they are virtuous already, 0 <lb/>
            Athenians: never may such misfortune befal the common­ <lb/>

            council, that whoever should be convicted of carrying arms <lb/>
            or naval implements to Philip should be punishable with <lb/>
            death. To prove this, let me ask—how long was Timarchus <lb/>
            a public speaker ? A considerable time. Well: during all <lb/>
            that time Æschines was in the city, and never took umbrage, <lb/>
            or thought it a shocking matter that such a person should <lb/>
            open his mouth, until he went to Macedonia and became <lb/>

            looked for by the people of Greece; now we go about in­ <lb/>
            quiring what the others have resolved, listening what news <lb/>
            there is of the Arcadians, what of the Amphictyons, where <lb/>
            Philip is about to march, whether he is alive or dead. Is it <lb/>
            not thus we employ ourselves ? I for my part am afraid, not <lb/>
            if Philip is alive, but if the abhorring and punishing of <lb/>
            criminals is dead in the commonwealth. Philip alarms me <lb/>
            not, if all is sound with you; but if you allow impunity to <lb/>
            men who are willing to be his hirelings, if certain of the <lb/>
            people in your confidence will plead for these men, and, after <lb/>
            denying all along that they are Philip's agents, will get up <lb/>
            for them now-this alarms me. How comes it, Eubulus, <note type="footnote"> 1 AEschines, in allusion to this passage, (De fals. Leg. 48,) speaks of <lb/>

              considerations :-There were persons in Elis who plundered <lb/>
              the public? Very probably. Well: were any of those per­ <lb/>
              sons concerned in overthrowing the democracy there lately? <lb/>
              Not one. Again: while Olynthus existed, there were persons <lb/>
              of the same kind ? I should think so. Did Olynthus fall <lb/>
              through them? No. At Megara, again, think ye not there <lb/>
              was a thief or two who pilfered the public monies? Un­ <lb/>
              doubtedly; and it has come to light. Which of them caused <lb/>
              the events which have occurred there ? Not one. What sort <lb/>
              of people then are they who commit these heavy crimes? <lb/>
              The men who deem themselves of importance enough to be <lb/>
              called friends and acquaintances of Philip,—men who covet <lb/>
              command and are invested with civic dignity, and who con­ <lb/>
              sider they ought to be greater than the common people. <lb/>
              Was not Perilaus tried lately at Megara.1 before the Three <note type="footnote"> <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἱερῶν χρημάτων</foreign>, and had the management of its revenues, or he may <lb/>

              penalty. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Philip's attempt on Megara, which appears to have been made in, <lb/>
              or just before, the year B.C.343, is thus described by Thirlwall, History <lb/>
              of Greece, vi. 15:— </note><note type="footnote"> “ It seems to have been while he was still occupied with the affairs of <lb/>
              Thessaly, or at least before he withdrewfrom the country, that he made <lb/>
              an attempt in another quarter, which, if it had succeeded, would have <lb/>
              brought him nearer by a great step to one of his principal objects. <lb/>
              Megara was at this time, as it had probably never ceased to be, divided <lb/>
              between rival factions, which however seem not to have been so turbulent <lb/>
              as to prevent it from enjoying a high degree of prosperity, and there <lb/>
              are indications that its form of government was not unhappily tempered. <lb/>
              The old animosity against Athens had perhaps now in a great measure <lb/>
              subsided: Philip indeed had his adherents; but there was a strong <lb/>
              party which opposed them, and which looked to Athens for protection. <lb/>
              The contending interests, however, seem not to have been exactly those <lb/>
              of democracy and aristocracy or oligarchy. Philip's leading partisans <lb/>
              appear to have been some of the most powerful citizens, who hoped with <lb/>

              dorus, a man for wealth, birth, and reputation the first of the <lb/>
              Megarians, come forward and beg him off, and again send <lb/>
              him out to Philip; and afterwards the one came with his <lb/>
              mercenary troops, whilst the other was cooking up 1 matters <lb/>
              in the city ? That is one example. There is nothing, nothing <lb/>
              in the world, more to be guarded against than allowing any <lb/>
              one to be exalted above the people. Don't let me have men <lb/>
              saved or destroyed at the pleasure of this or that individual; <lb/>
              but whoever is saved by his actions, or the contrary, let him <lb/>
              be entitled to the proper verdict at your hands. That is con­ <lb/>
              stitutional Besides, many men have on occasions become <lb/>
              powerful with you : Callistratus, again, Aristophon, Dio­ <lb/>
              phantus, others before them: but where did they each exer­ <lb/>
              cise their sway? In the popular assembly. In courts of <lb/>
              justice no man up to the present day has ever had an autho­ <lb/>
              rity greater than yourselves or the laws or your oaths. <lb/>
              Then don't suffer this man to have it now. To show you <lb/>
              that it will be more reasonable to take such precaution than <note type="footnote"> to hold under him. Ptœodorus, the foremost man in Megara, in birth, <lb/>
              wealth, and reputation, was, according to Demosthenes, at the head of <lb/>
              a conspiracy for the purpose of placing the city in Philip's hands, and <lb/>
              had opened a correspondence with him, in which he employed another <lb/>
              Megarian, Perilaus, as his agent. Perilaus was brought to trial for his <lb/>
              unauthorized dealings with a foreign court, but was acquitted through <lb/>
              the influence of Ptœodorus, who sent him again to obtain a body of <lb/>
              Macedonian troops, while he himself stayed to prepare for their reception <lb/>
              at Megara. The plot appears to have been baffled by some unusually <lb/>
              vigorous measures of the Athenians. It is difficult to determine, whether <lb/>
              an expedition which they made about this time to their frontier on the <lb/>
              side of Drymus and Panactus was connected with these movements <lb/>
              at Megara; and equally uncertain, though perhaps more probable, that <lb/>
              it was on this occasion Phocion was sent, at the request of their <lb/>
              Megarian partisans, to guard the city. Though he could not secure it <lb/>
              from treachery within, he took the most effectual precautions against <lb/>
              a surprise from without: he fortified Nicæa, and again annexed it to <lb/>
              the city by two long walls. However this may be, the attempt of <lb/>
              Ptœodorus failed, and Philip's hopes in this quarter were for the time <lb/>
              frustrated." . </note><note type="footnote"> 1 In the original the literal expression is, “cheese-making." The same <lb/>
              metaphor is used by Aristophanes, and very likely it was common. So <lb/>

              to put confidence in these men, I will read you an oracle of <lb/>
              the gods, who always protect the commonwealth far better <lb/>
              than her statesmen. Read the verses:</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The Oracle.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>You hear, 0 Athenians, what the gods admonish you. If <lb/>
            now they have given you this response during a time of war, <lb/>
            they mean that you should beware of your generals; for the <lb/>
            generals are conductors of war: but if after the conclusion <lb/>
            of peace, they mean your chief statesmen; for they have the <lb/>
            lead, their counsels you follow, by them are you in danger of <lb/>
            being deceived.</p>
          <p>And you are told by the oracle to hold the commonwealth <lb/>
            together, so that all may have one mind, and not cause grati­ <lb/>
            fication to the enemy. Think ye now, 0 Athenians, that the <lb/>
            preserving, or the punishing, of a man who has done all this <lb/>
            mischief would cause gratification to Philip? I think the <lb/>
            preserving. The oracle however says, you should do your <lb/>
            best to prevent the enemy rejoicing. So it exhorts all with <lb/>
            one mind to punish those who have in any way been subser­ <lb/>
            vient to the enemy: Jupiter, Dione, all the gods. They <lb/>
            that intend you evil are outside, their supporters are inside; <lb/>
            the business of the former is to give bribes, of the latter to <lb/>
            receive, and get off those who have received them.</p>
          <p>Besides, even by human reasoning one may see, that the <lb/>
            most mischievous and dangerous of all things is, to suffer <lb/>
            a leading statesman to become attached to those who have <lb/>
            not the same objects with the people. Consider by what <lb/>
            means Philip has become master of everything, and by what <lb/>
            means he has achieved the greatest of his works. By pur­ <lb/>
            chasing success from those who would sell it; by corrupting <lb/>
            and exciting the ambition of leading statesmen: by such <lb/>
            means. Both these however it is in your power, if you <lb/>
            please, to render ineffective to-day: if to one class of men <lb/>
            you will not listen, when they plead for people of this kind, <lb/>
            but show that they have no authority with you, (for now <lb/>
            they say they have authority:) and if you will punish him <lb/>
            that has sold himself, and this shall be seen by all.</p>
          <p>With any man you might well be wroth, 0 Athenians, who <lb/>
            had done such deeds, and sacrificed allies and friends and <lb/>
            opportunities, which make or mar the fortunes of every people, <note type="footnote"> p 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="212"/>
            but with none more strongly or more justly than the defen­ <lb/>
            dant. A man who took his place with the mistrusters of <lb/>
            Philip-who first and singly discovered him to be the com­ <lb/>
            mon enemy of all the Greeks, and then deserted and turned <lb/>
            traitor, and has suddenly become a supporter of Philip-can <lb/>
            it be doubted that such a man deserves a thousand deaths ? <lb/>
            The truth of these statements he himself will not be able to <lb/>
            gainsay. Who is it that brought Ischander to you in the <lb/>
            beginning, whom he represented to have come here from the <lb/>
            country's friends in Arcadia ? Who cried out, that Philip was <lb/>
            packing1 Greece and Peloponnesus, whilst you were sleeping? <lb/>
            Who was it that made those fine long orations before the <lb/>
            assembly, and read the decree of Miltiades and Themistocles, <lb/>
            and the young men's oath in the temple of Aglauros 12 Was <lb/>
            it not this man Who persuaded you to send embassies <lb/>
            almost to the Red Sea, urging that Greece was plotted against <lb/>
            by Philip, and that it became you to foresee it and not <lb/>
            abandon the interests of the Greeks ? Was not the mover of <lb/>
            the decree Eubulus, and the envoy to Peloponnesus the de­ <lb/>
            fendant Æschines ? What he may have talked and harangued <lb/>
            about when he got there, is best known to himself; but what <lb/>
            he reported to you I am sure you all remember. Several <lb/>
            times in his speech he called Philip a barbarian and a pest,3 <lb/>
            and told you the Arcadians were delighted that the Athenian <lb/>
            commonwealth was now attending to her affairs and rousing <lb/>
            herself. But what most of all had made him indignant, he <lb/>
            said,--coming home he met Atrestidas on his way from <lb/>
            Philip's court, and there were about thirty women and chil­ <lb/>
            dren walking with him; and he was astonished, and asked <lb/>

            of the state. But after he had gone to Macedonia, and be­ <lb/>
            held this Philip, the enemy of himself and the Greeks, was it <lb/>
            like or similar ? Very far from it. He said you were not to <lb/>
            remember your ancestors, not to talk of trophies or succour <lb/>
            any one; and he was surprised at the men who advised you <lb/>
            to consult with the Greeks about peace with Philip, as if any <lb/>
            one else had to be persuaded on a question that concerned <lb/>
            you alone; and that Philip himself was (0 Hercules!) a <lb/>
            thorough Greek,1 an eloquent speaker, a warm friend of <lb/>
            Athens, and that there were some men in the city so unrea­ <lb/>
            sonable and perverse, as not to be ashamed of abusing him <lb/>
            and calling him a barbarian.</p>
          <p>Is it possible that the same man, after having made the <lb/>
            former speeches, could have ventured to make these, without <lb/>
            having been corrupted? But further; is there a man who, <lb/>
            after having then execrated Atrestidas on account of the <lb/>
            women and children of the Olynthians, could have endured <lb/>
            now to cooperate with Philocrates, who brought free-born <lb/>
            Olynthian women hither for dishonour, and is so notorious <lb/>
            for his abominable life, that I have no need to say anything <lb/>
            scandalous or offensive about him, but let me only say that <lb/>
            Philocrates brought women, you and the bystanders know <lb/>
            all the rest, and feel pity, I am sure, for those poor unhappy <lb/>
            creatures, whom AEschines pitied not, nor wept for Greece <lb/>
            on their account, that among an allied people they should be <lb/>
            outraged by the ambassadors.</p>
          <p>But he will shed tears for himself, such an ambassador <note type="footnote"> 1 Auger: “ le meilleur ami des Grecs." And so Francis: “best <lb/>
            affected to Greece." But it rather has reference, I think, to the character <lb/>
            and manners of Philip, and perhaps also to his parentage. Shilleto: <lb/>

            as he has been: perhaps he will bring forward his children and <lb/>
            mount them up on the bar. But remember, ye men of the <lb/>
            jury-against his children-that you had many friends and <lb/>
            allies, whose children are wanderers, roaming about in beg­ <lb/>
            gary, having suffered cruel injuries through this man; who are <lb/>
            far more deserving of your compassion than the sons of such <lb/>
            a malefactor and traitor; and that these men, by adding to <lb/>
            the treaty the words " and to his posterity," have deprived <lb/>
            your children even of their hopes. Against his own tears <lb/>
            harden yourselves by reflecting, that you have in your power <lb/>
            a man who bade you send accusers into Arcadia against the <lb/>
            agents of Philip. Now then you need not send an embassy <lb/>
            to Peloponnesus, or go a long journey, or incur travelling <lb/>
            expenses, but only advance each of you up to the bar here, <lb/>
            and give your righteous and just verdict for your country <lb/>
            against a man, who, (0 heaven and earth!) after having de­ <lb/>
            claimed, as I told you in the outset, about Marathon, Salamis, <lb/>
            battles, and trophies, all of a sudden, when he had set foot <lb/>
            in Macedonia, used the very opposite language-that you <lb/>
            should not remember your ancestors, not talk of trophies, <lb/>
            not succour any one, not deliberate in conjunction with the <lb/>
            Greeks, but should almost dismantle your city-walls. Surely <lb/>
            more disgraceful language has never at any period of time <lb/>
            been spoken among you. For what Greek or barbarian is there <lb/>
            so stupid, so uninformed, so bitter an enemy of our state, who, <lb/>
            if the question were asked—“Tell me, of this present land <lb/>
            and country of Greece is there a part which would have had <lb/>
            the name, or been occupied by the Greeks who now possess <lb/>
            it, if the heroes of Marathon and Salamis, our ancestors, had <lb/>
            not enacted those feats of valour on their behalf?”—there is <lb/>
            not one, I am certain, who would not answer, " No; it must <lb/>
            all have been taken by the barbarians!" Persons that even <lb/>
            an enemy would not rob of their praise and honour, are you <lb/>
            their descendants, I say, forbidden to remember by Æschines, <lb/>
            for the sake of his own pelf? And observe, other advantages <lb/>
            are not shared in by the dead, but praise for glorious actions <lb/>
            is the peculiar property of those who have died in achieving <lb/>
            it; for then even envy opposes them no longer; and the <lb/>
            defendant, for depriving them of this, deserves now to be <lb/>
            deprived of his rank, and you will do well to inflict this <lb/>
            punishment upon him on behalf of your ancestors. But by <lb/>
             <pb n="215"/>
            such language, you miscreant, while of the deeds of our <lb/>
            ancestors you made spoil and havoc with your tongue, you <lb/>
            ruined all our affairs. And out of all this you are a land­ <lb/>
            owner and become a considerable personage. For here again : <lb/>
            Before he had wronged the state so grievously, he acknow­ <lb/>
            ledged that he had been a clerk and was under obligation to <lb/>
            you for electing him, and he behaved himself with decency; <lb/>
            but since he has wrought such infinite mischief, he has drawn <lb/>
            up his eyebrows, and if any one says, “the ex-clerk Æschines,” <lb/>
            he is at once his enemy, and says he has been slandered; and <lb/>
            he traverses the market with his robe down to his ankles, <lb/>
            walking as stately as Pythocles, puffing out his cheeks, one of <lb/>
            the friends and acquaintances of Philip for you,—that’s what <lb/>
            he is now,-one of those that would be rid of the people, and <lb/>
            regard the present establishment as a raging sea:1 he that <lb/>
            formerly worshipped the dining-hall !2</p>
          <p>Let me now recapitulate to you, in what manner Philip <lb/>
            outmanoeuvred you by getting these abominable men to assist <lb/>
            him. It is well worth your while to examine and look into <lb/>
            the whole artifice. At first when he wanted peace, his domi­ <lb/>
            nions being pillaged by corsairs, and his ports having been <lb/>
            closed so that he could enjoy none of their advantages, he sent <lb/>
            those men who made such friendly declarations in his name, <lb/>
            Neoptolemus, Aristodemus, Ctesiphon; but after we ambas­ <lb/>
            sadors had been with him, he engaged the defendant's services <lb/>
            directly, to second and support the beastly Philocrates, and to <lb/>
            overpower us whose intentions were honest; and he composed <lb/>
            a letter to you, through which he mainly expected to obtain <lb/>
            peace. Yet even this did not enable him to do anything im­ <lb/>
            portant against you without destroying the Phocians; and <lb/>
            that was not easy; for his affairs had been brought as it were <lb/>
            by accident to such a critical point, that either it was impos- <note type="footnote"> 1 Literally: " storm and madness." Francis: “confusion and mad­ <lb/>

            sible for him to accomplish any of his objects, or he must <lb/>
            commit falsehood and perjury, and have all men, Greeks and <lb/>
            barbarians, witnesses of his baseness. For should he accept <lb/>
            the Phocians as allies, and take the oaths to them in conjunc­ <lb/>
            tion with you, it became necessary at once to break his oaths <lb/>
            to the Thessalians and Thebans, the latter of whom he had <lb/>
            sworn to assist in subjugating Bœotia, the former in restoring <lb/>
            the Pylæan congress. Should he refuse to accept them, (as in <lb/>
            fact he did refuse,) he thought you would not suffer him to <lb/>
            pass, but would send forces to Thermopylae, as, but for being <lb/>
            over-reached, you would have done, and in that case he <lb/>
            reckoned it would be impossible to pass. This indeed there <lb/>
            was no need for him to be informed by others; he had his <lb/>
            own testimony to the fact: for the first time when he van­ <lb/>
            quished the Phocians, and overthrew their mercenary troops <lb/>
            and their chieftain and general Onomarchus, when no people <lb/>
            in the world, Greek or barbarian, succoured the Phocians but <lb/>
            you, so far from passing the strait or accomplishing any of <lb/>
            his objects by the passage, he could not even approach it. <lb/>
            He was certain therefore, I take it, that now when Thessaly <lb/>
            was quarrelling with him,—the Pheræans for example refused <lb/>
            to join his march,-when the Thebans were getting the worst <lb/>
            and had lost a battle, and a trophy had been erected over <lb/>
            them, it was impossible to pass, if you sent forces, or to <lb/>
            attempt it with impunity, unless he had recourse to some <lb/>
            artifice. " How then shall I escape open falsehood, and effect <lb/>
            all my objects without the imputation of perjury ? How? In <lb/>
            this way-if I can find some Athenian citizens to deceive <lb/>
            the Athenians; for that disgrace will not devolve upon me." <lb/>
            Therefore his ambassadors gave you notice, that Philip would <lb/>
            not accept the Phocians for allies; but these men explained <lb/>
            it to the people thus-that it was not proper for Philip openly <lb/>
            to accept the Phocians for allies, on account of the Thebans <lb/>
            and Thessalians; but if he got things into his hands and <lb/>
            obtained the peace, he would then do exactly what we should <lb/>
            now desire him to agree to. By such promises and lures he <lb/>
            obtained peace from you, excluding the Phocians; but he had <lb/>
            next to prevent your sending succour to Thermopylae, for the <lb/>
            chance of which even then your fifty galleys were lying at <lb/>
            anchor, so that, if Philip advanced, you might oppose him. <lb/>
            “Well? what contrivance shall I have again about this?” <lb/>
             <pb n="217"/>
            To deprive you of your opportunities, and bring matters sud­ <lb/>
            denly upon you,1 so that, even if you wished, you should not <lb/>
            be able to march from home. It was managed by these men <lb/>
            accordingly, it appears. I, as you have heard several times, <lb/>
            was unable to depart earlier, and though I hired a vessel, <lb/>
            I was prevented from setting sail. But it was necessary also <lb/>
            that the Phocians should put confidence in Philip, and volun­ <lb/>
            tarily surrender themselves, so that no delay might intervene, <lb/>
            and no hostile decree come from you. " Well then ; it shall <lb/>
            be reported by the Athenian ambassadors, that the Phocians <lb/>
            are to be saved, so that even those who mistrust me will <lb/>
            deliver themselves up, relying on the ambassadors : the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians themselves I will send for, that they, believing all <lb/>
            their objects to be secured, may pass no adverse vote; and <lb/>
            these men shall carry such reports and assurances from me, <lb/>
            that under no circumstances will they be induced to stir."</p>
          <p>In this manner and by such contrivances, through men <lb/>
            doomed themselves to destruction, was everything brought to <lb/>
            ruin; for immediately, instead of seeing Thespiæ and Platæa <lb/>
            reestablished, you heard that Orchomenus and Coronea were <lb/>
            enslaved; instead of Thebes being humbled and her pride <lb/>
            and insolence abated, the fortifications of your allies the <lb/>
            Phocians were being razed to the ground, the persons razing <lb/>
            them were the Thebans, who by Æschines in his speech had <lb/>
            been scattered into villages. Instead of Eubœa being given <lb/>
            to you as a compensation for Amphipolis, Philip is even esta­ <lb/>
            blishing places in Eubœa to attack you from, and is con­ <lb/>
            tinually forming designs upon Geræstus and Megara. Instead <note type="footnote"> 1 So it is well explained by Reiske in his Index, under <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐφιστάναι</foreign>,— <lb/>

            but generally to Philip and all his party—“that they should bring," <lb/>
            etc.; as Pabst has it: Man wird machen müssen, dass Ihr zum Handeln <lb/>
            keine Zeit mehr findet, und die Sache so leiten müssen, dass er plötzlich <lb/>
            Euch fiber den Hals kommt; in which version however the last clause <lb/>
            deviates a little from the original. Schaefer properly says the sentence <lb/>
            is resolvable into <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγαγεῖν ἄφνω τὰ πράγματα καὶ ἐπιστῆσαι</foreign>. Shilleto is <lb/>
            wrong in supposing that <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φίλιππον</foreign> could be understood after <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιστῆσαι</foreign>. <lb/>
            He translates the passage—“that they (the Athenian envoys) should <lb/>
            rob you of your times and opportunities of action, and all on a sudden <lb/>
            bring on affairs, and place Philip at their head." Francis had fallen <lb/>

            deprived of her preaudience at Delphi.2 The whole business <lb/>
            has been a sort of enigma to the state. Philip has been dis­ <lb/>

            war; and these men have their wages for it, and up to the <lb/>
            present day have not been brought to justice.</p>
          <p>That they have been bribed outright for all this, and have <lb/>
            received the price of it, has in many ways, I imagine, been <lb/>

            can hardly be a doubt, mentioned as it is in connexion with Oropus, <lb/>
            that it related to a quarrel between Thebes and Athens, and not, as <lb/>

            that the expedition was sent to resist some aggressions of the Thebans <lb/>

            Orat. de Halonneso, p. 46,)—who also believes that these forces were <lb/>
            sent to oppose the passage of Philip's troops to Megara,—conceive that <lb/>
            this Drymus lay on the confines, not of Attica and Boeotia, like Pan­ <lb/>
            actus, but of Phocis and Doris. Their only reason for this opinion <lb/>
            seems to be the accent. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δρύμος</foreign> is mentioned by Herodotus, viii. 33, as <lb/>
            a Phocian town on the Cephisus. Whether a town of that name existed <lb/>

            time in striving to make out a complete demonstration of <lb/>
            what you knew yourselves. However, do let me add one <lb/>
            thing more: Is there any of the ambassadors sent by Philip <lb/>
            to whom you, men of the jury, would erect a brazen statue iT <lb/>
            the market-place ? Nay: would you give dinner in the city- <lb/>
            hall, or any other of those rewards which you honour your <lb/>
            benefactors with ? I should think not. Why ? You are <lb/>
            certainly neither ungrateful nor unjust nor bad men. It is, <lb/>
            you would say, and with truth and justice, because they did <lb/>
            everything for Philip and not a thing for you. Think ye <lb/>
            then that your sentiments are such, and Philip's are different, <lb/>
            -that he confers upon these men presents of such number <lb/>
            and value, because on their embassy they acted well and <lb/>
            faithfully for you ? Impossible. You see how he received <lb/>
            Hegesippus and his co-ambassadors. I pass by the rest; but <lb/>
            he banished our poet Xenoclides for entertaining them, his <lb/>
            fellow-countrymen. Such is the way he behaves to those who <lb/>
            honestly speak their opinions on your behalf, while to those <lb/>
            who have sold themselves he behaves as he does to these men. <lb/>
            Are witnesses required for this? Are any stronger proofs <lb/>
            wanted for this ? Can any one get this away from you ?</p>
          <p>A person however came up to me just before the opening <lb/>
            of the court,1 and told me the strangest thing,2—that he was <lb/>
            prepared to accuse Chares,3 and expected, by taking that <lb/>
            course and talking in that style, to impose on you. Now <lb/>
            I will not strongly insist upon this fact, that Chares (howso­ <lb/>
            ever brought to trial) has been found to have acted faithfully <lb/>
            and loyally, as far as lay in his power, for your interests, <lb/>
            though he has incurred many failures through persons who <lb/>
            from corrupt motives ruin everything; but I will make a large <lb/>
            concession. Let me grant that the defendant will speak <lb/>
            nothing about him but the truth: even then, I say, it is a <lb/>
            perfect mockery for the defendant to accuse him; for I charge <lb/>
            not Æschines with any of the transactions in the war, (for <lb/>
            them the generals are accountable;) nor with the state's having <lb/>
            concluded peace: but thus far I acquit him entirely. What <note type="footnote"> 1 I have followed Schaefer's interpretation of <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρὸ τοῦ δικαστηρίου</foreign>. <lb/>

            then do I say, and from what do my charges take their rise? <lb/>
            From his speaking, when the state was concluding peace, on <lb/>
            the side of Philocrates, and not on theirs who moved for the <lb/>
            good of the country; and from his having taken bribes; <lb/>
            from his afterwards on the second embassy wasting the <lb/>
            times, and performing none of your instructions; from his <lb/>
            tricking the state, and, after giving us to expect that Philip <lb/>
            would do all we desired, having utterly ruined our affairs; <lb/>
            from his afterwards, when others warned you to beware of <lb/>
            a man who had done so many wrongs,1 appearing as that <lb/>
            man's advocate. These are my charges; keep these in re­ <lb/>
            membrance : for a just and equitable peace, and men who <lb/>
            had betrayed nothing and not afterwards told lies, I would <lb/>
            even have commended, and advised you to honour them with <lb/>
            a crown. But if any general has injured you, it has nothing <lb/>
            to do with the present inquiry. For what general has lost <lb/>
            Halus, or who has destroyed the Phocians ? who Doriscus? <lb/>
            who Cersobleptes ? who the Sacred Mountain? who Ther­ <lb/>
            mopylæ? who has given to Philip a road all the way to <lb/>
            Attica through the territory of friends and allies ? who has <lb/>
            alienated Coronea, Orchomenus, Euboea ? who nearly Megara <lb/>
            lately ? who has made the Thebans powerful ? Of all these <lb/>
            important matters none was lost through the generals; none <lb/>
            has Philip had yielded to him at the peace with your consent: <lb/>
            they have been lost through these men and their venality. If <lb/>
            therefore he shirks these points, if, to lead you astray, he will <lb/>
            talk of anything sooner than them: meet him as I suggest <lb/>
            —" We are not sitting in judgment upon a general; you axe <lb/>
            not tried upon those charges. Don't tell us who else has caused <lb/>
            the destruction of the Phocians, but show that you are not <lb/>
            the cause. Why, if Demosthenes did any wrong, do you <lb/>
            mention it now, but did not accuse him when he rendered <lb/>
            his account? For this very reason you have deserved to <lb/>
            perish. Don't tell us that peace is a fine thing or an advan­ <lb/>
            tageous thing, for no one charges you with the state's having <lb/>
            concluded peace; but that the peace is not a shameful and <lb/>
            ignominious one-that we have not been cheated in many <lb/>
            ways and all was not lost after it-this you may tell us. <note type="footnote"> I Philip; in whose favour Æschines spoke when the Macedonian <lb/>
            ambassadors came to Athens, and required the Athenians to acknow­ <lb/>
            ledge his title as member of the Amphictyonic Council. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="221"/>
            For all these consequences are proved to have been brought <lb/>
            upon us by you; and how is it that up to this very day you <lb/>
            praise the author of such things ?" If you keep watch upon <lb/>
            him thus, he will have nothing to say, but will raise his <lb/>
            voice here and have exercised himself in spouting all to no <lb/>
            purposed</p>
          <p>About his voice too it may be necessary to say something; <lb/>
            for I hear that upon this also he very confidently relies, as if <lb/>
            he can overpower you by his acting. I think however, you <lb/>
            would be committing a gross absurdity, if, when he played <lb/>
            the miseries of Thyestes and the men at Troy, you drove and <lb/>
            hissed him off the boards, and nearly stoned him to death, so <lb/>
            that at last he desisted from his playing of third-rate parts, <lb/>
            yet now that, not upon the stage, but in public and most <lb/>
            important affairs of state, he has wrought infinity of evil, <lb/>
            you should pay regard to him as a fine speaker. Heaven <lb/>
            forbid ! Do not you be guilty of any folly, but consider : if <lb/>
            you are making trial of a herald, you should see that he has <lb/>
            a good voice, but if of an ambassador and undertaker of public <lb/>
            duties, that he is honest, that he demeans himself with spirit <lb/>
            as your representative, like a fellow-citizen towards you;2 as <lb/>
            I (for example) had no respect for Philip, but respected the <lb/>
            prisoners, delivered them, and never flinched; whereas the <lb/>
            defendant crouched before him, and sang the pæans, but you <lb/>
            he disregarded. Further, when you see eloquence or a fine <lb/>
            voice or any other such accomplishment in a man of probity <lb/>
            and honourable ambition, you should all rejoice at it and <lb/>
            encourage its display; for it is a common advantage to you <lb/>
            all: but when you see the like in a corrupt and base man, <lb/>
            who yields to every temptation of gain, you should discourage <lb/>
            and hear him with enmity and aversion; as knavery, getting <lb/>
            from you the reputation of power, is an engine against the <lb/>
            state. You see what mighty troubles have fallen upon the <lb/>
            state from what the defendant has got renown by. And <note type="footnote"> 1 Auger, not badly: " Inutilement alors fera-t-il éclater cette belle <lb/>

            then to this man as to a venal knave, who will not speak <lb/>
            a syllable of truth.</p>
          <p>Observe now, that not only in other respects, but in relation <lb/>
            to your dealings with Philip, it is in every way expedient for <lb/>
            the defendant to be convicted. For, on the one hand, should <lb/>
            he ever arrive at the necessity of doing justice to Athens, he <lb/>
            will alter his plan ;-now he has determined to cheat the <lb/>
            many and court the few; but if he hear that these men are <lb/>
            destroyed, he will choose hereafter to serve you the many <lb/>
            and masters of all. On the other hand, should he continue <lb/>
            in the same position of power and pride, the persons who are <lb/>
            ready to do anything for him you will have removed from <lb/>
            the country, if you remove these. How think ye?—men <lb/>

            a worse member of the commonwealth, seeing that those who <lb/>
            have sold your interests obtain riches, credit, a capital in <lb/>
            Philip's friendship, while those who behave themselves like <lb/>
            honest men and have spent money of their own get annoy­ <lb/>
            ance, enmity, ill-will from a certain class of people ? Never <lb/>
            let it come to this! Neither for your honour, nor for your <lb/>
            religion, nor for your safety, nor in any other point of view, is <lb/>
            it desirable to acquit the defendant. You must avenge your­ <lb/>
            selves, and make him an example to all, both to your fellow- <lb/>

          <p>JUSTIN commences the chapter, in which the subject of this war is <lb/>
            introduced, with the following passage :1</p>
          <p>" Græciæ civitates, dum imperare singulæ cupiunt, imperium <lb/>
            omnes perdiderunt." And he attributes the destruction of Greek <lb/>
            liberty to the ambition of the Thebans, and the impolitic measures <lb/>
            which they took to secure their own predominance. It was indeed <lb/>
            the weakness to which they had been reduced by. the long con­ <lb/>
            tinuance of a war provoked by themselves, together with the distrac­ <lb/>
            tions of Thessaly, and the necessity which there seemed to be for <lb/>
            some controlling power, which caused Philip of Macedon to be put <lb/>
            at the head of the Amphictyonic League, gave him a victorious <lb/>
            inroad into southern Greece, and made him the arbiter of her <lb/>
            destinies.</p>
          <p>Phocis,2 the principal seat of this war, is a country bounded on the <lb/>
            east by Bœotia, on the south by the Corinthian bay, on the west by <lb/>
            the Ozolian Locrians and a part of AEtolia. To the north-west is <lb/>
            the little triangular district called Doris, anciently occupied by the <lb/>
            Dryopes, but wrested from them by the more warlike tribe of <lb/>
            Dorians, who afterwards became so powerful a part of the Hellenic <lb/>
            body, and issued from this very district to effect the conquest of <lb/>
            Peloponnesus. North and north-east are the Epicnemidian Locrians <lb/>
            and the Opuntian Locrians. The rugged ridges of Mount Œta <lb/>
            stretch across the northern frontiers of Doris, Phocis, and Epic­ <lb/>
            nemidian Locris, and separate them from Thessaly. This chain of <lb/>
            mountains, forming the principal barrier of southern Greece, is termi­ <lb/>
            nated by the sea at the extremity of the Malian bay. Here was <lb/>
            the pass of Thermopylae, which extended more than a mile in <lb/>
            length between the cliffs of Œta3 and a marshy tract close to the <lb/>
            shore of the bay, and opened by a narrow pass into the territory of <note type="footnote"> (1) Lib. viii. c. 1. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) The ninth book of Strabo, chapter 3, contains a description of Phocis. The <lb/>

            Epicnemidian Locris. In early times it belonged to the Phocians, <lb/>
            who carried a wall across the western end of the pass, to check the <lb/>
            incursions of the Thessalians. The Phocian territory then extended <lb/>
            as far as the Eubœan strait, and there was a Phocian town on the <lb/>
            coast called Daphnus. A Locrian tribe afterwards got possession of <lb/>
            this district as far as the sea-coast, and Phocis was separated from <lb/>
            them by the mountains of Cnemis, from which that tribe took <lb/>
            its name.1</p>
          <p>The river Cephissus, rising in the Dorian hills near the town <lb/>
            of Lilæa, flows through the northern part of Phocis, and empties <lb/>
            itself into the Copaic Lake in Bœotia.2 On a slight eminence <lb/>
            between the valley of this river and Mount Cnemis stood Elatea, the <lb/>
            second city of Phocis; and some miles eastward a road by the <lb/>
            mountains led to the city of Abæ, where there was an ancient <lb/>
            oracular temple of Apollo destroyed by Xerxes, the ruins of which <lb/>
            were long preserved by the Greeks as a memorial.3</p>
          <p>The far-lamed mountain of Parnassus rises a little above the centre <lb/>
            of Phocis, its highest summit being nearly 8,000 feet above the level <lb/>
            of the sea. On a slope of the mountain, about seven or eight miles <lb/>
            below the summit, and itself 2,000 feet above the level of the sea, <lb/>
            stood the ancient Pytbo, afterwards Delphi, the capital city of <lb/>
            Phocis, and seat of the famous oracle of Apollo. Homer calls it <lb/>
            the rocky Pytho.' Seven miles and a half to the south, at the <lb/>
            head of the Crissæan bay, was Cirrha, anciently called Crissa. A <lb/>
            mountain called Cirphis overhung the town, and the river Pliatus, <lb/>
            rising in the Parnassian hills, flowed through it into the bay. This <lb/>
            afterwards, as we shall see, became the port of Delphi.5</p>
          <p>Under the eastern declivity of Parnassus, two or three miles from <lb/>
            the Bœotian frontier, was Daulis, whose people are said by Pausa­ <lb/>
            nias to have been the most warlike of the Phocians.6 The town of <lb/>
            Anticyra stood at the head of a gulf bearing the same name, to the <lb/>
            east of the Crissæan gulf, and is said to have been the same town <lb/>
            which Homer in the catalogue of warriors calls Cyparissus.7</p>

            a Locrian town, but was at length destroyed. There was an ancient monument here <lb/>

            of Thebes and Athens against Philip.1</p>
          <p>Altogether Phocis comprised from twenty to thirty small cities or <lb/>
            communities, which were federally united. A general congress was <lb/>
            held at a place on the road from Daulis to Delphi, where there was <lb/>
            a large national building called Phocicum, to which deputies were <lb/>
            sent by each of the communities2 Delphi however, not with standing <lb/>
            its local position, had from an early period separated itself from the <lb/>
            Phocian confederacy, and the inhabitants did not even like to be <lb/>
            called Phocians.3 The government was in the hands of a few noble <lb/>
            families, who traced their descent from Deucalion, and from whom <lb/>
            were chosen a council of five, to manage the affairs of the temple. <lb/>
            The members of this council held their offices for life, and were <lb/>
            called " The Sacred ones."4</p>
          <p>The Delphian oracle was the most celebrated of all in the Grecian <lb/>
            world, and held from the earliest times in the highest veneration. It <lb/>
            was consulted on the most important occasions, both for political pur­ <lb/>
            poses, as on questions of war and peace, the establishment of laws, <lb/>
            the institution of religious ceremonies, the founding of colonies, and <lb/>
            the like, and also for advice in the concerns of private life.6 Its <lb/>
            origin is necessarily obscure. It is said that a vapour, issuing from <lb/>
            the well of Cassotis, intoxicated those that approached it, and threw <lb/>
            them into delirium. The discovery was made by some shepherds, <note type="footnote"> (1) Pausanias, x. 33, &amp;c.</note> <note type="footnote">(2) Pausaniaa, x. 5, 1. </note><note type="footnote"> (3) Pausanias, iv. 34, 11. Thirlwall thinks that the Delphians were of Dorian <lb/>
            extraction, and that this may account for their generally favouring the cause of the <lb/>
            Spartans and their Dorian allies. (History of Greece, i. 377.) It is probable enough <lb/>
            that as Delphi, from a mere village, grew by degrees into a large and flourishing city, <lb/>
            enriched and embellished by the tribute of visitors from all parts, the Delphians chose <lb/>
            to consider it as belonging to the whole Hellenic nation, rather than to any local <lb/>

              commands the Lacedaemonians to remove the sepulchre of Pausanias, and erect <lb/>
              statues to him in the temple of Pallas. (Thucydides, i. 134.) Many examples occur <lb/>
              of private men consulting the god. To consult him however for a wicked purpose <lb/>
              was a dangerous experiment. The general-belief on that subject is illustrated by the <lb/>
              story of the Spartan Glaucus, who inquired whether it would be safe to refuse resto-</note> <note type="footnote"> VOL II. </note> <note type="footnote"> Q </note> <lb/>

              whose flocks straying near the spot had been seized with convulsions. <lb/>
              It was then found that human beings were similarly affected, and <lb/>
              that, while the fit was on them, they received a miraculous power of <lb/>
              prophetic vision and speech. This led to the idea of securing the <lb/>
              benefit of the divine agency, which produced such miraculous <lb/>
              effects, by establishing a permanent oracle on the spot. A temple <lb/>
              was built accordingly: the chasm from which the vapour ascended <lb/>
              was exactly in the centre: a tripod was placed over it; on this sat <lb/>
              the priestess and inhaled the sacred smoke, under whose influence <lb/>
              she poured forth the supernatural sounds inspired by Apollo.,</p>
          <p>The priestess, or Pythia, as she was called, was a native of Delphi, <lb/>
            and chosen from a humble family. She was anciently a girl; but <lb/>
            one having been seduced by a young Thessalian, it was determined <lb/>
            by the Delphians that, for the future, no priestess should be ap­ <lb/>
            pointed under the age of fifty, though she was always to be dressed <lb/>
            in the garb of a maiden. As the importance of the oracle increased, <lb/>
            it became necessary to appoint two and even three women to perform <lb/>
            the prophetic functions. For these they were duly prepared by a three <lb/>
            days' fast, by bathing in the holy spring of Castaly, and other religious <lb/>
            rites. The due observance of such rites was seen to by the Delphian <lb/>
            managers, to whom the business of the oracle was confided. It <lb/>
            has been supposed, that the priestess frequently acted under <lb/>
            their dictation in delivering the responses; and in later times, <lb/>
            when powerful states made a tool of the oracle, this was very <lb/>
            frequently the case; but to suppose that it was an ordinary <lb/>
            occurrence in the early times, would be inconsistent with the <lb/>
            received traditions of history, as well as with probability. In <lb/>
            the great multitude of instances in which the God was consulted, <lb/>
            the Delphians had no interest in practising deception; while they had <lb/>
            an interest, which in the early ages must generally have been para-­ <lb/>
            mount to all other motives, in maintaining the reputation of the <lb/>
            oracle for truth and wisdom. The priestess was usually, from either <lb/>
            physical or mental causes, or both, excited to a species of phrensy; <lb/>
            and sometimes even died in convulsions after her prophetic labours. <lb/>
            We can hardly believe that her madness was habitually feigned, and <note type="footnote"> ration of a deposit, and was punished by extirpation of his race. Herodotus, vi. 86. <lb/>

          <p>Certain days in every month were appointed for consulting the <lb/>
            oracle, to which people came from every state of Greece. The Del­ <lb/>
            phians regulated the order of consultation, which was generally <lb/>
            determined by lot; but sometimes, as a mark of honour or favour, <lb/>
            they granted precedency to particular states, as for example, to Crœsus, <lb/>
            to Sparta, to Athens, and afterwards to Philip of Macedon. Some­ <lb/>
            times also they granted exemption from payment of the usual fees.2</p>
          <p>Delphi stood pretty nearly in the centre of Greece, a position <lb/>
            highly favourable for the oracle.3 The temple was built on rising <lb/>
            ground in the highest part of the city, the front (attei its reconstruction, <lb/>
            B.c. 548) being of Parian marble. The sacred precinct was adorned <lb/>
            with a multitude of beautiful statues and sculptures, piesented by the <lb/>
            different states of Greece.4 Gifts of all kinds, ingots of gold and <lb/>
            silver, vases, bowls, statues, shields, and other ornaments, were sent <lb/>
            by kings and people, as well as by private individuals, from Greece, <lb/>
            Italy, Sicily, Sardinia, the Ægæan isles, and Asia Minor; particular <lb/>
            cells or compartments being appropriated for their reception.5 Even <lb/>
            in Homer's time Delphi was celebrated for its richest <note type="footnote"> (1) Plutarch, de Defectu Oracul. 51. The general respect in which the Delphian <lb/>
            oracle was held by the Grecian world inclines one to believe in some superhuman <lb/>
            agency, whether of a divine or of an evil spirit. Many of the responses were (no doubt) <lb/>
            expressed with designed ambiguity; but the well attested truthfulness of others <lb/>
            cannot be set down to chance. Strabo agrees with Herodotus as to the character <lb/>
            of the oracle. He calls it <foreign xml:lang="grc">α᾽ψευδέστατον τῶν πάντων</foreign>, (ix. 419, 422.) Cicero in his <lb/>
            first book de Divinatione (c. 19) urges in favour of the oracle, that it never could <lb/>
            have been so celebrated but for its veracity. Admitting its decline in later times, he <lb/>
            says : “Ut igitur nunc minori gloriâ est, quia minus oraculorum veritas excellit, sic <lb/>
            tum, nisi summâ veritate, in tantâ gloriâ non fuisset." He suggests as a possible <lb/>
            cause of its decline, that the inspiring vapour may have disappeared : “Potest via <lb/>
            illa terræ, quæ mentern Pythiæ divino afflatu concitabat, evanuisse vetustate, ut <lb/>
            quosdam exaruisse amnes aut in alium cursum contortos et dellexos videmus.” The <lb/>
            decline of the oracle after the Christian era, which Milton has so beautifully touched <lb/>
            upon in his Christmas hymn, favours the notion of demoniacal agency. Lucan <lb/>
            expresses the feelings of the most pious heathens, when he says :— <lb/>

          <p>These were continually augmented till the period of the second <lb/>
            Persian invasion, when Xerxes, having received accurate intelligence <lb/>
            of the accumulated treasures, marched to Delphi for the express <lb/>
            purpose of pillage.1 After his defeat Apollo shared with the other <lb/>
            gods in the spoil of the invader.2</p>
          <p>The importance of Delphi was yet further increased by the insti­ <lb/>
            tution of the Pythian games, and by its having been at a still earlier <lb/>
            period chosen as one of the seats of the Amphictyonic council. The <lb/>
            nature and functions of this council are so intimately connected with <lb/>
            the subject before us, that I must stop to explain them.</p>
          <p>It is related by ancient historians, that Ampbictyon, the son <lb/>
            of Deucalion, founded the institution which bears his name, and the <lb/>
            importance of which was in course of time so greatly enlarged as to <lb/>
            have been called a general council or diet of all Greece.3 Modern <lb/>
            writers consider Amphictyon to be a fictitious personage, invented by <lb/>
            mythologists, and deriving his name from the very council which he <lb/>
            is supposed to have founded, and which really signifies (according to <lb/>
            the etymology of the word)4 an association of neighbouring people <lb/>
            for some common purpose, whether of mutual defence, intercourse, <lb/>
            or sacrifice. The habits of the ancient Greeks inclined them to form <lb/>
            associations of this kind, especially those of a religious character; <lb/>
            and that many such existed, and were called Amphictyones, we are <lb/>
            distinctly informed; for example, one in the island Calauria, one at <lb/>
            Onchestus in Bœotia, and the more celebrated one of Delos. But that <lb/>
            which held its meetings at Delphi and Thermopylae acquired so much <lb/>
            greater a celebrity than all the rest, as to be specially called the Am­ <lb/>
            phictyonic assembly.'</p>
          <p>Twelve different people or tribes united to form this association; <lb/>
            Bœotians, Dorians, Ionians, Thessalians, Perrhaebians, Magnetos, <lb/>
            Œtæans, Phthiots, Malians, Locrians, Phocians, Dolopians.6 Such, <lb/>
            gathered from the somewhat varying accounts of different authors, is <lb/>
            considered to be the most probable enumeration of its members. <lb/>
            They met twice a year; in the spring at Delphi, in the autumn at the <lb/>
            temple of Ceres in Thermopylæ, near to the town of Anthela. Each <lb/>
            tribe sent deputies to the congress, called Pylagoræ and Hieromne- <note type="footnote"> (1) Herodotus, vii. 35. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) Herodotus, viii. 121; ix. 81. Delphi, like other temples, was greatly enriched <lb/>
            by the spoils of war, as appears from a multitude of cases mentioned by ancient <lb/>
            authors. Compare Herodotus, vii. 132, viii. 27. Thucydides, ii. 84; IT. 134. <lb/>
            Xenophon, .Hellen. iii. c. 3, s. 1. Modems, xii. 29; xiv. 93, where it is mentioned <lb/>

            mones. The former attended and spoke in the debates, and voted for <lb/>
            their respective tribes, each of whom had two votes. The latter were <lb/>
            persons of a sacerdotal character, whose functions were principally ex­ <lb/>
            ecutive, and related to the sacrifices and religious observances, though <lb/>
            they seem also to have attended the debates and assisted the Pyla­ <lb/>
            goræ, but without the right of voting. From Athens there were <lb/>
            sent three Pylagoræ, annually elected by the people, and one Hiero­ <lb/>
            mnemon, chosen by lot.1 It appears both from AEschines and Demos­ <lb/>
            tbenes, that, besides the ordinary congress of deputies, which sat in <lb/>
            the temple or sacred building, there was occasionally convened a sort <lb/>
            of popular Amphictyonic assembly, composed not only of the Pylagoræ <lb/>
            and Hieromnemons, but also of the inhabitants of the place, and such <lb/>
            strangers as had come to worship or consult the Deity.2</p>
          <p>The list of tribes indicates that it was anciently a local rather than <lb/>
            a national confederacy. Peloponnesus was altogether excluded; for <lb/>
            the Dorians, at the institution of the council, were simply the Dorians <lb/>
            under Mount Œta, not the conquering race who at a later period <lb/>
            comprised the most warlike states of Greece. These states after­ <lb/>
            wards became Amphictyonic, by virtue of their Dorian origin, as <lb/>
            Athens did by virtue of its Ionic. Arcadia, Elis, and Achaia, how­ <lb/>
            ever, at no time belonged to the confederacy; neither did Ætolia, <lb/>
            or Acarnania.</p>
          <p>Another thing to be remarked is the preponderance of Greeks <lb/>
            north of Thermopylae, and the power thereby given to the Thessalians; <lb/>
            a circumstance which became of great moment in the struggle with <lb/>
            Philip of Macedon. Thessaly,3 in its widest sense, included the <lb/>
            whole district bounded on the north by Olympus and the Cambunian <lb/>
            range of mountains, on the east by the Ægæan sea, on the south and <lb/>
            west by Mounts (Eta and Pindus. Thus considered, it comprehends <lb/>
            half of the Amphictyonic tribes; but the Thessalians, strictly so <lb/>
            called, occupied only a portion of this district, the remainder being <lb/>
            held by other races, more or less subject or subordinate to them. The <lb/>
            Perrhæbians dwelt between the river Peneus and Mount Olympus. <lb/>
            The Magnetes on the coast of the Ægæan, under Mounts Ossa <lb/>
            and Pelion: their country was called Magnesia. The Achæan <lb/>
            Phthiots occupied the plain beneath Mount Othrys, stretching from <note type="footnote"> (1) Aristophanes, Nubes, 624. The office of Hieromnemon was deemed a very honour­ <lb/>

            thence in a south-easterly direction as far as the Pagasæan bay, <lb/>
            upon which was the town of Halus. The Malians were between <lb/>
            Phthiotis and Thermopylae, giving name to the Malian bay; in their <lb/>
            country were the cities of Anticyra and Trachis; and afterwards <lb/>
            Heraclea was founded by the Lacedæmonians.1 West of the Malians <lb/>
            were the Œtæans, occupying the northern slopes of Mount Œta: they <lb/>
            included the Ænianes, whom Pausanias enumerates as one of the <lb/>
            Amphictyonic people. Dolopia was to the north-east of Mount <lb/>
            Othrys, and stretched beyond Pindus as far as the river Achelous.</p>
          <p>The people strictly called Thessali inhabited chiefly the central <lb/>
            plain between mounts Pindus, Olympus, Ossa, Pelion, and Othrys. <lb/>
            Their chief cities were Larissa, Pharsalus, Crannon, and Pheræ. <lb/>
            Originally they came from Thesprotia in Epirus, and after subduing <lb/>
            a Pelasgic or Æolian race, whom they found in occupation, they <lb/>
            established themselves in their new country as a sort of dominant <lb/>
            aristocracy. The conquered people were reduced to the condition of <lb/>
            serfs, and were called Penestæ;2 being bound to cultivate the land, <lb/>
            and follow their masters to battle when required. The Thessalians <lb/>
            gradually extended their power over the circumjacent tribes; and, <lb/>
            could they have been united and under a firm government, would <lb/>
            have become formidable to the southern states of Greece: but they <lb/>
            had no organized system of government, and the feuds between the <lb/>
            great families prevented any union taking place, except on particular <lb/>
            occasions, and for short periods. The ancient quadruple division of <lb/>
            Thessaly, which Philip revived for his own purposes, was probably <lb/>
            established at a time when the Thessalians had arrived at a consider­ <lb/>
            able height of power. The four districts were called Thessaliotis, <lb/>
            Histiæotis, Pelasgiotis, and Phthiotis; of which the first comprised <lb/>
            the central plain, the second the territory of the Perrhæbians and <lb/>
            the north-western parts, the third the eastern coast, and the fourth <lb/>
            the country of the Achæan Phthiots already described.3</p>
          <p>Another thing to be noticed is, that Amphictyonic membership <lb/>
            belonged not to cities, but to tribes or races, each of whom had the <lb/>
            same number of votes, however great, or however small; so that, <lb/>
            after the great expansion of the Ionic and Doric races, the right of <lb/>
            representation in the Amphictyonic congress was shared by Athens <lb/>
            and Sparta with the numerous communities which had sprung out <lb/>
            of those races respectively. It is supposed that the different cities <lb/>
            of one tribe took their turns of sending representatives, according to <lb/>
            some arrangement of which we have no particular information. It <note type="footnote"> (1) Thucydides, ii. 92. They hoped that it would give them the command of Ther­ <lb/>

            is probable that a leading and powerful state would gradually assume <lb/>
            to itself the rights of the whole tribe; yet still its constitutional <lb/>
            power in the congress would be limited to the original number of <lb/>
            votes; and Athens or Sparta could only acquire a preponderating <lb/>
            weight among the Amphictyons through the influence which they <lb/>
            exerted over the other constituent tribes. To such influence is <lb/>
            partly to be ascribed the increasing importance of the Amphictyonic <lb/>
            body, and its growth from a mere local association into the semblance <lb/>
            of an Hellenic diet. The sanctity of the Delphian temple gave an <lb/>
            additional lustre to its meetings.1</p>
          <p>The oath anciently taken by the members of the league was to <lb/>
            the following effect :-" That they would not destroy any city of <lb/>
            the Amphictyonic tribes; that they would not cut off their springs <lb/>
            of water either in peace or war; that they would turn their arms <lb/>
            against any people who did such things, and destroy their cities; <lb/>
            that, if any one committed sacrilege against the god, or formed, or <lb/>
            was privy to, any design to injure the temple, they would exert <lb/>
            themselves with hand, foot, tongue, and all their might, to punish <lb/>
            him.”2</p>
          <p>History furnishes us with a few examples in which the Amphic­ <lb/>
            tyons at an early period interposed in the affairs of Greece, to vindi­ <lb/>
            cate national rights or public justice, or to maintain the honour of <lb/>
            Apollo. Thus, when the conductors of a procession to Delphi were <lb/>
            insulted by some Megarians, the Amphictyons passed sentence on <lb/>
            the offenders.3 When the Dolopians of Scyrus, who had long been <lb/>
            addicted to piracy, seized and imprisoned some Thessalian merchants <lb/>
            who put into their port, and the merchants escaping preferred their <lb/>
            complaint to the Amphictyons, they condemned the islanders to pay <lb/>
            a fine. The guilty people, rather than pay the fine, chose to surrender <lb/>
            the island to Cimon, who took advantage of the occasion to annex it <lb/>
            to the dominion of Athens.4 At the close of the Persian war, the <lb/>
            Amphictyons offered a reward for Ephialtes who betrayed the pass <lb/>
            over the mountains to Xerxes. They erected a monument to <lb/>
            Leonidas.6 After the burning of the Delphian temple, B.C. 548, we <lb/>
            find them entrusted with the task of rebuilding it, and the Alcmæo­ <lb/>
            nids taking the contract from them for three hundred talents.7 <lb/>
            They claimed the right, supposed to be derived from their earliest <lb/>
            institution, of sitting injudgment upon disputes between Amphictyonic <lb/>
            cities; a right which it must have been difficult to exercise, except <note type="footnote"> (1) The meeting at Delphi, as well as that at Thermopylae, was called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ Πυλαία</foreign>, <lb/>

          <p>The most memorable instance of Amphictyonic action in the early <lb/>
            times is that known by the name of the first Sacred war, which ter­ <lb/>
            minated in the destruction of the city of Crissa, and afforded a pre­ <lb/>
            cedent for the punishment of the Phocians and Locrians two or <lb/>
            three centuries after. The Crissæans were charged with taking <lb/>
            extortionate tolls from the visitors who came to Delphi by sea from <lb/>
            the western parts of Greece, or from Italy and Sicily, and who came <lb/>
            across the Corinthian gulf into the Crissæan harbour. They were <lb/>
            charged (according to another account) with having encroached upon <lb/>
            the land of Apollo, and with having committed outrages upon some <lb/>
            Phocian and Argive women returning from the temple. Perhaps <lb/>
            all these charges were mixed together.2 War was declared by <lb/>
            the Amphictyons, at the instigation (according to Plutarch)3 of <lb/>
            Solon the Athenian. Clisthenes, king of Sicyon, was chosen to con­ <lb/>
            duct the war, in which the Athenians took an active part, under the <lb/>
            command either of Solon himself or of Alcmæon, and the Thessalians <lb/>
            under Eurylochus. The Crissæans were besieged, but they made <lb/>
            an obstinate resistance, and the war, like that of Troy, is said to <lb/>
            have lasted ten years. It was declared by the oracle, that Crisma <lb/>
            would never be taken, until the waves washed the territories of <lb/>
            Delphi. Solon advised, that the way to fulfil the oracle was to con­ <lb/>
            secrate to Apollo all the land of the Crissæans. This was done; <lb/>
            the besiegers solemnly vowed that the Crissæan land should be given <lb/>
            to Apollo, and should for ever lie waste: soon after this the city <lb/>
            was taken by stratagem. Solon diverted the stream of the Plistus; <lb/>
            and after poisoning the waters with the roots of hellebore, suffered <lb/>
            them to return to their former channel; the besieged drank them <lb/>
            with avidity and miserably perished. Thus Crissa fell, in the year <lb/>
            B.C. 585. The victors performed their vow, and after razing the city <lb/>
            to the ground, turned the whole of its domain into a wilderness. <lb/>
            The harbour was given to the Delphians, who now became masters <lb/>
            of the whole plain from Parnassus to the sea.4</p>
          <p>To commemorate this victory, the Ampbictyons, enriched by the <lb/>
            spoil of the conquered city, established the Pythian games, which <lb/>
            thenceforth were celebrated quadriennially in the third year of every <lb/>
            Olympic period. There had been anciently, established by the <lb/>
            Delphians themselves, an octennial musical festival, in one of which <lb/>
            it was said the poet Thamyris had obtained the prize. This was <note type="footnote"> (1) Strata, ix. 420. Demosthenes de Coron. 271. The suit there referred to was <lb/>

            enlarged into a more comprehensive one, including not only competi­ <lb/>
            tion in music and poetry, exhibitions of art in painting and sculpture, <lb/>
            but also gymnastic contests, with foot, horse, and chariot races, <lb/>
            after the model of the Olympic. These were not indeed established <lb/>
            all at once, but with additions in successive periods: the chariot <lb/>
            race was introduced in the second Pythiad, when Clisthenes of <lb/>
            Sicyon was the victor: a part of the Crissæan plain was converted <lb/>
            into the race-course. At the same time the prizes (which were at <lb/>
            first awarded as in the old musical contests) were abolished, and the <lb/>
            victor's meed was thenceforth a simple wreath of laurel; no less <lb/>
            efficacious than the Olympian olive to excite the emulation of com­ <lb/>
            petitors, striving for glory before the eyes of assembled Greece. The <lb/>
            games were under the immediate superintendence of the Amphic­ <lb/>
            tyonic deputies.1</p>
          <p>Of the history of the Phocians little is known till just before the <lb/>
            second Persian invasion. We learn that they had much difficulty in <lb/>
            maintaining their independence against the Thessalians, who, after <lb/>
            subduing most of the tribes north of Mount (Eta, endeavoured to <lb/>
            push their conquests southward. To check their incursions, the <lb/>
            Phocians had anciently, at a time when Thermopylae belonged to <lb/>
            them, closed up its western entrance with a wall, which, when <lb/>
            properly guarded, was deemed a complete barrier against an enemy <lb/>
            advancing from the Malian side. The pass had two gates or open­ <lb/>
            ings; one where the wall was built, which opened into the road from <lb/>
            Anthela to Trachis, giving room for a single wagon only to enter; <lb/>
            another, equally narrow, which opened about a mile to the east just <lb/>
            above the town of Alpeni. The space between the two gates was <lb/>
            considerably wider, and contained hot springs, salt or sulphureous, <lb/>
            which gave to the pass the name of Thermopylae, or Hot Gates.2 <lb/>
            The Phocians, besides blocking up the entrance, endeavoured to <lb/>
            make the road impassable by turning into it the water of the mineral <lb/>
            springs. These precautions however were rendered of no avail by <lb/>
            the discovery of a new road, which, commencing near Trachis, and <lb/>
            taking a westerly course up the gorge of the river Asopus, ascended <lb/>
            the mountain by a track called Anopæa, then turned eastward and <note type="footnote"> (1) Pausanias, x. 7, 33. Strabo, ix. 421. Archaeological Dictionary, title Pythia. <lb/>

              descended to Alpeni. The Trachinians having revealed this road to <lb/>
              the Thessalians, the pass ceased to be an invincible barrier, and the <lb/>
              wall soon afterwards was neglected or abandoned. It was probably <lb/>
              owing to this, that the Phocians lost the territory, which was after­ <lb/>
              wards acquired by the Epicnemidian Locrians. Certain it is, that <lb/>
              they became exposed to invasion from the north, and were reduced <lb/>
              to rely on their own valour for their safety.1 We have no particular <lb/>
              of the wars carried on between them and the Thessalians, until not <lb/>
              many years before the Persian invasion, when a Thessalian army <lb/>
              crossed the Locrian frontier, and were defeated by a stratagem at <lb/>
              Hyampolis. The Phocians, dreading their superiority in cavalry, put <lb/>
              into the ground a quantity of pots covered with loose earth; the <lb/>
              horses charging over these were lamed, and their riders overthrown <lb/>
              and slaughtered. To avenge this disaster, the Thessalians entered <lb/>
              Phocis with an immense force collected from all their confederate <lb/>
              cities. The Phocians terrified by their numbers, and further dis­ <lb/>
              heartened by the loss of a detachment whom they had sent to recon­ <lb/>
              noitre the enemy, made a huge funeral pile, and bringing together <lb/>
              all their women and children, their gold, silver, and other valuables, <lb/>
              and the images of their gods, gave them in charge to thirty of their <lb/>
              countrymen, with orders, in case they should be defeated, to kill the <lb/>
              women and children, and burn their bodies together with all the <lb/>
              property on the funeral pile, then to kill themselves or rush upon the <lb/>
              swords of the enemy. Having given such order, they marched to <lb/>
              meet the Thessalians, and fought with such desperation, that they <lb/>
              gained a great victory and delivered their country. From this <lb/>
              famed desperation became a proverb.2</p>
          <p>Herodotus and Pausanias, from whom we pick up these scraps <lb/>
            of history, mention also a successful night-attack made upon the <lb/>
            Thessalian camp by a select body of Phocians, having first whitened <lb/>
            their faces and shields with chalk, to distinguish them from <lb/>
            the enemy. According to Herodotus, the Phocians had first been <lb/>
            driven to the fastnesses of Parnassus. Pausanias relates, that the <lb/>
            Phocians in their alarm consulted the Delphian oracle, which returned <lb/>
            a mysterious answer, that Apollo would cause a mortal to encounter <lb/>
            an immortal, that he would give victory to both, but more complete <lb/>
            victory to the mortal. This was understood to be fulfilled after the <lb/>
            final battle, in which the Thessalians chose for their watchword <lb/>
            Itonian Pallas, the Phocians their Eponymous hero, Phocus. To <lb/>
            show their gratitude, the Phocians sent to Delphi statues of Apollo <lb/>
            and their own commanders, including the prophet Tellias of Elis, <lb/>
            under whose counsel they had acted.</p>
          <p>After the battle of Thermopylae the Thessalians had their revenge. <lb/>
            They were at first opposed to Xerxes, notwithstanding that the <lb/>
            Aleuadæ had invited him into Greece; and, while he was preparing to <note type="footnote"> (1) Herodotus, vii. 176, 199, 200, 215, 216. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) Herodotus, viiL 27, 28. Pausanias, x. 1. </note> <lb/>

            cross the Hellespont, they sent envoys to Peloponnesus, urging that <lb/>
            troops should be brought to guard the passes of Olympus, and prof­ <lb/>
            fering their assistance. Themistocles and Euænetus sailed with this <lb/>
            force to Halus, from whence they marched across Thessaly, and <lb/>
            joined by the Thessalian cavalry occupied the defiles of Tempe: <lb/>
            being informed however, that their position could easily be turned by <lb/>
            the enemy, they re-embarked their troops and sailed home. The <lb/>
            Thessalians then, finding that they could have no support from the <lb/>
            southern Greeks, tendered their submission to Xerxes, in which they <lb/>
            were followed by the Perrhæbians, Magnetos, and other northern <lb/>
            tribes, and also by the Dorians, Locrians, and Bœotians except­ <lb/>
            ing Thespiæ and Platæa. The Greeks determined on defending <lb/>
            Thermopylae, which Leonidas with an advanced body was sent to <lb/>
            occupy, whilst the fleet sailed to Artemisium, on the north of the <lb/>
            Eubœan channel, from which point they could freely communicate <lb/>
            with Leonidas, and prevent the Persians landing troops in his rear.1</p>
          <p>Leonidas, arriving at Thermopylae, invited the Phocians and the <lb/>
            Opuntian Locrians to join him. They both complied ; the Phocians <lb/>
            joining him with a thousand men, the Opuntian Locrians with their <lb/>
            whole forced He set to work immediately to repair the ancient <lb/>
            wall; but hearing now for the first time, that there was another <lb/>
            road over the mountains, he sent the Phocians, at their own request, <lb/>
            to defend it, while with the remainder of his forces he kept his <lb/>
            station in the pass. Most of the Greeks were struck with terror at <lb/>
            the approaching multitudes of the enemy, and desired to retreat to <lb/>
            the isthmus; it was with some difficulty, and chiefly owing to the <lb/>
            remonstrances of the Phocians and Locrians, anxious for the safety <lb/>
            of their own countries, that they were induced to remain at Thermo­ <lb/>
            pylæ. Xerxes, having marched through Macedonia and Thessaly, <lb/>
            arrived in the Malian territory, and encamped at Trachis, two miles <lb/>
            from the pass. After two days fighting, in which the Persians suf­ <lb/>
            fered prodigious loss, Xerxes learned from the Trachinians the ex­ <lb/>
            istence of the mountain road, and dispatched Hydarnes with a body <lb/>
            of Persians (who were called the Immortals) to march by night over <lb/>
            the cliff and fall upon the rear of Leonidas. The Persians, under the <lb/>
            guidance of Ephialtes the Trachinian, marched all night, and at day­ <lb/>
            break had mounted to the highest part of the rocky road, and were <lb/>
            heard by the Phocians, who grasped their arms and prepared for <lb/>
            battle; but soon, overwhelmed by the arrows of so numerous a host, <lb/>
            they fled to the brow of the cliff, where they awaited the enemy with <lb/>
            the intention of selling their lives dearly. Hydarnes, not caring to <lb/>
            attack the Phocians, pursued his march and descended the mountain. <lb/>
            The Greeks, hearing of his advance, had just time to retire from <note type="footnote"> (1) Herodotus, vii. 6, 172, 173, 174, 175. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πανστρατιῃ̃</foreign>. (Herodotus, vii. 203.) This means their whole force of heavy <lb/>

            their perilous situation, where Leonidas and his devoted band preferred <lb/>
            to remain and sacrifice themselves for the honour of their country.1</p>
          <p>Xerxes, advancing from Thermopylae, was reinforced by an addition <lb/>
            of Greek auxiliaries, the Malians, Dorians, Locrians, and Bœotians, <lb/>
            who now joined him with all their troops, excepting (as before) the <lb/>
            people of Thespiæ and Platæa.2 The Locrians would probably have <lb/>
            joined him at Thermopylae, for they had engaged to seize the pass for <lb/>
            him, but had been prevented by the arrival of Leonidas.3 The <lb/>
            Phocians, notwithstanding the advance of so numerous an army, still <lb/>
            refused submission. A message of a singular kind was sent to them <lb/>
            by the Thessalians, stating that they (the Thessalians) had great <lb/>
            influence with Xerxes, and that it depended on them whether the <lb/>
            Phocians should be reduced to slavery or otherwise; that they were <lb/>
            willing to forget past injuries, and, if the Phocians would give them <lb/>
            fifty talents, they would undertake to avert the tempest that was <lb/>
            about to fall upon them. The Phocians spurned this proposal. <lb/>
            Herodotus says, they sided with the Greeks purely out of hatred to <lb/>
            the Thessalians; that, if the Thessalians had been on the other side, <lb/>
            the Phocians would have been with the Mede. There seems how­ <lb/>
            ever scarcely any ground for attributing their conduct to such <lb/>
            a motive. The answer which the Phocians returned was, that <lb/>
            they would give no money, that they were at liberty to Medise as <lb/>
            well as the Thessalians, if they chose; but they would not consent to <lb/>
            betray the cause of Greece.4</p>
          <p>The Thessalians, on receiving this answer, conducted the barbarian <lb/>
            army into Phocis, entering it from the north by a narrow strip of <lb/>
            Dons which separates it from Mount (Eta, and commenced ravaging <lb/>
            the rich valley of the Cephisus. The Phocian people everywhere <lb/>
            fled before them. Some took refuge in the heights of Parnassus, <lb/>
            on a ridge of rocks called the Tithorea, above the city of Neon. The <lb/>
            greater part found shelter at Amphissa in Ozolian Locris. Mean­ <lb/>
            while the Persians laid waste the whole country, plundering and <lb/>
            destroying all in their way, and setting fire to the cities and the <lb/>
            temples. Fifteen of the principal cities, including Drymus, Charadra, <lb/>
            Tethronium, Amphicæa, Neon, Elatea, Hyampolis, Parapotamii, Abæ <lb/>
            with its oracular temple, and Panopeus, were burned to the ground.5</p>
          <p>A division of the army was sent to Delphi, with special orders <lb/>
            to seize the treasures of the temple. The Delphians in alarm inquired <lb/>
            of the oracle, whether they should bury their treasures, or carry <lb/>
            them away into another land; Apollo assured them, that he was able <lb/>
            to defend his own without their assistance. They then left their city, <lb/>
            seeking refuge on the mountains, in the Corycian cave, or at Am­ <lb/>
            phissa ; their wives and children they sent over to Achaia. Sixty <lb/>
            men only remained, with the chief-priest6 Aceratus. The barbarians <note type="footnote"> (1) Herodotus, vii. 201, 207, 208, 211, 213—223.</note> <note type="footnote">(2) Herodotus, viii. 66. </note><note type="footnote"> (3) Diodorus, xi. 4.</note> <note type="footnote">(4) Herodotus, viii. 29, 30. </note><note type="footnote"> (5) Herodotus, viii. 31, 32, 33, 35.</note> <note type="footnote">(6) See ante, p. 225, note 4. </note> <lb/>

            advanced, but hardly had they reached the temple of Pallas, which <lb/>
            stood in front of the Phcebean sanctuary, when their progress was <lb/>
            arrested by dreadful prodigies; a burst of thunder, the rolling of two <lb/>
            immense crags from Parnassus, which struck down several of their i <lb/>
            host, and a war-cry issuing from the shrine of Pallas. Smitten with <lb/>
            sudden panic, they turned and fled; the Delphians at that moment <lb/>
            rushed upon them and completed the rout, assisted (as the surviving <lb/>
            Persians themselves reported) by two superhuman figures in panoply, <lb/>
            who never ceased pursuing and slaughtering them till they reached <lb/>
            Boeotia. The Delphians declared these to be their own native <lb/>
            heroes, Phylacus and Autonous, who had portions of ground con­ <lb/>
            secrated to them in the neighbourhood of the temple. Thus did <lb/>
            Apollo fulfil his promise, and vindicate the sanctity of the oracle.,</p>
          <p>After this, it appears, a part of the Phocian people, those probably <lb/>
            whose cities had been spared, submitted with reluctance to Xerxes; <lb/>
            the rest maintained themselves in the mountains, from which they <lb/>
            made incursions from time to time against the Persian army. A <lb/>
            thousand Phocians however were sent to join Mardonius. They <lb/>
            came so tardily, that Mardonius, to mark his displeasure, or to <lb/>
            intimidate them for the future, or perhaps at first with a more serious <lb/>
            intention, ordered their troop to be drawn up in a plain, and sur­ <lb/>
            rounded them with his numerous cavalry. The Phocians, supposing <lb/>
            they were doomed to destruction, formed in a square, and with firm <lb/>
            countenance awaited the attack. The horsemen rode up with lifted <lb/>
            javelins, making a feint to charge, but as suddenly they wheeled round <lb/>
            and retreated. Mardonius applauded the Phocians for the courage <lb/>
            which they had shown, and assured them, if they behaved themselves <lb/>
            well in the ensuing campaign, they would be rewarded by the king. <lb/>
            At Platæa they were stationed with the Thebans and other Greek <lb/>
            allies of Xerxes, and in the battle were opposed to the Athenians; <lb/>
            but all, except the Thebans, fled without striking a blow, and Pau­ <lb/>
            sanias indeed states, that the Phocians deserted in battle to the <lb/>
            Greeks.2</p>
          <p>Of the spoils of the battle of Salamis the choicest part was sent to <lb/>
            Delphi, and devoted to the construction of a colossal statue. The <lb/>
            united Greeks inquired of the god, whether he was content with their <lb/>
            offerings; and he replied, that he was satisfied with those of the other <lb/>
            Greeks, but looked for a special gift from the Æginetans, to whom <lb/>
            the palm of valour had been awarded; they sent him accordingly <lb/>
            three golden stars fixed on a brazen mast. a At the close of the war <lb/>
            a tithe of the spoil was given to Apollo, and out of it was made <lb/>
            a golden tripod, placed by the Delphians on a three-headed brazen <lb/>
            serpent, which endured to the time of Pausanias. Shares were <note type="footnote"> (1) Herodotus, rill. 36—39; who represents that the two crags were shown to him <lb/>

            assigned also to the Olympian Jupiter and Isthmian Neptune.1 A cir­ <lb/>
            cumstance is related by Plutarch in the life of Aristides, which <lb/>
            proves the peculiar veneration in which the Delphian sanctuary <lb/>
            was held by the Greeks. Soon after the battle of Platæa the oracle <lb/>
            directed that an altar should be raised on the Platæan ground to <lb/>
            Jupiter the Deliverer; but, as the fires in the country had been <lb/>
            polluted by the barbarians, it commanded them to be extinguished, <lb/>
            and no sacrifice to be offered, till fire was brought from the hearth of <lb/>
            Apollo. To comply with this injunction, Euchidas, a Platæan, ran <lb/>
            in one day from Platæa to Delphi and back, carrying with him the <lb/>
            sacred fire, and at the moment of his return dropped down dead with <lb/>
            exhaustion. He was rewarded for his act of piety with a monument <lb/>
            in the temple of Diana.2</p>
          <p>A congress of the Amphictyons was held somewhere about this <lb/>
            time, at which divers resolutions were passed touching the events of <lb/>
            the war; among others, to offer a reward for Ephialtes, and decree a <lb/>
            monument to Leonidas, as I have already mentioned. It was moved <lb/>
            by the Lacedæmonians, that the Greeks who had joined Xerxes should <lb/>
            be expelled from the Amphictyonic council; but this proposal was <lb/>
            rejected by the deputies, under the advice of Themistocles, who <lb/>
            feared that, if the Thessalians, Thebans, and so many other members <lb/>
            were removed from the council, it would fall entirely under the <lb/>
            influence of Sparta.3</p>
          <p>In the long period which elapsed between the Persian and the <lb/>
            second Sacred War the Phocians interfered but little in the general <lb/>
            affairs of Greece ; they were forced from time to time into alliances <lb/>
            with the more powerful states, Athens, Sparta, or Thebes, in whose <lb/>
            wars they played but a subordinate part. To recover their power at <lb/>
            Delphi was a thing which they still aimed at, but were never able <lb/>
            fully to accomplish, owing to the interference of Sparta. In the year <lb/>
            457 B.c. they invaded the country of the Dorians, and took one <lb/>
            or two of their cities; but the Lacedæmonians marching against <lb/>
            them with a large Peloponnesian force defeated them in battle, and <lb/>
            compelled them to restore their conquest.4 After the victory of <lb/>
            (Enophyta, won in the following year by the Athenians under My­ <lb/>
            ronides over the Bœotians, not only the whole of Bœotia, but Phocis <lb/>
            also and Opuntian Locris, fell into the power of the Athenians, <lb/>
            and furnished them with auxiliary troops in an expedition which they <lb/>
            made against Pharsalus in Thessaly.5</p>
          <p>Just at this period Athens had acquired a vast accession of strength <lb/>
            as a land as well as a naval power, and the Phocians by their con­ <lb/>
            nexion with her were enabled, it seems, to become masters of Delphi; <lb/>
            for, in the year 448 B.C. it became necessary for the Lacedæmonians <note type="footnote"> (1) Herodotus, ix. 81. Pausanias, x. 13. Diodorus, xi. 33.

            to send an army into Phocis, to commence a sort of sacred war, <lb/>
            m which they got possession of the temple and delivered it. up to the <lb/>
            Delphians; but no sooner bad they retired, than the Athenians <lb/>
            marched into the country and restored the temple to the Phocians 1 <lb/>
            This state of things however was of short duration; for in the next <lb/>
            year the Athenians suffered the calamitous defeat at Coronea, by <lb/>
            which they lost Bœotia and the whole of their power in the northern <lb/>
            parts of Greece; and in two years after the thirty years truce was <lb/>
            concluded between them and the Lacedæmoniaus.2 Nine years later <lb/>
            We find the Lacedæmonians consulting the Delphian oracle, as to the <lb/>
            prospect of success in a war with Athens, and the god replying, <lb/>
            that, if they carried it on with all their might, they would get the <lb/>
            victory, and he would himself assist them : which may seem to indi­ <lb/>

            are in alliance with the Peloponnesians, and together with the <lb/>
            Bœotians and Locrians furnish a contingent of cavalry.6 Their old <lb/>
            enemies the Thessalians are not classed among the regular allies <lb/>
            of Athens, though the great mass of the people were friendly to her, <lb/>
            and succours of Thessalian horse were occasionally sent to the <lb/>
            Athenians; but many of the nobles in Thessaly favoured the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians, and they furnished assistance to Brasidas upon his march <lb/>
            to Thrace.</p>
          <p>At the truce for a year concluded between the Spartans and <lb/>
            Athenians, in the ninth year of the Peloponnesian war, the first <lb/>

          <p>" With respect to the temple and oracle of the Pythian Apollo, we <lb/>
            are content that all people who please may use them safely and <lb/>
            fearlessly, according to the national customs. The Lacedæmonians <lb/>

            generally from the continent of Greece, and unable either to consult the oracle, or <lb/>
            attend the Pythian games. This they sorely felt, and therefore in the peace that <lb/>
            followed, we find them expressly stipulating for liberty to all to attend the <lb/>
            public games. The grand display made by the Athenians, especially Alcibiades, <lb/>
            at the Olympic festival, which was celebrated in the eleventh year of the war, is <lb/>
            particularly noticed by Plutarch in his life of that extraordinary man. Compare <lb/>

            of the truce, has been a subject of question. It is not improbable that the Athenians i <lb/>
            may have charged their adversaries with taking some of the sacred property, and that <lb/>
            this clause was inserted to quiet them. </note> <lb/>

            will send heralds and persuade the Bœotians and Phocians, if they <lb/>

            honestly, according to the customs of our countries, and the rest who <lb/>
            agree, according to the customs of their countries respectively."</p>
          <p>At the peace of Nicias, concluded in the ensuing year, the first <lb/>
            articles were as follows.1</p>
          <p>" With respect to the national temples, it is agreed that all people <lb/>
            who please may sacrifice, and visit them, and consult the oracle, and <lb/>
            attend the festivals, according to the customs of their country, tra­ <lb/>
            veiling fearlessly both by sea and land. The temple and sanctuary <lb/>
            of the Delphian Apollo, and Delphi, shall be subject to their own laws, <lb/>
            their own taxation, and their own judicature, in regard both to persons <lb/>
            and land belonging to them, according to their ancient customs."</p>
          <p>From the above clauses we may perceive the great importance <lb/>
            attached by the leading states of Greece to Delphi and its oracle, to <lb/>
            the Pythian and other national festivals, and their anxiety to secure <lb/>
            free access to them for all the Greeks.</p>
          <p>We may notice also, that at this period everything is done by <lb/>
            Athens or Lacedæmon ; the rest are all absorbed into the alliance of <lb/>
            one or other of those cities; no national congress decides anything; <lb/>
            the Amphictyons are never even mentioned.</p>
          <p>Diodorus relates that in the year B.C. 418, during the interval of <lb/>
            the general peace, a war broke out between the Phocians and <lb/>
            Locrians, and that a battle was fought in which more than a thousand <lb/>
            of the Locrians were slain; 2 this is not mentioned by Thucydides, <lb/>
            but the fact is not therefore to be doubted. That there was a feud <lb/>
            between the Phocians and the Opuntian as well as Ozolian Locrians, <lb/>
            which led at a later period to important consequences, is abundantly <lb/>
            clear. Jealousies between neighbours in Greece, about some disputed <lb/>
            territory, or for other causes, were only too common: thus the <lb/>
            Phocians hated not only the Locrians, but the Bœotians; while <lb/>
            towards the Athenians they had friendly feelings, and were drawn <lb/>
            into the Peloponnesian alliance by compulsion.3 During the blockade <lb/>
            of Athens, when the allies debated whether mercy should be shown <lb/>
            to the vanquished, and many, especially the Corinthians and Thebans, <lb/>
            pressed for their destruction, the Phocians voted on the merciful side <lb/>
            of the question, which was carried, the Lacedæmonians having <lb/>
            strongly pronounced themselves in its favour.4 <note type="footnote"> (1) Thucydides, v. 18. It is scarcely possible to translate accurately the word <lb/>

          <p>In the year B.C. 395, a new combination was formed among the <lb/>
            states of Greece. Athens, Thebes, Corinth, and Argos were at the <lb/>
            head of a league against Lacedæmon; contrived originally by the <lb/>
            satrap Tithraustes, who sent money to Greece, in order to excite <lb/>
            a war and withdraw Agesilaus from Asia. Certain leading men in <lb/>
            Thebes, Corinth, and Argos, accepted the Persian gold, and proceeded <lb/>
            at once to perform the required service, in which they round not <lb/>
            much difficulty; for even at Thebes and Corinth the ancient feeling <lb/>
            of attachment to Sparta had for some time past been exchanged for <lb/>
            one of distrust and jealousy.1 The immediate cause of war was <lb/>
            a proceeding of the Theban statesmen, Androclidas, Ismenias, and <lb/>
            Galaxidorus, who, wishing to throw the odium of breaking peace <lb/>
            upon the Lacedæmonians, contrived to raise a quarrel between the <lb/>
            Phocians and Opuntian2 Locrians, which they expected would lead <lb/>
            to Spartan interference. They persuaded the Locrians to commit <lb/>
            a trespass upon some land which was the subject of dispute between <lb/>
            them and their neighbours. To punish this, the Phocians invaded <lb/>
            Locris, and carried off a large quantity of plunder. Androclidas and <lb/>
            his party then urged their countrymen to assist the Locrians; and <lb/>
            accordingly the Thebans marched into Phocis, and ravaged the <lb/>
            country. The Phocians sent to Sparta for succour, which was readily <lb/>
            granted; and Lysander was sent to Phocis, with orders to assemble <lb/>
            the forces of all the allies in that neighbourhood, namely, the <lb/>
            Phocians, Œtæans, Heracleots, Malians, and Ænianians, and lead them <lb/>
            to Haliartus in Bœotia, where the king Pausanias, who was to follow <lb/>
            with the Peloponnesian troops and take the chief command, appointed <lb/>
            to meet him on a given day. Lysander assembled the allies and <lb/>
            marched into Bœotia, where he rendered an important service by <lb/>
            detaching Orchomenus from the Theban confederacy, but afterwards, <lb/>
            making a rash attack upon Haliartus before the arrival of Pausanias, <lb/>
            he was defeated and slain. The Phocian and other allies dispersed. <lb/>
            Pausanias arrived soon after; but the Thebans being reinforced by <lb/>
            an Athenian army under Thrasybulus, he entered into a convention <lb/>
            and returned home; for which act he was banished from Sparta, and <lb/>
            died in exiled</p>
          <p>Soon after this a congress was held at Corinth, to consider what <lb/>
            measures should be taken against Sparta, and it was determined to <lb/>
            send embassies to the different states of Greece, to excite them <lb/>
            against her. A message came to them from Medius, chief of the <lb/>
            Aleuadæ of Larissa, requesting their aid against Lycophron, the <note type="footnote"> (1) Xenophon, Hellen. iii. c. 5, as. 1, 2. Plutarch, in Vit. Lysand. 27; in Vit. Ar­ <lb/>

            despot of Plerae, who was supported by the Lacedæmonians. Two <lb/>
            thousand of the allies under the command of the Theban Ismenias <lb/>
            were sent into Thessaly; with whose assistance Medius took the <lb/>
            city of Pharsalus, then held by a Lacedæmonian garrison; after which <lb/>
            Ismenias with a force of Bœotians and Arrives surprised the <lb/>
            Trachinian Heraclea,1 and, after putting to the sword the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians whom he found in that city, delivered it up to the ancient <lb/>
            inhabitants, whom he brought back from exile, strengthening them <lb/>
            with a garrison of Argives. He then persuaded the Ænianians and <lb/>
            Athamanians to change sides, and collecting an army of about <lb/>
            six thousand men, prepared to take revenge on the Phocians. They, <lb/>
            under the conduct of Lacisthenes a Laconian, marched into Locris <lb/>
            to meet him, but were defeated with a loss of nearly a thousand <lb/>
            men: Ismenias himself lost half that number; and the Phocians <lb/>
            returned home without further molestation.2</p>
          <p>The aspect of things was changed upon the return of Agesilaus <lb/>
            from Asia. That general, having crossed the Hellespont, marched <lb/>
            through Thrace and Macedonia into Thessaly. There he encountered <lb/>
            a large body of Thessalian horse, chiefly those of Larissa, Crannon, <lb/>
            Scotussa, and Pharsalus, who, being in close alliance with the <lb/>
            Bœotians, gathered round him to dispute his passage. Unsupported <lb/>
            by infantry, they would not venture to join in close combat with the <lb/>
            heavy-armed veterans of the Spartan, but hovered on his rear, and <lb/>
            distressed him by frequent charges, till at length Agesilaus by a suc­ <lb/>
            cessful manoeuvre attacked and put them to the rout. He then <lb/>
            pursued his march through Phthiotis, and passed thestrait of Ther­ <lb/>
            mopylæ.3 Joined by the troops of Phocis and Orchomenus, and by <lb/>
            a reinforcement from Peloponnesus, he met the united army of his <lb/>
            opponents, consisting of Bœotians, Athenians, Argives, Corinthians, <lb/>
            Ænianians, Euboeans, and Locrians, at Coronea; The victory won in <lb/>
            this field was purchased with hard fighting. Agesilaus severely <lb/>
            wounded withdrew to Delphi, where he offered up a tithe of his <lb/>
            spoils (being no less than a hundred talents) to Apollo: meanwhile <lb/>
            his lieutenant Gylis made an irruption into Locris, and plundered <lb/>
            the country without opposition till towards the evening, when the <lb/>
            Locrians, occupying some high ground by which the enemy had to <note type="footnote"> . (1) This city, though a pet colony of Lacedæmon, had never prospered. The <lb/>
            Thessalians and mountaineers of (Eta, who considered it was fortified against them, <lb/>
            continually annoyed and made war upon the new settlers, till they reduced it to <lb/>
            a very scanty population. The misgovernment of the Lacedæmonian officers cork­ <lb/>
            tributed to its ruin. In the twelfth year of the Peloponnesian war, it was in such a <lb/>
            state of weakness, that the Boeotians took possession of it, for fear the Athenians <lb/>
            might do the same, and they dismissed the Lacedæmonian governor. This how. <lb/>
            ever gave great offence at Sparta. (See Thucydides, iii. 92, 93, 100; v. 51, 52.) In <lb/>
            the year B. C. 399, the Lacedæmonians bad taken strong measures to reestablish <lb/>
            their power at Heraclea, and driven from their homes large numbers of the moun­ <lb/>

            return, fell upon their rear, and assailing them with missiles from, <lb/>
            the heights, slew both Gylis himself and many of his officers and <lb/>
            soldiers. The army of Agesilaus was soon afterwards disbanded, and <lb/>
            he sailed to Sparta.1</p>
          <p>The scene of war was afterwards removed to Peloponnesus, and <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians, being occupied nearer home, had not leisure tc <lb/>
            invade Bœotia or Attica.2 The war continued eight years, from B.C. <lb/>
            395 to B.C. 387, and was terminated by the peace of Antalcidas.3 <lb/>
            By this it was stipulated that the Greek states should be indepen­ <lb/>
            dent; an arrangement which virtually secured the leadership to <lb/>
            Sparta; for she was constituted guardian of the peace, and remained <lb/>
            at the head of a great alliance, keeping also her governors, or Har­ <lb/>
            mostæ, in a great number of cities, while Athens had no subjects left <lb/>
            her but the small islands of Lemnos, Imbrus, and Scyrus; and Thebes <lb/>
            was entirely deprived of her sovereignty over the Bœotian cities. At <lb/>
            first the Thebans demurred to accept the peace with that condition, and, <lb/>
            insisted on taking the oath in the name of all the Bœotians ; but <lb/>
            the threat of a war, in which they would be isolated from all their <lb/>
            allies, compelled them to accept the terms dictated by Sparta and the <lb/>
            Persian king. The Spartans were especially rejoiced at the humili­ <lb/>
            ation of Thebes, their views with respect to that city having been <lb/>
            entirely changed since the end of the Pelbponnesian war.4</p>
          <p>The Spartans were the first to violate the conditions of that very <lb/>
            peace which they so earnestly promoted, by their attack upon Man­ <lb/>
            tinea, whose walls they demolished, and whose citizens they dispersed <lb/>
            into villages.5 But their most signal violation of the treaty, as well <lb/>
            as of international faith and law, was the seizure of the Cadmea in <lb/>
            the year B.C. 382*, which brought a speedy retribution upon them­ <lb/>
            selves, and led to a total change in the position and prospects of the <lb/>
            other Greek states.6 Of the events which followed I can make but <lb/>
            cursory mention. The Thebans three years afterwards expel the <lb/>
            Spartan garrison, and Sparta declares war, which however she does <lb/>
            not prosecute with her accustomed activity. The Athenians, with <lb/>
            the instinctive impulse which prompted them so often to assist the <lb/>
            weak against the strong (an impulse both of policy and generosity), <lb/>
            support their neighbours in the apparently unequal contest; until, <lb/>
            after a seven years' war, the Thebans not only succeed in repulsing <lb/>
            the invader, but become strong enough to reconquer the Bœotian. <lb/>
            towns, two of which, Thespiæ and Platæa, they raze to the ground, <lb/>
            and expel the inhabitants. Immediately after this, the Athenians <note type="footnote"> (1) Xenophon, Hellen. iv. c. 3. ss. 15—23; c. iv. s. 1. Diodorus, xiv. 84. Plutarch,, <lb/>

            make peace on liberal terms with Sparta, and Thebes is left to fight <lb/>
            single-handed. The battle of Leuctra proved, contrary to the <lb/>
            vious opinion of the Greeks, that Thebes was a match, or more than <lb/>
            a match, for her rival in military prowess, and transferred to her that <lb/>
            preeminence as a land power which had so long exclusively belonged <lb/>
            to Sparta. The breaking up of the old Peloponnesian alliance, the <lb/>
            Theban invasion of Laconia, the foundation of Messene and Mega­ <lb/>
            lopolis, were the rapid and most important consequences of this <lb/>
            victory.1</p>
          <p>This period was marked not only by the display of an extraordi­ <lb/>
            nary martial spirit and energy on the part of the Thebans, but by <lb/>
            a great improvement in military tactics and organisation, due to the <lb/>
            genius of Epaminondas. His chief aim in battle seems to have been <lb/>
            that which has been pursued with success by generals in modem <lb/>
            times; namely, to concentrate his efforts upon some vital and deci­ <lb/>
            sive point, and at that point to make his attack with a numerous <lb/>
            force of the choicest troops; a system which often gives the advan­ <lb/>
            tage of superior numbers to an army less numerous on the whole <lb/>
            than the adversary. The institution of the Sacred Band—a select <lb/>
            body of three hundred men of the best families, intimately connected <unclear/> <lb/>
            sy ties of friendship, animated by the same spirit, and trained to act <lb/>
            together as one man in battle-had a good effect in exciting emula­ <lb/>
            tion and setting an example to the rest of the army. This band was <lb/>
            maintained in the Cadmea at the public cost. The whole body of <lb/>
            citizens composing the army were by constant exercises inured to <lb/>
            the discipline of war; and their fine appearance and martial bearing, <lb/>
            both in the camp and in the field, excited general admiration. The <lb/>
            leadership of Greece, thus transferred from Sparta to Thebes, may be <lb/>
            considered to have been held by her for about ten years, from the <lb/>
            battle of Leuetra to that of Mantinea, after which site declined.2</p>
          <p>Meanwhile Athens had profited by the rupture between Sparta <lb/>
            and Thebes, and by the dissatisfaction which the harsh measures of <lb/>
            Sparta had excited in Greece, to put herself at the head of a new <lb/>
            confederacy, including a great number of her old allies. Chios and <lb/>
            Byzantium, Rhodes and Mitylene, were the first to join her; others <lb/>
            soon followed: the alliance was formed upon an equitable basis; each <lb/>
            member of it was to be independent, and have an equal vote in the <lb/>
            congress, which was held at Athens. The Athenians applied them­ <lb/>
            selves vigorously to the augmentation of their navy, and the battle <note type="footnote"> (1) See my observations in the argument to the oration for the <unclear>Megalopolitass</unclear> <lb/>

            proved their valour at Tegyra, where they fought together, ever afterwards kept <lb/>
            them united, and charged at their head in the most difficult and dangerous anter­ <lb/>
            prises. This battle of Tegyra, he says, taught the Spartans, that it was net the <lb/>
            Eurotas that made men brave, but bravery was the produce of all countries</note> <lb/>
             <pb n="245"/>
            of Naxos, B.C. 376, made her again mistress of the sea. The Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians, making peace with Athens, B.C. 371, were content to <lb/>
            withdraw their governors from the towns which they had so long <lb/>
            kept in subjection, and to grant to the Greek states in reality that <lb/>
            independence of which the peace of Antalcidas had given them but <lb/>
            the name.1</p>
          <p>The further humiliation of Sparta, consequent upon the battle of <lb/>
            Leuctra, revived in the minds of the Athenians their ancient jealousies <lb/>
            of Thebes, and alarmed them also, for fear the balance of power <lb/>
            should incline too much in her favour. This again brought them <lb/>
            into connexion with Lacedæmon, and they conceived at one time the <lb/>
            idea that they might step into her place as protectors of the Pelo­ <lb/>
            ponnesian allies; a scheme not destined to be realized. The junction <lb/>
            of these two states however greatly contributed to check the am­ <lb/>
            bitious efforts of the Thebans, who, after the battle of Mantinea, <lb/>
            and the irreparable loss of their great general and statesman, Epami­ <lb/>
            nondas, found that they had only depressed their enemies without <lb/>
            being able to maintain their own position as the chiefs of a great <lb/>
            Hellenic confederacy. Athens, with her naval strength, her insular <lb/>
            alliance, and increasing commercial resources, was after the battle of <lb/>
            Mantinea unquestionably the first city in Greece. 2</p>
          <p>The Phocians, during the first eight years of the war with Thebes, <lb/>
            remained faithful to the Spartan alliance. They accompanied the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonian armies in the campaigns of Agesilaus and Cleom­ <lb/>
            brotus, and fought for them at Leuctra. In the year following the <lb/>
            battle of Tegyra, that is, B c. 374, the Thebans, having reduced the <lb/>
            Bæotian towns, carried their arms into Phocis; a measure which <lb/>
            (according to Xenophon) caused offence at Athens, on account of her <lb/>
            ancient connexion with that country. Cleombrotus arrived with <lb/>
            succours, and for the time the Thebans retreated; but after the battle <lb/>
            of Leuctra they were in a condition to persuade or compel almost <lb/>
            all their neighbours, except the Athenians, to join them. Xenophon <lb/>
            says, the Phocians became their subjects; Diodorus, their friends. <lb/>
            These different terms may perhaps represent the same thing; or it <lb/>
            may be, the mild and liberal policy of Epaminondas had prevailed <lb/>
            upon the Phocians to fall into his views. At all events they, with <lb/>
            the Eubœans, Locrians, Acarnanians, Heracleots, Malians, and Thes­ <lb/>
            sabans, formed a part of the army with which that general for the <lb/>
            first time invaded Laconia, B.C. 369. Yet on his last expedition, <lb/>
            before the battle of Mantinea, B.C. 362, the Phocians refused to <lb/>
            follow him, alleging that by the terms of their treaty they were bound <lb/>
            to defend the Thebans, if attacked, but not to join them in offensive <lb/>
            war. <note type="footnote"> (1) Diodorus xv. 28, 29, 34. Xenophon, Hellen. v. c. 4, as. 61—66; vi. c. 8, s. 18. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) Xenophon, Hellen. vi. c. 4, ss. 19, 20; c. 5, as,. 2, 3, 33—49. Demosthenes, <lb/>

          <p>The Thessalians had made but little advance, either in power or in <lb/>
            general estimation, among the Greeks, owing chiefly to their irregular <lb/>
            government and want of union. Unfaithful to their foreign alliances. <lb/>
            they were not more steady among themselves. A licentious aristo­ <lb/>
            cracy, devoted to the pleasures of the table and riotous amusements, <lb/>
            took no thought to improve the condition of their own dependents, muck <lb/>
            less to promote the welfare of their common country.1 Commanding <lb/>
            their various hordes of retainers,2 they broke out from time to time <lb/>
            into dissension and war with each other. A few great families, such <lb/>
            as the Aleuadæ of Larissa, the Scopadæ of Pharsalus and Crannon. <lb/>
            obtained by their wealth and influence a political power, which <lb/>
            extended itself more or less over the adjacent people. Occa <lb/>
            sionally some eminent man among these families was, either with <lb/>
            their consent, or by some other means, invested with a sort of des­ <lb/>
            potic authority under the title of Tagus. Thus, we have seen, Medius <lb/>
            was the chief of the Aleuadæ at Larissa. 3 In early times, as we <lb/>
            gather from the speech (to be noticed presently) of Polydamas, a <lb/>
            Tagus was appointed for the whole of united Thessaly, who, having <lb/>
            a large army and national revenue at his disposal, became a very <lb/>
            formidable potentate. The jealousy of the nobles, and their love of <lb/>
            rude independence, prevented any such authority being permanently <lb/>
            established. At Pheræ we find that a tyranny, that is, an unconsti­ <lb/>
            tutional sovereignty assumed without the consent of the people, pre­ <lb/>
            vailed for a considerable time. At the close of the Peloponnesian <lb/>
            war that city was governed by Lycophron, who formed the design of <lb/>
            reducing all Thessaly under his dominion, and defeated with great <lb/>
            slaughter the Larissæans and other Thessalians who opposed him.4 <lb/>
            This is the same Lycophron who was the ally of Sparta, and against <lb/>
            whom the Bœotians and their allies sent succours to Medius, as <note type="footnote"> (1) Isocrates, Epist. ad Philipp. ii. 410. Athenæus,vi. p. 260. Demosthenes, <lb/>

            before mentioned. Xenophon relates, that Aristippus of Larissa, being <lb/>
            a friend of Cyrus, obtained from him the loan of four thousand soldiers <lb/>
            with pay for six months, to assist him against an opposing faction in <lb/>
            his own city, and that Cyrus requested him not to make up his quarrel <lb/>
            without first consulting him. A portion of these soldiers, under the <lb/>
            command of Meno, were sent back to Cyrus, and marched with him <lb/>
            against his brother Artaxerxes.1 Whether the disturbances which <lb/>
            Aristippus desired to quell were, as Schneider thinks, connected with <lb/>
            the designs of Lycophron, or arose merely out of the domestic <lb/>
            quarrels of Larissa, we cannot determine.</p>
          <p>. Lycophron was succeeded by his son Jason, a man whose history <lb/>
            deserves particular attention. Inheriting his father's ambition, but <lb/>
            with greater vigour and capacity, he was enabled to accomplish the <lb/>
            scheme, which Lycophron had formed, of uniting all Thessaly under <lb/>
            his dominion. Connecting himself with Amyntas, king of Macedonia, <lb/>
            and Alcetas, king of Epirus, he conceived the idea, (at least after the <lb/>
            battle of Leuctra,) of seizing the vacant leadership of Greece, which <lb/>
            be considered that the Lacedæmonians had irretrievably lost, the <lb/>
            Thebans were not competent to hold, and no other power was pre­ <lb/>
            pared to strive for. The character of his designs, and the circum­ <lb/>
            stances which favoured them, are so vividly set forth in the statement <lb/>
            of Polydamas at Sparta, related by Xenophon, that I cannot do better <lb/>
            than give it in the words of that historian: 2</p>
          <p>In the year B.C. 374, about two years before the battle of Leuctra, <lb/>
            Polydamas of Pharsalus presented himself to the authorities at Sparta, <lb/>
            and requested an audience. He was a man of high reputation through­ <lb/>
            out all Thessaly, and so esteemed by the Pharsalians for his honour <lb/>
            and integrity, that in a time of civil broil they put their citadel into <lb/>
            his keeping, and entrusted him with the receipt of their revenues, out <lb/>
            of which he was to expend a fixed sum upon the public worship and <lb/>
            the general administration. This duty he faithfully discharged, main­ <lb/>
            taining a garrison in the citadel, defraying all the expenses of govern­ <lb/>
            ment, and accounting every year for what monies he received. If <lb/>
            there was a deficiency, he made it up out of his own private purse, <lb/>
            and repaid himself when there was a surplus. He was in general <lb/>
            given to hospitality and magnificence in the Thessalian fashion. In­ <lb/>
            troduced to the Lacedæmonian assembly, he addressed them thus:</p>
          <p>"Men of Lacedæmon, I have been your state-friend and bene­ <lb/>
            factor, as my ancestors have been from time immemorial; and I deem <lb/>
            it proper to apply to you if I am in any difficulty, and to give you <lb/>
            notice if any scheme adverse to your interests is formed in Thessaly. <lb/>
            You must have heard the name of Jason; for he is a man of great <lb/>
            power and celebrity. This Jason made a truce with me, obtained an <note type="footnote"> (1) Xenophon, Anabasis, i. c. 1, a. 10; c. 2. ss.1,6. Meno's character, as described <lb/>

            interview, and spoke as follows:—‘ Polydamas,' he said,‘ that I could <lb/>
            force your city of Pharsalus to submission, you may infer from what <lb/>
            I am about to say. I have most of the Thessalian cities, and those <lb/>
            of the greatest importance, allied to me; I brought them into sub­ <lb/>
            jection, notwithstanding that you fought on their side against me. <lb/>
            You know of course, that I have soldiers in my pay to the number <lb/>
            of six thousand, whom, I imagine, no city could easily resist. A <lb/>
            force equally numerous may be turned out elsewhere; but the state <lb/>
            armies have some men advanced in age, others not yet in their prime; <lb/>
            and very few in any city undergo bodily training; whereas no one is <lb/>
            in my pay who is not able to toil equally with myself.' Jason <lb/>
            (I must tell you the truth) has great personal strength, is generally <lb/>
            fond of labour, and makes a trial of his followers every day. For he <lb/>
            leads them with arms in hand both in their exercises and on their <lb/>
            marches; and whomsoever he sees fond of the toils and perils of war, <lb/>
            he rewards with double, treble, and quadruple pay, besides other <lb/>
            presents, and also with medical attendance in sickness, and with a <lb/>
            distinguished funeral; so that all his soldiers are sure that merit m <lb/>
            war procures for them a life of the greatest honour and abundance; <lb/>
            He showed me also (what I knew before), that the Maracians 1 and <lb/>
            Dolopians were subject to him, and Alcetas, the governor of Epirus. <lb/>
            ' Therefore,' said he, why should I have any doubt of being able to­ <lb/>
            subdue you easily P A person unacquainted with me might say- <lb/>
            Why then do you delay, and not march directly against the Pharsa­ <lb/>
            lians P Because I deem it infinitely better to gain you for willing <lb/>
            than for unwilling allies. For, were you forced into subjection, you <lb/>
            would be plotting all the mischief you could against me, and I should <lb/>
            desire you to be as weak as possible; whereas, if you are persuaded <lb/>
            to join me, it is plain we shall do our utmost to strengthen each <lb/>
            other. I perceive, Polydamas, that your country looks on you with <lb/>
            respect. If now you will bring it into friendly relations with me, <lb/>
            I promise you, that I will make you the greatest man in Greece next <lb/>
            to myself. What it is that I offer you the second place in, I beg you <lb/>
            to hear; and don't believe anything I say, unless on reflection you <lb/>
            judge it to be true. Well; this is evident, that by the accession of <lb/>
            Pharsalus and the cities dependent on you, I should easily become <lb/>
            Tagus of all the Thessalians: it is certain also, that, when Thessaly <lb/>
            is under a Tagus, her cavalry amount to six thousand men, and her <lb/>
            heavy-armed infantry are more than ten thousand. Looking at their <lb/>
            strength and spirit, I think, if they were well taken care of, there is <lb/>
            not a nation to which the Thessalians would endure to be subject <lb/>
            Vast as is the breadth of Thessaly, all the surrounding tribes are her <lb/>
            subjects, when a Tagus is appointed here; and nearly all the people <lb/>
            in these parts are armed with the javelin, so that probably we should <lb/>
            have an overpowering force of Peltastæ. Further, the Bœotians and <lb/>
            all now at war with Lacedæmon are my allies; and they are content <note type="footnote"> (1) An Ætolian people, adjacent to the Dolopians. See Schneider’s note. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="249"/>
            to follow me, if I will only deliver them from the Lacedæmonians. <lb/>
            Even the Athenians, I know, would do anything to obtain my alli­ <lb/>
            ance ; but I am not inclined to be connected with them, for I think <lb/>
            I could get the empire of the sea still more easily than that of the <lb/>
            land. Consider if this again be a reasonable calculation. Having <lb/>
            possession of Macedonia, from which the Athenians import their <lb/>
            timber, surely we shall be able to build more ships than they will; <lb/>
            and for manning them, which do you think would have more facilities <lb/>
            -the Athenians, or we, with so many valuable retainers ? For the <lb/>
            maintenance of seamen which would be the better provided—we, <lb/>
            who have such an abundance of corn that we export it elsewhere, or <lb/>
            the Athenians, who have not sufficient for themselves without buying <lb/>
            it ? And in all probability, I take it, we should have a more abun­ <lb/>
            dant supply of money, when we should not be dependent on little <lb/>
            islands, but enjoy the produce of continental countries; for it is <lb/>
            certain that all the people round pay tribute, when Thessaly is under <lb/>
            a Tagus. You know of course, that the Persian king, who is the <lb/>
            richest of men, derives his revenue not from islands but from the <lb/>
            continent. Him I believe I could conquer still more easily than <lb/>
            Greece; for I know that all people there but one are more addicted <lb/>
            to servitude than to fighting; and I know what a force marching up <lb/>
            with Cyrus, and what a force with Agesilaus, reduced the king to <lb/>
            extremities.' To this I replied, that everything which he had said <lb/>
            was worthy of consideration; but as we were the friends of Lace­ <lb/>
            daemon, it was impossible, I thought, to go over to their enemies, <lb/>
            without having: any ground of complaint. He commended me, and <lb/>
            said that my friendship was the more to be desired for my fidelity; <lb/>
            and he gave me leave to come and declare to you the truth, that he <lb/>
            intended to attack the Pharsalians, if we complied not with his <lb/>
            request. He bade me apply to you for assistance: 'and if they give <lb/>
            it you,' said he, ‘ that is, if you can persuade them to send sufficient <lb/>
            succours to carry on war with me, let us then abide the issue of the <lb/>
            wart whatever it may be; but if their aid be not in your opinion suf­ <lb/>
            ficient, your country may have cause to complain of you—that <lb/>
            country in which you are honoured and enjoy the highest prosperity.’ <lb/>
            Upon this matter therefore I am come to you, and I tell you all <lb/>
            that I see myself in that country, and all that I have heard from <lb/>
            him. And, men of Lacedæmon, the state of things I conceive to be <lb/>
            this:—If you will send a force that, not only in my judgment, but <lb/>
            in that of the Thessalians in general, is adequate to maintain a war <lb/>
            with Jason, the cities will revolt from him; for they are all watching <lb/>
            with alarm the progress of his power. If you suppose however, <lb/>
            that your emancipated Helots and a mart of private station will be <lb/>
            sufficient, I advise you to keep quiet. For be assured, that the war <lb/>
            will be against a formidable array of strength, and against a man <lb/>
            who is so prudent a general, that whatever he attempts, whether in <lb/>
            the way of stratagem, or surprise, or open attack, he hardly ever <lb/>
             <pb n="250"/>
            fails. He can make the same use of the night as of the day, and on <lb/>
            occasions of haste he can work while he is taking his meals. He <lb/>
            thinks it time to rest, when he has returned to the place from which <lb/>
            he started and transacted his business. And his followers he has <lb/>
            inured to the same habits. When the soldiers have by their exer­ <lb/>
            tions achieved a good piece of success, he knows how to excite their <lb/>
            imaginations; so that his men are taught this, that relaxation is pro­ <lb/>
            cured by toil. Moreover, in regard to sensual pleasures, he is the <lb/>
            most temperate man I know; so that nothing of this kind keeps <lb/>
            him from the regular performance of his duty. Consider then, and <lb/>
            tell me, as is but fair, what you will be able and what you intend <lb/>
            to do."</p>
          <p>For the particulars of this remarkable speech we can rely on the <lb/>
            account of Xenophon, who had good opportunities of learning them <lb/>
            at Sparta. It is interesting in one point of view especially, as show­ <lb/>
            ing that the divisions of the Greek states had even at this time <lb/>
            excited in the breast of one ambitious man the hope of conquering <lb/>
            them all. The grounds upon which Jason founded his hopes were <lb/>
            pretty nearly the same as those which formed the basis of Philip's <lb/>
            calculations, when he strove for the mastery of Greece. The circum­ <lb/>
            stances were indeed much more favourable to Philip than to Jason. <lb/>
            We can scarcely help charging the latter with exaggeration in his <lb/>
            estimates, and perhaps with some degree of ignorance and presump­ <lb/>
            tion, if we suppose him to have spoken his real opinions to Poly­ <lb/>
            damas. He seems to have overrated the quality of his own infantry, <lb/>
            as compared with those of the Greek states; certainly he overrated <lb/>
            his chances of obtaining maritime ascendency. The facility with <lb/>
            which Alexander was afterwards overpowered by the Thebans shows <lb/>
            in some degree the precarious character of the force on which Jason <lb/>
            depended. Philip held a constitutional monarchy, inherited from his <lb/>
            ancestors, and had brought his army to a high state of discipline, the <lb/>
            efficiency of which he had tried in many bloody encounters with his <lb/>
            warlike neighbours, before he ventured to attack the southern Greeks: <lb/>
            even then he proceeded with the utmost caution. He never in his <lb/>
            life established a navy which was able to cope with the Athenian; <lb/>
            and when he attacked the Greeks, they were far weaker and more <lb/>
            divided than at the time of the battle of Leuctra. It is next to cer­ <lb/>
            tain, that Jason would have failed in the attempt in which Philip <lb/>
            succeeded. The characters of the two men however were very I <lb/>
            similar.1</p>
          <p>The Lacedæmonians took two days to consider their reply to Poly­ <lb/>
            damas, and on the third day, seeing how many of their troops were <lb/>
            employed in the war with Thebes and Athens, they informed him <note type="footnote"> (1) See the observations of Isocrates, Philipp. p. 106. Cicero compares Jason, as a <lb/>
            crafty politician, with Themistocles. (De Officiis, i. 30.) Aristotle mentions a saying <lb/>
            of his, “that it is lawful to do some evil, in order to effect great good." (Rhetonc, <lb/>
            L 12, 31.) Compare the anecdotes of Polyænus, Strateg. vi. 1. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="251"/>
            that for the present they were unable to send out any adequate <lb/>
            succours, and advised him to return and do the best that he could <lb/>
            for himself and his city. He thanked them for their straightforward <lb/>
            answer, and left them. On his return, he begged Jason not to compel <lb/>
            him to give up the citadel, which had been entrusted to his keeping; <lb/>
            but gave his own sons as hostages, and promised that he would bring <lb/>
            his country over to Jason's alliance, and help to make him Tagus. <lb/>
            Both these things were accomplished. The Pharsalians entered into <lb/>
            a treaty with Jason, and he was appointed Tagus of all Thessaly. He <lb/>
            then arranged the contingents which every city was to furnish of <lb/>
            cavalry and heavy-armed infantry; and it was found, that the cavalry <lb/>
            of the Thessalians and their allies numbered more than eight thou­ <lb/>
            sand, their heavy-armed infantry as many as twenty thousand, besides <lb/>
            an immense force of Peltastæ.</p>
          <p>In the following year, B.C. 373, Jason came with Alcetas of Epirus <lb/>
            to Athens, to intercede with the people on behalf of Timotheus, who <lb/>
            was brought to trial for his delay in carrying succours to Corcyra. <lb/>
            Timotheus was at that time so poor, that to entertain his illustrious <lb/>
            visitors, who lodged in his house in the Piræus, he was obliged to. <lb/>
            borrow some articles of dress and furniture, two silver cups, and a <lb/>
            mina in money. Their intercession prevailed, but he was removed <lb/>
            from his commando</p>
          <p>After the battle of Leuctra the Thebans sent to Jason for assist­ <lb/>
            ance, wishing to complete the rout of the defeated army, and fearing <lb/>
            the arrival of reinforcements from Peloponnesus. Jason, intending to <lb/>
            march through Phocis, gave orders to prepare a fleet, as if he was <lb/>
            going by sea; then with a small body of troops, before the Phocians <lb/>
            had time to assemble, he passed rapidly through their territory and <lb/>
            joined the Bœotian army. The Thebans wished him to fall upon the <lb/>
            rear of the Peloponnesians, who were still encamped in Bceotia, <lb/>
            while they attacked them in front; but Jason advised, that it was <lb/>
            better to let them quit the country than to risk the chance of <lb/>
            another battle, in which the desperation of the enemy might give <lb/>
            them the victory. He then went to the adversary's camp, (for not­ <lb/>
            withstanding his alliance with Thebes, he still kept up his hereditary <lb/>
            connexion with Sparta,) and he represented to the Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            how dangerous it might be for them to stay in Bœotia in the presence <lb/>
            of a victorious army, with allies not hearty in their cause, and who <lb/>
            were thinking even of treating with the enemy. His counsels pre­ <lb/>
            vailed, and the Lacedæmonians, after concluding an armistice, re­ <lb/>
            treated. Jason gained his object, which was, to attach both parties <lb/>
            to himself, and let neither obtain any decisive advantage. He then <note type="footnote"> (1) Demosthenes, cent. Timoth. 1187, 1190, 1191. Xenophon, Hellen. vi. c. 2, <lb/>

            returned by Phocis, attacking Hyampolis on his road, and doing <lb/>
            considerable damage to its town and territory; after which, passing <lb/>
            by Heraclea, he razed the walls, to prevent it being used as a fortress <lb/>
            against him when he marched southward.1</p>
          <p>In the following year Jason took steps which opened the eyes of <lb/>
            Greece yet more clearly to his designs. The Pythian festival was <lb/>
            coming on. He ordered preparations to be made on a great scale, for <lb/>
            the sacrifice; each city in his dominion was required to furnish a cer­ <lb/>
            tain number of oxen, sheep, goats, and swine; the total of which, <lb/>
            without any city being heavily charged, amounted to a thousand <lb/>
            oxen, and ten thousand of the smaller animals: and he offered the <lb/>
            reward of a golden crown to the city which produced the finest ox. <lb/>
            He gave notice to the Thessalians to prepare themselves for a military <lb/>
            expedition by the time of the festival: it was supposed that he <lb/>
            intended to hold the games under his own presidency, and there were <lb/>
            misgivings as to his designs on the Delphian treasures. The Del­ <lb/>
            phians asked the oracle, what was to be done if he laid his hands <lb/>
            upon them; and Apollo replied, that he would see to it. Whatever <lb/>
            his schemes may have been, they were brought to a sudden termina­ <lb/>
            tion. One day, after he had held a review of his cavalry at Pheræ, <lb/>
            he sat in his chair of state to give audience to his subjects, when <lb/>
            seven youths, under the pretence of asking his judgment upon <lb/>
            some private quarrel, advanced close up to him, and, before his guards <lb/>
            had time to interpose, savagely attacked and murdered him. One <lb/>
            of them was slain in the act of striking; a second was taken and <lb/>
            instantly put to death; the other five jumped on horses that were <lb/>
            ready for them, and effected their escape. In every Greek city, <lb/>
            through which they passed, honours were conferred upon the <lb/>
            assassins; a proof how great had been the terror excited by <lb/>
            enterprises of this man.2</p>
          <p>Jason was succeeded by his brothers Polydorus and Polyphron; <lb/>
            the former of whom came to a sudden death, not without suspicion <lb/>
            of foul play. Polyphron, on whom suspicion fell, confirmed the bad <lb/>
            opinion of his subjects by various tyrannical acts. He put to death <lb/>
            Polydamas and eight other of the principal citizens of Pharsalus; and <lb/>
            drove many from Larissa into exile. After governing Thessali for <lb/>
            one year, he was murdered by his nephew Alexander, who surpassed <lb/>
            him in vice and cruelty, and in a short time drove the Thessalians <lb/>
            to solicit foreign aid. This brought back Thessaly to a state of <lb/>
            disunion and weakness. Alexander, notwithstanding the combination <lb/>
            against him, maintained his power in Pheræ and the adjacent towns, <lb/>
            and reigned altogether about eleven years, siding alternately with <lb/>
            Thebes and Athens, and doing no little mischief to both.3 <note type="footnote"> (1) Xenophon, Hellen. vi. c. 4, so. 20—27. The account which Diodorus gives of <lb/>

          <p>The Aleuads of Larissa made the first effort for the deliverance of <lb/>
            their country, by inviting to their assistance Alexander king of Mace­ <lb/>
            don. The young king, who had just succeeded his father Amyntas, <lb/>
            came promptly at their request, and, while the tyrant of Pheræ was <lb/>
            preparing to carry the war into Macedonia, took by surprise the cities <lb/>
            Of Larissa and Crannon, and put garrisons in both.1 But he was <lb/>
            soon recalled to his own kingdom, probably by the intrigues of his <lb/>
            mother Eurydice and Ptolemy of Alorus; and the Thessalians, again <lb/>
            pressed by the tyrant, invoked the aid of Thebes. Pelopidas was <lb/>
            sent with an army, and with orders to settle the affairs of Thessaly in <lb/>
            the best manner for Theban interests. Having advanced to Larissa, <lb/>
            which was surrendered to him, he had an interview with Alexander <lb/>
            of Pheræ, and reproached him so severely for his conduct, that <lb/>
            Alexander, in alarm for his safety, retired to Pheræ, leaving the <lb/>
            Theban general to settle matters as he chose with his allies in <lb/>
            Thessaly. Pelopidas made such arrangements for the future govern­ <lb/>
            ment of Thessaly as were generally acceptable to his allies, and in <lb/>
            accordance with his instructions from home. He proceeded also to <lb/>
            Macedonia, where he strengthened his country's cause by an alliance <lb/>
            which he concluded with king Alexander, receiving from him (accord­ <lb/>
            in,- to Diodorus) his brother Philip, then fifteen years old, as a hos­ <lb/>
            tage ; 2 after which he returned into Bœotia, leaving Thessaly, through <lb/>
            which he again passed, apparently tranquil. The year however had <lb/>
            scarcely passed, when Theban interference was again solicited, on <lb/>
            account of some new oppressions from Pheræ. Pelopidas and Isme­ <lb/>
            nias were sent, but without troops, in the character of ambassadors; <lb/>
            for it was thought, that their name and presence would be sufficient <lb/>
            to overawe the tyrant. This expectation was futile. Alexander <lb/>
            came with an army to Pharsalus, where a conference was appointed <lb/>
            to be held between him and the Theban generals; and they impru­ <lb/>
            dently put both the city and themselves into the power of a man <lb/>
            who was totally regardless of good faith and honour. He seized <lb/>
            their persons, carried them prisoners to Pheræ, and treated them with <lb/>
            the utmost indignity. To avenge this insult, the Thebans sent <lb/>
            Hypatus and Cleomenes into Thessaly, with an army of eight thou­ <lb/>
            sand foot and six hundred horse; to oppose which Alexander, not <lb/>
            trusting entirely to his own forces, applied to the Athenians, who <note type="footnote"> tome particulars. Plutarch (in Vit. Pclopid. 29) agrees with Xenophon in making <lb/>
            Alexander the nephew, not the brother of Polydorus. See Schneider and Wesse­ <lb/>

            tended to hold Larissa and Crannon for himself. Pelopidas, therefore, thought it <lb/>
            necessary to secure his fidelity. Diodorus, however, gives a different account of the <lb/>
            manner in which Philip came to be sent to Thebes, Lib. xvi. 2. Plutarch (in Vit. <lb/>
            Pelopid. 26 et seqq.) states that Pelopidas was invited to Macedonia, to settle the <lb/>
            disputes between Alexander and Ptolemy; and also that he went upon a second <lb/>
            occasion, after the murder of Alexander, and compelled Ptolemy to give hostages to <lb/>
            ensure his proper administration as regent. See Grote's views as to the different <lb/>

            despatched to his assistance a fleet of thirty sail and a thousand <lb/>
            soldiers, under the command of Autocles. The Thebans approaching <lb/>
            Pheræ were met by Alexander with a force greatly superior in cavalry, <lb/>
            notwithstanding which, they desired to attack him; but before they <lb/>
            could join battle, their Thessalian allies deserted; Alexander was <lb/>
            reinforced by the troops of Athens and other auxiliaries, and the <lb/>
            Thebans, distressed for provisions, found it necessary to retreat. <lb/>
            Their march was through an open plain; Alexander assailed their <lb/>
            rear with his cavalry and javelin-men, who did such execution, that <lb/>
            the whole of the Theban army was in peril. The soldiers, almost in <lb/>
            despair, called upon Epaminondas, who was serving among them as <lb/>
            a volunteer,' to take the command. He quickly restored confidence; <lb/>
            forming a rear-guard with his horse and light troops, he repulsed the <lb/>
            pursuing enemy, and effected his retreat in safety.- <lb/>
            The Thebans fined Hypatus and Cleomenes on their return for <lb/>
            misconduct, and chose Epaminondas for their general, to retrieve the <lb/>
            fortune of the war. He proceeded early in the year B.C. 367 to <lb/>
            execute his commission; but Alexander, fearing to encounter a Theban <lb/>
            army under such a general, and perhaps disappointed of some ex­ <lb/>
            pected aid from Athens,3 thought proper to come to terms, and <lb/>
            consented to release his prisoners. Epaminondas, having accomplished <lb/>
            the main objects of the expedition, withdrew his army.4</p>
          <p>During three years that followed, the Thebans, as it appears, had <lb/>
            no leisure to attend to the affairs of Thessaly; and Alexander used <lb/>
            the opportunity thus afforded him for exercising his cruelty and <lb/>
            extending his power. He occupied with garrisons the districts of <lb/>
            Magnesia and Phthiotis. In Melibœa and Scotussa he perpetrated <lb/>
            frightful massacres. The citizens in each of these were summoned to <lb/>
            a general assembly, to answer some complaints which he had against <lb/>
            them: he then surrounded them with his guards, who speared them <lb/>
            all, and cast their bodies into the town-moat. The cities were given <lb/>
            up to plunder, and the women and children sold for slaves. 5</p>
          <p>In the year B.C. 364 the Thebans were again solicited to chastise <lb/>

            troops set out, there was an eclipse of the sun, an event which was <lb/>
            considered an unlucky omen among the Greeks. The expedition was <lb/>
            postponed : but Pelopidas with a small band of volunteers proceeded <lb/>
            to Pharsalus, and putting himself at the head of his Thessalian con­ <lb/>
            federates, did not fear to meet Alexander with an army double his <lb/>
            own number. They fought at Cynoscephalæ, and Alexander was <lb/>
            defeated; but unfortunately Pelopidas, pressing rashly forward and <lb/>
            challenging the tyrant to personal combat, was overpowered by num­ <lb/>
            bers and slain. He was honoured with a splendid funeral by the <lb/>
            Thessalians, who requested as a special favour of the Thebans, that <lb/>
            he might be buried in their country.' The war was vigorously <lb/>
            prosecuted; the Theban reinforcements arriving, defeated Alexander <lb/>
            in a second and more decisive battle, and constrained him to accept <lb/>
            a peace, by the terms of which he was to withdraw his garrisons from <lb/>
            Magnesia and Phthiotis, confine himself to his hereditary dominion of <lb/>
            Pherme, and also become a subject ally of Thebes. Troops both of <lb/>
            Alexander and the independent Thessalians served under Epaminon­ <lb/>
            das in the campaign of Mantinca.2</p>
          <p>Peace with Thebes had severed Alexander from the alliance of <lb/>
            Athens; and he turned his attention to the equipment of a navy, <lb/>
            chiefly with a view to enrich himself by piracy. Pagasæ, the port of <lb/>
            Pheræ, was conveniently situated for an outlet into the Ægæan sea, <lb/>
            and the small islands off the coast of Thessaly, then belonging to <lb/>
            Athens, were exposed to his attack. In the year B.C. 361 he took <lb/>
            the island of Tenus, and made slaves of the inhabitants. The next <lb/>
            year he took or pillaged several other of the Cyclad isles, and made <lb/>
            a descent on Peparethus; he even defeated an Athenian fleet, cap­ <lb/>
            tured six vessels and a large number of prisoners, and then suddenly <lb/>
            sailed into the Piræus, landed on the quay, and carried off considerable <lb/>
            plunder. The Athenians were so incensed with their commander <lb/>
            Leosthenes, for his negligence in permitting such disasters, that they <lb/>
            sentenced him to deaths</p>
          <p>We now approach the period of the Sacred War, the causes of <lb/>
            which could not easily be explained without first presenting before <lb/>
            the reader a general view of Grecian affairs, and of the relation <note type="footnote"> (1) Pelopidas was as able an officer, as Epaminondas was a general. The victory <lb/>
            at Leuctra was as much owing to his prompt and timely charge with the Sacred <lb/>
            Band, as to the main design of the battle by his colleague. In other respects, Pelo­ <lb/>
            pidas was one of the best characters of antiquity; a true patriot, brave, generous, <lb/>
            unselfish. These qualities were perhaps not sufficiently tempered with prudence. <lb/>
            His rashness in battle (for which Plutarch blames him) cost him his life. He is <lb/>
            compared by the biographer with Marcellus, who owed his death to a similar and <lb/>
            less excusable want of caution. Compare Polybius, viii. 1. Diodorus, xv. 81. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) Diodorus, xv. 80, 85. Xenophon, Hellen. vii. c. 5, a. 4. Plutarch, in Vit. <lb/>

            in which the various parties stood to each other at the time when <lb/>
            the war broke out.</p>
          <p>After the general peace which followed the battle of Mantinea, <lb/>
            the Thebans found that their influence among the Greek states was <lb/>
            considerably diminished. This may have been owing partly to the <lb/>
            severity of their proceedings against the Bœotian cities, which <lb/>
            offended the feelings of the Greeks, partly to the fears and jealousies <lb/>
            of the independent states. Theban headship was a thing which they <lb/>
            had not been accustomed to, and which they could hardly reconcile <lb/>
            to sentiments of Hellenic patriotism.1 Accordingly, though alliance <lb/>
            of the most friendly kind subsisted between the Thebans and the <lb/>
            Argives, Megalopolitans, and Messenians, the last of whom owed their <lb/>
            very existence as a nation to Epaminondas, the Thebans could no <lb/>
            longer sway the counsels of these confederates, so as to make them <lb/>
            subservient to ambitious views of their own. In the north, they <lb/>
            were in friendly connexion with the Locrians and Thessalians ; while <lb/>
            towards the Phocians they had entertained feelings of anger and <lb/>
            hostility, ever since that people had refused to join them in their last <lb/>
            expedition to Peloponnesus. But the principal check to the am­ <lb/>
            bition of Thebes was Athens, who by her maritime situation and <lb/>
            resources was secure against attack, and could offer protection to <lb/>
            her weaker neighbours against Theban encroachment. Epaminondas <lb/>
            had seen, that his country would never retain her ascendency in <lb/>
            Greece, unless she applied herself to maritime affairs, and strove to <lb/>
            compete with Athens for the dominion of the sea. The year before <lb/>
            his death he made an exciting speech before the people, encouraging <lb/>
            them to aim at naval supremacy, and boldly declaring that the Pro­ <lb/>
            pylæa of the Athenian Acropolis should be transferred to the Cadmea. <lb/>
            A decree was passed at his suggestion for the construction of an <lb/>
            arsenal and a hundred vessels of war; and Epaminondas was actually <lb/>
            sent with an armament to the Ægæan and the Propontis, to excite <lb/>
            revolt among the Athenian allies. He succeeded so far as to drive <lb/>
            an Athenian squadron from the sea, and obtain promises of alliance <lb/>
            from Chios, Rhodes, and Byzantium, the same states which, a few <lb/>
            years later, took the lead in the Social War against Athens.2 These <lb/>
            naval projects however died with Epaminondas; nor indeed was <lb/>
            Thebes favourably situated for becoming a maritime power, unless <lb/>
            aim had possession of Euboea. Here again was a fruitful subject of <lb/>
            contention with Athens, to whom the dominion, or at least the <lb/>
            friendship, of Euboea was of immense importance in more than one <lb/>
            point of view. The people of that island had most of them joined <lb/>

            of the Orites, who resisted all the efforts of Chabrias to make himself <lb/>
            master of their city., When Athens went over to Sparta, the The­ <lb/>
            ban interest seems to have prevailed in the island; for Eubœans are <lb/>
            numbered among the troops that followed Epaminondas to Pelopon­ <lb/>
            nesus. Eubcea itself, however, was much divided. Tyrants sprang <lb/>
            up in some of the cities, who were ready to side with either Athens <lb/>
            or Thebes, according as it suited their views. Such were Mnesarchus <lb/>
            of Chalets and Themison of Eretria.3 The latter had in the year <lb/>
            B.C. 366 inflicted a great blow upon Athens, by causing her to lose <lb/>
            Oropus. He assisted some exiles, sallying from Eubcea to get pos­ <lb/>
            session of it; and the Athenians, after sending forces for its <lb/>
            recovery, were persuaded to enter into an arrangement, by which <lb/>
            the Thebans were to hold the city in trust, until the claims of the <lb/>
            contending parties could be decided. Instead of this ever being done, <lb/>
            the Thebans, not liking to part with a place so desirable for the <lb/>
            command of Eubœa, kept it in their own hands, nor was it restored <lb/>
            even at the general peace.3</p>
          <p>In the year B.C. 358 or, 357, Eubœa was the scene of a short but <lb/>
            fierce contest between the Athenians and Thebans. It was brought <lb/>
            about by some internal disputes in the island, in which the aid of <lb/>
            Thebes was invoked against the despots Mnesarchus and Themison. <lb/>
            The Thebans, to support their partisans and maintain their supre­ <lb/>
            macy in Eubœa, sent over a large force; while their opponents <lb/>
            applied for succour to the Athenians. At this time hardly a city in <lb/>
            Eubcea was connected with the Athenians, except Oreus perhaps, <lb/>
            which the Spartan alliance may have brought over to them. A good <lb/>
            opportunity now presented itself to recover their power in the island. <lb/>
            Still they hesitated, either doubting their chance of success, or sus­ <lb/>
            pecting the sincerity of the parties who invited them : a debate was <lb/>
            held on the question, when Timotheus starting up made that forcible <lb/>
            appeal to his countrymen, which is related by Demosthenes in the <lb/>
            Oration on the Chersonese—“ Are you deliberating what to do, when <lb/>
            you have the Thebans in the island ? Will you not cover the sea <lb/>
            with galleys ? Will you not rush to the Piræus immediately and <lb/>
            launch your ships P "-The people, roused by this language, voted <lb/>
            war on the instant; and such was their zeal, aided by the patriotism <lb/>
            of many wealthy citizens who volunteered to serve the office of <lb/>
            trierarch, (among them Demosthenes himself,) that the whole arma­ <lb/>
            ment was equipped and sent off within five days. The campaign <lb/>
            lasted about a month, during which there was no decisive action, but <lb/>
            a great deal of fighting and much loss of life on both sides. The <lb/>
            general result was to the advantage of the Athenians, who forced <lb/>
            their adversaries into a convention, by which they agreed to evacuate <lb/>
            the island; and having freed it from the presence of the Theban <note type="footnote"> (1) Diodorus, xv. SO.</note> <note type="footnote">(2) Æschines, contr.

            army, and withdrawing themselves from further interference, were <lb/>
            regarded as benefactors, and honoured with a golden crown. The <lb/>
            Eubœan cities, left to their own domestic governments, were re­ <lb/>
            annexed to the Athenian confederacy, and severed entirely from the <lb/>
            dominion of Thebes.1</p>
          <p>Such was the position of affairs, when the Thebans in an evil hour <lb/>
            for Grecian liberty determined on taking a step, by which, while they <lb/>
            gratified their revengeful feelings against their enemies, they hoped <lb/>
            possibly to exalt themselves at their expense. This was to invoke <lb/>
            upon them the sentence of an Amphictyonic assembly. It was a <lb/>
            long time since the Amphictyons had taken any active part in <lb/>
            Grecian politics. Their periodical meetings had been regularly held <lb/>
            as usual, in the spring at Delphi, in the autumn at Thermopylae; but <lb/>
            their attention had been confined wholly to religious ceremonies and <lb/>
            local business, without meddling in the more momentous questions <lb/>
            of war and peace or other international concerns. The Thebans, on <lb/>
            friendly terms with the majority of the Amphictyonic tribes, deemed <lb/>
            it a good opportunity to revive the dormant functions of the coun­ <lb/>
            cil, and make it a political engine for their own purposes. This, under <lb/>
            existing circumstances, might afford an easier and cheaper means of <lb/>
            accomplishing their ends than either war or diplomacy. Accordingly <lb/>
            they preferred a complaint against the Lacedæmonians for their per­ <lb/>
            fidious seizure of the Cadmea, and induced the Amphictyons to <lb/>
            impose on them a fine of five hundred talents. The exact time when <lb/>
            this sentence was passed does not appear, but it was probably soon <lb/>
            after the battle of Mantinea.2 The fine not having been paid was <lb/>
            doubled; but the Lacedæmonians took no notice either of one sen­ <lb/>
            tence. or the other. In the year B.C. 357 or 356, the Thebans preferred <lb/>
            a charge against the Phocians for having cultivated a portion of the <lb/>
            Cirrhæan plain, which had been condemned to lie waste ever since <lb/>
            the first Sacred War. It is probable enough, that both the Phocians and <lb/>
            the Amphissian Locrians had committed trespasses upon this land, <lb/>
            tilling or enclosing from the waste portions which were of no value <lb/>
            either to the temple or to the Pythian festival; and it might be <lb/>
            these very encroachments which formed the debateable land of <lb/>
            which Pausanias speaks.3 None but those in the neighbourhood <lb/>
            would care really about the matter; but it made a good pretext for <lb/>
            complaint against people who were obnoxious on other grounds, and <lb/>
            with such view was eagerly taken up by the Thebans, and perhaps <lb/>
            the Thessalians. A decree passed against the Phocians, condemning <lb/>
            them to a fine of many talents; which not being paid, the Hiero- <note type="footnote"> (1) Diodorus, xvi. 7. Æschines, contr. Ctesiph. 65, 67. Demosthenes, De Cher­ <lb/>

            mnemons brought the case again before the council, and demanded <lb/>
            judgment against them for their contumacy; stating that there were <lb/>
            others too whose penalties ought to be enforced, to wit, the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians, and that the defaulters merited public execration. <lb/>
            Judgment was passed, that the land of the Phocians should be con­ <lb/>
            secrated to Apollo.1 Diodorus, who always takes what he considered <lb/>
            the religious view of the question, says that the sentence of the <lb/>
            Ampbictyons was greatly approved by the Greeks. He seems to forget <lb/>
            that the Thebans, for having razed to the ground Platæa, Thespiæ, <lb/>
            and Orchomenus, were equally liable to Amphictyonic censure; and also <lb/>
            that the motives of the parties concerned in these proceedings were <lb/>
            not the purest in the world. In asserting that they were generally <lb/>
            sanctioned by public opinion, he most likely confounds the time <lb/>
            when the sentence was passed with a subsequent period, when the <lb/>
            proceedings of the Phocians at Delphi excited disapprobation even <lb/>
            among those who were not well inclined to their enemies.!</p>
          <p>While this sentence impended over the Phocians, and they were in <lb/>
            alarm lest it should be immediately put in force, Philomelus, a native <lb/>
            of Ledon, and a man of high reputation among his countrymen, <lb/>
            addressed them in a tone of encouragement, urging that it was <lb/>
            impossible to pay the fine on account of its magnitude, and that to <lb/>
            allow their land to be taken as forfeit would not only be cowardice on <lb/>
            their part, but absolute and certain ruin. He showed the injustice <lb/>
            of the sentence, and its disproportion to the alleged crime; and then <lb/>
            advised them to procure its reversal, which they might easily do, if <lb/>
            they would assert their ancient title to the possession of Delphi and <lb/>
            the presidency of the oracle; in support of which he cited the well- <lb/>
            known lines from the catalogue of the ships in Homer.3 If they <lb/>
            would only make him their general with full powers, he offered to <lb/>
            guarantee their success.4</p>
          <p>The Phocians, stimulated by their fears, elected Philomelus to be <lb/>
            their general, and invested him with absolute powers.5 He proceeded <note type="footnote"> (1) Diodorus, xvi. 23, 29. Justin. viii. 1, states the charge against the Phocians <lb/>
            to have been, that they had ravaged the Boeotian territory. If this be well founded, <lb/>
            it must have referred to the part they took in the campaigns of Agesilaus and Cleom­ <lb/>
            brotus; and this would lead us to suppose, that the charge was preferred soon after <lb/>
            the battle of Leuctra; for it would have been absurd to revive it at a later period, after <lb/>
            the Phocians had been admitted to the Theban alliance. But this was hardly the <lb/>
            kind of offence to be a fit subject for Amphictyonic cognisance. I could rather believe <lb/>
            the story cited from Duns by Athenaeus (xiii. 560), that an outrage committed by <lb/>
            some Phocian upon a Theban lady was the cause of the war. Pausanias (x. 2) says he <lb/>
            has not been able to discover, whether the fine was imposed on the Phocians for any real <lb/>
            offence, or whether it was owing to the malice of their old enemies, the Thessalians. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) Demosthenes (De Coron. 231) intimates distinctly, that the Athenians, though <lb/>

            immediately to Sparta, and revealed his plans in confidence to King <lb/>
            Archidamus; saying, that it was the interest of Sparta no less than <lb/>
            of his own country, to rescind the illegal decrees of the Amphic­ <lb/>
            tyons; that he had determined to seize upon Delphi for that purpose, <lb/>
            and the Spartans ought to make common cause with him. Archi­ <lb/>
            damns approved of his resolution; and declared that, although he <lb/>
            could not openly cooperate with him for the present, he would render <lb/>
            him secretly all the assistance in his power. He supplied him for <lb/>
            immediate exigencies with a loan of fifteen talents and some merce. <lb/>
            nary troops.1</p>
          <p>If Theopompus is to be believed, the Spartan king was induced <lb/>
            to espouse the Phocian cause by bribes given to himself and his queen, <lb/>
            Deimcha; and a similar charge was made against the Ephors and <lb/>
            senate. Their hostility to Thebes, and the identity of Spartan and <lb/>
            Phocian interests, are sufficient of themselves to account for the <lb/>
            side which they chose; though it is likely enough that some of the <lb/>
            Delphic money was afterwards distributed at Sparta, as it was <lb/>
            among the influential men of other states.2</p>
          <p>The subsidy furnished by Archidamus, together with an equal sum <lb/>
            advanced out of his own private purse, enabled the Phocian general to <lb/>
            raise a considerable body of mercenaries. With these and a thou­ <lb/>
            sand Phocian targeteers he marched suddenly upon Delphi, and took <lb/>
            possession of the temple; the Thracidæ, one of the five families con­ <lb/>
            nected with the oracle, who attempted to oppose him, he put to death, <lb/>
            and confiscated their property; then, seeing that this had excited <lb/>
            general alarm, he assured the Delphians, that, if they would keep quiet, <lb/>
            they had nothing to fear. a The news was however quickly carried <lb/>
            round. The nearest neighbours were the Amphissian Locrians, who <lb/>
            no sooner heard of the seizure of Delphi, than they marched against the <lb/>
            aggressor. A battle took place in the outskirts of the city; and the <lb/>
            Locrians, after losing a large number of men, were put to flight. Philo­ <lb/>
            melus, emboldened by his victory, effaced the pillars on which the Am­ <lb/>
            phictyonic decrees were inscribed, and destroyed every record of them; <lb/>
            at the same time he gave out, that he had no intention of plundering <lb/>
            the temple or committing any illegal outrage; his object was only to <lb/>
            rescind an unjust sentence against his countrymen, and to assert <lb/>
            their ancient right to be the administrators and guardians of the <lb/>
            sanctuary..</p>

            I <lb/>
            was held, and a resolution passed to take arms in the sacred cause.! <lb/>
            While they were yet considering in what way they should proceed to <lb/>
            punish the offenders, Philomelus was busy fortifying Delphi with <lb/>
            a wall, and making a general levy among all the Phocians who were fit <lb/>
            for military service. He gathered round him fresh bodies of merce­ <lb/>
            naries, by promising half as much again as the usual pay; and boldly <lb/>
            pitching his camp before the city, appeared to bid defiance to his <lb/>
            enemies. The number of his troops (reckoning only the regular in­ <lb/>
            fantry) was about five thousand. Seeing the advantage of bringing <lb/>
            them speedily to action and striking a blow before all his enemies were <lb/>
            united, and with the further object of enriching himself by plunder, he <lb/>
            invaded and ravaged the country of the Amphissian Locrians. In an <lb/>
            attack upon a strong fortress he received a check, and afterwards in <lb/>
            a skirmish with the Locrians lost twenty of his men. Having applied <lb/>
            by a herald for permission to bury them, he was refused, the Locrians <lb/>
            answering, that it was the universal custom of the Greeks to cast <lb/>
            away without sepulture the bodies of men guilty of sacrilege. In a <lb/>
            subsequent skirmish the Phocians were left masters of the field, and <lb/>
            the Locrians, being compelled to ask permission to bury their own <lb/>
            dead, were glad to make an exchange. Philomelus, not able to bring <lb/>
            the enemy to a general battle, continued for some time to ravage the <lb/>
            country, and then returned home laden with spoil.2</p>
          <p>His next proceeding was to obtain the sanction of the oracle for <lb/>
            his cause. He commanded the priestess to deliver her prophecy from <lb/>
            the tripod according to ancient custom. She demurred at first, say­ <lb/>
            ing that he sought to violate the ancient custom; but on his threaten­ <lb/>
            ing her, she mounted the tripod, and pronounced that it was lawful <lb/>
            for him to do what he pleased. This response, which he declared to <lb/>
            be perfectly satisfactory, he reduced to writing, and exposed to <lb/>
            public view in the city of Delphi; he called an assembly for the <lb/>
            special purpose of announcing it, and congratulated his friends on the <lb/>
            encouragement which Apollo had given them. A slight thing which <lb/>
            happened about the same time was hailed as a favourable omen. An <lb/>
            eagle, flying over the altar, snatched up some of the tame doves that <lb/>
            were kept in the temple;3 which was interpreted as a sign, that <lb/>
            Philomelus would be the master of Delphi. Elated now with hope, <lb/>
            yet impressed with the necessity of conciliating the Greeks, and <lb/>
            averting the suspicion which some of his acts were likely to inspire, <lb/>
            he despatched select envoys to the principal cities of Greece, not ex­ <lb/>
            cepting even Thebes, to justify and explain his conduct; in particular <lb/>
            to show, that, while he asserted the claims of his country to the <note type="footnote"> (1) Diodorus (xvi. 25) says, <foreign xml:lang="grc">παραχρη̃μα στρατιώτας ἀξέπεμψαν</foreign>. But of the desti­ <lb/>

            guardianship of the Delphic temple, he had no design to plunder it <lb/>
            of its treasures; that he was willing to render an account of them <lb/>
            to all the Greeks; and that any who chose might come and examine <lb/>
            the sacred offerings, to see that their weight and number were correct.1 <lb/>
            To those people who had ancient feuds with his countrymen, he urged <lb/>
            the injustice of making war upon a false pretext, to gratify private <lb/>
            enmity; praying that, if they would not assist him, they would at <lb/>
            least be neutral. At Thebes and in Locris these remonstrances pro­ <lb/>
            duced no effect, but were answered by a declaration of war. Athens, <lb/>
            Sparta, and some other cities concluded alliance with the Phocians, <lb/>
            and gave them promises of assistance.2 Such were the events of the <lb/>
            first year of the war, B. c. 355.</p>
          <p>To meet the exigencies of the ensuing campaign, Philomelus made <lb/>
            new levies of soldiers, and to provide pay for them, exacted heavy <lb/>
            contributions from the wealthy citizens of Delphi. Collecting all <lb/>
            his troops together, he reviewed them, and made an imposing show <lb/>
            of strength; but if he hoped to deter his enemies from attacking <lb/>
            him, he was quickly disappointed. The Locrians, eager to revenge <lb/>
            their former defeat, without waiting for any auxiliaries, advanced <lb/>
            against him, and gave battle at the- Phædriad cliffs near Delphi. <lb/>
            Philomelus was again victorious, killing great numbers of the enemy, <lb/>
            and taking a multitude of prisoners: the Locrians, seeing that they <lb/>
            were not a match for the Phocians by themselves, sent to Thebes for <lb/>
            succour. We have no explanation why the Thebans did not at an <lb/>
            earlier period enter actively into the war; but in this as in other <lb/>
            parts of their conduct we perceive a want of that vigorous energy, <lb/>
            which they displayed in the time of Epaminondas. It is possible <lb/>
            that they delayed commencing hostilities till Philomelus had put <lb/>
            himself more completely in the wrong; and they were anxious to <lb/>
            procure a solemn vote of the Amphictyons, appointing them to con. <lb/>
            duct a holy war as champions of the god. With such view apparently, <lb/>
            and to counteract the efforts of the Phocian agents, they despatched <lb/>
            embassies to the various Amphictyonic states, calling upon them to <note type="footnote"> (1) Grote, in his History of Greece, xi. 350, has the following note upon the sub­ <lb/>

            unite in 'the cause of religion against the Phocians. The majority <lb/>
            complied, including the Locrians, Dorians, Thessalians, Perrhæbians, <lb/>
            Magnetes, Dolopians, Athamanians, Phthiots, and Ænianians; while <lb/>
            Athens, Lacedæmon, and some other states of Peloponnesus, adhered <lb/>
            to the Phocian cause. It may be inferred from the words of Diodorus, <lb/>
            that a formal declaration of war was passed at a congress of Amphic­ <lb/>
            tyons (which must have been held at Thermopylæ); and severe <lb/>
            sentences were passed not only upon the whole Phocian people, as <lb/>
            impious and sacrilegious criminals, but specially upon Philomelus <lb/>
            and the most prominent leaders of his party, who were condemned <lb/>
            to heavy fines. It does not appear, however, that the Thebans were <lb/>
            chosen to command the united force of the league, nor that any <lb/>
            plan was agreed upon for carrying on the war with effect.1</p>
          <p>The remissness of his adversaries gave time to Philomelus for <lb/>
            preparation. Seeing the necessity of greatly augmenting his num­ <lb/>
            bers, and of providing pay for them by extraordinary means, he now <lb/>
            openly laid his hands upon the Delphic treasures, and giving notice <lb/>
            that the pay of his soldiers would be half as much again as before, <lb/>
            he invited the mercenaries, with whom Greece then abounded, to <lb/>
            enlist under his banners. No sooner were his intentions made pub­ <lb/>
            licly known, than a multitude of adventurers, chiefly men of despe­ <lb/>
            rate fortune and character, flocked from all quarters to his camp, <lb/>
            eager to share in the plunder that was promised them. Finding <lb/>
            himself at the head of a considerable army, he anticipated the <lb/>
            enemy's attack by a rapid march into Epicnemidian Locris, where <lb/>
            he met the native troops joined by a small detachment of the <lb/>
            Bœotians; and having defeated them in a cavalry action, fell suddenly <lb/>
            upon a body of six thousand Thessalians advancing from the north, <lb/>
            and defeated them separately on a cliff (forming one of the Locrian <lb/>
            range of hills) called Argolas. But now the main army of the <lb/>
            Bœotians, thirteen thousand strong, advanced into Locris, and pitch­ <lb/>
            ing their camp opposite to the Phocian general, offered him battle. <lb/>
            Philomelus was reinforced by fifteen hundred Achæans; yet, as his <lb/>
            whole army did not much exceed eleven thousand, he thought it more <lb/>
            prudent to decline a general engagement. The foraging parties <lb/>
            however met in frequent skirmishes; and the Bœotians, having taken <lb/>
            some prisoners, caused them to be led out in front of the camp and <lb/>
            executed as malefactors, declaring that such was the judgment pro­ <lb/>
            nounced on them by the Amphictyons. The soldiers of Philomelus, <lb/>
            enraged at this savage conduct, insisted that he should retaliate; and <lb/>
            exerting themselves to take alive as many as they possibly could of <lb/>
            the enemy, they soon put him in a condition to do so. Philomelus <lb/>
            without hesitation put all his prisoners to death. This led to a <lb/>
            mutual abandonment of a barbarous practice, which was not sanc­ <lb/>
            tioned by the general usages of Grecian warfare. While the armies <note type="footnote"> (1) Diodorus, xvi. 28, 29, 32 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="264"/>
            remained in this position, no action occurred worthy of notice; and <lb/>
            at length Philomelus found it necessary to retreat into his own <lb/>
            country. He was followed by the enemy, whom he drew into the <lb/>
            mountainous and woody regions of Parnassus, hoping to obtain <lb/>
            advantage over them by his better knowledge of the locality. After <lb/>
            some marching and counter-marching, he was surprised by the <lb/>
            Bœotians near the city of Neon, and compelled to fight a battle with <lb/>
            one division of his forces against greatly superior numbers. Here <lb/>
            his troops were totally routed; he himself fighting bravely to the <lb/>
            last was driven to the edge of a precipice, from which, rather than <lb/>
            be taken alive, he threw himself headlong down, and met the very <lb/>
            death to which sacrilegious criminals were doomed by Hellenic law; <lb/>
            a sign, as Diodorus thinks, that the vengeance of the gods had over­ <lb/>
            taken him. Onomarchus, his brother, succeeding to the command, <lb/>
            rallied the fugitives, and led them back to Delphi.</p>
          <p>It might have been expected, that the Thebans would have followed <lb/>
            up their victory, by marching instantly to the holy city, scattering <lb/>
            the remnant of their vanquished foes, and rescuing the temple from <lb/>
            further pillage. Instead of this, they relieved the beaten Phocians <lb/>
            from any immediate apprehension of danger, by retreating themselves <lb/>
            into Bœotia. The explanation which Diodorus gives of their con. <lb/>
            duct is, that they considered the main objects of the war were ac­ <lb/>
            complished by the death of Philomelus; that the Phocians, seeing <lb/>
            him, the author of their calamities, to have been signally punished <lb/>
            by gods and men, would repent of their folly and turn to wiser <lb/>
            counsels. If this were so, it is one among many proofs, that the <lb/>
            Thebans had among them at that time no able adviser. I am more <lb/>
            disposed however to take Thirlwall’s view, that the retreat of the <lb/>
            Thebans was owing to strategic causes, the victory of Neon not <lb/>
            having been so decisive as to encourage them to pursue the enemy, <lb/>
            much less to undertake a siege of Delphi.</p>
          <p>The proceedings in that city after the battle show what important <lb/>
            results might have been accomplished by the rapid advance of a vic­ <lb/>
            torious army. Among the national troops and counsellors of the <lb/>
            Phocians there was a moderate party, who were desirous of peace, <lb/>
            dreading the consequences of opposition to so large a body of the <lb/>
            Greeks, and seeing how feebly they had been supported by their pro­ <lb/>
            fessed allies. Some had religions scruples, and were shocked at a <lb/>
            state of things, under which they were as a nation excommunicated <lb/>
            from Hellenic society and brotherhood: others were jealous of the <lb/>
            despotic power exercised by the general, or disgusted with the licen­ <lb/>
            tiousness of his mercenary camp. Onomarchus, on the other hand, <lb/>
            felt that the only chance of honour and distinction for himself and <lb/>
            his family lay in the continuance of the war; his very safety depended <lb/>
            upon it, as he was personally implicated in the charges preferred by <note type="footnote"> (1) Diodorus, xvi. 30, 31. Pausanias, x. 2. The death of Philomelus occurred <lb/>
            a. c. 354. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="265"/>
            the Amphictyons, and sentenced by them to the penalties of sacrilege. <lb/>
            On his side were the more bold and unscrupulous part of the Phocians, <lb/>
            and the whole body of mercenaries, who saw their advantage in the <lb/>
            prospect of pay and plunder. An assembly or council of war was <lb/>
            convened, and Onomarchus in a powerful and well-prepared speech <lb/>
            urged the necessity of resisting the enemy, and persevering in the <lb/>
            manly course begun by Philomelus. His eloquence, backed by the <lb/>
            support of the army, carried the day; and he was elected to fill the <lb/>
            office of general with the same absolute powers which had been <lb/>
            conferred upon his predecessor. His first care was, to fill up the <lb/>
            places of the soldiers who had fallen in battle, to make new levies of <lb/>
            mercenaries, and provide himself with an immense quantity of arms <lb/>
            and military stores. The work of spoliation was now commenced <lb/>
            on a larger scale than before. Whatever donatives of brass and iron <lb/>
            manufacture he found in the temple, he converted into arms; the <lb/>
            gold and silver he melted down for coinage, employing it not only <lb/>
            for the maintenance of his own troops, but for distribution among <lb/>
            the leading statesmen of Athens, Sparta, and other cities in alliance <lb/>
            with him. Experience had shown that little was to be expected from <lb/>
            the voluntary exertions of these allies, occupied as they were by <lb/>
            their own affairs, or distracted by their own troubles. It was neces­ <lb/>
            sary to stimulate their zeal by some extraordinary means, and gold <lb/>
            was profusely lavished for this purpose. But Onomarchus did not <lb/>
            stop here. He employed the ample means of corruption which he <lb/>
            had at his command to purchase peace from his enemies; some of <lb/>
            whom he gained over to his side, others he persuaded to be neutral. <lb/>
            Among these were the Thessalians.1</p>
          <p>The feelings of pious men were further outraged, by seeing the <lb/>
            riches of the temple not only applied to purposes of war and adminis­ <lb/>
            tration, but lavished on amusement and vanity. Onomarchus was <lb/>
            vicious in his pleasures. Precious ornaments, hallowed by their <lb/>
            antiquity and the memories associated with them, were taken from <lb/>
            the custody of Apollo, to hang on the necks or encircle the brows of <lb/>
            his mistresses and favourites. Philomelus had occasionally been <lb/>
            generous in this way at the expense of the god; yet there were <lb/>
            bounds to his liberality, which the extravagance of his successor dis­ <lb/>
            regarded. Philomelus had been mild in his domestic government, <lb/>
            and gained a well-merited popularity, which had helped to secure the <lb/>
            succession to his brother. Onomarchus, irritable in his temper, and <lb/>
            intolerant of opposition, seized the principal Phocians who had either <lb/>
            resisted his election, or whom he considered to be forming a party <lb/>
            against him in the state, and condemned them to lose their lives and <lb/>
            property. With all this, he was not free from the superstition of the <lb/>
            age. He was encouraged by a dream, in which a colossal statue, one <lb/>
            of the ornaments of the temple, seemed to grow under his hands in <note type="footnote"> (1) Diodorus, XVI. 32,33, 57. Athenæus, XII. 532. As to the bribery at Sparta, <lb/>

            height and bulk; which portended, as he thought, an increase of <lb/>
            glory under his own generalship; whereas, in the historian's view, it <lb/>
            signified that he would be an instrument for increasing the penalties <lb/>
            to which his countrymen were doomed.'</p>
          <p>Having now raised by his exertions a numerous and well-appointed <lb/>
            army, he lost no time in making the best use of it. The Amphissian <lb/>
            Locrians, terrified by his approach, and isolated from their confe­ <lb/>
            derates, had no resource but in submission. Entering the territory <lb/>
            of the Dorians, who were equally remote from all assistance, he <lb/>
            ravaged and plundered it with impunity. He overran Epicnemidian <lb/>
            Locris, taking and occupying with a garrison the city of Thronium, <lb/>
            the inhabitants of which he sold into slavery.</p>
          <p>Whether it was at this time, as Grote thinks, or a little later that <lb/>
            he took Nicæa and Alponus, is not clear. Certain it is, that he was <lb/>
            shortly afterwards master of the pass of Thermopylae, the access <lb/>
            to which those fortresses. commanded. From the hills of Cnemis <lb/>
            he descended into Boeotia, approaching the north-western bank of <lb/>
            the Lake Copais, where stood the ruins of Orchomenus, once the <lb/>
            first of Bœotian cities. It had been destroyed by the Thebans, <lb/>
            who cherished a bitter hatred against the city for having sided with <lb/>
            Lacedæmon, and after the battle of Leuctra were only restrained <lb/>
            from wreaking their vengeance upon it by the entreaties of Epa­ <lb/>
            minondas; but in the year B. c. 364, having discovered a conspi­ <lb/>
            racy of the Orchomenian knights and certain of their own exiles to <lb/>
            overthrow the government, they seized the occasion, during the ab­ <lb/>
            sence of Epaminondas, to punish the crime of a few citizens by the <lb/>
            extirpation of the whole people, whom they massacred in cold blood, <lb/>
            selling the women and children for slaves.2 Onomarchus took <lb/>
            possession of the ruined city, intending to establish it as a fortress <lb/>
            and sallying place against the enemy. There may have been a village <lb/>
            population in Orchomenus at this time; but there is no doubt that he <lb/>
            left a garrison in it, and repaired the fortifications; for it continued <lb/>
            to be occupied by the Phocians till the end of the war. He next laid <lb/>
            siege to Chæronea; but the Thebans coming to its relief, and his army <lb/>
            being weakened by the garrisons which he had detached, he was driven <lb/>
            with some loss from the walls of that city, and returned into Phocis.3</p>
          <p>The inaction of the Thebans at this period is attributable to <lb/>
            several causes; chiefly to the disunion sown among their allies by <lb/>
            the craft of their opponent, and the great advantage which he bad <lb/>
            over them in recruiting his military resources. They had vainly <lb/>
            imagined that they could maintain an army at their own cost, which <lb/>
            would overcome any mercenary force provided by the pillage of <lb/>
            Delphi, and they had found their mistake.4 The want of money <note type="footnote"> (1) Diodorus, xvi..33, 64. Athenæus, xiii. 605. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) Diodorus, xv. 57, 79.

            now compelled them to send five thousand men under Pammenes to <lb/>
            assist the satrap Artabazus, who had revolted against the Persian <lb/>
            king.1 But such a number could ill be spared from a war, in which <lb/>
            they had to contend against a power growing every day more for­ <lb/>
            midable. Onomarchus, in the year B.C. 353, commanded the largest <lb/>
            standing army in Greece, and was seemingly supported by the <lb/>
            strongest alliances. There was but one man able to cope with him, <lb/>
            and that was Philip of Macedon; with whom a series of events, <lb/>
            which must now be adverted to, brought him into conflict.</p>
          <p>Alexander of Pheræ, after a reign of eleven years, in which he had <lb/>
            shown some vigour and aptitude for command, mingled with the <lb/>
            most inhuman and savage ferocity, was murdered in his bed by <lb/>
            the contrivance of his wife Thebe, assisted by her brothers Tisiphonua <lb/>
            and Lycophron.2 Tisiphonus, either alone or jointly with his brother, <lb/>
            was raised to the supreme power, and having delivered their country <lb/>
            from an odious tyrant, they were at first highly popular, but in course <lb/>
            of time, as they became despotic, and rested their support upon <lb/>
            the mercenary troops, they excited an opposition, which could only <lb/>
            be put down by measures of violence. Tisiphonus survived but a few <lb/>
            years, and at the time to which we are drawing attention Lycophron <lb/>
            had the sole sway. When Onomarchus opened his negotiations in <lb/>
            Thessaly, Lycophron joined alliance with him. Common sympathies <lb/>
            attracted these two potentates to each other; and it is likely enough <lb/>
            that they entered into a compact for mutual support in their schemes <lb/>
            of ambition. Lycophron recommenced that system of encroachment <lb/>
            upon the Thessalian body, which had caused them in Alexander's <lb/>
            reign to invite foreign assistance. • The exact time when dissensions <lb/>
            broke out between them and the ruler of Pheræ cannot, in the absence <lb/>
            of historical information, be clearly ascertained. There is evidence <lb/>
            to warrant the conjecture, that he had enlarged his dominions at <lb/>
            their expense, and got possession of some of their fortresses, as early <lb/>
            as the year 355 B.C., and that the Thessalians were then in a <lb/>
            distressed and impoverished condition: but it does not appear that <lb/>
            any foreign aid was called in before the year 353 B. c. It was then <lb/>
            useless to apply to Thebes, cut off as she was from communication <lb/>
            with the north, and scarcely able to defend herself at home. The <lb/>
            Aleuads therefore turned their eyes to Philip of Macedon, who, still <lb/>
            carrying on war against Athens and her dependencies, had advanced to <lb/>
            besiege Methone, the last remaining possession of the Athenians on <lb/>
            the Macedonian coast.3 <note type="footnote"> (1) Diodorus, xvi. 34. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) Xenophon, Hellen. vi. c. 4. as. 35—37. Plutarch, in Vit. Pelopid. 35. Diodorus, <lb/>

          <p>Methone fell after a long siege: and Philip, at the invitation to <lb/>
            the Aleuads, marched into Thessaly. The course of his operations <lb/>
            is not clear. It is probable that one of the earliest was against Pagasæ, <lb/>
            which he would be anxious to take before the Athenians could send <lb/>
            relief to it by sea. They did send a fleet, which, as usual, arrived <lb/>
            too late, and Pagasæ fell into his hands.1 Lycophron meanwhile had <lb/>
            applied for succour to the Phocian general, who sent seven thousand <lb/>
            men under the command of his brother Phayllus ; but he was beaten <lb/>
            by Philip, and driven back from Thessaly; upon which Onomarchus, <lb/>
            seeing the great importance of repelling so dangerous an adversary, <lb/>
            mustered all his forces together, and hastened in person to the scene <lb/>
            of action. Twice did these two generals, the ablest then in Greece, <lb/>
            encounter each other in battle; and twice was Philip worsted. In <lb/>
            the first engagement Onomarchus, not trusting entirely to superior <lb/>
            numbers, resorted to a stratagem difficult and dangerous to practise <lb/>
            except with experienced troops. He had occupied some rising ground <lb/>
            under a semicircular ridge of hills. On the high cliffs which flanked <lb/>
            him on either side he placed a heap of loose rocks and a body of men <lb/>
            in concealment, then descended into the plain to meet the enemy. <lb/>
            They instantly attacked him, the light troops discharging their mis­ <lb/>
            siles, and he by a pretended flight drew them after him into the <lb/>
            concavity of the hills. As the Macedonians rushed tumultuously <lb/>
            forward, their progress was suddenly arrested by crushing masses of <lb/>
            rock hurled down among them from the cliffs: at that moment <lb/>
            Onomarchus gave the signal, and the Phocians charging their dis­ <lb/>
            ordered ranks drove them back with slaughter to their camp. In the <lb/>
            midst of the flight Philip lost not his presence of mind, but coolly <lb/>
            observed to those about him, that he was retiring like a battering <lb/>
            ram, only to be more terrible in the reaction.2 Notwithstanding this <lb/>
            vaunt, he was again defeated, and the second time so severely, that <lb/>

            some mistake, for he mentions the siege of Methone twice, the right place being <lb/>

            surrendered. Again, had there been a siege of Pagasæ at that time, there was an <lb/>

            him, or breaking into open mutiny. Using all his powers of per­ <lb/>
            suasion to keep the discouraged remnant in obedience, he led them <lb/>
            back to his own kingdom. He was not however pursued, events <lb/>
            having happened which required the presence of Onomarchus in <lb/>
            Bœotia.1</p>
          <p>The diversion made by Philip in Thessaly had encouraged the <lb/>
            Thebans again to try the fortune of war. They had taken the field, <lb/>
            with the intention perhaps of recovering Orchomenus ; but whatever <lb/>
            their plans were, they were disconcerted by the rapidity of the <lb/>
            Phocian general, who with his victorious army appearing suddenly <lb/>
            in Bœotia overcame them in battle, and then besieged and took <lb/>
            Coronea. This city was near the south-western shore of Lake <lb/>
            Copais, and about twenty miles from Thebes. The loss of such <lb/>
            a place must have been a great blow-to the Thebans, and proves how <lb/>
            incapable they were at this time to defend themselves against the <lb/>
            superior force of the enemy. It is not unlikely, the population of <lb/>
            Coronea were unfriendly to Thebes, and surrendered their city <lb/>
            without much reluctance: for it remained in possession of the Pho­ <lb/>
            cians until the end of the war, and met then with the same severe <lb/>
            punishment which was inflicted upon Orchomenus.2 The campaign <lb/>
            might further have been prolonged, with still more disastrous issues <lb/>
            to the Thebans; but, fortunately for them, Onomarchus was recalled <lb/>
            by the alarming intelligence, that Philip had again raised his standard <lb/>
            in Thessaly.3</p>
          <p>That indefatigable prince, having repaired the strength and disci­ <lb/>
            pline of his army in Macedonia, returned with the resolute deter­ <lb/>
            mination to accomplish his original purpose. Unless he could <lb/>
            retrieve his honour and establish his ascendency in Thessaly, it was <lb/>
            all over with ulterior projects of empire. He therefore strenuously <lb/>
            exerted himself to levy troops among his allies. To stimulate their <lb/>
            zeal, he proclaimed that he was come not only to deliver them from <lb/>
            the Pheræan tyranny, but to subdue the sacrilegious Phocians, and <lb/>
            restore to the Amphictyons their Pylæan synod.4 The Aleuads <lb/>
            seconded his efforts, and in a short time his army, reinforced by the <lb/>
            Thessalians, amounted to above twenty thousand foot and three <lb/>
            thousand horse. He ordered his men to wear wreaths of laurel, as <lb/>
            soldiers in the cause of Apollo;6 and having raised their ardour <lb/>
            and courage to the highest pitch, he led them against the enemy. <lb/>
            Onomarchus had come promptly to the aid of Lycophron, and was <lb/>
            already in the Pheræan territory with a force of twenty thousand <lb/>
            foot and four hundred horse. The two armies met on the shore of <lb/>
            the Pagasæan gulf, not far from Pagasæ, and within sight of an <note type="footnote"> (1) Diodorus, xvi. 35. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) Demosthenes, De Pace, 62. De Fals.

            Athenian squadron under Chares, which was cruising off the coast. <lb/>
            It was now to be decided, whether Philip or Onomarchus should be <lb/>
            the future lord of Thessaly, and perhaps of Greece. The battle was <lb/>
            long and obstinate, but the fortune of Philip prevailed, owing chiefly <lb/>
            to the numbers and valour of his Thessalian cavalry. The Phocians, <lb/>
            broken on all sides, fled to the beach; many plunging into the <lb/>
            waves, in the vain attempt to swim to the Athenian ships, were <lb/>
            either drowned or cut to pieces by pursuing horsemen. Among <lb/>
            these was Onomarchus himself. Six thousand of his troops were <lb/>
            slain; three thousand prisoners were drowned in the sea as criminals <lb/>
            by the command of the conqueror. The body of Onomarchus was <lb/>
            nailed to a cross.1 Thus perished, in the fourth year of the Sacred <lb/>
            war, the only general who had ability enough to compete with the <lb/>
            king of Macedon.2</p>
          <p>Phayllus, succeeding to the command, applied himself without <lb/>
            delay to repair the dreadful loss which his country had sustained, <lb/>
            and to put her in a posture of defence. The flower of the Phocian <lb/>
            army had been destroyed. Scarce a third part of the force which <lb/>
            had marched into Thessaly could have returned to their standards. <lb/>
            To obtain speedy succour was indispensable. Phocis might be <lb/>
            attacked by all her enemies at once. The Macedonians might pene­ <lb/>
            trate the straits of Thermopylae, while the Thebans and Locrians <lb/>
            invaded the eastern frontier. Phayllus, to recruit his army, could <lb/>
            employ the same means which his predecessors had done, and those <lb/>
            he did not neglect: but for new levies of soldiers some time would be <lb/>
            required, and every moment was of importance. He therefore sent <lb/>
            pressing messages to Athens, to Sparta, and to his other allies, represent­ <lb/>
            ing the urgency of the peril, and imploring immediate succour.3</p>
          <p>The Athenians in the beginning of the war, not withstanding their <lb/>
            treaty of alliance with the Phocians, had lent them no military aid. <lb/>
            They had been themselves impoverished and weakened by the Social <lb/>
            War,4 and were still engaged in a harassing contest with Macedonia. <lb/>
            Their interest in the Phocian quarrel was remote; and that any <lb/>
            danger to the liberty of Greece was to be apprehended from it, was <note type="footnote"> (1) Diodorus, xvi. 35. Pausanias, x. 2, states that Onomarchus was killed by his <lb/>
            own soldiers, attributing the defeat to his cowardice and incapacity. As to this, and <lb/>
            as to the punishment of criminals by drowning, see Wesseling's notes on the passage <lb/>
            in Diodorus. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) The ability of Onomarchus is sufficiently proved by his acts. The loss of the <lb/>
            battle is attributed by Diodorus to his inferiority in cavalry. It would seem, that he <lb/>
            had acquired experience as a commander in the Leuctric war. Polyænus (ii. 38) <lb/>
            relates a stratagem of his, which must have occurred at that period. The Thebans, <lb/>
            under Pelopidas, were besieging Elatea. Onomarchus opened the gates of the city, <lb/>
            brought out the old men, women, and children, and in front of them drew up the <lb/>
            whole force of the heavy-armed. Pelopidas, fearing to drive the Phocians to despair, <lb/>
            withdrew his army.-This reminds one of the old tale of Phocian desperation, <lb/>
            already cited from Pausanias (ante, p. 234). </note><note type="footnote"> (3) Diodorus, xvi. 36. </note><note type="footnote"> (4) Isocrates, De Pace, 163. This oration was composed at the close of the Social <lb/>

             <pb n="271"/>
            a thing which the most acute politician could not have dreamed of. <lb/>
            It appeared in a short time, that the Phocians, so far from needing <lb/>
            foreign assistance, were more than a match for their adversaries. <lb/>
            We may be surprised that after the successes of Onomarchus, when <lb/>
            the Thebans were so enfeebled as not to be able to defend their own <lb/>
            territory, the Athenians should not have taken advantage of the <lb/>
            occasion to attempt the recovery of Oropus. This may serve to <lb/>
            show both the military weakness of Athens, and the supineness of <lb/>
            her people. The siege of Pagasæ, so soon following the capture of <lb/>
            Methone, alarmed them a little on their own account, and they sent <lb/>
            a fleet to relieve it, which, as already mentioned, arrived too late. <lb/>
            Now however, when Philip, having destroyed the army of Onomar­ <lb/>
            chus, was ready to march with an overpowering force to Thermopylae, <lb/>
            he magnitude of the crisis became apparent; and it needed not the <lb/>
            urgent appeal of Phayllus to convince the Athenians, that they <lb/>
            themselves were deeply concerned in checking Philip's further pro­ <lb/>
            gress. Should he succeed in passing the barrier of southern Greece, <lb/>
            the road was open not merely to Phocis but to Athens. Their own <lb/>
            sailors, eye-witnesses of the battle, must have brought them the <lb/>
            earliest intelligence. From the Phocian envoys they would learn, <lb/>
            that Phayllus was unable to hold the pass unassisted. Roused at <lb/>
            once from their lethargy, the Athenians voted the required succours, <lb/>
            and shipped them off with the utmost expedition for the straits of <lb/>
            Thermopylae. The land force consisted of five thousand infantry and <lb/>
            four hundred horse, commanded by Nausicles. These, properly sup­ <lb/>
            ported by the Phocians, would be sufficient to guard the pass, so <lb/>
            long as the fleet, keeping command of the sea, prevented Philip <lb/>
            landing troops in their rear. Succours came also from Peloponnesus; <lb/>
            a thousand Lacedæmonians, and two thousand Achæans.1</p>
          <p>Philip immediately after his victory proceeded to the reduction of <lb/>
            Pherme. This was expected of him by the Thessalians, as the prime <lb/>
            object of the expedition. Pheræ, garrisoned by the troops of Lyco­ <lb/>
            phron, would be capable of holding out for some time; and it might <lb/>
            be policy in the tyrant to make some show of vigorous defence, if it <lb/>
            were merely for the sake of obtaining better terms. There could be <lb/>
            no chance for him however of ultimate success, cut off as he was <lb/>
            from all hope of assistance: he therefore capitulated, receiving per­ <lb/>
            mission for himself and his brother Pitholaus to retire with their <lb/>
            mercenaries from Thessaly. Two thousand soldiers were carried <lb/>
            over by them to the Phocians. Pherme was surrendered to Philip, <lb/>
            who abolished the dynasty to which it had so long been subject, and <lb/>
            established a free or popular government. After this he marched to <lb/>
            Thermopylae; but finding on his arrival that it was strongly guarded <note type="footnote"> (1) Diodorus, xvi. 37. The cost of the Athenian armament (according to Demo­ <lb/>
            sthenes, De Pals. Leg. 367) was more than two hundred talents, reckoning the pri­ <lb/>
            vate outlay of individuals as well as the public. We cannot doubt however that the <lb/>
            Athenians received money from Phayllus. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="272"/>
            by Athenian troops, he retreated without making any attempt to <lb/>
            force the pass. Thus did the Athenians by a prudent and timely <lb/>
            effort (more than once made the subject of eulogy by Demosthenes, <lb/>
            and cited by him as an example for imitation), avert from themselves <lb/>
            apparently a very serious danger.1</p>
          <p>Thirlwall, in his History of Greece, expresses a doubt whether the <lb/>
            retreat of Philip from Thermopylae was owing to any fear of the <lb/>
            Athenians; suggesting that perhaps he was not desirous of termi­ <lb/>
            nating the war so soon; had this been so, he would have followed <lb/>
            up his victory more rapidly: it was to his advantage that the Sacred <lb/>
            War, which was wasting the strength of the Greeks, should be kept <lb/>
            up some time longer; he advanced perhaps at the request of. the <lb/>
            Thessalians, and was glad to find a pretext for retiring from Ther­ <lb/>
            mopylæ.2 There are, as it appears to me, very fair grounds for the <lb/>
            suspicion of the learned historian; though I am less inclined to con­ <lb/>
            sider that Philip could have forced the pass against the Athenians, <lb/>
            than that he purposely delayed his own advance, deeming it prema­ <lb/>
            ture at that moment to carry his arms southward. The motives of <lb/>
            his conduct are to be looked for in the affairs of Thessaly, and in his <lb/>
            relations with the people of that country.</p>
          <p>The proceedings or Philip in Thessal, are but imperfectly known <lb/>
            to us. That he ultimately acquired such a preponderance in that <lb/>
            country as to be a sort of Tagus, exercising both a military and <lb/>
            a political authority, is certain: the steps by which he arrived at that <lb/>
            power are not so clearly revealed. On the one hand, we learn from <lb/>
            Diodorus, that Philip, by his generous services to the Thessalians in <lb/>
            putting down the tyrants and restoring the freedom of their cities, <lb/>
            secured their grateful cooperation in his own wars.3 Theopompus <lb/>
            attributes much of the popularity of Philip to his good companion­ <lb/>
            ship. Knowing (he says) that the Thessalians were addicted to <lb/>
            intemperance and debauchery, he followed the bent of their humour, <lb/>
            which indeed was quite natural to him, as he was himself a hard <lb/>
            drinker, fond of loose pleasures, coarse wit, and buffoonery; he there­ <lb/>
            fore lived among them freely, and by thus making himself agreeable, <lb/>
            he attached them to him more strongly than by his profuse liberality.4 <lb/>
            Isocrates, writing at the end of the Sacred War, tells us that the <lb/>
            Thessalians had become so attached to Philip as to put more conn­ <lb/>
            dence in him than in their own countrymen :5 Demosthenes, having <lb/>
            reference to the issue of that war, says they regarded him as a <lb/>

              war, and followed him to Chæronea; and their ambassadors supported <lb/>
              the Macedonian at Thebes against Demosthenes.1 On the other <lb/>
              hand, we are told by Justin, that Philip after the victory of Pagasæ <lb/>
              requited his Thessalian allies with the most atrocious perfidy; that <lb/>
              he took hostile possession of the very cities which had furnished him <lb/>
              with auxiliaries; that he sold their women and children by public <lb/>
              auction, and spared not even the temples or the houses in which he <lb/>
              had been hospitably entertained.2 This statement, which may be <lb/>
              regarded as an exaggeration, coincides in some measure with an <lb/>
              anecdote of Polyænus, who relates, that Philip came to Larissa to <lb/>
              destroy the houses of the Aleuads; that he sought by a pretended <lb/>
              sickness to entice them to visit him, and then to seize their persons; <lb/>
              and that the plot failed by the discovery of one Bcescus:3 some <lb/>
              additional confirmation is afforded by another passage of the same <lb/>
              author, in which he gives an account of Philip's general policy towards <lb/>
              the Thessalians; stating, that he contrived a means to subdue them <lb/>
              without making any open war; that, finding they were divided among <lb/>
              themselves and the different cities continually quarrelling,-for ex­ <lb/>
              ample, Pelinna with Pharsalus, Larissa with Pheræ,—he interfered <lb/>
              from time to time on behalf of those who solicited his aid, but when <lb/>
              he overcame their adversaries, he never pursued them to destruction, <lb/>
              nor deprived them of their arms or fortifications; his plan was always <lb/>
              to take the part of the weak against the strong, to support the <lb/>
              lower against the higher classes, and to encourage the demagogues : <lb/>
              by such arts he got the dominion of all Thessaly.4 Light is thrown <lb/>
              on this by the war which undoubtedly broke out between Pharsalus <lb/>
              and Halus, B. c. 347—346, in which Philip espoused the cause of the <lb/>
              Pbarsalians, and gave them the city after its captured And it <lb/>
              appears also, from divers passages of Demosthenes, that some of <lb/>
              Philip's acts were unpopular among the Thessalians, or at least <lb/>
              excited murmurs and complaints; for instance, his garrisoning of <lb/>
              their towns, and his appropriation of their public revenues; that <lb/>
              during the first few years of his connexion with them he had some <lb/>
              little difficulty in keeping them under his command, and resorted <lb/>
              occasionally to harsh measures; and that at last he divided the <lb/>
              country into tetrarchies, placing his own creatures in the chief <lb/>
              towns, to ensure their dependence on himself.6</p>

              and circumstances to which they have reference, and make due <lb/>
              allowance for high colouring and exaggeration, we may gather, not <lb/>
              indeed an exact series of historical events, but a probable view of <lb/>
              the course of things.</p>
          <p>Philip, when he entered Thessaly, never meant to put down the <lb/>
            tyrants of Pheræ and then quietly go away; nor to set up the <lb/>
            Aleuads or any other aristocratical family in the place which that <lb/>
            dynasty had usurped. He intended to conquer Thessaly for himself <lb/>
            and to use it as an instrument for ulterior purposes. But such <lb/>
            conquest was not achieved by the defeat of Onomarchus, nor yet by <lb/>
            the capture of Pherme and Pagasæ. It was not even certain that, if <lb/>
            he advanced into Phocis and put an end to the Sacred War, the <lb/>
            Thessalians would afterwards follow him into Attica, or assist him <lb/>
            in any other aggressive movement of his own.1 There was not much <lb/>
            reliance to be placed on the friendship or gratitude of that peopled <lb/>
            It was necessary to bring them entirely under his rule, before he <lb/>
            made any attempt against the Greeks south of Thermopylae. How <lb/>
            was this to be accomplished P Partly by conciliation and persuasion, <lb/>
            partly by coercion and force. He must make the Thessalians under­ <lb/>
            stand that Macedonian protection was indispensable to them. With <lb/>
            such view it was good policy to let the Phocians gather new strength; <lb/>
            and it was better also to let Lycophron and Pitholaus retire with <lb/>
            their adherents to a place of safety, than entirely to uproot the <lb/>
            regnant house and remove all fear of their return. He knew again, <lb/>
            that the same nobles who had invited him to expel the tyrant would <lb/>
            be dissatisfied with his own assumption of power, though to the <lb/>
            mass of the people it might not be so unacceptable. He therefore <lb/>
            made it his business to court favour with the less wealthy classes, <lb/>
            even with the Penestæ,8 who formed part of the army; and strove <lb/>
            to elevate them at the expense of the nobility. The expression of <lb/>
            Diodorus, that Philip restored freedom to Pherme, may be literally <lb/>
            true ;4 and he may have established in that city a species of demo­ <lb/>
            cracy. The Aleuads, who expected that Pherme would be given up <lb/>
            either to themselves or to parties in connexion with them, were <lb/>
            indignant at Philip's conduct; and gave utterance to their resentment <lb/>
            in complaints and threats, the more loud and vehement, as they were <lb/>
            able with some justice to urge, that, while he was meddling with <lb/>
            the internal affairs of Thessaly, he was neglecting his engagement to <lb/>
            prosecute the Phocian war. A party was formed against Philip, <note type="footnote"> (1) Demosthenes, De Pace, 60. De Coron. 276. De Fals. Leg. 444. ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Εστασίαζε μὲν <lb/>

            and it became necessary for him either to intimidate his opponents, <lb/>
            or to destroy their power and influence. Strong measures were <lb/>
            immediately adopted, such as those indicated by Justin and Polyænus. <lb/>
            Larissa was the stronghold of the Aleuads; and Philip, while he <lb/>
            insulted and degraded the members of that ancient house, would <lb/>
            take care not to leave so important a city under their control. Of <lb/>
            the manner in which he proceeded to foment the divisions among <lb/>
            the different cities of Thessaly, we have no further particulars than <lb/>
            those which have been already stated. His operations at Pagasæ <lb/>
            must have been among the earliest at this period. He there took <lb/>
            possession of the shipping and naval stores, and speedily turned <lb/>
            them to account against the Athenians, sending out cruisers to <lb/>
            plunder their allies and seize the merchant vessels in the Ægæan. <lb/>
            A Macedonian squadron made a descent on Lemnos and Imbrus, and <lb/>
            took some Athenian citizens prisoners: another made a valuable <lb/>
            prize of some merchantmen off the southern coast of Eubœa, and <lb/>
            afterwards entered the bay of Marathon and carried off the sacred <lb/>
            galley. The Athenians now discovered that not only their distant <lb/>
            possessions, but those near home, were in danger. Philip had for <lb/>
            seven or eight years been attacking them in Macedonia and Thrace; <lb/>
            now he was threatening even Attica itself. Demosthenes, in an <lb/>
            assembly held at the close of the year 352 B.C., delivered his first <lb/>
            Philippic, in which he specially notices these piratical excursions of <lb/>
            Philip, and the damage which they had done to Athens.1 He makes <lb/>
            however no allusion to the place in which such expeditions were pre­ <lb/>
            pared ; and it is likely enough, that the proceedings of Philip in <lb/>
            Thessaly were at this time wholly unknown to him. One of the <lb/>
            advantages resulting to Philip from his occupation of the gulf of <lb/>
            Pagasæ was, that it excluded the Athenians from communication <lb/>
            with Thessaly by sea, while it enabled him to carry on his intrigues <lb/>
            in Eubcea, and to menace the neighbouring islands, Sciathus, Halon­ <lb/>
            nesus, and Peparethus.2 He also gathered a considerable revenue <lb/>
            from the customs and harbour-dues of Pagasæ, which he took into <lb/>
            his own hands under the pretence at first of reimbursing himself for <lb/>
            the expenses of the war, and afterwards of maintaining a sufficient <lb/>
            war establishment for the defence of the country. To secure these <lb/>
            advantages to himself, he kept the city strongly fortified, and occu­ <lb/>
            pied it with a Macedonian garrison. Having settled the affairs of <lb/>
            the Pheræan kingdom, he turned his arms against the Magnetos and <lb/>
            Perrhsebians.3 Those tribes had perhaps asserted their independence <note type="footnote"> (1) Demosthenes, Philipp. i. 49, 50. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) Strabo, ix. 436, 437. Demosthenes recommends these islands as winter quar­ <lb/>
            ters for the standing force which he proposed to establish for the annoyance of <lb/>
            Philip's coast. (Philipp. i. 49.) The importance which Philip attached to this posi­ <lb/>
            tion partly appears from the complaints in his letter. (Epist. Philipp, 159.) Compare <lb/>

              of the Thessalians, and refused to lend any assistance in the war <lb/>
              against Lycophron. Philip subdued them under the pretence of <lb/>
              augmenting the security of Thessaly, but in reality for the purpose <lb/>
              of strengthening his own dominion. The city of Magnesia, which he <lb/>
              fortified and kept in his own possession, was conveniently situated <lb/>
              on the Ægæan coast above the bay of Pagasæ.1 The Perrhæbians <lb/>
              commanded the passes of Mount Olympus, and by their conquest an <lb/>
              entrance to Thessaly was secured.2 These proceedings occupied <lb/>
              Philip until the autumn of the year B.C. 352, when he entered upon <lb/>
              a Thracian expedition, which kept him actively engaged for about <lb/>
              a twelvemonth; at the end of which time he fell ill, and was obliged <lb/>
              to return to his own kingdom.3 During his absence the aristocratical <lb/>
              parties began again to make head in Thessaly, and to intrigue against <lb/>
              him. Exciting topics easily presented themselves-his retention <lb/>
              of their cities and revenues, his arbitrary innovations, and his inten­ <lb/>
              tion to set himself up as a tyrant (no better than those of Pheræ) <lb/>
              under the mask of a protector. Philip's partisans on the other hand <lb/>
              were not idle: they reminded the people of his past services, and <lb/>
              promised that he would take the earliest opportunity of chastising <lb/>
              the Phocians and restoring the Pylæan congress. Notwithstanding <lb/>
              all their efforts however, the opposite party obtained a partial success, <lb/>
              and adverse votes were passed in some of the cities, asserting their <lb/>
              own independence, calling upon Philip to abandon his fortification of <lb/>
              Magnesia, to make restitution of Pagasæ, and the like.4 Things had <lb/>
              taken such a turn, that the presence of Philip was required to over­ <lb/>
              awe the malcontents, and restore confidence to his party. It hap­ <lb/>
              pened fortunately for him at this crisis, that an attempt was made <lb/>
              by the exiled Pitholaus to recover his power in Pherme. Philip's <lb/>
              adherents seized upon this as a pretext for calling him into the <lb/>
              country. Accordingly about the middle of the year B.O. 350 he re­ <lb/>
              entered Thessaly: his mere approach was sufficient to frighten away the <lb/>
              intruder; and all that remained for him to do was, by liberal promises <lb/>
              and politic measures to consolidate his power and popularity.5 He <note type="footnote"> (1) Grote thinks there was no city called Magnesia, but that this name denotes <lb/>
              the region only. (History of Greece, xi. p. 425, note 3.) It looks as if a city ware <lb/>

              was then preparing for the Olynthian war, on the issue of which <lb/>
              hung such important consequences; and he was glad to enlist under <lb/>
              his standard the horsemen of Thessaly. Many of them he kept per­ <lb/>

              their commander, they answered the double purpose of strengthening <lb/>
              his army and securing his ascendency in their native land.1</p>

          <p>Phayllus, relieved by his allies from the pressure of immediate <lb/>
            danger, spared neither trouble nor expense to reestablish his own <lb/>
            military force. Drawing from the resources of the temple no less <lb/>
            profusely than Onomarchus had done, he now melted down the golden <lb/>
            ingots of Croesus, a hundred and seventeen in number, and weighing <lb/>
            two talents each or nearly; also the female statue and golden lion, <lb/>
            and three hundred and sixty golden beakers, which together weighed <lb/>
            thirty talents. All these were converted into coin.2 The produce <lb/>
            enabled him to make speedy levies of troops, and he was soon strong <lb/>
            enough to take the field in Boeotia. He was there defeated in a severe <lb/>
            engagement with the Thebans near Orchomenus, in another on the <lb/>
            banks of the Cephisus, and in a third by Coronea. It is not unlikely <lb/>
            that the Thebans had advanced to besiege one or both of these cities, <lb/>
            and that Phayllus had come to their relief. His army, beaten in open <lb/>
            field, took refuge within the walls, and the Thebans, unable to follow <lb/>
            up their victory, retired. Shortly afterwards Phayllus made an <lb/>
            incursion into Epicnemidian Locris, and reduced all the cities into <lb/>
            his power, except Aryca or Naryx, from which, after it had been <lb/>
            betrayed to him in the night time, he was driven out again with <lb/>
            some loss. Leaving a force before it to carry on the siege, he re­ <lb/>
            treated into Phocis, but, while he was encamped near Abæ, he was <lb/>
            surprised by the Thebans, who attacked him in the night and killed <lb/>
            a considerable number of his troops. Elated with this success, they <lb/>
            advanced further into the Phocian territory, ravaged a large tract of <lb/>

              as general-in-chief by Phalæcus, son of his brother Onomarchus, <lb/>
              who, being a minor, was put under the guardianship of Mnaseas, <lb/>
              a friend of the family.1</p>
          <p>During these last occurrences both the Thebans and the Phocians <lb/>
            sent succours to their respective allies in Peloponnesus, where the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians had commenced war against Megalopolis and Mes­ <lb/>
            sene. The details of this I have given in another appendix.</p>
          <p>The war was renewed by Mnaseas in Bceotia; but he having been <lb/>
            killed in a night-combat by the Thebans, Phalæcus himself took the <lb/>
            command. A cavalry action occurred near Chæronea, in which the <lb/>
            Phocians were worsted; yet still they kept the field in the enemy's <lb/>
            country, and at one time had succeeded in taking Chæronea, but <lb/>
            were again driven out by the Thebans, who now, reinforced by their <lb/>
            troops returned from Peloponnesus, resolved on attempting a diver­ <lb/>
            sion, by which, if they could not free their own country from the <lb/>
            presence of hostile garrisons, they would at least retaliate the <lb/>
            miseries of war upon their opponents. Accordingly they invaded <lb/>
            Phocis, and meeting with no resistance, laid waste the greater part <lb/>
            of it with fire and sword. One of the smaller towns they captured, <lb/>
            and returned laden with spoil into Bceotia.2</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding all the efforts of the Thebans, they were unable <lb/>
            to dislodge their enemies from the Bœotian fortresses, from which <lb/>
            they made continual incursions, and threatened them with further <lb/>
            conquest. It is probable that the mercenaries were employed in this <lb/>
            foreign service, while the native Phocians remained to defend their <lb/>
            homes. The Theban troops, consisting chiefly of heavy-armed <lb/>
            infantry, were superior in close combat to the mercenaries, who <lb/>
            were for the most part peltastæ; this may account for the number <lb/>
            of Theban victories in the field: but the mercenaries were quicker <lb/>
            in their movements, easily rallied, and more efficient in desultory <lb/>
            fighting. Besides, the Theban army being composed of citizens, <lb/>
            their losses were not easily repaired ; while the Phocian general was <lb/>
            continually recruiting his numbers, as all the fighting men in Greece, <lb/>
            who could find no better way to employ themselves, repaired to his <lb/>
            camp for enlistment. Thus did the Thebans become every year more <lb/>
            and more embarrassed by the war, which at the end of five years, <lb/>
            instead of having accomplished the deliverance of Delphi, had re­ <lb/>
            duced them to contend with their neighbours for supremacy in <lb/>
            Bœotia. About 350 or 349 B.C., such was the low condition of their <lb/>
            finances, that they applied to the Persian monarch for a subsidy, and <lb/>
            received from him a present of three hundred talents, which they <lb/>
            shortly afterwards requited by sending a thousand men under <lb/>
            Lacrates to assist him in the reconquest of Egypt. Yet even this <note type="footnote"> (1) Diodorus, xvi. 38. Pausanias, x. 2; who says the disease of Phayllus was the <lb/>

            assistance did not enable them to achieve any important advantage <lb/>
            over their enemies; and the war was kept up only by a repetition <lb/>
            of petty skirmishes and mutual predatory incursions.1 In the annals <lb/>
            of Diodorus three consecutive years following the Persian loan <lb/>
            present a perfect blank; but his silence will not warrant us in <lb/>
            assuming that there was an entire cessation of all warlike operations. <lb/>
            We know that before the close of the war the Phocians had taken <lb/>
            Corsiæ, a city in the north-eastern part of Bœotia,2 and also the <lb/>
            fortress of Tilphossseum.3 And yet Diodorus never mentions the <lb/>
            taking of either of these places, though he casually alludes to the <lb/>
            former as being in the possession of the Phocians.4 We collect also <lb/>
            from other sources, that the war was carried on both in Phocis and <lb/>
            Bœotia; nor is it at all likely, either that Phalæcus would keep his <lb/>
            paid soldiers inactive in their quarters, instead of employing them to <lb/>
            annoy the enemy and gather plunder, or that the Thebans would sit <lb/>
            contentedly at home while their territories were overrun and pillaged <lb/>
            by the Phocian general. The progress of the war was altogether to <lb/>
            the disadvantage of the Thebans.6</p>
          <p>In the summer of 348 B.C., the Thebans opened the campaign <lb/>
            with an invasion of Phocis, and gained a victory of no great im­ <lb/>
            portance at Hyampolis. Returning home by Coronea, they encoun­ <lb/>
            tered the army of Phalæcus, and were defeated with considerable <lb/>
            loss. Not discouraged by this failure, they again entered and ravaged <lb/>
            the enemy's country, and again on their return suffered defeat.6 We <lb/>
            see by their style of warfare, that the Thebans knew but little of the <lb/>
            improved method of besieging fortresses, which Philip had so success­ <lb/>
            fully employed; or they were destitute of the means of carrying on <lb/>
            such operations. Annoyed and harassed though they were by <lb/>
            hostile garrisons in Bœotian cities, they make no vigorous attempt <lb/>
            to recapture them; but can only resort to the old system of ravaging <lb/>
            the land of their adversaries.</p>
          <p>But while Phalæcus kept his ground in Bceotia, and conducted <lb/>
            the war there with success, his power was undermined by an adverse <lb/>
            party at home, who excited the people against him. It seems that, <lb/>

              treasures every year more and more sensibly diminished, the moderate <lb/>
              Phocian statesmen and the bulk of the people viewed the affair with <lb/>
              increased displeasure and alarm. The former generals had given great <lb/>
              offence by apparelling their wives, mistresses, or favourites, in some <lb/>
              of the choicest ornaments of the temple, such as the celebrated <lb/>
              necklaces of Helen and Eriphyle.1 Phayllus had bestowed a golden <lb/>
              ivy-wreath, a present of the Peparethians to Apollo, upon some <lb/>
              favourite girl, a flute-player; and he introduced her with this wreath <lb/>
              to play the flute at the Pythian games; but the audience would not <lb/>
              permit her to appear.2 The Phocians were a simple people of pri. <lb/>
              mitive habits and tastes, insomuch that even the better classes used <lb/>
              to keep no servants in their houses, but the younger members of a <lb/>
              family waited upon the elder. They were therefore a little scandalised, <lb/>
              when the wife of Philomelus had two female domestics to attend <lb/>
              upon her; and far more so at the number of slavessoon afterwards <lb/>
              brought into the country, who could only subsist (it was thought) by <lb/>
              eating the bread of the poorer citizens.3 Yet with all their luxury <lb/>
              and extravagance, and with all the shock which it gave to Phocian <lb/>
              prejudices, the generals by means of their military power, and by the <lb/>
              success which usually attended their arms, had silenced the murmurs <lb/>
              of the people. But at length it became obvious to every eye, that <lb/>
              the fund which had supplied their prodigality would in no very long <lb/>
              time become exhausted;4 and the Phocians in alarm began to ask <lb/>
              themselves-“ What will the Greeks say, when all the Delphian <lb/>
              treasures are actually gone P and what means of defending ourselves <lb/>
              shall we have then ?"—Fear thus drove them into a condemnation of <lb/>
              measures which they had so long either sanctioned or tolerated. <lb/>
              Phalæcus, at the suggestion of one of his followers, had dug for a <lb/>
              concealed treasure in the very centre of the temple, under the <lb/>
              ground of the prophetic tripod. There was a traditional belief, <lb/>
              founded upon two verses in Homer,5 that immense riches lay under <lb/>
              the stone floor of Apollo; and here they expected to find them. The <lb/>
              soldiers however, who began to excavate the ground, were stopped <lb/>
              by an earthquake, which terrified all present: it seemed as if Apollo <lb/>
              had given a solemn warning, that the violators of his sanctuary would <lb/>
              soon be punished. The enemies of Phalæcus were encouraged to <lb/>
              try an impeachment against him; and they accused him before the <lb/>
              people of having embezzled the sacred treasures. To have charged <note type="footnote"> (1) Diodorus, xvi. 64.

              him with expending them in the prosecution of the war would have <lb/>
              been palpably unjust. A distinction therefore was drawn between <lb/>
              their application to public and to private purposes. The people, <lb/>
              considering that Phalæcus had wasted the funds on objects of per­ <lb/>
              sonal ambition and vanity, passed a vote of condemnation, and <lb/>
              deposed him from his office. Three generals were elected in his <lb/>
              room, Dinocrates, Callias, and Sophanes, with instructions to make <lb/>
              a searching inquiry into the misapplication of the sacred fund. An <lb/>
              account was demanded of the persons through whose hands it had <lb/>
              passed. The chief manager was one Philo, who, not being able to <lb/>
              render any account, was convicted of embezzlement, and after suffering <lb/>
              the torture, betrayed his accomplices. They were all put to death; <lb/>
              the plunder which they had taken, at least what remained of it, was <lb/>
              restored, and brought into the public exchequer. It was computed, <lb/>
              that the aggregate of treasure, which had been taken from the <lb/>
              Delphic temple since the beginning of the war, amounted in value to <lb/>
              more than ten thousand talents.1</p>
          <p>There could be little doubt, that such a wholesale destruction of a <lb/>
            property not only sacred in general estimation, but in some sort <lb/>
            national, would, as soon as its extent was fully known, raise a new <lb/>
            outcry against the Phocians in Greece. No one had ever been known <lb/>
            before to lay sacrilegious hands upon the Delphic temple. The <lb/>
            penalty which Xerxes paid for the attempt was a well-known matter <lb/>
            of history.2 The proposal of the Corinthian envoy at Sparta, to <lb/>
            borrow money from Delphi and Olympia for equipping a fleet, had <lb/>
            never been acted upon, though it may have given rise to that clause <lb/>
            in the treaty of peace, which provided for the security of the sacred <lb/>
            treasures.3 Jason, as we have seen, was suspected of designs upon <lb/>
            Delphi, and his death was hailed with joy by the cities of Greece.4 <lb/>
            A scheme is attributed to Dionysius, of penetrating through Epirus <lb/>
            into Phocis, and seizing upon the temple; and it is related that, in <lb/>
            order to get a footing on the Epirotic coast, he entered into an <lb/>
            alliance with the Illyrians, and assisted them to restore Alcetas the <lb/>
            Molossian to his kingdom; but the project was not carried any <lb/>
            further.5 Now however the whole accumulated wealth of the <lb/>
            sanctuary bad been swept away by a people who ought most especially <lb/>
            to have been its guardians and protectors. Such were the reflections <note type="footnote"> (1) Diodorus, xvi. 56.

            likely to be made in Greece; and the Phocians were filled with <lb/>
            gloomy forebodings at the prospect before them.</p>
          <p>Their fears were soon to be increased by more alarming intelligence. <lb/>
            The Thebans, worn out by a calamitous contest which there seemed <lb/>
            no hope of terminating by their own unaided efforts, determined to <lb/>
            apply for succour to the king of Macedon. This fatal step was taken <lb/>
            in the year B. C. 347. Until then it does not appear that the <lb/>
            Thebans had ever desired his interference: fear or pride may have <lb/>
            prevented them from seeking it. But the continued encroachment <lb/>
            on their territories; the insults to which they were daily exposed by <lb/>
            marauding incursions, which not only weakened their sway over the <lb/>
            cities yet subject to them in Boeotia, but rendered it unsafe to leave <lb/>
            their home except with an armed force; again, the shame of yielding <lb/>
            to an adversary whom they once despised, and a burning desire of <lb/>
            revenge, overcame every other feeling. It was just what Philip <lb/>
            himself had most anxiously looked for. The Thessalians had been <lb/>
            long pressing him to take arms in the cause of the Amphictyons; <lb/>
            but the united petition of the Thessalians and Thebans would invest <lb/>
            him with a still more august character, and enable him to terminate <lb/>
            the war more easily. It excluded also the possible contingency <lb/>
            of a junction between Thebes and Athens, leading to some peaceful <lb/>
            settlement of the Phocian question.1 He did not hesitate therefore <lb/>
            a moment in accepting the invitation of the Thebans; and a soleam <lb/>
            engagement was entered into between them, and ratified by their <lb/>
            mutual oaths, by which Philip bound himself, with due support <lb/>
            from his allies, to accomplish the deliverance of Delphi, the punish­ <lb/>
            ment of the impious Phocians, and the restitution of the Amphicty­ <lb/>
            onic congress.2 Diodorus says, that he sent a small body of troops im­ <lb/>
            mediately into Bœotia, as an earnest that he was sincere in the cause. a <lb/>
            It is certain that Parmenio led an army this year into Thessaly, and <lb/>
            proceeded at the request of the Pharsalians to besiege Halus. He may <lb/>
            have sent a few troops across the gulf of Pagasæ to Eubœa, and <lb/>
            thence to Bœotia. Their presence may have encouraged the Thebans <lb/>
            to try another invasion of Phocis, in which they inflicted some loss <lb/>
            upon the enemy, surprising and dispersing a large body of them who <lb/>
            were engaged in erecting a fortress near Abæ. The greater part of <note type="footnote"> (1) Demosthenes, De Coron, 231. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) Demosthenes, De Fals. Leg. 443.

            observe, that Philip from the first held himself out as the professed enemy of the <lb/>
            Phocians, and would not allow them to be included in the treaty. It was only sug­ <lb/>
            gested by Æschines, that he would turn out to be their friend at the last. Moreover, <lb/>

            early demonstration of his goodwill. The words of Diodorus are: '0 <foreign xml:lang="grc">δὲ βασιλεὶτ <lb/>

            the Phocians escaped ; but five hundred, who fled for refuge into the <lb/>
            temple, perished by an accidental fire which consumed the sacred <lb/>
            edifice.1</p>
          <p>Rumours of Philip's hostile intentions having reached the Phocian <lb/>
            government, embassies were sent instantly both to Athens and to <lb/>
            Lacedæmon, praying for assistance. The most effectual means of <lb/>
            averting the threatened danger was to hold the pass of Thermopylæ, <lb/>
            as before, which could not be done without the aid of a powerful <lb/>
            naval force. The Phocian envoys offered to put the Athenians in <lb/>
            possession of the three fortresses, Alponus, Thronium, and Nicsea, <lb/>
            which commanded the entrance to Thermopylae. A decree was <lb/>
            passed by the Athenians, empowering their general Proxenus to <lb/>
            receive those places from the Pnocians, and ordering an equipment of <lb/>
            fifty galleys and a muster of all their citizens fit for service under <lb/>
            thirty years of age. Proxenus, sailing with the Phocian envoys <lb/>
            to the Malian gulf, applied to the commanders of the fortresses, <lb/>
            &gt; requesting them to be delivered up to him according to promise. <lb/>
            Unfortunately however, the revolution which had taken place in <lb/>
            Phocis prevented the completion of this arrangement. It seems that <lb/>
            Phalæcus, after his deposition from office, still retained his command <lb/>
            over the mercenaries, whose confidence he possessed; and retiring <lb/>
            from Phocis, (if indeed he was not abroad when the revolution <lb/>
            happened,) took up his quarters as before with the troops in Bœotia. <lb/>
            The commanders of the fortresses in Locris as well as Bceotia were <lb/>
            his officers, and devoted to his cause. When the order came from <lb/>
            home, to deliver up the Locrian cities to the Athenians, Phalæcus <lb/>
            regarded it as an act of hostility to himself, rather than a measure of <lb/>
            defence against the common enemy; and so much did he resent it, that <lb/>
            he not only refused compliance with the order, but threw the Phocian <lb/>
            envoys into prison, and insulted the Athenian heralds who announced <lb/>
            the truce of the Eleusinian mysteries. This happened in the month <lb/>
            of Boedromion (September), 347 B. c. Soon afterwards Archidamus <lb/>
            arrived with a thousand Lacedaemonians, and offered to guard the for­ <lb/>
            tresses ; but Phalæcus declined the offer, telling him to mind his own <lb/>
            business, and not trouble himself with that of the Phocians.2 Notwith­ <lb/>
            standing this answer, the Spartan king remained for some time with <lb/>
            his allies ; and the Athenian fleet, which had been sent to the straits, <lb/>
            was kept stationed at Oreus, to act as occasion might require.3</p>
          <p>Thus by the dissensions of the Phocian people, happening unfortu­ <lb/>
            nately at a most critical time, the Athenians were prevented from occupy­ <lb/>
            ing Thermopylae, the only measure which could prevent the destructive <note type="footnote"> (1) Diodorus, xvi. 58. Demosthenes, De Palo.

            inroad of Philip. There was time enough however to rectify this <lb/>
            false step. The pass might yet be defended: the Phocian native <lb/>
            troops and mercenaries united could form an army of twenty <lb/>
            thousand men; and, if well supported by their allies, would not be <lb/>
            vanquished very easily. Philip was aware of this, and with his <lb/>
            usual prudence studied how he could smooth his way to a certain <lb/>
            and easy conquest. His plan was to withdraw the Athenians from <lb/>
            the Phocian alliance, by concluding a separate peace with them; and <lb/>
            lest before the termination of the war they should change their <lb/>
            minds, he resolved to amuse them by deceitful promises, and lead <lb/>
            them into a false security, till it should be too late to save the <lb/>
            Phocians from ruin. That this was the general scheme of Philip, <lb/>
            and that it was ably and artfully accomplished by him, is certain. As <lb/>
            to the details of its execution-and how far he was assisted by the <lb/>
            treason or by the culpable negligence of Athenian statesmen-there <lb/>
            is some degree of uncertainty, owing to the want of historical in­ <lb/>
            formation.1</p>
          <p>Already had Philip, even early in the year 347 B. c., caused it <lb/>
            to be indirectly communicated at Athens, that he was desirous of <lb/>
            peace. According to Æschines, the intimation was first made by some <lb/>
            Eubœan envoys, who came to Athens to settle terms of peace on their <lb/>
            own account.2 But not much attention was paid to them. After the <lb/>
            capture of Olynthus the Athenians, exasperated against Philip and <lb/>
            terrified by his successes, passed vehement resolutions against him in <lb/>
            the assembly, and sent envoys to Peloponnesus and elsewhere to <lb/>
            warn the Greeks of the danger which threatened them from his <lb/>
            ambition. This was the occasion upon which Æschines went to <lb/>
            Arcadia, and addressed a violent Philippic to the Ten Thousand at <lb/>
            Megalopolis. a About the same time Timarchus made his motion, <lb/>
            prohibiting, on pain of death, the carrying of arms or naval stores to <lb/>
            Philip.4 Eubulus and his friends, who represented the peace party at <lb/>
            Athens, beginning now to see danger from Macedonia, looked to a <lb/>
            reconciliation with Thebes as their best security, and would gladly <lb/>
            have taken measures to bring it about. Unhappily the feelings of <lb/>
            the two people were so embittered against each other, that an <lb/>
            amicable adjustment at this time was impossible,5 and it was soon <note type="footnote"> (1) The materials for the history of these proceedings are chiefly derived from the <lb/>
            speeches of Demosthenes and Æschines on the Embassy and the Crown, in which <lb/>
            the orators not only frequently contradict each other, but are not always consistent <lb/>
            with themselves. We cannot therefore safely assume as true any one-sided state­ <lb/>
            ment in any of these speeches, which is not supported by some collateral proof or <lb/>
            strong probability. There are many points of contention between them, rather of <lb/>
            a private and personal than of a political or historical bearing. These I have gene­ <lb/>

            the embassies and negotiations. (2) Machines, De Fals. Leg. a. </note><note type="footnote"> (3) Demosthenes, Do Fals. Leg. 344,426,427,438,439. Æschines, De Palo.

            discovered that there were no better hopes from the rest of the <lb/>
            Greeks, who could not be made to understand, that the cause of <lb/>
            Athens against Macedonia was one in which they were much inte­ <lb/>
            rested themselves.1 Under these circumstances a renewal of Philip's <lb/>
            pacific overtures met with a more favourable reception. He so con­ <lb/>
            trived it, that they came through the mouth of Athenian citizens. <lb/>
            One Phrynon, complaining at Athens that he had been taken by a <lb/>
            Macedonian privateer during the Olympian truce, got himself <lb/>
            to be sent to Philip in the quality of an ambassador, to recover <lb/>
            the ransom which he had been compelled to pay.2 Ctesiphon <lb/>
            was sent with him, and brought back a report, not only that the <lb/>
            ransom had been restored, but that Philip professed the greatest <lb/>
            goodwill towards Athens, that he had reluctantly engaged in hos­ <lb/>
            tilities with her, and was anxious to put an end to them. This report <lb/>
            having been well received by the people, Philocrates moved that <lb/>
            Philip should have permission to send a herald and ambassadors <lb/>
            to treat for peace. The motion was carried without opposition: <lb/>
            but the war party were still determined to try their strength, and <lb/>
            they preferred an indictment against Philocrates, charging him with <lb/>
            having passed a measure contrary to the spirit of the Athenian laws. <lb/>
            He was defended by Demosthenes, and acquitted, the accuser not <lb/>
            obtaining a fifth part of the votes.3 It was evident that the current of <lb/>
            feeling at Athens was now for peace. The war, besides stripping them of <lb/>
            numerous possessions, had entailed on the Athenians a loss of fifteen <lb/>
            hundred talents; and the late conquest of Chalcidice had imperilled <lb/>
            their dominions in the Chersonese.4 Athenian prisoners too had been <lb/>
            taken in Olynthus; among them Iatrocles, who was afterwards am­ <lb/>
            bassador. The friends of these men, taking advantage of the general <lb/>
            feeling, presented a petition to the assembly, requesting that their <lb/>
            case might be considered. The appeal had its effect; and the people <lb/>
            consented that Aristodemus the actor might be sent to Macedonia, to <lb/>
            see what could be done on behalf of the prisoners, and to ascertain <lb/>
            what Philip's intentions were on the subject of peace. The com­ <lb/>
            mission was somewhat irregular, but the professional character and <lb/>
            celebrity of Aristodemus rendered him a sort of privileged person.5 <lb/>
            He was absent for some time, engaged very likely (together with <lb/>
            Neoptolemus the actor, who obtained similar leave of absence) in the <lb/>
            Olympic festivities of Dium. His report was, that Philip had the <note type="footnote"> (1) Æschines, De Fals. Leg. 38. Demosthenes, De Coron. 231, 233. </note><note type="footnote"> f2) There is a difficulty about the Olympic truce spoken of in the passage of <lb/>

            most friendly disposition towards Athens, and wished to become her <lb/>
            ally. Neoptolemus came back with the same story: the appearance <lb/>
            of Iatrocles, who had been liberated without ransom, tended to con­ <lb/>
            firm their statements.1</p>
          <p>Yet, notwithstanding these assurances of Philip's desire for peace, <lb/>
            the time passed on without his making any direct overture, or send­ <lb/>
            ing any herald or minister to Athens. The Athenians, having once <lb/>
            entertained the hope of peace, became impatient for its consumma­ <lb/>
            tion ; and their anxiety was still further increased by the suspicious <lb/>
            conduct of Phalæcus, and the apparent weakness of the Phocian <lb/>
            government. At length, upon the motion of Philocrates, a decree <lb/>
            was passed, that ten ambassadors should be sent to Macedonia, to <lb/>
            open a treaty of peace, and discuss the terms with Philip. Thus was <lb/>
            accomplished, by the agency of the same Philocrates, who continues <lb/>
            henceforth to take the lead in every step of this negotiation, the very <lb/>
            thing which Philip bad been contriving, viz. that the first formal pro­ <lb/>
            posal for peace should come from the Athenians. Ten ambassadors <lb/>
            were chosen accordingly—Demosthenes, Æschines, Aristodemus,Ctesi­ <lb/>
            phon, Phrynon, Iatrocles, Philocrates, Dercyllus, Cimon, and Nausi­ <lb/>
            cles-to whom was added Aglacreon of Tenedos, as representative <lb/>
            of the allies. Their instructions were, to ascertain positively whether <lb/>
            Philip was desirous of peace; and if he were, to bring ambassadors <lb/>
            from him with power to conclude it.2</p>
          <p>A herald was sent before the ambassadors, to procure them a safe <lb/>
            conduct. They did not wait however for his return, but, having <lb/>
            sailed to Oreus in Eubœa, they crossed over to Halus, then be­ <lb/>
            sieged by Parmenio, and obtained permission to pass through his <lb/>
            lines to Pagasæ, from which they pursued their journey to Larissa, <lb/>
            and there meeting the herald, proceeded with all the speed they could <lb/>
            to the Macedonian capital, and obtained an interview with the king. <lb/>
            This was early in the year 346 B.c. The transactions of the em­ <lb/>
            bassy are chiefly gathered from AEschines, who entertains us with a <lb/>
            good deal of gossip about the journey, and what passed among the <note type="footnote"> (1) AEschines, De Pals. Leg. SO. The order of these events is taken from Æschines, <lb/>
            and may perhaps be correct. Demosthenes appears to differ from him in this only, <lb/>
            that he makes Aristodemus to have first mentioned the subject of peace. (De Coron. <lb/>
            232.) This indeed is not absolutely inconsistent with the account of Æsehines; and <lb/>
            it is not clear that either of them pretends to give accurate details of the whole pro­ <lb/>
            ceeding. Compare Demosthenes, De Fals. Leg. 344, 371, 443. From the statements <lb/>
            of the two orators one is strongly induced to suspect, that some at least of these <lb/>
            men, Phrynon, Ctesiphon, Aristodemus, Iatrocles, and Neoptolemus, were from the <lb/>
            first acting in corrupt concert with Philip. Phrynon, if we can believe Demosthenes, <lb/>
            was a man steeped in infamy. (De Pals. Leg. 412.) Neoptolemus, after the peace, <lb/>
            sold all his property in Athens, and went to live in Macedonia. Demosth. De Pace, <lb/>

              ambassadors in private, but omits much that we should have liked to <lb/>
              know about more important matters. We are told about the offen­ <lb/>
              sive conduct of Demosthenes towards his colleagues, and his entire <lb/>
              failure and breaking down in the attempt to address Philip: we <lb/>
              have an account also of the speech made by Æschines himself on the <lb/>
              same occasion, in which he enlarged upon the ancient connexion be­ <lb/>
              tween Amyntas, Philip's father, and the Athenians, and the grounds <lb/>
              upon which his countrymen maintained their right to Amphipolis.1 <lb/>
              Of the reply which Philip made to the ambassadors we learn nothing <lb/>
              more, than that it was addressed mainly to the arguments of <lb/>
              Æschines; though we are assured that he astonished them all by <lb/>
              his good memory and powers of speech; and still further charmed <lb/>
              them by his hospitality and politeness at the banquet. The end of it <lb/>
              was, the ambassadors brought back a letter from Philip to the Athe­ <lb/>
              nians, in which he assured them that he was desirous both of peace <lb/>
              and alliance with Athens, that he was inclined to be her friend, and <lb/>
              he would have stated expressly what service he meant to render her, <lb/>
              if he could have been sure of being her ally. The terms of peace <lb/>
              which he offered were, that both parties should retain what they <lb/>
              possessed; which of course secured to Philip all his previous con­ <lb/>
              quests, and, owing to a want of firmness on the part of the Athe­ <lb/>
              nian envoys, enabled him to retain conquests which he made between <lb/>
              that time and the conclusion of the treaty. Philip gave them to <lb/>
              understand before they left him, that he was about to march against <lb/>
              Cersobleptes; yet no stipulation was made on behalf of that prince, <lb/>
              though he was an ally of Athens: Philip only promised, that pend­ <lb/>
              ing the negotiations for peace, he would not attack the Chersonese. <lb/>
              Whether anything passed between them on the subject of Phocis <lb/>
              and the Sacred War, we are not informed. The ambassadors re­ <lb/>
              turned home with a Macedonian herald about the first of Elaphebo­ <lb/>
              lion (March). Philip's envoys were to follow shortly, to settle the <lb/>
              terms of peace at Athens.2</p>
          <p>A formal report of their proceedings was made by the ambassadors, <lb/>
            in the manner required by Athenian law, first to the council and <lb/>
            afterwards to the popular assembly. Demosthenes, rising after his <lb/>
            colleagues, moved the formal grant of safe conduct and hospitality <lb/>
            to the Macedonian herald and ambassadors; and further, that the <lb/>
            presidents of the council should, as soon as the ambassadors arrived, <lb/>
            appoint two consecutive days for holding an assembly to deliberate <lb/>
            on the questions both of peace and alliance. He moved also, as he had <lb/>
            already done in the council, for the usual compliments to the Athenian <note type="footnote"> (1) See as to all these particulars Thirlwall, History of Greece, v. 342. Grote, xi. <lb/>

            ambassadors-a vote of thanks, and invitation to dinner in the Pry­ <lb/>
            taneum. The ministers of Philip, three men of high distinction in <lb/>
            their own country—Antipater, Parmenio, and Eurylochus—arrived <lb/>
            a few days after; and the eighteenth and nineteenth days of Elaphe­ <lb/>
            bolion were, on the motion of Demosthenes, appointed for discussing <lb/>
            the questions of peace and alliance with Philip. Demosthenes him­ <lb/>
            self paid marked attention to the Macedonian envoys, entertaining <lb/>
            them handsomely at his own house, and taking care that suitable <lb/>
            places and comfortable seats were provided for them at the Dionysian <lb/>
            festival.1</p>
          <p>At the time when the embassy returned, there were assembled at <lb/>
            Athens the deputies of the Athenian confederacy, who had probably <lb/>
            been sent for on the occasion. To them Aglacreon of Tenedos made <lb/>
            his report; and they on behalf of their constituents passed a reso­ <lb/>
            lution, which, though it was not binding on the Athenians, it be. <lb/>
            hoved them, having regard to the interests of their whole empire, <lb/>
            duly to weigh and consider. Two clauses only of this resolutionare <lb/>
            preserved to us, by quotation in the speeches of AEschines. One <lb/>
            declared2—“ that, whereas the people of Athens were deliberating <lb/>
            on the question of peace with Philip, and the ambassadors were not <lb/>
            yet returned, whom the people had sent into Greece to rouse the <lb/>
            states in defence of Grecian liberty, it was the advice of the confe­ <lb/>
            derates, that, after the ambassadors had arrived and made their re­ <lb/>
            port, the presidents should appoint two assemblies to be held accord­ <lb/>
            ing to the laws for debating on the question of peace: and whatever <lb/>
            the people should decide, that should be agreed to by the confede­ <lb/>
            rates." The other clause recommended3—“ that any of the Greek <lb/>
            states should be at liberty within three months to become parties to <lb/>
            the treaty, by inscribing their names on the pillar of record and <lb/>
            taking the oaths." These clauses are made by JEschines the founda­ <lb/>
            tion of grave charges against Demosthenes—namely, that by fixing <lb/>
            an early day for the assembly, for which it was impossible the Athe­ <lb/>
            nian envoys could return in time, he excluded all chance of benefit <lb/>
            from their mission to the Greek states; and further, that, by opposing <lb/>
            the last clause of the resolution, he prevented his countrymen acting <lb/>
            in concert with the Greeks, which would have been attended with <note type="footnote"> (1) Æschines, De Fats. Leg. 34, 35, 36, 42. Contr. Ctesiph. 62, 63, 64. Demo­ <lb/>

            practical joke upon him and his colleagues. On the journey home he challenged <lb/>
            them to speak, if they dared, in praise of Philip to the people. Ctesiphon and him­ <lb/>
            self accepted the challenge, and in making their report talked about the good looks <lb/>
            and agreeable manners and pleasant companionship of Philip; Demosthenes then <lb/>
            got up, and reproved them for wasting the time of the assembly with idle chitchat. <lb/>
            Æschines in the later speech, but not in the former, says, that Demosthenes moved <lb/>
            for an assembly to be held on the eighth of Elaphebolion, a day sacred to Æsculapius, <lb/>
            and usually kept as a holiday His object is to prove the great anxiety of Demo­ <lb/>
            sthenes to hurry on the peace. It is very possible that such a day may have been <lb/>
            proposed, in the expectation that the ambassadors would arrive in time for it. There <lb/>
            is no doubt that Demosthenes was anxious for a speedy conclusion of the peace. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) AEschines, De Fals. Leg. 35.</note> <note type="footnote">(3) Æschines, Contr. Ctesiph. 63. </note> <lb/>

            this great advantage, that, if Philip afterwards violated the treaty, <lb/>
            they must have made common cause with Athens. Demosthenes in <lb/>
            answer to the charge asserts,1 that there was no embassy at this <lb/>
            time to the Greek states, for the Greeks had all been tried long ago; <lb/>
            and it would have been disgraceful to invite the Greeks to make war, <lb/>
            when they were treating with Philip for peace: and he puts the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing dilemma—“ For what purpose could you have been sending <lb/>
            for the Greeks at that crisis ? To make peace P But they all had peace. <lb/>
            To make war ? But you were yourselves deliberating about peace " <lb/>
            The dilemma is a bad one for this reason, that the embassy had been <lb/>
            sent to the Greeks before any negotiation for peace was opened with <lb/>
            Philip. Yet the answer of Demosthenes was, I believe, substan­ <lb/>
            tially true: for the embassies to rouse the Greeks against Philip had <lb/>
            been despatched six or eight months before, that of AEschines to <lb/>
            Peloponnesus perhaps even earlier; and although it is possible that <lb/>
            some of the envoys had not returned by the month of Elaphebolion, <lb/>
            it had been pretty well ascertained, by the reports of those that had <lb/>
            returned, and from other sources, that no assistance was to be ex­ <lb/>
            pected from the Greeks; in fact, all thoughts of it had been dropped <lb/>
            at Athens, and the people had, partly on that very account, been <lb/>
            driven to seek for peace. This does not rest upon the assertion of <lb/>
            Demosthenes alone. Æschines justifies his own conversion, from a <lb/>
            strenuous opponent of Philip to a warm advocate of peace, upon the <lb/>
            ground that none of the Grecian states would help Athens in her <lb/>
            unequal war—that they were all either on Philip's side, or indifferent <lb/>
            as to the issue of the contest.2 Under these circumstances, although <lb/>
            the synod of allies might think proper to revive this somewhat <lb/>
            stale question of a Greek combination, and to notice the possible <lb/>
            contingency of some good result turning up from the embassies, <lb/>
            it cannot surprise us that little attention was paid to it by the <lb/>
            Athenians. Demosthenes, in naming a day for the discussion of the <lb/>
            peace, fixed it without any reference to a resolution which would <lb/>
            have postponed it indefinitely; and no objection was raised by any <lb/>
            one. The ambassadors had very likely arranged with Philip at Pella, <lb/>
            that an early day should be appointed for the conference with his <lb/>
            ministers : and Demosthenes was desirous that the treaty should be <lb/>
            concluded as soon as possible, in order that Philip might have no <lb/>
            time for making further conquests.</p>
          <p>The first assembly was held on the appointed day, the eighteenth <lb/>
            of Elaphebolion. Antipater and his colleagues attended, and were <lb/>
            introduced to the people in due form. The questions for discussion, <lb/>
            as prepared by the presidents of the council, were read: so was the <lb/>
            resolution of the confederacy. A motion was made by Philocrates, <note type="footnote"> (1) Demosthenes, De Coron. 233. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Οὓτε γὰρ ἢν πρεσβεία πρὸς οὐδένας ἀπεσταλμένη <lb/>

            embodying the terms of peace which Philip was willing to grant. In <lb/>
            the debate which followed, many points were hotly contested between <lb/>
            the different speakers. One was, whether there should be peace <lb/>
            only, or peace and alliance with Philip. Another was, whether the <lb/>
            Phocians and Halians should be included in the treaty. Philocrates <lb/>
            in his decree had inserted a special clause for their exclusion, which <lb/>
            he knew to be desired by Philip; but the sense of the meeting was <lb/>
            against him, and Æschines as well as Demosthenes opposed the <lb/>
            clause. A discussion arose also upon that recommendation of the <lb/>
            allies, by which the Greek states were to have the option of becom­ <lb/>
            ing parties to the treaty. According to Æschines, all the speakers, <lb/>
            (including himself) were in favour of it; and it was the general <lb/>
            opinion, that the alliance with Philip should be postponed until the <lb/>
            Greeks had an opportunity of declaring themselves.2 Many objec­ <lb/>
            tions were raised to the terms offered by Philip, which, it was said, <lb/>
            involved concessions disgraceful to Athens, such as the relinquish­ <lb/>
            ment of Amphipolis, Cardia, and other places of right belonging to <lb/>
            her. Eubulus told the people what he considered the plain truth, <lb/>
            that they must either go down to the Piræus immediately, pay a pro­ <lb/>
            perty tax, and convert the theatric fund into a military one, or vote <lb/>
            for the decree of Philocrates.3 Notwithstanding his admonition, the <lb/>
            vehemence of anti-Macedonian orators made an impression on the <lb/>
            assembly.</p>
          <p>The next day Demosthenes endeavoured to allay the ferment which <lb/>
            had been excited. He advised the people to accept the proffered <lb/>
            alliance of Philip, pointing out to them the true position of things; <lb/>
            that it would be imprudent as well as inconvenient to postpone the <lb/>
            question-that it was one which concerned them and their allies only, <lb/>
            not the whole body of the Greeks-and that there was no necessity <lb/>
            &lt;or people who were not at war with Philip to enter into a treaty of <lb/>
            peace with him.4 At the same time he insisted that all the allies of <note type="footnote"> (1) That Æschines opposed the decree of Philocrates on the first day, is stated by <lb/>
            Demosthenes, De Fals. Leg. 345; and this was probably the chief ground of his <lb/>
            opposition. Grote however thinks differently. See his reasons, History of Greece, <lb/>

            of the allies. If by this he meant the clauses quoted by Æschines, the assertion is <lb/>
            not credible, since by his own showing (De Coron. 233) there could have been no use <lb/>
            in supporting them; nor does he pretend in the later speech, where he replies to <lb/>
            Machines, that he did support them. It is possible however, that he refers to some <lb/>
            other suggestion in the decree which is not preserved, or to some general words <lb/>
            recommending a fair and equitable peace. In the first passage, <foreign xml:lang="grc">έμον̃τω̨̃ τω̃ν συμ­ <lb/>

            the latter clause is explanatory of the former; so that it signifies, " when I, in con­ <lb/>
            formity with the resolution of the allies, laboured to make the peace equitable and <lb/>
            just." In what particular equitable and just, he does not say: he may refer either <lb/>
            to the question of including the Phocians, or to some other which is not mentioned. <lb/>
            We gather nothing definite from it. Nearly as vague is the assertion at page 385. <lb/>
            He affects however to disclaim all participation in the decree of Philocrates, which <lb/>
            is too improbable to be believed. Common experience shows how easy a thing it is, <lb/>
            to misreport what a man has said some time ago. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="291"/>
            Athens should be comprehended in the treaty, condemning as unjust <lb/>
            and impolitic the proposal of Philocrates to exclude the Phocians and <lb/>
            Halians. Æschines spoke to the same effect, but still more strongly, <lb/>
            and in the strain of Eubulus, showing the folly and danger of carry­ <lb/>
            ing on war without adequate means-reproving those speakers who <lb/>
            by unseasonable counsel would hurry on the people to their ruin­ <lb/>
            and reminding them that, although the peace offered by Philip might <lb/>
            not be the most honourable in the world, it was not more disgraceful <lb/>
            than the war had been. The result was, that an amended decree <lb/>
            was carried, omitting the obnoxious article which excluded the Pho­ <lb/>
            cians and Halians, but in other respects coinciding with the original <lb/>
            motion of Philocrates. It established peace and alliance between <lb/>
            Philip and the Athenians and their respective allies, and secured to <lb/>
            each party all such territory and dominion, whether acquired by con­ <lb/>
            quest or otherwise, as each actually possessed at the time.1</p>
          <p>To give anything like a history of what passed in these assemblies, <lb/>
            one has to choose between the conflicting statements of the rival <lb/>
            orators. I reject as entirely false the assertion of Æschines,2 that <lb/>
            there was no debate on the second day, notwithstanding the evidence <lb/>
            which he produces of a decree of Demosthenes, which restricted the <lb/>
            business of that day to taking the votes. In the first place, the <lb/>
            proof offered is suspicious and doubtful; and in the next place, the <lb/>
            fact is inconsistent with other statements of his own. Let us see <lb/>
            how the matter stands. Demosthenes accuses him of having spoken <lb/>
            against Philocrates on the first day, and in his support on the second <lb/>
            day. Æschines says: he could not have been guilty of this, because <lb/>
            there was no speaking allowed on the second day, by reason 6f the <lb/>
            decree which he produced. Now, supposing that there was a decree <lb/>
            which prohibited speaking, it is still very possible that the irregu­ <lb/>
            larity might be committed, perhaps encouraged by the people, or at <lb/>
            least not objected to. AEschines should have produced a witness to <lb/>
            prove that there actually was no speaking, rather than a documen­ <lb/>
            tary piece of evidence which only shows that there ought to have <lb/>
            been none, and is but an argumentative denial of the fact. It ap­ <lb/>
            pears that he came prepared to meet the charge,, and therefore we <lb/>
            might expect better proof. But further; according to his own state­ <lb/>
            ment, it is certain that this decree was not acted upon: and next to <lb/>
            certain, that there was a debate on the second day, in which Æschines <lb/>
            spoke more strongly in favour of the motion ofPhilocrates than he <lb/>
            bad spoken on the first day. He says in the speech against Ctesi­ <lb/>
            phon, that on the first day all the orators (including himself) sup­ <lb/>
            ported the recommendation of the allies, to bring the Greek states <lb/>
            into the treaty; that, when the assembly broke up, the general <note type="footnote"> (1) Æschines, De Fals. Leg. 36—38. Contr. Timarch. 24. Contr. Ctesiph. 63, 64. <lb/>
            Demosthenes, De Halonn. 82, 83. De Coron. 234. De Fals. Leg. 354, 385. That an <lb/>
            attempt was afterwards made to bring all the Greek states within the protection of <lb/>

            opinion was, that it was not advisable to conclude an alliance with <lb/>
            Philip, till it could be done in conjunction with the Greek body. If <lb/>
            so, what caused the people to change their opinion the next morning? <lb/>
            How came they to pass the decree for alliance as well as peace ? <lb/>
            There must have been another debate; and that there was one, is <lb/>
            clear from Æschines himself, who says that Demosthenes addressed <lb/>
            the assembly. He says indeed, that Demosthenes cut the matter very <lb/>
            short; by simply telling the people that Philip would not have peace <lb/>
            without alliance,1 and appealing to Antipater (with whom he was in <lb/>
            concert) in support of his assertion, he forced the assembly to pass <lb/>
            the decree of Philocrates. To suppose however that Demosthenes <lb/>
            could have carried his point in this off-hand way, is out of the ques­ <lb/>
            tion. The additions we may set down as rhetorical exaggeration. <lb/>
            The fact remains, that Demosthenes did address the people, over? <lb/>
            throwing the argument that no one could have done so, and the <lb/>
            change of opinion to which they were brought is a strong circum­ <lb/>
            stance to prove that there was a regular debate. But again, Æschines <lb/>
            says,2 he sided on the first day with all the speakers who advised <lb/>
            postponement of the alliance with Philip. He says also,3 that he <lb/>
            advised the measure which was ultimately carried. These two state­ <lb/>
            ments are irreconcileable, except on the supposition that he spoke on <lb/>
            both of the assembly days; for on the first he was (by his own ad. <lb/>
            mission) a dissentient to one of the most important articles, and, as <lb/>
            this ultimately passed, he must have supported it on the second day. <lb/>
            Thus by his own showing Æschines stands convicted of pairing <lb/>
            with the truth. I do not hesitate therefore in accepting the state­ <lb/>
            ment of Demosthenes to this extent, that Æschines, in the assembly <lb/>
            held on the nineteenth of Elaphebolion, spoke decidedly and strongly <lb/>
            in favour of the amended decree.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, it appears to me that Demosthenes, when he <lb/>
            accuses AEschines of having entirely shifted his ground on the <lb/>
            second day and given disgraceful advice to the Athenians, deals un­ <lb/>
            fairly with his adversary, and misrepresents the import of what he <lb/>
            really said.4 The position of things at the beginning of that day has <note type="footnote"> (1) Demosthenes said, " they must not dissever the alliance from the peace. If <foreign xml:lang="grc">Οὐ <lb/>

              of the war party had talked about Marathon and Salamis, and the <lb/>
              great deeds of their ancestors, and the duty of upholding Grecian <lb/>
              liberty; themes proper and pertinent enough on some occasions, but <lb/>
              so often enlarged upon and misapplied by third-rate speakers on the <lb/>
              Athenian platform, that sober-minded statesmen must have been <lb/>
              heartily sick of them. AEschines, rising to combat the arguments of <lb/>
              these men, told the people that this was not the time for empty <lb/>
              declamation about ancient trophies and glories, when the question <lb/>
              before them was, how to get rid of a war which they had been waging <lb/>
              many years without either glory or advantage; that the Greeks <lb/>
              during all those years had rendered them no assistance, and they <lb/>
              were not bound to fight the battle of Greece by themselves without <lb/>
              any reasonable chance of success. He advised them therefore to <lb/>
              retire from the contest while they had the opportunity, before any <lb/>
              irretrievable disaster had fallen upon the republic; warning them <lb/>
              emphatically against those hazardous and desperate courses, into <lb/>
              which evil counsels had plunged the Athenians in former times, <lb/>
              referring more particularly to the Sicilian expedition, and to their <lb/>
              refusal to accept the peace offered by Sparta before the end of the <lb/>
              Peloponnesian war.1</p>
          <p>Such is the account which Æschines gives of his own speech, not <lb/>
            only highly probable in itself, but exactly agreeing with what Demo­ <lb/>
            sthenes says in the Oration on the Crown,3 viz. that the Athenians <lb/>
            were driven to make peace with Philip by the conduct of the rest of <lb/>
            the Greeks, who, out of cowardice or ignorance, refused to lend any <lb/>
            help in the common cause. Demosthenes however tortures the <lb/>
            language of his opponent into something very different; as if he <lb/>
            had counselled the Athenians to forget their ancestors altogether, to <lb/>
            shut their ears against all mention of the trophies of olden time, <lb/>
            and never to succour any people who had not previously succoured <lb/>
            them. Language of this sort would indeed have been too absurd <lb/>
            for any Athenian to utter in the assembly. Yet we may observe how <lb/>
            easily, by a little exaggeration or omission, what Æschines really <lb/>
            said is converted into what Demosthenes reports him to have said. <lb/>
            Machines advises the Athenians " not to listen to men who talk <lb/>
            about ancient glories idly and unseasonably." Repeated by the <note type="footnote"> merely to watch the proceedings there; or there may have been Greeks present at <lb/>
            the assembly, without any special mission from their own countries, whom Demo­ <lb/>
            ethenes incorrectly dignifies with the title of envoys. The suggestion of Thirlwall, <lb/>
            (History of Greece, v. 350,) that by these envoys Demosthenes may hare meant the <lb/>
            deputies of the allies then present in Athens, does not agree with the words: <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὒς <lb/>

              adversary, this becomes advice, "not to listen to them at all, or under <lb/>
              any circumstances." Thus do the two orators, in their mutual charges <lb/>
              and recriminations, pervert and misrepresent the words and acts of <lb/>
              one another. Æschines ransacks the public archives for documents <lb/>
              to prove a case against Demosthenes, which he knew to be contrary <lb/>
              to the generally received opinion of his countrymen; that throughout <lb/>
              these proceedings he had acted with corrupt purpose in concert with <lb/>
              Philocrates to serve the interests of Philip.1 Demosthenes, over­ <lb/>
              anxious to disconnect himself from Philocrates, with whom there is <lb/>
              no doubt that up to a certain period he had unsuspiciously coope­ <lb/>
              rated, strives to conceal the part which he took in the first instance <lb/>
              as a joint promoter of the peace, and lays to the charge of Æschines <lb/>
              many things for which he is himself at least equally responsible.2</p>
          <p>The terms of peace having been agreed upon, it remained that the <lb/>
            oaths of ratification should be sworn by both parties, by Philip and <lb/>
            his allies on the one side, and the Athenians and their allies on the <lb/>
            other. In order to administer the oath to Philip and his allies, it <lb/>
            was necessary for the Athenians to appoint another embassy; and <lb/>
            within a day or two after the nineteenth3 they elected the same ten <lb/>
            ambassadors as before. The Athenians and their allies were to have <lb/>
            the oaths administered to them at Athens by the Macedonian envoys, <lb/>
            and an assembly was held on the twenty-third, to make the necessary <lb/>
            arrangements.4 Here a question arose; what allies of the Athenians <lb/>
            were entitled to take the oaths P It principally concerned the Pho­ <lb/>
            cians. Philocrates had already informed his countrymen, that Philip <lb/>
            would not accept them as parties to the treaty, and had on this <lb/>
            ground moved the clause for their exclusion. The rejection of that <lb/>
            clause by the Athenians was a virtual declaration that they regarded <lb/>
            the Phocians as comprehended under the name of allies. Antipater <lb/>
            and his colleagues, having positive instructions from Philip not to <lb/>
            enter into any terms of peace with the Phocians, were compelled to <lb/>
            speak out, and accordingly they gave formal notice to the Athenian <lb/>
            people of their masters determination upon this point. The assembly <lb/>
            was adjourned to the next day for further consideration.5</p>
          <p>Meanwhile Philocrates and his associates concerted their scheme <note type="footnote"> (1) Æschines, Contr. Ctesiph. 62, 65. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) Demosthenes says as little as possible In either of his speeches about the pro­ <lb/>

            transactions of that period. He answers Æschines by vague generalities, denying <lb/>
            that he had anything to do with Philocrates, or was in any way accountable for the <lb/>
            mischievous diplomacy of him and his associates. (De Coren. 232.) </note><note type="footnote"> (3) All that we can gather from Machines is, that the election took place before <lb/>

            The first may not have been well attended, as only formal business was expected; <lb/>

            of operations. It has already been mentioned, what impression had <lb/>
            been made on the Athenians by the reports, which Aristodemus and <lb/>
            others brought from Macedonia, of Philip's goodwill and friendly <lb/>
            feelings to Athens. His own letter, brought by the ambassadors, <lb/>
            spoke mysteriously of the benefits which he designed for them in the <lb/>
            event of becoming their ally. Assurances to the same effect were <lb/>
            repeated by his envoys, and studiously disseminated among the <lb/>
            Athenians by his partisans and agents. To those who inquired, what <lb/>
            Philip could mean by such mysterious promises, hints were given <lb/>
            about Euhœa, Oropus, Thespiæ, Platæa, the settlement of the Pho­ <lb/>
            cian question, and the humiliation of Thebes. Now however, when <lb/>
            Philip's ministers had announced that the Phocians must be ex­ <lb/>
            cluded from the general peace, it became necessary, in order to dis­ <lb/>
            arm suspicion of his intentions, that some explanation, resting on <lb/>
            better authority than mere rumour, should be given to the Athenian <lb/>
            public. Accordingly on the day of the assembly Philocrates came <lb/>
            forward, and in the presence of the Macedonian envoys boldly pro­ <lb/>
            claimed to the Athenians, that it was impossible for Philip, with any <lb/>
            regard to honour or decency, to accept the Phocians openly for his <lb/>
            allies, because he was bound by solemn engagement with the Thebans <lb/>
            and Thessalians to prosecute the Sacred War; he must therefore <lb/>
            ostensibly treat the Phocians as enemies for the present; but let him <lb/>
            once bring the war to an issue, and get the power into his own hands, <lb/>
            he would settle matters exactly as the Athenians desired; the Pho­ <lb/>
            cians would be no sufferers by it, the Thebans would be no gainers, <lb/>
            and Philip would prove himself the friend and benefactor of Athens, <lb/>
            as lie had promised in his letter. The Macedonians stood by, and <lb/>
            apparently assented to all this. Philocrates pretended to speak from <lb/>
            his own knowledge and information, as the confidant of Philip's views <lb/>
            and plans; appealed perhaps to some of his colleagues in the em­ <lb/>
            bassy, who confirmed his statements. No one stood up to contra­ <lb/>
            dict him. What were the Athenians to do ? The Phocian question <lb/>
            was altogether complex and difficult. On the one hand, the seizure <lb/>
            and pillage of Delphi, the exclusion of Amphictyonic Greeks from <lb/>
            the Pythian festival and synod, the occupation of Locris and a part <lb/>
            of Boeotia by the Phocian army, were things not to be defended. <lb/>
            There was a general expectation that, as the Delphic fund was be­ <lb/>
            ginning to fail, the Phocians could not much longer maintain their <lb/>
            position; and the inclination of the Athenians to assist them had <lb/>
            been greatly cooled by the late offensive conduct of Phalæcus. On <lb/>
            the other hand, it would not be very honourable to abandon allies, <lb/>
            with whom they were connected by treaty, and to whom they had <lb/>
            for so many years given a moral, if not an active support. there <lb/>
            would be danger attending the prostration of an independent people, <lb/>
            whose existence formed one of the safeguards of southern Greece; <lb/>
            and still greater peril, if Thermopylae should fall into the hands of a <lb/>
            powerful enemy. But how, if the solution of all these difficulties <lb/>
             <pb n="296"/>
            was now before them ?—if Philip really intended to act as equitable <lb/>
            mediator in the Sacred War, and fulfil the promises which had been <lb/>
            made in his name ? The Phocians would have no reason to complain, <lb/>
            if they were really benefited even against their will. The only doubt. <lb/>
            was, could Philip be trusted P But there was not much time for <lb/>
            deliberation : the Macedonian envoys were about to quit Athens im­ <lb/>
            mediately. Unless their demands were complied with, there was an <lb/>
            end of the peace, which the Athenians had made up their minds to <lb/>
            have, and enjoyed by anticipation already. If they wavered for a <lb/>
            moment, their wishes turned the scale. It does not appear that there <lb/>
            were any Phocian envoys to protest against this sacrifice of their <lb/>
            country ; or that a single warning voice was heard from any leading <lb/>
            orator or statesman. The Athenians were prevailed on by delusive <lb/>
            promises, encouraging their natural indolence, to swear to the treaty <lb/>
            of peace without the Phocians.1</p>
          <p>A question had also arisen about Cersobleptes. One Aristobulus <lb/>
            of Lampsacus appeared as his representative, and demanded to take <lb/>
            the oath in his name as one of the allies of Athens. An objection <lb/>
            was made, as AEschines states by Demosthenes, and, being referred <lb/>
            to the assembly, was overruled. Notwithstanding the decision of <lb/>
            the people, AEschines asserts in his later speech, that Cersobleptes <lb/>
            was excluded ultimately, but upon another ground, by the coutri­ <lb/>
            vance of Demosthenes. It is impossible to determine what really <lb/>
            took place.2</p>
          <p>The oaths were administered to the Athenians and their allies in <lb/>
            the board-room of the generals, on the same day that the assembly <lb/>
            passed their last decree. The Macedonian envoys then took their <lb/>
            departure, Demosthenes accompanying them, as a mark of respect, <lb/>
            a part of the way on their road to Thebes.3 For this, as well as <lb/>
            for the other attentions which he paid them, he is reproached by <note type="footnote"> (1) Demosthenes, De Fals. Leg. 371, 387, 388, 391, 409, 444. There is nothing to <lb/>
            show that Æschines spoke in support of Philocrates in this matter. The use of the <lb/>
            plural <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὺτοι</foreign>, in the passage last cited, is no proof that more than one person sprite; <lb/>
            and it rather tends to prove that Æschines did not. For if he had, Demosthenes <lb/>
            would have mentioned him specially, as he does at p. 347, in reference to his reports <lb/>
            after the second embassy. It is probable that both Æschines and Demosthenes were <lb/>
            passive on this occasion. Neither of them gives us any particulars of what passed; <lb/>
            and each had his reasons for silence. The decree perhaps contained the words <lb/>
            mentioned in Machines, Contr. Ctesiph. 64, requiring the oaths to be taken by the <lb/>
            deputies of the Athenian allies; and possibly it was so drawn up for the very pur­ <lb/>
            pose of shuffling over the difficulty about the Phocians, who, having no deputy <lb/>
            representing them at Athens, like the tributary allies, would not be competent to <lb/>
            swear to the treaty under a decree in such form. It then may have accidentally <lb/>
            created the question about Cersobleptes, which Æschines represents as designedly <lb/>
            raised by Demosthenes, in order to shut him out from the treaty. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) AEschines, De Fals. Leg. 39, 40. Contr. Ctesiph. 64. Demosthenes, De Pala. <lb/>
            Leg. 395, 398. Philipp. Epist. 160. And see the last note. It seems, by comparison <lb/>
            of all the passages, that Cersobleptes was excluded from taking the oath; but on <lb/>
            what ground, or through whose opposition, is uncertain. Thirlwall's conjecture is <lb/>
            by no means improbable; that an objection was raised by the Macedonians, and that <lb/>
            it was reserved by mutual consent to be discussed in a conference with Philip. <lb/>
            (History of Greece, v. 356.) </note><note type="footnote"> (3) AEschines, Contr. Ctesiph. 64. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="297"/>
            Æschines unjustly. The fact however is significant, as tending to <lb/>
            show, that up to that moment Demosthenes was not in opposition to <lb/>
            the promoters of the peace. It suited him at a later period to re­ <lb/>
            present, that he was disgusted with his colleagues before the second <lb/>
            embassy to Macedonia, and that he would not have accepted the <lb/>
            appointment, if he had not promised some of the Athenian prisoners <lb/>
            to bring money for their ransom.1 But there is no evidence of any <lb/>
            act by which he testified displeasure against his colleagues or dis­ <lb/>
            satisfaction with the treaty before his second appointment. He felt <lb/>
            indeed, in common with the rest of his countrymen, that the peace <lb/>
            was not honourable to Athens; nor was it to be expected, when she <lb/>
            had fared so badly in the war: yet still it drew with it certain <lb/>
            advantages, such as financial relief, security for her remaining posses­ <lb/>
            sions, restoration of her captives: and as to other matters, he shared <lb/>
            to some extent in the general delusion.2</p>
          <p>It was deemed however a point of great moment by Demosthenes, <lb/>
            that the peace should be ratified by Philip immediately and com­ <lb/>
            menced in earnest. The Athenians, having once abandoned themselves <lb/>
            ,to the idea of peace, had from that moment discontinued all warlike <lb/>
            preparations; whereas Philip was still carrying on war in Thrace. <lb/>
            In order to put a stop to any further conquests, it was important to <lb/>
            give Philip speedy notice of the treaty having been concluded; and <lb/>
            Demosthenes pressed his colleagues to set off without delay. They <lb/>
            however were in no humour to leave Athens so soon, and refused to <lb/>
            comply with his entreaties. About this time there arrived a letter <lb/>
            from Chares, who commanded an Athenian fleet in the Hellespont, <lb/>
            announcing the defeat of Cersobleptes and the capture of the Sacred <lb/>
            Mountain by Philip. The case seeming urgent, Demosthenes on <lb/>
            the third of Munychion (April) applied to the council, (of which <lb/>
            he was a member, and which had a special authority for such purpose <lb/>
            from the assembly,) and procured an order, commanding the ambas­ <lb/>
            sadors to take their departure instantly, and requiring Proxenus to <lb/>
            convey them wherever he could ascertain Philip to be. The ambas­ <lb/>
            sadors, thus compelled, sailed to Oreus, where Proxenus was stationed <lb/>
            with his squadron; but instead of his conveying them to the Hel­ <lb/>
            lespont or the coast of Thrace, which they might have reached easily <lb/>
            in six or eight days, they were carried to the coast either of Thessaly <lb/>
            or Macedonia, and thence pursued their journey to Pella, consuming <lb/>
            three-and-twenty days. At Pella they had to wait till Philip returned <lb/>
            from his campaign, which did not happen till the fiftieth day after <lb/>
            they had left Athens.3</p>
          <p>The variance between Demosthenes and his colleagues began upon <lb/>
            this journey. He told them plainly that they were bound to obey the <note type="footnote"> (1) Demosthenes, De Fals. Leg. 394, 395. He felt the weakness of that part of his <lb/>
            case, and anticipates the adversary'it objection. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) Demosthenes, De Fals. Leg. 387, 388. </note><note type="footnote"> (3) Demosthenes, De Coron. 233—235. De Fals. Leg. 388—390. Æschines, Do <lb/>

            order of the council; first he reasoned with them, then he remon­ <lb/>
            strated more strongly, at last he reproached them for their conduct in <lb/>
            no lenient terms. All this only excited their anger. The whole body <lb/>
            were against him, and refused either to take their meals with him, or <lb/>
            to put up at the same inn. AEschines says this refusal was owing to <lb/>
            the misbehaviour of Demosthenes on the former embassy; and he <lb/>
            defends the journey to Pella, by alleging that they were not ordered <lb/>
            to go to Thrace, and that it would have been of no use to go there, <lb/>
            when Cersobleptes had lost his kingdom before they left Athens. It <lb/>
            is manifest however, that the order of council was disobeyed both in <lb/>
            the letter and the spirit; and, as AEschines can suggest no better <lb/>
            excuse, the complaint of Demosthenes on this head must be taken <lb/>
            as well founded. The event proved that Philip's Thracian campaign <lb/>
            was not terminated when the ambassadors quitted Athens: it con­ <lb/>
            tinued for five or six weeks after; and during that time many im­ <lb/>
            portant places were captured by him. The son of Cersobleptes he <lb/>
            brought with him as a hostage to Pella.1</p>
          <p>There he found not only the Athenian ambassadors awaiting his <lb/>
            arrival, but others also from various parts of Greece; from Thebes, <lb/>
            Thessaly, Sparta, Phocis, and Eubœa. An immense army was as­ <lb/>
            sembled: it was notorious to all that Philip was about to march to <lb/>
            Thermopylae: what he intended to do was not certainly known to, <lb/>
            any of the parties present; but all were deeply interested in the <lb/>
            result, and agitated by various hopes and fears.2</p>
          <p>The duty of the Athenian ambassadors was by no means clear. It <lb/>
            might be argued, that they had nothing to do but to administer the <lb/>
            oath to Philip and his allies, and then return to Athens and make <lb/>
            their report. As however the treaty had been concluded without <lb/>
            settling the question of the Sacred War; as Philip was virtually left <lb/>
            at liberty to deal with it as he pleased, subject only to a loose pro <lb/>
            mise that he would do what was right and promote the interests of <lb/>
            Athens; it might seem to be proper, when the ambassadors were in <lb/>
            the presence of Philip, that they should come to some positive under­ <lb/>
            standing with him on the subject, and ascertain what lie really meat <lb/>
            to do. By such means they would be enabled, on their return, to <lb/>
            furnish such a report as might guide the Athenians in their future <lb/>
            counsels. True, there could be no guarantee that Philip would per­ <lb/>
            form any engagement which he made to the ambassadors. That <lb/>
            however would not be the fault of the ambassadors, but of the <lb/>
            Athenians themselves, who suffered the Phocian question to go <lb/>
            upon vague assurances, instead of insisting upon the Phocians being <lb/>
            comprehended in the treaty. They had committed the grave error <note type="footnote"> (1) Demosthenes, Do Fals. Leg. 390, 397. Philipp. iv. 183. De Halonn. 85 <lb/>
            JEschines, De Fall. Leg. 38, 40, 41. As regards Cersobleptes, the amount of blame <lb/>
            with which the ambassadors are chargeable depends much upon the question, whether <lb/>
            he was an ally included in the treaty. See ante, p. 296. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) Demosthenes, Do Fall. Leg. 384. Machines, Do Fals. Leg. 41. Justin, vili. 4. </note> <lb/>

            of making peace, without settling the most important matter in the <lb/>
            war; so that in effect the war remained an open question, unless <lb/>
            they chose to leave the Phocians and all their own interests con­ <lb/>
            nected with them entirely to the mercy of Philip. In the instruc­ <lb/>
            tions to the ambassadors there was, besides the special clauses, a <lb/>
            general one, requiring them to do whatever else they could for the <lb/>
            service of the commonwealth; which, under the circumstances, might <lb/>
            be construed as imposing an obligation to discuss with Philip the <lb/>
            affairs of the Sacred War, and bring him over, if possible, to the <lb/>
            side of Athens.</p>
          <p>Such was the view taken apparently by Æschines, who states that <lb/>
            at a conference with his colleagues he urged upon them the necessity <lb/>
            of performing this part of their instructions, and exhorting Philip to <lb/>
            chastise the Thebans and restore the Bœotian cities. Though there <lb/>
            was no express order to this effect, (for such matters could not be <lb/>
            mentioned openly in a state paper,) yet it was clearly, he said, the <lb/>
            true intent and meaning of their countrymen. Demosthenes took <lb/>
            a different view; and after some discussion it was agreed, that each <lb/>
            of the ambassadors should address Philip as he thought fit.1</p>
          <p>Of the audience which the Athenian ambassadors had with the <lb/>
            king, Æschines gives the following account-That Demosthenes <lb/>
            made an offensive speech in disparagement of his colleagues and praise <lb/>
            of himself, recounting the services which he had rendered Philip in <lb/>
            promoting the peace and the attention which he had paid to his <lb/>
            ministers at Athens, and endeavouring to ingratiate himself with <lb/>
            him by fulsome and coarse flattery: after which he (Æschines) com­ <lb/>
            menced his address; first rebuking Demosthenes for his personalities, <lb/>
            then briefly touching upon the subject of the oaths and other formal <lb/>
            matters, lastly, entering upon the topic paramount to all, viz. the <lb/>
            march to Thermopylae, and the affairs of Delphi and the Amphictyons. <lb/>
            He entreated Philip to decide the quarrel by judicial sentence, and <lb/>
            not by arms; but if that were impossible, (as the military prepara­ <lb/>
            tions seemed to indicate,) then, said Æschines, it behoved the cham­ <lb/>
            pion of Hellenic religion to consider what his sacred office required <lb/>
            of him, and to listen to those who could instruct him on the subject <lb/>
            of their ancient institutions. Upon which be explained to the king <lb/>
            all that he knew about the foundation of the temple, the origin of <lb/>
            the Amphictyonic league, the tribes that composed it, their oath and <lb/>
            obligations. He argued that. the Bœotian cities being Amphictyonic, <lb/>
            Philip could not justly allow them to be destroyed. The object of <lb/>
            his expedition was holy and just; but when the Amphictyons were <lb/>
            restored to their rights, punishment should be inflicted upon the <lb/>
            guilty parties only, upon those who actually seized the temple or <lb/>
            who advised it, not upon their countries, if they would deliver up <lb/>
            the offenders for judgment. Should Philip make use of his power <note type="footnote"> (1) Æschines, De Pals. Leg. 41,42. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="300"/>
            to confirm the iniquitous acts of the Thebans, he would not ensure <lb/>
            their gratitude, (for they had been ungrateful to the Athenians, who <lb/>
            had done them still greater services,) and he would make enemies of <lb/>
            the people whom he betrayed.1</p>
          <p>What answer Philip made to this address, AEschines does not say. <lb/>
            It is not pretended that be gave to the collective body of ambas­ <lb/>
            sadors the promises which were afterwards reported at Athens. Yet <lb/>
            that did not prevent him from sending indirect communications to <lb/>
            some of them, whom he thought likely to become his instruments. <lb/>
            He was playing a profoundly artful game. While AEschines was <lb/>
            flattering himself with the impression made by his own harangue, the <lb/>
            Thebans and Thessalians were urging Philip to march against their <lb/>
            common enemy. To them he could speak more openly of his inten­ <lb/>
            tions ; yet they were not free from uneasiness, seeing that intrigues <lb/>
            were still going on, that private conferences were held not only <lb/>
            with the Athenians, but with the Spartans and Phocians, and that <lb/>
            they were apparently not dissatisfied with their reception. The be­ <lb/>
            trayal of any fears or misgivings on the part of his own intimate <lb/>
            allies favoured the illusion which Philip was keeping up. It was <lb/>
            important for him to amuse with hope those parties from whom he <lb/>
            most feared opposition. Phalæcus held the pass of Thermopylae; <lb/>
            Archidamus with a thousand Spartans was yet in Phocis; an Athe­ <lb/>
            nian fleet was ready to occupy the straits, if the people should take <lb/>
            it in their heads to give the order. To prevent the combination of <lb/>
            these forces, which was a very possible contingency, if his designs <lb/>
            should be seen through; to contrive things so that, when he arrived <lb/>
            at the pass, all resistance should be hopeless; these were points to <lb/>
            be accomplished by a tissue of artifice and deceit. AEschines declares <lb/>
            that it was the universal expectation at Pella, that Philip would <lb/>
            humble Thebes; that the Spartan envoys were quarrelling with the, <lb/>
            Theban, and openly threatening them; that the Thebans were in <lb/>
            distress and alarm; that the Thessalians laughed at all the rest, and <lb/>
            said the expedition was for their own benefit; while some of Philip's <lb/>
            officers told some of the Athenian ambassadors, that he meant to re­ <lb/>
            establish the Bœotian cities. This may be taken as no great exag­ <lb/>
            geration of what really occurred.2</p>
          <p>Demosthenes states, that during all the time they were at Pella he <lb/>
            was in opposition to his colleagues; he offered them honest and <lb/>
            sound advice, but every opinion of his was overruled by the majority. <lb/>
            All the service that he could do was, to seek out his captive fellow- <lb/>
            citizens and procure their release, ransoming some of them with his <lb/>
            own money, and prevailing on Philip to redeem the others. Philip <lb/>
            tried to corrupt the ambassadors, first separately, and then jointly. <lb/>
            Demosthenes refused a large present of gold that was sent him. <note type="footnote"> (1) Æschines, De Fals. Leg. 42, 43. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) Æschines, De Fals. Leg. 4$. Demosthenes, Philipp. iii. 113. Do Fals. Leg. <lb/>

             <pb n="301"/>
            Another was offered to the whole body, under the pretence of hospi­ <lb/>
            tality. It was of course a bribe in disguise. As Demosthenes <lb/>
            would accept no share, his colleagues divided it among themselves: <lb/>
            he requested Philip to apply the money that he would have bestowed <lb/>
            in presents towards redeeming the Athenian captives, and Philip was <lb/>
            prevailed upon to promise that they should be sent home by the <lb/>
            Panathenæan festival.1</p>
          <p>All this time the ambassadors never demanded that Philip should <lb/>
            swear the oath, nor said a word about the restoration of the places <lb/>
            captured since the peace, nor sent home any intelligence of the pre­ <lb/>
            parations going on at Pella. They loitered there without any other <lb/>
            reason than the request of Philip himself, who told them he wanted <lb/>
            their mediation to settle the quarrel between the Pharsalians and <lb/>
            Radians; a quarrel which he himself not long afterwards very sum­ <lb/>
            marily decided, by taking the city of Halus and expelling the <lb/>
            population. When all things were ready for his march, Philip set <lb/>
            out, and carried the Athenian ambassadors with him as far as Pherme, <lb/>
            where at length they administered the oaths to him and his allies. <lb/>
            But here they are charged with two further acts of disobedience to <lb/>
            their instructions. They were commanded to administer the oaths <lb/>
            to the magistrates of the cities allied to Philip. Instead of this, <lb/>
            they accepted any persons whom Philip chose to send as accredited <lb/>
            agents for that purpose. Secondly, they allowed Philip and his <lb/>
            allies, on swearing the oaths, to except the Phocians, the Halians, <lb/>
            and Cersobleptes; thereby, it was said, overruling the decree of the <lb/>
            Athenian people, who had refused to admit a clause to that effect in <lb/>
            the treaty. This charge however (as far as regards the Phocians at <lb/>
            least) appears to be unfairly urged against the ambassadors. The <lb/>
            Athenians, having consented on their side to ratify the treaty without <lb/>
            the Phocians, could not expect that Philip would bind himself to <lb/>
            any engagement with them. Indeed the understanding was quite <lb/>
            the contrary. If then the words of the treaty left an ambiguity, it <lb/>
            became necessary for Philip to protest against a construction that <lb/>
            would have been opposite to his declared intentions. Such a protest <lb/>
            was doubtless made. The Athenian ambassadors were informed dis­ <lb/>
            tinctly, that Philip and his allies would not swear to the treaty, except <lb/>
            upon the condition of excluding the Phocians. What then was to <lb/>
            be done ? The ambassadors were in an unavoidable dilemma. Either <lb/>
            they must decline to administer the oaths altogether, or they must <lb/>
            accept the qualification which Philip and his allies insisted upon. <lb/>
            But for what had passed at Athens, the former would have been the <lb/>
            proper course: under existing circumstances, the latter was perhaps <lb/>
            more prudent; otherwise they must have taken upon themselves the <lb/>
            responsibility of renewing the war.2 <note type="footnote"> (1) Demosthenes, De Pals. Leg. 393-395. As to the captives, see the reply of <lb/>

             </p>
          <p>The chief grounds of complaint against the ambassadors were, <lb/>
            their dilatoriness in despatching the business for which they were <lb/>
            sent out, and their neglect to send or carry home correct information <lb/>
            of what was going on. If they acted thus from corrupt motives, <lb/>
            they were of course guilty of treason. Demosthenes, from what he <lb/>
            had seen before, had formed no good opinion of Philip's designs, and <lb/>
            at Pheræ, observing what course things were taking, and being <lb/>
            alarmed both at the danger which threatened his country, and for <lb/>
            fear lest he should himself be implicated in the misconduct of others, <lb/>
            wrote a letter to the Athenians, which gave them full information of <lb/>
            everything. His colleagues, he alleges, would not allow this to be <lb/>
            sent, but themselves despatched another, containing false intelli­ <lb/>
            gence ; a charge in great measure borne out by the reports which <lb/>
            they afterwards made at Athens. He says that he had resolved to <lb/>
            return home alone, and actually hired a vessel for his conveyance, but <lb/>
            was prevented from sailing by Philip. He observed that Æschines <lb/>
            had numerous private interviews with Philip-a thing specially pro­ <lb/>
            hibited by a clause in their instructions;—that one night in particular <lb/>
            he was watched coming out of Philip's tent at Pheræ; and that he <lb/>
            stayed for a day with Philip after the others had gone. Æschines <lb/>
            produces evidence in the nature of an alibi, to disprove that be ever <lb/>
            visited Philip by night, yet apparently does not deny that he had <lb/>
            interviews with him alone in the daytime.1</p>
          <p>Philip, having detained the ambassadors until he was ready to <lb/>
            march to Thermopylae, dismissed them with a letter to the Athenians, <lb/>
            in which he formally notified to them the ratification of the treaty, <lb/>
            and apologised for the manner in which their ambassadors had ad­ <lb/>
            ministered the oaths, stating that they would have gone round to the <lb/>
            different cities, but that he had prevented them, as he wanted their <lb/>
            mediation between the Pharsalians and the Halians. In terms the <lb/>
            letter was polite and gracious, but it contained not a word about the <lb/>
            Phocians, or about the promises which were made in his name.2</p>
          <p>The ambassadors arrived in Athens on the thirteenth of Sciropho­ <lb/>
            lion (June), and presented themselves before the council, as the law <note type="footnote"> appears by the quotation from Philip's letter in Æschines, (De Pals. Leg. 45,) that <lb/>
            he furnished the Athenians with the names of those parties who had taken the <lb/>
            oaths, promising to send to Athens a few who had not come in time. One of the <lb/>
            charges of Demosthenes is, that the Cardians were allowed to appear as allies of <lb/>
            Philip. For this however the ambassadors were not to blame; the Cardians having <lb/>
            been excepted from the treaty by which the Chersonese was ceded to Athens. </note><note type="footnote"> (1) Demosthenes, De Pals. Leg. 352, 357, 396, 397, 419, 445. Æschines, Do FaIs. <lb/>

            alludes. See the remarks in this volume, p. 170. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) See the forcible remarks of Demosthenes upon this letter. (De Pals. Leg. 362, <lb/>
            353, 355.) It was a juggle, lie argues, between Philip and the ambassadors. Philip <lb/>
            took on him the blame of their neglect, and left to them the responsibility of making <lb/>
            false promises in his name. And, although he had promised, if the Athenians would <lb/>
            become his allies, to declare what he meant to do for them, now, when they had <lb/>
            become his allies, he said he knew not what he could do to oblige them; but if they <lb/>
            would tell him, he would do anything that was not dishonourable. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="303"/>
            required. Here Demosthenes, being a member of the council, took <lb/>
            the, initiative, and gave a full report of all that had taken place, <lb/>
            denouncing the treachery of his colleagues, showing into what peril <lb/>
            they had brought the people, and urging that measures should be <lb/>
            taken, before it was too late, to save the Phocians and Thermopylae. <lb/>
            His words produced such an effect upon the council, that in the <lb/>
            order which was drawn up, for bringing the matter before the as­ <lb/>
            sembly, they withheld the vote of thanks and invitation to the public <lb/>
            dining-hall, which ambassadors never failed to receive on other <lb/>
            occasions.1</p>
          <p>The assembly was held on the sixteenth ; and here Æschines got <lb/>
            the first hearing. The people, alarmed by the rumour of Philip's <lb/>
            march, were so eager for the report of the envoys, that they waited <lb/>
            not for the order of council, introducing the business of the day, to <lb/>
            be read. Æschines assured them that they had nothing to fear; <lb/>
            that he had persuaded Philip to gratify their wishes in every parti­ <lb/>
            cular, both on the Amphictyonic question and others;—(he repeated <lb/>
            the heads of the speech which he had made against the Thebans ;)— <lb/>
            they need only remain quiet; in two or three days they would hear <lb/>
            the most satisfactory results ;-the Phocians would be preserved by <lb/>
            Philip; Thebes would be besieged and broken up into villages, Thes­ <lb/>
            piæ and Platæa reestablished, and compensation exacted for the <lb/>
            pillage of Delphi, not from the Phocians, but from the Thebans, who <lb/>
            had originally planned it: he himself had convinced Philip that the <lb/>
            first designers were more guilty than the perpetrators ; 2 and for <lb/>
            giving such counsel, the Thebans had set a price upon his head. <lb/>
            Further, he had heard from some of the Eubcean envoys as a current <lb/>
            report, that their own island was to be given up to the Athenians <lb/>
            instead of Amphipolis; and there was yet another thing which his <lb/>
            diplomacy had obtained for them, which he would not mention at <lb/>
            present, because some of his colleagues were jealous of him. He was <lb/>
            understood to mean Oropus.3</p>
          <p>These assurances, confidently made by an envoy who had had <lb/>
            official communication with Philip, agreeing also with what they had <lb/>
            before heard from Philocrates, relieved the people from their anxiety. <lb/>
            The letter of Philip was produced and read. The Athenians, charmed <lb/>
            by its general professions of amity and good-will, did not detect <lb/>
            their hollowness and insincerity. Demosthenes rose to tell the plain <lb/>

            dazzled by their bright prospects, refused to be undeceived, and I <lb/>
            found it impossible to obtain a fair hearing. AEschines and Phil <lb/>
            crates hooted and interrupted him continually, and were encourage <lb/>
            by the assembly. He could only get in a few words. He proteste <lb/>
            his entire ignorance of what Æschines bad told them, and declare <lb/>
            that he did not believe it. At this the people showed signs of ange <lb/>
            “Remember," cried Demosthenes, " I am not responsible for any c <lb/>
            this." " By and by," said AEschines, " he'll want to have the credi <lb/>
            of it." "No wonder," said Philocrates, " that there is a differenc <lb/>
            of opinion between Demosthenes and me; for he drinks water, an <lb/>
            I drink wine: " at which the Athenians laughed.1</p>
          <p>A decree was then carried, on the motion of Philocrates, thankin <lb/>
            Philip in the warmest terms for his liberality to the republic, an <lb/>
            extending the treaty of peace and alliance to his posterity. It dt <lb/>
            dared also, that, unless the Phocians did what was right and delivere <lb/>
            up the temple of Delphi to the Amphictyons, the people of Athen <lb/>
            would enforce their wishes by arms. This decree, says Demosthenes <lb/>
            in effect delivered the Phocians over to their enemies, with thei <lb/>
            hands tied behind them.2</p>
          <p>There was time to have succoured the Phocians and defendei <lb/>
            Thermopylæ, bad the Athenians acted promptly after the return o <lb/>
            their ambassadors. Phalæcus, who (it seems) had been reinstated i <lb/>
            his command, and still held the Locrian fortresses with his garrisons <lb/>
            could have maintained the pass alone against a greatly superior force <lb/>
            if the enemy were prevented from landing troops in his rear. Hi <lb/>
            safety depended on a continued maritime blockade, and for this pur <lb/>
            pose the cooperation of the Athenians was indispensable. But h <lb/>
            had some reason to doubt their friendly disposition towards In <lb/>
            countrymen, much more towards himself ; and there was no time t&lt; <lb/>
            be lost. He sent chosen messengers to Athens, with orders to lean <lb/>
            the state of things, and bring him intelligence immediately. Thesi <lb/>
            messengers were present at the assembly held on the sixteenth o <lb/>
            Scirophorion, and listening with anxiety to the speeches and all th&lt; <lb/>
            proceedings. Philip in the meantime, approaching Thermopylae, in <lb/>
            vited the Phocians to surrender, representing to them that there wai <lb/>
            no hope of succour from Athens, who had become his ally, and thai <lb/>
            they might safely throw themselves upon his generosity. We ma <lb/>
            presume, that he had already made this communication to them, be <lb/>
            fore he began his march from Pheræ ; and perhaps their own envoys <lb/>
            who accompanied him from Pella, brought home a tale of their kiud <lb/>
            reception by Philip, and his favourable intentions towards their <lb/>
            country.3 The Phocians gave little credit to it: they were not <note type="footnote"> (1) Demosthenes, De Pace, 59. De Fals.

            Athenians had time for consideration, Philip's object was more surely gained. The </note> <lb/>

            disposed to trust Philip, and they could hardly believe that the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians, their old allies, would abandon them: Phalæcus at all events <lb/>
            would send no positive answer to Philip, until he knew what the <lb/>
            intentions of the Athenians were. When however his messengers <lb/>
            returned from Athens, bringing news of what had passed in the <lb/>
            assembly—of the announcements of Æschines, the implicit faith put <lb/>
            in them by the Athenians, their abandonment of everything to Philip, <lb/>
            and the menacing resolutions which they had passed against the <lb/>
            Phocians—he perceived that resistance was hopeless; that neither <lb/>
            himself nor his countrymen had any choice left but to make the best <lb/>
            terms they could with the all-powerful king of Macedon.</p>
          <p>Accordingly on the twenty-third of Scirophorion, within two or <lb/>
            three days after he had received the news from Athens, he entered <lb/>
            into a convention with Philip, agreeing to surrender the fortresses <lb/>
            which he held in Locris and Bœotia, on condition only that he might <lb/>
            retire where he pleased with his troops. It was carried into effect <lb/>
            immediately. Philip entered the pass, and took possession of Al­ <lb/>
            ponus, Thronium, and Nicæa, while Phalæcus, with eight thousand <lb/>
            mercenaries and such of the native soldiers as liked to follow him, <lb/>
            passed over to Peloponnesus. Archidamus with his thousand Spar­ <lb/>
            tans had withdrawn shortly before, seeing the double game that was <lb/>
            played by his allies, and considering his position dangerous. The <lb/>
            Thebans marched out with all their forces to join Philip, who now, <lb/>
            proclaiming openly that he had come as the ally of the Thebans and <lb/>
            Thessalians and the champion of the God, marched with an over­ <lb/>
            powering army into Phocis, to terminate the Sacred War. The cities <lb/>
            generally submitted to his arms; a few that offered a feeble resist­ <lb/>
            ance were taken by storm and razed to the ground. He then took <lb/>
            possession of Delphi, and proceeded forthwith to hold an Amphic­ <lb/>
            tyonic council, to pronounce judgment upon the violators of the <lb/>
            temple, and determine the various questions which the war had given <lb/>
            rise to.1</p>
          <p>The Athenians remained perfectly quiescent, expecting the accom. <lb/>
            plishment of all the good things which Philip had promised them, <lb/>
            until the twenty-seventh day of the month. They had appointed an <lb/>
            embassy to notify to Philip the decree which they passed in his <lb/>
            favour. It consisted mostly of the same ten who served on the <lb/>
            former embassies. Demosthenes, not wishing to go, swore an affi­ <lb/>
            davit, as the law permitted, and excused himself. AEschines stayed <lb/>
            behind on a plea of illness; a mere pretence, as Demosthenes alleges, <lb/>
            in order that he might be at home to prevent the adoption of any <lb/>
            measures adverse to Philip. The envoys had not long departed. <note type="footnote"> Phocian envoys had been amused with promises to the last. Demosthenes, Philipp. <lb/>

              when there came a letter from Philip to the Athenians, followed soon <lb/>
              afterwards by another,1 inviting them to join him with all their forces. <lb/>
              He must have sent the first of these letters immediately after Pha­ <lb/>
              læcus had refused to surrender, while he w<foreign xml:lang="grc">ε</foreign>s yet in doubt what <lb/>
              course things might take. According to the terms of his alliance, <lb/>
              as they had been interpreted and acted upon, he was entitled to <lb/>
              make this demand of the Athenians; though we can hardly imagine <lb/>
              that he either expected or desired their compliance. All that he <lb/>
              really wished was their neutrality; and this his letter, assuming a <lb/>
              tone of friendship, was calculated to secure. It was laid before the <lb/>
              assembly; but no one moved that Philip's request should be granted. <lb/>
              Demosthenes observed, that, if any troops were sent, they would be <lb/>
              hostages in Philip's hands; and the matter was dropped. Æschines <lb/>
              afterwards asserted, that, if an Athenian force had been present, it <lb/>
              might have counteracted the influence of the Thebans and Thes. <lb/>
              salians, who, as it was, compelled Philip to adopt their own violent <lb/>
              counsels. But if he thought so, why, it may be asked, did he not <lb/>
              propose the measure to the people, especially as it was in accordance <lb/>
              with their own decree P Perhaps he could not easily have prevailed <lb/>
              upon them: for, besides a lurking fear that Demosthenes was right, <lb/>
              they must have been somewhat ashamed of themselves for the <lb/>
              attitude of hostility which they had already assumed towards the <lb/>
              Phocians. But the punishment of their folly was at hand. On the <lb/>
              twenty-seventh day of the month the envoys, who had gone as far <lb/>
              as Chalcis in Eubœa, returned suddenly with the intelligence, that <lb/>
              Philip had declared himself the ally of the Thebans, and had given <lb/>
              up everything into their hands. The Athenians, who happened to be <lb/>
              in assembly at Piraeus when these tidings were brought, in the alarm <lb/>
              of the moment passed a vote to bring in all their women and chil­ <lb/>
              dren from the country, to repair their forts, to fortify Piræus, and <lb/>
              perform their sacrifice to Hercules in the city. This decree was <lb/>
              actually carried into effect; but the envoys were nevertheless sent <lb/>
              to Philip, and travelled by land through Bceotia, Æschines this time <lb/>
              going with them. The fears of the people were soon allayed by <lb/>
              finding that the allied powers had no thought of coming near Attica; <lb/>
              though perhaps their ill humour was increased by a letter which <lb/>
              came from Philip, calmly informing them of what he had done, and <lb/>
              reproving them for their demonstration of hostility.' <note type="footnote"> (1) Machines mentions only one letter: Demosthenes, two. The second may have <lb/>
              come soon after the first; or it may have been despatched after the capitulation of <lb/>

              some rouble to Philip, if the Athenians gave them any hope of support: though I <lb/>
              cannot credit the assertion of Demosthenes (De Fals. Leg. 879) that the Phocians <lb/>
              might In that event have been saved, owing to the impossibility of Philip'a finding <lb/>

               </p>
          <p>The Amphictyonic council, composed of the Thebans, Thessalians, <lb/>
            and their allies, proceeded to sit in judgment upon the Phocians. <lb/>
            Their first act was one of gratitude as well as justice. They de­ <lb/>
            prived the conquered people of their seat and votes in the council, <lb/>
            and transferred them to the king of Macedon and his descendants. <lb/>
            Their further sentence was, that the Phocian cities should be razed <lb/>
            to the ground, and the population of each dispersed into villages, <lb/>
            containing not more than fifty dwelling-houses, and at the distance <lb/>
            of not less than a furlong from each other. The Phocians were to <lb/>
            have no access to the temple of Delphi, and to possess neither arms <lb/>
            nor horses, but to be allowed to cultivate their land and take the <lb/>
            produce thereof, paying every year a tribute of sixty talents to <lb/>
            Apollo, until the whole of their plunder, estimated in value at ten <lb/>
            thousand talents, should be restored. Any guilty parties, whether <lb/>
            Phocians or auxiliaries, who had fled from justice, were declared to <lb/>
            be outlaws. All arms which had been used by the troops were to be <lb/>
            broken and destroyed; their horses to be sold. Regulations were <lb/>
            made for the future management of the oracle, for the establishment <lb/>
            of peace and amity among the Greek states, and the maintenance of <lb/>
            their common religion. The Spartans were excommunicated from <lb/>
            Amphictyonic privileges; and it was determined that Philip should <lb/>
            preside over the Pythian games in conjunction with the Thebans and <lb/>
            Thessalians.1</p>
          <p>Thus were the Phocians not only degraded from their rank as one <lb/>
            of the Amphictyonic communities, but reduced to become a mere <lb/>
            rural population, little better than the serfs of Thessaly. Their rank <lb/>
            they did not regain till many years after, when, by their valour in <lb/>
            repelling the Celtic invasion, they expiated the memory of their <lb/>
            former crime. One part of the sentence appears to have been in <lb/>
            violation of the engagement made by Philip with Phalæcus ; yet they <lb/>
            had enemies in the council, who would have inflicted on them a still <lb/>
            heavier punishment. Æschines says, the Œtæans proposed to cast all <lb/>
            the adult males down the precipice, and that he himself pleaded on <lb/>
            their behalf and saved them. The sentence however was rigorously <lb/>
            executed. Of twenty-one cities enumerated by Pausanias, Abæ alone <lb/>
            was spared, as having taken no part in the sacrilege: the rest were <lb/>
            destroyed; their walls at least and principal buildings were razed <lb/>
            to the ground, and the inhabitants driven to seek homes elsewhere, <lb/>
            according to the terms of the judgment. That the expulsion from <lb/>
            their ancient dwellings, the separation of friends, neighbours, and <note type="footnote"> (1) Diodorus, xvi. 60. Pansanias, x. 3. In the words of Diodorus, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τω̃ν δ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν <lb/>

            not be entirely demolished consistently with the oath of the Amphictyons, their <lb/>
            walls only were sentenced to be razed. See also Wesseling's note. </note> <note type="footnote"> x 2 </note> <lb/>

            relatives, must necessarily have been attended with great hardship <lb/>
            and suffering, is manifest. But the evil was aggravated by the pre­ <lb/>
            sence of an insulting and vindictive enemy. The work of destruction <lb/>
            was committed to the Thebans, who, occupying the country with <lb/>
            their army, in the licence of military power committed excesses of <lb/>
            cruelty, against which it was impossible to obtain redress and useless <lb/>
            to murmur. Large numbers of the people, chiefly men in the prime <lb/>
            and vigour of their life, emigrated to other lands. Demosthenes, <lb/>
            travelling through Phocis two or three years after, describes what he <lb/>
            saw with his own eyes; a dreadful scene of desolation; cities lying <lb/>
            in ruin, hardly any grown men in the country, a population consists <lb/>
            ing almost entirely of the old and infirm, women and children. Most <lb/>
            of the spoil that could be collected became the prize of Philip. But <lb/>
            the Thebans were permitted to annex some portion of the Phocian <lb/>
            territory to their own dominion. The Bceotian towns, Orchomenus, <lb/>
            Coronea, and Corsiæ, were delivered up to them; and the two former <lb/>
            they punished by enslaving the inhabitants. Yet the majority of <lb/>
            these avoided their doom by flight, and, together with a large number <lb/>
            of Phocian exiles, found refuge in Athens.1</p>
          <p>The allies of Philip thoughtlessly exulted in the vengeance which <lb/>
            they had inflicted on their enemies, and the advantages which they <lb/>
            had acquired for themselves. The Thessaliam, pleased with the re­ <lb/>
            storation of the Pylæan synod and the festival, little heeded that they <lb/>
            had found a new master. The Thebans, having recovered their lost <lb/>
            dominion in Bœotia and got an accession of territory, thought not <lb/>
            for the moment that it was at the expense of their honour and <lb/>
            credit, that their acquisitions were the gift of the king of Macedon, <lb/>
            and that they were to see a Macedonian garrison established at <lb/>
            Nicæa, a monument of his power and their own weakness. In fact, <lb/>
            the real advantages were Philip's, who had obtained an immense <lb/>
            increase both of power and reputation. His kingdom, but lately <lb/>
            regarded as semi-barbarous, now took her rank among the Amphic­ <lb/>
            tyonic communities. He was further honoured by the Delphians <lb/>
            with precedency in the consultation of the oracle-a distinction <lb/>
            formerly conferred upon Athens and Lacedæmon. But, what was <lb/>
            far more important, he had extended his alliances, enlarged the <lb/>
            sphere of his influence, and got the command of Thermopylae, which <lb/>
            gave him at any time an entrance to southern Greece. The Athe­ <lb/>
            nians, when all the mischief had been done, opened their eyes, and <lb/>
            saw how they had been duped and cheated. They made empty pro­ <lb/>
            tests and passed idle votes about the intrusion of barbarians into <lb/>
            the Amphictyonic council: they resolved to take no part in its <lb/>
            proceedings, and send no deputies to the Pythian games. Yet all <lb/>
            this had no other effect than to exhibit their ill humour, and irritate <note type="footnote"> (1) Pausanias, x. 3,8. Justin, viii. 5. Æschines, De Fals. Leg. 47. Demosthenes, <lb/>

            to Athens, requiring them to accept the acts of the congress as legal, <lb/>
            they dared not refuse compliance.1</p>
          <p>Phalæcus, having carried away what remained of the Delphian <lb/>
            plunder, maintained his troops for awhile in Peloponnesus; at length, <lb/>
            hiring a sufficient number of transports at Corinth, he embarked and <lb/>
            sailed for the Ionian sea, intending to cross over to Italy or Sicily. <lb/>
            There he hoped either to get possession of some city, or to find <lb/>
            military employment; for be had heard there was a war between <lb/>
            the Lucanians and the Tarentines; and he gave out that he had <lb/>
            been invited to go over by the natives. His soldiers however, when <lb/>
            they got into the open sea, observing that there was no envoy on <lb/>
            board from any foreign state, suspected that he was playing them <lb/>
            false, and mutinied; the principal officers came with drawn swords <lb/>
            to him and his pilot, and insisted that he should sail back to Pelo­ <lb/>
            ponnesus. He returned accordingly, and landed at Malea, the southern <lb/>
            promontory of Laconia; where he found an embassy from the Cnos­ <lb/>
            sians of Crete, who had come to enlist troops for a war against the <lb/>
            Lyctians. Phalæcus, receiving a large sum of money in advance, <lb/>
            consented to enter their service, and sailing with them to Crete, he <lb/>
            attacked and took the city of Lyctus. Just at this time there came <lb/>
            an unexpected auxiliary to the Lyctians, no less a person than <lb/>
            Archidamus, king of Sparta. It so happened, the people of Tarentum <lb/>
            had applied for succour to the Spartans, who, collecting a large force <lb/>
            for the defence of their ancient colony, gave the command to Archi­ <lb/>
            damus; but, before he had set sail, envoys arrived from Lyctus, and <lb/>
            prevailed on the Spartans to assist them first: Archidamus therefore <lb/>
            was sent to Crete, and, strangely enough, found himself opposed to <lb/>
            his old ally, Phalæcus, whom he defeated in battle and drove out of <lb/>
            the city of Lyctus. He then hastened to the relief of the Taren­ <lb/>
            tines, in whose cause some time afterwards he perished with his <lb/>
            whole army, fighting valiantly against the Lucanians. Phalæcus, <lb/>
            dispossessed of his former conquest, made an attempt on the city of <lb/>
            Cydonia, and brought up his battering engines; but ere they could <lb/>
            be applied, they were struck by lightning, and he himself and a <lb/>
            considerable number of the besiegers were consumed in the flames. <lb/>
            According to another account, Phalæcus was killed by one of his <lb/>
            own soldiers, whom he had offended. The relics of his army were <lb/>
            transported by some Elean exiles to Peloponnesus, where, in an in­ <lb/>
            vasion of Elis, they were signally defeated, and four thousand of <lb/>
            them taken prisoners. The Elean government divided the captives <lb/>
            between themselves and their Arcadian allies. Those allotted to the <lb/>
            Arcadians were sold into slavery ; the Eleans put theirs to death.2 <note type="footnote"> (1) Demosthenes, De Fals. Leg. 380, 381, 446: Philipp. ii. 74; iii. 119; iv. 148: <lb/>

          <p>Thus, says Diodorus, all parties who had been concerned in the <lb/>
            plunder of Delphi met with signal retribution from heaven. Even <lb/>
            the women, who had worn any of the sacred ornaments, came to <lb/>
            a miserable and shameful end. To the same cause he attributes the <lb/>
            calamities that afterwards fell upon Athens and Lacedæmon. Philip, <lb/>
            who vindicated the oracular temple of Apollo, continued (he says) <lb/>
            from that time forth to prosper more and more, till at length, as the <lb/>
            reward of his piety, he was elected generalissimo of the Greeks, and <lb/>
            established the greatest monarchy in Europe.1 Such was the strain <lb/>
            in which the fanatics and parasites of the day extolled the king of <lb/>
            Macedon. AEschines chimes in with it, discordant as it was with <lb/>
            the true interests of his country, and with the feelings which should <lb/>
            have animated every well-wisher of Hellenic happiness and freedom.2</p>

          <p>AEsCHINES, the second in reputation of Athenian orators, was bom <lb/>
            in the year B.C. 389, four years before Demosthenes. As to the rank <lb/>
            and character of his parents, different statements are made by him­ <lb/>
            self and by his opponent. According to his own account, his father <lb/>
            Atrometus was an honourable citizen, connected by birth with the <lb/>
            illustrious priestly house of the Eteobutadæ, who lost his property in <lb/>
            the Peloponnesian war; and, having been forced to quit Athens <lb/>
            during the government of the Thirty, served for a time as a merce­ <lb/>
            nary soldier in Asia, and on his return lived in reduced circumstances. <lb/>
            His mother, Glaucothea, was the daughter of a respectable Athenian <lb/>
            citizen. The account which Demosthenes gives of the parents and <lb/>
            early life of Æschines may be regarded in some measure as a carica­ <lb/>
            ture ; 3 yet it is not improbable, that the poverty, to which Æschines <lb/>
            himself admits his parents to have been reduced, compelled them to <lb/>
            earn their livelihood by somewhat mean occupations. Notwithstand­ <lb/>
            ing the disadvantage of early poverty, their three sons all raised <lb/>
            themselves to honour and dignity at Athens.4 That AEschines must <note type="footnote"> (1) Diodorus, xvi. 64. He should have gone on to say—"And two years after­ <lb/>

              have received a good education, is attested by the works which he <lb/>
              has left behind him; and it is possible that he may have owed this <lb/>
              to the very school which his father is said to have kept. While he <lb/>
              was yet very young, he obtained the situation of clerk to Aristophon, <lb/>
              one of the leading statesmen of Athens; afterwards he went into <lb/>
              the service of Eubulus, with whom he continued to be connected <lb/>
              for the rest of his life as a politician and a friend. Being gifted with <lb/>
              a handsome person and sonorous voice, he tried his fortune as an <lb/>
              actor; but in this profession, which was by no means dishonourable <lb/>
              at Athens, he appears, for some cause or other, not to have suc­ <lb/>
              ceeded.1 Like other Athenian citizens, he was called upon to perform <lb/>
              military service for his country, and he acquitted himself with honour <lb/>
              in several campaigns; more particularly at Phlius, at Mantinea, and <lb/>
              at Tamynæ. In this last battle he displayed such signal courage, <lb/>
              that he was chosen to carry home the news of the victory, and re­ <lb/>
              warded by the Athenians with a crown. Phocion, who had witnessed <lb/>
              his bravery, not only praised him on the spot, but honoured and <lb/>
              esteemed him ever afterwards. But the laurels which he earned as a <lb/>
              speaker soon threw into the shade those of the battle-field. His con­ <lb/>
              nexion with Eubulus procured for him the situation of clerk to the <lb/>
              popular assembly, through which he got an intimate acquaintance with <lb/>
              the laws, the politics, and the public business of his country. This he <lb/>
              found of immense advantage, when he came himself to take a part <lb/>
              in the debates; and it is no wonder, that with his powerful voice <lb/>
              and delivery, his literary acquirements, and great command of words, <lb/>
              he quickly obtained a prominent place among the orators of the day.</p>
          <p>The capture of Olynthus caused Æschines to come forward as a <lb/>
            strong advocate of warlike measures against Philip. The statements <lb/>
            of Demosthenes upon this subject-how he introduced Ischander to <lb/>
            the council; how he proposed the sending of embassies to rouse the <lb/>
            Greeks, and invite them to a congress at Athens; how he himself <lb/>
            undertook the mission to Arcadia, and discharged that duty with <lb/>
            zeal and ability-all are fully admitted by Æschines. How he <lb/>
            came to change his opinion, and to see the necessity of making peace <lb/>
            with Philip at that crisis, he himself gives a not unreasonable ex­ <lb/>
            planation: as to which, and as to the part which he took in the <lb/>
            embassy to Philip and the negotiation for peace, the reader is re­ <lb/>
            ferred to the preceding history of the Sacred War.2</p>
          <p>The circumstances attending the conclusion of this peace first <lb/>
            created hostility between Æschines and Demosthenes. The accusa­ <lb/>
            tion preferred by the latter against his rival brought them into an <lb/>
            antagonism, both political and personal, which never ceased till <lb/>
            AEschines finally quitted his native laud. The peace had been so <lb/>
            signally discreditable to Athens, and so manifestly injurious in its <note type="footnote"> (1). The sneers of Demosthenes are at the failure of AEschines, not at the pro­ <lb/>
            fession itself.</note> <note type="footnote">(2) See especially, pp. 284, 286—304. </note> <lb/>

            consequences, that in a very short time there was a strong reaction <lb/>
            in the feelings of the Athenian people, and the war-party recovered <lb/>
            their strength and popularity. Demosthenes stood forward as the <lb/>
            exponent of their views, and raised himself to the position, which he <lb/>
            had never occupied before, of a leading orator and governing states <lb/>
            man; while Æschines, having with difficulty obtained his acquittal <lb/>
            on the charge of treason, notwithstanding the influence of his friends <lb/>
            Eubulus and Phocion, withdrew for a considerable time from the <lb/>
            strife of politics, and was rarely to be seen on the platform of the <lb/>
            assembly. Besides other grounds of suspicion against him, the affair <lb/>
            of Antiphon, in which he was charged with being an accomplice, left <lb/>
            a stain upon his character; and he must have felt it as a deep dis­ <lb/>
            grace, when the court of Areopagus took upon itself to deprive him <lb/>
            of an honourable office, to which the people had elected him.1</p>
          <p>In the year B. c. 340 he appears again on the scene of public life, <lb/>
            as one of the Pylagoræ, representing his countrymen in the Amphio­ <lb/>
            tyonic congress. His conduct upon this occasion (whether by acci­ <lb/>
            dent or design, it is impossible to say) contributed to kindle a third <lb/>
            Sacred war, and bring on the fatal campaign of Chæronea. The <lb/>
            details of this are given in Appendix IX.</p>
          <p>Having on the trial of Ctesiphon2 failed to obtain a fifth part of <lb/>
            the votes, he quitted Athens, and lived in exile in Asia Minor, earn­ <lb/>
            ing his livelihood by teaching rhetoric. During the lifetime of Alex­ <lb/>
            ander he cherished hopes of returning to Greece. Upon the death <lb/>
            of that monarch he settled at Rhodes, where he lived peaceably for <lb/>
            nine years, and founded a school of eloquence, which afterwards, <lb/>
            under the name of the Asiatic, acquired considerable celebrity. It <lb/>
            was there that his scholars, hearing him recite his own oration against <lb/>
            Ctesiphon, expressed their astonishment at his having failed to get <lb/>
            the verdict. " You will cease to wonder," said he, " when you have <lb/>
            heard the speech of my adversary- is On another occasion, having <lb/>
            read both of the speeches to a Rhodian assembly, and that of Demo­ <lb/>
            sthenes, which he delivered with great energy, having excited the <lb/>
            admiration of all—“ What would you have thought," said AEschines, <lb/>
            "if you had heard the man himself !” Cicero tells this story, to <lb/>
            illustrate the importance of manner and address in speaking. “ Actio <lb/>
            in dicendo una dominatur. Sine hâc summus orator esse in numero <lb/>
            nullo potest; mediocris, hâc instructus, summos sæpe superare. <lb/>
            Huic primas dedisse Demosthenes dicitur, cùm rogaretur quid in <lb/>
            dicendo esset primum; huic secundas, huic tertias."</p>
          <p>Of Æschines and his contemporaries Cicero, in his treatises on <lb/>
            Oratory, speaks as follows:­ <lb/>
            " Si qui se ad causas contulerunt, ut Demosthenes, Hyperides, <lb/>

            Leland describes him thus</p>
          <p>“Æschines was an orator whose style was full, diffusive, and <lb/>
            sonorous. He was a stranger to the glowing expressions and daring <lb/>
            figures of Demosthenes, which he treats with contempt and ridicule. <lb/>
            But, though more simple, he is less affecting; and, by being less <lb/>
            contracted, has not so much strength and energy. Or, as Quintilian <lb/>
            expresses it, ‘ carnis plus habet, lacertorum minus.' But, if we would <lb/>
            view his abilities to the greatest advantage, we must not compare <lb/>
            them with those of his rival. Then will his figures appear to want <lb/>
            neither beauty nor grandeur. His easy and natural manner will <lb/>
            then be thought highly pleasing; and a just attention will discover <lb/>
            a good degree of force and energy in his style, which at first appears <lb/>
            only flowing and harmonious."</p>

            <title type="sub">ARISTOPHON.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>There are two persons of this name referred to in the orators: <lb/>
            Aristophon of Colyttus, and Aristophon of Azenia: though Reiske is <lb/>
            inclined to think they were the same person.</p>
          <p>The former has been already mentioned as having taken Æschines <lb/>
            into his service as clerk. He was a friend of Eubulus, and a poli­ <lb/>
            tician of the same party. Demosthenes mentions them in connexion, <lb/>
            as both desiring the Theban alliance.1</p>
          <p>Aristophon of Azenia was an older statesman, who took an active <lb/>
            part in Athenian politics for about half a century after the end of the <lb/>
            Peloponnesian war. He was an able speaker, and the author of many <lb/>
            new laws. One of them, passed soon after the expulsion of the Thirty <lb/>
            Tyrants, enacted, that no child should be deemed legitimate whose <lb/>
            mother was not a citizen. AEschines in the oration against Ctesi­ <lb/>
            phon says, that he was seventy-five times indicted for passing illegal <lb/>
            measures, and every time acquitted. He conducted the prosecution, <lb/>
            instituted by Chares, against Iphicrates and Timotheus, and pro­ <lb/>
            cured the condemnation of the latter. One of his last political acts <lb/>
            was the defence of the law of Leptines, B.C. 355.</p>

            sthenes. He was employed in various commands with Chabrias, <lb/>
            Iphicrates, and Timotheus, during the war with Sparta. In the year <lb/>
            B.C. 373 he joined Iphicrates in the prosecution of Timotheus, but <lb/>
            failed to procure a conviction. 1 He was inclined to favour the <lb/>
            Spartan connexion, and, having accompanied the envoys who nego­ <lb/>
            tiated the peace of B.C. 371, he made a speech before the Pelopou­ <lb/>
            nesian congress, which is reported at some length by Xenophon, and <lb/>
            which appears to have been much approved.</p>
          <p>Two years afterwards he supported the motion for assisting the <lb/>
            Spartans, when Epaminondas invaded Laconia. He was ruined by <lb/>
            the unfortunate affair of Oropus, having advised that it should be <lb/>
            put into the hands of the Thebans.2 For this both he and Chabrias <lb/>
            were brought to trial, B.C. 366. Callistratus made a splendid speech, <lb/>
            which was heard by Demosthenes, and is. said to have kindled in his <lb/>
            youthful breast the desire to become an orator. It was successful; <lb/>
            and Callistratus was acquitted. But the loss of Oropus rankled in <lb/>
            the minds of the Athenians; and five years afterwards he was tried <lb/>
            again, and capitally convicted. Notwithstanding the sentence, he <lb/>
            was allowed to withdraw into exile; and for some years he lived in <lb/>
            Macedonia or Thrace; but choosing to return to Athens without <lb/>
            permission from the people, he was arrested, dragged even from an <lb/>
            altar, and suffered the penalty of the law.3</p>

          </ab>
          <p>A general, contemporary with Demosthenes, whom during a period <lb/>
            of thirty years we find on various occasions commanding the Athenian <lb/>
            armies, more often to the disadvantage than the advantage of his <lb/>
            country. His first command was at Phlius, B.C. 367—366, when he <lb/>
            successfully defended that city against the Argives. In 361 B.C., after <lb/>
            Leosthenes had been defeated by Alexander of Pheræ, Chares was <lb/>
            appointed admiral in his room; but he soon did much greater mis­ <lb/>
            chief than his predecessor; for, sailing to Corcyra, he lent his aid to <lb/>
            a faction which overthrew the democracy, and which a few years <lb/>
            afterwards seized the opportunity, when the Athenians were dis­ <lb/>
            tressed by the Social war, to sever the island from their alliance. In <lb/>
            the campaign against the Thebans in Eubœa Chares held some com­ <lb/>
            mand, and was immediately afterwards sent to the Hellespont, where <lb/>
            he compelled Charidemus to surrender the Chersonese according to <lb/>
            treaty.4 Having thus acquired some credit, he was chosen to com­ <lb/>
            mand in the Social war. This was a series of disasters. He was <lb/>
            defeated in the attack upon Chios, where fell the gallant Chabrias. <lb/>
            In the second year of the war Iphicrates and Timotheus were asso­ <lb/>
            ciated with him in the command; but they were unable to obtain <note type="footnote"> (1) Ante, p. 251.</note> <note type="footnote">(2) Ante, p. 257. </note><note type="footnote"> (3) On the history of Callistratus, there is a learned note and excursus of Schneider, <lb/>

            any success against the allies, who with a superior fleet ravaged <lb/>
            Lemnos, Imbrus, and Samos, and levied contributions from the other <lb/>
            subject islands. To relieve Byzantium, which was besieged by the <lb/>
            Athenians, the allies advanced into the Propontis, and the two fleets <lb/>
            met; but a storm arising, the two elder generals thought it not pru­ <lb/>
            dent to risk an engagement: Chares, eager for battle, violently re­ <lb/>
            proached them, and afterwards wrote a letter to the people, accusing <lb/>
            them of cowardice and treachery. Iphicrates and Timotheus were <lb/>
            recalled, and afterwards brought to trial. Iphicrates with his son <lb/>
            Menestheus was acquitted; Timotheus was condemned to a fine of <lb/>
            a hundred talents, and retiring to Chalcis died in exile. The manage­ <lb/>
            ment of the war was left to Chares; who, though no longer restrained <lb/>
            by the presence of his colleagues, never ventured to attack the enemy <lb/>
            — (perhaps indeed they gave him no opportunity) — but carried his <lb/>
            troops over to Asia Minor, to assist the satrap Artabazus in his re­ <lb/>
            bellion against the Persian king. Having vanquished the royal forces, <lb/>
            he received his promised reward, a sum of money which enabled <lb/>
            him to maintain his army. But Artaxerxes having sent a wrathful <lb/>
            message to Athens, complaining of this attack upon his kingdom, the <lb/>
            Athenians, who at first had not been displeased at the assistance <lb/>
            rendered to Artabazus, ordered Chares to quit his service; and not <lb/>
            long afterwards, hearing that Artaxerxes was fitting out an armament <lb/>
            of three hundred galleys, and being quite unprepared for a contest <lb/>
            against such formidable odds, they concluded peace with the revolted <lb/>
            allies, and acknowledged their independence.</p>
          <p>Chares still commanded in the Hellespont, where it was necessary <lb/>
            for the Athenians to have a fleet constantly stationed, for the protec­ <lb/>
            tion of their Thracian settlements and of the corn-trade. In the year <lb/>
            355 B.C. he took Sestus. Polyænus relates a stratagem by which <lb/>
            Philip, having some transports to carry along the coast from Maronea, <lb/>
            contrived to elude the pursuit of Chares, who with a squadron of <lb/>
            twenty ships was lying in watch at Neapolis. Of his sorry perform­ <lb/>
            ances in the Olynthian war, and the inefficiency of his operations in <lb/>
            346 B.C., when Philip was attacking Thrace, I have spoken in the <lb/>
            preceding volume.1 We may presume indeed, that during all this <lb/>
            time he did some service by keeping Philip's squadrons at a distance, <lb/>
            by blockading his coast and intercepting his commerce.</p>
          <p>That Philip suffered injury in this way from the war, is asserted <lb/>
            by Demosthenes, and is probable enough. But the cruisers of Chares <lb/>
            were no less formidable to neutral and even friendly states than to <lb/>
            the enemy; and this from the same cause which took him away from <lb/>
            his duty to serve Artabazus, viz. the want of proper supplies from <lb/>
            home. His troops were chiefly mercenaries, levied partly by his own <lb/>
            exertions; and, in order to keep them together, he was obliged to <lb/>
            provide pay in the best manner that he could, which was too often by <note type="footnote"> (1) See pp. 246—249, 282, 283. </note> <lb/>

            forced contributions from the merchants, the Ægæan islands, and the <lb/>
            cities of Asia Minor.1 This practice, which in effect was a species of <lb/>
            piracy, suited the views of a man like Chares, for it gave him a more <lb/>
            absolute command over his troops, and made him in some measure <lb/>
            independent of his country; while the Athenians connived at it, <lb/>
            because it relieved them from taxes and contributions. Chares re­ <lb/>
            sided chiefly at Sigeum, while he kept up his influence at Athens by <lb/>
            means of the orators of his party, and by lavish distributions of <lb/>
            money.</p>
          <p>For his reception at Byzantium in the war of 340 B.C. I refer to <lb/>
            the last volume; 2 and for his performances in the campaign of <lb/>
            Chæronea, to Appendix IX. of this volume. Chares was one of the <lb/>
            Athenians whom Alexander required to be surrendered with Demo­ <lb/>
            sthenes. When Alexander crossed over to Asia, Chares was living <lb/>
            at Sigeum, and came to meet him at Ilium. Afterwards we read of <lb/>
            his seizing Mitylene, apparently on behalf of Darius; from which he <lb/>
            was expelled by Hegelochus the Macedonian general.</p>
          <p>The character of the man appears from the history of his public <lb/>
            life. He was a vain dashing officer, with a good deal of personal <lb/>
            bravery, but little strategic skill. He was too fond of luxury and <lb/>
            ease to perform his military duties properly. He used to carry about <lb/>
            with him on his expeditions music-girls and dancers and other <lb/>
            ministers of his pleasure. Funds which he received for warlike pur­ <lb/>
            poses he scrupled not to dissipate on idle amusement, or spend in <lb/>
            bribing the orators and jurymen at Athens. Such is the account of <lb/>
            Theopompus, perhaps a little overcharged; yet that it is true in the <lb/>
            main appears from other sources. According to Suidas, his bad faith <lb/>
            was so notorious, that the " promises of Chares " passed into a pro­ <lb/>
            verb. The influence which such a man acquired at Athens was owing <lb/>
            partly to the absence of able competitors, partly to the vice and cor­ <lb/>
            ruption of the day. Statesman and general were not united in the <lb/>
            same person, as in the time of Pericles. The general serving abroad <lb/>
            was connected with the orator who stayed at home; and they gave <lb/>
            to each other a mutual support. Thus might an indifferent com­ <lb/>
            mander be kept in his employment by party influence. Aristophon <lb/>
            was for some time the fighting orator who supported Chares at <lb/>
            Athens. We find Demosthenes in the second Olynthian censuring <lb/>
            this as a vicious practice, and pointing seemingly to Chares, though <lb/>
            not by name. After the peace Chares and his party joined Demo­ <lb/>
            sthenes, who was then confessedly the best orator of the day, and <lb/>
            had got the ear and confidence of the assembly. In the oration on <lb/>
            the Chersonese, Demosthenes somewhat excuses the irregular prac­ <lb/>
            tices of the generals abroad, and speaks indulgently both of Chares <lb/>
            and Aristophon. Yet of the faults of Chares we cannot doubt that <note type="footnote"> (1) One writer attributes the origin of the Social war to these very practices of <lb/>
            Chares. See Thirlwall's History of Greece, v. 218, 229. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) Vol. I. Appendix III. p. 296. </note> <lb/>

            he was fully conscious, though friendship may have tied his tongue. <lb/>
            He speaks with extreme caution, where he defends him against <lb/>
            Æschines in the Oration on the Embassy.1</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">DEMADES.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>A clever but profligate orator, who first becomes known to us in <lb/>
            the debate of 349 B.C., when he opposed the sending of succours to <lb/>
            Olynthus. From this time he attached himself wholly to the Mace­ <lb/>
            donian party at Athens, and received the pity first of Philip, and then <lb/>
            of Alexander. As a necessary consequence, he was an enemy of <lb/>
            Demosthenes, with whom he came into frequent collision in the <lb/>
            popular assembly. His politics were not more opposite to those of <lb/>
            Demosthenes than was the style of his eloquence. Demades was an <lb/>
            off-hand and facetious speaker, without art and cultivation, but with <lb/>
            great natural powers, pleasing often by his coarse wit and vulgarity <lb/>
            more than others did by their studied rhetoric. If the people chanced <lb/>
            to be in the humour for his sallies, which was no rare occurrence, he <lb/>
            was a match even for Demosthenes himself.</p>
          <p>It would appear, from the character given of him by Theophrastus <lb/>
            and Cicero, and by divers anecdotes which are related of him, that <lb/>
            Demades was capable of something better than levity and joking, <lb/>
            when he chose to exert himself; but his inordinate love of money <lb/>
            and pleasure rendered it impossible for him to be an honest manor <lb/>
            a good citizen.</p>
          <p>Among the sayings ascribed to him are the following:-</p>
          <p>Being told that his politics were unworthy of Athens, he said, <lb/>
            “ he ought to be excused, for he steered but the wreck of the com­ <lb/>
            monwealth." Being reproached for changing sides, he declared that <lb/>
            " he often spoke against himself, but never against the state."</p>
          <p>When the news of Alexander's death was brought to Athens, he <lb/>
            said, " he did not believe it; for if it were true, the whole world <lb/>
            must by that time have smelt his carcase."</p>
          <p>Diodorus relates, that after the battle of Chæronea Philip in a fit <lb/>
            of intoxication insulted his prisoners, and was rebuked by Demades <lb/>
            in the following terms: " Fortune, 0 king, has placed you in the <lb/>
            position of Agamemnon; are you not ashamed to act the part of <lb/>
            Thersites "--that he took the reproof well, and even honoured <lb/>
            Demades for his freedom; held friendly converse with him, and at <lb/>
            his persuasion released the Athenian prisoners without ransom. We <lb/>
            learn from Demosthenes, that he negotiated the terms of peace with <lb/>
            Philip.2</p>
          <p>Wnen Alexander demanded the anti-Macedonian orators, Demades, <lb/>
            for a bribe of five talents, undertook to save them. An assembly <lb/>
            being held to consider the question of delivering them up, Demades <lb/>
            moved an artful decree, by which the people, while they excused <note type="footnote"> (1) Ante, p. 219.</note> <note type="footnote">(2) See ante, p. 103. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="318"/>
            the orators, promised to punish them according to the laws if they <lb/>
            deserved it. The Athenians passed the decree, and chose Demades to <lb/>
            be the bearer of it to Alexander. He took Phocion with him; and by <lb/>
            their persuasion Alexander was induced not only to grant the required <lb/>
            pardon, but to allow the Theban exiles to be received at Athens.</p>
          <p>By the ascendency of Macedonia Demades acquired influence at <lb/>
            Athens, notwithstanding his notorious corruption, of which he made <lb/>
            no secret, while he squandered his wealth as infamously as he got it. <lb/>
            He succeeded Demosthenes as treasurer of the theoric fund, and held <lb/>
            the appointment for twelve years. It is related by Plutarch, that <lb/>
            succours would have been sent to the Lacedæmonians against Anti­ <lb/>
            pater, if Demades had not told the people, that they must then forego <lb/>
            the sum which he was about to distribute among them for a festival. <lb/>
            When Alexander claimed to receive divine honours from the Greek <lb/>
            states, Demades moved at Athens that the king's demand be com­ <lb/>
            plied with, and meeting some opposition, bade the people mind that <lb/>
            they did not lose earth, while they contested the possession of <lb/>
            heaven. His motion was carried; but, after the revolution which <lb/>
            followed Alexander's death, he was sentenced to a fine of ten talents <lb/>
            for being- the author of so base a decree. In the affair of Harpalus, <lb/>
            we find Demades coming in for his share of the plunder, and con­ <lb/>
            fessing it without scruple; his maxim being, never to refuse what <lb/>
            was offered him.</p>
          <p>During the Lamian war Demades was in disgrace; but when <lb/>
            Anti pater was marching upon Athens, he was again employed to <lb/>
            mediate for the people. Yet with all his powers of persuasion, <lb/>
            assisted by Phocion and Xenocrates, he could only obtain peace for <lb/>
            Athens, on the terms of her receiving a Macedonian garrison and <lb/>
            a new constitution, paying the cost of the war, and giving up Demo­ <lb/>
            sthenes and other obnoxious orators. To the last condition we may <lb/>
            presume Demades offered no' objection; for he immediately after­ <lb/>
            wards moved the decree which sentenced those men to death.</p>
          <p>After this disgraceful peace, Phocion and Demades were the two <lb/>
            leading citizens of Athens; the real governor being Antipater's <lb/>
            lieutenant Menyllus. Phocion preserved a moral, if not a politic <lb/>
            independence; while Demades was in every respect subservient to <lb/>
            his foreign patron. Antipater used to say, that of his two Athenian <lb/>
            friends, he could not get Phocion to accept any presents, and to <lb/>
            Demades he could never give enough. Demades boasted of the <lb/>
            source from which he got his supplies; and when he celebrated the <lb/>
            marriage of his son, observed that the wedding-feast was furnished <lb/>
            by princes. Yet all the liberality of Antipater did not satisfy him, <lb/>
            and he at length brought about his ruin by his own treachery. He <lb/>
            wrote a letter to Perdiccas, urging him to come and deliver Greece, <lb/>
            which he said was " hanging by an old rotten thread." The letter <lb/>
            fell into the hands of Antipater. It so happened, that Demades was <lb/>
            shortly after sent by the Athenians to Macedonia, to petition for the <lb/>
             <pb n="319"/>
            withdrawal of the garrison from Athens. Antipater, then in his last <lb/>
            illness, admitted him to an audience, and produced the letter. <lb/>
            Demades, having not a word to say in his defence, was led away to <lb/>
            execution.</p>

            <title type="sub">HEGESIPPUS.</title>

          <p>An orator of the war-party at Athens. He supported the Phocian <lb/>
            alliance. He defended Timarchus, and seems to have been greatly <lb/>
            disliked by Æschines and his friends, who gave him the nickname of <lb/>
            Crobylus, from the manner in which he braided his hair.1 He was <lb/>
            sent on the embassy to Philip in 343 B.C., to negotiate about the <lb/>
            restitution of Halonnesus, the amendment of the peace, and other <lb/>
            matters; on which occasion he gave such offence by his demands, <lb/>
            that Philip banished the poet Xenoclides from Pella for showing him <lb/>
            hospitality. He afterwards denounced Philip's conduct at Athens. <lb/>
            The extant oration on Halonnesus is generally attributed to him.</p>

            <title type="sub">HYPERIDES.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>One of the most distinguished Athenians who flourished in the <lb/>
            time of Demosthenes; with whom he was intimately connected, and <lb/>
            whom he supported in all his efforts to support the sinking cause of <lb/>
            Athens and of Greece against the king of Macedon. Though an <lb/>
            honest and generous politician, in his private character be was not <lb/>
            free from vice; and he was apt to display the violence of his passions <lb/>
            both in the assembly and elsewhere. In early life he received a good <lb/>
            education, having studied under Isocrates and Plato. Like Demo­ <lb/>
            sthenes, he prepared forensic speeches for other men; and he spoke <lb/>
            and published many excellent orations, of which but a few fragments <lb/>
            have come down to us. In style he was subtle and argumentative; <lb/>
            occasionally bold and striking in his figures ; yet, as Cicero says, very <lb/>
            unlike Demosthenes. His delivery wanted animation.</p>
          <p>Hyperides was one of the patriotic citizens, who equipped galleys <lb/>
            at their own expense, to carry troops to Eubcea, when the Thebans <lb/>
            invaded the island. We have seen that he impeached Philocrates <lb/>
            for his treasonable conduct on the embassy. After the battle of <lb/>
            Chæronea he exerted himself with Demosthenes to put the city in <lb/>
            a condition of defence, aud moved a decree, to restore the exiles and <lb/>
            the disfranchised, to enfranchise aliens, and give liberty to slaves who <lb/>
            fought in defence of Athens. For this he was indicted by Aristogiton, <lb/>
            and acquitted. A fragment of his speech is preserved :­</p>
          <p>" What is it you reproach me with ? Proposing to give slaves <lb/>
            their freedom ? I did so to save freemen from slavery. Restoring <lb/>
            exiles to their country ? I restored them, that no man might become <lb/>
            an exile. Not reading the laws which forbade this measure ? I could <lb/>
            not read them; for the arms of the Macedonians took away my <lb/>
            eyesight." <note type="footnote"> (1) Perhaps in the fashion mentioned in Thucydides, i. 6. </note> <pb n="320"/>
             </p>
          <p>He was one of the obnoxious statesmen whom Alexander de­ <lb/>
            manded to be given up to him with Demosthenes and Chares. The <lb/>
            affair of Harpalus caused a rupture between him and Demosthenes, <lb/>
            against whom he appeared as an accuser. When Demosthenes had <lb/>
            gone into exile, Hyperides was the leader of the anti-Macedonian <lb/>
            party at Athens; and after Alexander's death he and Polyeuctus <lb/>
            proposed the warlike measures that were undertaken for the libera­ <lb/>
            tion of Greece. When envoys came from Antipater, and praised the <lb/>
            mildness of his disposition, Hyperides answered, " We do not want <lb/>
            a mild master. Upon the death of Leosthenea, who was killed in <lb/>
            a sally from Lamia, Hyperides spoke the funeral oration in honour <lb/>
            of the slain; of which the following remarkable sentence is pre­ <lb/>
            served :—</p>
          <p>" If death is like the state of the unborn, these departed ones are <lb/>
            released from disease and sorrow and all the casualties to which <lb/>
            humanity is subject. But if, as we believe, there still remains in the <lb/>
            invisible world a sense of the divine goodness, none surely can <lb/>
            deserve it so well as those who have vindicated the profaned sanctity <lb/>
            of the Gods."</p>
          <p>The end of Hyperides is invested with the same melancholy in­ <lb/>
            terest as that of Demosthenes. After the submission to Antipater, <lb/>
            they were both, on the motion of Demades, sentenced to death; but <lb/>
            they had previously escaped to Ægina. Here Hyperides entreated <lb/>
            his old friend to forgive him for his unkindness. They then took <lb/>
            a last farewell; Demosthenes retiring to the island of Calauria, <lb/>
            Hyperides to Hermione, where he sought refuge in the temple of <lb/>
            Ceres. Both were soon to be hunted down by the bloodhounds of <lb/>
            the victor. Hyperides, dragged from his sanctuary, was carried to <lb/>
            Antipater, who ordered his tongue to be cut out, and his body to be <lb/>
            thrown to the dogs. His bones were afterwards obtained by one of <lb/>
            his kinsmen and carried to Athens to be buried.</p>

            <title type="sub">LYCURGUS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>An eminent statesman and orator, chiefly known to us as the <lb/>
            author of the speech against Leocrates, whom he prosecuted as a <lb/>
            traitor for having deserted his country after the battle of Chæronea. <lb/>
            The case is remarkable, as showing what sort of offences might be <lb/>
            construed as treasonable at Athens; and the whole speech well de­ <lb/>
            serves to be read.1 Leocrates was a man of some wealth, who, on <lb/>
            hearing of the signal defeat at Chæronea, packed up all his effects, <lb/>
            and sailed away to Rhodes, where he spread a report that Athens <lb/>
            was taken by Philip. After staying abroad for seven years he re­ <lb/>
            turned home, and resumed his post as a citizen, but was immediately <lb/>
            impeached by Lycurgus, brought to trial, and convicted. Thirlwall, <lb/>
            in the seventh book of his history, where this circumstance is <note type="footnote"> (1) See my article <foreign xml:lang="grc">Προδοσία</foreign>, in the Archaeological Dictionary. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="321"/>
            recoraea, gives an admirable description of the life and character of <lb/>
            Lycurgus, which I present somewhat abridged to my reader:­</p>
          <p>“Lycurgus, the prosecutor, was one of the few men then living <lb/>
            at Athens who could undertake such a task with dignity, as con­ <lb/>
            scious of a life irreproachably spent in the service of his country. <lb/>
            There are few Athenian statesmen of any age who can bear a com­ <lb/>
            parison with him. Phocion equalled him in honesty and disinterested­ <lb/>
            ness ; but in his general character, and in his political conduct, seems <lb/>
            to fall far below him. He was a genuine Athenian, his family being <lb/>
            one of the oldest and most illustrious in Athens. He traced the <lb/>
            origin of his house (the Eteobutads) to the hero Erechtheus. By <lb/>
            virtue of this descent his family possessed an hereditary priesthood <lb/>
            of Poseidon. In the Erechtheum, the temple dedicated in common <lb/>
            to the hero and the god, the portraits of his ancestors who had held <lb/>
            that office were painted on the walls. Lycophron, his grandfather, <lb/>
            had been put to death by the Thirty, and both he and Lycomedes, <lb/>
            another of the orator's progenitors, had been honoured with a public <lb/>
            funeral. Lycurgus had studied in the schools both of Plato and <lb/>
            Isocrates; but had not learnt from the one to withdraw from active <lb/>
            life into a visionary world, nor from the other to cultivate empty <lb/>
            rhetoric at the expense of truth and of his country. His manly <lb/>
            eloquence breathes a deep love and reverence for what was truly <lb/>
            venerable in antiquity. His speech against Leocrates, which is still <lb/>
            extant, shows that. he dwelt with a fondness becoming his birth and <lb/>
            station on the stirring legends of older times; but his admiration for <lb/>
            them had not made him indifferent or unjust towards those in which <lb/>
            he lived. He possessed an ample hereditary fortune; but he lived, <lb/>
            like Phocion, with Spartan simplicity. In an age of growing luxury <lb/>
            he wore the same garments through summer and winter, and, like <lb/>
            Socrates, was only seen with sandals on extraordinary occasions. <lb/>
            Yet he had to struggle against the aristocratical habits and prejudices <lb/>
            of his family. He was the author of a law, to restrain the wealthier <lb/>
            women from shaming their poorer neighbours by the costliness of <lb/>
            their equipages in the festive procession to Eleusis; but his own wife <lb/>
            was the first to break it. His frugality however did not arise from <lb/>
            parsimony, and was confined to his personal wants. He was re­ <lb/>
            proached with the liberality which he displayed toward the various <lb/>
            masters of learning whom he employed, and declared that, if he could <lb/>
            find any that would make his sons better men, he would gladly pay <lb/>
            them with half his fortune. He devoted himself to public life in a <lb/>
            career of quiet, unostentatious, but useful activity. He was a power­ <lb/>
            ful, but not a ready speaker: like Pericles and Demosthenes, he never <lb/>
            willingly mounted the bema without elaborate preparation; and his <lb/>
            writing instruments were constantly placed by the side of the simple <lb/>
            couch on which he rested, and from which he frequently rose in the <lb/>
            night to pursue his labours. But to shine in the popular assembly <lb/>
            was not the object of his studies; he seems only to have appeared <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> Y </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="322"/>
            there on necessary or important occasions. His genius was penu' <lb/>
            liarly formed for the management of financial affairs; and the economy <lb/>
            of the state was the business of a large portion of his public life. <lb/>
            In the latter part of Philip's reign he was placed at the head of the <lb/>
            treasury. The duties of his office embraced not only the collection, <lb/>
            but the ordinary expenditure of the Athenian revenues, so far as they <lb/>
            were not appropriated to particular purposes. On the administration <lb/>
            of the person who filled it depended both the resources of the state <lb/>
            and the manner in which they were regularly applied. The office was <lb/>
            tenable for four years ; a law dictated by republican jealousy, and (it <lb/>
            seems) proposed by Lycurgus himself, forbade it to remain longer in <lb/>
            the same hands. Yet Lycurgus was permitted to exercise its func­ <lb/>
            tions during twelve successive years, selecting some of his friends <lb/>
            for the last two terms to bear the title. In the course of this period <lb/>
            nearly 19,000 talents passed through his hands. He is said to have <lb/>
            raised the ordinary revenue from 600 to 1,200 talents. We hear of <lb/>
            no expedients but unwearied diligence by which he effected this <lb/>
            increase. It is only as to the application that we are more fully <lb/>
            informed. It seems that the amount and the nature of the domestic <lb/>
            expenditure were committed in a great degree to his discretion. As <lb/>
            the surplus not required for war fell into the theoric fund, which was <lb/>
            devoted to the transient gratification of the people, it required all the <lb/>
            influence of the treasurer to apply as large a sum as possible to <lb/>
            objects permanently useful. The administration of Lycurgus was <lb/>
            distinguished above every other since Pericles by the number of <lb/>
            public buildings which he erected or completed. Among his monu­ <lb/>
            ments were an arsenal, an armoury, a theatre, a gymnasium, a <lb/>
            palæstra, a stadium. After the example of Pericles, he laid up <lb/>
            a considerable treasure in the citadel, in images, vessels, and orna­ <lb/>
            ments of gold and silver, which at the same time served to heighten <lb/>
            the splendour of the sacred festivals. It was in a different capacity, <lb/>
            under a special commission, that he also built four hundred galleys, <lb/>
            and formed a great magazine of arms. He seems likewise to have <lb/>
            taken Pericles for his model in a continual endeavour to raise the <lb/>
            character and to refine the taste of the people. We find his attention <lb/>
            directed to important branches of art and literature. He was the <lb/>
            author of a regulation for the better management of the comic drama. <lb/>
            But he conferred a more lasting benefit on his country, and on a <lb/>
            posterity, by another measure designed to preserve the works of the <lb/>
            three great tragic poets of Athens. The dramas of Sophocles and <lb/>
            Euripides, if not of Æschylus, were still frequently exhibited : they <lb/>
            were acknowledged as the most perfect models of dramatic poetry; <lb/>
            but this did not prevent them from undergoing a fate similar to that <lb/>
            which has so often befallen the works of our early dramatists: they <lb/>
            were frequently interpolated and mutilated by the actors. Before <lb/>
            the invention of the press this was a serious evil, as it endangered <lb/>
            the very existence of the original works. To remedy it, Lycurgus <lb/>
             <pb n="323"/>
            caused a new transcript or edition to be made of them by public <lb/>
            authority, in many cases probably from the manuscripts of the <lb/>
            authors, and to be deposited in the state archives. The value of this <lb/>
            edition was proved by its fate. It was afterwards borrowed by one <lb/>
            of the Ptolemies to be copied for the Alexandrian library, and fifteen <lb/>
            talents were left at Athens as a pledge for its restitution. The king <lb/>
            however sent back the copy instead of the original, and forfeited his <lb/>
            pledge. By the decree of Lycurgus it was directed, that the players <lb/>
            should conform in their representations to this authentic edition.</p>
          <p>“ All these works attest the influence of Lycurgus, while they <lb/>
            show the spirit in which it was exerted. As the state entrusted him <lb/>
            with its revenues, so private persons deposited their property in his <lb/>
            custody. When a piece of ground was required for his new stadium, <lb/>
            Dinias, its owner, made a present of it to the people, with the extra­ <lb/>
            ordinary declaration, that he gave it for the sake of Lycurgus. His <lb/>
            testimony was sought as the most efficacious aid in the courts of <lb/>
            justice. He was once summoned by an adversary of Demosthenes. <lb/>
            Demosthenes said he should only ask, whether Lycurgus would con­ <lb/>
            sent to be thought like the man whom he befriended. He could <lb/>
            venture sharply to rebuke the assembled people, when he was inter­ <lb/>
            rupted in a speech by clamours of disapprobation. We bear but of <lb/>
            one case in which he may seem to have courted popular favour by <lb/>
            a deviation from his principles in the management of the public funds. <lb/>
            He had convicted a wealthy man of a gross fraud on the state in <lb/>
            the working of the mines at Laurium. The offender was put to death, <lb/>
            and his whole estate confiscated, and Lycurgus consented to dis­ <lb/>
            tribute the sum which it brought into the treasury among the people, <lb/>
            as the whole produce of the mines had been distributed before the <lb/>
            time of Tbemistocles. The general tendency of his measures, and <lb/>
            the impression produced by his character, were rather of an opposite <lb/>
            kind. He inspired a feeling approaching to awe by his antique <lb/>
            Spartan-like austerity, as he publicly avowed his admiration of the <lb/>
            old Spartan manners. When he was appointed to superintend the <lb/>
            police of the city, the measures by which he cleared it of rogues and <lb/>
            vagrants were deemed so rigorous, as to be compared with the laws <lb/>
            of Draco. On the other hand, one of his celebrated enactments <lb/>
            was a provision against one of the grosser abuses of the slave-trade, <lb/>
            by which it sometimes happened that free persons were sold under <lb/>
            false pretexts in the Athenian market.</p>
          <p>" The account, to which every Athenian magistrate was liable, was <lb/>
            rigidly exacted from one who filled such an office as Lycurgus dis­ <lb/>
            charged for twelve years in succession. He rendered one at the end <lb/>
            of each quadriennial period, either in his own name, or in that of <lb/>
            the titular minister for whom he acted. No flaw was ever detected <lb/>
            in his reckonings, and it appeared that he had on various occasions <lb/>
            borrowed between 600 and 700 talents for the public service. Still <lb/>
            he himself was not satisfied with the ordinary inspection to which <note type="footnote"> Y2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="324"/>
            his accounts were liable; he justly considered them as one of his <lb/>
            fairest titles to gratitude and esteem, and he therefore caused them <lb/>
            to be inscribed on a monument which he erected in the palæstra <lb/>
            founded by himself: and it appears that a considerable part of this <lb/>
            inscription has been preserved to our day. A short time before his <lb/>
            death, which seems to have a little preceded Alexander's, he directed <lb/>
            himself to be carried to the council-chamber, and challenged a fresh <lb/>
            scrutiny of his whole administration. The only person who came <lb/>
            forward to lay anything to his charge was one Menesæchmus, whom <lb/>
            he had prosecuted, and he now refuted all his cavils.</p>
          <p>" Crowns, statues, and a seat at the table of the Prytanes, had <lb/>
            been bestowed on him in his life. After his death he was honoured <lb/>
            with a public funeral, and with a bronze statue near the ten heroes of <lb/>
            the tribes, and the distinction he had enjoyed as a guest of the state <lb/>
            was made hereditary in his family."</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">PHOCION.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Phocion is one of the heroes of Plutarch, who has written a very <lb/>
            interesting life of him, in which however he greatly overrates his <lb/>
            merits as a politician. He was born of humble parents in the year <lb/>
            402 B.C., and lived to the age of eighty. During all this time he was <lb/>
            remarkable not only for an inflexible integrity of conduct, but for an <lb/>
            austere virtue and simplicity, exemplified in his manners, his dress, <lb/>
            and his whole style of living. His early habits had accustomed him <lb/>
            to the endurance of hardships; and the precepts of philosophy, which <lb/>
            he imbibed from Plato and Xenocrates, under whom he afterwards <lb/>
            studied, taught him to despise riches and other external advantages. <lb/>
            Partly on such account, partly by his valour in the field, and by <lb/>
            means of a fluent and natural eloquence, he became a favourite <lb/>
            with the people, was forty-five times elected to the office of general, <lb/>
            and on five occasions at least intrusted with important commands, <lb/>
            in all of which he was successful.</p>
          <p>At the battle of Naxos he served under Chabrias, and greatly dis­ <lb/>
            tinguished himself. Chabrias observed, that his courage was tempered <lb/>
            with prudence, a quality in which he himself was somewhat deficient, <lb/>
            and for want of which he lost his life afterwards in the action at Chios. <lb/>
            He selected Phocion to execute an important commission, that of col­ <lb/>
            lecting contributions from the islands, and offered him a guard of <lb/>
            twenty sail. Phocion said, if he was sent to enemies, the force was not <lb/>
            large enough; if to friends, one vessel was sufficient. Accordingly he <lb/>
            took a single ship, and managed things so well, that he gathered all <lb/>
            the arrears due from the allies. After the death of Chabrias, Phocion, <lb/>
            in requital of his kindness, took the utmost pains to reform the <lb/>
            morals of his son Ctesippus, but found him incorrigible.</p>
          <p>His first important command was in Euboea, when he carried <lb/>
            succours to Plutarch of Eretria against Callias of Chalcis, who had <lb/>
            received assistance from Macedonia. He found that Plutarch had <lb/>
             <pb n="325"/>
            deceived the Athenians with respect to the amount of support which <lb/>
            he could offer. His own force was small, and through the negligence <lb/>
            or treachery of his ally he was brought into a perilous position in <lb/>
            the plain of Tamynæ, where he was exposed to an attack by superior <lb/>
            numbers. He chose some rising ground, and fortified his camp. Some <lb/>
            of his men being mutinous, and straggling from the camp, he told his <lb/>
            officers not to mind them, as they would do him more harm than good. <lb/>
            When.Callias advanced with his Macedonian auxiliaries, some of the <lb/>
            Athenians were eager to charge: he told them to wait till he had <lb/>
            offered sacrifice; notwithstanding which, his cavalry and the Eubœans <lb/>
            rushed impetuously forward, but were speedily routed, Plutarch <lb/>
            being the first to fly. Callias, thinking the battle won, led his troops <lb/>
            in some confusion up to the Athenian lines, when Phocion, informing <lb/>
            his men that the sacrifices were propitious, gave the order for attack; <lb/>
            and his small band of infantry, falling with fury upon their enemies, <lb/>
            after an obstinate fight won the victory. Phocion afterwards ex­ <lb/>
            pelled Plutarch from Eretria, in which he established popular govern­ <lb/>
            ment, and secured it by a fort called Zaratra, which he occupied, on <lb/>
            a neck of land projecting into the channel. His successor Molossus <lb/>
            managed things so ill, that he was taken prisoner by the enemy; and <lb/>
            Eretna was lost to Athens. It fell soon under the tyranny of <lb/>
            Clitarchus, a creature of Philip.</p>
          <p>In the year 351 B.C. Phocion went to assist Evagoras in the expe­ <lb/>
            dition for the reduction of Cyprus, which in the following year was <lb/>
            reannexed to the Persian empire. In 343 B.C. his services were <lb/>
            required to secure Megara against the intrigues of Philip. He <lb/>
            marched rapidly to the city with a large body of Athenians, and <lb/>
            being welcomed by the Megarian people, he proceeded to fortify the <lb/>
            harbour of Nisæa and complete the long walls, thus bringing it <lb/>
            under the protection of Athens, and defeating the plot of Ptceodorus <lb/>
            to introduce Macedonian troops. In 341 B.C. he restored Eubœa to <lb/>
            his country, driving out the tyrants and the Macedonian garrisons <lb/>
            from Eretria and Oreus. And in the following year he achieved the <lb/>
            signal successes which preserved Byzantium and the Chersonese.1</p>
          <p>Seeing the warlike abilities displayed by Phocion, we cannot help <lb/>
            deeming it unfortunate that he was not oftener employed, and parti­ <lb/>
            cularly in the critical campaigns of Olynthus and Chæronea. Had <lb/>
            he been sent to assist Phalæcus in the defence of Thermopylae, the <lb/>
            destiny of Greece might have been changed. He does not appear to <lb/>
            have been entrusted with any important command until he was <lb/>
            forty-eight years of age. For the cause of this we must look partly <lb/>
            to his own unambitious temper of mind, partly to the politics of the <lb/>
            time. Phocion was not a party man: both in private and in public <lb/>
            life his views and his acts were independent: he did not command <lb/>
            the political influence, and he would have disdained to use the arts, <note type="footnote"> (1) See ante, pp. 32, 35, 37, 109, 209: and see Vol. I. pp. 107, 119, 128, 296, 297. </note> <lb/>

            which elevated such men as Chares to honours and dignities. He <lb/>
            was generally opposed to the war-party; and it was but natural that, <lb/>
            when they had the opportunity, they should select for the execution <lb/>
            of their measures the men who supported them. There is another <lb/>
            thing also to be noticed. Phocion was an orator as well as a general. <lb/>
            he is said to have been the last of the Athenians in whom those two <lb/>
            functions were united. He never made long speeches; yet he com­ <lb/>
            manded as much attention as any of those who mounted the platform. <lb/>
            He spoke with a pithy and sententious brevity, which comported <lb/>
            well with the gravity of his demeanour, and had the more effect on <lb/>
            account of the esteem in which his character was held. Without <lb/>
            being ill-natured or discourteous, he had a dry caustic humour, which <lb/>
            could administer very sharp reproof to those who, he thought, by <lb/>
            their folly or presumption, or by the dangerous tendency of their <lb/>
            argument, deserved it. Even Demosthenes feared him, and once, <lb/>
            when Phocion rose to speak, whispered to a friend—“ Here comes the <lb/>
            chopper1 of my harangues." Nor did he spare the people themselves <lb/>
            more than his competitors, but was constantly rebuking them for their <lb/>
            follies. He told them once, he had given them a great deal of good <lb/>
            advice, but they had not the wit to follow it. Yet for all that he was <lb/>
            a favourite with the assembly; for they respected his good qualities; <lb/>
            and they always liked a man who threw life into their debates.</p>
          <p>A great number of his sayings are preserved by Plutarch; among <lb/>
            them the following</p>
          <p>Chares rallied him in the assembly upon the gravity of his counte­ <lb/>
            nance : Phocion said, " My grave looks never hurt the Athenians; <lb/>
            but your mirth has cost them many a tear."</p>
          <p>Being asked in the theatre, why he was looking so thoughtful ? <lb/>
            “ I am considering," said he, " how to retrench something in a speech <lb/>
            I am about making to the people."</p>
          <p>Demosthenes said to him, " The Athenians will kill you some day <lb/>
            in one of their mad fits :” " And you," said he, " if ever they come <lb/>
            to their senses."</p>
          <p>His speech having been received with applause in the assembly, <lb/>
            he asked one of his friends, "if he had let drop anything silly or <lb/>
            impertinent."</p>
          <p>Being reproached for defending an unworthy man, he said, “ The <lb/>
            innocent have no need of an advocate."</p>
          <p>Aristogiton, a pettifogging orator, having been sentenced to a <lb/>
            heavy fine, requested Phocion to come and speak with him in prison. <lb/>
            His friends advising him not to go, Phocion said, " I know no place <lb/>
            where I would rather meet Aristogiton."</p>
          <p>He reproved the people for their rejoicing at Philip's death, say­ <lb/>
            ing, " Remember, the army that beat you at Chæronea is lessened <lb/>
            only by one man." <note type="footnote"> (1) <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κοπίς</foreign>. This illustrates the passage in the Oration on the Embassy (p. 450): </note> <figure type="illustration">

          <p>When Demosthenes was inveighing against Alexander, tnen before <lb/>
            the walls of Thebes, Phocion quoted the lines of Homer, in which <lb/>
            the companions of Ulysses entreat him not to provoke Polyphemus : <lb/>
            What boots the godless giant to provoke, <lb/>
            Whose arm may sink us at a single stroke?1</p>
          <p>It is necessary however to advert to the political character of <lb/>
            Phocion, as to which there is some difference of opinion. Mitford <lb/>
            regards him as the best of Athenian statesmen. Plutarch takes <lb/>
            but little notice of those faults which Thirlwall and Grote comment <lb/>
            on with not more severity than justice. Phocion as a statesman <lb/>
            neglected the duty, which as a general he would have been the first <lb/>
            to acknowledge; that of defending his country; defending her by <lb/>
            his foresight and his counsel; descrying the danger that was ap­ <lb/>
            proaching her, and advising the proper measures to avert it. He <lb/>
            either did not see the peril, or, when he did see it, he despaired of <lb/>
            safety. He gave up the game, while there was yet a chance of <lb/>
            winning it. This is proved even by the campaign of Chæronea, the <lb/>
            issue of which was doubtful, and might have been different, if there <lb/>
            had been abler commanders on the Athenian side. Phocion was <lb/>
            keenly alive to the faults of his countrymen, but he did not strive to <lb/>
            amend them: he was content to sneer and moralise, without endea­ <lb/>
            vouring to instruct or improve. Athens, with all her faults, was the <lb/>
            best governed of all the states in Greece, and secured the largest <lb/>
            amount of rational happiness to her citizens. She was worth pre­ <lb/>
            serving for the sake of Greece and of the world. It was an injury to <lb/>
            the cause of civilization and humanity, that such a state should be <lb/>
            overthrown by the brute strength of a semibarbarous power. Phocion <lb/>
            should have cooperated with those who laboured to save their country, <lb/>
            and not have thrown difficulties in their way. What Athens wanted <lb/>
            was the energy which animated her citizens of a former age, <lb/>
            and the military training and organization which gives efficiency <lb/>
            to an army. No man was better able than Phocion to advise the <lb/>
            Athenians upon these subjects; yet we nowhere find him exhorting <lb/>
            them to rouse from indolence and prepare for a struggle that was <lb/>
            inevitable. Tamynæ might have shown him that they were capable <lb/>
            of doing something if properly directed. Still he persisted in looking <lb/>
            at the dark instead of the bright side of things; and though he <lb/>
            always did his duty in the field, he damped the spirits of his country­ <lb/>
            men and fostered their apathy and idleness at home. His philosophy <lb/>
            was one-sided, not teaching him to be a good patriot as well as a <note type="footnote"> (1) Pope'a translation of the Odyssey, ix. 494, where the companions of Ulysses <lb/>

              good man. Even in his sayings we may discover an inclination to <lb/>
              be smart rather than just, to sacrifice truth occasionally to repartee. <lb/>
              When Demosthenes advised that Philip should be engaged in war as <lb/>
              far as possible away from Attica, Phocion said, " Let us not be so <lb/>
              careful about the place where we fight, as how to get the victory." <lb/>
              Here, as it appears to me, Demosthenes gave sound advice, and <lb/>
              Phocion's answer was not to the point. Demosthenes might have <lb/>
              said, " Yes; I am also for taking every possible means to secure the <lb/>
              victory; but still I think it safer to fight Philip abroad than at home. <lb/>
              Let us do this, and not leave the other undone." Phocion censured <lb/>
              the measures of Leosthenes which led to the Lamian war; and being <lb/>
              asked by Hyperides, when he would advise the Athenians to declare <lb/>
              war, answered, " When I see the young observant of discipline, the <lb/>
              rich ready to contribute, and the orators abstaining from plunder." <lb/>
              This was ill-timed.</p>
          <p>Phocion seems to have thought, like Isocrates, that Macedonian <lb/>
            ascendency was not inconsistent with the freedom of the Greek <lb/>
            states. Chæronea soon undeceived him. When Philip invited a <lb/>
            general congress to meet at Corinth, and Demades proposed that the <lb/>
            Athenians should join it, Phocion advised them to wait until they <lb/>
            knew what Philip would demand. Afterwards, when it was found <lb/>
            that Philip demanded of them a contingent of cavalry and ships, the <lb/>
            Athenians says Plutarch) repented that they had not followed <lb/>
            Phocion's advice. Yet it may be doubted, whether they would have <lb/>
            done any good by merely absenting themselves from the congress.</p>
          <p>In the debate upon Alexander's demand of the orators, Phocion <lb/>
            advised the people to surrender them, and urged the orators to yield <lb/>
            themselves up for the public good. We may credit the declaration <lb/>
            which Plutarch puts into his mouth, that he would have been equally <lb/>
            willing to resign his own life to ensure the safety of his country; <lb/>
            and yet it is painful to see Phocion recommending the sacrifice of <lb/>
            these distinguished men to his country's enemy. Of the relations <lb/>
            which existed between Phocion and Demosthenes we know but little. <lb/>
            They were opposed in politics; yet it does not appear that they were <lb/>
            enemies in private: not a word is ever uttered by Demosthenes in <lb/>
            disparagement of Phocion;1 and it is observable that three important <lb/>
            commands (upon the expeditions to Megara, to Eubœa, and to By­ <lb/>
            zantium) were conferred upon him after Demosthenes had acquired <lb/>
            political power. While we lament Phocion's mistaken views of duty, <lb/>
            we cannot suppose that he acted from any ill-will towards Demo­ <lb/>
            sthenes or his friends. He went with Demades on the deprecatory <lb/>
            mission to Alexander,2 and was most favourably received by that <lb/>
            prince, who is reported on that occasion to have said, " The Athenians <note type="footnote"> (1) Phocion appeared to support Æschines on his trial: he was, as we should say, <lb/>
            a witness to character. Demosthenes, where he alludes to his adversary's sup- <lb/>
            3, does not name Phocion, though he addresses Eubulus in language of strong </note><note type="footnote"> See ante, pp. 189, 207, 208.</note> <note type="footnote">(2) See ante, p. 318. </note> <lb/>

            must keep their eyes open; for, if anything should happen to me, <lb/>
            they alone are worthy to command."</p>
          <p>Alexander during the short time that he conversed with Phocion <lb/>
            conceived a great regard for him, and, after he had gone to Asia, <lb/>
            corresponded with him as a friend. In the letters which he wrote <lb/>
            after his conquest of the Persian kingdom he omitted the word <lb/>
            Greeting (the common form of salutation) to all persons whom he <lb/>
            addressed except Antipater and Phocion. He could not however <lb/>
            induce Phocion to accept any presents from him. To some officers <lb/>
            who brought him a hundred talents Phocion said—“ How comes it <lb/>
            that among all the Athenians I alone am the object of Alexander's <lb/>
            bounty ? " and being told, that it was because Alexander esteemed <lb/>
            him alone to be a man of honour and probity; " then," said be, " let <lb/>
            him allow me to continue so." Craterus was ordered to offer Phocion <lb/>
            his choice of four Asiatic cities: this also he refused. Alexander in <lb/>
            some displeasure wrote to say, that he could not regard a man as <lb/>
            his friend, who would accept no obligation from him; upon which <lb/>
            Phocion requested him to pardon four persons, who for some "offence <lb/>
            were in custody at Sardis; and accordingly they were set at liberty.</p>
          <p>When Alexander sent for the ships winch the Athenians had pro­ <lb/>
            mised to furnish, and some opposition was made in the assembly, <lb/>
            Phocion warned them to keep friendship with those in power, until <lb/>
            they had greater power themselves. It does not appear what part he <lb/>
            took upon the motion for deifying Alexander. When Harpalus came <lb/>
            to Athens, Phocion rejected his bribes, but dissuaded the giving him <lb/>
            up to Antipater. When the people were in excitement upon the first <lb/>
            news of Alexander's death, some saying it was false, others crying <lb/>
            out that it was true—“ Well," said ion, " if it is true to-day, it <lb/>
            will be true to-morrow and the next day; and we shall have time to <lb/>
            deliberate about it at our leisure."</p>
          <p>He opposed the Lamian war from the first, thinking the Athenians <lb/>
            would not have the means to carry it on. In the midst of their suc­ <lb/>
            cesses in the first year he disheartened them by his gloomy fore­ <lb/>
            bodings. Those who judge by the event have praised him; yet the <lb/>
            history of the war itself proves, in spite of all that Diodorus and <lb/>
            others have said to the contrary, that there was a very good chance <lb/>
            of success, and that the Athenians were fully justified in commencing <lb/>
            it. Had Phocion not shown so despondent a temper, he would pro­ <lb/>
            bably have been chosen to succeed Leosthenes as general of the <lb/>
            allied army; and his military talents might have produced a different <lb/>
            result. Once more only was he destined to lead his countrymen to <lb/>
            victory. He had dissuaded them (perhaps prudently) from invading <lb/>
            Bœotia, while the flower of their army was engaged in Thessaly. <lb/>
            But when the Macedonian fleet, having been victorious at sea, made <lb/>
            a descent at Rhamnus, and landed a large force which overran and <lb/>
            ravaged the country, Phocion mustered all that were capable of <lb/>
            bearing arms, and putting himself at their head, marched to the <lb/>
             <pb n="330"/>
            defence of Attica. Here again we find him, as in his younger days, <lb/>
            checking the too forward eagerness of his soldiers, and exerting him­ <lb/>
            self to keep them under command. Nor was this without effect. <lb/>
            The Macedonians were routed, and their general Micion was slain. <lb/>
            This was the last gleam of success which attended the Athenian <lb/>
            arms.</p>
          <p>When Antipater was approaching Athens with his victorious army, <lb/>
            Phocion, as we have seen already, was sent with Demades and Xeno­ <lb/>
            crates to appease him; but the only terms which he could obtain <lb/>
            were such as annihilated his country's independence. Athens was <lb/>
            deprived of the few insular possessions which Philip had left her. <lb/>
            She was forced to accept a new constitution, by which nearly two­ <lb/>
            thirds of her citizens were disfranchised. Many of them emigrated <lb/>
            to Thrace, where Antipater offered them an abode. Some of the <lb/>
            upper class were banished from the city. A Macedonian garrison <lb/>
            was established at Munychia, to overawe any malcontents that <lb/>
            might remain.</p>
          <p>Amidst all the calamities and disgraces which had fallen upon his <lb/>
            country, Phocion preserved his serenity of mind. He had survived <lb/>
            all that was great and noble in Athens. There however he lived, on <lb/>
            friendly terms with the Macedonian governor, Menyllus, with whom <lb/>
            be had been formerly acquainted: while he refrained from all opposi­ <lb/>
            tion to the ruling power, which then would have been useless, he <lb/>
            refused all the proffered favours of Antipater, as he had once refused <lb/>
            Alexander's. The influence which he could exert at Athens was <lb/>
            greater than at any former period, owing indeed as much to Menyllus <lb/>
            as to himself. Yet even of this poor consolation he was soon to be de­ <lb/>
            prived by the death of Antipater, which occasioned a new revolution.</p>
          <p>Antipater, before he died, had nominated Polysperchon as his <lb/>
            successor in the regency: Cassander, his son, prepared to contest <lb/>
            this appointment, and, among other precautions which he took to <lb/>
            secure his own power, sent his friend Nicanor to Athens, to receive <lb/>
            from Menyllus the command of the garrison. Menyllus, ignorant of <lb/>
            Antipater's death, resigned his charge immediately. Polysperchon, <lb/>
            to counteract the efforts of Cassander, drew up an edict in the name <lb/>
            of king Aridæus, Philip's son, making liberal promises in favour of <lb/>
            the Greek cities; and wrote a conciliatory letter to Athens, proposing <lb/>
            to restore the democracy. At the same time he sent troops under <lb/>
            his son Alexander to expel Nicanor from Munychia, and prepared <lb/>
            himself to follow with a larger force.</p>
          <p>The Athenians, beguiled by the regent's letter, were eager to get <lb/>
            rid of Nicanor and his garrison; and a plot was laid to seize him in <lb/>
            the Piræus, where he was invited to attend a meeting of the council <lb/>
            Nicanor, who was secretly collecting reinforcements to maintain his <lb/>
            position, attended the meeting, upon Phocion's undertaking to be <lb/>
            answerable for his safety; but hastily withdrew, upon receiving a <lb/>
            hint of his enemies' designs. Phocion was reproached by the Athe­ <lb/>
             <pb n="331"/>
            nians for not having seized Nicanor's person, as he might have done. <lb/>
            He asserted that there was no reason to suspect Nicanor of any <lb/>
            hostile intention; but this only aggravated the displeasure of the <lb/>
            people, when Nicanor, having received his reinforcements from <lb/>
            Salamis, surprised Piræus in the night. He then offered to lead his <lb/>
            countrymen against Nicanor, but they refused to follow him, and <lb/>
            soon afterwards, when Alexander appeared with his troops before the <lb/>
            walls, they deposed Phocion from his office of general.</p>
          <p>The Athenians had imagined, that Alexander was come to liberate <lb/>
            them from the garrison and to enforce the king's edict; but they <lb/>
            soon found themselves mistaken. Alexander was observed to hold <lb/>
            private conferences with Nicanor. It was suspected that they were <lb/>
            concerting measures together, and that Phocion, who had himself <lb/>
            had interviews with Alexander, was at the bottom of the scheme. <lb/>
            A number of exiles, who had followed the march of the Macedonian <lb/>
            army, had got admission to the city, and helped to inflame the people <lb/>
            against Phocion. One Agnonides accused him of treason: upon which <lb/>
            he with some of his friends fled to the Macedonian camp. Agnonides <lb/>
            persuaded the Athenians to send ambassadors with an accusation <lb/>
            against him to Polysperchon. Phocion was sent by Alexander with <lb/>
            a letter recommending him to his father's protection.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding this, Polysperchon, who had now advanced with <lb/>
            an army into Phocis, received him with the utmost rudeness; and, <lb/>
            when he was accused by the Athenian envoys, refused to bear any <lb/>
            defence. An uproar being occasioned by many of the Athenians <lb/>
            speaking at once, " Put us all into one cage," said Agnonides, " and <lb/>
            send us to Athens to try our quarrel there." This strange request <lb/>
            was after a while complied with; and Phocion and the other accused <lb/>
            parties were put in a wagon, and sent in chains to Athens under the <lb/>
            escort of Clitus.</p>
          <p>They were carried to the theatre, where the assembly was to sit in <lb/>
            judgment upon them. A vast crowd was gathered, consisting in part <lb/>
            of exiles, foreigners, and slaves. The exiles were peculiarly exas­ <lb/>
            perated against Phocion, because he had been the friend of Antipater. <lb/>
            Clitus read a letter from the king, which declared that he believed <lb/>
            all the prisoners guilty, but that he left their case to the free judg­ <lb/>
            ment of the Athenian people. The accusers charged Phocion with <lb/>
            being the author of all the evils which had fallen upon them since <lb/>
            the Lamian war; the overthrow of the democracy, the death and <lb/>
            exile of so many citizens, the yoke of the Macedonian garrison. It <lb/>
            was in vain that he attempted to speak. His voice was drowned by <lb/>
            clamour. " Athenians "-at length he exclaimed:—“ I myself plead <lb/>
            guilty: but what have these my friends done? ”—“It is enough”— <lb/>
            cried the people—“that they are your accomplices." Agnonides <lb/>
            moved, that they should decide at once by show of hands, whether <lb/>
            the prisoners were guilty; and if so, that they should be put to <lb/>
            death. The sentence of condemnation was unanimous. Torture <lb/>
             <pb n="332"/>
            was proposed; but even Agnonides declared, he could never consent <lb/>
            to treat Phocion in such a manner: and one honest voice was heard <lb/>
            to exclaim—“ You are right, Agnonides: for if we put Phocion to <lb/>
            the torture, what may you not expect ? "</p>
          <p>Four of the condemned persons were carried with Phocion to <lb/>
            execution. He was insulted as he passed along: one man spat in <lb/>
            his face: he turned to the archons and said—“ Will no one correct <lb/>
            this fellow's rudeness ? " He preserved his own calm composure to <lb/>
            the last, and endeavoured to cheer his companions. Being asked, if <lb/>
            he had any message to his son, be answered—“ Yes: tell him to for­ <lb/>
            get how the Athenians treated his father." Nicocles, who had been <lb/>
            one of his dearest friends, entreated that he might drink the hemlock <lb/>
            first. " Ah!" said Phocion; " of all the requests you ever made <lb/>
            tt:is is the most painful to me: but, as I never refused you anything, <lb/>
            I must grant this also." The executioner had not mixed hemlock <lb/>
            enough for all, and asked twelve drachms for a fresh supply: <lb/>
            “ What ?” said Phocion: " can't one die free of cost at Athens? "— <lb/>
            and he requested one of his friends to give the man his fee.</p>
          <p>Such was the end of Phocion. It was compared to that of <lb/>
            Socrates. It reminds one also of Sir Thomas More.</p>

            <title type="sub">THE COUNCIL OF AREOPAGUS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THIS council, so called from the Hill of Mars, where it held its <lb/>
            sittings, near the Acropolis, was a judicial and deliberative body <lb/>
            greatly esteemed at Athens. It was from time immemorial established <lb/>
            as a court of criminal jurisdiction, to trv cases of murder, maiming, <lb/>
            and arson. It sat in the open air, to escape the pollution of being <lb/>
            under the same roof with the guilty. In its proceedings the utmost <lb/>
            solemnity was observed. Both parties were sworn to speak the <lb/>
            truth; and the facts alone were inquired into, without appeals to <lb/>
            the feelings or oratorical display.</p>
          <p>The Areopagites used to be taken from the noble families of Attica. <lb/>
            But Solon introduced a new Jaw, that the Archons whose official con­ <lb/>
            duct had been approved should be members of this council for life. <lb/>
            At the same time he enlarged the power of the council, attaching to <lb/>
            it political and censorial duties, in order that with the council of five <lb/>
            hundred it might act as a check upon the democracy.</p>
          <p>In their censorial character the Areopagites kept watch over the <lb/>
            religion and morals of the city, maintained order and decency, looked <lb/>
             <pb n="333"/>
            to the education of the young, inquired how people got their living, <lb/>
            and checked riotous excesses and debauchery. They had power to <lb/>
            summon before them and punish offenders. They acted often from <lb/>
            their own personal knowledge without requiring testimonial evidence. <lb/>
            We read of their entering houses on feast days, to see that the <lb/>
            guests were not too numerous. Menedemus and Asclepiades, two <lb/>
            poor young men, were called before the council, and asked how they <lb/>
            could manage to live, when they spent all their days in idleness in <lb/>
            company with philosophers: they proved that every night they <lb/>
            earned two drachms by grinding at a mill; whereupon the council <lb/>
            rewarded them with a present of two hundred drachms.</p>
          <p>As a political body, it was their province to inquire into offences <lb/>
            against the state and report them to the people. If the public safety <lb/>
            required it, or if there was not time to wait for the ordinary course <lb/>
            of law, they could interfere summarily to avert threatened danger, <lb/>
            to prevent the consummation of crime, or bring the offenders to <lb/>
            speedy justice.</p>
          <p>For example: after the battle of Chæronea, when it was expected <lb/>
            that Athens would be besieged, the Areopagites caused certain men, <lb/>
            who were preparing to leave their country, to be seized and put to <lb/>
            death. So also, they put Antiphon to the torture and sentenced him <lb/>
            to death, although he had been dismissed by the popular assembly; <lb/>
            and they deprived Æschines, suspected of being his accomplice, of <lb/>
            an office to which he had been elected by the peopled</p>
          <p>Or the people might give a special commission to be executed by <lb/>
            the Areopagites. Thus in the affair of Harpalus a decree was passed, <lb/>
            directing them to investigate what had become of the treasure which <lb/>
            I that officer brought to Athens. They instituted a rigid inquiry, <lb/>
            searching the houses of the suspected parties; and then made a re­ <lb/>
            port, charging several persons with having received presents, and <lb/>
            among them, Demades and Demosthenes.</p>
          <p>Had not the council maintained a high character for justice, pru­ <lb/>
            dence, and moderation, it would have been impossible for such inquisi­ <lb/>
            torial and summary powers to have been tolerated in a free state like <lb/>
            Athens. That they were exercised generally to the advantage of <lb/>
            the people, and that public opinion supported them, appears from the <lb/>
            express testimony of Isocrates, AEschines, and other writers. Isocrates <lb/>
            in his Areopagitic oration contrasts the loose morals of his own time <lb/>
            with those of a former age, over which the Areopagus exercised a <lb/>
            greater control: he says, that it was the most esteemed tribunal in <lb/>
            Greece; that even bad men, when they became members of it, dis­ <lb/>
            carded their own nature, and conformed to the character of the <lb/>
            institution.</p>
          <p>In the time of Pericles the democratical party, of which that <lb/>
            statesman was at the head, looked with jealousy upon the council of <note type="footnote"> (1) See ante, pp. 56, 118, 181; and Vol. I. p. 168, note 3. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="334"/>
            Areopagus, on account of the support which they thought it gave to <lb/>
            the aristocratical or conservative interest: and they exerted them. <lb/>
            selves to bring it into discredit with the people, and to weaken its <lb/>
            authority. The opposite party, headed by Cimon, resisted this <lb/>
            attempt; and the poet Æschylus engaged his pen in the same cause. <lb/>
            The tragedy of the Eumenides is said to have been composed for the <lb/>
            express purpose of upholding the authority of the Areopagus. He <lb/>
            there shows how it was established by the tutelary goddess of <lb/>
            Athens; how its first sitting was appointed for the trial of Orestes, <lb/>
            pursued by the vengeful Furies for shedding his mothers blood; how <lb/>
            it pronounced his acquittal with the aid and sanction of the goddess; <lb/>
            how Orestes vowed for himself and his country eternal alliance with <lb/>
            Athens; and how Pallas declared, that the court and council, com­ <lb/>
            posed of the best and worthiest Athenian citizens, revered for its <lb/>
            wisdom and incorruptibility, should endure to all ages and be the <lb/>
            safeguard of the country.' The inference was that, instead of seek­ <lb/>
            ing to encroach upon the power of this solemn and awful tribunal, <lb/>
            the people of Athens ought to regard it with veneration, and main­ <lb/>
            tain it in all its integrity. However, notwithstanding this powerful <lb/>
            appeal and all the opposition of Cimon and his party, Ephialtes in <lb/>
            the year B c. 458 carried a decree, which to some extent abridged or <lb/>
            limited the powers of the council. The exact nature of the change <lb/>
            which he introduced is a matter of controversy. That the criminal <lb/>
            jurisdiction of the court was not interfered with, appears from the <lb/>
            testimony of Demosthenes, who in the oration against Aristocrates <lb/>
            says, that neither tyrants nor people had ever deprived it of that <lb/>
            jurisdiction, and that even the condemned had never complained of <lb/>
            its verdicts. That it still continued to exercise large and undefined <lb/>
            powers of an inquisitorial and political character, appears from the <lb/>
            examples above mentioned, occurring in the age of Demosthenes. <lb/>
            It is not unlikely however that some of the censorial functions of the <lb/>
            Areopagus may have been taken away altogether. But what is still <lb/>
            more probable is, that the Areopagites, as a political body, were <note type="footnote"> (1) See the Eumenides, 465 </note> <figure type="illustration">

              made accountable to the people for the proper discharge of their <lb/>
              duties. This would be a regulation perfectly just of itself, and in <lb/>
              accordance with the spirit of the Athenian constitution, which did <lb/>
              not permit the existence of any irresponsible functionaries. Under <lb/>
              the check of such a law, they would be more cautious how they in­ <lb/>
              terfered on ordinary occasions with the rights and liberties of their <lb/>
              fellow-citizens: but it would not prevent them from taking strong <lb/>
              measures for the public safety or advantage, when necessity re­ <lb/>
              quired it.1</p>

            <title type="sub">THE COUNCIL OF FIVE HUNDRED.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THE council or senate of five hundred was an executive and de* <lb/>
            liberative body, appointed to manage various departments of the <lb/>
            public business, more especially that which related to the popular <lb/>
            assembly. As established by Solon, it consisted of four hundred <lb/>
            members, a hundred from each of the four tribes into which the <lb/>
            Athenians were then divided: but when the ten tribes were substi­ <lb/>
            tuted by Clisthenes for the four, the number of councillors was raised <lb/>
            to five hundred, fifty being taken from each of the tribes. They <lb/>
            were annually chosen by lot—in Solon's time from the three first <lb/>
            classes only, but afterwards from the whole body of the people-with <lb/>
            no other restriction than that they must be genuine citizens on both <lb/>
            the father's and the mother's side, and of the age of thirty. To <lb/>
            ensure the legal qualification, the councillors elect underwent a <lb/>
            scrutiny. before the existing council, and if any one was rejected, <lb/>
            another was chosen in his room frum the same tribe. Having passed <lb/>
            the scrutiny, they took an oath to observe the laws and consult for <lb/>
            the good of the commonwealth. At the expiration of their year of <lb/>
            office they had, like all other functionaries, to render an account of <lb/>
            their official conduct to the auditors: and during the term any one <lb/>
            was liable to be expelled by his colleagues for misbehaviour.</p>
          <p>For the more convenient despatch of business, the tribes appor­ <lb/>
            tioned the year among them, and took the duties in rotation. The <lb/>
            council was thus divided into ten bodies of fifty men, who were <lb/>
            called Prytanes, or Presidents, and who for the time represented the <lb/>
            whole council. Their term of office was called a Prytany, or Pre­ <lb/>
            sidency. As the lunar year at Athens consisted of 354 days, it was <lb/>
            so arranged, that there were six Prytanies of thirty-five days each, <note type="footnote"> &lt;1) See Thirlwall's History of Greece. iiL 18,22; and Whiston's article on the <lb/>
            Areopagus, in the Archaeological Dictionary. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δοκιμασία</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="336"/>
            and four of thirty-six, the supernumerary days being assigned to the 1 <lb/>
            four last Prytanies. This was a little modified in intercalated years. <lb/>
            The turns were determined by lot. From the Prytanes again were <lb/>
            taken for every seven days of their term of office an executive com­ <lb/>
            mittee, called Proedri. They had an Epistates, or chairman, chosen <lb/>
            for each of the seven days, by whom were kept the public records <lb/>
            and seal.</p>
          <p>Besides the committee thus taken from the presiding tribe, the <lb/>
            chairman had to form a committee of nine councillors from the other <lb/>
            tribes, choosing one from each by lot. This mixed committee attended <lb/>
            all the meetings of the council and the assembly, and nothing could <lb/>
            be done without their sanction. The object of this regulation was, <lb/>
            to give the other tribes a check upon the presiding tribe. And it <lb/>
            appears that in later times the mixed committee performed the duties <lb/>
            anciently appropriated to the committee of the single tribe; which <lb/>
            was a better arrangement.1</p>
          <p>The council was to be, according to Solon's design, a sort of direc­ <lb/>
            torial committee, to assist the people in their deliberations, and to <lb/>
            guide and control their acts in assembly. It was their duty to dis­ <lb/>
            cuss beforehand, and also to prepare and draw up in proper form, <lb/>
            the measures that were to be submitted to the people, whether they <lb/>
            emanated from themselves, or were proposed by any private indi­ <lb/>
            viduals. This afforded some guarantee, that no ill-considered mea­ <lb/>
            sures would be brought before the assembly. The proposition to be <lb/>
            introduced, having received the sanction of the council, was called <lb/>
            a Prohouleuma, a decree or order of council, and when it was ratified <lb/>
            by the assembly, it became a Psephima ,2 or decree of the people. <lb/>
            Thus, as we have seen, Ctesiphon's decree in honour of Demosthenes <lb/>
            first passed the council, and afterwards the assembly. It would have <lb/>
            been impossible however, in a democracy such as that of Athens <lb/>
            became, to adhere to the ancient rule, which required every decree <lb/>
            moved in the assembly to have been first approved by the council. <lb/>
            This therefore was soon dispensed with. Amendments were proposed <lb/>
            during the discussion of a bill, which the people could adopt if they <lb/>
            pleased. And any citizen was at liberty to move a decree, upon first <lb/>
            applying to the committee of council, and either-getting them to pre­ <lb/>
            pare it for him, or obtaining their assent to it as prepared by himself. <lb/>
            The form of the ancient practice was thus still preserved; for every <lb/>
            motion was made through the council, though they might not actually <lb/>
            have formed an opinion of its merits. And if it appeared to the com­ <lb/>
            mittee of council, that any motion was objectionable, either in point <lb/>
            of form or on more serious grounds, they might refuse to bring it <lb/>
            before the assembly; for which refusal, if improper, they would of <lb/>
            course be responsible to the people. <note type="footnote"> (1) Such is the explanation of Schömann. De Comitiis, p. 84. Antiquitates Juris <lb/>
            Publici, p. 217. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) But the decree of the council was called sometimes <foreign xml:lang="grc">ψήφισμα</foreign>. </note> <pb n="337"/>
             </p>
          <p>It was the business of the Prytanes in general to convene the <lb/>
            popular assembly, and to give public notice of the business to be <lb/>
            transacted. Their committee attended with the chairman and pre­ <lb/>
            sided over it. They proposed the subject of discussion; caused to <lb/>
            be read by the usher any bill which had been proposed; permitted <lb/>
            the orators to speak; put the question to the assembly; and took the <lb/>
            votes.1</p>
          <p>Besides preparing questions for the general assembly, the coun­ <lb/>
            cil had a right to issue ordinances of their own, which, if not <lb/>
            set aside by the people, remained in force for the year. And some­ <lb/>
            times, for the sake of convenience, the people specially delegated to <lb/>
            the Council of Five Hundred, as they did to the Areopagus, extra­ <lb/>
            ordinary powers, which they could not have ventured to exercise of <lb/>
            their own authority. Of this we have seen an example in the case <lb/>
            of the embassy to Philip, when the council issued that order, which <lb/>
            Demosthenes complains of his colleagues for disobeying.2</p>
          <p>The executive duties of the council were very numerous. The <lb/>
            whole financial department of the administration was under their <lb/>
            control. They superintended the letting of the public revenues.3 <lb/>
            They exacted payment from the lessees, and had power to send <lb/>
            defaulters to prison. The collectors and receivers accounted to them <lb/>
            for the public monies. The treasurers of the revenue received the <lb/>
            monies handed over to them by their predecessors in the presence of <lb/>
            some members of the council. In every Prytany an account of the <lb/>
            revenue was laid by the council before the people.</p>
          <p>They had the charge of building a certain number of galleys every <lb/>
            year; and of rewarding those captains who had been most expeditious <lb/>
            in the equipping and launching of their vessels. It was their peculiar <lb/>
            duty, to see that the horsemen whom the city maintained were <lb/>
            properly trained and exercised, and their horses kept in good condi­ <lb/>
            tion. And they attended in some measure to the musters of infantry <lb/>
            and seamen.</p>
          <p>We have seen that the councillors of the year examined the coun­ <lb/>
            cillors elect as to their qualification for office. They bad also to <lb/>
            examine the archons elect, to see whether they were qualified by law, <lb/>
            and worthy in all respects to undertake that important magistracy. <lb/>
            Any citizen might come before them to show grounds of disqualifica­ <lb/>
            tion; and the council might hear arguments on both sides, and send <lb/>
            the case, if they pleased, to be determined by a court of justice. The <lb/>
            speech of Lysias against Evander is an example of a case of this <lb/>
            kind heard before the council. <note type="footnote"> (1) They were said—<foreign xml:lang="grc">χρηματίζειν</foreign> (to open the business of the assembly); <foreign xml:lang="grc">γνώμας <lb/>

          <p>Impeachments1 for any grave misdemeanours, which could not so <lb/>
            well be dealt with by the ordinary processes of law, might be pre­ <lb/>
            ferred to the council, who took cognisance of them in the first <lb/>
            instance, and could themselves impose a penalty not exceeding five <lb/>
            hundred drachms; but if the offence demanded a heavier punishment, <lb/>
            they had to bring it before the popular assembly or a jury.</p>
          <p>The council sat every day in the year, except holidays, for the <lb/>
            transaction of business. To the multifarious character of their oc­ <lb/>
            cupations Xenophon bears testimony in a remarkable passage in his <lb/>
            treatise on the Athenian republic, as follows:</p>
          <p>" I find some persons complain, that a man may wait a twelvemonth <lb/>
            at Athens before he can get an audience of the council or the people. <lb/>
            The fact is, they have so much to do at Athens, they are obliged to <lb/>
            send away some without hearing them. How could it be otherwise, <lb/>
            when they have more festivals to keep than any city in Greece, <lb/>
            during which it is not easy to despatch public business; and they <lb/>
            have more lawsuits, prosecutions, and audits, than all the rest of the <lb/>
            world P The council has a multitude of questions to consider, about <lb/>
            war, about supplies of money, about the passing of laws, about the <lb/>
            daily affairs of the city and those of their allies. They have also to <lb/>
            receive tribute, and attend to the arsenals and the service of the <lb/>
            temples. Is it at all wonderful, that, with so many occupations, they <lb/>
            are not able to transact business with everybody P"</p>
          <p>The council-chamber was open to the public, and strangers some­ <lb/>
            times attended to hear their consultations,2 but might be directed <lb/>
            to withdraw.</p>
          <p>To assist them, the council had two secretaries; one3 of whom <lb/>
            was chosen for each presidency, whose business it was to keep <lb/>
            the decrees and other records drawn up during that particular term; <lb/>
            and another,4 elected for the whole year, who had custody of the <lb/>
            laws. There was also a checking-clerk,5 whose especial duty it was <lb/>
            to take an account of the monies received by his employers. And <lb/>
            these doubtless had under-clerks6 to assist them.</p>
          <p>The members received two drachms a-day for their services, be­ <lb/>
            sides dinner at the public cost in the Prytaneum, or city-hall, which <lb/>
            was close to the council-chamber.7 During their year of office they <lb/>
            were exempt from military service: and, as a further mark of distinc­ <lb/>
            tion, principal places in the theatre were assigned to them. At their <lb/>
            meetings they wore a wreath of myrtle; and at the end of the year, <lb/>
            if they had given satisfaction, it was customary for the people to re­ <lb/>
            ward the whole body with a golden crown. <note type="footnote"> (1) <foreign xml:lang="grc">Εισαγγελίαι</foreign>.</note><note type="footnote"> (2) See an example, ante, p. 127. </note><note type="footnote"> (3) <foreign xml:lang="grc">Γραμματεὺς κατὰ Πρυτανείαν</foreign>.

            <title type="sub">THE POPULAR ASSEMBLY.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THE will of the sovereign people of Athens was expressed in the <lb/>
            Ecclesia, or Assembly. Here were brought before them all matters <lb/>
            which, as the supreme power of the state, they had to order or dis­ <lb/>
            pose of: questions of war and peace, treaties and alliances, levying <lb/>
            of troops, raising of supplies, application of the revenue, religious <lb/>
            ordinances, bestowing of citizenship and other honours, privileges, <lb/>
            or rewards: likewise, the revision of the laws, the election of a great <lb/>
            variety of magistrates and public functionaries, ambassadors or other <lb/>
            persons entrusted with special commissions; impeachments and in­ <lb/>
            formations for treason and high misdemeanours, which they either <lb/>
            determined finally themselves, or sent before a judicial tribunal. <lb/>
            Indeed, there was no question which could not ultimately be dealt <lb/>
            with by the assembled people, if they chose to exert their plenary <lb/>
            authority, though by the ordinary constitutional practice the duties <lb/>
            of the Ecclesia were pretty well defined.</p>
          <p>Anciently the people used to assemble once only in each Prytany, <lb/>
            or ten times a-year. After the democracy had grown stronger, and <lb/>
            t he business to be done by the whole people increased in magnitude <lb/>
            and importance, they met four times in each Prytany. These were <lb/>
            called the ordinary or regular assemblies.1 On what days they were <lb/>
            held, is not known; but it is thought they varied in the different <lb/>
            terms.2 The Athenians avoided meeting on holidays or unlucky3 <lb/>
            days. Assemblies however might be convened for other besides the <lb/>
            regular days, if any emergency required it. These were called <lb/>
            extraordinary.4</p>
          <p>The Assembly used anciently to be held in the market-place. After­ <lb/>
            wards it was transferred to the Pnyx,5 and at a later period to the <lb/>
            theatre of Bacchus. But it might be held anywhere, either in the city, <lb/>
            or the Piræus, or elsewhere. The Pnyx, which was the common <lb/>
            place of meeting in the time of Thucydides and Demosthenes, was <lb/>
            an open semicircular piece of ground, opposite the Areopagus. It was <note type="footnote"> (1) <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κυρίαι</foreign>, or <foreign xml:lang="grc">νόμιμοι</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) See Schömann, De Comitiis, chapters i. and ii.: Antiq.

            naturally on an incline; but to make it level, the lower end was <lb/>
            raised by a stone pavement.1 Here was the entrance for the peopled <lb/>
            The other end was skirted by a wall, from the centre of which pro­ <lb/>
            jected the Bema, or speakers platform, which was cut out of solid <lb/>
            rock3 ten feet from the ground, and to which there was an ascent by <lb/>
            eight steps. There were stone seats for the people next the wall, <lb/>
            and wooden benches in the middle.</p>
          <p>The assemblies were usually convened by the presidents of the <lb/>
            council, who published a notice four days before, specifying the day <lb/>
            of meeting and the business to be transacted.4 Extraordinary as­ <lb/>
            semblies were called by the generals. All citizens of the age of <lb/>
            twenty, who had been duly registered, were entitled to attend and <lb/>
            vote. In early times it was considered by the greater number of <lb/>
            them a burden rather than a privilege, as we may see by the regula­ <lb/>
            tions adopted to enforce attendance. A crier went round on the day <lb/>
            to collect the citizens. Those who absented themselves were liable <lb/>
            to a fine, which six officers called Lexiarchs were authorized to en­ <lb/>
            force. The police carried a rope stained with ruddle round the <lb/>
            market and other public places; with this they drove the idlers to <lb/>
            the assembly, or marked them if they would not go; at the same <lb/>
            time blocking up the passages, to prevent their getting away.6 To <lb/>
            encourage the attendance of the poorer citizens, a regulation was <lb/>
            introduced by Pericles, allowing a fee of an obol to those who came <lb/>
            early. This was afterwards increased to three obols. A ticket was <lb/>
            given to them on entrance, which entitled them afterwards to demand <lb/>
            their fee from the Thesmothetæ. The Lexiarchs took care, after the <lb/>
            business had begun, to keep the voters from coming out, and prevent <lb/>
            the intrusion of strangers.</p>
          <p>The assembly was presided over by the Proedri, that is, the com­ <lb/>
            mittee of the tribe in office, assisted by the mixed committee, as be­ <lb/>
            fore mentioned.7 They sat on the steps before the speaker's platform, <lb/>
            and maintained order among the people, with the assistance of the <lb/>
            police, who were at hand to remove either from the platform or the <lb/>
            seats any person who violated the prescribed rules, or offended against <lb/>
            decency or propriety. They had power to impose on the instant a <note type="footnote"> (1) Hence the name of the Pnyx, according to Suidas, <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρὰτὴν τω̃ν λίθων πυκνό­ <lb/>

              fine of fifty drachms: graver offences were referred to the council or <lb/>
              the next assembly. At a later period a further regulation was <lb/>
              adopted, owing to the outrageous conduct of Timarchus, who made <lb/>
              an assault with his fists upon some of those about him. A special <lb/>
              body of men was appointed for every assembly day, to sit in the <lb/>
              front benches, and assist the presiding councillors in keeping order. <lb/>
              Each tribe took its turn of making the appointment.1</p>
          <p>Before the business of the day commenced, a sacrifice of purifica­ <lb/>
            tion was offered. The lustral victims were young pigs, whose blood <lb/>
            was carried round and sprinkled on the seats,2 while at the same <lb/>
            time incense was burned in a censer. The crier then pronounced a <lb/>
            form of prayer and commination, imploring the gods to bless and <lb/>
            prosper the consultations of the people, and imprecating a curse <lb/>
            upon all enemies and traitors.3</p>
          <p>The chairman then opened the business of the day. If any bill <lb/>
            had been prepared by the council, it was read by the crier or usher, <lb/>
            and the people were asked if it met their approbation. If there was <lb/>
            no opposition, it passed. Any citizen however might oppose it, or <lb/>
            move an amendment. If the council had no decree framed by them­ <lb/>
            selves, any citizen might propose one on the instant: it was necessary <lb/>
            only that it should be in writing and in a proper form. He then <lb/>
            delivered it to the presiding committee, to be read as a motion to the <lb/>
            assembly; and if the committee saw nothing objectionable in it, they <lb/>
            complied with his request. Cases occurred, where some one or more <lb/>
            members of the committee opposed the reading of a motion, as being <lb/>
            either illegal, or grossly improper, or irrelevant to the question before <lb/>
            them. They were responsible however to the people, if they threw any <lb/>
            vexatious impediment in the way of a citizen moving a decree; and <lb/>
            sometimes the assembly itself would insist upon the question being <lb/>
            put to them, notwithstanding the veto of the councillors, Æschines <lb/>
            in his speech on the Embassy gives us an example. He says that <lb/>
            Aleximachus moved a decree, authorizing the deputy of Cersobleptes <lb/>
            to take the oath of peace to Philip ; that the decree was delivered to <lb/>
            the committee, and read to the assembly; that Demosthenes, being <lb/>
            one of the committee, got up and declared he would not allow the <lb/>
            question to be put; the people however were clamorous on the other <lb/>
            side, and he was obliged to yield.4</p>
          <p>Every member of the Assembly was at liberty to speak, but only <lb/>
            once in the debate. According to the institution of Solon, those <lb/>
            who were above fifty years old were first called upon, and afterwards <lb/>
            the younger men. But this custom fell into disuse. We find <lb/>
            Demosthenes alluding to it in the opening of the first Philippic. <lb/>
            Although all citizens had the right of speaking, the privilege was of <note type="footnote"> (1) Hence called, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ προεδρεύουσα</foreign> Schömann, De Comitiis, 88. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) Young pigs were considered by the Athenians to have peculiarly expiatory <lb/>

            course exercised by a few only, who felt themselves competent to the <lb/>
            task; and in the time of Demosthenes, when rhetoric was studied as <lb/>
            a science, the debates were mostly confined to a few practised orators <lb/>
            and statesmen, as they are generally elsewhere.1 Whoever rose to <lb/>
            speak, put on a wreath of myrtle, as a token that he was performing <lb/>
            a public duty, and entitled on that account to respect. It was a <lb/>
            breach of decorum to interrupt the speaker; yet one which it must <lb/>
            have been impossible to prevent, except where it proceeded from a <lb/>
            small number of persons. How Demosthenes was put down by the <lb/>
            clamours of Philocrates and others, he himself describes.2</p>
          <p>When the debate was ended, the chairman put the question to the <lb/>
            vote. The method of voting was either by show of hands, a or by <lb/>
            ballot.4 Show of hands was the most common. The ballot was re­ <lb/>
            sorted to in a few cases, where it was expedient to ascertain the <lb/>
            number of voters as accurately as possible, or to ensure secresy. <lb/>
            These were chiefly cases of privilegia, such as ostracism and con­ <lb/>
            demnation of state criminals, granting of citizenship or exemption <lb/>
            from taxes, or restoration of the franchise. In all those cases the <lb/>
            law required that there should be at least six thousand voters in <lb/>
            favour of the motion. Generally speaking however, the questions <lb/>
            before the assembly were decided by a majority of votes. The chair­ <lb/>
            man declared the numbers.5</p>
          <p>When all the business was concluded, the crier by command of <lb/>
            the presidents dismissed the assembly. If the business could not be <lb/>
            finished in one day, it might be adjourned to the next day, or to the <lb/>
            one after.6 This happened sometimes on a sudden shower of rain <lb/>
            or a thunderstorm. Anything of this sort was considered as an un. <lb/>
            lucky omen among the Greeks.7</p>
          <p>A decree having been carried by the votes of the people, it was <lb/>
            copied on a tablet, and deposited by the secretary among other public <lb/>
            records in the temple of Cybele.8 Sometimes it was engraved on <lb/>
            brass or stone, and set up in a conspicuous place, to be seen by all. <lb/>
            As to the form in which decrees were drawn up, the reader may con­ <lb/>
            suit Schömann.9 The mover's name was usually inserted, he being <lb/>
            responsible for the measure, as we shall presently see. <note type="footnote"> (1) Hence the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ῤήτορες</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">δημήγοροι</foreign> are distinguished from the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰδιω̃ται</foreign>, or general <lb/>

          <p>We have to distinguish between decrees and laws,1 in the Athenian <lb/>
            sense. Decrees are measures of government, relating to particular <lb/>
            matters or occasions; as for example, the election of magistrates, or <lb/>
            the punishment of offenders; a declaration of war, or a resolution to <lb/>
            make peace. They had indeed the force of laws for the time being, <lb/>
            so far as regarded the obedience due to them. But by laws we are <lb/>
            to understand the permanent institutions and ordinances of the <lb/>
            commonwealth, by which every man knows how he is governed, and <lb/>
            what are his franchises and rights. How these might be enacted <lb/>
            and repealed at Athens, is explained in a following appendix.</p>

            <title type="sub">THE OPINION OF POLYBIUS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>POLYBIUS, in the seventeenth book of his history, defends against <lb/>
            the attack of Demosthenes those Greek statesmen, especially of <lb/>
            Messene and Megalopolis, who took the Macedonian side in politics, <lb/>
            and dissuaded their countrymen from taking arms against Philip.2 <lb/>
            The passage is as follows :­ <lb/>
            "Demosthenes, deserving as he is. of praise in many respects, <lb/>
            must be condemned for the reckless and indiscriminate manner in <lb/>
            which he reviles the most eminent Greek statesmen; saying, that in <lb/>
            Arcadia Cercidas and Hieronymus and Eucampidas were traitors to <lb/>
            Greece, because they joined alliance with Philip; in Messene, the <lb/>
            sons of Philiades, Neon and Thrasylochus; in Argos, Myrtis and <lb/>
            Teledamus and Mnaseas: likewise in Thessalv, Daochus and Cineas, <lb/>
            and among the Bœotians, Theogiton and Timolaus. And besides <lb/>
            these, he has given a long list of others, with their names and <lb/>
            countries. Now all the above-mentioned statesmen have good and <lb/>
            ample grounds of justification for their conduct, but especially those <lb/>
            of Arcadia and Messene. For they, having invited Philip into Pelo­ <lb/>
            ponnesus and humbled the Lacedæmonians, gave repose and security <lb/>
            to all the inhabitants of the Peninsula: further, by recovering the <lb/>
            territory and towns, which the Lacedæmonians in their days of pros­ <lb/>
            perity had taken from the Messenians, Megalopolitans, Tegeans and <lb/>
            Argives, they unquestionably promoted the welfare of their countries. <lb/>
            So far therefore from going to war with Philip and the Macedonians, <lb/>
            they were bound to use every exertion to increase their honour and <lb/>
            glory. I grant, if at the same time they received a garrison in their <note type="footnote"> (1) <foreign xml:lang="grc">ψηφίσματα</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">νόμοι</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) The principal passages of Demosthenes will be found ante, pp. 23, 25, 29, 106, <lb/>
            109, 209. </note> <lb/>

            countries from Philip, or overturned the laws and deprived their <lb/>
            fellow-citizens of their rights and liberties, from motives of avarice <lb/>
            or ambition, they deserved the reproach cast upon them. But if <lb/>
            in the honest discharge of their duty as citizens they differed in <lb/>
            judgment with Demosthenes, not considering the interests of Athens <lb/>
            and of their own countries to be identical, surely he ought not to <lb/>
            have called them traitors on that account. Measuring everything by <lb/>
            the interests of his own commonwealth, and thinking that all the <lb/>
            Greeks should have looked up to the Athenians or else be stigmatized <lb/>
            as traitors, it seems to me, he has taken a very wrong and mistaken <lb/>
            view. My opinion is confirmed by the events that happened in <lb/>
            Greece, which show that the true foresight was exercised, not by <lb/>
            Demosthenes, but by Eucampidas and Hieronymus and Cercidas and <lb/>
            the sons of Philiades. For the Athenians by their contest with <lb/>
            Philip incurred signal disasters, being defeated in battle at Chæronea; <lb/>
            and, but for the king's magnanimity and regard for his own honour, <lb/>
            they would have suffered still more grievously than they did through <lb/>
            the counsels of Demosthenes; whereas those other statesmen en­ <lb/>
            abled the confederate Arcadians to enjoy perfect security against <lb/>
            Lacedæmon, from which their respective countries reaped many im­ <lb/>
            portant advantages.”</p>
          <p>If Demosthenes has been too severe upon the Greek statesmen, <lb/>
            Polybius has not been quite just to Demosthenes. Polybius, looking <lb/>
            at the state of Greece in his own time, argues as if the struggle <lb/>
            against Philip was desperate, forgetting that it was rendered so by <lb/>
            the very supineness and want of combination of which Demosthenes <lb/>
            complains. Had the Athenians been assisted at Chæronea by such <lb/>
            a force of Peloponnesians as afterwards battled with Antipater, <lb/>
            Greece might have been saved. Again :-the facts of the case are <lb/>
            not exactly as Polybius represents them. Messene and Megalopolis <lb/>
            were capable of defending themselves against Sparta without Philip's <lb/>
            protection. Even if it were not so, they but exchanged one master <lb/>
            for another. Though they might not feel the weight of his yoke <lb/>
            immediately, it was a yoke destined to gall them at no distant time. <lb/>
            The humiliation of Sparta was a poor consolation to freemen who <lb/>
            were humiliated themselves. The congress of Corinth and Philip's <lb/>
            victorious progress through Peloponnesus, are evidences to the world <lb/>
            that Grecian independence was gone. The Peloponnesians follow <lb/>
            Alexander to his wars, as they had anciently followed Sparta, but <lb/>
            less in the character of allies than of vassals. Alexander insults and <lb/>
            terrifies them by his edicts. A tyranny is established in Messena. <lb/>
            The Arcadians gain neither security nor repose by their fidelity to a <lb/>
            foreign potentate. Two bloody wars, and Megalopolis twice besieged, <lb/>
            first by Agis, and afterwards by Polysperchon, are the speedy and <lb/>
            bitter fruits of Macedonian protection; disproving the foresight <lb/>
            which Polybius claims for his countrymen.1 <note type="footnote"> (1) Polybius was a Megalopolitan. </note> <pb n="345"/>
             </p>
          <p>It is true, that grievous faults were committed both by Sparta and <lb/>
            Athens. Sparta should have abandoned her pretensions to Messenia <lb/>
            and her aggressive designs against her neighbours. Athens (not to <lb/>
            speak of other errors) missed an excellent opportunity of gathering <lb/>
            to her side a Peloponnesian confederacy, when the Megalopolitans <lb/>
            solicited her aid against Sparta in the year B.C. 353. She should <lb/>
            then have stood boldly forward, and declared that she would not per­ <lb/>
            mit Sparta to threaten the independence of her neighbours. This <lb/>
            was what Demosthenes advised. The Athenians chose a timid course, <lb/>
            which was not forgotten when she herself needed assistance. Un­ <lb/>
            fortunately the patriotism of the Greeks in general was too narrow, <lb/>
            and their wisdom too short-sighted, to perceive that the cause of <lb/>
            Athens against Philip was their own.</p>
          <p>Polybius himself, in reference to the conduct of the Messenians at <lb/>
            a later period, reasons more justly.1 Censuring generally that policy <lb/>
            which is determined to have peace at any sacrifice, he says the Mes­ <lb/>
            senians had been guilty of such an error; and the consequence was <lb/>
            that, although they escaped some trouble and danger for the time, <lb/>
            they incurred still greater misfortunes in the end. Having two <lb/>
            powerful people for their neighbours, the Lacedæmonians and the <lb/>
            Arcadians—the former of whom nourished an implacable hostility <lb/>
            against them, while the latter were their friends and well-wishers— <lb/>
            the Messenians did not meet either the enmity of the one or the <lb/>
            friendship of the other with a generous and brave spirit. When <lb/>
            their neighbours were at war, the Messenians kept aloof, and, as <lb/>
            their country lay out of the way, they were free from annoyance. <lb/>
            But when the Lacedæmonians had nothing else to do, they attacked <lb/>
            the Messenians, who had not the courage to resist bv themselves, <lb/>
            and through their system of neutrality were deprived of auxiliaries.</p>
          <p>He goes on to declare, that, if there should be a new revolution in <lb/>
            Peloponnesus, the only chance of safety for the Messenians and <lb/>
            Megalopolitans would be, to form an intimate union for mutual pro­ <lb/>
            tection, according to the original design of Epaminondas, and to <lb/>
            stand firmly and faithfully by one another in all difficulties and <lb/>
            dangers.</p>
          <p>Jacobs has expressed his opinion to the following effect, in the <lb/>
            preface to his translation of Demosthenes:— <lb/>
            "The patriotic feelings which inspired Demosthenes were not <lb/>
            equally felt by all the leading statesmen in Greece; but these feelings <lb/>
            did not allow him always to be just towards men, who, being placed <lb/>
            in different circumstances from himself, espoused a different line of <lb/>
            politics. He frequently complains of the number of traitors, who <lb/>
            sprang up like a crop of weeds in the states and cities of Greece, <lb/>
            and attached themselves to the interests of Macedonia. If the <lb/>
            words of the orator are to be taken in their literal sense, there must <lb/>
            have been such a depth of corruption among the Greeks, that heaven <note type="footnote"> (I) Lib. iv. 32, 33. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="346"/>
            itself could not have saved them. There can be no doubt that Philip, <lb/>
            in order to rule by division, availed himself of the party strife which <lb/>
            prevailed as well at Athens as in most of the other states; and that <lb/>
            e fomented it, both by his gold and by the skilful manner in which <lb/>
            he flattered the passions of the political antagonists. Even repub­ <lb/>
            lican Greeks were not insensible to the favour of a crowned head, <lb/>
            especially if polished speech and manner lent their influence to capti­ <lb/>
            vate them:1 and it is probable enough, that many men of the best <lb/>
            intentions were caught in this net, without being in the least degree <lb/>
            conscious that their acts were treasonable. Where party spirit pre­ <lb/>
            vails, the judgments of men are necessarily one-sided. Every man <lb/>
            thinks his own views alone are just, and looks upon one of different <lb/>
            sentiments as an enemy to the good cause for which he is striving. <lb/>
            That which at first is a contest of opinions becomes at length a con­ <lb/>
            test of passions; which in their zeal for the cause which they espouse <lb/>
            find an excuse even for lawless violence. So in relation to Athens <lb/>
            it appears to me, that what Demosthenes so vehemently denounces <lb/>
            as a crime is, in regard to many of the accused parties, to be viewed <lb/>
            in a milder light, as an error of party; and we would fain believe, <lb/>
            for the honour of the Athenian people, that the greater number of <lb/>
            the phiiippising citizens intended to render the best service to their <lb/>
            country. With reference to the friends of Philip in other states, <lb/>
            especially the Peloponnesian, whom Demosthenes stigmatizes as <lb/>
            traitors, the judgment of Polybius appears by no means unfair."</p>
          <p>He then cites the following remarks of Valckenaer:­</p>
          <p>" Proditorum atrum catalogum ex ingenio suo Demosthenes am­ <lb/>
            plificavit: nam inter illos, quos Atticus orator turpi hôc nomine <lb/>
            dehonestavit, fuisse credibile est, non pecunia sed humanitate regis <lb/>
            captos, qui hujus imperium anteponerent speciosse libertati quæ diCe­ <lb/>
            batur, et superbis dominis, plebi, quique plebem ducerent conciona­ <lb/>
            toribus."</p>
          <p>This is but a sorry defence for traitorous correspondence with the <lb/>
            enemy. Such arguments would justify any kind of treason. What <lb/>
            the philippising party gained by exchanging plebeian rule for Mace­ <lb/>
            donian, is shown by the fate of Demades and Phocion. <note type="footnote"> (1) Compare, Justin, ix. 8; who says of Philip—“ Blandus pariter et insidiosus <lb/>
            alloquio; qui plura promitteret quam præstaret: in seria et jocos artifex. Amicitias <lb/>
            utilitate, non fide colebat. Gratiam fingere in odio, instruere in concordantes odia, <lb/>

            <title type="sub">REVISION OF LAWS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THE enactment of laws (distinguished from decrees, as mentioned <lb/>
            in Appendix V.) was not left by Solon to the people at large, but <lb/>
            confided to a select body of them under an arrangement which has <lb/>
            drawn praise from many modern critics and historians. That wise <lb/>
            legislator was anxious to secure the stability of his institutions, <lb/>
            knowing that laws which have been consecrated by long usage are <lb/>
            more readily and cheerfully obeyed:1 while on the other hand he <lb/>
            foresaw, that the best constitution in the world might in course of <lb/>
            time require amendment and adaptation to existing circumstances. <lb/>
            Under the democracy which he created there would have been a <lb/>
            danger of exposing the laws to perpetual change, had it been left to <lb/>
            the multitude, upon the motion of any demagogue suddenly rising in <lb/>
            the Assembly, to make and unmake statutes at their pleasure. He <lb/>
            therefore so contrived matters, that, while his laws were subject to <lb/>
            constant revision, a check should be put upon crude and hasty <lb/>
            legislation.</p>
          <p>There were annually chosen by lot six thousand citizens, of not <lb/>
            less than thirty years of age, who formed a judicial court called He­ <lb/>
            liæa,2 and whose functions corresponded in great measure with those <lb/>
            of our jurymen. From them were taken not only the ordinary juries <lb/>
            for the trial of civil and criminal causes, but also a select body of <lb/>
            men called Nomothetœ, or law-revisors,3 to whom the people referred <lb/>
            all questions of legislation that came before them. And further, if <lb/>
            any new statute had been passed by these law-revisors, it might be <lb/>
            impeached before a jury taken from the same Heliastic body, who had <lb/>
            power to determine finally whether such statute should be abrogated <lb/>
            or confirmed. The method of proceeding was as follows:- <note type="footnote"> (1) This is a truth frequently enunciated both by ancient and modern philosophers. </note> <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_79_fig34.jpg"/></figure><note type="footnote"> (2) <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἡλιαία</foreign>(an assembly). The whole body were called Heliatœ. </note><note type="footnote"> (3) The term <foreign xml:lang="grc">νομοθέτης</foreign>(legislator) was given <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατἐξχὴν</foreign>to Solon. But it was <lb/>
              applicable to any individual who moved the passing of a law; and clearly the whole <lb/>
              legislative body might properly be so called. The court of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">νομοθέται</foreign>at Athens <lb/>
              was peculiarly constituted, having no power of originating laws, and being judicial <lb/>
              rather than legislative in our sense of the term ; and there was, in effect, an appeal <lb/>
              from them. They may aptly be styled revisers of the laws. </note> <pb n="348"/>
               </p>
          <p>It was a part of the business in the first ordinary assembly, which <lb/>
            was held on the eleventh of Hecatombæon, to consider the state of <lb/>
            the laws, and to receive proposals for their amendment. Any citizen <lb/>
            was at liberty to make such proposal, having previously obtained <lb/>
            leave from the council: but in order to ensure a constant revision <lb/>
            of the laws, the Thesmothetæ1 of each year were directed to examine <lb/>
            the whole code, and to see if there were any statutes contradictory, <lb/>
            or useless, or improper to be retained. The people heard whatever <lb/>
            proposal either these magistrates or any private citizen had to offer <lb/>
            for an alteration in the law; and if they deemed it worthy of further <lb/>
            consideration, they consented that it should be referred to a court of <lb/>
            revisers, and they elected five advocates2 to defend the old law <lb/>
            against the new one. A fair copy of the new law was put up before <lb/>
            the statues of the Heroes, a that every man might have an oppor­ <lb/>
            tunity of seeing it: and to give it still further publicity, it was read <lb/>
            aloud in every assembly before the revisers held their court. The <lb/>
            third of the ordinary assemblies (towards the end of the month <lb/>
            Hecatombæon) was appointed for the election of the revisers; of <lb/>
            which notice was to be given by the presidents of the council; and <lb/>
            the committee of council were directed (under severe penalties in case <lb/>
            of neglect) to consult the people as to the number of persons to be <lb/>
            elected, and as to their remuneration, duties, and term of office, <lb/>
            which of course depended chiefly upon the amount of business to <lb/>
            come before them. The number of the revisers was commonly about <lb/>
            a thousand; but it might be more or less.</p>
          <p>The various legislative questions referred by the people were tried <lb/>
            on particular days appointed for each. The revisers were impanelled <lb/>
            like a jury; though their court very much resembled a popular as­ <lb/>
            sembly, the presidents of the council being there as assessors, and <lb/>
            the committee presiding with their chairman. Arguments were ad­ <lb/>
            dressed to the court with the same formalities as upon a legal trial, <lb/>
            first by the supporters of the new law, next by the defenders of the <lb/>
            old; and to prevent collusion, any one might appear as defender, <lb/>
            besides the advocates specially chosen for that purpose. After hearing <lb/>
            all that could be said on both sides, the question was put by the <lb/>
            chairman, and the revisers decided by show of hands, whether the <lb/>
            old law should stand, or the new be accepted. Their judgment was <lb/>
            drawn up in the shape of a decree; and if the new law was passed, <lb/>
            it became forthwith a binding statute, subject however to be im­ <lb/>
            peached in the manner to be mentioned presently.</p>
          <p>Thus we see, while all law-making originated with the people, and <lb/>
            the humblest citizens were at liberty to propose new enactments, the <lb/>
            task of examining them at leisure, and considering all the questions <note type="footnote"> (1) As to this, see Schömann, De Comitiis, 259. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) <foreign xml:lang="grc">Σύνδικοι</foreign>,or <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϭυνήγοροι</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> (3) Called Eponymi, <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἐπώνυμοι</foreign>,because they gave name to the ten tribes.

            to which they might give rise, was delegated to a superior tribunal, <lb/>
            clothed with a judicial character, and more capable of exercising a <lb/>
            calm and deliberate judgment on such matters than the full assembly <lb/>
            of Athenian citizens.</p>
          <p>That the general scheme was due to the genius of Solon we are <lb/>
            expressly assured, though it is most probable that improvements were <lb/>
            made in the details since his time. And here it may be observed <lb/>
            generally with respect to the Attic laws, which are quoted by the <lb/>
            orators and attributed by them to Solon, that we must not suppose <lb/>
            all the extracts which they cite to be the actual words of the ancient <lb/>
            lawgiver: for not only did they receive additions and amendments <lb/>
            from time to time, but it is very likely, as Schömann suggests,1 that <lb/>
            when the code was remodelled after the expulsion of the Thirty <lb/>
            Tyrants, or possibly upon some other occasion, the antiquated phrase­ <lb/>
            ology of Solon's time was translated into the language of the day. <lb/>
            In a few years it would become difficult to distinguish, what part of <lb/>
            the code belonged to Solon, and what to a later period; and so the <lb/>
            whole body of statutes were, both by the orators and other persons, <lb/>
            commonly spoken of as the laws of Solon.</p>
          <p>Besides the regular time of holding the courts of revision, the <lb/>
            people might doubtless, if they pleased, appoint them to be held <lb/>
            on extraordinary occasions. One such occasion happened after the <lb/>
            expulsion of the Thirty Tyrants, who having abolished many of <lb/>
            Solon's laws and corrupted them by interpolations, it was thought <lb/>
            advisable to restore and remodel the ancient code; and a decree was <lb/>
            passed, authorizing the council to select a body of men to frame the <lb/>
            necessary amendments, and send them afterwards to be considered <lb/>
            by a court of revision in the usual way. We find Demosthenes in <lb/>
            his Olynthiac oration recommending the appointment of revisers, for <lb/>
            the special purpose of repealing the laws concerning the theoric <lb/>
            fund.2 One of the charges against Timocrates is, that he induced <lb/>
            the people to appoint revisers out of the usual time. For thus the <lb/>
            thing really stood :- It. was competent for the people to pass a decree <lb/>
            dispensing with the regular course of law; and it was impossible to <lb/>
            call them to account for it. But, as in our own country the maxim <lb/>
            that the king can do no wrong does not shield from responsibility the <lb/>
            minister who advises him, so at Athens the author of an unconstitu­ <lb/>
            tional measure was not protected by the fiat of the sovereign people <lb/>
            who decreed it. And this brings us to another important branch of <lb/>
            the subject, viz. the proceeding by indictment against the movers of <lb/>
            bad laws.3</p>
          <p>As a further precaution against rash legislation, a power was given, <lb/>
            after the passing of a law by the court of revision, to indict the author <lb/>
            of it at any time within a year, and thus to procure both his punishment <note type="footnote"> (1) De Comitiis, 267. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) See Vol. 1. p. 54; and Schömann, De Comitiis, 270 271. </note><note type="footnote"> (3) <foreign xml:lang="grc">Γραφὴπαρανόμων</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="350"/>
            and the repeal of the law itself. The law might be impugned either <lb/>
            for matter of form, as for the omission of some necessary step in the <lb/>
            procedure; or upon the merits, as being inconsistent with some other <lb/>
            lawthat was not repealed, or opposed to the general spirit of the <lb/>
            Athenian laws, or for any cause whatever mischievous in its tendency, <lb/>
            or adverse to the interests of the commonwealth. Any citizen was <lb/>
            at liberty to prefer an indictment against the author of a new law, <lb/>
            alleging it to be bad in any of these respects. The case was then <lb/>
            brought for trial before a jury, taken from the same Heliastic body, <lb/>
            who reviewed the law once more, examining it in all its bearings <lb/>
            upon the rest of the Athenian code and the general welfare of the <lb/>
            state. If they thought it open to the charges made against it or <lb/>
            any of them, they gave their verdict accordingly, pronouncing the <lb/>
            law to be bad and void, and sentencing the author to such penalty as <lb/>
            the nature of the case deserved. After the expiration of the year, <lb/>
            although the author could not be punished, the law itself might still <lb/>
            be impeached before a jury; but in such case the people appointed <lb/>
            advocates to defend it. Of this the oration of Demosthenes against <lb/>
            the law of Leptines is an example. The law, which prohibited all <lb/>
            exemptions from public services, was repealed, as being unjust and <lb/>
            derogatory to the dignity of Athens; but Leptines himself was safe <lb/>
            by the lapse of time.1</p>
          <p>The same proceeding might be instituted to rescind illegal or im­ <lb/>
            proper decrees, which had been passed in the popular assembly, and <lb/>
            to punish the movers of them. As there was a greater facility of <lb/>
            procuring decrees than laws, so, it appears, the indictments preferred <lb/>
            in these cases were much more numerous; and in impugning a <lb/>
            decree every possible ground of objection might be taken, in re­ <lb/>
            gard either to legality or expediency. Very frequently prosecution <lb/>
            was but a method of trying the question over again, or perhaps of <lb/>
            punishing the author for the evil consequences of his measure. We <lb/>
            nave seen that Aristophon was seventy-five times indicted for having <lb/>
            moved improper decrees, and every time acquitted. Cephalus, on the <lb/>
            other hand, boasted that he had never once been indicted.2 To pre­ <lb/>
            vent vexatious prosecutions, the accuser, if he failed to obtain a fifth <lb/>
            part of the votes, was liable to a fine of a thousand drachms, and was <lb/>
            rendered incapable of bringing any such accusation in future.</p>
          <p>Divers examples, illustrating this Athenian practice, are furnished <lb/>
            by the orators.</p>
          <p>Timocrates passed a law, allowing public debtors to be released <lb/>
            on bail. Diodorus indicted him on these (among other) grounds— <lb/>
            that he had not obtained the sanction of the council before he intro­ <lb/>
            duced his law to the people: that he had got the court of revision to <lb/>
            he appointed for the twelfth of Hecatombæon, immediately after the <lb/>
            first assembly, instead of waiting for the regular time, and that he <note type="footnote"> (1) See Vol. I. Appendix V. p. 307. Schömann, De Comitiis, 278—280. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) See ante, pp. 92, 3IS. </note> <lb/>

            had never put up his law in the usual way for public perusal: that it <lb/>
            was contrary to other existing laws: and that it was bad on the <lb/>
            merits. From the speech composed by Demosthenes in support of <lb/>
            the prosecution we get most of our information upon the subject of <lb/>
            the Nomotnetœ. And here we find him complaining of a practice <lb/>
            which had grown up, in contravention of Solon's regulation; whereby <lb/>
            legislative measures were brought before the popular assembly out of <lb/>
            the appointed time, and the people were persuaded to pass them in <lb/>
            the shape of decrees. It is clear, as I have before observed, that <lb/>
            the people could allow this to be done as often as they pleased: <lb/>
            public opinion alone could effectually check it, by insuring the con­ <lb/>
            demnation in a court of justice of the demagogue who misled the <lb/>
            assembly.1</p>
          <p>The case of Aristocrates, indicted for his decree in favour of <lb/>
            Charidemus, is a memorable example; of which I have spoken else­ <lb/>
            where.* But the most familiar of all is the prosecution of Ctesiphon <lb/>
            by Æschines; the grounds of which are fully explained in the argu­ <lb/>
            ment to the Oration on the Crown, and in the last appendix to this <lb/>
            volume.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>AFTER the battle of Mantinea Peloponnesus, as Demosthenes says, <lb/>
            was divided.3 Sparta could no longer domineer over her neighbours, <lb/>
            as she had used to do; yet her enemies were unable to crush her <lb/>
            entirely. The oligarchical states remained still attached to her- <lb/>
            Corinth, Phlius, Epidaurus, Trcezen, Elis, and the Achaian cities, <lb/>
            excepting Sicyon. But the powerful league, originally formed under <lb/>
            Theban protection, between the Messenians, Arcadians, and Argives, <lb/>
            maintained the balance of power in the peninsula. The independence <lb/>
            of Messene was acknowledged by the allies of Sparta at the general <lb/>
            peace of B.C. 362. Sparta herself protested against it, refusing to <lb/>
            accept as binding an arrangement by which she was humiliated and <lb/>
            degraded. For not only was the fairest portion of her territory, <lb/>
            which she had held for three centuries, taken away from her; 4 but <note type="footnote"> (1) Through this abuse (as Demosthenes says, Adv. Lept. 485,) <foreign xml:lang="grc">ψηφισμάτωνοὐδ</foreign>’ <lb/>

              she saw established on her confines a race of men whom she regarded <lb/>
              as slaves and rebels, dangerous from the implacable hostility which <lb/>
              they were sure to cherish against their late oppressors, and by the <lb/>
              encouragement which they held out for further revolt among the <lb/>
              Laconian Helots. But Sparta stood alone in her opposition, and <lb/>
              could only protest and wait for better times.1</p>
          <p>The feelings of the Spartan people upon this subject are pretty <lb/>
            well described in the oration of Isocrates, entitled Archidamus; <lb/>
            which was in fact a pamphlet published to vindicate the title of the <lb/>
            Spartans to Messenia, but is in the form of a speech addressed by <lb/>
            Archidamus, son of Agesilaus, to his countrymen, and seems to have <lb/>
            been composed on the occasion when Corinth, Phlius, and Epidaurus <lb/>
            seceded from the Spartan alliance, and made a separate peace with <lb/>
            the enemy, B.C. 366.2 The substance of his advice is as follows:-</p>
          <p>He contends that it would be disgraceful to let their revolted <lb/>
            slaves retain possession of their laud-the allies who urged them to <lb/>
            abandon it had given both weak and dishonourable advice-their title <lb/>
            to Messenia was unquestionable, being founded not only on length <lb/>
            of time, but on a valid gift, confirmed (as he shows from history) by <lb/>
            the Pythian oracle-the people who had been planted in Messene <lb/>
            were not real Messenians, but Helots and vagabonds—their own <lb/>
            cause was just, and they should defend it to the last-great things <lb/>
            had been effected by individual Spartans in the defence of other <lb/>
            cities, as by Brasidas at Amphipolis and Gylippus at Syracuse; they <lb/>
            should not then despair in the cause of their own country-the <lb/>
            sympathies of the Greeks would probably be with them; even the <lb/>
            democratized states of Peloponnesus would find they needed Spartan <lb/>
            superintendence, for they had got nothing by their defection from <lb/>
            Sparta but war and anarchy and intestine broils. Should their <lb/>
            enemies insist on such hard terms as the emancipation of Messenia, <lb/>
            and should the rest of the Greeks give their consent, then he advises I <lb/>
            his countrymen to remove their parents, wives, and children to Italy <lb/>
            or Sicily or Cyrcne or some other place of safety, to sally forth from <lb/>
            their home, as their ancestors had done in days of yore, to enter the <lb/>
            land of their enemies as an invading army, and there to seize upon <lb/>
            some stronghold, and commence a war of plunder and devastation, <lb/>
            until their enemies would be only too glad to purchase peace by the <lb/>
            restoration of Messenia. He argues that it would be impossible for <lb/>
            peace to be maintained on the basis desired by their opponents-that, <figure type="illustration">

              the settlement of the Messenians on their confines would lead to <lb/>
              perpetual quarrels and disturbances-that it would be such a degra. <lb/>
              dation as Spartans, accustomed to preeminence in Greece, could <lb/>
              never endure—that it might be well enough for Corinthians, <lb/>
              Epidaurians, and Phliasians, to care only for life and safety, but for <lb/>
              Spartans death was preferable to dishonour.1 How could they go <lb/>
              without shame to the Olympian and other national festivals; where <lb/>
              formerly every individual Spartan was received with as much honour <lb/>
              as the victors at the games, but now they would be looked upon with <lb/>
              scorn; their revolted slaves would bring from the land which their <lb/>
              fathers had bequeathed to them richer offerings than they did, and <lb/>
              would insult them in revenge for their past sufferings ? From such dis. <lb/>
              grace he calls upon them to rescue their country ; to struggle through <lb/>
              their present difficulties, as the Athenians and Thebans had out of <lb/>
              theirs; and lastly, to remember that they had never been defeated, <lb/>
              when a king of his line had commanded them.</p>
          <p>This singular pamphlet, which the renewal of friendship between <lb/>
            Sparta and Athens encouraged Isocrates to publish, produced but <lb/>
            little effect. It served as a manifesto to the Grecian world of the <lb/>
            feeling, which for many years continued to animate the Spartans; but <lb/>
            the coalition against them at this time was too strong to heed any of <lb/>
            their threats, much less the desperate one contained in the pamphlet.</p>
          <p>The emancipation of Messenia was not the only cause of discon­ <lb/>
            tent at Lacedæmon. The Arcadians from attached allies had been <lb/>
            converted into jealous and hostile neighbours, and were the more <lb/>
            likely to continue so on account of the political revolution which <lb/>
            they had undergone. The aristocracies, which had maintained them­ <lb/>
            selves in their respective cities by Spartan influence, and secured the <lb/>
            connexion of their country with Sparta, had been broken up or re­ <lb/>
            duced to insignificance by the establishment of Megalopolis. To <lb/>
            form this new city, designed to be the capital of the united Arcadians, <lb/>
            and their barrier against the aggression of Sparta, a population was <lb/>
            drawn from forty different communities, chiefly those bordering on <lb/>
            Laconia. Of the smaller towns which contributed, some were <lb/>
            deserted, others were reduced to villages. The larger cities were left <lb/>
            in possession of their local governments, which for ordinary purposes <lb/>
            they carried on as before, but they were required to send deputies to <lb/>
            a federal congress held in the capital, which exercised a controlling <lb/>
            power over all the concerns of the union, and represented the whole <lb/>
            Arcadian body in their transactions with foreign states. Of the for­ <lb/>
            mation of this congress we know little more than that it was of a <lb/>
            democratical character, consisting altogether of ten thousand mem­ <lb/>
            bers sent by the various constituents. From hence it took its name <lb/>
            and was called The Ten-thousand.2 Heræa and Orchomenus were <note type="footnote"> (1) This passage reminds me of a similar one in Demosthenes, De Synt. 176. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) <foreign xml:lang="grc">Οἱμύριοι</foreign>;and also TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">κοινὸνΤ</foreign>fi,lo" 'Apuddcov.

            the only cities which refused to join the union. Tegea had at first <lb/>
            opposed it, but through a revolution effected by the popular party <lb/>
            she was brought over to the other side. This was a great blow to <lb/>
            Sparta: for Tegea had been one of her warmest adherents, and was <lb/>
            near to the north-eastern frontier of Laconia. Megalopolis was not <lb/>
            far from the north-western: so that Sparta was cut off from her <lb/>
            friends in both of those directions.l</p>
          <p>In the year 363 B.C. dissensions arose in the Arcadian congress, <lb/>
            chiefly through the mutual jealousies of the leading cities, though <lb/>
            the immediate cause of dispute was concerning the Olympian treasure <lb/>
            which had been taken by the army. An aristocratical party sprang <lb/>
            up, adverse both to the federal union and to the Theban alliance. The <lb/>
            Mantineans, notwithstanding the zeal with which they had originally <lb/>
            promoted the union, took the lead in a counter-movement which <lb/>
            would have dissolved it, and sought to renew their connexion with the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonialls, by whom their city had formerly been destroyed. <lb/>
            It was owing to the measures taken by this party that Epaminondas <lb/>
            led his army for the last time into Peloponnesus, the effect of which <lb/>
            was 'to check the counter-revolution attempted in Arcadia, though the <lb/>
            death of that great man prevented the completion of any further <lb/>
            designs which he may have had for the settlement of Peloponnesian <lb/>
            affairs.'</p>
          <p>In the year following however the disturbances in Arcadia were <lb/>
            renewed. Some of the families who had been settled in Megalopolis <lb/>
            became dissatisfied with their change of residence; and taking <lb/>
            advantage of a clause in the general peace, which ordered all parties <lb/>
            to return to their respective countries, (a clause evidently framed <lb/>
            with a different view,) they chose to migrate from the capital to their <lb/>
            ancient towns. The Megalopolitan government insisted that they <lb/>
            should come back: upon which they applied for aid to the Mantineans <lb/>
            and other Peloponnesians who had assisted them in the late war. <lb/>
            Theban intervention again became necessary; and Pammenes was sent <lb/>
            with three thousand foot and three hundred horse to Arcadia. He <lb/>
            reduced the malcontents to submission, but not till he had besieged <lb/>
            and taken some of their towns; after which they returned quietly to <lb/>
            Megalopolis, and the dissensions were appeased. a</p>
          <p>In the last movement Sparta had not interfered. Her losses in <lb/>
            the war with Thebes had greatly exhausted her. To recruit the <lb/>
            finances of his country, Agesilaus at the age of eighty went over to <lb/>
            and engaged in the service first of Tachos, afterwards of <lb/>
            Nectallabis, whom he established on the throne, and received a re­ <lb/>
            compense of two hundred and thirty talents. On his return home <note type="footnote"> (1) Xenophon, Hellen. vi. c. 5, as. 6—11, 22. Diodorus, xv. 59, 72. Pau san iut <lb/>

            lie was taken ill and died on the coast of Africa.1 The money was <lb/>
            doubtless acceptable at Sparta: yet for the present she was not <lb/>
            strong enough to attempt any hostile measures against her neigh­ <lb/>
            bours ; nor did she receive the least encouragement to do so from <lb/>
            her old allies, who were anxious only for neutrality and repose. For <lb/>
            nine years after the battle of Mantinea the Peloponnesians enjoyed <lb/>
            internal peace, disturbed only by events which happened beyond the <lb/>
            peninsula, in which the Spartans alone had a direct interest. I allude <lb/>
            to the proceedings of the Sacred war; in which, as we have seen, <lb/>
            the only peninsular states that took an active part were the Spartans <lb/>
            and Acheeans, the latter partly influenced perhaps by their enmity <lb/>
            to the Locrians.</p>
          <p>Soon after the breaking out of the Sacred war the Spartans began <lb/>
            to conceive that it might turn to their private advantage. Fear of the <lb/>
            Thebans had in great measure restrained them from attempting to <lb/>
            recover their lost dominion. Yet to the hope that they should be <lb/>
            able to recover it at some future time they still most tenaciously <lb/>
            clung.2 Archidamus inherited all the courage and ambition of his <lb/>
            father, and burned with the desire both to reconquer Messenia, and <lb/>
            to break up the federal union, which made Arcadia independent of his <lb/>
            country. A great point was gained, if the Thebans, by being em­ <lb/>
            ployed elsewhere, could be kept away from Peloponnesus.3 Yet even <lb/>
            then Sparta would scarcely with her own force alone be able to ac­ <lb/>
            complish her designs. It was desirable to ra)ly round her as many as <lb/>
            possible of her former allies, and attach them to her cause by the bonds <lb/>
            of a common interest. To effect this, Archidamus conceived a scheme <lb/>
            (which would be more or less attractive to all of them) for a general <lb/>
            restitution of rights; by which Athens should recover Oropus, Elis <lb/>
            the Triphylian towns, PhliU8 Tricaranum, and she herself Messene: <lb/>
            and further that Orchomenus, Thespiæ, and Platæa, which the <lb/>
            Thebans had destroyed, should be reestablished, and the Arcadians <lb/>
            who wished it restored to their ancient abodes.4 The announce- <lb/>
            merit of this project was made in the year B c. 353, when the tide <lb/>
            of success had turned so strongly against the Thebans, that they <lb/>
            were unable to hold their ground in Bœotia, and it seemed almost <lb/>
            impossible that they could spare any troops for the assistance of their <lb/>
            friends in Peloponnesus. It soon became known, with what view <lb/>
            the Spartans were canvassing their allies; nor could the warlike pre­ <lb/>
            parations in Laconia remain a secret. That very year indeed they <lb/>
            commenced war against the Argives, whom they defeated, and took <note type="footnote"> (1) Diodorus, xv. 93. Pausanias, iii. 10. Plutarch, Vit. Agesil. 40. Xenophon, <lb/>

              the town of Ornem, probably with a view to cut off their communica­ <lb/>
              tion with Arcadia.1 The Megalopolitans, alarmed at the danger <lb/>
              which threatened them, and having at this time little hope of assist­ <lb/>
              ance from Thebes, sent an embassy to Athens, to solicit the protec­ <lb/>
              tion of the Athenian people. They were-supported by envoys from <lb/>
              Argos and Messene, and opposed by a counter-embassy from Lace­ <lb/>
              daemon. A warm debate took place in the Athenian assembly: for <lb/>
              an account of which, and especially of the view which Demosthenes <lb/>
              took of the question, I may refer to the Oration for the Megalopolitans, <lb/>
              and to the argument and notes in the first volume. The result was, <lb/>
              that Athens determined to be neutral: a policy unfortunate in its <lb/>
              results, as will hereafter appear.2</p>
          <p>The Megalopolitans, being disappointed of Athenian aid, could <lb/>
            only look to Thebes; but affairs took such a turn, that, when the <lb/>
            time came, Thebes was able to assist them. The Lacedæmonians in <lb/>
            their endeavour to negotiate an offensive alliance entirely failed, both <lb/>
            at Athens and in Peloponnesus. This delayed their operations. <lb/>
            They may have been promised assistance by Onomarchus, as soon as <lb/>
            he could dispose of his enemies in the north. The battle of Pagasæ <lb/>
            overthrew such hope, and rendered it necessary for them to send <lb/>
            succour into Phocis. But soon afterwards the exertions of Phayllus, <lb/>
            together with the support which he received ftom his allies, enabled <lb/>
            him to renew the war in Bceotia. The Lacedæmonians readily seized <lb/>
            this opportunity for commencing the long meditated attack upon <lb/>
            their neighbours.</p>
          <p>Archidamus opened the campaign by invading the Megalopolitan <lb/>
            territory, which he ravaged for some time without opposition. The <lb/>
            Megalopolitans sent for succour immediately to Argos, Sicyon, and <lb/>
            Messene, and also to Thebes. From the three first-mentioned cities <lb/>
            a large force was soon collected, and Thebes sent to their aid four <lb/>
            thousand infantry and five hundred horse under the command of <lb/>
            Cephision. Thus reinforced, they marched out and pitched their <lb/>
            camp near the sources of the river Alpheus. Archidamus, instead of <lb/>
            attacking them, led his troops off towards Mantinea, and took up a <lb/>
            position near that city, which he may have hoped was still friendly <lb/>
            to his cause. The allies advancing against him, he marched into <lb/>
            Argolis, surprised Orneæ, which appears to have been retaken since <lb/>
            his last expedition, and routed a body of Argives who were sent to <lb/>
            its relief. But now the united force of the allies came up with him, <lb/>
            and offered him battle. He had been reinforced by three thousand <lb/>
            Phocian mercenaries and a hundred and fifty of the horsemen whom <note type="footnote"> (1) Diodorus, xvi. 34. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) Pausanias, iv. 28, states that the Athenians promised to assist the Messenians, <lb/>
            if their country should be invaded, but declared they would not join them in any <lb/>
            invasion of Laconia. If so, they made a distinction between them and the Megalo­ <lb/>
            politans, whom we know they did not assist. Compare however Demosthenes, Pro <lb/>
            Megalop. 204; from which it would rather appear, that the engagement entered into <lb/>
            with the Messenians took place before this occasion. </note> <lb/>

            Lycophron had brought from Pherme : yet his numbers were but half <lb/>
            those of the enemy. An obstinate battle was fought, in which the <lb/>
            Spartans by their superior discipline made up for the disparity of <lb/>
            numbers: both sides however claimed the victory. The Argives and <lb/>
            other Peloponnesian allies having returned to their homes, as was <lb/>
            customary with citizen-troops in Greek warfare, Archidamus took <lb/>
            advantage of their absence to renew his ravages in Arcadia, and take <lb/>
            by storm the city of Helissus, with the spoils of which he returned <lb/>
            to Sparta. Not long afterwards the Thebans and their allies, falling <lb/>
            upon Anaxander, who commanded a Lacedæmonian division near <lb/>
            Telpbusa, defeated and made him prisoner. This battle was followed <lb/>
            by two others, in which the Spartans were vanquished with much <lb/>
            loss. In the next they gained a victory which fairly retrieved their <lb/>
            honour ; but immediately afterwards they retreated to their own <lb/>
            country. Archidamus, weary of a contest which promised him no <lb/>
            advantage, and in which he had suffered no less damage than his <lb/>
            adversaries, made overtures of peace, which the Megalopolitans <lb/>
            accepted; and the foreign auxiliaries on both sides retired from <lb/>
            Peloponnesus. The ill-advised project of Archidamus had no other <lb/>
            effect, than to exhibit the unabated animosity of the Spartans against <lb/>
            Megalopolis and Messene:1</p>
          <p>Not many years after these events the Peloponnesians were <lb/>
            apprised, that a more powerful enemy than Sparta was threatening <lb/>
            the independence of Greece. Before the battle of Pagasæ they <lb/>
            knew little of the king of Macedon besides his name. This brought <lb/>
            him prominently before them as an able general, commanding troops <lb/>
            formidable by their numbers and discipline. As yet however these <lb/>
            troops had not been tried against the heavy-armed infantry of the <lb/>
            leading states ; and Philip was still looked upon as a mere northern <lb/>
            potentate, protecting Thessaly, as his brother Alexander had done, <lb/>
            and extending the frontiers of his own native kingdom, but with no <lb/>
            thought of pushing his conquests south of Thermopylae. Even the <lb/>
            capture of Olynthus did not open the eyes of the Peloponnesians, <lb/>
            although Athens sent her envoys round to their cities, and Æschines <lb/>
            in his philippic at Megalopolis denounced the king of Macedon as a <lb/>
            savage barbarian, who was rising up to be the plague of the Grecian <lb/>
            world. They heard indeed that he had razed to the ground twenty <lb/>
            or thirty Chalcidian cities, and they saw with their own eyes the <lb/>
            Arcadian Atrestidas bringing to the slave-market a herd of Olynthian <lb/>
            women and children. Yet all this, though it may have excited pity <lb/>
            or indignation, did not convince them that Philip's progress was a <lb/>
            thing to excite alarm. The conqueror of Olynthus had become <lb/>
            a dangerous neighbour to the Athenian dominions in Thrace: they <lb/>
            themselves were too far removed from the scene to have much, <lb/>
            interest in it. So they reasoned. Nor did there want orators to <lb/>
            support these short-sighted views. One Hieronymus is said to have <note type="footnote"> (1) Diodorus, xvi. 39. Pausanias, viii. 27. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="358"/>
            opposed AEschines and spoken on Philip's behalf in the Megalopolitan <lb/>
            assembly. Æschines reported of the Arcadians, that they were glad <lb/>
            to hear that Athens was bestirring herself: but, whether this was true <lb/>
            or not, they showed no desire to assist her.1</p>
          <p>By the termination of the Sacred war Philip was raised to a <lb/>
            position both novel and imposing, in which the magnitude of his <lb/>
            power was apparent to all. He had stepped forward into the midst <lb/>
            of Greece as the elected general of the Amphictyons, the avenger of <lb/>
            outraged religion, the arbiter of peace and war. He was at once <lb/>
            king of Macedonia and Tagus of Thessaly: the mountain tribes of <lb/>
            Olympus and Pindus, Othrys and (Eta, were ready to flock to his <lb/>
            standard: the Thebans and Locrians were his grateful and devoted <lb/>
            allies. North of the Isthmus there were none to oppose him but the <lb/>
            Athenians; and they by themselves could offer but feeble resistance <lb/>
            to his power. Under these circumstances the Athenians turned their <lb/>
            eyes to Peloponnesus, as the quarter from which they might reason­ <lb/>
            ably hope to obtain support; it being now obvious that, if Athens <lb/>
            should succumb to Philip, the Peloponnesians would have no barrier <lb/>
            against him. Little was to be expected from the Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            disgusted with Athens for her weak and seemingly treacherous con­ <lb/>
            duct in abandoning the Phocians. The best chance was with the <lb/>
            other peninsular states, and to them the Athenians determined to <lb/>
            apply, to form a league for mutual protection against Philip.</p>
          <p>If the Athenians however imagined that Philip intended to leave <lb/>
            the game of diplomacy in their hands, they were completely mistaken. <lb/>
            Philip was no less active in negotiation than in war. Where he <lb/>
            designed to extend his influence and power, his emissaries went like <lb/>
            skirmishers before him, winning and seducing both statesmen and <lb/>
            people to his side by every species of corruption and intrigue. It <lb/>
            was soon found that lie had been beforehand with the Athenians in <lb/>
            Peloponnesus; and circumstances had happened which greatly <lb/>
            favoured his designs.</p>
          <p>In a short time after the end of the Phocian war some territorial <lb/>
            disputes arose between the Lacedæmonians and their neighbours. <lb/>
            Pausanias says, that from early times it was the custom of the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians, when they had nothing to occupy them out of <lb/>
            Peloponnesus, to raise a border quarrel with the Argives.2 It was <lb/>
            not likely that the Messenians would fare much better with them. <lb/>
            Philip having now his established agents in these countries, they <lb/>
            persuaded the people to solicit his support. There were plausible <lb/>
            arguments for it. The Thebans, their former protectors, had been <lb/>
            befriended by Philip; while the Athenians had rather displayed a <lb/>
            sympathy with Sparta.3Philip eagerly availed himself of this <lb/>
            favourable opportunity for putting himself at the head of the old <note type="footnote"> '1) See ante, pp. 284, 285. The apathy of the Greeks is forcibly described by <lb/>

            Theban confederacy.1 He sent a body of mercenaries and a supply <lb/>
            of money to the Messenians and Argives, and promised to come in <lb/>
            person, if necessary, to their assistance. At the same time he sent <lb/>
            a peremptory message to the Spartans, requiring them (among other <lb/>
            things) to abandon their pretensions to Messenia, and threatening <lb/>
            them with war, in case of refusal. To this he received a laconic <lb/>
            answer of defiance: yet his measures seem to have had the desired <lb/>
            effect of securing his allies against Spartan aggression, and establish­ <lb/>
            ing his own popularity not only at Argos and Messene, but also <lb/>
            among their confederates in Arcadia. We read that shortly after­ <lb/>
            wards both the Arcadians and Argives erected statues to Philip, <lb/>
            conferred crowns of honour upon him, and passed resolutions to receive <lb/>
            him in their cities, if he came to Peloponnesus. Pausanias. declares, <lb/>
            that the hatred of the Arcadians to Sparta was one of theprincipal <lb/>
            causes to which Philip and his kingdom owed their aggrandisement.2</p>
          <p>These proceedings quickly excited attention at Athens. Demo­ <lb/>
            sthenes carried a decree for sending an embassy to Peloponnesus, and <lb/>
            was himself put at its head.3 He went to Argos and Messene, and <lb/>
            in both of those cities made instructive speeches, setting forth the <lb/>
            danger of their connexion with Philip. He has given us in the <lb/>
            second Philippic an extract from his speech to the Messenians, in <lb/>
            which he bade them take warning by the example of Olynthus, which <lb/>
            Philip first befriended and then destroyed, and also by that of <lb/>
            Thessaly, which he had reduced to vassalage : he conjured them not <lb/>
            to be deceived by the gifts or promises of Philip, not to trust a man <lb/>
            of such notorious bad faith, and not to ally themselves with a despot, <lb/>
            the natural enemy of republics.4 This harangue was received, as he <lb/>
            tells us, with great applause; yet its effect was transient. The <lb/>
            Peloponnesian allies of Philip could not be induced to break with <lb/>
            him by any Athenian arguments. They had an advantage in Mace­ <lb/>
            donian protection, which they doubted whether Athens was willing <lb/>
            or able to afford.' The prospect of danger held out to them by <lb/>
            Demosthenes was (in their view) remote: but there might be an im­ <lb/>
            mediate danger in offending Philip: as he was now a powerful friend, <lb/>
            so he might be a powerful enemy. Things had already come about <lb/>
            as Demosthenes feared they would. At first people could not <lb/>
            imagine that Philip's power would ever be felt in southern Greece : <lb/>
            all of a sudden he appears before them as a giant whom none can <note type="footnote"> (1) Demosthenes, Orat. ad Epist. 153; from which it appears, that the Thebans <lb/>

            withstand: then the minor states are either desirous of his protect <lb/>
            tion, or afraid to provoke his hostility. Such was his present in­ <lb/>
            fluence over the Argives and Messenians, that he induced them to <lb/>

            joint remonstrance was prepared, identifying the cause of Philip with <lb/>
            that of his allies. The Athenians, it was alleged, had violated the <lb/>
            treaty of peace by sending agents to stir up the Greeks against <lb/>
            Philip; and at the same time they were encouraging the Spartans in <lb/>
            their aggressive projects. Python of Byzantium was Philip's principal <lb/>
            envoy, and it may perhaps have been on this occasion that he poured <lb/>
            out that torrent of invective against Athens, which Demosthenes <lb/>
            says he triumphantly answered, so as to vindicate his country from <lb/>
            the calumnies of Philip. A reply was sent to the remonstrance, <lb/>
            which left the dispute between Philip and the Athenians unsettled.1</p>
          <p>Elis was next the theatre of intrigue. This city, formerly the <lb/>
            best governed of any in Greece, was thrown into strife and disorder <lb/>
            by the corrupting arts of Philip. A Macedonian party got the upper <lb/>
            hand, not without violence and bloodshed, and drove a large body of <lb/>
            their opponents into exile. Elis was then transferred from the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonian alliance to that of which Philip was at the head. <lb/>
            The exiles afterwards, hiring the remnant of that mercenary band <lb/>
            which had followed Phalæcus into Crete, invaded the country and <lb/>
            were defeated, as I have already mentioned, by the Elean and <lb/>
            Arcadian troops.1 Demosthenes in the third Philippic speaks of <lb/>
            Elis as being virtually in the power of Philip.3</p>
          <p>It was Philip's design to surround with enemies both Sparta and <lb/>
            Athens, so that, being cut off from support, they must ultimately <lb/>
            yield to his demands. Sparta was already isolated; and so would <lb/>
            Athens be, if Eubœa, Megara, Corinth, and Achaia were either sub­ <lb/>
            dued or gained over to his alliance. To make these acquisitions, <lb/>
            Philip laid his plans in the year B. c. 343. The enterprises against <lb/>
            Euboea and Megara were left to his generals: that against Pelopon­ <lb/>
            nesus he resolved to conduct in person. It would have excited <note type="footnote"> (1) Argument, ad Philipp. ii.: De Coron. 272. The occasion upon which this <lb/>
            contest of eloquence took place between Python and Demosthenes is matter of con­ <lb/>
            troversy. Some assign it to a later period, when Python came to adjust disputes <lb/>
            about the peace. Diodorus (xvi. 85) refers it to the debate at Thebes. In the pas­ <lb/>
            sage cited from the Oration on the Crown, it is mentioned that AEschines spoke on <lb/>
            Python's side; which indicates the debate to have taken place at Athens. It is <lb/>
            mentioned also, that Philip's allies were present, and that, after hearing Demo­ <lb/>
            sthenes, they got up and admitted Philip to be in the wrong; which rather points to <lb/>
            this occasion, when the Messenians and Argives accompanied the Macedonian am­ <lb/>
            bassadors. The second Philippic, it seems clear enough, was spoken in support of a <lb/>
            motion for a reply to this embassy. (See Philipp. ii. 72. Dionysius, ad Ammæum, <lb/>
            s. 10, p. 737.) It cannot however have been the oration in which Demosthenes so <lb/>
            triumphantly answered Python; for it contains no answer to him at all. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) Ante, p. 309. </note><note type="footnote"> (3) Demosthenes, Philipp. iii. 118; iv. 133: De Fall Leg. 424, 435. Pausaniss, <lb/>

            alarm, if he had marched by the ordinary route to the Isthmus, <lb/>
            especially as he had no ostensible cause of war: he therefore pur­ <lb/>
            posed to take a westerly course through Epirus and Acarnania to the <lb/>
            Corinthian gulf. The kingdom of Epirus seems at this time to have <lb/>
            been divided between his uncle Arymbas and his brother-in-law <lb/>
            Alexander.1 Philip led his army to the Cassopian coast, and took <lb/>
            by storm three cities, Elates, Pandosia, and Bucheta, Elean colonies, <lb/>
            which he annexed to the dominions of Alexander. He then advanced <lb/>
            to the Ambracian gulf, meditating an attack upon the Corinthian <lb/>
            colonies of Ambracia and Leucas; and it seems that he was nego­ <lb/>
            tiating an alliance with the Ætolians, to whom he promised to give <lb/>
            Naupactus, as soon as he had taken it from the Achæans.2 He <lb/>
            would then have passed through Acarnania to join the Ætolians, <lb/>
            and, after taking the Achæan fortresses on the northern coast of the <lb/>
            Corinthian gulf, might have transported his forces over to Achaia. <lb/>
            It is not unlikely that the Achæans and Corinthians got information <lb/>
            of these projects, and communicated them to Athens. The Athenians <lb/>
            by unwonted exertions contrived to baffle Philip at this point, <lb/>
            and arrest his further progress. An embassy, at the head of which <lb/>
            were Demosthenes, Polyeuctus, Hegesippus, Clitomachus,. and <lb/>
            Lycurgus, was sent to Acarnania and Peloponnesus, where they <lb/>
            succeeded in forming a league and organizing active measures for <lb/>
            defence. Athenian troops were promptly sent into Acarnania. <lb/>
            Megara also promised assistance, having been secured against Mace­ <lb/>
            donian attack by the measures of Phocion, as already mentioned. <lb/>
            Philip, either not being prepared, or not wishing to attack the <lb/>
            Athenians at present, or failing in his negotiations with the Ætolians:, <lb/>
            desisted from his attempt and retired to Macedonia.3</p>
          <p>No further movement occurred in Peloponnesus, until the campaign <lb/>
            of Chæronea. Philip then invited his Peloponnesian allies to join <lb/>
            him; but none of them came. The Achæans and Corinthians fought <lb/>
            for Athens.4After the battle, having completed the subjugation of <lb/>
            northern Greece, Philip led his army into the peninsula, to consolidate <lb/>
            his power among the states, and enforce the submission of those <lb/>
            which held out against him or wavered. He then designed to unite <note type="footnote"> (1) See Thirlwall, History of Greece, vi. 16, note 3. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) The possession by the Achæans of Naupactus, Dyme, and Calydon, was an <lb/>

            had encountered Philip's agents in Ambracia. He justly boasts of his own zealous <lb/>
            activity in executing, as well as designing and advising, these important missions <lb/>
            (ibid. 301). Æschines (Contr. Ctesiph. 67) charges Demosthenes with giving a false <lb/>
            account of his success on these expeditions. The charge is a mere calumny. That <lb/>
            troops were sent into Acarnania, appears from the incidental mention of them in <lb/>
            Demosthenes, Contr. Olympiodorum, 1173. And the harsh measures afterwards <lb/>
            taken by Philip against the Ambraciots and Acarnanians, are evidence of their suc­ <lb/>

            them all in a common league against Persia. None were inclined to <lb/>
            dispute his will but the Lacedæmonians ; and them he resolved to <lb/>
            humble, both for the satisfaction of his allies, and as a measure of <lb/>
            precaution against future disturbance. At the head of an overpower­ <lb/>
            ing force he entered Laconia, ravaging it on all sides, and pillaging <lb/>
            or destroying some of the rural townships. The Spartans behaved <lb/>
            worthily of their ancient reputation. Though not strong enough to <lb/>
            encounter the enemy's whole force in open field, they still refused to <lb/>
            capitulate. We read of one victory which they gained over a de­ <lb/>
            tached body of Macedonians at Gythium. Philip forbore to attack <lb/>
            the capital. He sought to cripple the power of Sparta, not to crush <lb/>
            her entirely; perhaps, as the Acarnanian envoy says in Polybius, he <lb/>
            checked the more violent counsels of his Peloponnesian followers.1 <lb/>
            The end of it was, that he stripped Sparta of territory on every side, <lb/>
            giving one portion of it to the Argives. another to the Tegeans, a <lb/>
            third to the Megalopolitans, and a fourth to the Messenians. His <lb/>
            acts were ratified afterwards by the Greek congress, though they <lb/>
            were never acknowledged by the Lacedæmomans.2</p>
          <p>On his return from Laconia, he visited some of the friendly <lb/>
            states; making stay among the Arcadians, whom he wished to attach <lb/>
            firmly to himself and draw entirely away from the cause of the <lb/>
            Greeks. How well he succeeded, was fully proved by subsequent <lb/>
            events : at this time it appeared in homage and flattery. At a village <lb/>
            near Mantinea, where he pitched his camp, a spring received the <lb/>
            name of Philip's spring. The Megalopolitans gave his name to a <lb/>
            portico in their market-place. Similar compliments were paid him <lb/>
            by the Eleans. He erected on the sacred ground at Olympic a <lb/>
            circular building surrounded with a colonnade, which was named <lb/>
            after him Philippeum.3 The gracious and winning manners of the <lb/>
            king helped doubtless to increase his popularity.4</p>
          <p>He next proceeded to the Isthmus of Corinth, where he had in­ <lb/>
            vited a congress of all the Greeks to assemble. It was attended by <lb/>
            deputies from all the chief cities, except Sparta. The dream of <lb/>
            Isocrates was now about to be realised, though not exactly in the <lb/>
            manner which that philosopher would have desired. Philip proposed <lb/>
            to make war against the Persians, and take vengeance upon them for <lb/>
            their profanation of the Greek temples in days of old. The deputies <lb/>
            passed an unanimous vote in accordance with his desire. War was <lb/>
            declared, Each state was ordered to furnish a contingent of ships <lb/>
            or land force: and Philip was elected general of the national army. <note type="footnote"> (1) The Eleans, though they declined to aid him at Chæronea, are said to have <lb/>

          <p>DIODORUS thus commences his narrative of the year 338 B.C. <lb/>
            “Philip, having won over the greater number of the Greeks to his <lb/>
            alliance, was anxious to strike terror into the Athenians and hold <lb/>
            without a rival the leadership of Greece. He therefore suddenly <lb/>
            took possession of Elatea, and there gathering his forces resolved to <lb/>
            attack the Athenians. As they were unprepared, by reason of the <lb/>
            treaty of peace, he expected that he should easily conquer them: <lb/>
            and such was the event."</p>
          <p>Justin, after relating Philip's expedition into Scythia, his victory <lb/>
            over Atheas the Scythian prince, and the bloody battle fought on his <lb/>
            return with the Triballi, in which he was severely wounded, (the date <lb/>
            of which event seems to be in the spring or early summer of 339 B.C.) <lb/>
            continues thus:2—</p>
          <p>" Ubi vero ex vulnere primum convaluit, diu dissimulatum bellum <lb/>
            Atheniensibus infert."</p>
          <p>The treaty of peace referred to in the passage of Diodorus is that <lb/>
            which he relates to have been concluded in the year B.C. 340, when <lb/>
            Philip raised the siege of Byzantium.3 This, as I have before men­ <lb/>
            tioned,4 has given rise to controversy among modern historians. The <lb/>
            testimony of Diodorus, confirmed apparently by certain records cited <lb/>
            in the oration on the Crown, has induced some writers to accept the <lb/>
            peace as an historical fact. Others, who deem it irreconcilable with <lb/>
            the language of Demosthenes, which represents the war of 340 B. c. <lb/>
            as continuing long after the date of the supposed peace,5 and who <lb/>
            also consider the records in the oration on the Crown to be spurious, <note type="footnote"> damonii et legem et regem contempserunt, servitutem, non pacem rati, quæ non <lb/>

              and the authority of Diodorus not sufficient of itself to prove <lb/>
              doubtful point-and swayed also by some other arguments-reject <lb/>
              the peace altogether.1 Grote takes a middle view of the question, <lb/>
              supposing that Philip concluded peace with the Byzantines, Perin­ <lb/>
              thians, and some other of the Greeks who had assisted them, but not <lb/>
              with the Athenians and their more intimate allies.2 This may seem <lb/>
              to reconcile Diodorus with Demosthenes: yet it is hardly probable in <lb/>
              itself, that the allies would consent to make such a distinction. <lb/>
              Perhaps the simplest account of the matter is, that a mere armistice <lb/>
              was concluded between the parties, leaving a more formal treaty or <lb/>
              peace to be afterwards decided on; and that a naval war, chiefly of <lb/>
              a privateering character, was irregularly carried on between Athens <lb/>
              and Macedonia in spite of the armistice.3</p>
          <p>The words of Justin (diu dissimulatum helium Atheniensibus infert) <lb/>
            throw no light on this question of the peace. They have reference <lb/>
            to the long forbearance of Philip to attack the Athenians in their <lb/>
            own country, which at length he determined to do.</p>
          <p>It is further to be remarked, that neither Diodorus nor Justin, <lb/>
            makes the slightest mention of those extraordinary proceedings at <lb/>
            Delphi in the year B.C. 339, which kindled a new Sacred war, and <lb/>
            were, according to both of the Athenian orators, Demosthenes and <lb/>
            Æschines, the immediate cause of Philip's march into Phocis and all <lb/>
            the calamities that followed.</p>
          <p>Demosthenes informs us (I give the sum of what he says) :4—</p>
          <p>That Philip was suffering greatly by the maritime blockade which the <lb/>
            Athenians kept up around his coast, and by the depredations of their <lb/>
            privateers: it therefore became desirable to carry the war into <lb/>
            Attica; which could not well be done, unless the Thessalians were <lb/>
            on his side, and the Thebans gave him a passage through their <lb/>
            country. Neither of these people would have liked to assist him in <lb/>
            a private quarrel; but if a new Sacred war could be stirred up, he <lb/>
            might be chosen to conduct it as before, and so gather round his <lb/>
            standard many of the Amphictyonic tribes. To accomplish this, he en­ <lb/>
            gaged the services of Æschines; who, as the first step in the business <lb/>
            got himself appointed Amphictyonic deputy, no one at Athens in <lb/>
            the least suspecting what his design was; then proceeding to the <lb/>
            spring meeting at Delphi, and taking his place in the assembly, pit­ <lb/>
            ferred a charge of impiety against the Locrians of Amphissa, for <lb/>
            cultivating a portion of the Cirrhæan ground. He made such an <note type="footnote"> (1) See Thirlwall, History of Greece, vi. 59. The objections are there very dearly <lb/>
            stated. Is it possible that Diodorus confounds this with the peace of 346 B. c.fIt <lb/>
            is remarkable that he gives no account of the latter. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) Grote, History of Greece, xi. 638. </note><note type="footnote"> . (3) Chiefly perhaps to the advantage of the Athenians, as Demosthenes asserts; <lb/>
            yet that Philip resorted to privateering, in order to recruit his finances, is related by <lb/>
            Justin, it. 1: “ Igitur Philippus, longâ obsidionis morâ exhaustus, pecuniæ com­ <lb/>
            mercium de piraticâ mutuatur. Captis itaque centum septuaginta navibus merci­ <lb/>
            busque distractis, anhelantem inopiam paululum recreavit." </note><note type="footnote"> (4) Demosthenes, De Coron. 275-278. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="365"/>
            nflammatory speech, appealing to the religious feelings of the depu­ <lb/>
            ties, that they were persuaded to go in person and take a view of the <lb/>
            acred ground. The Locrians speedily came and drove them off, not <lb/>
            abstaining from acts of violence. The council, resenting such an <lb/>
            insult offered to its members, declared war against the Locrians, <lb/>
            choosing Cottyphus for their general; but as it was found impossible <lb/>
            by the voluntary exertions of the Amphictyonic states to get an <lb/>
            army strong enough to enforce their authority, it was contrived by <lb/>
            Philip's agents and partisans at the ensuing Pylæan congress, that <lb/>
            he should be elected general. Philip then, collecting an army, and <lb/>
            marching to Thermopylae with the professed intention of chastising <lb/>
            the Amphissians, suddenly took possession of Elatea.</p>
          <p>If the statement of Demosthenes rested on his sole credit, one <lb/>
            might be inclined to suspect that he had greatly magnified the im­ <lb/>
            portance of these transactions, or misrepresented the real truth. <lb/>
            When however we find his statement confirmed in all its main features <lb/>
            by Æschines, we can do no otherwise than accept it as historical evi­ <lb/>
            dence ; and it proves to us, how little such writers as Diodorus and <lb/>
            Justin are to be depended on for a correct outline of the events <lb/>
            which they profess to related</p>
          <p>AEschines describes the scene at Delphi and the subsequent pro­ <lb/>
            ceedings, in which he himself took an active part, with much greater <lb/>
            prolixity of detail than Demosthenes. He gives a somewhat different <lb/>
            colour to the affair; yet, so far from denying that his own charge <lb/>
            against the Locrians brought on a new Sacred war, he boasts of it; <lb/>
            and contends that Athens might and ought to have put herself at the <lb/>
            head of the movement, and that it was owing to the treacherous <lb/>
            counsel of Demosthenes, that Philip was chosen to be Amphictyonic <lb/>
            general. The bold manner in which Æschines launches into the <lb/>
            history of this affair, denouncing his rival as the prime author of the <lb/>
            whole mischief, gives the idea, as it was intended to do, that he him­ <lb/>
            self brought the matter forward as an accuser only, and not because <lb/>
            be felt the necessity of defending his own conduct. There is how­ <lb/>
            ever no doubt, that his object was more to exculpate himself than to <lb/>
            attack Demosthenes; and this, with all his craft, he cannot help <lb/>
            betraying. We have to bear in mind, that AEschines was not for the <lb/>
            first time in the oration on the Crown charged by his opponent with <lb/>
            having kindled the last Sacred war. That charge had been urged <lb/>
            against him frequently before, both in public and in private; and <lb/>
            Æschines knew perfectly well what Demosthenes would have to say <lb/>
            upon the subject in his reply.2 For this very reason he prefers a <note type="footnote"> (1) Plutarch, writing biography, not history, does not profess always to follow the <lb/>
            course of events. He makes a passing allusion only to the Amphissian war. (Vit. <lb/>
            Demosth. 18.) </note><note type="footnote"> (2) That Æschines was all along anticipating an attack upon himself, that he well <lb/>
            understood the course of argument which Demosthenes would pursue, and that he <lb/>
            greatly feared the prejudice of the people in his opponent's favour, will appear from <lb/>
            a careful perusal of the oration against Ctesiphon: see pp. 61, 62, where occurs </note> <lb/>

            counter-accusation, by which he hoped to beget a prejudice in his <lb/>
            own favour; but which, as we shall see presently, is based upon little <lb/>
            but the assertion of the accuser.</p>
          <p>The account which AEschines gives of the whole proceeding is to <lb/>
            the following effect:1—</p>
          <p>That the Locrians of Amphissa were cultivating and turning to <lb/>
            profane purposes the holy ground of Cirrha, not withstanding the <lb/>
            solemn oath sworn in the first Sacred war, which forbade it ever <lb/>
            again to be appropriated to the use of man; that they had repaired <lb/>
            the harbour of that ancient town, and built houses round it, and were <lb/>
            taking tolls or duties of the visitors who landed there; that they had <lb/>
            bribed some of the Amphictyonic deputies, among others Demo­ <lb/>
            sthenes, to say nothing about it; that Demosthenes had been paid <lb/>
            a thousand drachms in the first instance, when he was sent as deputy <lb/>
            from Athens, and they had engaged for the future to pay him twenty <lb/>
            minas a-year, if he would constantly support them at Athens.</p>
          <p>That in the year 339 B.c. Midias, Thrasycles, and himself were <lb/>
            elected to serve the office of Pylagoræ, and sent to Delphi, together <lb/>
            with Diognetus the Hieromnemon. That soon after their arrival <lb/>
            Diognetus and Midias were seized with a fever; the Amphictyons <lb/>
            had already assembled, when a message was brought to Æschines, in­ <lb/>
            forming him that the Amphissians, to please their friends the The­ <lb/>
            were about to move a resolution against the people of Athens; which <lb/>
            was, to fine them fifty talents for having hung up in a new chapel, <lb/>
            before it was finished, some golden shields with the following inscrip­ <lb/>
            tion : 2 " By the Athenians, out of spoil taken from the Persians and <lb/>
            Thebans when they fought against the Greeks." That Diognetus sent <lb/>
            for him, and begged that he would go to the council, and defend <lb/>
            his country before the Amphictyons. He did so; but scarcely had <lb/>
            he begun to speak, when one of the Amphissians rudely interrupted <lb/>
            him, crying out, " Men of Greece, if you were wise, you would not <lb/>
            allow the name of the Athenians to be mentioned on these days, but <lb/>
            would drive them from the temple as a people under a curse." At the <note type="footnote"> the artful illustration which Demosthenes exposes, De Coron. 303: p. 71, where he <lb/>

              to the time or mode of presenting the shields. the other to the inscription. It weal? <lb/>
              seem, that a new fane or chapel was in the course of erection at Delphi, and the <lb/>
              Athenians had exhibited their offerings before it was completely finished, or before <lb/>
              some ceremony of consecration had been performed. The inscription was necessarily <lb/>
              offensive to the Thebans; and, although the Athenians had probably presented these <lb/>
              shields in lieu of others similarly inscribed, which the Phocian generals had destroyed. <lb/>
              it gave a handle for censure, that they should at this time have taken a step which <lb/>
              would hurt the feelings of their neighbours. See Thirlwall, History of Greece, vi- <lb/>

              same time he brought up the Phocian alliance and other matters of <lb/>
              accusation against Athens; all which so enraged Æschines, that in <lb/>
              'Lhe heat of the moment he retorted the charge of impiety against <lb/>
              the Locrians, and reproached them with the use which they had made <lb/>
              of the consecrated plain. The plain itself and the port of Cirrha <lb/>
              were visible from the spot where they were assembled. AEschines <lb/>
              pointed them out to the deputies. " Amphictyons! " he cried: " you <lb/>
              behold yonder plain cultivated by the Amphissians, with the pottery <lb/>
              works and farm-houses which they have built upon it. You see with <lb/>
              your own eyes the fortifications of the devoted harbour. You know <lb/>
              yourselves, and need no witnesses to tell you, that these men have <lb/>
              taken tolls and are making profits from the sacred harbour." He <lb/>
              then bade them read the oracle, the oath of their ancestors, and the <lb/>
              solemn imprecation, (all which were before their eyes, inscribed on <lb/>
              a tablet;) and having first declared his determination, on behalf of <lb/>
              the people of Athens, himself, his children, and his family, to stand <lb/>
              by the god and the sacred land, as that ancient oath required, he <lb/>
              solemnly adjured the Amphictyons to do the same, and to free them­ <lb/>
              selves from the curse that must otherwise hang over them as the <lb/>
              abettors or tolerators of sacrilege.</p>
          <p>The speech of Æschines—so he goes on to state-caused a great <lb/>
            tumult and uproar in the council. All question of the shields was <lb/>
            forgotten, and nothing thought of but the punishment of the Locrians. <lb/>
            As the day was far advanced, a proclamation was made by the herald, <lb/>
            commanding that all the Delphians of military age, both freemen <lb/>
            and slaves, should assemble the next morning with spades and pick­ <lb/>
            axes at the place of sacrifice, and that the Hieromnemons and other <lb/>
            deputies should be at the same place to assist in the cause of Apollo <lb/>
            and the sacred land: and further announcing that, whatever people <lb/>
            failed to attend, would be excluded from the temple and regarded as <lb/>
            execrable and accursed.</p>
          <p>At the time appointed, he says, the full multitude came together <lb/>
            and went down to Cirrha, where they quickly demolished the harbour <lb/>
            and set fire to the houses which had been erected: but a large body <lb/>
            of Amphissians coming with arms to attack them, they took to their <lb/>
            heels, and with difficulty escaped to Delphi. The next day Cottyphus, <lb/>
            a Pharsalian citizen, who officiated as president of the congress, <lb/>
            called a general assembly of Amphictyons, composed not only of the <lb/>
            representative synod, but of all who came to take a part in the sacri­ <lb/>
            fice or consult the oracle. Here, after much abuse of the Locrians <lb/>
            and praise of Athens, a resolution was passed, that the deputies <lb/>
            should assemble at Thermopylae on a certain day before the next ordi­ <lb/>
            nary meeting, to pass sentence on the Locrians for their acts of <lb/>
            sacrilege and insult to the Amphictyons.</p>
          <p>When this resolution was first communicated to the Athenians, <lb/>
            Machines declares, they fully acquiesced in its propriety, and ex­ <lb/>
            pressed their readiness to comply with it. Demosthenes raised some <lb/>
             <pb n="368"/>
            opposition, in pursuance of his engagement with the Locrians; but <lb/>
            he (Æschines) completely set him down.1 Upon which Demosthenes <lb/>
            had recourse to a manoeuvre: he got a decree first secretly passed <lb/>
            by the council, and then carried in the assembly after the regular <lb/>
            business was all over, and when hardly any citizens were present; <lb/>
            which decree was to the effect:-" that the deputies of Athens <lb/>
            should go regularly to Thermopylae and to Delphi at the times <lb/>
            appointed by their ancestors; and that they should take no part <lb/>
            whatever in the extraordinary meeting about to be held at <lb/>
            Thermopylæ." The consequence was, that Athens took no part in <lb/>
            the ensuing measures of the Amphictyons. The special meeting was <lb/>
            attended by representatives from all the other states except Thebes. <lb/>
            War was declared against the Amphissian Locrians, and Cottyphus <lb/>
            was elected general. The Amphictyonic army marched into Locris, <lb/>
            but behaved with the utmost moderation, imposing a fine only on the <lb/>
            people to be paid on a given day, banishing the principal advisers of <lb/>
            the sacrilege, and restoring the opponents who had been driven into <lb/>
            exile. As the fine however was not paid, and the Amphissians <lb/>
            reversed the acts of Cottyphus after his troops had been withdrawn, <lb/>
            the second expedition against them took place after a long interval, <lb/>
            when Philip had returned from Scythia. "And so," says Æschines, <lb/>
            " when the gods had given the lead in this pious enterprise to <lb/>
            Athens, she was deprived of it by the corrupt act of Demosthenes."</p>
          <p>Here AEschines breaks off, just at the time when we should have <lb/>
            been glad to hear the rest of his narrative. Instead of giving any <lb/>
            explanation about Philip's appointment and the circumstances at­ <lb/>
            tending it, he quits these matters of fact, and runs into a rhapsody <lb/>
            of declamation, by which, as he had played upon the weak under­ <lb/>
            standings of the Amphictyonic council, he might hope to excite the <lb/>
            feelings of the Athenian people: but he had not the same success.2</p>
          <p>The accounts of Demosthenes and Æschines, agreeing in their <lb/>
            main outlines, and especially in the important result of Philip's <lb/>
            election to conduct the new Sacred war, differ in the following par­ <lb/>
            ticulars: 1. As to the Locrians having preferred a charge of im­ <lb/>
            piety against the Athenians: 2. As to the motives which each of the <lb/>
            two orators imputes to his rival: 3. As to some of the details of the <lb/>
            first Amphictyonic campaign.</p>
          <p>That the Locrian people should have brought a formal accusation <lb/>
            against the Athenians, such as that mentioned by Æschines, is im­ <lb/>
            probable, not merely for the reason assigned by Demosthenes, that <lb/>
            no record is produced of a citation to answer the charge; but also <note type="footnote"> (1) This quite agrees with what Demosthenes says (De Coron. 275): <foreign xml:lang="grc">καἰ τότ'εὐθὐς</foreign> </note> <figure type="illustration">

              because the alleged offence is not one which the Locrian people were <lb/>
              likely to have cared about; and further, if (as AEschines says) they <lb/>
              were conscious of being themselves trespassers upon the sacred land, <lb/>
              this would naturally have deterred them from raising such questions <lb/>
              against others. If it be said, that they were instigated by the <lb/>
              Thebans, we may answer first, that there is no evidence of this; <lb/>
              secondly, it is disproved by the conduct of the Thebans themselves, <lb/>
              who showed pretty clearly by their keeping aloof from the special <lb/>
              meeting at Thermopylæ, that they had had quite enough of Sacred <lb/>
              wars and Amphictyonic quarrels. It is very possible however, that <lb/>
              some individual Amphissian. either at Philip's instigation or from <lb/>
              other motives, got up in the council to complain of what the Athenians <lb/>
              had done; and this led to an angry debate, in which Æschines re­ <lb/>
              torted the charge of impiety upon the countrymen of his oppynent.</p>
          <p>At what time the Amphissians began to take possession of the <lb/>
            port and plain of Cirrha, AEschines does not inform us: and modern <lb/>
            historians do not agree upon the subject. Grote says,1 it appears <lb/>
            both from Demosthenes and Æschines, that it was an ancient and <lb/>
            established occupation. The passages which he cites however do <lb/>
            not bear him out;2 on the contrary, the whole narrative of Æschines <lb/>
            tends to prove, that it was a recent intrusion of which the Amphissians <lb/>
            were accused. Had it been otherwise, it would not have been easy <lb/>
            to excite a tumult against them at Delphi: nor would there have been <lb/>
            any colour for the charge which AEschines brings against Demosthenes, <lb/>
            of having received bribes from the Amphissian people. Though we <lb/>
            may have no hesitation in rejecting the truth of that charge, it is <lb/>
            difficult to suppose that it could have been advanced, unless the <lb/>
            Amphissians had some assignable motive for offering a bribe. If <lb/>
            what they were doing at Cirrha had been acquiesced in for so long a <lb/>
            period, they could have had little to fear, and had no occasion to <lb/>
            purchase the silence of the Amphictyonic deputies. If this usurpa­ <lb/>
            tion had been recent, one can understand their motives in so doing. <lb/>
            But further, it is distinctly asserted by AEschines, that theAmphictyons, <lb/>
            when they invaded Locris, banished the principal authors of the sacri­ <lb/>
            lege, and restored those who had been driven into exile for their piety, <lb/>
            that is, for their opposition to the sacrilege: a statement which implies, <lb/>
            as I conceive, that the alleged sacrilege had been recently committed <lb/>
            and was the subject of contest among the Locrians themselves.3</p>
          <p>That after the first Sacred war it became necessary to renovate <lb/>
            in some degree the port and town of Cirrha, for the accommodation <note type="footnote"> (I) History of Greece, xi. 648. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) Demosthenes, De ColOn. 277.

              of visitors coming by sea to Delphi, we may with Grote very fairly <lb/>
              assume: but I see no reason for supposing that the Amphissiaa <lb/>
              Locrians took this duty upon them. It is more likely that the <lb/>
              Delphians provided the convenience of a harbour for their guests, <lb/>
              regarding it both as a duty and a privilege of their own. When the <lb/>
              second Sacred war broke out, Cirrha fell into the hands of the <lb/>
              Phocians; and we have no historical account of what they did with it. <lb/>
              When however the Amphissian Locrians submitted to Onomarchus, <lb/>
              it is very possible that he permitted them to occupy that ancient <lb/>
              seaport under an arrangement beneficial to both parties. The <lb/>
              Locrians may then have enlarged and improved the harbour, built <lb/>
              new houses in the town, and ploughed up and farmed a considerable <lb/>
              portion of the surrounding plain. We hear of no more war between <lb/>
              them and the Phocians after the peace made with Onomarchus; nor <lb/>
              could he have taken a better way to disarm their hostility than by <lb/>
              making to them such a concession. At the end of that war the <lb/>
              Locrians must have felt that their title to this newly acquired district <lb/>
              was questionable and precarious. Although the Delphians in the <lb/>
              first rejoicing after victory might not wish to disturb them in their <lb/>
              possession, yet in the course of a short time they may have begun to <lb/>
              think more seriously of it, especially if the improvements of the <lb/>
              town and neighbourhood of Cirrha were of such magnitude as to <lb/>
              excite attention. As soon as the title of the Locrians became the <lb/>
              subject of discussion, they would naturally be alarmed, and might <lb/>
              endeavour by intrigue or otherwise to make interest for themselves <lb/>
              with the Amphictyonic deputies. This may have afforded a colour <lb/>
              for the charge of AEschines against Demosthenes.</p>
          <p>That there was anything more however than a colourable pre­ <lb/>
            tence for such charge against Demosthenes, I altogether disbelieve. <lb/>
            The only ground alleged by Æschines is, that he dissuaded his coun­ <lb/>
            trymen from taking any part in the hostile movement against the <lb/>
            Locrians. But in this he only exhibited the zeal and foresight of <lb/>
            a good statesman. His prediction was but too true, that Æschines <lb/>
            was bringing an Amphictyonic war into Attica. The Athenians, <lb/>
            though at first they disregarded the warning, considering it to have <lb/>
            been dictated by private enmity, shortly afterwards came over to his <lb/>
            views, and passed a resolution virtually condemning the acts of the <lb/>
            Amphictyons. Æschines, to persuade his hearers that this resolution <lb/>
            was not the genuine opinion of the Athenians, resorts to the stale <lb/>
            device of asserting that it was irregularly and clandestinely obtained. <lb/>
            But it is far more likely, that the people of Athens upon further in­ <lb/>
            quiry and reflection became convinced, that the violent measures of <lb/>
            the Amphictyons were uncalled-for and unseasonable, that the affair <lb/>
            of Cirrha did not concern them, and the most prudent plan was <lb/>
            to keep themselves quiet, as Demosthenes advised.1 <note type="footnote"> (1) Mitford, who is always adverse to Demosthenes, thinks that his silence on the <lb/>
            subject of this charge proves his guilt. (History of Greece, iv. chap. xli. s. 5.) </note> <pb n="371"/>
             </p>
          <p>Of Æschines the least we can say is, that he acted with great <lb/>
            indiscretion, and showed himself not a very fit person to manage abv <lb/>
            important business of state. Whether he was stimulated by the <lb/>
            base motives which have been imputed to him, is a problem which <lb/>
            no mortal can solve. Difficulties present themselves, whatever view <lb/>
            we may be inclined to take. It can hardly be supposed that the course <lb/>
            which things took was planned by AEschines. for no one could have <lb/>
            foreseen that such results would flow from such causes, or that by <lb/>
            the contingency which happened Philip would get the advantages <lb/>
            which he did. Upon the Athenians declining to act against the <lb/>
            Locrians, Philip had no casus belli against them as Amphictyonic <lb/>
            leader, while he involved himself in a war with the Locrians, his <lb/>
            former allies, at the risk also of displeasing the Thebans. The only <lb/>
            compensation for this was, that he took the Athenians by surprise. It <lb/>
            may however be thought, that the event which actually happened was <lb/>
            not the most favourable one for Philip, who rather hoped that he should <lb/>
            embroil the Athenians with the Locrians, and step in himself as the <lb/>
            protector of the latter, drawing to his side the Thebans and other <lb/>
            allies. Yet one would imagine it would better have suited Philip's <lb/>
            purpose to get up a religious cry against the Athenians, so as to bring <lb/>
            them into odium and disgrace with the Amphictyons, and excite per­ <lb/>
            haps a Sacred war against them, of which he might have the conduct. <lb/>
            It is thus possible that the Locrian who declaimed so fiercely against <lb/>
            Athens at Delphi was acting under his instigation, and that the reply <lb/>
            of Æschines, made on the spur of the moment, accidentally turned the <lb/>
            wrath of the assembly into another channel. It is by no means im­ <lb/>
            possible however, that the Locrian and Æschines were both Macedo­ <lb/>
            nian hirelings ; yet that they had no definite object further than to <lb/>
            create discord and confusion among the Amphictyons, which Philip <lb/>
            might turn to his advantage according to circumstances. It is in <lb/>
            this vague way that Demosthenes shapes his accusation.1</p>
          <p>From a comparison of the two orators it appears, that the extraor­ <lb/>
            dinary meeting of Amphictyons was held at Thermopylae at the time <lb/>
            appointed, and attended by deputies from most of the states except <lb/>
            Athens and Thebes. Cottyphus, being elected general, summoned the <lb/>
            Amphictyonic tribes to take arms; their contingents however came <lb/>
            in slowly, and not in sufficient numbers for the required purpose. <lb/>
            Putting himself at the head of such force as he could muster, Cotty­ <lb/>
            phus made a show of opening the campaign; but, not being strong <lb/>
            enough to reduce the Locrians to submission, he contented himself <lb/>
            with imposing terms upon them, in particular a pecuniary fine to be <lb/>
            paid on an early day. These terms were not complied with; it was <note type="footnote"> (1) Demosthenes does not pretend to say, that Philip marked out any particular <lb/>
            course for Æschines or his other agents to pursue. Any war or confusion among <lb/>
            the Amphictyons would be a gain to him; for he was sure then to be wanted : </note> <figure type="illustration">

              never desired by Philips friends that they should be: accordingly <lb/>
              at the ensuing autumnal 1 congress of Amphictyons it was proposed, as <lb/>
              had been concerted by the Macedonian party, that Philip should be <lb/>
              invited to subdue and punish the refractory people, who had dared to <lb/>
              defy the general council of Greece. It does not appear by what <lb/>
              deputies this motion was supported, or whether or by whom it was <lb/>
              opposed: as however the tribes north of Thermopylæ formed a <lb/>
              majority in the council, it was certain to be carried in the affirmative. <lb/>
              Philip was invited; and eagerly embracing the opportunity, for <lb/>
              which doubtless he was well prepared, he set out with his army for <lb/>
              the south, proclaiming that he had taken arms in the cause of religion <lb/>
              as the Greeks had requested him. He was speedily joined by the <lb/>
              Thessalians and circumjacent tribes, and passing Thermopylae with a <lb/>
              force which neither the Locrians nor any single Grecian state could <lb/>
              have resisted, he entered the north-eastern part of the Phocian terri­ <lb/>
              tory. Had his sole purpose now been to prosecute the war which he <lb/>
              had professedly come to conduct against the Amphissian Locrians, <lb/>
              he would have pursued his march through Phocis towards their <lb/>
              frontier. Instead of doing so, he halted suddenly at Elatea, and <lb/>
              began to repair its ruined fortifications. By this step (as Elatea was <lb/>
              on the confine of Bœotia, and commanded the entrance to that <lb/>
              country) it became manifest, that his designs were against the <lb/>
              Athenians, or the Thebans, or both.</p>
          <p>How the Athenians viewed it, is plain enough from the celebrated <lb/>
            description of Demosthenes. Whether Philip was openly at war <lb/>
            with them or not, mattered but little. Had there been ten thousand <lb/>
            treaties of peace between them registered on stone, the result would <lb/>
            have been the same. Philip's approach was not the less dangerous, <lb/>
            because he had made no proclamation of hostility. He bad recent <lb/>
            failures to avenge, losses at sea, and insults to his coast. Yet these <lb/>
            were nothing compared with the intense desire which he felt to <lb/>
            strike a mortal blow at the power of Athens. It was indeed a neces­ <lb/>
            sity, unless he meant to forego his ambitious schemes. The moment <lb/>
            the Athenians received intelligence that he had occupied Elatea, the <lb/>
            whole truth flashed upon them at once. Here at length was that <lb/>
            terrible king of Macedon, whom Demosthenes had been so many <lb/>
            years alarming them about. He was now ready to fall upon Attica, <lb/>
            as he had fallen upon Olynthus; and where were they to look for <note type="footnote"> (1) Grote has taken the correct view of the chronology of these events. (See the <lb/>
            learned notes to his History of Greece, xi. pp. 657, 664.) The extraordinary congress <lb/>
            of Amphictyons was held at some time between the spring and autumn, but at what <lb/>
            particular time, does not appear. Philip was appointed general at the autumnal <lb/>
            meeting, <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰς τὴν ἐπιου̃σαν κυλαίαν</foreign>, (Demosth. De Coron. 277.) The <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐαρινη̃ς</foreign> <unclear>ωυλαίας</unclear> <lb/>
            in the second Amphictyonic decree (ibid. 278) is clearly a mistake, except upon the <lb/>
            improbable supposition that there were two decrees for the election of Philip, one in <lb/>
            the spring of 339 B. c., and one in the autumn. The records cited in the oration of <lb/>
            Demosthenes are certainly not to be relied on for their dates, if they are for anything <lb/>
            else. I see no evidence for supposing that Æschines advocated the appointment of <lb/>
            Philip. </note> <lb/>

            defence ? The whole city was paralysed, until Demosthenes came <lb/>
            forward to rouse the people from their stupor, and point out to them <lb/>
            what means of defence and what hope remained. The Athenians <lb/>
            were passive in his hands.</p>
          <p>I shall not seek to describe in language of my own those scenes of <lb/>
            excitement and terror, which are so vividly brought before our eyes <lb/>
            by Demosthenes himself. The circumstances under which he rose to <lb/>
            address his countrymen, his own counsel, and all the proceedings of <lb/>
            the popular assembly, are fully set forth in his most interesting narra­ <lb/>
            tive, to which I refer the reader.1 Suffice it here to say, that under his <lb/>
            advice, which was unanimously agreed to, a decree was drawn up,2 <lb/>
            offering alliance on the most honourable terms to the Thebans: an <lb/>
            embassy was despatched instantly to Thebes, with Demosthenes at its <lb/>
            head; and the Athenians with a full muster of their military strength <lb/>
            marched to Eleusis, in order to encourage their friends in Thebes, and <lb/>
            to second the efforts of the ambassadors.</p>
          <p>The advance of Philip into their neighbourhood was a thing by no <lb/>
            means welcome to the Thebans. They had signified their disapproval <lb/>
            of the late Amphictyonic movement by absenting themselves from <lb/>
            the special congress. The appointment of Philip to conduct the war <lb/>
            must have increased their uneasiness; and still more his fortification <lb/>
            of Elatea. 3 For some time past the Thebans had regarded Philip <lb/>
            with no friendly eye. They were oppressed by the weight of their <lb/>
            obligation to him, and felt a jealousy and a dread of his growing <lb/>
            power, which they dared not exhibit or express. His garrison at <lb/>
            Nicæa, which he had nominally given to the Thessalians, both gave <lb/>
            them offence and kept them in awe.4 He had taken possession of <lb/>
            Echinus, a town on the Malian gulf, which formerly belonged to <lb/>
            them.5 He had transferred to himself the Peloponnesian confederacy, <lb/>
            of which they had once been at the head.6 The relation in which <lb/>
            they stood to him was altogether painful and humiliating.7 Yet <lb/>
            whatever their grievances might be, there seemed no help for them : <lb/>
            they were isolated from all alliances except those which were devoted <lb/>
            to Philip. Athens was the only independent power to which they <note type="footnote"> (1) See ante, pp. 68—74. Orig. pp. 284—291. Diodorus, xvi. 84, has this descrip­ <lb/>
            tion before his eyes. </note><note type="footnote"> . (2) The decree cited in the oration (De Coron. 288—291) is clearly erroneous as to <lb/>
            the archon and the month; perhaps also in the number of ambassadors; for there are <lb/>
            only five, and Demosthenes had proposed ten. See Grote, History of Greece, xi. <lb/>
            673, note 2. As to the merits of the decree itself there is a difference of opinion <lb/>
            among critics. Schaefer and others think it verbose and inflated. (See ante, p. 72, <lb/>
            note 3.) Lord Brougham and the Edinburgh Reviewer (cited by me, ante, p. 76, <lb/>
            note 1,) think it a fine piece of composition. Grote considers it improbable that <lb/>
            intermarriage should be offered by the Athenians to the Thebans in that state of the <lb/>
            negotiation. But it was a great point with Demosthenes to make the most liberal <lb/>
            and friendly proposals. </note><note type="footnote"> (3) How this would be regarded at Thebes, appears from Demosthenes, Philipp. <lb/>

            could have recourse; but, though there gradually rose up at Thebes <lb/>
            a party favourable to the Athenian connexion, the prejudices against it <lb/>
            were for a long time so strong as to render it almost hopeless. Ancient <lb/>
            animosities had been increased by the events of the Sacred war, and <lb/>
            especially by the course which things had taken at its closed The <lb/>
            Thebans had reason to complain of Athens for her intrigues with <lb/>
            Philip, the violent language of her orators, and her endeavours to <lb/>
            dismember Boeotia; while they were conscious that the retention of <lb/>
            Oropus. was an act of injustice on their own part.2 Since the peace <lb/>
            there had been little intercourse between the two cities. Border dis­ <lb/>
            putes had arisen, and troops were sent to guard the frontiers, though <lb/>
            without leading to any actual conflict.3 The inscription on the <lb/>
            Athenian offerings at Delphi, whatever may have been the motive <lb/>
            which prompted it, was an act hurtful to national feelings, and likely <lb/>
            to aggravate Theban ill-will to Athens.4</p>
          <p>There had long been at Athens a party anxious for reconciliation <lb/>
            with the Thebans ; but it had not been popular. Æschines reproaches <lb/>
            Demosthenes for belonging to it.6 Since the spring meeting of the <lb/>
            Amphictyons this party had been gaining strength, chiefly through <lb/>
            the exertions of Demosthenes, who foresaw danger to Athens from <lb/>
            the disturbances which had taken place at Delphic Divers embassies <lb/>
            were about this time sent to Thebes, conducted by statesmen sup­ <lb/>
            posed to be most popular in that city. They were instructed (we <lb/>
            may fairly presume) to offer an explanation of the affair of the <lb/>
            shields-to sound the Thebans as to their views of the new religious <lb/>
            question which had been agitated-to appease any hostile feeling <lb/>
            which might have sprung up against themselves-and lastly, when <lb/>
            the Amphictyons had passed the fatal decree which invited Philip <lb/>
            into Greece, to bring about, if possible, a defensive alliance between <lb/>
            Thebes and Athens. Meanwhile however all these attempts were <lb/>
            counterworked by an opposite party. Philip kept his spies and <lb/>
            agents in both cities, who informed him of all that was going on.7 <lb/>
            Whilst he lay in apparent inaction at Pella, recovering from his <lb/>
            wound, he was labouring by every engine of diplomacy to defeat the <lb/>
            Athenian negotiations, and prevent a conjunction which might put <lb/>
            a check upon all his ambitious schemes. And so well did he manage <lb/>
            things, with the help of his ministers and partisans; so artfully did <note type="footnote"> (1) Demosthenes, De Coron. 237.</note><note type="footnote"> (2) See ante, pp. 257, 299, 300, 303. </note><note type="footnote"> (3) Demosthenes, De Fals.

            he work on the jealousies, the hopes, and the fears of the Theban <lb/>
            people, that they were induced to pass decrees in his favour, reject­ <lb/>
            ing the overtures of the Athenians: and when Philip set out on his <lb/>
            march, it seemed impossible that any union could take place between <lb/>
            Thebes and Athens.1 In one thing however he failed. The Thebans <lb/>
            refused to send any aid to the Amphictyonic expedition. They desired <lb/>
            neutrality and peace.2</p>
          <p>At length Demosthenes and his colleagues arrived at Thebes. <lb/>
            Philip's ambassadors were already there, together with those of his <lb/>
            allies, Thessalians, Ænianians, Ætolians, Dolopians, Phthiots. The <lb/>
            Macedonian party were full of confidence, the friends of Athens in <lb/>
            despondence and alarm. Demosthenes at first, seeing how things <lb/>
            stood, sent discouraging letters to Athens; but he quickly collected <lb/>
            his energies to meet the exigency of the case. It was plain, the <lb/>
            confidence of his adversaries was owing not merely to the assurances <lb/>
            which the Thebans had lately given of their adhesion to the Mace­ <lb/>
            donian alliance, but in a great measure also to the presence of Philip <lb/>
            and his army. This however might operate in two ways. It intimi­ <lb/>
            dated the people; yet it also suggested thoughts favourable to a <lb/>
            union with Athens. So long as Philip kept himself at a distance, the <lb/>
            Thebans were content to be quiet, and not provoke his hostility by <lb/>
            forming new connexions. But if they were not to have the benefits <lb/>
            of peace; if their territory was to be traversed by Philip's armies, <lb/>
            or be made the theatre of war; and still more, if he designed to coerce <lb/>
            them by keeping a strongly garrisoned fortress on their borders ; his <lb/>
            alliance was no longer the advantageous thing which it promised <lb/>
            to be in the beginning. Such thoughts were sure to arise in the <lb/>
            breasts of the Theban multitude, who had no corrupt interest in <lb/>
            Philip's friendship : and of these Demosthenes prepared to take <lb/>
            advantage.3</p>
          <p>A popular assembly was held, to consider whether the proposal of <lb/>
            Philip or that of the Athenians should be accepted. The ambassadors <lb/>
            on both sides were introduced to the people. The Macedonians, <lb/>
            holding already the character of allies, were allowed to have the first <lb/>
            word.4 They extolled the merits of the king of Macedon, enlarged <lb/>

            Thebes and Athens, the many injuries which the Athenians had <unclear>1i1</unclear> <lb/>
            a long series of years inflicted upon the Theban people. Now was <lb/>
            the time, they said, for the Thebans to show their gratitude to Philip, <lb/>
            and take vengeance upon long-standing enemies. But if they were <lb/>
            unwilling to join in the invasion of Attica, Philip would be satisfied <lb/>
            with their neutrality: let them only allow a passage to his army, and <lb/>
            he would himself chastise the Athenians. If Philip had asked this <lb/>
            of them before he lent them his aid in the Sacred war, they would <lb/>
            have promised it easily: it would be unjust to refuse it because <lb/>
            Philip had been generous and relied upon their honour.' By ad­ <lb/>
            hering to Philip's friendship they had everything to gain; their own <lb/>
            country would be secure, and they would share in the plunder of <lb/>
            Attica; whereas, if they joined the Athenians, Bœotia would be <lb/>
            exposed to warfare and pillage.'</p>
          <p>Demosthenes rose to combat these arguments. Not a fragment of <lb/>
            his speech is preserved. In the oration on the Crown he discreetly <lb/>
            abstained from repeating any portion of it to the jury; as, however <lb/>
            gratifying the recital might nave been to his own feelings, it could at <lb/>
            that time have answered no useful purpose. The position of affairs <lb/>
            suggests to us the topics upon which he must have principally dwelt; <lb/>
            and the substance of what he said may have been as follows :-</p>
          <p>Men of Thebes, if this were a question only of punishing Athens, <lb/>
            or even of destroying her, I might never have ventured to address <lb/>
            this assembly. But it is a question which deeply concerns you and <lb/>
            your own safety. Thebes is in no less danger than Athens; and as <lb/>
            the Athenians would consider your subjection to Philip as one of the <lb/>
            greatest calamities to themselves, such they conceive should be your <lb/>
            feelings with regard to Athens. For if (which heaven forbid!) we <lb/>
            should be disabled from lending assistance to you in the hour of need, <lb/>
            what alliance, what protection will remain to you ? All your Pelo­ <lb/>
            ponnesian confederates have gone over to Philip. He commands the <lb/>
            pass of Thermopylae. He has surrounded you with his garrisons. <lb/>
            The Thessalians, all the tribes of Pindus and Olympus, Data and <lb/>
            Othrys, are devoted to him. Why do they come to invade Attica, <lb/>
            and what mean they by this present embassy P We have no quarrel <lb/>
            with the people of Thessaly, or with the Ætolians or Œtæans or any <lb/>
            of them. They follow the king of Macedon against us, because they <lb/>
            are his vassals; and they come here to dictate to you, what votes <lb/>
            you shall give to-day. Dolopians and Perrhæbians would compel <lb/>
            you, a free people, to render the same obedience to Philip which they <lb/>
            are content to pay themselves. Their very presence here is an insult; <lb/>
            and the whole conduct of Philip proves the light estimation in which <note type="footnote">(1) Aristotle, Rhetor. ii. 23. 6. Philochorus, apud Dionysium ad Amm. s. 11, <lb/>

            he regards you. His envoys have reminded you of the obligations <lb/>
            which you are under to him, and demand that they should be requited. <lb/>
            The merit of an obligation depends on the motives of the party who <lb/>
            confers it. Philip has shown, that the aid which he lent you was to <lb/>
            further his own ambitious schemes and to make you subservient to <lb/>
            them. There can be no gratitude, where there is no equality. He <lb/>
            imagines that, having once assisted you, he is entitled to treat you <lb/>
            as his inferiors. If he regarded you as allies on equal terms, he <lb/>
            would have consulted you before his march; he would have asked <lb/>
            leave for a passage through your territory before he approached the <lb/>
            frontier. He has come without your permission, intending to make <lb/>
            Bœotia the marching-road for his army; and he is now fortifying a <lb/>
            post on your confines, in order to intimidate you. His conduct <lb/>
            agrees with the language of his ministers. They threaten Bceotia <lb/>
            with pillage, if you dare to refuse compliance with his will. The <lb/>
            occupation of Elatea is the strongest proof, what Philip's opinion is <lb/>
            both of himself and you. It proves that he distrusts you, that he <lb/>
            regards you as doubtful friends; and for the best of all reasons, be­ <lb/>
            cause he is conscious that he deserves not your friendship. It is but <lb/>
            a short step from a suspicious ally to a declared enemy. At this <lb/>
            very moment you are esteemed in no other light than as enemies, to <lb/>
            be crushed on the first favourable opportunity. It is enough that <lb/>
            you have deliberated about alliance with Athens; this alone he will <lb/>
            never forgive: he expects from every people an unconditional and <lb/>
            unhesitating obedience. Bethink you, how be treated the unhappy <lb/>
            Olynthians. They assisted him against Athens; they helped him to <lb/>
            deprive us of our Thracian dominions: yet notwithstanding this he <lb/>
            attacked them without any provocation, and razed their city to the <lb/>
            ground. Philip's enmity is the more to be dreaded, when it is not <lb/>
            open and avowed. Every Grecian city is infested by his spies and <lb/>
            agents. Among you, as among us, there are miscreants who would <lb/>
            sell their country to Philip, that they may rule in it by his influence. <lb/>
            These are the men who have hitherto contrived by their artifices to <lb/>
            keep you and the Athenians asunder. They know that citizens of a <lb/>
            free republic are the natural allies of the Theban people, whereas <lb/>
            Philip will help his own hirelings to oppress their fellow-countrymen. <lb/>
            Philip has the same motive for overthrowing your commonwealth <lb/>
            that he has for destroying ours; for we both set an example of free­ <lb/>
            dom to the other Greek states, which is an obstacle in his way to <lb/>
            empire. But he declares no war against Thebes. He would be <lb/>
            foolish to do so, if he can gain his objects without it. There will be <lb/>
            no necessity for war, if, as he seems to expect, you submit to his <lb/>
            commands without a murmur. If you are inclined, like us, to dispute <lb/>
            Macedonian supremacy, then he considers it better to deal first with <lb/>
            us, and with you on a more convenient occasion. It is thus that <lb/>
            be proceeds step by step to reduce every Greek city to subjection. <lb/>
            Can you be blind to his projects ? Or are you afraid to resist them ? <lb/>
             <pb n="378"/>
            I know not whether he calculates on your credulity or your fears. He <lb/>
            came hither under a religious pretence, to chastise the Locrians for <lb/>
            sacrilege: he never told the Amphictyons, whom he summoned to <lb/>
            join his standard, that he was about to lead them against Attica: not <lb/>
            till he is within two days' march of our frontier, does he avow his <lb/>
            real object. Who can safely trust a man, who thus ever dissembles <lb/>
            his plans, till they are ripe for execution? Honour and good faith, <lb/>
            which prevent other people from committing acts of wanton aggression, <lb/>
            are no manner of restraint to Philip. He pays an ill compliment to <lb/>
            your state, by supposing that you will aid and abet liim in his <lb/>
            treachery. It is plain, he imagines you are no longer the soldiers of <lb/>
            Leuctra: he ranks you already among his dependents. Let him see <lb/>
            that he is mistaken in his estimate. Prove to the Greeks, that you <lb/>
            have the courage to stand up for their independence and your own. <lb/>
            No middle course is open to you. These envoys indeed say, that <lb/>
            Philip will be content with your giving him a passage through <lb/>
            Bœotia. Mark the insidious nature of their argument, and the con­ <lb/>
            tempt which it shows of the Theban people. If the Thebans (they <lb/>
            say) are unwilling to share with Philip the dangers of the field, he <lb/>
            kindly permits them to stay at home. Why, if the war with Athens <lb/>
            were just and beneficial to Thebes, and Philip had for the Theban <lb/>
            people that respect which he ought to have, he would not be satisfied <lb/>
            without their hearty cooperation. But he knows it is a war which <lb/>
            by aggrandizing him must injure you; and therefore he tempts you <lb/>
            to your ruin by offering you this base alternative. His orators are in­ <lb/>
            structed to suggest this timorous counsel, in the hope that you will sacri- <lb/>
            See your country to the desire of present ease. If Philip can succeed <lb/>
            without your help, flatter not yourselves that you can be neutral <lb/>
            with impunity. No! You must either be with us for Greece, or <lb/>
            with Philip against her. If corrupt statesmen have already acquired <lb/>
            such influence over your counsels, that they can persuade you to for­ <lb/>
            get what is due to yourselves, and to disregard the dignity of the <lb/>
            commonwealth, hearken to the call of Philip, obey his summons to <lb/>
            arms, follow him to the walls of Athens, and be content, like <lb/>
            Dolopians and Perrhæbians, to be the subjects of a prince whom <lb/>
            Pelopidas brought as a hostage to Thebes. But if you would rather <lb/>
            imitate those gallant men who raised your country to greatness and <lb/>
            renown, then join with us in resisting an aggressor who comes to <lb/>
            despoil us of all that is most dear and valuable. You have now the <lb/>
            opportunity, which may never come again, of defending Hellenic <lb/>
            liberty against barbarism, of blotting out other painful memories in <lb/>
            the glory of one heroic struggle for your fatherland. Arouse ye then, <lb/>
            men of Thebes! Let the spirit of Epaminondas awaken in the <lb/>
            bosom of every man sentiments worthy of his country. The <lb/>
            Athenians will fight by your side. They that helped you when the <lb/>
            Spartan had seized your acropolis, will not desert you now. Are <lb/>
            there any in this assembly who look on'Philip as invincible? Have <lb/>
             <pb n="379"/>
            we not driven him in confusion from the walls of Perinthus and <lb/>
            Byzantium? Have we not expelled his tyrants from Eretria and <lb/>
            Oreus ? And shall we not now chase him from your frontiers, from <lb/>
            the strongholds which he has chosen for his sallying-places against <lb/>
            the Greeks? What need of many words? Our troops are already <lb/>
            at Eleusis: at your call they will march to Thebes, and enable you <lb/>
            to bid defiance to this man who now so insolently threatens you. <lb/>
            Nor do we stand alone in the conflict. Achaia, Corinth, Megara, <lb/>
            other states are our allies, who will not permit the sacred soil of <lb/>
            Greece to be trampled on by a barbarian. But if you, men of Thebes, <lb/>
            adopt that course which your true welfare requires, the war will <lb/>
            speedily be brought to an issue. For when Philip sees that Athens <lb/>
            and Thebes are firmly united, he will lower his arrogance, he will <lb/>
            yield, as he did at Byzantium, to a combination too powerful for him <lb/>
            to conquer. His hopes are founded on our discord. Let that cease; <lb/>
            and he will retire in haste to Macedonia. That you, men of Thebes, <lb/>
            understand your duties, and that all which I have said is in accord­ <lb/>
            ance with your own honest judgment, I know full well. There is <lb/>
            but one thing which gives me any anxiety: the remembrance of those <lb/>
            jealousies which have divided us, and which have brought so many <lb/>
            evils upon Athens and upon you and the rest of the Greeks. They <lb/>
            indeed would have long since died away, but for the traitors in <lb/>
            both cities, who, bribed by the gold of Macedonia, have made it their <lb/>
            business to foment and keep them alive. It is these persons that <lb/>
            you should view with jealousy and suspicion; aye, that you should <lb/>
            execrate and abhor: and when they appear to support by their voice <lb/>
            or their presence the foreigner who has hired their services, let them <lb/>
            see by unmistakeable signs, that you know them, and that you will <lb/>
            not suffer yourselves to be deceived and betrayed. The people of <lb/>
            Athens have by this resolution, which has been read to you, deliberately <lb/>
            recorded the feelings with which they regard the people of Thebes. <lb/>
            It is their sincerest wish, that all former animosities be buried in <lb/>
            amnesty and oblivion. They will remember only the mutual kindnesses <lb/>
            which have passed between you; and that the Thebans are Greeks of <lb/>
            the same nation as themselves, for whose dignity and prosperity they <lb/>
            will consult as they would for their own. They offer you alliance, <lb/>
            friendship, brotherhood. I conjure and implore you, men of Thebes, <lb/>
            to receive this solemn act of the Athenian people in the same spirit <lb/>
            in which it was decreed. You have heard from my lips the sentiments <lb/>
            of my countrymen; and with a few more words I shall have dis­ <lb/>
            charged my duty. Be assured, 0 ye Thebans, that union with <lb/>
            Athens brings you security and honour; connexion with Macedonia <lb/>
            is but another name for servitude. You are about to give your votes <lb/>
            on a question of the deepest moment to yourselves and your posterity. <lb/>
            May the gods so direct your counsels that you may decide as becomes <lb/>
            Greeks and free men!</p>
          <p>These and other arguments, expanded into the glowing language <lb/>
             <pb n="380"/>
            and delivered with the energy of Demosthenes, carried the day. <lb/>
            The Thebans voted alliance with Athens, and invited her troops into <lb/>
            the city. A large body of their own civic force was encamped with­ <lb/>
            out the walls, while the Athenians were quartered in their houses <lb/>
            among their women and children, and received with the kindest <lb/>
            hospitality, of which by their strict discipline and good behaviour <lb/>
            they proved themselves fully worthy. It is touching to see these <lb/>
            two people, late such deadly foes, now in the expiring day of Grecian <lb/>
            freedom united as friends and brothers, preparing to issue forth to <lb/>
            their last common battle-field, and to shed their blood together in the <lb/>
            same sacred cause.1</p>
          <p>AEschines, in the impotence of his malice, will not allow to his <lb/>
            adversary the least share of merit in the success of this negotiation; <lb/>
            urging that it was the force of circumstances, and not the eloquence <lb/>
            of Demosthenes, which prevailed upon the Thebans to take the side <lb/>
            of Athens. This wretched piece of sophistry, which it is not worth <lb/>
            while to refute, has not found much favour either at Athens or <lb/>
            elsewhere. Modern readers of history lament only that a speech which <lb/>
            achieved so signal a triumph has been lost.2</p>
          <p>At the time when all the Athenians were rejoicing in the consumma­ <lb/>
            tion of the Theban alliance, Æschines never muttered a word of com­ <lb/>
            plaint against it; but long afterwards he found cause of reproach against <lb/>
            his rival in the terms of the treaty, which he contended were too <lb/>
            favourable to Thebes. It was agreed, he says, that the Athenians <lb/>
            should assist the Thebans in maintaining their sovereignty over <lb/>
            Bœotia ; that two thirds of the expenses of the war were to be <lb/>
            defrayed by Athens; that the command at sea was to be shared be­ <lb/>
            tween the two countries, though Athens was to pay the whole <lb/>
            expense; and the supreme command by land was given virtually to <lb/>
            Thebes: there could be no necessity for making such concessions, <lb/>
            because the Thebans were in much greater peril than the Athenians, <lb/>
            and were only too glad to obtain their succour. To all this however <lb/>
            Demosthenes himself furnishes a complete answer; that it was <lb/>
            neither prudent nor possible, to stand bargaining about conditions, <lb/>
            when Philip was ready to outbid them, and when there was not a <note type="footnote"> (1) Demosthenes, De Coron. 299, 300. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) Machines, Contr. Ctesiph. 73. He says also here, that the Thebans sent for <lb/>
            the Athenians to join them, before Demosthenes proposed one word of a decree for an <lb/>
            alliance. Of course the treaty was not finally decreed until the return of Demo­ <lb/>
            sthenes from Thebes. But Æschines insinuates something more. Demosthenes <lb/>
            frequently boasted of his triumph at Thebes, and not without reason. See De Coron. <lb/>
            278, 288, 308. His remarks in p. 298 are most just and forcible—that Æschines, <lb/>
            while he allowed him no credit as an orator or an adviser, attributed to him all the <lb/>
            failures in the war. Compare Dinarchus, Contr. Demosth. 91. Plutarch, in Vit <lb/>
            Demosth. 18, cites the words of Theopompus: To <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὲν οὖν συμφέρον</foreign> ou <foreign xml:lang="grc">διέφυγε τους</foreign> </note> <figure type="illustration">

              moment to be lost. We may add, that a liberal and generous policy <lb/>
              was not only the best means for securing the immediate object, but <lb/>
              the wisest thing also for the future, that there might be an end to <lb/>
              the jealousies which had so long kept Thebes and Athens at <lb/>
              variance.1</p>
          <p>The Thebans having thus decided in favour of alliance with Athens, <lb/>
            both sides prepared for war. Of the events of the war a very im­ <lb/>
            perfect description is given us in the few ancient works that remain. <lb/>
            Of English historians Grote is the only one who has taken a correct <lb/>
            view of the campaign. Others, misled by the brevity of Diodorus, and <lb/>
            also by the records cited in the oration on the Crown, have conceived <lb/>
            that the whole war occupied but two months, from Scirophorion to <lb/>
            Metagitnion (June to August), 338 B.C. It has been already noticed, <lb/>
            how inaccurate Diodorus is in the connexion and general outline of <lb/>
            history. Not only does he omit many important events, but he ob­ <lb/>
            serves no proportion of length and brevity in his narrative, sometimes <lb/>
            wearying us with prolixity of description, at other times cutting short <lb/>
            matters about which we are curious to obtain further information. <lb/>
            And as to the records in the published editions of the oration on the <lb/>
            Crown, we have seen that the dates are incorrect; and if this be so, <lb/>
            it is impossible to draw from them any conclusions which are opposed <lb/>
            to other and better evidence. From the comparison of various pas­ <lb/>
            sages in Demosthenes, AEschines, Dinarchus, Pausanias, Plutarch, <lb/>
            and Polyænus, it appears beyond all question, that a protracted war <lb/>
            was carried on in Phocis, Amphissian Locris, and Bceotia; during <lb/>
            which there was much manoeuvring on both sides, and three or four <lb/>
            battles were fought before that of Chæronea with various success, <lb/>
            one of them occurring in the winter season;3 that Amphissa was <lb/>
            taken by Philip; that embassies were sent to Peloponnesus and other <lb/>
            parts of Greece both by Philip and his adversaries, and the latter <lb/>
            succeeded in obtaining auxiliaries; that negotiations for peace were <lb/>
            opened by Philip; and that the Athenians and their allies exerted <lb/>
            themselves to reassemble the scattered population of Phocis, and to <note type="footnote"> (1) AEschines, Contr. Ctesiph. 73, 74. Demosthenes, De Coron. 306, 307. A crown <lb/>

            " The narrative of Diodorus seems to imply that, before the competition of oratory <lb/>
            between Python and Demosthenes at Thebes, the army of the Athenian confederacy <lb/>
            had taken that station near Chæronea which it occupied to the time of the decisive <lb/>
            battle. But Diodorus, abridging greatly, and perhaps often writing from memory, <lb/>
            not unfrequently manages narratives so that it is difficult to guess whether he intends <lb/>
            that the reader should take what precedes or what follows as prior in time; and he <lb/>
            still oftener omits, as here, to notice intervening transactions necessary to connect <lb/>
            parts of his story." It is fair to state, that Mitford has not fallen into the error of <lb/>
            omitting the winter and autumnal campaign : (ibid. as. 4, 5.) </note><note type="footnote"> (3) Demosthenes, De Coron. 300: <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τὰς πρώτας μάχας, τήν τ' έπὶ του̃ ποταμου̃ καὶ</foreign> <lb/>
            Clinton (Fasti Hellenic!, 271), in order to make this square with his <lb/>
            chronology, says: "The word <foreign xml:lang="grc">χειμερινήν</foreign> is probably corrupt; perhaps capable of <lb/>
            another interpretation." It has accordingly been interpreted to mean "the battle of <lb/>

            fortify some of their more important towns. All this argues not <lb/>
            only extended military operations, but diplomatic proceedings, coun­ <lb/>
            cils of war, plans, preparations, and arrangements, requiring a much <lb/>
            longer period of time than what Clinton and those who follow him <lb/>
            allow to the campaign of Chæronea. That Philip began his march <lb/>
            from Macedonia soon after the autumnal congress of B.C. 339, at <lb/>
            which he was appointed to be Amphictyonic general, and that the <lb/>
            war lasted for ten or eleven months from that time to the August of <lb/>
            the following year, is the opinion of Grote, formed upon a juster view <lb/>
            of the historical data which are left us.'</p>
          <p>Philip, disappointed of that success at Thebes which he had reason <lb/>
            to expect, redoubled his efforts to procure assistance from the Pelo­ <lb/>
            ponnesians. They had already been requested to send contingents <lb/>
            in aid of the religious war against Amphissa; but none of them bad <lb/>
            complied with the summons. His letters were now more pressing, <lb/>
            yet not more successful than before. None of the Peloponnesians <lb/>
            could be deceived by the religious plea which Philip set up; for they <lb/>
            speedily heard the truth from the envoys on the other side; and the <lb/>
            members of the old Theban confederacy would naturally be reluctant <lb/>
            to make war upon their former ally, with whom they had had no <lb/>
            quarrel. 2 In the meantime Philip remained at Elatea, which he bad <lb/>
            chosen for the base of his operations ; and we may presume that he <lb/>
            employed himself in strengthening his position, while he awaited the <lb/>
            arrival of reinforcements.</p>
          <p>Nor was Demosthenes idle. After arranging the terms of alliance <lb/>
            at Thebes, he returned to Athens, and immediately passed a decree <lb/>
            to ratify the treaty. He despatched embassies to the Peloponnesian <lb/>
            and other cities, to solicit succour: he went in person to some of <lb/>
            them, and obtained considerable success. Aid was promised by the <lb/>
            Achæans, Corinthians, Megarians, Eubœans, Leucadians, and Cor­ <lb/>
            cyræans. Contributions in money were furnished by some states, <lb/>
            and a large body of mercenaries was levied. a An unwonted vigour <lb/>
            was infused into the Athenian administration. The spirit of the <lb/>
            people rose to meet the peril which hung over them. Under <lb/>
            the advice of Demosthenes, they suspended some works that were <lb/>
            going on for the improvement of the docks and arsenal; and they <lb/>
            gave a still stronger proof of their warlike zeal, by repealing the Jaw <lb/>
            of Eubulus, and allowing the theoric fund to be used for the pur- <note type="footnote"> (1) Grote, History of Greece, xi. p. 683. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) Demosthenes, De Coron. 279, 301, 302. The letters which Demosthenes refers <lb/>

            first successes of the allies against Philip. But it is impossible to rely upon such a <lb/>
            argument. Philip's letters would never have disclosed that he had been defeated. <lb/>
            The date was sufficiently vague for Demosthenes to refer them to the period which <lb/>
            suited his purpose. That none of the Peloponnesians joined Philip, appears from <lb/>
            Pausanias. See ante, p. 361. </note><note type="footnote"> (3) Demosthenes, De Coron. 306. Æschines, Contr. Ctesiph. 74, allows that ten <lb/>

            poses of war. Thus was accomplished, under the pressure of stern <lb/>
            necessity, a measure which Demosthenes had long in vain recom­ <lb/>
            mended. He was now (in all but military talents) the Pericles of the <lb/>
            day : an energetic and powerful war-minister, counselling, directing, <lb/>
            animating all.1</p>
          <p>Having completed all those measures of preparation which required <lb/>
            his presence at Athens or elsewhere, Demosthenes hastened back to <lb/>
            Thebes, to assist at the councils of war. Such was the zeal and <lb/>
            ability which he had displayed, that even the Theban commanders <lb/>
            paid the highest deference to his judgment. Doubtless he was in­ <lb/>
            competent to give advice on the details of military tactics; yet in <lb/>
            concerting the plan of a campaign many questions might arise which <lb/>
            required the help of a statesman and diplomatist. So entirely was <lb/>
            Demosthenes identified with the cause, that he would spare himself <lb/>
            no personal labour where he could be useful, and would leave nothing <lb/>
            to be done by others which he thought he could do better himself. <lb/>
            AEschines, who charges him with mischievous interference, admits <lb/>
            that his influence was great both in the assembly and in the camp.2</p>
          <p>One of the first measures determined on by the allies was, to re­ <lb/>
            establish the Phocian people, and to put their country in a state of <lb/>
            security against Philip. It has been related how at the end of the <lb/>
            Sacred war the Phocian cities were destroyed, their population dis­ <lb/>
            persed into villages, and large numbers of men driven into exile. <lb/>
            The country was at this time in a perfectly defenceless condition, <lb/>
            having neither a force of its own to resist invasion, nor shelter for <lb/>
            a protecting army. The Thebans, who had been so instrumental in <lb/>
            the depression of their neighbours, now repented of the mischief <lb/>
            which they had done, and exerted themselves to repair it. This (says <lb/>
            Grote)3 evinced on their part the adoption of an improved and <lb/>
            generous policy, worthy of the Panhellenic cause in which they had <lb/>
            embarked. They marched with the Athenians into Phocis, restored <lb/>
            the ruined cities wherever it was practicable, and brought back the <lb/>
            scattered inhabitants: in some cases uniting together several com­ <lb/>
            munities, which would have been too weak to defend themselves <lb/>
            singly. The work of restoration was complete and permanent. <lb/>
            Ambrysus, a city in the south-western part of Phocis, commanding <lb/>
            one of the passes into Bceotia, was fortified with a double wall of <note type="footnote"> (1) Philochorus, apud Dionysium ad Amm. xi. p. 742. Demosthenes, De Coron. <lb/>

              and Thebans must have held the command of the Phocian territory <lb/>
              That Philip however did not leave them wholly undisturbed, we maj <lb/>
              infer from the mention of two engagements--one called the battl&lt; <lb/>
              by the river, another the winter battle; in which, according to Demo <lb/>
              sihenes, the allies had so much the advantage, as to afford occasion <lb/>
              for public rejoicings and thanksgiving at Athens.2</p>
          <p>It was perhaps in the spring of B.C. 338 that Philip, either having <lb/>
            serious misgivings about the issue of the contest, or, which is mort <lb/>
            probable, with the intention of misleading his adversaries or dis <lb/>
            tracing their counsels, sent proposals of peace to Thebes. The <lb/>
            Bœotarchs were inclined to consider them favourably, but were op <lb/>
            posed by Demosthenes, whose counsel prevailed with the Thebans <lb/>
            and caused them to reject Philip's overtures. So far we may safel <lb/>
            credit the statement of Æschines, who however goes on to charg <lb/>
            his rival with the most unseemly conduct; viz. that he jumped up i <lb/>
            the Theban assembly before the question had even been introduced <lb/>
            and swore that, if any one advised the making of peace with Philip <lb/>
            he would seize him by the hair and carry him to prison: and that <lb/>
            when the Theban magistrates had ordered the return of some Athe <lb/>
            nian troops for the express purpose of deliberating on the questioi <lb/>
            of peace, Demosthenes became quite out of his mind, denounced the <lb/>
            Bœotarchs as traitors to the cause of Greece, and said he woull <lb/>
            advise his countrymen to send an embassy to Thebes and ask to <lb/>
            a passage through Bœotia to attack Philip: and that by such menac <lb/>
            he forced the Thebans to continue the war. All these additions w <lb/>
            may set down to the malice of the accuser. Whether Demosthene <lb/>
            acted imprudently in dissuading all pacific negotiations, we are unabll <lb/>
            to judge, for want of knowing the circumstances. If there was <lb/>
            chance of obtaining a real peace, it might have been advisable t&lt; <lb/>
            treat with Philip. But if he was trying to negotiate separately will <lb/>
            Thebes, with a view to create disunion or dissension between the <lb/>
            allies, or if he was manoeuvring to gain time or any other advantage <lb/>
            and if there was any danger that the allies would fall into the snare <lb/>
            we can only say, that Demosthenes by defeating Philip's craft <lb/>
            design acquired an additional claim to the gratitude of his country.' <note type="footnote"> (1) Pausanias, x. chaps. 3, 33, 36; iv. 31. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) Demosthenes, De Coron. 300. There is no occasion to suppose with Reiske <lb/>

            was only a division of the Athenian troops that were sent back: as to the purpos <lb/>

             </p>
          <p>The first advantage obtained by Philip over the allies was in forcing <lb/>
            his way to Amphissa. It was important for him to accomplish the <lb/>
            original object for which the Amphictyons had invited him into <lb/>
            Greece. It would have discredited him with many of his followers, <lb/>
            if he made it. appear that he had come on a false pretence, or if he <lb/>
            allowed himself to be baffled in his original purpose; whereas, if he <lb/>
            succeeded in it, they would be encouraged to assist him in his own <lb/>
            private enterprises. The road from Delphi to Amphissa, probably <lb/>
            that which Philip took, traversed the declivities of Parnassus. The <lb/>
            defence of it was entrusted to Chares and the Theban Proxenus, who <lb/>
            commanded a large body of mercenaries furnished by the Athenians. <lb/>
            They occupied the entrance of a defile, which they could have de­ <lb/>
            fended against very superior numbers. Philip, in order to draw them <lb/>
            from their strong position, forged a letter from himself to Antipater, <lb/>
            stating that he had postponed his expedition to Amphissa, and was <lb/>
            about to march instantly for Thrace, where be heard the people were <lb/>
            rising. He contrived that this letter should fall into the hands of <lb/>
            the enemy. Chares and Proxenus, deceived by its contents, neglected <lb/>
            their guard of the pass: upon which Philip, marching through without <lb/>
            opposition, surprised and routed their army, and afterwards made <lb/>
            himself master of Amphissa.1 Æschines bitterly reproaches Demo­ <lb/>
            sthenes for having lent the mercenaries to the Ampbissians, and for <lb/>
            having thus divided the forces of the allies, and enabled Philip <lb/>
            to attack and defeat them separately. For this there may be better <lb/>
            ground than for most of his charges. The defeat of the merce­ <lb/>
            naries was a severe loss and discouragement to the allies, and <lb/>
            perhaps it might have been avoided by keeping the whole army <lb/>
            together. While the generals are chargeable with the immediate <lb/>
            miscarriage, it is very possible that the plan of operations was badly <lb/>
            designed.2</p>
          <p>Philip, having inflicted due punishment on the vanquished people <lb/>
            of Amphissa,3 and having thus performed his promise to the Amphic­ <lb/>

            Bœotian. A reinforcement may have been on its way from Athens, which the <lb/>
            Bœotarchs ordered to return, with a request that the Athenians would deliberate <lb/>
            on the question of peace. That they did deliberate appears from Plutarch, (Vit. <lb/>

            resolved vigorously to push the war against the Athenians and <lb/>
            Thebans. The intermediate steps are unknown to us. It appears <lb/>
            however, that shortly after the midsummer of 338 B.C., by which <lb/>
            time he had received strong reinforcements from Macedonia, he was <lb/>
            in a condition to strike a decisive blow. The allies, after the loss <lb/>
            which they had sustained, retreated from Phocis, and took up a de­ <lb/>
            fensive position in Bœotia ; whither Philip speedily followed them, <lb/>
            taking (as it seems) the easiest road which led by the vale of the <lb/>
            Cephisus from Panopeus to Chæronea.1 Finding that they were <lb/>
            posted on a hill commanding one of the passes, he began to ravage <lb/>
            and plunder the adjacent country; upon which the allies quitted <lb/>
            their vantage-ground, and descended into the plain to offer him <lb/>
            battle.2 They met not far from Chæronea ; Philip encamping on the <lb/>
            banks of the Cephisus, the Greeks near the temple of Hercules on a <lb/>
            stream called Hæmon. Plutarch says, he remembered an oak near the <lb/>
            Cephisus, which the people of the country called Alexander's oak, <lb/>
            because his tent was pitched under it.3 Philip's army numbered above <lb/>
            thirty thousand foot, and two thousand horse, consisting of Mace­ <lb/>
            donians and troops from Thessaly and the north. The allied army, <lb/>
            composed of Athenians, Thebans, Achæans, Corinthians and Pho­ <lb/>
            cians, were, according to Diodorus, inferior in number; according to <lb/>
            Justin, greatly superior. The chief difference lay in the quality of <lb/>
            the troops and the commanders.4</p>
          <p>The Macedonians had never yet fairly tried their strength against <lb/>
            the best troops of southern Greece. Philip had frequently encountered <lb/>
            small bodies of the Athenians in Thrace and Macedonia, and had <lb/>
            generally, but not always, overcome them. He bad defeated the <lb/>
            standing armv of Onomarchus; superior on the whole to any which <lb/>
            a single Greek state could have brought into the field, yet consisting <lb/>
            chiefly of mercenaries, not animated (it might be thought) with the <lb/>
            spirit of citizen-soldiers fighting for their country. He had never <note type="footnote"> (1) Pausanias, x. 4; x. 35.

              truth than that of Justin. The Theban and Athenian civic force would hardly <lb/>

              Sacred war,) we may set down at 2,000: the Corinthians and Phocians at about the <lb/>
              same. The mercenaries who returned to their standards, and possibly some con­ <lb/>
              tingents from other states, may be reckoned at 4,000 or 5,000. In number of cavalry <lb/>

              engaged in a fair pitched battle with the heavy-armed infantry of <lb/>
              Athens, Thebes, or Sparta, the leading republics of Greece. The <lb/>
              present confederacy was the most formidable which had yet been <lb/>
              arrayed against him; nor could he have been entirely free from mis­ <lb/>
              givings as to the result. We cannot doubt therefore, that, in order <lb/>
              to decide so important a contest, Philip took every precaution which <lb/>
              became a prudent commander ; and that he had collected around him <lb/>
              not only a force powerful in point of numbers, but the flower of the <lb/>
              Macedonian army, and especially the celebrated phalanx, which he <lb/>
              had brought to perfection by his own training and discipline.1 Of­ <lb/>
              this it may here be proper to give a brief description.</p>
          <p>The Macedonian phalanx, as organised by Philip, was an improve­ <lb/>
            meat on the order of battle already in use among the Greeks. 2 The <lb/>
            long line of heavy-armed infantry, standing with spear and shield in <lb/>
            close array, was called a phalanx.3 In this way most of the Greek <lb/>
            republican armies were drawn up for battle, the depth of the line <lb/>
            varying according to circumstances. At Mantinea, in the Pelopon­ <lb/>
            nesian war, the Lacedæmonians were drawn up in a line of four <lb/>
            hundred and forty-eight men, eight deep.4 At Leuctra the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians stood twelve deep, the Thebans fifty deep.5 The soldiers <lb/>
            held their spears couched in two hands, the left arm being passed <lb/>
            through the ring of the shield, which was also suspended by a thong <lb/>
            from the neck, and covered the whole body down to the knee.' In <lb/>
            this order they made their charge, generally at a running pace, en­ <lb/>
            deavouring to bear down the enemy by the force and pressure of their <lb/>
            spears. Troops unprovided with good defensive armour were unable <lb/>
            to withstand the shock of the heavy-armed Greeks. Thus the <lb/>
            Athenians at Marathon, and the Spartans at Platæa proved them­ <lb/>
            selves superior to the numerous hosts of Darius and Xerxes: after <lb/>
            which the Persian infantry never dared to face the Greek in a fair <lb/>
            field of battle.</p>
          <p>Philip, having in his younger days seen and admired the well-trained <lb/>
            battalions of Thebes, determined to introduce a similar discipline into <note type="footnote"> (1) Mitford in his History of Greece, vol. iv. c. 42, a. 4, contends that Philip's was <lb/>
            a miscellaneous Amphictyonic army, with a small proportion of Macedonians, and <lb/>
            probably without the phalanx. In support of his opinion he cites Demosthenes, <lb/>

              the Macedonian army. He formed his phalanx upon the general <lb/>
              model of the Greek, making some alterations which he thought <lb/>
              would increase its efficiency. He adopted the shield and other de­ <lb/>
              fensive armour of the Greek infantry, but lengthened the spear and <lb/>
              the sword, as Iphicrates had done for his Peltastæ. The Macedonian <lb/>
              spear, called sarissa, was at first sixteen cubits or twenty-four feet <lb/>
              long, though afterwards reduced to twenty-one feet. 1 The tactical <lb/>
              arrangements, which Arrian and other writers describe as in use <lb/>
              under Alexander or his successors, were substantially the same as <lb/>
              those adopted by Philip. The whole phalanx, containing from six­ <lb/>
              teen to eighteen thousand men, was divided into battalions, each of <lb/>
              which was drawn up sixteen deep.2 The file was halved or doubled, <lb/>
              if occasion required; but sixteen was the ordinary depth. When <lb/>
              the phalanx advanced to the attack, there was a distance of three <lb/>
              feet between the soldiers both in rank and file; the first five ranks <lb/>
              couched their sarissas,3 so that those of the first rank projected fifteen <lb/>
              feet in front, those of the second rank twelve feet, those of the third <lb/>
              nine, those of the fourth six, and those of the fifth three. Thus the <lb/>
              soldiers in the first rank were guarded by five spears projecting on each <lb/>
              side. The sixth and hinder ranks held their spears uplifted, resting on <lb/>
              the shoulders of those before, and protecting them in some measure <lb/>
              from the arrows and missiles that flew over their heads. The pres­ <lb/>
              sure from behind added to the force of the whole battalion, by ren­ <lb/>
              dering it impossible for the front ranks to retreat.4</p>
          <p>Such was the phalanx, whose very aspect, two centuries after its <lb/>
            first formation, struck Paulus Æmilius with dismay.5 Encountered <lb/>
            front to front, and upon ground favourable to its operations, it was, <lb/>
            as Polybius affirms, irresistible.6 Its defects were, that it was un­ <lb/>
            wieldy and slow in its movements, and not adapted to varieties of <lb/>
            place and occasion. The perfect order and regularity, which were <lb/>
            required for its efficient action, could not well be maintained except <lb/>
            upon level ground, free from impediments, such as trees, bushes, <lb/>
            ditches, streams, and the like. A plain perfectly suitable for the <lb/>
            movements of so large a body could not always be found. Again, it <note type="footnote"> (1) Polybius, xviii. 12. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κατὰ μέν τὴν ὲξ ὰρχη̃ς ὐπόθεσιν έκκαίδεκα πηχω̃ν, κατὰ δὲ <lb/>

            could not act with advantage, if vigorously assailed in the flank and <lb/>
            rear. The wheeling round to meet a flank attack was a difficult and <lb/>
            dangerous evolution in the presence of an active enemy :1 and if the <lb/>
            phalanx were threatened on both sides, and the rear had to face <lb/>
            about, every step which it made in advance had a tendency to open <lb/>
            the files and break the continuity of the mass. Once thrown into <lb/>
            disorder, the complex machine became utterly useless, and the indi­ <lb/>
            vidual soldier with his long weapon was ill fitted for a hand-to-hand <lb/>
            combat. All these defects fully appeared in the wars with the <lb/>
            Romans; especially at Pydna, where the legionaries, attacking the <lb/>
            Macedonians on all sides at once, disordered their ranks, and break­ <lb/>
            ing in at the openings, slaughtered them almost without resistance.2 <lb/>
            The Greeks however, who fought the Macedonians in their own way, <lb/>
            ranks meeting and spears crossing in the accustomed fashion, allowed <lb/>
            them the full advantage of their improved organisation and discipline.</p>
          <p>While the phalanx constituted the main strength of Philip's army, <lb/>
            it was supported by other troops, which had often followed him to <lb/>
            victory. There were the foot guards,3 who had been long talked of in <lb/>
            Greece; from whom afterwards were taken the Hypaspists of Alex­ <lb/>
            ander, a body of men who wore the long shield of the phalanx, but <lb/>
            carried shorter spears and lighter armour. Of these there were about <lb/>
            six thousand. A select body of them, distinguished for their superior <note type="footnote"> (1) Polybius, xviii. 9. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τη̃ς</foreign> a <foreign xml:lang="grc">τω̃ν φαλαγγιτω̃ν χρείας ἀδυνάτου καθεστώσης ὲκ <lb/>

            Polybius has reference. See Arrian’s description of Alexander's arrangements before <lb/>
            the battle of Arbela: (Anab. iii. 12.) from which indeed it appears that the light <lb/>
            troops were called in aid, to protect the phalanx from attacks on the flank and rear. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) When the Italians attempted to close with the front ranks, and break their <lb/>
            pikes, they fared no better than the Persians did at Platæa. (Livy, xliv. 40, suppl. 3.) <lb/>
            " Illi prælongas Macedonumhastas aut ferro incidere, autumbone impellere, autnudis <lb/>

            etiam homines super capita projicerent." Æmilius however soon discovered the true <lb/>
            way of proceeding: (Ibid. suppl. 4.) " Animadvertit peritus dux non stare ubique <lb/>
            confertam illam hostium velut compagem, eamque dehiscere identidem quibusdam <lb/>

            (Ibid. 41.) " Neque ullaevidentior causa victoriæ fuit, quam quod multa passim prcelia <lb/>

            bravery, were called Argyraspids from the bright silver plates on <lb/>
            their shields.1 Light troops of various kind, slingers, archers, and <lb/>
            javelin-men, were furnished by the Thracians, Pæonians, Illyrians, <lb/>
            Agrianians,2 and other warlike tribes of the north, who were now an­ <lb/>
            nexed to the Macedonian empire. The Pæonians and Thracians <lb/>
            supplied squadrons of light-horse: the heavy cavalry came from <lb/>
            Macedonia and Thessaly.3 It is not unlikely that there were Ætolians <lb/>
            in Philip's army; as that people, afterwards the deadly enemies of <lb/>
            Macedonia, were now ranked among his allies.4</p>
          <p>The choicest of the troops opposed to him were the heavy-armed <lb/>
            of Thebes and Athens. Twenty years before the Thebans were con­ <lb/>
            sidered the best soldiers of Greece. The military exercises, to which <lb/>
            they partly owed their preeminence, were probably not discontinued; <lb/>
            yet, that their discipline and energy had greatly declined since the <lb/>
            battle of Mantinea, is shown by the events of the Sacred war. Among <lb/>
            the Athenian ranks there were plenty of brave men; the whole body <lb/>
            of them were animated with a good spirit: but they were deficient in <lb/>
            that training, which teaches soldiers to act in combination, and con­ <lb/>
            verts a multitude into an army. It had been the boast of Pericles, <lb/>
            that his countrymen fought well enough by their native valour, and <lb/>
            did not need to prepare themselves by laborious drilling.5 But De­ <lb/>
            lium and many other battles proved how unsafe it was to rely upon <lb/>
            such a principle. In the time of Pericles indeed the constant service <lb/>
            for which Athenian citizens were called out was of itself a species of <lb/>
            training. At this time they were little used to serving in person: <lb/>
            many of them had never seen the face of an enemy in the field, and <lb/>
            knew little of the art and practice of war beyond the use of their <lb/>
            arms, which they learned in early years. How could such men, a <lb/>
            mere national militia, be a match for the veterans of Philip, who had <lb/>
            not only been the victors in numerous battles, but even in time of <lb/>
            peace were exercised in toilsome marches, to keep them in perpetual <lb/>
            activity ? 6</p>
          <p>But if the soldiers of the allied army were not equal to those of <lb/>
            Philip, still less were their commanders to be compared with him. <lb/>

            man at all equal to the emergency. Phocion bad been absent in the <lb/>
            Ægæan when hostilities began: on his return to Athens he declared <lb/>
            himself favourable to peace; perhaps he expressed himself too <lb/>
            strongly against the war, and this prevented his obtaining an ap­ <lb/>
            pointment, for which of all his countrymen he was the best fitted.1 <lb/>
            The Athenians were now commanded by Lysicles, Chares, and Stra­ <lb/>
            tocles; the Thebans by Theagenes; none of them fit to be at the <lb/>
            head of an army. Demosthenes was with them, sanguine himself as <lb/>
            to the result, and advising them to seek the enemy in spite of dis­ <lb/>
            couraging omens and unpropitious sacrifices:2 but he could render no <lb/>
            service in the hour of battle.</p>
          <p>For a description of the battle itself we have but scanty materials. <lb/>
            The best history of it is to be found in the comparison of the two <lb/>
            armies. A few special incidents only are recorded. Athenians and <lb/>
            Thebans rushed upon the bristling forest of sarissas, and fought with <lb/>
            a valour worthy of ancient times and of a better fate. It is said that <lb/>
            Philip, knowing the Athenians to be impetuous in onset but incapable <lb/>
            of endurance, ordered his soldiers to keep on the defensive till the <lb/>
            strength of their adversaries was exhausted. At one point so furious <lb/>
            an attack was made by Stratocles, that the Macedonian line gave way; <lb/>
            Stratocles drove before him the retreating phalangites, crying—“ Let <lb/>
            us chase them to Macedon;" but pressing on too hastily, he threw <lb/>
            his own troops into disorder; when Philip directed a timely charge <lb/>
            which put them to the rout. On the other wing Alexander, supported <lb/>
            by the ablest of his father's generals, was opposed to the Thebans, <lb/>
            and was the first to charge the hitherto invincible Sacred band. <lb/>
            The contest was bloody, and for a long time doubtful. Alexander <lb/>
            made extraordinary efforts to prove himself worthy of the post as­ <lb/>
            signed to him. The Thebans, after obstinately disputing every inch <lb/>
            of ground, yielded at last to the superior strength of their opponents <lb/>
            As soon as they had given way, Philip, determined not to be outdone <lb/>
            by his son, led his phalanx in person against the Athenian line, and de­ <lb/>
            cided the victory. A fearful slaughter was made of the allied army, now <lb/>
            broken on all sides. Of the total loss of the Thebans we have no <lb/>
            account. Their general Theagenes was slain;3 and the three hundred <lb/>
            of the Sacred band fell side by side, perishing to a man. Of the <lb/>
            Athenians there fell more than a thousand, and two thousand were <note type="footnote"> (1) Plutarch, Vit. Phocion, 16. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) Æschines reproaches him for this; and also for his sneering at the Delphian <lb/>

              taken prisoners. Demosthenes, who had fought in the ranks, <lb/>
              escaped with the fugitives to Athens. In one short day all his lofty <lb/>

              of his country and the independence of Greece had been rendered <lb/>

          <p>The news of this dreadful calamity was speedily. brought to Athens. <lb/>
            It is said to have killed Isocrates, who at the age of ninety-eight was <lb/>
            in the full possession of his health and faculties, but now abstained <lb/>
            from food, heart-broken at the sad tidings of his country's defeat.' <lb/>
            The general grief and terror may well be imagined: but they are <lb/>
            described to us by an eye-witness.4 It was uncertain for the moment, <lb/>
            how many of the citizens had been slain or captured. Almost all <lb/>
            capable of bearing arms, between the ages of twenty and fifty, had <lb/>
            been sent out: and the hopes of defending Athens seemed to rest <lb/>
            upon those who were past the age of active service. Women were <lb/>
            seen standing at their doors in an agony of distress, asking every one <lb/>
            that passed if their husbands, fathers, sons, or brothers were alive. <lb/>
            Old and infirm men were walking about the streets with their mantles <lb/>
            doubled up, as if girding themselves to perform the duties of the <lb/>
            young. As the fugitives successively flocked in, the real extent of <lb/>
            the disaster was ascertained, and the people, rallying from their first <lb/>
            dismay, hastened to meet as became them the distressing exigency of <lb/>
            the hour. It was no longer possible to act in cooperation with the <lb/>
            Thebans; each of the allied cities was thrown entirely upon its own <lb/>
            resources: and it was uncertain against which of them the conqueror <lb/>
            would first advance. It was necessary to put Athens in a condition <lb/>
            to sustain a siege, and that without any delay. Resolutions for that <note type="footnote"> (1) Diodorus, xvi. 86. Pausanias, ix. 40. Plutarch, Vit. Alexand. 7; Vit. <lb/>

            (See Dinarchus, Contr. Demosth. 91. Æschines, Contr. Ctesiph. 74, 76, 89.) But, as <lb/>

              purpose, framed chiefly by Hyperides and Demosthenes, were imme­ <lb/>
              diately passed in full assembly, ordering (among other things) that <lb/>
              the women and children should be brought in from the country; that <lb/>
              the generals should be empowered to require for garrison dutythe ser­ <lb/>
              vices of all residents in Athens, whether citizens or foreigners; that <lb/>
              the members of the council should go down in arms to the Piræus, <lb/>
              and execute what measures they thought best for its security; that <lb/>
              slaves bearing arms for the commonwealth should be emancipated, <lb/>
              aliens be made citizens, and the disfranchised restored to their rights. <lb/>
              Energetic measures were taken for the restoring and strengthening <lb/>
              the fortifications. Men of every age lent a helping hand for the na­ <lb/>
              tional defence. The country (says Lycurgus) contributed her trees, <lb/>
              the dead their sepulchres, the temples their arms. Patriotic citizens <lb/>
              came forward with large donations of money for the public service, <lb/>
              Demosthenes himself contributing liberally towards the repair of the <lb/>
              walls, which he had been appointed to superintend. It was further <lb/>
              deemed expedient to solicit aid from some of the nearest friendly <lb/>
              states. Embassies were sent to Trcezen and Epidaurus: and subsidies <lb/>
              were collected from some of the nearest islands. Demosthenes, who <lb/>
              was sent on one of these expeditions, is reproached for it by AEschines <lb/>
              and Dinarchus, as if he had deserted his country for fear of the <lb/>
              enemy. We learn from Dinarchus however, that Demosthenes was <lb/>
              by a decree of the people appointed envoy, and it appears that at this <lb/>
              time, notwithstanding the unfortunate issue of his counsels, he con­ <lb/>
              tinued to enjoy the confidence of the Athenians; for not only did they <lb/>
              pass divers decrees which he had moved for the public safety, but <lb/>
              they appointed him to hold the office of a commissioner of grain, and <lb/>
              afterwards conferred upon him a still higher proof of their esteem, by <lb/>
              selecting him to speak the funeral oration in honour of their fellow- <lb/>
              citizens who had fallen in battle. Further, when his adversaries, <lb/>
              thinking their position strengthened by the peace, assailed Demo­ <lb/>
              sthenes with indictments and other legal proceedings, he obtained a <lb/>
              triumphant acquittal upon all.</p>
          <p>To the general zeal displayed by the citizens of Athens a few dis­ <lb/>
            graceful exceptions are recorded. There were men who left or <lb/>
            attempted to leave the city, in order to secure themselves and their <lb/>
            families: and the example was considered so dangerous, that a special <lb/>
            decree was passed, making it treasonable to desert the country in <lb/>
            such a way. One man who had embarked for Samos was appre­ <lb/>
            hended by the Council of Areopagus, and on the same day sentenced <lb/>
            to death. Autolycus, an Areopagite, was condemned for having sent <lb/>
            away his wife and children, though he himself remained in Athens. <lb/>
            But the most remarkable case is that of Leocrates; who, as soon as <lb/>
            he had heard that the battle was lost, sailed away clandestinely with <note type="footnote"> (1) Lycurgus, Contr. Leocrat. 149,153. Dinarchus, Contr. Demosth. 100. Æschines, <lb/>

            all his family and moveable effects to Rhodes, where he reported that <lb/>
            Athens was taken, that Piræus was besieged, and he was the only <lb/>
            person who had escaped. The Rhodians, believing his story, sent out <lb/>
            cruisers to commit piracy in the Ægæan; and the merchants in the <lb/>
            harbour unshipped the corn and other goods which they were about <lb/>
            to export to Athens. When the real truth became known, Leocrates <lb/>
            quitted Rhodes, and came to live at Megara, contriving by means of <lb/>
            his friends to sell what property he had left at Athens. After the <lb/>
            lapse of seven years he returned to his country, and was impeached <lb/>
            by Lycurgus in the manner already mentioned.</p>
          <p>While we admire the spirit with which the people of Athens bore <lb/>
            up against their misfortunes, and the generous support which they <lb/>
            gave to Demosthenes in the hour of his humiliation, one is sorry <lb/>
            to find an act of the Athenian public recorded, which it is impossible <lb/>
            to view with the same approving eye. Lysicles, who had commanded <lb/>
            the army at Chæronea, was on the accusation of Lycurgus brought to <lb/>
            trial, condemned, and executed, apparently for no other reason than <lb/>
            because he had lost the battle. Mitford conceives it to have been a <lb/>
            bold stroke of the war party, who, knowing that popular vengeance <lb/>
            would demand a victim, resolved to sacrifice Lysicles to secure their <lb/>
            own safety.2 Thirlwall seems to think, that the character of Lycurgus <lb/>
            the prosecutor affords some proof of the justness of the sentence.3 <lb/>
            The extract from his speech, preserved to us by Diodorus, exhibits <lb/>
            the Spartan-like severity of the speaker's character, but indicates no <lb/>
            special ground of cowardice or misconduct, distinguishing the case of <lb/>
            Lysicles from that of his colleagues or any other unfortunate generals. <lb/>
            His words are these:4—“You, Lysicles, were the commander: a <lb/>
            thousand citizens have fallen; two thousand have been made captive; <lb/>
            a trophy has been raised against Athens; and the whole of Greece is <lb/>
            in servitude. When all this has taken place under your conduct and <lb/>
            command, dare you to live, and to behold the light of the sun, and <lb/>
            to make your appearance in the market-place: you that are a monu­ <lb/>
            ment of shame and disgrace to your country P "</p>
          <p>Whether the Athenians with all their preparations could have <lb/>
            successfully defended themselves against Philip's army, had he ad­ <lb/>
            vanced to besiege Athens, was not put to the trial Philip adopted <lb/>
            such prudent and conciliatory measures, that they were tempted to <lb/>
            abandon the high ground of resistance to Macedonian power, and to <lb/>
            accept terms of peace which he prescribed. It is said that in the first <lb/>
            moment of victory Philip gave way to feelings of indecent triumph, <lb/>
            and insulted over his fallen enemies. Having drunk to excess at the <lb/>
            banquet, he walked over the field of battle, and sang in iambic verse <lb/>
            the prefatory words of Demosthenes' decree, stamping with his feet <note type="footnote"> (1) Lycurgus, Contr. Leocrat. 149, 150. Æschines, Contr. Ctesiph. 39. Ante, <lb/>

            and dancing to the cadence.1 Visiting the Athenian prisoners, he <lb/>
            derided their misfortunes, and was rebuked by Demades in the manner <lb/>
            already related.2 These were but the intemperate sallies of the moment. <lb/>
            It is said however, that he at first refused the Athenians the customary <lb/>
            permission to bury their dead, which they had sent a herald to <lb/>
            demand. His object in so doing perhaps was, to prevent their open­ <lb/>
            ing any communication with the Thebans: and he may for prudential <lb/>
            reasons have assumed an appearance of rigour, which he never meant <lb/>
            really to exercise. Certain it is, he very quickly decided upon adopt­ <lb/>
            ing lenient measures towards the Athenians. He entered into conn­ <lb/>
            dential discourse with Demades, who must have been already known <lb/>
            to him as an opponent of Demosthenes and the war party at Athens; <lb/>
            and whom he found to be a man of agreeable manners, and likely to <lb/>
            be a useful instrument to serve his present purposes. The orator <lb/>
            doubtless exerted his powers of persuasion to recommend a mild and <lb/>
            pacific policy: and a careful reflection upon his position and prospects <lb/>
            convinced Philip, that it was wiser to conciliate the Athenians than <lb/>
            to drive them to desperation.3 He therefore intimated his willing­ <lb/>
            ness to restore the Athenian prisoners without ransom: he burned <lb/>
            the bodies of the slain, and sent a deputation carrying their bones to <lb/>
            Athens. It was headed by his son Alexander and Antipater, who <lb/>
            communicated the terms upon which he was willing to treat for <lb/>
            peace. These, though not honourable, were much better than the <lb/>
            Athenians had expected, and they were favourably received by the <lb/>
            people: the war party could not venture under existing circumstances <note type="footnote"> (1) Plutarch, Vit. Demosth. 20-</note> <figure type="illustration">

              before this engaged in the cause of Philip, would not have ventured to use such <lb/>
              freedom with him. Demades however was a strange compound. It is certain that <lb/>
              he was a man of consummate assurance; and it is not at all unlikely that he may have <lb/>
              taken this way of introducing himself to Philip. The positive testimony of Diodorus <lb/>
              is not lightly to be rejected; for, with all his faults of omission and negligence, he is <lb/>
              too honest to record anything destitute of authority. The accounts of Philip's con­ <lb/>
              duct given by Diodorus and Plutarch are seemingly indeed at variance with those of <lb/>
              other writers. Justin says, (ix. 4)—“Hujus Victoriæ callide dissimulata lætitia est. <lb/>
              Denique non solita sacra Philippus illâ die fecit: non in convivio risit: non ludos <lb/>

              ita vicit ut victorem nemo sentiret." Compare Ælian, Var. Hist. viii. 15. The dif­ <lb/>
              ferent statements are perhaps not irreconcilable. Philip assumed a grave and <lb/>
              severe deportment; but it gave way on one or two occasions to a fit of intemperance. <lb/>
              What is more likely? </note><note type="footnote"> (3) Philip's title to the praise, which Polybius bestows upon him for his lenity to <lb/>

              tility of Athens; that it was by no means certain that he could have made himself <lb/>
              master of the city and Piraeus ; the danger of a failure, and even the inconvenience <lb/>
              of delay, was greater than the advantage to be reaped from it; be had more brilliant <lb/>
              objects in view: time was precious to him, and it would have been wantonly to <lb/>

              for this very purpose, framed a treaty of peace, which he carried in <lb/>
              the assembly without any opposition: by the terms of which the <lb/>
              Athenians renounced all their pretensions to naval sovereignty, and all <lb/>
              their dominions in the Ægæan sea, except Lemnos, Imbrus, and, <lb/>
              Samos. Virtually, though not in words, they acknowledged Philip as; <lb/>
              the head of the Hellenic community. In exchange for these conces­ <lb/>
              sions, they obtained peace and present security, and a return of their <lb/>
              prisoners; likewise the city of Oropus, which was transferred to <lb/>
              them from the Thebans, but to recover which in such a way was <lb/>
              more of a disgrace than an advantage. Votes of honour to Philip <lb/>
              were passed in the assembly on the motion of Demades; who now, <lb/>
              together with the other members of his party, began to regain credit <lb/>
              and influence in Athens. AEschines boasted that he was on terms <lb/>
              of friendship with the king of Macedon, and went on an embassy <lb/>
              to his camp. Submission and subserviency were the order of the <lb/>
              day.1</p>
          <p>While Philip was carrying on peaceful negotiation with Athens, he <lb/>
            was taking measures of a very different character against the Thebans. <lb/>
            Towards them his conduct was as harsh as it was lenient to their <lb/>
            allies. He not only exacted ransom for their prisoners, but made <lb/>
            them pay a price for the burial of their dead. Yet this was nothing <lb/>
            in comparison with what followed. Very shortly after the battle, he <lb/>
            contrived to make himself master of Thebes itself. Whether he took <lb/>
            it by surprise, or whether it was surrendered to him by the philip­ <lb/>
            pising party or otherwise, we are not informed. There are no Theban <lb/>
            writers to give us any historical particulars about their countrymen. <lb/>
            It may be presumed that Philip lost no time in following up his <lb/>
            victory; and the severe loss which the Thebans had sustained at <lb/>
            Chæronea must have materially impaired both'their courage and their <lb/>
            means for defence. Philip, having got possession of the city, treated <lb/>
            it as the Spartans had done forty-four years before, subjecting it to <lb/>
            all the rigours of military occupation. A Macedonian garrison was <lb/>
            placed in the Cadmea. As a further check upon insurrection, Orcho­ <lb/>
            menus and Platæa were reestablished, and filled with a population <lb/>
            hostile to Thebes. All the Bœotian towns were declared independent. <lb/>
            Some of the principal Theban statesmen were put to death by Philip's <lb/>
            order; others were banished; their property was seized for his use. <lb/>
            He recalled a large number of exiles, three hundred of whom he <lb/>
            formed into a council, invested with summary powers, both executive <lb/>
            and judicial One of their first acts was, to bring their political <lb/>
            enemies to trial for having sentenced them to exile. The accused <lb/>
            gloried in their crime, and courted the vengeance that was prepared <lb/>
            for them. This was but a foretaste of what the unhappy Thebans <note type="footnote"> (1) Diodorus, xvL 87; xviii. 56. Demades, Fragment. 179. Demosthenes, Do <lb/>

            <title type="sub">WHETHER CTESIPHON BROKE THE LAW.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THE two special grounds upon which Machines contended that <lb/>
            Ctesiphon had violated the law, were,</p>
          <p>First, because he had proposed to crown Demosthenes, before he <lb/>
            had rendered an account of his official administration, Demosthenes <lb/>
            having been a conservator of walls, and a treasurer of the Theoric <lb/>
            fund:</p>
          <p>Secondly, because he had proposed to publish the coronation in <lb/>
            the theatre at the Dionysian festival, at the performance of the new <lb/>
            tragedies.</p>
          <p>In support of the first proposition, Æschines2 cites a law which <lb/>
            expressly forbade the bestowing of a crown upon any magistrate or <lb/>
            official personage who had still his account to render. Anticipating <lb/>
            an objection, that the offices held by Demosthenes were not magis­ <lb/>
            tracies, such as the law applied to, but rather inferior agencies or <lb/>
            employments,3 he shows that by the law of Athens all offices to which <lb/>
            the people elected were to be deemed of a magisterial character, and <lb/>
            that all superintendents of public works, and all persons who were <lb/>
            entrusted with any of the public money for more than thirty days, <lb/>
            or who held a legal jurisdiction, were to be considered as holding <lb/>
            such offices, and were subject to the usual scrutiny4 before they <lb/>
            entered upon their duties. A conservator of walls was clearly a <lb/>
            superintendent of public works; and he also presided in a court of <lb/>
            judicature. Demosthenes had been appointed to that office by the <lb/>
            Pandionian tribe in pursuance of a decree of the people, and had had <lb/>
            the disbursement of ten talents of the public money. He had been <lb/>
            elected treasurer of the Theoric fund by the people in general assem­ <lb/>
            bly. It made no difference, whether or not he had expended any of <lb/>
            his own money gratuitously. He was liable to render an account in <lb/>
            one or both of the aforesaid characters, even though none of the <note type="footnote"> (1) Diodorus, xvi. 37 ; xvii. 8, 9, &amp;c. Justin, ix. 4. Dinarchus, Contr. Demosth. <lb/>

            public monies had passed through his hands. It was a principle of <lb/>
            the democracy, that no magisterial functionary should be irresponsible.</p>
          <p>He then proceeds to the second point,1 and produces a law, enacting <lb/>
            that, if the council bestowed a crown upon any citizen, it should be <lb/>
            proclaimed in the council-chamber, if the people, in the assembly, but <lb/>
            not in any other place; the object of which law he declares to have <lb/>
            been, that honours of this kind, which concerned the commonwealth <lb/>
            and its members only, should not be ostentatiously displayed before <lb/>
            foreigners. Ctesiphon had infringed this statute, for the purpose of <lb/>
            making an idle parade of his friend's honours at the Dionysian festival, <lb/>
            when a large number of the Greeks were present.</p>
          <p>Upon this part of the case he anticipates the answer which we <lb/>
            find to have been actually made—viz. that there was a Jaw which <lb/>
            permitted crowns to be proclaimed in the theatre, if the people <lb/>
            authorized it by their decree. That law, says Æschines, is not incon­ <lb/>
            sistent with the one upon which I rely: nor indeed can there be two <lb/>
            inconsistent laws: but it relates to an entirely different matter. A <lb/>
            bad practice had sprung up; that men, who possessed influence in <lb/>
            foreign states, got crowns presented to them by those states, and <lb/>
            then had them proclaimed in the theatre at home. To put a stop to <lb/>
            such an objectionable custom, a statute was passed, making it un­ <lb/>
            lawful for crowns given by foreign states to be proclaimed in the <lb/>
            theatre, except under a special resolution of the Athenian people. <lb/>
            The law which Ctesiphon violated, which defined the places where <lb/>
            crowns were to be proclaimed, applied to those which were given at <lb/>
            home.</p>
          <p>To these arguments Demosthenes makes but a short reply.2 He <lb/>
            does not at all dispute his general accountability in respect of the <lb/>
            offices which he had held. He denies however that he was account­ <lb/>
            able to the state for what he had expended out of his private purse; <lb/>
            and he contends that the crown was bestowed upon him, not for the <lb/>
            acts of which he had an account to render, but for his gifts, which <lb/>
            were not the subject of account. With respect to the place of pro­ <lb/>
            clamation, he adduces a law (as Æschines had expected) seemingly <lb/>
            at variance with that on which the prosecution was founded, and not <lb/>
            admitting the construction which Æschines had put upon it. He cen­ <lb/>
            sures AEschines for misrepresenting the object of the lawgiver in fixing <lb/>
            the place of proclamation, and not seeing that the proclamation was <lb/>
            for the benefit of those who conferred, not those who received the <lb/>
            honour. He refers also to a variety of cases, in which decrees similar <lb/>
            to that of Ctesiphon, and under similar circumstances, had been passed <lb/>
            in favour of other men.</p>
          <p>With regard to the contradictory laws, we have not sufficient data <lb/>
            to form an opinion. Each of the orators accuses the other of garbling <lb/>
            he law which he cites: and we have not the whole of the statutes <note type="footnote"> Æschines, Contr. Ctesiuh. 58—60.</note> <note type="footnote">(2) See ante, pp. 46—61. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="399"/>
            before us, to enable us to see which is right. But the defence which <lb/>
            Demosthenes sets up as to the time of crowning we have little diffi­ <lb/>
            culty in pronouncing to be sophistical. The Jaw which enacted, that <lb/>
            no public functionary who had not passed his audit should be crowned, <lb/>
            meant that the honour should not be conferred either for official ser­ <lb/>
            vices or on any other account. Besides, the crown given by Ctesiphon <lb/>
            to Demosthenes actually purported to be a requital of his official <lb/>
            services: for those donations to the public, which were specially <lb/>
            commended, related to the business of his administration. In any <lb/>
            point of view therefore Ctesiphon had by his decree violated the <lb/>
            letterof the Athenian law: but it is clear also, that he violated the <lb/>
            spirit of it. For a magistrate might be very liberal in donations to <lb/>
            the public, and yet might in some way or other grossly abuse his <lb/>
            trust: he might be generous with the one hand, and squander the <lb/>
            public money with the other. At his official audit the whole of his <lb/>
            administration would be inquired into: and he would be liable to <lb/>
            punishment, if in any particular he had seriously neglected his duty. <lb/>
            Butby commending him for one part of his conduct, while the other <lb/>
            was kept out of view, the merits of the case were unfairly prejudged <lb/>
            before it came to the auditors. And this is the very abuse of which <lb/>
            AEschines complains: crafty orators got premature votes of honours <lb/>
            for their friends, to screen them from charges for official misconduct.1</p>
          <p>The precedents cited by Demosthenes prove no more than what <lb/>
            Æschines admitted; that the law had often been broken before; not <lb/>
            that it ought to be broken, or was not still in force. If any weight <lb/>
            were attached to them, it concerned the penalty rather than the <lb/>
            verdict of guilty or not guilty.</p>
          <p>Had Æschines confined himself to these two questions upon the <lb/>
            laws, it appears undeniable, that the verdict ought to have been in <lb/>
            his favour. But this did not satisfy him. He wished to cast re­ <lb/>
            proach upon the character and politics of Demosthenes; and therefore <lb/>
            heintroduced the third charge, which raised the issue, whether <lb/>
            Demosthenes had deserved well of his country. By mixing the three <lb/>
            issues together, he thought to ensure success in the cause; and he <lb/>
            expected that a verdict against Ctesiphon, on whatever ground ob­ <lb/>
            tained, would be a triumph over Demosthenes, and would have the <lb/>
            effect of disgracing him and his party in the eyes of all the Greeks. <lb/>
            Hereupon arises a question-whether Æschines should have been <note type="footnote"> (1) Æschines, Contr. Ctesiph. 55. <foreign xml:lang="grc">᾽Ε</foreign>v <foreign xml:lang="grc">γὰρ</foreign> Tort <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔμπροσθεν χρόνοις ἄρχοντές τινες</foreign> </note> <figure type="illustration">

              allowed to succeed in his manoeuvre, and obtain such an indirect <lb/>
              triumph over his rival. Not that Demosthenes ever raised such <lb/>
              a point for the consideration of his judges-he was too old an orator <lb/>
              to admit that any part of his case was weak. It is a point however <lb/>
              which the Athenians who decided the cause ought to have considered, <lb/>
              and perhaps did consider-a question of ethical jurisprudence, upon <lb/>
              which the merits of their decision very much depend. The reader will <lb/>
              be better able to form his opinion upon this and other parts of the <lb/>
              subject, after seeing in what light they are presented by the always <lb/>
              just and clear-sighted Thirlwall</p>
          <p>“ Æschines had indicted Ctesiphon as having broken the law in <lb/>
            three points: first, because it was illegal to crown a magistrate before <lb/>
            he had rendered an account of his office: next, because it was for­ <lb/>
            bidden to proclaim such an honour, when bestowed by the people, in <lb/>
            any other place than the assembly-ground in the Pnyx, but particu­ <lb/>
            larly to proclaim it, as Ctesiphon had proposed: and lastly, because <lb/>
            the reason assigned in the decree, so far as related to the public con­ <lb/>
            duct of Demosthenes, was false, inasmuch as he had not deserved <lb/>
            any reward. Among these points there was one, on which it seems <lb/>
            clear that the charge of illegality was well grounded. Though the <lb/>
            superintendence of the repairs was probably not a magistracy in the <lb/>
            eye of the law, which indeed forbade any one to hold two at once, the <lb/>
            treasurership of the Theoric fund certainly was one, and one to which <lb/>
            the law, which forbade the crowning of a magistrate still accountable, <lb/>
            applied with peculiar force. As to the mode of the proclamation, it <lb/>
            seems doubtful, whether the law on which the prosecution rested <lb/>
            had not been modified by another, which declared that proclamation <lb/>
            might be made, as Ctesiphon proposed, if the people should so decree; <lb/>
            though AEschines speciously contended, that this exception was only <lb/>
            meant to relate to crowns bestowed on citizens, not by the people, <lb/>
            but by foreign states. But the third point, the truth or falsehood of <lb/>
            the reason alleged in the decree, was that on which, according to the <lb/>
            manifest sense of both the parties, of the court, and of all present <lb/>
            at the trial, the case really turned. The question at issue was in <lb/>
            substance, whether Demosthenes had been a good or a bad citizen. <lb/>
            It was on this account that the court was thronged by an extraordi­ <lb/>
            nary conflux of spectators, both citizens and strangers. Hence the <lb/>
            prosecutor, after a short discussion of the dry legal arguments, enters, <lb/>
            as on his main subject, into a full review of the public and private <lb/>
            life of Demosthenes: and Demosthenes, whose interest it was to <lb/>
            divert attention from the points of law, which were not his strong <lb/>
            ground, can scarcely find room for them in his defence of his own <lb/>
            policy and proceedings, which, with bitter attacks on his adversary, <lb/>
            occupies almost the whole of his speech.</p>
          <p>" The spirit displayed by the tribunal, which decided in favour of <note type="footnote"> (1) History of Greece, vol. vii. 135. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="401"/>
            Demosthenes on such grounds as he alleged, is at least as noble as <lb/>
            that of the Roman senate and people, when they went out to meet <lb/>
            and thank the Consul on his return from Cannæ. But the case may <lb/>
            seem to exhibit the Athenian administration of justice in a much less <lb/>
            favourable light. On one point at least it is clear that Ctesiphon's <lb/>
            decree was contrary to law. The attempt made by Demosthenes to <lb/>
            prove that the law, which forbade an accountable magistrate to be <lb/>
            crowned, did not apply to his case, only shows the extreme looseness <lb/>
            of legal reasoning which was tolerated in Athenian courts. It seems <lb/>
            indeed to have been admitted, that there had been numerous prece­ <lb/>
            dents for whatever was illegal in the decree as to the circumstances <lb/>
            of time and place. But this only proves the laxity which prevailed <lb/>
            in the observance of the laws. It appears that, according to that <lb/>
            theory of the constitution, which had been universally approved and <lb/>
            acted on in the purest times, immediately after the expulsion of the <lb/>
            thirty tyrants, the court which tried the author of a decree denounced <lb/>
            as illegal was bound to compare it with the letter of the law, and to <lb/>
            give judgment on the simple question of their strict agreement. But <lb/>
            it is evident that the courts had afterwards assumed greater freedom; <lb/>
            and it is not at all certain that this was repugnant, either to the <lb/>
            spirit of the constitution, or to the practice of preceding ages, with <lb/>
            the single exception of the short period in which the restoration of <lb/>
            the democracy awakened extraordinary jealousy for the maintenance <lb/>
            of the laws. The will of the people, declared in a decree, had been <lb/>
            subjected to the revision of a tribunal which might be expected to <lb/>
            possess superior means of information, to secure the people itself <lb/>
            against the pernicious consequences of temporary measures into <lb/>
            which it might be surprised. This seems to have been the general <lb/>
            object, to which all others were subordinate; and for this purpose it <lb/>
            might be necessary that in such cases the courts should be invested <lb/>
            with an ample discretion, and should not be required to adhere to the <lb/>
            letter of the laws, so as themselves to commit wrong, or to injure <lb/>
            the commonwealth. The form of the proceedings was such, that a <lb/>
            verdict against Ctesiphon must have been interpreted as' a condemna­ <lb/>
            tion of Demosthenes : and it was the deliberate will, and the highest <lb/>
            interest of the people, to show that it still honoured the man who <lb/>
            had not despaired of the commonwealth. It would have been better <lb/>
            that the prosecutor should not have been able so to embroil the <lb/>
            question: but where he did so, it was desirable that the court should <lb/>
