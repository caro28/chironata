          </ab>
          <p>LEPTINES in the year B.C. 356 passed a statute, enacting that no person <lb/>
            in Athens, whether citizen, denizen, or alien, should enjoy exemption <lb/>
            from the ordinary public burdens, saving only the descendants of <lb/>
            Harmodius and Aristogiton; and that it should not be lawful for the <lb/>
            people in future to grant any such exemption; and that whoever <lb/>
            petitioned for it should be liable to disfranchisement and other <lb/>
            severe penalties. Such was the substance of the statute, fragments <lb/>
            of which are found in different parts of the speech of Demosthenes.</p>
          <p>The public burdens to which the law of Leptines principally related <lb/>
            are the offices, which men of competent fortunes at Athens were <lb/>
            liable to serve, of Choragus, Gymnasiarch, and Feaster of the tribe : <lb/>
            of which a brief account is given in an appendix. Exemption from <lb/>
            these burdens was sometimes granted by popular decree to men who <lb/>
            had deserved well of the state; and not unfrequently it was extended <lb/>
            to their children. About the time that Leptines introduced his law <lb/>
            it seems to have been thought, that the people had granted this dis­ <lb/>
            tinction too inconsiderately and too often, and that many unworthy <lb/>
            persons were in the enjoyment of it. The commonwealth was greatly <lb/>
            impoverished by the losses of the Social war, and difficulties occurred <lb/>
            in providing for the expenses of those festivals which contributed so <lb/>
            much to the instruction and amusement of the Athenian people. <lb/>
            Men whose means were not affluent considered themselves aggrieved, <lb/>
            if they were selected to bear these charges, and endeavoured to <lb/>
            shift them on their neighbours, while they looked with an evil eye <lb/>
            upon a fortunate few, who .possessed the privilege of immunity. <lb/>
            Leptines introduced his law principally as a measure of relief, that <lb/>
            the state might not be deprived of services which she had a right to <lb/>
            exact, and which the privileged persons were well able to perform. <lb/>
            He contended, that the burden of these services ought to fall equally <lb/>
            upon all; that persons who had obtained immunity without having <note type="footnote"> VOL. III. </note> <note type="footnote"> B </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="2"/>
            deserved it, or had afterwards proved themselves unworthy of it by <lb/>
            their life and conduct, ought to be deprived : and as the people were­ <lb/>
            so liable to make improvident grants through the influence of de­ <lb/>
            ceiving orators, it was better that they should divest themselves of <lb/>
            the power. That there was no necessity for retaining it, was proved <lb/>
            by the example of Lacedæmon and Thebes, and also by the practice <lb/>
            of their own ancestors, who never adopted this method of rewarding <lb/>
            distinguished citizens. There were other rewards for merit, such as <lb/>
            crowns, statues, and maintenance in the Prytaneum, which the pro­ <lb/>
            posed law would not affect: it took away only those which were of <lb/>
            little value for the honour they conferred, and the existence of which <lb/>
            was injurious to the state. Such were the arguments by which Lep­ <lb/>
            tines induced the people of Athens to accept his law. Before the <lb/>
            year had expired, an indictment was preferred against him by one <lb/>
            Bathippus. for the purpose of quashing the new law as unconstitu­ <lb/>
            tional and improper, and also of punishing him as the author of it. <lb/>
            Bathippus died before the indictment was brought to trial; and the <lb/>
            advocates who were associated with him dropped further proceedings. <lb/>
            After the expiration of the year, when by the law of Athens Leptines <lb/>
            himself was safe from all personal danger, though his statute was. <lb/>
            still liable to impeachment, (as explained in Vol. II. Appendix VII.) <lb/>
            Aphepsion, the son of Bathippus, and Ctesippus, the son of Chabrias, <lb/>
            undertook to procure its repeal by a jury. Ctesippus was personally <lb/>
            interested in the matter; for he had inherited from his father the­ <lb/>
            immunity which was abolished. These young men, not feeling <lb/>
            themselves equal to the task of pleading in court, engaged the assist­ <lb/>
            ance of Phormio and Demosthenes; a practice which was very common <lb/>
            at Athens. On the other hand four advocates, besides Leptines,. <lb/>
            were appointed by the state to defend the law. Aphepsion, as the <lb/>
            elder of the two prosecutors, being entitled to begin, Phormio opened <lb/>
            the case for him. Demosthenes followed on behalf of Ctesippus. A <lb/>
            sketch of his principal arguments is subjoined:</p>
          <p>It was not just, (he contends,) to deprive the people of their power to <lb/>
            bestow honours because they had sometimes granted them improvi­ <lb/>
            dently. On the same principle all their constitutional rights might <lb/>
            be taken away, because they were not always wisely exercised. They <lb/>
            should rather make regulations to prevent the people from being <lb/>
            deceived in future, and for punishing the authors of the deceit.</p>
          <p>It was better that a few unworthy persons should receive honours, than <lb/>
            that no honour atall should be conferred: for in the last case there <lb/>
            was no stimulus to patriotism.</p>
          <p>It would be disgraceful to violate the national faith by revoking their <lb/>
            own gifts. No pecuniary gain could recompense them for the dis­ <lb/>
            honour that would attend such an act. People should maintain the <lb/>
            same integrity in their public as in their private dealings. It had <lb/>
            been the practice of the Athenians in former times to prefer faith and <lb/>
            justice to every other consideration.</p>
          <p>The gifts of a democratical government had formerly been regarded as <lb/>
            more secure than those of despots and oligarchs. The law of Leptines <lb/>
            would deprive them of this distinction.</p>
          <p>The advantage that would accrue to the state by abolishing the <lb/>
             <pb n="3"/>
            immunities had been greatly overrated. The number of persons <lb/>
            enjoying them was very small. There was no exemption allowed <lb/>
            from the trierarchy or the property tax, which were the most im­ <lb/>
            portant of the public services. Those who were called upon to <lb/>
            serve as trierarchs were by the ancient law free from the ordinary <lb/>
            duties; so that the richest citizens would not be reached by the law <lb/>
            of Leptines. The public treasury would gain nothing at all by it; <lb/>
            for the money spent on the offices of Choragus, &amp;c. went merely to the <lb/>
            shows and amusements. The commonwealth would really benefit <lb/>
            by the savings of the few privileged parties; because they would <lb/>
            have larger means of contributing to the war-taxes, which provided <lb/>
            for the national safety.</p>
          <p>The general words of the law, which took away immunities of every <lb/>
            kind, and from all persons, whether citizens, denizens, or aliens, would <lb/>
            include many distinguished foreigners, who had exhibited their <lb/>
            friendship to Athens in signal acts of generosity, and had received <lb/>
            in return the grant of exemption from such imposts and payments <lb/>
            as they would otherwise have been liable to. Among other examples <lb/>
            he specially notices the case of Leucon, king of the Bosporus, from <lb/>
            whose country the Athenians then exported a large quantity of corn <lb/>
            duty-free, an advantage of which the new law would deprive them : <lb/>
            and Epicerdes, the Cyrenæan, who had made gifts of money to <lb/>
            Athens in the times of her greatest distress. Not only would it be <lb/>
            an act of base ingratitude, to requite such benefactors in the manner <lb/>
            proposed, but it would discourage all other people who might be <lb/>
            inclined to befriend them in the hour of need.</p>
          <p>However unworthy some persons who enjoyed the immunity might be, <lb/>
            it was too late to raise that question now. The time for such inquiry <lb/>
            was when the honour was conferred. To take it away-after it had <lb/>
            been given would Jook like envy and malice. Moreover, the state <lb/>
            was not to judge of merit on the same principles as a private indi­ <lb/>
            vidual. A public benefactor might deserve to be rewarded by his <lb/>
            country, though his private character was not free from reproach.</p>
          <p>Conon and Chabrias were noble examples of men who had deserved <lb/>
            well of their country, and whose children ought not to be deprived <lb/>
            of the rewards bestowed upon them for acknowledged services. The <lb/>
            orator recounts these services at some length. Conon had been <lb/>
            honoured by foreign states, who never thought of rescinding what <lb/>
            they had done in his favour. Would the Athenians be less grateful <lb/>
            to their own citizen than foreigners had been ? Chabrias had lost <lb/>
            his life in battle; and even the Chians, against whom he fought, <lb/>
            had not revoked the honours which they had voted to him in former <lb/>
            times. It would be peculiarly cruel to rob his son of a privilege <lb/>
            earned by the very valour which had made him an orphan.</p>
          <p>The parties impeaching the law had themselves introduced another, <lb/>
            which, while it avoided the injustice done by Leptines, would correct <lb/>
            all the abuses of which he complained; for it secured to well­ <lb/>
            deserving persons the enjoyment of their fairly-earned privileges, <lb/>
            but authorized legal proceedings to be taken by which the unde­ <lb/>
            serving would be deprived. They had adopted the constitutional <lb/>
            course, of impugning the adverse law and at the same time pro- <note type="footnote"> B2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="4"/>
            posing another in its place: Leptines had deviated from the consti­ <lb/>
            tutional practice, by passing an act at variance with another existing <lb/>
            one, which declared " that the gifts of the people should be valid." <lb/>
            There were some other legislative regulations which Leptines had <lb/>
            not complied with. The same verdict which repealed his law would <lb/>
            establish the one proposed in its stead: but, if there was any doubt <lb/>
            upon this point, they pledged themselves, if necessary, to get it <lb/>
            passed.</p>
          <p>With respect to the argument, that there were no such immunities at <lb/>
            Thebes or Lacedæmon, he shows, that the laws and customs of those <lb/>
            states and the temper and feelings of the people were so different <lb/>
            from the Athenian, that they formed no proper subject of com­ <lb/>
            parison. And as to the practice of their ancestors: if they did not <lb/>
            give immunities, they gave other rewards to eminent citizens. <lb/>
            Customs varied at different eras: but at all events their ancestors <lb/>
            did not take away what they had once granted.</p>
          <p>It was true that crowns, statues, and maintenance in the Prytaneum <lb/>
            were left untouched by Leptines; but the public faith would equally <lb/>
            be shaken, and the higher honours would be rendered insecure by <lb/>
            the abolition of the smaller. Besides, it was to the advantage of the <lb/>
            state, that there should be different classes of honours to reward <lb/>
            different degrees of merit. And it was a poor consolation to those <lb/>
            who lost what had been given them, that there was something better <lb/>
            left for others to enjoy.</p>
          <p>Leptines would endeavour to mislead the jury by classing the ordinary <lb/>
            official services among those of religion. They were not to be <lb/>
            confounded. Had the two classes of duties been the same, the <lb/>
            descendants of Harmodius and Aristogiton could not have been <lb/>
            excepted from the operation of the law: for their ancient grant of <lb/>
            immunity did not extend to religious services.</p>
          <p>It would be said also, that there were multitudes of foreigners claiming <lb/>
            immunities under false pretences. Demosthenes cautions his hearers <lb/>
            against being deceived by any vague assertions of this kind: after <lb/>
            which he returns to general topics, urging them to rescind a law <lb/>
            which could answer no good purpose, and was injurious to the <lb/>
            national character. He shows by reference to their laws and customs, <lb/>
            that the Athenians had always been distinguished for their love and <lb/>
            admiration of virtue, and also for justice, generosity, and magna­ <lb/>
            nimity. They should maintain that honourable reputation, and not <lb/>
            forfeit their title to it, in order that Leptines might wreak his <lb/>
            malice upon some private enemies. It might be better, he suggests, <lb/>
            even for Leptines himself to abandon his law, lest by abolishing the <lb/>
            rewards of merit he should make it appear that he had no desire to <lb/>
            be a benefactor of his country.</p>
          <p>He shows some special reasons for not listening to the advocates who <lb/>
            were associated with Leptines, and urges one objection which applied <lb/>
            to all of them, viz. that they had been appointed for a similar pur­ <lb/>
            pose before, and the Athenian law did not allow a man to act in that <lb/>
            capacity more than once.</p>
          <p>The statute was bad on this further ground, that it visited with several <lb/>
            penalties the trivial offence of petitioning the people for a privilege, <lb/>
             <pb n="5"/>
            contrary to an express law, which forbade more than one punishment <lb/>
            to be inflicted for any crime, even the most heinous.</p>
          <p>Lastly, it was highly reprehensible in seeking to bind the people for <lb/>
            ever to a practice which might not suit all times and circumstances. <lb/>
            The future was uncertain: it was impossible to see what measures <lb/>
            might become necessary hereafter. Citizens like Harmodius and <lb/>
            Aristogiton might again be needed. They should not be forbidden <lb/>
            to reward such men with the same honours as their predecessors. <lb/>
            Leptines had not taken the casualties of human life into account: <lb/>
            the spirit of his legislation was arrogant and offensive to Nemesis.</p>
          <p>He concludes with a brief peroration, summing up the general advan­ <lb/>
            tages to be obtained by a decision in his own favour, and the disad­ <lb/>
            vantages of an opposite course.</p>
          <p>We are assured by Dio Chrysostom, that these arguments prevailed <lb/>
            with the Athenians, and that the law of Leptines was repealed. <lb/>
            Some doubt has indeed been thrown upon this statement by Chris­ <lb/>
            topher Wordsworth in his interesting work upon Athens, which I <lb/>
            shall notice further in the first Appendix to this volume.</p>
          <p>IT was chiefly, men of the jury, because I deemed it good <lb/>
            for Athens that the law should be repealed, but partly on <lb/>
            account of the son of Chabrias,1 that I engaged to support <lb/>
            these men to the utmost of my ability. It is plain enough, <lb/>
            men of Athens, that Leptines, or whoever else defends the <lb/>
            law, will have nothing to say for it on the merits, but will <lb/>
            allege that certain unworthy persons obtaining immunity <lb/>
            have evaded the public services, and will lay the greatest <lb/>
            stress upon this point. I will pass by the injustice of such <lb/>
            a proceeding-for a complaint against some to take the <lb/>
            honour from all: for it has in a manner been explained, 2 and <lb/>
            is doubtless acknowledged by you: but this I would gladly <lb/>
            ask him.—Granting most fully, that not some but all were <lb/>
            unworthy, why did he consider that you and they were to be <lb/>
            dealt with alike? By enacting that none should be exempted, <note type="footnote"> 1 Ctesippus, the son of Chabrias, degenerating from his father's <lb/>
            virtues, became notorious as a spendthrift and a profligate. After <lb/>
            squandering all his property, he even sold the stones of his father's <lb/>
            monument, which the Athenians had erected at an expense of a thou­ <lb/>
            sand drachms. His name became a by-word among the comic writers. <lb/>
            Phocion, as we have seen (Vol. II. p. 324), vainly endeavoured to reform <lb/>
            him. It does not appear whether he had exhibited his vicious pro­ <lb/>
            pensities at the time when Leptines passed the law. Plutarch says, <lb/>
            that Demosthenes undertook the present cause to please the mother of <lb/>
            Ctesippus, whom he was then courting; though he did not marry her <lb/>
            after all, but espoused a Samian woman. Dinarchus asserts that he <lb/>
            lent his services to Ctesippus for a fee, as he did to many others. </note><note type="footnote"> * By Phormio, in the opening speech. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="6"/>
            he took the exemption from those that enjoyed it; by adding <lb/>
            that it should be unlawful to grant it hereafter, he deprived <lb/>
            you of the power of granting. He cannot surely say, that, <lb/>
            as he deprived the holders of their privilege, because he <lb/>
            deemed them unworthy of it, in the same manner he thought <lb/>
            the people unworthy to have the power of giving their own <lb/>
            to whom they pleased. But possibly he may reply, that he <lb/>
            framed the law so, because the people are easily misled. Then <lb/>
            what prevents your being deprived of everything, yea, of the <lb/>
            government itself, according to such argument ? For there is <lb/>
            not a single department of your affairs in which this has not <lb/>
            happened to you. Many decrees have you at various times <lb/>
            been entrapped into passing. You have been persuaded ere <lb/>
            now to choose the worse allies instead of the better. In <lb/>
            short, amid the variety of your measures, there must, I con­ <lb/>
            ceive, happen something of this kind occasionally. Shall we <lb/>
            therefore make a law, prohibiting the council and the people <lb/>
            hereafter from passing bills and decrees ? I scarcely think so. <lb/>
            We ought not to be deprived of a right, in the exercise of <lb/>
            which we have been deceived: rather should we be instructed <lb/>
            how to avoid such error, and pass a law, not taking away our <lb/>
            power, but giving the means of punishing those who deceive us.</p>
          <p>Dismissing this point however, if you consider simply, <lb/>
            which is the more advantageous;—that you should be com­ <lb/>
            petent to bestow the honour, but should sometimes be led <lb/>
            into error and bestow it upon worthless parties; or that, by <lb/>
            reason of the prohibition, you should be unable to reward <lb/>
            even one you know to be deserving; ;—you will find the former <lb/>
            is more to your advantage. Why ? Because, by honouring <lb/>
            too great a number, you incite many to serve you; but by <lb/>
            giving nothing, even to the deserving, you will deter all from <lb/>
            the ambition. And for this reason besides :-they who have <lb/>
            honoured unworthy parties may get the character of sim­ <lb/>
            plicity ; but they who do not justly requite their benefactors <lb/>
            have the reputation of meanness. In the same degree then <lb/>
            as it is better to be esteemed simple-minded than base, it is <lb/>
            more honourable to repeal the law than to enact it.</p>
          <p>Neither does it seem rational, 0 Athenians, when I come to <lb/>
            think of it, that, because he objects to some men having the <lb/>
            privileges which have been granted them, he should deprive <lb/>
            really deserving men of their honours. For if, as Leptines <lb/>
             <pb n="7"/>
            argues, there are worthless and good-for-nothing people not­ <lb/>
            withstanding these grants, what must. we expect, when good <lb/>
            men will have no manner of advantage ?</p>
          <p>And further you should bear in mind, that by the present <lb/>
            laws, which have long been in force, and the propriety of <lb/>
            which even my adversary will not dispute, each man takes <lb/>
            the public offices every other year, so that he is exempt for <lb/>
            half of his time.1 Then, when a moiety of this exemption is <lb/>
            enjoyed by all, even by those who have never rendered you <lb/>
            a mite of service, should we take away from our benefactors <lb/>
            the additional fraction that we have bestowed upon them ? <lb/>
            Never 1 It were neither honourable in itself, nor to you <lb/>
            becoming. How can it be otherwise than disgraceful, 0 <lb/>
            Athenians, that when a law has been passed commanding <lb/>
            truth to be spoken in the market-place, in matters where the <lb/>
            public is not hurt if a man tells a falsehood, the common­ <lb/>
            wealth, which has herself imposed this command upon private <lb/>
            citizens, does not observe the law in affairs of state, but has <lb/>
            defrauded her benefactors, even though she will suffer for it <lb/>
            greatly. For you have to consider, not merely whether you <lb/>
            lose money, but whether you lose also a good name, which <lb/>
            you are more anxious after than money ; and not you only, <lb/>
            but your ancestors, as I can prove: for, when they had got <lb/>
            wealth in abundance, they expended it all in the pursuit of <lb/>
            honour: for glory's sake they never shrank from any danger, <lb/>
            but persevered unto the last, spending even their private for­ <lb/>
            tunes.2 Instead of a good name, this statute fastens an oppro­ <lb/>
            brious one upon the commonwealth, unworthy both of your <lb/>
            ancestors and yourselves. It begets three of the greatest <lb/>
            reproaches-the reputation of being envious, faithless, un­ <lb/>
            grateful.</p>
          <p>That it is altogether foreign to your character, men of <lb/>
            Athens, to establish a law like this, I will endeavour to prove <lb/>
            in a few words by recounting one of the former acts of our <lb/>
            state. The Thirty3 are said to have borrowed money from <note type="footnote"> 1 See Appendix IL </note><note type="footnote"> 2 He refers to the exertions of the Athenians in the last years of the <lb/>
            Peloponnesian war. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Lysander persuaded the Lacedæmonians to lend a hundred talents <lb/>
            to support the Tyrants in Athens, B.C. 403. Thrasybulus with a band. <lb/>
            of exiles had seized the Piraeus, and was joined by all the popular <lb/>
            party. They defeated their opponents at Munychia, and killed Critias. A, </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="8"/>
            the Lacedæmonians to attack those in Piræus. When una­ <lb/>
            nimity was restored, and those troubles were composed, 1 the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians sent ambassadors and demanded payment of <lb/>
            their money. Upon this there arose a debate; and some <lb/>
            contended that the borrowers, the city party, should pay ; <lb/>
            others advised, that it should be the first proof of harmony <lb/>
            to join in discharging the debt: the people, they say, deter­ <lb/>
            mined themselves to contribute and share in the expense, to <lb/>
            avoid breaking any article of their convention. Then were it <lb/>
            not shameful, 0 Athenians, if at that time you chose to con­ <lb/>
            tribute money for the benefit of persons who had injured you <lb/>
            rather than break your word, yet now, when it is in your <lb/>
            power without cost to do justice to benefactors by repealing <lb/>
            the law, you should prefer to break your word? I for my <lb/>
            part would not advise it.2</p>
          <p>The character of the republic therefore, 0 Athenians, one <lb/>
            may see both by the example which I have cited, and by <note type="footnote"> \ <lb/>
            new government of Ten was then established, in place of the Thirty. <lb/>
            Lysander came to their assistance; but Pausanias, the Spartan king, <lb/>
            who was opposed to the designs of Lysander, effected a reconciliation <lb/>
            between the two Athenian parties, and, withdrawing the Peloponnesian <lb/>
            troops, allowed the democracy to be reestablished. A general act of <lb/>
            amnesty, which was faithfully observed, secured the state against fur­ <lb/>
            ther civil broils. The repayment of the Spartan loan was a wise measure <lb/>
            on the part of the Athenians, and is justly praised by the orators. <lb/>
            Isocrates, in his Areopagitic Oration (p. 153), thus speaks of it :­ </note><note type="footnote"> “ The victorious party who returned with arms in their hands (those <lb/>
            in Piraeus, I mean,) having destroyed the principal authors of the public <lb/>
            calamities, dealt so fairly and constitutionally with the rest, that the <lb/>
            party who had driven them into exile fared no worse than they who <lb/>
            returned. But the most noble and signal proof of the moderation of <lb/>
            the people was this :-The party that abode in the city had borrowed <lb/>
            a hundred talents from the Lacedæmonians, to besiege those who occu­ <lb/>
            pied Piræus. An assembly was held to consider the question of repay­ <lb/>
            ment; and many urged that the borrowers, and not the besieged party, <lb/>
            should discharge the debt of the Lacedæmonians; but the people deter­ <lb/>
            mined to pay it by general contribution." </note><note type="footnote"> The orators, in speaking of these transactions, call the Tyrants and <lb/>

            many others, to be what I say, truthful and upright, looking <lb/>
            not to pecuniary profit, but to what is honourable in action. <lb/>
            Of the character of him who framed the law I know nothing <lb/>
            in other respects; I say nothing against it, I am not aware of <lb/>
            anything; yet judging by the law, I find it to be far different <lb/>
            from yours. I say therefore, it would be more creditable for <lb/>
            him to follow you in repealing the law, than for you to <lb/>
            follow him in enacting it; and more advantageous to you <lb/>
            both, if the state should have persuaded Leptines to appear <lb/>
            like her, than if she were persuaded by Leptines to be like <lb/>
            him. For be he ever so honest, as I am quite willing to <lb/>
            admit, he is not better in character than the state.</p>
          <p>I think, men of the jury, it will assist your deliberations <lb/>
            upon the present question, when you learn also, that the <lb/>
            peculiar feature, which makes the gifts of popular govern­ <lb/>
            ments superior to the gifts bestowed by others, is in danger of <lb/>
            being destroyed by the law. In regard to the profit of those <lb/>
            who receive their bounty, despots and oligarchs can reward <lb/>
            the most highly; for they make whom they please imme­ <lb/>
            diately rich: but in regard to the honour and the security, you <lb/>
            will find the gifts of popular governments are preferable. For <lb/>
            that, instead of receiving the disgraceful meed of flattery, you <lb/>
            are in a free state rewarded for merit, is a circumstance of <lb/>
            glory: and it seems better to get the willing admiration of <lb/>
            your equals, than to receive anything from a master. In <lb/>
            despotic governments fear of the future is paramount to pre­ <lb/>
            sent obligation; but with you, whatever a man receives, he <lb/>
            may hold safely-might at least in former times. This law <lb/>
            therefore, which deprives gifts of their security, takes away <lb/>
            the only advantage by which your gifts are distinguished: and, <lb/>
            take from any government whatsoever the rule, that persons <lb/>
            well-affected to the establishment shall be recompensed,—you <lb/>
            will have taken away no Blight protection of the government.</p>
          <p>Possibly however, to withdraw your attention from these <lb/>
            points, Leptines will venture to say, that now the official <lb/>
            burdens fall upon poor men, but by the present law the most <lb/>
            wealthy will bear them. Specious enough to the ear so far : <lb/>
            examine it closely however, and it will appear to be false. <lb/>
            We have, as you know, services to be performed by the <lb/>
            resident aliens and by the citizens, from each of which certain <lb/>
            privileged persons have the exemption of which Leptines <lb/>
             <pb n="10"/>
            deprives them. From contributions for war and the public <lb/>
            safety, and from the service of the trierarchy, justly and pro­ <lb/>
            perly by our ancient laws no man is exempt, not even <lb/>
            those whom Leptines proposed, the descendants of Harmodius <lb/>
            and Aristogiton. Let us see then what additional parties1 <lb/>
            he finds for us to perform those services, and how many <lb/>
            he will let off, if we are against him. Our wealthiest men, <lb/>
            constantly serving the trierarchy, stand exempted from the <lb/>
            ordinary burdens, while those who possess an insufficient in­ <lb/>
            come, having an exemption by necessity, are out of the reach <lb/>
            of this liability:2 from neither of these classes therefore shall <lb/>
            we gain a contributor through the law. Oh, but he introduces <lb/>
            many new parties to perform the services of the resident <lb/>
            aliens. Well: if he can show five, I admit myself to be <lb/>
            talking nonsense. However I will assume this not to be so, <lb/>
            but that, if the law be established, the resident aliens charged <lb/>
            from time to time will be more than that number, and that <lb/>
            no citizen will stand exempt by reason of the trierarchy. Let <lb/>
            us see then what it will be to the commonwealth, if all these <lb/>
            persons perform the ordinary official services. It will be <lb/>
            found, I say, to be far from an equivalent for the disgrace <lb/>
            that must ensue. Look at it in this way. Of the aliens <lb/>
            there are exempt, let me suppose, ten: and decidedly, as I <lb/>
            said just now, I don't believe there are five. Of the citizens, <lb/>
            I am sure, there are scarcely five or six. Of both then sixteen. <lb/>
            Let us make them twenty, or if you like, thirty. Now let me <lb/>
            ask, what is the number of persons who perform the regular <lb/>
            services every year, choir-masters, gymnasiarchs, and feasters <lb/>
            of the tribes ? Perhaps sixty or a few more altogether. Then, <lb/>
            in order that thirty or more persons may bear the charges <lb/>
            during the whole time,3 should we cause all to regard us with <lb/>
            mistrust? Surely we know this, that, as long as the republic <lb/>
            subsists, there will be plenty performing official services, and <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">χορηοὺς</foreign> (as F. A. Wolf observes) is here used in the wider sense, <lb/>

            no failure of serviceable men, but none will be willing to confer <lb/>
            a benefit upon us, when they see former benefactors wronged. <lb/>
            Well: but if there were ever such a deficiency of parties able <lb/>
            to serve, which, in the name of Heaven, would be the better <lb/>
            course-to bring the ordinary services into partnership, like the <lb/>
            naval, or to deprive your benefactors of their gifts ? I should <lb/>
            think the former. As it is, he gives them a respite just for <lb/>
            the time that each of these persons bears a charge :1 after­ <lb/>
            wards each of them will spend as much as before. In the <lb/>
            other case, each paying a small contribution according to his <lb/>
            means, no man would suffer any hardship, however little he <lb/>
            possessed.</p>
          <p>There are persons however with so little of reason in them, <lb/>
            0 Athenians, that, although they venture not to contest these <lb/>
            arguments, they make assertions of another kind-that it is <lb/>
            monstrous, when the state has no funds of her own, that <lb/>
            individuals should become rich by having got hold of an im­ <lb/>
            munity. It is not just to couple these things together.2 If <lb/>
            a man has wealth without injuring you, surely one need not <note type="footnote">be charged were 600, and the persons annually charged 60, the law of <lb/>

            gested that when Demosthenes says, there are hardly five or six citizens <lb/>
            exempt, he means not those who have the grant of exemption by law, <lb/>
            but those who enjoy their exemption entirely by virtue of the grant, <lb/>
            excluding (according to his previous calculation) those rich enough to <lb/>
            be trierarchs, or too poor to be charged with any service. Such a <lb/>
            meaning however cannot fairly be got from the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀτελεῖς εισι</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Leptines eases the general body of men liable to serve for such <lb/>

            current year, are called upon to serve, some three persons out of the <lb/>

            grudge it to him. If they can say he has obtained it fraudu­ <lb/>
            lently or in any improper way, there are laws by which they <lb/>
            may punish him; but when they decline to take such course, <lb/>
            they should forbear also to use this language. With reference <lb/>
            to the state having no funds, you must consider, that you <lb/>
            will be no better off by taking away the immunities: for <lb/>
            these expenses have no connexion with the public revenues and <lb/>
            treasures. And besides-there being now two advantages for <lb/>
            the stater' wealth and general confidence; the confidence that <lb/>
            we actually enjoy is the more valuable. Yet if any one thinks, <lb/>
            that, because we have no money, we ought likewise to have no <lb/>
            good name, he reasons badly. My prayer to the gods is, that, <lb/>
            if possible, we may have wealth also in abundance, but that at <lb/>
            all events we may maintain our character of being trustworthy <lb/>
            and truthful.</p>
          <p>But come, I will prove that the affluence, which my oppo­ <lb/>
            nents will tell you some men will derive from their relief, is <lb/>
            to your advantage. You are of course aware, that no man is <lb/>
            exempt from the navy-charge or the war-taxes. Well then: <lb/>
            this man of wealth, whoever he is, will contribute largely to <lb/>
            these expenses: no doubt of it. And all will agree, that our <lb/>
            means of providing for these services ought to be the most <lb/>
            ample: for by the expenditure in choral exhibitions pleasure <lb/>
            is given to the spectators only for a brief portion of a day ; <lb/>
            but by unstinted supplies for the service of war safety accrues <lb/>
            to the commonwealth for ever. So that as much as you <lb/>
            relinquish here, you gain there; and you give by way of <lb/>
            honour what, even if not given, may be had by those whose <lb/>
            estate is equal to the trierarchy. That no man is exempt <lb/>
            from the navy-charges, I believe you are all aware: however <lb/>
            he shall read you the law itself. Take the navy law and read <lb/>
            just that part:</p>

            except the nine archons." <note type="footnote"> 1 That is, two advantages which the state may possess, or may seek <lb/>
            to possess. Auger translates it with much clearness: " Ajoutez que des <lb/>

            des peuples, la confiance qu'on a maintenant en elle est le plus précieux.” <lb/>
            Pabst: Ausserdem i8t, wenn unser Stoat zwischen den beiden Gütern, <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>You see, men of Athens, how clearly the law has expressed, <lb/>
            that none but the nine archons. shall be exempt from the <lb/>
            trierarchal service. Well then: they whose property is below <lb/>
            the amount qualifying for the trierarchy pay a war-contribu­ <lb/>
            tion in the property tax: they who come up to the trierarchy <lb/>
            will be serviceable to us for both purposes, the trierarchy and <lb/>
            the property-tax. What ease then, Leptines, does your law <lb/>
            give to the people, if it creates one choir-master 1 for one <lb/>
            or two tribes, who, after once performing this service instead <lb/>
            of some other party, will be free ? I cannot see. It fills the <lb/>
            whole city however with shame and mistrust. When there­ <lb/>
            fore the damage that it will do is far greater than the benefit <lb/>
            which it brings, ought it not to be repealed in this court ? I <lb/>
            should say so.</p>
          <p>Again, men of the jury: as there is an express clause in <lb/>
            his statute, that no one, whether citizen, denizen, or alien, <lb/>
            shall be exempt, but it does not say exempt from what, whe­ <lb/>
            ther from the office of choir-master or what other charge, but <lb/>
            simply that no one shall be exempt but the descendants of <lb/>
            Harmodius and Aristogiton; and as under the term “ no one” <lb/>
            it comprehends all other persons in the world, and the term <lb/>
            “ alien" it does not confine to those dwelling at Athens; <lb/>
            it deprives even Leucon, ruler of the Bosporus,3 and his <note type="footnote"> 1 Perhaps, as Schaefer thinks, <foreign xml:lang="grc">χορηγὸν</foreign> may here again be used in the <lb/>
            wider sense. The commentators torture their brains to make this <lb/>
            square with the previous calculations of Demosthenes. There is no <lb/>
            necessity for taking such pains. The orator speaks loosely in this pas­ <lb/>

            Gymnasiarch, &amp;c., which were performed by citizens and other residents <lb/>
            in Athens. The term <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀτελής</foreign> however, unrestricted by qualifying <lb/>
            words, might extend to the customs and other imposts payable by <lb/>
            foreigners trading with the Athenians; and therefore Demosthenes <lb/>
            argues that Leucon, king of the Bosporus, would by the new law be <lb/>
            deprived of his exemption from duties. Not having the whole of the <lb/>
            statute before us, but only those parts of it which are quoted by Demo­ <lb/>
            sthenes, we are unable to judge whether his construction of this par­ <lb/>
            ticular clause be the true one. There may have been words of recital <lb/>
            in the introductory part of the statute, which showed the true applica­ <lb/>
            tion of the term <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀτελής</foreign>, according to the well-known maxim both of <lb/>
            law and common sense, that the meaning of a doubtful expression may <lb/>
            be gathered from the context. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 The Tauric Chersonese, now the Crimea, was, as may be learned <lb/>

            children of the gift that you bestowed upon them. For <lb/>
            Leucon; as you know, is by birth an alien, though by your <lb/>
            adoption a citizen: in neither respect however can he have <lb/>
            immunity according to this law. Now, whilst our other <lb/>
            benefactors have each made themselves useful to us for a par­ <lb/>
            ticular period, Leucon, you will find, never ceases to confer <lb/>
            benefits upon us, and such benefits as our country stands <lb/>
            most in need of. You are of course aware, that we consume <lb/>
            more foreign corn than any people in the world. But the corn <lb/>
            which comes in from the Euxine equals the whole quantity <lb/>
            that comes from other markets; and no wonder: not only <lb/>
            because that district has an abundance of corn, but because <note type="footnote"> first of the Greeks who carried their commerce to these parts were the <lb/>
            Milesians, who at an early period established divers colonies on both <lb/>
            sides of the Euxine sea, and penetrated as far as the Cimmerian Bos­ <lb/>
            porus, where they founded on the coast the cities of Panticapæum (or <lb/>
            Bosporus) and Phanagoria. The commerce of the Euxine enriched <lb/>
            Miletus, and preserved her influence over her colonies; until at last she <lb/>
            fell under the Persian yoke, and this connexion was broken. When <lb/>
            Athens became a naval power, the whole coast from the Hellespont to <lb/>
            the PaIns Mæotis was visited by her merchants, who succeeded to the <lb/>
            trade of the Milesians. From the Tauric Chersonese they exported not <lb/>
            only corn, but salt-fish, honey, wax, wool, hides, fleeces, timber, and <lb/>
            slaves, (most of which articles are exported from the Crimea to this <lb/>
            day;) and they imported in return the wines of Mende, Thasos, Cos, <lb/>
            and other Ægæan islands ; and all kinds of manufactures from Athens, <lb/>
            such as armour, cloth, leather, hardware, earthenware, sculpture, jewel­ <lb/>
            lery, &amp;c. For some time the Athenians possessed a fort or factory on <lb/>
            the Tauric coast, called Nymphæum, which, towards the close of the <lb/>
            Peloponnesian war, was given up to the sovereign of the country by <lb/>
            Gylon, the maternal grandfather of Demosthenes. For, soon after the <lb/>
            Milesian fleets had disappeared from the Euxine, the Tauric peninsula <lb/>
            fell under the dominion of a king, the founder of a most flourishing <lb/>
            dynasty, called the Archæanactidæ, which was transmitted through a <lb/>
            long line of succession to the time of Mithridates, by whom the king­ <lb/>
            dom was annexed to his own. Satyrus, the father of Leucon, was killed <lb/>
            at the siege of Theodosia, B. o. 393. He is mentioned by Isocrates as a <lb/>
            friend of Athens. Leucon succeeded him, and reigned forty years. He <lb/>
            took Theodosia (the modern Caffa), which was an important emporium <lb/>
            for trade, lying more southward than Panticapæum, and having a more <lb/>
            convenient harbour. He continued to favour the Athenians, as his <lb/>
            father had done; and they honoured him not only with exemption <lb/>
            from all duties, but with an inscription upon a pillar, recording his <lb/>
            liberal conduct. The wisdom and good fortune of this prince, both in <lb/>
            war and peace, are attested by divers ancient writers, referred to in the <lb/>
            notes of F. A. Wolf </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="15"/>
            Leucon, who reigns there, has granted exemption from duty to <lb/>
            those who export to Athens, and issues an order, that mer­ <lb/>
            chants bound for our port shall load their vessels first. <lb/>
            Having the exemption for himself and his children, he has <lb/>
            given it to all of you. Observe what an important thing it is. <lb/>
            He takes a thirtieth from all who export corn from his <lb/>
            dominions. Now the measures1 of corn that come from his <lb/>
            country are about four hundred thousand; as one may see <lb/>
            from the entry kept by the corn-inspectors. Therefore, for <lb/>
            the three hundred thousand measures he gives us ten <lb/>
            thousand, and for the hundred thousand about three thou­ <lb/>
            sand. And so far is he from depriving our commonwealth of <lb/>
            this boon, that when he made a new harbour at Theodosia, <lb/>
            which the mariners say is not at all inferior to Bosporus, he <lb/>
            gave us the exemption there also. Many other instances <lb/>
            which I could mention, of benefits conferred upon you by <lb/>
            this prince and his ancestors, I pass by: but the year before <lb/>
            last, when there was a scarcity among all men, he sent you <lb/>
            not only a plentiful supply of corn, but at such a price, that <lb/>
            there was a surplus of fifteen talents in the hands of Callis­ <lb/>
            thenes. What then, 0 Athenians, do you expect of this man <lb/>
            who has been such a friend to you, if he should hear that you <lb/>
            have by law deprived him of his exemption, and disabled <lb/>
            yourselves from granting it if you should change your minds <lb/>
            hereafter? Are you ignorant that this same law, should it <lb/>
            be confirmed, will deprive of exemption both him and all <lb/>
            Athenians who carry corn from his kingdom? Surely no one <lb/>
            imagines, that he will submit to have your gifts to him <lb/>
            revoked, while his to you remain. Thus, in addition to many <lb/>
            injuries which are likely to result to you from the law, it <lb/>
            deprives you of some advantages immediately. And are you <lb/>
            still considering whether you should abolish it, or have you <lb/>
            not decided long ago ?</p>

            men of the jury. Pillars on which all this is copied have <lb/>
            been set up by you and him, one in Bosporus, one in Piræus, <lb/>
            another at Hieron.1 Only consider to what extreme disgrace <lb/>
            you are brought by this statute, which makes the people <lb/>
            appear less trustworthy than a single man. Be assured that <lb/>
            these pillars stand for contracts to bind your mutual pro­ <lb/>
            mises. Leucon, as it will appear, abides by them, and is <lb/>
            always desirous to do you service: you have invalidated them <lb/>
            while they are yet standing, which is far more shameful than <lb/>
            pulling them down; for now they will stand as evidence for <lb/>
            persons who choose to malign the commonwealth in veri­ <lb/>
            fication of their charges.</p>
          <p>But come, suppose Leucon sends to us and asks, for what <lb/>
            ground of complaint or objection you have deprived him of <lb/>
            his immunity, what, in the name of Heaven, shall we say ? <lb/>
            what shall be stated by the person who prepares the decree <lb/>
            for us? Peradventure, that some of the privileged parties <lb/>
            were unworthy. Suppose then he should reply—“ Well : <lb/>
            some of the Athenians, I guess, are bad men, and I have not <lb/>
            therefore deprived the good; but, considering the people <lb/>
            good, I allow all to have the exemption." Will not his <lb/>
            language be fairer than ours? I certainly think so. It is <lb/>
            more usual with all men, to be kind for the sake of their <lb/>
            benefactors even to some worthless individuals, than on <lb/>
            account of the worthless to take back their gifts from persons <lb/>
            confessedly meritorious. I really am unable to see, how <lb/>
            people are to be prevented from tendering the exchange 2 to <lb/>
            Leucon if they please. For he always has effects at Athens, <lb/>
            and according to this law, if any one comes upon them, he <note type="footnote"> 1 A place on the coast of the Euxine, between the Thracian Bosporus <lb/>

            adoption, would be liable to serve the offices of trierarch, choregus, &amp;c.; <lb/>
            which liability would attach upon him in respect of the property which <lb/>
            he continually had in Athens or Piræus; for example, merchant-vessels <lb/>
            and their cargoes. Any citizen called upon to serve one of these offices, <lb/>
            who thought Leucon's visible estate greater than his own, might (as <lb/>
            Demosthenes contends) offer him the exchange: as to which see Vol. I. <lb/>
            Appendices III. and IV. In that event Leucon's property would be liable <lb/>
            to be seized under legal process. Whether such a case fell within the <lb/>
            scope of the law, seems doubtful; and that there was a doubt, may be <lb/>

            However, it is not the pecuniary cost that will be his chief <lb/>
            grievance, but the feeling that you have taken your gift away <lb/>
            from him.</p>
          <p>But you have not only to see, men of Athens, that Leucon <lb/>
            be not wronged, whose anxiety about his privilege would be <lb/>
            for the sake of honour and not emolument, but that no one <lb/>
            else be wronged, who has befriended you in the day of his <lb/>
            prosperity, and to whom the grant of exemption which you <lb/>
            then made him has come to be an advantage. Who answers <lb/>
            this description? Epicerdes of Cyrene,l who, if any man <lb/>
            that ever received this honour was deserving of it, was justly <lb/>
            held to be so, not because his donations were large or striking <lb/>
            in amount, but because they were given upon an occasion, <lb/>
            when even among those who had received obligations from <lb/>
            you it was difficult to find any willing to remember them. <lb/>
            For Epicerdes, as this decree passed in his favour shows, gave <lb/>
            a hundred minas to your countrymen who were captured in <lb/>
            Sicily, when that terrible disaster had befallen them, and was <lb/>
            the principal means of their not all dying of hunger. After­ <lb/>
            wards, when you had granted him immunity on this account, <lb/>
            seeing in the war 2 just before the time of the Thirty that the <lb/>
            people were in need of money, he gave a talent of his own <lb/>
            accord and unasked. By Jupiter and the Gods! consider, <lb/>
            0 Athenians, how could a man more signally display his <lb/>
            good-will to you, or less deserve to be wronged, than he­ <lb/>
            when in the first place he was present at the misfortune of <lb/>
            Athens, and yet chose the side of the unfortunate and the <lb/>
            chance of their future gratitude in preference to the party <lb/>
            who were at that time victorious, and among whom he was <lb/>
            dwelling: and seeing another occasion of distress, be was <note type="footnote"> 1 It is most probable that Epicerdes' himself was not alive at the <lb/>

            and who (as the Scholiast informs us) had migrated from Cyrene to <lb/>
            Athens. It is, as F. A. Wolf truly observes, a part of the rhetorical <lb/>
            artifice of Demosthenes, to identify the father with his children, where <lb/>
            the immunity had been extended to them; and to make it appear that <lb/>

          <p>The kindnesses, in return for which Epicerdes obtained his <lb/>
            immunity, you have heard from the decrees, men of the jury. <lb/>
            I would have you consider, not that he gave a hundred minas <lb/>
            and again a talent, (for even they who received it, I imagine, <lb/>
            were not struck by the magnitude of the sum,) but his zeal <lb/>
            and his volunteering the service, and the occasions on which <lb/>
            he rendered it. Doubtless all people deserve requital who are <lb/>
            the first to do acts of kindness, but especially those who do them <lb/>
            in times of need; and one of those is Epicerdes clearly. And <lb/>
            are we not ashamed, 0 Athenians, that we should have for­ <lb/>
            gotten all this, and from the children of such a man taken <lb/>
            away their privilege without any cause of complaint ? Though <lb/>
            the people who were then saved by him and granted the <lb/>
            immunity are different from you who now take it away, that <lb/>
            does not acquit you of the shame: nay, that itself is the <lb/>
            worst part of it. For when the witnesses and objects of his <lb/>
            bounty thought it merited such a grant, should we, who hear <lb/>
            it by report only, revoke the grant as unworthily bestowed,2 <lb/>
            how can our conduct be otherwise than atrocious ? I have <lb/>
            the same argument also for those who put down the Four <note type="footnote"> 1 Demosthenes has hitherto mentioned only the decrees in favour of <lb/>
            Leucon and Epicerdes; but Phormio had brought others before the <lb/>
            notice of the jury, (as we learn from page 472,) and Demosthenes him­ <lb/>
            self was about to cite further examples, (472—476.) By the words, <lb/>

            consider, first, that he is about to give his vote upon a law <lb/>
            which if not repealed we shall have to act upon; secondly, <lb/>
            that bad laws injure even states which imagine themselves <lb/>
            securely established. Revolutions would never have happened <lb/>
            for better and for worse, but that people who stood in danger <lb/>
            were set up again by good measures and laws, by honest men, <lb/>
            and by careful attention to all things, while those who ap­ <lb/>
            peared to be in full prosperity were gradually undermined by <lb/>
            the total neglect of all. Mankind in general acquire their <lb/>
            good fortune by prudent counsel and by thinking nothing <lb/>
            beneath them; yet they are unwilling to preserve it by the <lb/>
            same means. Fall not you into this error now: do not <lb/>
            determine for a law, which, while the commonwealth is <lb/>
            flourishing, will fill it with evil repute, and, if anything <lb/>
            should happen hereafter, will bereave it of people disposed to <lb/>
            serve you.</p>
          <p>Nor is it only men who chose to befriend you privately, and <lb/>
            who made themselves useful on those important occasions <lb/>

            designed after the battle not to receive the troops within their <lb/>
            walls, but to treat with the Lacedæmonians for peace, those <lb/>
            men, seeing our commonwealth in misfortune and the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians masters of the pass, did not abandon us or take <lb/>
            selfish counsel for their own safety, but, though all the Pelo­ <lb/>

            spite of the multitude, and chose rather to share with your <lb/>
            army whatever calamity was in store for them, than to obtain <lb/>
            a certain deliverance without you; and they admitted the <lb/>
            troops, and preserved both you and your allies. Afterwards, <lb/>

            <title type="sub">[The Decree</title>
          </ab>
          <p>This, men of the jury, is the decree which you passed in <lb/>
            favour of the Corinthians exiled on your account. Bethink <lb/>
            you: should any person acquainted with those events, either <lb/>
            from having taken a part in them or by report from an eye­ <lb/>
            witness, hear afterwards of this statute annulling the rewards <lb/>
            then bestowed; how base in his judgment would the legis­ <lb/>
            lators appear! we who at the period of our distress were so <lb/>
            liberal, so ready to do anything, but, after obtaining all that <lb/>
            we could desire, are so mean and ungrateful as to have <lb/>
            deprived the holders of our gifts, and to have passed a law <lb/>
            prohibiting us from making any such gifts in future! Oh, <lb/>
            but some of the persons who obtained them were undeserving. <lb/>
            That will run through their whole argument. Then we shall <lb/>
            admit our. ignorance of this principle, that the desert should <lb/>
            be weighed at the time of giving, not an immense time after­ <lb/>
            wards. To abstain from giving at all is the part of prudent <lb/>
            men; to take away what has been given is the part of envious <lb/>
            men: and you must not be thought to have such a feeling. <lb/>
            But on the point of merit itself I shall not hesitate to de­ <lb/>
            clare to you my opinion. A state, I conceive, is not to judge <lb/>
            whether a man is deserving on the same principles as an in­ <lb/>
            dividual : for the subjects of inquiry are not the same.1 In <lb/>
            private each of us considers who is fit to be connected with him <lb/>
            in marriage or the like; and such questions are determined by <lb/>
            certain laws and opinions: but a state and a people look for <note type="footnote"> by Demosthenes, to make his hearers thoroughly ashamed of the error <lb/>

            able. In one of his letters to Home Tooke he says—“ You will not <lb/>
            suspect me of setting up Wilkes for a perfect character. The question <lb/>
            to the public is; where shall we find a man, who, with purer principles, <lb/>

            when we need a service, shall we allow any one that likes to­ <lb/>
            render it; and, after we have received it, shall we inquire into <lb/>
            the merit of him that served us ? It will not be a righteous <lb/>
            policy.</p>
          <p>But perhaps these are the only men who will be so treated, <lb/>
            and all my argument concerns them alone. Nothing of the <lb/>
            kind. I would not attempt to call over the whole list of your <lb/>
            benefactors, who through the law, if it be not repealed, will <lb/>
            be deprived of their gifts. I will produce one or two more <lb/>
            decrees, and then pass from that topic. First then-Is it not <lb/>
            clear that, if you take away the immunity, you will wrong <lb/>
            the Thasians 1 of the party of Ecphantus, who by delivering <lb/>
            Thasos to you, and forcibly expelling the Lacedæmonian gar­ <lb/>
            rison, introducing Thrasybulus, and making their country <lb/>
            your friend, caused the district about Thrace to become allied <lb/>
            to you ? Again-will you not wrong Archebius and Hera­ <lb/>
            elides, who by delivering Byzantium to Thrasybulus made <lb/>
            you masters of the Hellespont, so that you let the tithe, and <lb/>
            getting ample funds, compelled the Lacedæmonians to make <lb/>
            peace on such terms as you desired ? When they were ex­ <lb/>
            pelled afterwards from their country, men of Athens, you <lb/>
            voted what I conceive was proper for benefactors. in exile on <lb/>
            your account, the title of state-friends and benefactors,3 and <note type="footnote"> 1 The events here referred to belong to the year B. c. 407, when Thra-­ <lb/>

            At the same time he recovered other places on the coast of Thrace. <lb/>

            country the duty of a tenth, which the Byzantines used to charge on <lb/>
            ships coming from the Euxine. (See Xenophon, Hellen. iv. c. 8, s. 27.) <lb/>
            The peace referred to by Demosthenes is that of Antalcidas, which, <lb/>
            though its advantages are here overstated by the orator, was so far <lb/>
            favourable that it left Athens independent, with her long walls re­ <lb/>
            stored, and with Lemnos, Imbrus, and Scyrus restored to her dominion. <lb/>
            Compare the exaggerated terms in which he describes the peace granted <lb/>
            by the Spartans to Olynthus. (De Fals. Leg. 425.) </note><note type="footnote"> 3 The title of Benefactor was occasionally conferred by states and <lb/>

            exemption from all imposts. Then should we suffer men <lb/>
            exiled on your account, who justly received your bounty, to <lb/>
            be deprived of what you gave them without any cause of <lb/>
            complaint ? It would be disgraceful; as you will clearly see, <lb/>
            if you will put the following case to yourselves: Suppose <lb/>
            some of the people who now hold Pydna or Potidsea, or any of <lb/>
            the other places which are subject to Philip and hostile to <lb/>
            you, (just as Thasos and Byzantium then were friendly to the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians and estranged from you,) should offer to <lb/>
            deliver them up, if you would give them the same rewards <lb/>
            which you gave to Ecphantus of Thasos and Archebius of <lb/>
            Byzantium, and some of these men opposed them, urging <lb/>
            that it was monstrous for any of the resident aliens to escape <lb/>
            the public burdens, while the rest did not: what would be <lb/>
            your feelings towards the men who urged such an argument? <lb/>
            Need I ask? Would you not treat them as malignants 1 and <lb/>
            refuse to hear them ? It is disgraceful then, if, in the expec­ <lb/>
            tation of benefit, you would regard a person so arguing as a <lb/>
            malignant, yet, on a question of taking away the rewards of <lb/>
            previous benefactors, you will listen to men so arguing. But <lb/>
            further—let us consider-by what were the persons who <lb/>
            betrayed Pydna and the other places to Philip induced to <lb/>
            wrong us ? Every one must see, by the rewards which they <lb/>
            expected to get from him for the service. Which then, Lep­ <lb/>
            tines, should you rather do-persuade our enemies, if you <lb/>
            can, not to reward persons who become their benefactors in <lb/>
            wronging us, or introduce a statute here, which takes away a <lb/>
            portion of the rewards enjoyed by our benefactors? I should <lb/>

          <p>You heard the decrees, men of the jury. Perhaps some <lb/>
            of these men no longer live: but their deeds live after they <lb/>
            have once been done. It becomes you therefore to let <lb/>
            these pillars remain in force for ever, that, as long as any <lb/>
            men exist, they may suffer no wrong from you, and, when <lb/>
            they die, the pillars may be a monument of the character of <lb/>
            Athens, and stand for examples to all who wish to befriend <lb/>
            you, that Athens has requited those who rendered her <lb/>
            service.</p>
          <p>And let it not escape you, 0 Athenians, that it would be <lb/>
            one of the deepest disgraces, were all people to see and hear, <lb/>
            that the calamities which these men have suffered on your <lb/>
            account have been made to endure for ever, while the gifts <lb/>
            which they received from you as a recompense have been <lb/>
            thus early abolished. Much more befitting were it that you <lb/>
            left the gifts to mitigate their misfortunes, than that during <lb/>
            their continuance you took the gifts away. For, in Heaven's <lb/>
            name, what man will be willing to serve you, if in case of <lb/>
            failure he is to be punished instantly by your enemies, <lb/>
            and in the event of success he cannot depend upon your <lb/>
            gratitude ?</p>
          <p>I should be sorry indeed, men of the jury, did it appear <lb/>
            I had but this ground of complaint against the law, that it <lb/>
            deprives many foreign benefactors of the immunity, but was <lb/>
            unable to show that any of our citizens who have obtained <lb/>
            the honour were deserving of it. I would pray that all <lb/>
            blessings may be most abundant among ourselves, and spe­ <lb/>
            cially that the most and best of our benefactors may be our <lb/>
            own citizens. First then look at Conon: 1 see whether you <note type="footnote"> 1 Conon first becomes known to us as one of the Athenian com­ <lb/>
            manders in the last years of the Peloponnesian war. From Ægospo­ <lb/>

            colleagues, he escaped with eight ships to Cyprus, and found an asylum <lb/>
            with his friend Evagoras, who had raised himself to the sovereignty of <lb/>
            the island. Here Conon remained quiet, until Persia was threatened <lb/>
            with war by the Lacedæmonians, when he obtained a naval command <lb/>
            in the kings service. In the year B. C. 397 he liberated Rhodes from <lb/>
            the Spartan dominion, and restored the democracy. When the war of </note> <lb/>

            can find any fault either with the man or with his achieve­ <lb/>
            ments, to justify you in revoking any of his honours. He, <lb/>
            as you may learn from some of your own body who were his <lb/>
            contemporaries, after the return of the popular party from <lb/>
            the Piræus, when our commonwealth was weak and possessed <lb/>
            not a single vessel, 1 he, I say, commanding for the king, <lb/>
            without having received the least supply from you, beat the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians at sea, and accustomed a people lately com­ <lb/>
            manding others to hearken unto you, and expelled their <lb/>
            governors from the islands, and afterwards came home and <lb/>
            rebuilt the walls, and was the first person who again put us <lb/>
            in a condition to dispute with Lacedæmon for the leadership. <lb/>
            He is indeed the only man in whose honour this has been <lb/>
            inscribed upon the pillar—“ Since Conon " (it says) " libe­ <lb/>
            rated the allies of Athens." This inscription, men of the <lb/>
            jury, is glorious to him in your eyes,2 to you in the opinion <lb/>
            of all Greece : for whatever advantage any among us procures <lb/>
            for others, the name of the commonwealth enjoys the repu­ <lb/>
            tation of it. Therefore the Athenians of that day not only <lb/>
            granted immunity to him, but erected a brazen statue, as <lb/>
            they did to Harmodius and Aristogiton, the first after theirs :3 <note type="footnote"> 395 B. c. broke out in Greece, he made a journey to the Persian court, <lb/>
            and obtained a large supply of money from Artaxerxes, who appointed <lb/>
            him and Pharnabazus joint admirals of the royal fleet. In the following <lb/>
            year he gained the battle of Cnidus, in which the Lacedæmonian fleet, <lb/>
            commanded by Pisander, was totally overthrown. After this he sailed <lb/>
            with Pharnabazus round the Ægæan, and expelled the Spartan Har­ <lb/>
            mostæ from most of the islands; he also took Cythera, and ravaged the <lb/>
            enemy's coasts. But the most gratifying of all his exploits to the <lb/>
            Athenians was that which followed. He carried his victorious fleet <lb/>
            (with the permission of Pharnabazus) to Athens, and with the help of. <lb/>
            his seamen and a large supply of Persian gold he restored the long <lb/>
            walls which connected Athens and Piræus. This work was completed <lb/>
            about the year B. c. 390. (See Thirlwall's History of Greece, iv. pp. <lb/>

          <p>Nor was it by you alone, men of Athens, that Conon was <lb/>
            thus rewarded for the deeds which I have mentioned, but by <lb/>
            many others, who justly deemed it right to repay the benefits <lb/>
            which they had received. It would be shameful then, men <lb/>
            of Athens, when the honours conferred elsewhere are secured <lb/>
            to him, that from yours alone this portion should be taken <lb/>
            away. Nor again would it be very creditable, to assign him <lb/>
            in his lifetime all these honours which you have heard, because <lb/>
            you esteemed him so highly, and yet after his death to forget <lb/>
            it all, and take away a portion of what was given him. Many <lb/>
            of his achievements are worthy of praise, 0 Athenians, and <lb/>
            on all their accounts you are bound not to annul their <lb/>
            rewards; but the noblest of them is the restoration of our <lb/>
            walls. You may judge by comparing how Themistocles, the <lb/>
            most renowned man of his day, accomplished the same feat. <lb/>
            The story is,1 that he desired his countrymen to begin building, <lb/>
            and instructed them to detain any one that should come from <lb/>
            Lacedæmon; he went off himself as ambassador to the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians, and at a conference with them, it being <lb/>
            reported that the Athenians were building their wall, he <lb/>
            denied it, and bade them send ambassadors to inquire, and, <lb/>
            when they did not return, he advised them to send others. <lb/>
            And doubtless you have all heard in what manner he is <lb/>
            reported to have tricked the Lacedæmonians. I say then­ <lb/>
            .and by heavens! men of Athens, let no one be angry at what <lb/>
            he is about to hear, but consider if it be true :-as it is better <lb/>
            to act openly than clandestinely, and more glorious to accom­ <lb/>
            plish anything by victory than by deceit; to the same extent <note type="footnote"> monians at sea; and this advice was given for the benefit of the Greeks; <lb/>
            for if the Lacedæmonians were beaten on land, the king would have had <lb/>
            all the advantage of it, but if their naval power was destroyed, it would <lb/>
            help to liberate the Greek cities from their dominion. The result <lb/>
            proved the wisdom of their counsel. The Athenians placed their <lb/>
            statues near to that of Jupiter the Deliverer. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 See Thucydides, i. 90—93. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="27"/>
            did Conon raise the walls more honourably than Themistocles. <lb/>
            The one effected it secretly, the other by vanquishing the <lb/>
            people who would have prevented it. Such a man therefore <lb/>
            ought not to be wronged by you, or to come off worse than <lb/>
            the orators, who are to show cause why any of his gifts should <lb/>
            be taken away.</p>
          <p>Well, but let us allow the son of Chabrias to be deprived <lb/>
            of the immunity, which his father justly received from you <lb/>
            and bequeathed to him. Why, I scarcely think any man in <lb/>
            his senses would say this was proper. You know probably <lb/>
            without my telling you, that Chabrias was a noble man: yet <lb/>
            there is nothing to prevent my briefly mentioning his per­ <lb/>
            formances. In what manner he took the field with you <lb/>
            against all the Peloponnesians at Thebes,1 and how he slew <lb/>
            Gorgopas in Ægina, 2 and how many trophies he raised in <lb/>
            Cyprus, and afterwards in Egypt, 3 and how, traversing as he <lb/>
            did almost every place, he nowhere disgraced the name of the <note type="footnote"> 1 More strictly he should have said, " near Thebes." The event <lb/>
            occurred during the campaign of Agesilaus in Bœotia, B. c. 378, and is <lb/>
            thus described by Thirlwall (History of Greece, v. 45): " The Athenian <lb/>
            and Theban troops were advantageously posted on the range of hills <lb/>
            two miles south of the city; yet Agesilaus thought himself strong <lb/>
            enough to attack them. He first sent his targeteers against them, and <lb/>
            when these were repulsed, advanced to the charge with his phalanx. <lb/>
            Chabrias ordered his men to keep their ground, pointing their spears <lb/>
            against the enemy, and resting their shields upon one knee; Gorgidas <lb/>
            followed his example. The attitude was new, and indicated a spirit <lb/>
            which might make the victory doubtful; and Agesilaus thought it <lb/>
            prudent to sound a retreat. The manoeuvre acquired so much celebrity, <lb/>
            that a statue was afterwards erected to Chabrias at Athens, in the atti­ <lb/>
            tude which he had devised; and it seems to have hastened the enemy's <lb/>
            retreat from the Theban territory." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Gorgopas commanded a Lacedæmonian squadron stationed at <lb/>
            Ægina, from which he infested the coasts of Attica, and assisted the <lb/>
            Æginetans in their piratical excursions. Chabrias landing in the island <lb/>
            surprised and slew him in an ambuscade, and by this means freed the <lb/>
            Athenian commerce for a time from plunder. This happened B.C. 388, <lb/>
            one year before the peace of Antalcidas. (See Xenophon, Hellen. v. c. 1, <lb/>
            a. 10—13.) </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Chabrias was sent to assist Evagoras against the forces of the <lb/>
            Persian monarchy, B.C. 390. This was the Cyprian war, which lasted <lb/>
            ten years, and ended by the submission of Evagoras. In the year B. c. <lb/>
            377 Chabrias went to Egypt, to command the Greek mercenaries of <lb/>
            Acoris, but was recalled by the Athenians. In B. c. 362, he was engaged <lb/>
            by Tachos, king of Egypt, to command his fleet. See the Chronological <lb/>

            to speak of as they deserve, and it would be a shame that in <lb/>
            my description they should fall below the' opinion which you <lb/>
            each entertain of him. Those however which no language <lb/>
            of mine could degrade I will endeavour to recal to your <lb/>
            minds. He vanquished the Lacedæmonians at seal and cap­ <lb/>
            tured forty-nine galleys: he took the greater number of these <lb/>
            islands and delivered them up to you, and made them friendly, <lb/>
            when before they were hostile; he carried to Athens three <lb/>
            thousand prisoners, and brought in more than a hundred and <lb/>
            ten talents, the spoil of the enemy. To all these facts some <lb/>
            of the eldest among you can bear me witness. And besides, <lb/>
            he captured above twenty galleys more, taking them one and <lb/>
            two at a time; all of which he brought into your harbours. <lb/>
            To sum up the whole: he is the only general who never lost2 <lb/>
            a single city or post or ship or soldier, when he commanded <lb/>
            you: none of your enemies has any trophy over you and <lb/>
            him, while you have many over many enemies under his <lb/>
            command.</p>
          <p>That I may not in my speech omit any of his actions, the <lb/>
            clerk shall read you the catalogue of ships that he took, and <lb/>
            where he took each, and the number of cities, and the quan­ <lb/>

            peached him for treason, and on conviction he would have <lb/>
            been lost for ever: and yet when, instead of this, he took <lb/>
            seventeen cities, captured seventy ships and three thousand <lb/>
            prisoners, and returned to the treasury a hundred and ten <lb/>
            talents, and raised such a number of trophies, his rewards <lb/>
            after all are not to be secured to him! Chabrias, 0 Athenians, <lb/>
            will be shown not only to have achieved everything for you <lb/>
            in his lifetime, but to have lost his life in the same cause: so <lb/>
            that on this account, as well as for his living actions, you <lb/>
            should have kindly feelings towards his son. It were well <lb/>
            also, 0 Athenians, not to let it appear that we have been less <lb/>
            generous than Chians to our benefactors. For when they, <lb/>
            against whom he came with arms in hand as an enemy, have <lb/>
            not revoked any of their former honours, but regarded ancient <lb/>
            benefits as outweighing recent offences, should it appear that <lb/>
            you, for whom he perished in the attack upon them,1 instead <lb/>
            of honouring him still more on that account, have revoked <lb/>
            some of the rewards given for his former services, how can <lb/>
            you help incurring merited disgrace?</p>
          <p>For another reason too will the boy have been hardly <lb/>
            treated, if he should be robbed of his privilege: because, <lb/>
            often as Chabrias led you to battle, no man's son ever became <lb/>
            an orphan through him, while this boy has been reared in <lb/>
            orphanage through his father's zeal in your cause. Chabrias <lb/>
            was, in my view, a firm patriot indeed! for, though he was <lb/>
            reputed to be and was the safest of all generals, he exercised <lb/>
            his caution on your behalf, whenever he commanded, but <lb/>
            would not use it on his own, when he was placed himself in <lb/>
            the post of danger; and rather chose not to live than to <lb/>
            tarnish the honours which he had received from you. Should <lb/>
            we then deprive his son of that, for which he determined to <lb/>
            die or to conquer? And what shall we say, 0 Athenians, <lb/>
            when the trophies which he erected as your general stand <lb/>
            visible to all men, yet a portion of the recompense is known <lb/>
            to have been taken away? Bethink you, men of Athens, <lb/>
            and consider what is the question here. It is not the law <lb/>
            that is tried, whether it be a proper one or otherwise: you <lb/>
            are on your probation, whether or no you are fit people to <lb/>

            Look and see. It should be somewhere about there.1</p>
          <p>I wish to say another word on the subject of Chabrias. <lb/>
            You, men of Athens, in rewarding Iphicrates formerly, re­ <lb/>
            warded not only him, but Strabax and Polystratus 2 also for <lb/>
            his sake; and again, when you gave Timotheus his recom­ <lb/>
            peruse, you for his sake gave citizenship to Clearchus and <lb/>
            some others. Chabrias however was rewarded by you in his <lb/>
            own person alone. If now he had asked at the time of ob­ <lb/>
            taining his reward, that, as you had been kind to certain <lb/>
            persons for the sake of Iphicrates and Timotheus, you would <lb/>
            for his sake likewise bestow a kindness on some of these per­ <lb/>
            sons who have obtained immunity, (these for whose alleged <lb/>
            unworthiness my opponents now require you to deprive all <lb/>
            alike,) would you not have granted him this favour ?I believe <lb/>
            you would. Then will you deprive him now of his immunity <lb/>
            on account of persons to whom you would then have granted <lb/>
            a boon on his account? It would be absurd. Nor indeed <lb/>
            does it become you to appear so eager at the time of re­ <lb/>
            ceiving obligations, as to recompense not only your benefac­ <lb/>
            tors but their friends also, and yet after a brief interval to <lb/>
            take back even from the principals what you have given them.</p>

            Demosthenes here represents the clerk or usher of the court to be <lb/>
            looking about for the decree, while in the meantime he addresses him­ <lb/>
            self to a new point. This has all the appearance of being natural. <lb/>
            F. A. Wolf, who has a long note on this subject, refers to the speech on <lb/>
            the Embassy, p. 407, where the orator goes on speaking for a minute <lb/>
            or two while the witnesses are standing at the bar. And he compares <lb/>
            a passage in the Verrine oration of Cicero (IV. 3), which we know was <lb/>
            only written and never spoken: “ Canephoræ ipsæ vocabantur: sed <lb/>
            earum artificem, quern ? quemnam ? rectè admones; Polycletum esse <lb/>
            dicebant." Here the orator affects to ask some one for the name of <lb/>
            the artist, and to receive an answer, informing him that it was Poly­ <lb/>
            cletus. The effect is thus more dramatic. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Polystratus commanded the mercenary force at Corinth, in con­ <lb/>

            have a sense of the present proceeding, how just would be <lb/>
            their indignation ! For if the services which they have ren <lb/>
            dered you in deeds are to be judged of by words, and their <lb/>
            glorious actions, unless by us in speech they are gloriously <lb/>
            set forth, have been achieved by their exertions in vain, can <lb/>
            it be doubted that they are used shamefully?</p>
          <p>To show you, men of Athens, that all the arguments that <lb/>
            we address to you are meant sincerely for right and justice,2 <lb/>
            and that nothing is said by us for trickery and deceit, we <lb/>
            shall now read you the law which we have prepared and pro­ <lb/>
            pose to substitute for this one, which we say is improper. <lb/>
            You will see by it, that we make some provision, both to save <lb/>
            you from the appearance of acting dishonourably, and to <lb/>
            enable any one who has an objection to any of the privileged <lb/>
            parties, if it be well founded, to bring him before you for <lb/>
            deprivation; and further, to secure in possession of their <lb/>
            gifts those whose title no man would dispute. And in all <lb/>
            this there is nothing new or of our invention: for the ancient <lb/>
            law, which Leptines transgressed, requires that legislation <lb/>
            shall be so conducted: that whoever considers any of the <lb/>
            existing laws to be faulty may indict it, but shall himself <lb/>
            bring in another, what on repeal of the former he proposes <lb/>
            to enact, and that you shall sit in judgment and choose the <lb/>
            better law. For Solon, who prescribed this method of legis­ <lb/>

            them to be fixed up in front of the heroes,2 and to be de­ <lb/>
            livered to the secretary, and to be read by him in the assem­ <lb/>
            blies, so that you may hear them frequently and consider <lb/>
            them at leisure every one of you, and then, whatever is just <lb/>
            and expedient, you may adopt. Of these regulations, nu­ <lb/>
            merous as they are, not one did Leptines observe, or you <lb/>
            would never, I think, have been persuaded to accept the law. <lb/>
            We, 0 Athenians, have observed them all; and we introduce <lb/>
            in the place of his law one that is far better and more just, <lb/>
            as, when you hear it, you will allow. Take and read first the <lb/>
            parts of this statute which we have indicted, secondly, what <lb/>
            we say ought to be enacted. Read:</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The Law.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>These are the parts of his law which we arraign as objec­ <lb/>
            tionable. Read the following, which we say is better. Attend <lb/>
            to it while it is read, men of the jury. Read:</p>

          <p>Stop. This is found among the laws which are yet in force; <lb/>
            a plain and excellent provision, men of Athens: that what­ <lb/>
            ever grants the peoplp have made shall be valid. Heaven <lb/>
            and earth, how just! Leptines then should not have passed <lb/>
            his law before he had indicted and repealed this. Leaving <lb/>
            this statute as a testimony of his own illegal conduct, he still <lb/>
            proceeded to legislate, notwithstanding that another statute <lb/>
            makes a law indictable for this very thing, if it be contrary <lb/>
            to the previous laws. Take the law itself:</p>

            <title type="sub">[The Law.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>That all the grants made by the people shall be valid, and <lb/>
            that none shall enjoy the immunity which the people have <lb/>
            granted-is it not a contradiction, 0 Athenians? Manifestly. <note type="footnote"> 1 As to the construction of this sentence I have followed F. A. Wolf. <lb/>
            Yet I am not clear that it should not be construed thus: <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἵνα τὰ δίκαια. ᾔ <lb/>

            But not so in the law which my friend here 1 proposes to sub­ <lb/>
            stitute. By this your grants are valid, and a fair plea may <lb/>
            be urged against any persons who have imposed on you, or <lb/>
            who afterwards offend, or are generally unworthy; by means <lb/>
            of which you may prevent any one you please from retaining <lb/>
            his grant. Read the law:</p>

          <p>You hear, men of Athens, and understand: it is here pro­ <lb/>
            vided, that the deserving shall keep their gifts, and the <lb/>
            undeserving, if they get anything wrongfully, may be brought <lb/>
            to trial and deprived, and you shall have it in your power <lb/>
            for the future to grant or not to grant anything, as is just. <lb/>
            That this law is not equitable and proper, Leptines will <lb/>
            hardly assert; if he does, he will not be able to prove it; but <lb/>
            what he said before the judges, he will perhaps say to mislead <lb/>
            you. He declared, that this law had been put up against his <lb/>
            own2 for a trick, and that, if his should be repealed, this <lb/>
            would not be passed. Now the ancient law, in pursuance <lb/>
            whereof the judges placarded both for your perusal, clearly <lb/>
            provides that, if his law be repealed by your verdict, the <lb/>
            amended one shall be in force. However, I will pass that by, <lb/>
            lest there should be a contest about it ; 3 and I will go to <note type="footnote"> 1 Aphepsion. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Παραγεγράφθαι</foreign> is thus explained by Reiske : “ promulgatam, pub­ <lb/>

            which was done, that the people might more easily compare them <lb/>
            together. The commentators do not notice this error of Reiske. <lb/>
            Pabst's version however is correct: sey das Gesetz dem seinigen enge­ <lb/>
            gengestellt. And F. A. Wolf in his Prolegomena (139), referring to <lb/>
            this passage, says : " Rem ab actoribus delatam reperimus ad Thesmo- - <lb/>
            thetas, eorundemque permissu novam legem Demosthenis Leptineæ <lb/>
            in albo adscriptam, <foreign xml:lang="grc">παραγεγραμμένην</foreign>.” </note><note type="footnote"> 3 F. A. Wolf expresses his surprise, that after so positive an assertion <lb/>
            by Demosthenes, that the new statute would come into force upon that <lb/>
            of Leptines being repealed, he should intimate any apprehension of 1 <lb/>
            a contest upon the point. We, who live in a country where the uncer­ <lb/>
            tainty of the law has almost passed into a proverb, can very well <lb/>
            understand how doubts and difficulties might arise in the construction <lb/>
            of Athenian law. And in this particular case I can easily imagine what <lb/>
            Leptines might have to say upon the question. We know that an <lb/>
            Athenian citizen, who desired to pass a new law, brought it in the <lb/>
            regular manner before the Nomothetae, as explained in Vol. II. Appendix </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="35"/>
            another point. Of course, when he says this, he admits that <lb/>
            our law is better and juster than the one which he has him­ <lb/>
            self enacted: he raises a question only as to the mode of <lb/>
            passing it. First then I say-he has many remedies against <lb/>
            the party proposing the amendment, by which, if he does not <lb/>
            choose to pass his law, he may compel him. Secondly—we <lb/>
            pledge ourselves, myself, Phormio, any one he likes, to pro­ <lb/>
            ceed with the law. And you surely have a law subjecting <lb/>
            any man, who by his promise deceives the people or court or <lb/>
            council, to the severest penalties. We pledge ourselves; we <lb/>
            promise. Let the judges write down these words: let the <lb/>
            thing be on this condition. Do ye nothing unworthy of <lb/>
            yourselves: and if there be any worthless person who has got <lb/>
            the privilege, let him not retain it, but be separately tried <lb/>
            according to this law. Should he say that this is idle talk, <lb/>
            here at least is something more than talk: let him pass it <lb/>
            himself, instead of saying that we will not. Surely it is <lb/>
            more respectable to bring in a law which you have pro­ <lb/>
            nounced to be good, than this which he proposes of his own <lb/>
            manufacture.</p>
          <p>It seems to me, 0 Athenians, that Leptines (and pray don't <lb/>
            be angry, for I shall say nothing disrespectful of you,) either <lb/>
            has not read the laws of Solon, or does not understand them. <note type="footnote"> VII. If there was an existing law at variance with the one proposed, <lb/>
            the public advocates defended it, the Nomothetae considered which was <lb/>
            the better of the two, and if they decided in favour of the new one, <lb/>
            that was passed, and the other repealed. If the primary object were <lb/>
            to repeal an old law, the proceedings were still similar; for an existing <lb/>
            law could not be abrogated without a new one being introduced in its <lb/>
            place. The case however was different, where a man sought to repeal <lb/>
            a recently-enacted law on any such grounds as would have subjected <lb/>
            the proposer of it to a <foreign xml:lang="grc">γραφὴ παρανόμων</foreign>, if prosecuted within the year. <lb/>
            Then, I apprehend, it was not necessary to propose a new law in the <lb/>
            place of the one impeached, but sufficient to set up the old law which <lb/>
            that had superseded. And if the impeaching party chose at the same <lb/>
            time to bring in a law of his own, the formalities necessary to the <lb/>
            introduction of all statutes were not dispensed with: and he would have <lb/>
            to carry his law before the Nomothètæ in the regular way. There <lb/>
            would have to be a double trial, one before a jury called together by <lb/>
            the Thesmothetæ for the repeal of the law impeached; another before <lb/>
            the Nomothetæ for the passing of the new law. The present trial was <lb/>
            one of the former kind: and Leptines. might argue, that, even if the <lb/>
            jury thought proper to repeal his law, Aphepsion would still have <lb/>
            another ordeal to go through before his own law was accepted, and that <lb/>
            perhaps he would choose to drop it altogether. Compare page 498. </note> <note type="footnote"> D 2 </note> <lb/>

            For when Solon passed a law1 empowering a man to give his <lb/>
            property to whom he pleases, if he has no legitimate children, <lb/>
            not that he might deprive the nearest relatives of suc­ <lb/>
            cession, but that, by throwing the chance open to all, he might <lb/>
            excite emulation to do mutual kindnesses; but you on the <lb/>
            contrary have introduced a law forbidding the people to give <lb/>
            anything of their own to any one; how can it be said that <lb/>
            you have read the laws of Solon or understand them—you <lb/>
            that bereave the state of patriots, by announcing and de­ <lb/>
            claring that those who befriend her shall get no advantage by <lb/>
            it ? Again-this is one of the esteemed laws of Solon; that <lb/>
            no man may speak evil of the dead,2 not though he is him­ <lb/>
            self abused by the children of the dead. You don't speak <lb/>
            evil, you do evil to our deceased benefactors, finding fault <lb/>
            with one man and depreciating another, whose merits con­ <lb/>
            cerned not them. Are you not very different from Solon in <lb/>
            spirit ?</p>
          <p>A man very seriously reported to me, that, with respect to <lb/>
            the giving no reward to any one however deserving, they are <lb/>
            prepared with an argument of this kind; that neither the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians (who are well governed) nor the Thebans give <lb/>
            such honour to any of their own people, and yet there are <lb/>
            doubtless good men among them. All these, 0 Athenians, <lb/>
            are incitatives to make you abolish the immunities, but by no <lb/>
            means honest arguments, as it appears to me. For I am <lb/>
            not ignorant that the Thebans and Lacedæmonians have <lb/>
            different laws, customs, and governments from us. The very <lb/>
            thing, for example, which these men will do if they employ <lb/>
            this argument, is not lawful at Lacedeemon; to praise the <lb/>
            institutions of the Athenians or any people : far otherwise : <lb/>
            it is compulsory to praise and to do what suits the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonian government. Besides, although the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            have no such regulation as ours, there are other honours in <lb/>
            their state, the introduction of which among us would be <lb/>
            deprecated by the whole people. What are these ? I will <lb/>
            not give them in detail, but will describe one in which the <note type="footnote"> 1 See what I have written on the Attic law of inheritance under title <lb/>

            the Cato Major (c. 6): " Apud Lacedæmonios ii qui amplissimum ma­ <lb/>

            scended from Eurysthenes and Procles, united in their persons (accord­ <lb/>
            ing to the custom of the heroic age) the functions of priest and general. <lb/>
            Their office was one of honour and dignity; but their political power was <lb/>
            very limited. They presided over the council, and were the judges in <lb/>
            certain civil causes. But their highest and most important prerogative <lb/>
            was the command of the army; and they were allowed to exercise an <lb/>
            absolute authority in all military operations, especially in wars at a <lb/>
            distance from home. </note><note type="footnote"> The Council of Elders consisted of twenty-eight members, besides <lb/>
            the Kings. The office was held for life : the members were chosen for <lb/>
            some supposed merit or superior virtue by the popular assembly, and <lb/>
            were obliged to be at least sixty years of age. Their duties were chiefly <lb/>
            deliberative and judicial. They had, like the Council of Five Hundred <lb/>
            at Athens, to prepare measures to be laid before the Popular Assembly; <lb/>
            and they also held a criminal court, and exercised powers of a cen­ <lb/>
            sorial character, like the Council of Areopagus. </note><note type="footnote"> The Ephors were a college or council of five, annually elected from <lb/>
            the whole body of the people, without any qualification of age or <lb/>
            property. They were perhaps at first designed to be a check upon the <lb/>
            other authorities; but in course of time they encroached upon the pre­ <lb/>
            rogatives both of the Kings and the Council of Elders, and became the <lb/>
            paramount power in the state. We find them performing or directing <lb/>
            most of the principal acts of administration; such as convening the <lb/>
            Popular Assembly, transacting business with foreign ambassadors, sub­ <lb/>
            scribing treaties, sending out troops, giving instructions to the Kings, <lb/>
            or recalling them home. Two of the Ephors frequently accompanied <lb/>
            the army, to watch the proceedings, while the other three remained at <lb/>
            home. They exercised powers of an inquisitorial and summary charac­ <lb/>
            ter, not only over the citizens at large, but over the Kings themselves. <lb/>
            They could summon the Kings before the supreme criminal court, or <lb/>
            for minor offences bring them before their own tribunal. Thus, they <lb/>
            fined Agesilaus for trying to make himself unduly popular. They <lb/>
            imprisoned Pausanias, previously to taking measures against him for <lb/>
            his misconduct. (Thucydides, i. 131.) In short, as Muller says, they <lb/>
            became the moving element in the Spartan constitution. </note><note type="footnote"> The Popular Assembly was composed of citizens not less than thirty <lb/>
            years of age. It had nominally the power of passing laws and electing <lb/>
            priests and magistrates, determining questions of war and peace, treaties <lb/>
            with foreign states, and the like. But in all such matters it acted <lb/>
            under the check and control of the higher authorities, having the right </note><lb/>
             <pb n="38"/>
            ruler over the many. For there it is a prize of merit to <lb/>
            share the government with your peers; whereas here the <lb/>
            people govern, and there are curses 1 and laws and checks 2 to <lb/>
            prevent any one else getting the mastery, but crowns and <lb/>
            immunities and maintenance and the like to be got for being <lb/>
            virtuous. And both these customs are right enough, both <lb/>
            theirs and ours. Why ? Because oligarchal states are <lb/>
            kept in harmony by all who are at the head of affairs being <lb/>
            on an equality, whilst the freedom of democracies is preserved <lb/>
            by the competition of virtuous men for the honours of the <lb/>
            people.</p>
          <p>With respect to the Thebans not honouring any man, I <lb/>
            think I may fairly state this-The Thebans, 0 my country­ <lb/>
            men, take more pride in ferocity and iniquity than you in <lb/>
            liberality and love of justice.3 I pray, (if the prayer be law­ <lb/>
            ful,) that this distinction may never cease : that they may <lb/>
            neither praise nor recompense people who do them service ; <lb/>
            that they may treat their kindred as they have done; (you <lb/>
            know how they dealt with the Orchomenians :) and that you <lb/>
            on the contrary may reward your benefactors, and get what <lb/>
            is due from your fellow-countrymen by force of law and <lb/>
            reason.4 Generally, I think, it is time enough to praise the <lb/>
            laws and customs of other men and to censure yours, when <lb/>
            it can be shown that they are in a better condition than you. <lb/>

            any; so that, in effect, the Spartan government was an aristocracy, or <lb/>
            rather an oligarchy. On some occasions the Ephors convened a small <lb/>
            assembly, consisting only of a select class of citizens, perhaps the <lb/>

            faring better than those people, why should you despise your <lb/>
            own customs and follow theirs ? Even if theirs should appear <lb/>
            better in theory, yet, for the good fortune which you have <lb/>
            enjoyed under the existing institutions, it is well to adhere to <lb/>
            them. If on another point I may speak my mind, I would <lb/>
            say, it is not right, men of Athens, to quote laws of the <lb/>
            Thebans or the Lacedæmonians for the purpose of damaging <lb/>
            our own: it is not just that you should be ready to kill a <lb/>
            man who established among us any of the usages which make <lb/>
            them great, and yet that you should give ear to persons ad­ <lb/>
            vising the destruction of a system by which our democracy <lb/>
            prospers.</p>
          <p>They have another argument ready, namely, that in the <lb/>
            time of our ancestors we had men who, notwithstanding they <lb/>
            performed many services, never got any such reward, but were <lb/>
            content to obtain an inscription on the busts of Hermes: 1 <lb/>
            and perhaps he will read you that inscription. I believe, <lb/>
            0 Athenians, it is in many respects inexpedient for the com­ <lb/>
            monwealth to urge such an argument; and -it is unjust <lb/>
            besides. For if any one asserts that those ancients too were <note type="footnote"> 1 The Hermæ were busts or heads of the god Hermes (Mercury), <lb/>
            placed upon square blocks or pillars, generally of stone. They were <lb/>
            common in most parts of Greece, especially at Athens; and in later <lb/>
            times were used by the Romans to adorn their villas and gardens. The <lb/>
            Athenians set them at the doors or in the courts of their houses, and <lb/>
            frequently also in other places; as in porticoes, libraries, and the front <lb/>
            of temples. Some were in the gymnasia, with the names of the victors <lb/>
            inscribed upon them; others were used as sign-posts or mile-stones in <lb/>
            the highways. Hipparchus, the brother of Hippias, placed them at the <lb/>
            corners of the streets and roads, with pithy epigrams, to convey moral, <lb/>
            instruction to the people. The reverence with which they were re­ <lb/>
            garded is proved by the great excitement attending their mysterious <lb/>
            mutilation on the eve of the Sicilian expedition. (See Thucydides, vi. <lb/>
            27, 53, 60, &amp;c.) The busts referred to by Demosthenes are probably <lb/>
            those kept in the Portico called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ τῶν ῾Ερμῶν Στοά</foreign>, of which Æschines <lb/>
            makes mention in the Oration against Ctesiphon (p. 80), and the inscrip­ <lb/>
            tion the same which is there quoted, celebrating the victories of the <lb/>
            Athenians on the Strymon. Æschines says that the victors asked the <lb/>
            people for a reward, and the people gave them leave to set up three <lb/>
            Hermæ, on condition that they did not inscribe their own names upon <lb/>
            them—<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἵνα μὴ τῶν στρατηγῶν ἀλλὰ. τοῦ δήμου δοκῇ εῖναι τὸἐπίγραμμα</foreign> <lb/>
            Though there were three inscriptions, they are here spoken of as one, <lb/>
            because they relate to the same subject and occasion. See Schaefer's <lb/>

            just to argue, I will explain to you. There were many <lb/>
            estimable men in former times, 0 Athenians, and our com­ <lb/>
            monwealth honoured then also the virtuous : but the honours <lb/>

            so, I can only lament the fortune of Athens, for never having had any <lb/>
            citizens of merit. On the other hand, if he should say that the men of <lb/>
            former times deserved recompense, but got none, he brings a charge of <lb/>
            ingratitude against the country. The adversary using this argument is <lb/>

          <p>You see, men of Athens, this decree proves, that it was <lb/>
            the practice of your ancestors to reward the deserving : if not <lb/>
            with the same honours as we do, that is another affair. Ad­ <lb/>
            mitting however, that neither Lysimachus nor any one else <lb/>
            has ever had a gift from our ancestors, why should those to <lb/>
            whom we have made grants be deprived of them any the <lb/>
            more for that ? No wrong is committed by those who don't <lb/>
            give what they don't choose, but by those who give and <lb/>
            afterwards take away without a cause. If indeed it can be <lb/>
            shown, that your ancestors have taken aught away that they <lb/>
            gave to any one, I concede that you may do the same, though <lb/>
            the disgrace really is not altered : but if it cannot be shown <lb/>
            that this has at any period been done, why should the <lb/>
            example be set in our time ?</p>
          <p>You must further, 0 Athenians, bear in mind and consider, <lb/>
            that you are here sworn to give sentence according to the <lb/>

            our earliest ancestors used, but those under which the men <lb/>

            immunities—and, wherever there are no laws, to decide by <lb/>
            the principles of justice.1 Very properly. Apply then those <lb/>
            principles to the whole of the statute. Is it just, 0 Athe­ <lb/>
            nians, to honour your benefactors ? It is just. Again; is it just <lb/>
            to let a man keep what you have once given him It is just. <lb/>
            Then act so yourselves, that you may observe your oaths; <lb/>
            and if any one says that your ancestors acted otherwise, <lb/>
            resent it, and be sure that whoever cite them as examples, in­ <lb/>
            sinuating that they received great obligations and rewarded <lb/>
            no one, are base and ill-educated men: base, because they <lb/>
            falsely accuse your ancestors of ingratitude; ill-taught, be­ <lb/>
            cause they are ignorant that, if the charge were ever so true, <lb/>
            they should rather have denied than have asserted it.</p>
          <p>I believe that Leptines will urge this argument too : that <lb/>
            the law does not take statues and maintenance from parties <lb/>
            who have received them, nor from the state the power of <lb/>
            honouring worthy men; but that you will be able either to <lb/>
            erect brazen statues, or to grant maintenance or anything you <lb/>
            please, except this. In regard to what he will say he leaves <lb/>
            to the state, I must observe, that if you take away anything <lb/>
            that you have given a man before, you will render all your <lb/>
            remaining gifts insecure. For how will the grant of a <lb/>
            statue or of maintenance be more secure than the grant of <lb/>
            immunity, when it will appear you have given that to per­ <lb/>
            sons formerly and taken it away? And even if no incon­ <lb/>
            venience were to result, I don't think it would be proper <lb/>
            to put the commonwealth in this dilemma, that she must <lb/>
            give to all indiscriminately the same honours as to her <lb/>
            greatest benefactors, or, in default of so doing, make to some <lb/>
            no requital at all. For great services it is not our interest <lb/>
            that occasions should frequently arise, nor is it easy (me­ <lb/>
            thinks) to perform them :2 but for those of the middling <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Γνώμῃ τῃ̑δικαιοτάτῃ</foreign>.“ According to a fair and honest judgment- <lb/>

            I consider it both expedient and just to give a recompense. <lb/>
            Therefore should the rewards also be kept distinct, that each <lb/>
            man may receive from the people such reward as he appears <lb/>
            to deserve. In regard to what he will say he leaves to the <lb/>
            parties honoured, one class of them will have a very simple <lb/>
            and fair plea, claiming to keep all that you gave them for <lb/>
            their services; the other will say, that whoever tells them <lb/>
            they have anything left is a cheat. For a man whose services <lb/>
            were judged to have merited immunity, and who obtained <lb/>
            from you this honour alone, whether he be an alien or <lb/>
            a citizen, after he has been deprived of it, what privilege has <lb/>
            he remaining, Leptines? Surely none. Don't denounce the <lb/>
            one class as worthless in order to rob the other, and then, <lb/>
            because of what you leave to the latter, rob the former of the <lb/>
            sole thing which they have received. To speak plainly : the <lb/>
            worst is, not that we shall wrong two or three persons more <lb/>
            or less, but that we shall render the honours with which we <lb/>
            have remunerated certain people insecure: and I am most <lb/>
            urgent not for the immunity, but that the law may not in­ <lb/>
            troduce a vicious practice, and one by which every grant will <lb/>
            be insecure which the state confers.</p>
          <p>The craftiest argument which they imagine they have <lb/>

            misled. They will say, that all these charges of the choral <lb/>
            and gymnastic direction are to be classed among religious <lb/>
            duties :1 and it would be a shocking thing for any one to be <note type="footnote"> times to perform their duties to the republic, are always needed, and <lb/>

            exonerated from duties of religion. For my part, I hold it to <lb/>
            be just for persons who have a grant from the people to be <lb/>
            exempt from these charges : but what my opponents will do, <lb/>
            if they urge this argument, I regard as shocking. For if, <lb/>
            what in no other manner they can prove it lawful for you to <lb/>
            take away, they endeavour to prove1 in the name of the <lb/>
            gods, surely their conduct will be most shocking and impious. <lb/>
            It appears to me, that acts for which the gods are appealed <lb/>
            to should be such as, even if done under human sanction, <lb/>
            would not be characterised as base. That it is not the same <lb/>
            thing to have immunity from religious duties and from official <lb/>
            services, but that my opponents transfer the name of the <lb/>
            official services to the duties of religion for the purpose of <lb/>
            deceit, I will bring Leptines himself before you as a witness. <lb/>
            For in drawing up the commencement of this law he says­ <lb/>
            "Leptines moved: in order that the richest men may per­ <lb/>
            form the official services, no one shall be exempt but the <lb/>
            descendants of Harmodius and Aristogiton.” 2 Now, if it <lb/>
            were the same thing to have exemption from religious duties <lb/>
            and from official services, what did he mean by adding that <lb/>
            clause? for not even to those men is exemption from religious <lb/>
            duties granted. To prove that it is as I say, please to take <lb/>
            first the copy of the pillar, then the commencement of the <lb/>
            law of Leptines. Read:</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The copy of the Pillar.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>You hear the copy of the pillar, men of Athens, ordering <lb/>
            them to be exempt, save from religious duties. Now read <lb/>
            the commencement of the law of Leptines:</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The Law.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Good. Put it down. After the words, “ in order that the <lb/>
            richest men may perform the official services, no one shall be <lb/>
            exempt," he added, “ but the descendants of Harmodius and <lb/>
            Aristogiton." With what object, if to do religious duty is to <lb/>
            perform official service ? 3 For, if he use this argument, it <figure type="illustration">

              will appear that he has himself framed a clause contrary to <lb/>
              the pillar. And I would fain ask Leptines a question-From <lb/>
              what can you say that either you leave or our ancestors <lb/>
              granted them immunity, when you say the official services <lb/>
              appertain to religion ? To all the war-taxes and the naval <lb/>
              charges by the ancient laws they remain liable; and from <lb/>
              the official services, if they appertain to religion, they have <lb/>
              no exemption. It is written however, that they shall be <lb/>
              exempt. From what ? From the aliens' protection-tax ? for <lb/>
              this is left. Surely not; but from the ordinary official ser­ <lb/>
              vices, as the pillar declares, as you have defined it in your <lb/>
              law, as is proved by a length of bygone time, during all <lb/>
              which no tribe ever ventured to nominate one of their family <lb/>
              to be choir-master, no other nominee to offer them the ex­ <lb/>
              change. Should he venture to contradict this, you must not <lb/>
              listen to him.</p>
          <p>Again, they will tell you perhaps in an off-hand way,1 that <lb/>
            some persons, pretending to be Megarians and Messenians,2 <note type="footnote"> 1 Reiske thus interprets <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπισιύρειν</foreign>: “ festinanter, temere, tumultuarie <lb/>

            to us. It would seem however, that the Athenians had passed some <lb/>
            decree in favour of the Megarians and Messenians, perhaps giving them <lb/>
            exemption from certain duties. The Megarians had become friendly to <lb/>
            Athens since the Peloponnesian war. They received some of the exiles <lb/>
            during the tyranny of the Thirty. (Xenophon, Hellen. ii. c. 4, s. 1.) <lb/>
            They assisted the Athenians in their contest with Philip, who attempted <lb/>
            in vain to get Megara into his power. (See VoL II. pp. 325, 382.) The <lb/>
            Messenians of Naupactus had always been closely connected with the <lb/>
            Athenians, to whom they owed their foundation (see Thucydides, i. <lb/>
            103); and friendship was established between Athens and the new state <lb/>
            of Messene after the battle of Mantinea. Leptines would perhaps con­ <lb/>
            tend, that the grant of exemption occasioned loss and inconvenience, <lb/>
            because many foreigners laid claim to it under false pretences, and it <lb/>
            was difficult to distinguish who were lawfully entitled. </note><note type="footnote"> Pabst, following Schaefer, gives a different interpretation to the <lb/>

            get exemption in a body, a great multitude of people, and <lb/>
            some too that are slaves and stigmatics, a Lycidas, a Diony­ <lb/>
            sius, and others of the like stamp, whom they have selected. <lb/>
            If they make such assertions, deal with them in the following <lb/>
            way.-Require them, if they are telling you the truth, to <lb/>
            produce the decrees by which these persons are exempt; for <lb/>
            no man among you is exempt, unless a decree or a law has <lb/>
            granted him exemption. Many of this character have by the <lb/>
            influence of your politicians become state-friends here; of <lb/>
            whom Lycidas is one. But it is a different thing to be a <lb/>
            state-friend and to have obtained immunity. Then don't let <lb/>
            them mislead you: don't, because Lycidas and Dionysius <lb/>
            and perhaps some other slaves (thanks to people who are <lb/>
            ready to frame such decrees for hire) have been made state- <lb/>
            friends,—don't on this account seek to rob men, who are <lb/>
            meritorious and free-born and the authors of numerous <lb/>
            benefits, of the rewards which they justly received from you. <lb/>
            Here again will be a flagrant indignity offered to Chabrias, if <lb/>
            politicians of this class are not content with having made <lb/>
            his slave Lycidas your state-friend, but will on that person's <lb/>
            account take away a portion of his rewards, and on a false <lb/>
            allegation too! For neither Lycidas nor any one else, to <lb/>
            whom the people have not expressly granted exemption, <lb/>
            enjoys it by being a state-friend. To these men the people <lb/>
            have made no grant: my adversaries will not be able to show <lb/>
            it; and if they are impudent enough to make the assertion, <lb/>
            they will not be acting right.</p>
          <p>What of all things I consider you should especially guard <lb/>
            against, men of Athens, I have yet to mention. Granting <lb/>
            all to be true that Leptines, arguing in its favour, will say <lb/>
            about the law, one disgrace which, by the law being esta­ <lb/>
            blished, will fall upon the state, can under no circumstances <lb/>
            be removed. What is this ? The reputation of having de­ <lb/>
            ceived her benefactors. That this is a disgraceful thing, will <lb/>
            be admitted, I suppose, by all: how much more disgraceful <lb/>
            it is to you than to others, allow me to explain. You have <lb/>
            an ancient law, one of those in good esteem, that, if any man <lb/>
            deceives the people by a promise, he shall be brought to <lb/>
            trial, and on conviction sentenced to death. Are you not <lb/>
            then ashamed, 0 Athenians, at the thought of being known <lb/>
            to do yourselves what in others you make punishable with <lb/>
             <pb n="47"/>
            death? One should avoid doing everything which appears <lb/>
            and is dishonourable, but especially that for which one is <lb/>
            seen to be severe to others: 1 for not a doubt remains that <lb/>
            it is wrong to do what a man himself has previously <lb/>
            condemned.</p>
          <p>You must further take care not to be seen doing in your <lb/>
            public character aught that you would avoid doing in your <lb/>
            private. Not one of you would take away anything which <lb/>
            he gave to another in private; no, nor attempt such a thing. <lb/>
            Do it not then in public; but require these men who are to <lb/>
            defend the law, if they allege that any of the privileged <lb/>
            parties is undeserving, or has not performed the conditions <lb/>
            upon which he obtained his privilege, -or if they have any <lb/>
            other complaint against any one, to indict him according to <lb/>
            the amended law that we introduce, whether we pass it, as we <lb/>
            pledge ourselves and declare we will, or whether they pass <lb/>
            it themselves, as soon as law-revisors are appointed. Each of <lb/>
            them, it seems, has an enemy, either Diophantus or Eubulus <lb/>
            or some one else. If they decline, if they are unwilling to <lb/>
            take this course, consider, men of Athens, whether it is to <lb/>
            your credit, that you should be known to have taken away <lb/>
            from your benefactors what none of these men like to be seen <lb/>
            taking from their enemies, and that persons who have served <lb/>
            you, and against whom none can bring a charge, should by a <lb/>
            law of your passing be deprived all together of their rewards, <lb/>
            when, if there be any undeserving, perchance one or two or <lb/>
            more, they might, upon an indictment preferred by these <lb/>
            men, be separately brought to trial and suffer the like depri­ <lb/>
            vation. I scarcely think it would be to your credit or suitable <lb/>
            to your dignity.</p>
          <p>Nor must we abandon this point, that the question of merit <lb/>
            should be discussed at the time of the grant, when none of <lb/>
            these men made opposition, but afterwards you should leave <lb/>
            it alone, unless you have since been injured by the grantees. <lb/>
            Should these men say that you have been, (prove it they <note type="footnote"> 1 Compare Shakspeare, Measure for Measure, Act V.:— <lb/>
            It imports no reason <lb/>
            That with such vehemency he should pursue <lb/>

            He would have weigh'd thy brother by himself, <lb/>
            And not have cut him off. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="48"/>
            cannot,) it should appear that they were punished at the time <lb/>
            of their offence. Should you confirm the law without any <lb/>
            such ground, you will be thought to have deprived the parties <lb/>
            from envy, and not from a discovery of their bad character. <lb/>
            Every possible reproach (I may say) should be avoided; but <lb/>
            this most of all, 0 Athenians. Why ? Because envy is alto­ <lb/>
            gether a mark of a bad disposition, and a man who has the <lb/>
            feeling is pardonable on no account. Besides, abhorring as <lb/>
            our commonwealth does all disgraceful things, there is no <lb/>
            reproach from which she is further removed, than from the <lb/>
            imputation of being envious. Observe how strong are the <lb/>
            proofs. In the first place, you are the only people who have <lb/>
            state funerals for the dead, and funeral orations in which you <lb/>
            glorify the actions of brave men.1 Such a custom is that of <lb/>
            people admiring virtue, not envying others who are honoured <lb/>
            for it.2 In the next place, you have ever bestowed the <lb/>
            highest rewards upon those who win the garland in gym­ <lb/>
            nastic contests ;3 nor have you, because but few are born to <lb/>
            partake of such rewards, envied the parties receiving them, <lb/>
            nor abridged your honours on that account. Add to these <lb/>
            striking evidences, that no one appears ever to have surpassed <lb/>
            our state in liberality: such munificence has she displayed in <lb/>
            requiting services. All these, men of Athens, are manifesta­ <lb/>
            tions of justice, virtue, magnanimity. Do not now destroy <lb/>
            the character for which our state has all along been renowned: <lb/>
            do not, in order that Leptines may wreak his personal malice <lb/>
            upon some men whom he dislikes, deprive the state and your­ <lb/>
            selves of the honourable name which you have enjoyed <note type="footnote"> 1 These public funerals took place in the Ceramicus, without the <lb/>
            walls. There are four funeral orations extant: those of Pericles, in <lb/>
            Thucydides; of Plato, in the Menexenus; of Lysias, and of Demo­ <lb/>

              throughout all time: regard this as a contest purely for the <lb/>
              dignity of Athens, whether it is to be maintained the same as <lb/>
              before, or to be impaired and degraded.</p>
          <p>Wondering at many parts of Leptines' conduct in regard to <lb/>
            the law, I wonder at this most: whether he is ignorant, that, <lb/>
            as a person who made the penalties of crime severe, would be <lb/>
            thought himself to have no intention of committing crime, so <lb/>
            a man, who abolishes the rewards of merit, will be thought to <lb/>
            have no intention himself of rendering service. Whether he <lb/>
            was ignorant of this, (which is possible,) he will show pre­ <lb/>
            sently : for he will allow you to rescind an act, the passing of <lb/>
            which was an error on his own part. If I find him seriously <lb/>
            exerting himself to confirm the law, I can hardly commend, <lb/>
            though I am loth to censure him. Do not then be obstinate, <lb/>
            Leptines; do not press for a measure, by which neither your­ <lb/>
            self nor those that hearken to you will gain in reputation; <lb/>
            especially since the contest is no longer hazardous to you. <lb/>
            For by the death of Bathippus, the father of my friend <lb/>
            Aphepsion, who indicted him while he was yet responsible, <lb/>
            the time has elapsed, and now the whole question is about <lb/>
            the law itself, and Leptines is in no danger.</p>
          <p>I hear, you say this too-that three persons have indicted <lb/>
            you before my friend here, and not followed it up. If you <lb/>
            mean to complain against them for not putting you in jeopardy, <lb/>
            you are the most adventurous of mankind: if you take it as <lb/>
            proof of the justice of your case, you act very foolishly. For <lb/>
            how is the law any better, because one of your prosecutors <lb/>
            has died before trying the indictment, or dropped it at your <lb/>
            persuasion, or was altogether put up by you? Such argu­ <lb/>
            ments it is not proper even to suggest.</p>
          <p>Advocates have been chosen to defend the law, no less <lb/>
            persons than those able speakers Leodamas 1 of Acharnæ, <lb/>
            Aristophon of Azenia, Cephisodotus of Ceramicus, and Dinias <lb/>
            of Erchea. Now let me show how you may fairly stop their <lb/>
            mouths, and see if you think it just. First for Leodamas. <lb/>
            He indicted the grant to Chabrias, in which among other <lb/>
            things given to him is this privilege of immunity, and <note type="footnote"> 1 Eschines (Contr. Ctesiph. 73) says of Leodamas, that he was as good <lb/>
            a speaker as Demosthenes. As to Aristophon, see Vol. II. Appendix II. <lb/>
            And for further information about the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Σύνδικοι</foreign>, see that title in the <lb/>
            Archaeological Dictionary. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. III. </note> <note type="footnote"> E </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="50"/>
            appearing in court he was beaten: but the laws do not allow <lb/>
            the same point to be twice contested with the same party, either <lb/>
            in actions or audits or interpleaderl or anything of the <lb/>
            kind. Besides, it would be a gross absurdity, if on that occa­ <lb/>
            sion the deeds of Chabrias had more influence with you than <lb/>
            the words of Leodamas; yet, when you have those deeds and <lb/>
            the deeds of your other benefactors added to them, they should <lb/>
            altogether be weaker than the words of this man. Against <lb/>
            Aristophon I think I have many pleas to urge. He obtained <lb/>
            his grant by your decree; comprising immunity. Of this I <lb/>
            don't complain; for you should have the power to bestow your <lb/>
            own upon whom you please: but it is not right, I say, that, <lb/>
            when he was about to receive this boon, he should see no harm <lb/>
            in it, yet, when it has been given to others, he should be angry <lb/>
            and advise you to take it away. Further; he has moved the <lb/>
            repaying of five talents to Gelarchus, on the ground that he <lb/>
            gave that sum to the people in Piræus: 2 and he did right. <lb/>
            But, Aristophon—do not let money for which there are no <lb/>
            vouchers be paid at your request under pretext of the people's <lb/>
            good, while you advise us to take away gifts of which the <lb/>
            people themselves have set up memorials in the temples, and <lb/>
            which are notorious to all men. Do not at the same time be <lb/>
            seen moving decrees for the payment of debts, and advising <lb/>
            to take away what has been obtained from the people. To <lb/>
            Cephisodotus I have this much to say. He, men of Athens, <lb/>
            is inferior to none of our speakers in eloquence. It is far <lb/>
            better then to employ that eloquence for the punishment of <lb/>
            those who wrong you, than for the wronging of those who <lb/>
            have done you service. If one is to quarrel with any persons, <lb/>
            it should rather be, as I conceive, with those who wrong than <lb/>
            with those who serve the people. Now for Dinias. He will <lb/>
            talk perhaps of his trierarchies and public burdens:3 to <lb/>
            which my answer is-If Dinias has proved himself a valuable <lb/>
            citizen, as most assuredly I believe he has, I would rather <lb/>
            advise him to demand some recompense from you, than to <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Διαδικασία</foreign> was a technical term for that process in Athenian law, <lb/>
            by which different parties contested their claims to an inheritance. It <lb/>

            bid you take away the rewards formerly given to others. It <lb/>
            argues a far better man to demand honour for his own ser­ <lb/>
            vices, than to envy those for which other men were honoured.1 <lb/>
            But the strongest objection, which applies to all the advocates, <lb/>
            I am now coming to. Each of them has been an advocate in <lb/>
            divers cases before. You have a law however, and a very <lb/>
            proper one, (not passed against these men, but to prevent the <lb/>
            thing becoming a sort of trade and job2 for certain indi­ <lb/>
            viduals,) that it shall be not lawful to act as an advocate by <lb/>
            the people's appointment more than once. Men who are to <lb/>
            support a law and prove to you its fitness should be seen them­ <lb/>
            selves to obey the existing laws: it would be ridiculous, if <lb/>
            they defended one law and in their own persons violated an­ <lb/>
            other. Take and read them the law which I refer to :</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The Law.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>This law, men of Athens, is both an ancient and a proper <lb/>
            one; and if they are wise, they will be careful not to break it.</p>
          <p>A few more words and I shall sit down. I consider, 0 <lb/>
            Athenians, you should be anxious to have all your laws as <lb/>
            good as possible, but especially those on which it turns <lb/>
            whether the commonwealth be little or great. Which be <lb/>
            they? Those which award honour to men that serve you, <lb/>
            and punishment to men of the opposite class. For if all <lb/>
            truly fearing the penalties of the laws would abstain from evil <lb/>
            courses, and all competing for the rewards of good service <lb/>
            would determine to do their duty, what prevents the common­ <lb/>
            wealth being mighty, and all being honest men without a bad <lb/>
            one among us?</p>
          <p>This law of Leptines is unrighteous, 0 Athenians, not only <note type="footnote"> 1 Literally : " than to envy the deeds which others were honoured <lb/>

            because, by doing away with the rewards of merit, it takes <lb/>
            from those who are zealous to serve you all the fruits of their <lb/>
            goodwill, but because it bequeaths to the commonwealth the <lb/>
            grave reproach of transgressing law. You are of course <lb/>
            aware, that our greatest criminals have each but one penalty <lb/>
            by the law, which expressly declares " And let there not be <lb/>
            more than one penalty upon a trial; whichever the court like <lb/>
            to impose, a corporal or a pecuniary one; 1 but both shall <lb/>
            not be allowed." Leptines did not observe this rule : but, if <lb/>
            any man demand requital of you, " let him be disfranchised,” <lb/>
            he says : “ and let his property be confiscated." Two penal­ <lb/>
            ties these. "And he may be proceeded against by information. <lb/>
            and imprisonment: 2 and if he be convicted, let him be <lb/>
            amenable to the law, which lies where a man holds office <lb/>
            being indebted 3 to the state." He means death; for that is <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Παθει̑ν</foreign> was the term strictly applied to corporal punishment; <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀτιμία</foreign>, or disfranchisement, however the debt was contracted. Thus,. <lb/>
            if a magistrate, who had received any of the public monies, had not <lb/>
            accounted for them; or if a lessee of public property did not pay the <lb/>
            rents when they became due; or if a man sentenced to pay a fine did <lb/>
            not pay it immediately; he was ipso facto disfranchised, and so forbid­ <lb/>
            den to exorcise any of his civil rights until the debt was paid. If he <lb/>
            died in debt, the misfortune extended to his children. But he or they <lb/>
            might at any time relieve themselves by settling the account with the <lb/>
            state: for the object was not so much to punish the debtor, as to en­ <lb/>
            force the collection of public money. Cimon, the son of Miltiades, <lb/>
            before he could engage in political affairs or assume the rank of a <lb/>
            citizen, was compelled to pay a fine of fifty talents, which had been <lb/>
            imposed on his father: and it is said that the money was advanced by <lb/>
            Callias, in return for the hand of his sister Elpinice. </note><note type="footnote"> Besides this indirect method of enforcing payment of the public <lb/>
            debts, the law of Athens provided other stringent means for the same­ <lb/>
            purpose. The names of all debtors were returned to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πράκτορες</foreign>, or <lb/>
            Collectors of the Treasury, whose duty it was to demand the money <lb/>
            and pay it over to the '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αποδέκται</foreign>, or Receivers, and also to return to <lb/>
            them the names of all defaulters. A registry of these was kept by the <lb/>
            '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αποδέκταιι</foreign>n the '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Οπισθόδομος</foreign>, the interior cell of the Parthenon, which <lb/>
            was used for the state treasury. If the debtor did not pay before the <lb/>
            end of the ninth Prytany, that is, before the expiration of forty-five <lb/>
            weeks, his debt was doubled, and proceedings were taken to levy it by <lb/>
            sale of his property. Special inquisitors, called Z<foreign xml:lang="grc">ητηταὶ</foreign>, were some­ </note> <lb/>

            the penalty for such an offence. Here then are three penalties. <lb/>
            Is it not cruel and shocking, men of Athens, that it should <lb/>
            appear to be a graver offence with you to demand requital <lb/>
            for services, than to be found guilty of the most heinous <lb/>
            crimes ?</p>
          <p>Disgraceful is the law, 0 Athenians, and vicious in cha­ <lb/>
            racter, and like a sort of envy and jealousy. And I pass by <lb/>
            the rest. The author himself appears to indulge some such <lb/>
            feelings : but it does not become you to imitate anything <lb/>
            of the kind, or appear to hold sentiments unworthy of your­ <lb/>
            selves. In the name of Jupiter, let me ask—What should <lb/>
            we pray most to be delivered from ? What have all laws <lb/>
            been most anxious to prevent ? The committing of murder: <lb/>
            of which the Council of Areopagus is appointed to have <lb/>
            special cognisance. 1 Now in the laws upon this subject <lb/>
            Draco, although he strove to make it fearful and dreadful for <lb/>
            one man to slay another, and ordained that the homicide <lb/>
            should be excluded 2 from lustrations, cups, and drink-offer­ <lb/>
            ings, from the temples and the market-place, specifying <lb/>
            everything by which he thought most effectually to restrain <lb/>
            people from such a practice, still did not abolish the rule of <note type="footnote"> times appointed to discover what property the debtor had. But in <lb/>
            general this was done by an Informer, who delivered an inventory of <lb/>
            the debtor s effects to the council, and received for his reward three­ <lb/>
            fourths of their value. The council handed over the inventory to the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πωλη̑ται</foreign>, who sold the property therein specified by auction, or so <lb/>
            much thereof as was required to satisfy the debt. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Wilful murder was tried by the Areopagus. Other cases of <lb/>
            homicide were by the laws of Draco assigned to the jurisdiction of the <lb/>
            Ephetæ. See Article <foreign xml:lang="grc">φόνος</foreign>, written by me in the Archaeological <lb/>
            Dictionary. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 A notice to the murderer to keep away from all public places and <lb/>
            sacrifices was usually given by the prosecutor at the funeral of the <lb/>
            deceased, and a similar warning was afterwards given by the King- <lb/>
            Archon, when the charge had been preferred before him. We must <lb/>
            understand that murder was considered at Athens not only a crime, <lb/>
            but a pollution in a religious point of view, from the contagion of <lb/>
            which it was necessary to keep the people free. Hence it was that <lb/>
            the trial of the offence took place in the open air. The pollution ex­ <lb/>
            tended even to cases of unintentional homicide, that were not wholly <lb/>
            excusable; and was supposed to continue, until the manslayer had ex­ <lb/>
            piated it by the proper ceremonies. (See Æschylus, Eumenides, 228, <lb/>
            423, &amp;c.) Justifiable homicide however left the party who committed <lb/>
            it wholly pure. The denunciation of the murderer of Laius, put in </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="54"/>
            justice,1 but laid down the cases in which it should be lawful <lb/>
            to kill, and declared that the killer under such circumstances <lb/>
            should be deemed pure. Then shall it be allowed to commit <lb/>
            justifiable homicide under your laws, but not to demand <lb/>
            recompense either justly or anyhow by the law of Leptines? <lb/>
            Never consent to this, men of Athens ! Do not let it appear <lb/>
            that you have taken more pains to prohibit your benefactors <lb/>
            from obtaining requital, than to prevent murder being com­ <lb/>
            mitted in the city: but remembering the occasions on which <lb/>
            you have requited the objects of your bounty, and the pillar <lb/>
            of Demophantus,2 of which Phormio spoke, in which it is <lb/>

              years, until B. c. 406, when, owing partly to their intestine discords, and <lb/>
              partly to their fear of the Carthaginians, Dionysius, the son of Hermo­ <lb/>
              crates, was appointed to the chief military command, by means of which <lb/>
              he raised himself to the throne, and reigned thirty-eight years. He was <lb/>
              originally a scribe, or secretary, in a public office, though his parentage <lb/>
              was honourable. (Diodorus, xin. 96. Polyænus, v. 2. Cicero, Tuscul. <lb/>
              Quæst. v. 20.) His son, who succeeded him, but was inferior to him in <lb/>
              every respect, was expelled by Dion, B. c. 356, afterwards regained his <lb/>
              power, and was finally expelled, B.C. 343, by Timoleon, who restored <lb/>
              liberty to the Sicilian states. These events are fully related by Dio­ <lb/>
              dorus in his history, and by Plutarch in the lives of Dion and Timoleon. <lb/>
              It is not true that the Syracusana ever received tribute from the Car. <lb/>

              that you may comprehend the whole question at once, and <lb/>
              that I may have done speaking, do what I now advise. Make <lb/>
              your comparison; consider what will happen to you if you <lb/>
              condemn the law, and what if you do not; then keep in <lb/>
              mind what you think will be the consequence in either event, <lb/>
              that you may choose the better course. If now you condemn <lb/>
              the law, as we advise, the deserving will have their rights <lb/>
              from you, and if there be any undeserving party, as I grant <lb/>
              there may be, such a one, besides being deprived of his <lb/>

              to the amended statute, while the commonwealth will appear <lb/>
              faithful, just, true to all men. Should you decide in its <lb/>
              favour, which I trust you will not, the good will be wronged <lb/>
              on account of the bad, the undeserving will be the cause of <lb/>
              misfortune to others, and suffer no punishment themselves, <lb/>
              while the commonwealth (contrary to what I said just now) <lb/>
              will be universally esteemed faithless, envious, base. It is <lb/>
              not meet, 0 Athenians, that for so foul a reproach you should <lb/>
              reject fair and honourable advantages. Remember, each of <lb/>
              you individually will share in the reputation of your common <lb/>
              judgment. It is plain to the bystanders and to all men, <lb/>
              that in the court Leptines is contending with us, but in the <lb/>
              mind of each of you jurymen generosity is arrayed against <lb/>
              envy, justice against iniquity, all that is virtuous against all <lb/>
              that is base.1 If you follow the wiser counsels, and give <lb/>
              judgment in my favour, you will yourselves have the credit <lb/>
              of a proper decision, and will have voted what is best for the <lb/>

            <title type="sub">THE ARGUMENT.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THE cause of this proceeding against Midias was an assault committed <lb/>
            on Demosthenes with aggravating circumstances at the Dionysian <lb/>
            festival. Demosthenes was Choragus: he had volunteered to take <lb/>
            the office, which his tribe (the Pandionian) had not provided any <lb/>
            one to fill for two years. In the drawing of lots he got the choice <lb/>
            of the best flute-player; and his liberal conduct having been received <lb/>
            with much applause by the people, he resolved to exhibit his chorus <lb/>
            with becoming splendour, and accordingly he ordered golden crowns <lb/>
            and handsome dresses to be prepared for them. Midias, a man of <lb/>
            wealth, and an enemy of Demosthenes, with whom he had a quarrel <lb/>
            of some standing, vexed to see him acquiring so much credit with <lb/>
            the public, insulted and annoyed him in divers ways during the <lb/>
            festival, and at last struck him with his fist upon the stage and tore <lb/>
            his official dress. For this, on a day specially appointed after the <lb/>
            festival for the hearing of such complaints, Demosthenes preferred <lb/>
            a charge against Midias before the popular assembly, and procured <lb/>
            a vote directing him to be criminally prosecuted. This vote was a <lb/>
            sort of true bill found against Midias by the people, affording strong <lb/>
            presumptive evidence of his guilt, but yet not conclusive; for the <lb/>
            whole question was still to be dealt with by the judicial tribunal to <lb/>
            which it was referred. The proceeding itself in the technical lan­ <lb/>
            guage of Athenian law was called Probole: of which some account <lb/>
            will be given in Appendix VIII.</p>
          <p>Whether the case was ever brought to trial before a jury, is a question <lb/>
            not free from doubt. Dionysius, assigning the date of the oration, <lb/>
            speaks of it as written only Æschines, in the oration against <lb/>
            Ctesiphon, reproaches his rival with having compromised the affair <lb/>
            for thirty minas : nor does Demosthenes contradict him. Plutarch, <lb/>
            in his life of Demosthenes, assumes the fact as undoubted, and con­ <lb/>
            tends that he settled the dispute not from any wish to spare the <lb/>
            defendant, for he was of an unforgiving disposition; not from avarice, <lb/>
            for the sum given was too small; but under the apprehension that <lb/>
            Midias by his wealth and influence would be too strong for him. <lb/>
            Modern writers have generally acquiesced in the view of Plutarch. <lb/>
            If it be the true one, we must suppose that it was not forbidden by <lb/>
            the Athenian law to accept compensation, and that this was not one <lb/>
            of the cases in which the dropping of a prosecution was attended <lb/>
            with disfranohisement. (See the Oration, page 548, Orig.) It would <lb/>
            appear indeed somewhat strange, if Demosthenes afterwards published <lb/>
            a speech, in which he not only exhibits vindictive feelings towards <lb/>
             <pb n="60"/>
            his opponent, but takes credit to himself for having rejected all <lb/>
            offers of compromise and having brought the defendant to trial as <lb/>
            a public offender. There are some grounds however, furnished by <lb/>
            the oration itself, for believing that it never was published by Demo­ <lb/>
            ethenes, but left by him in an unfinished state. Photius refers to <lb/>
            certain critics who were of that opinion. Grote in his history <lb/>
            represents that the trial actually took place; that Demosthenes <lb/>
            delivered his speech and obtained the verdict of the jury in his <lb/>
            favour; but that, before they proceeded to find their second verdict <lb/>
            for the penalty, he accepted the moderate fine offered by the de­ <lb/>
            fendant, for fear of exasperating the powerful body of friends who <lb/>
            came to intercede for him. If this account of the matter were re­ <lb/>
            concilable with the ancient authorities, (which it can hardly be <lb/>
            thought to be however,) one would be glad to adopt it, as it would <lb/>
            altogether clear Demosthenes from the charge of having hushed up <lb/>
            so gross an affront for a paltry sum of money. A. G. Becker suggests <lb/>
            that there were legal doubts as to the character of the offence— <lb/>
            whether it were one of a public or a private nature-and therefore <lb/>
            Demosthenes, feeling that his ground was not sure, had an additional <lb/>
            motive for accepting the terms offered by his opponent.</p>
          <p>The speech before us, whether actually delivered or only intended to <lb/>
            have been delivered, is acknowledged to be the genuine production <lb/>
            of Demosthenes; and is a pretty good specimen of forensic elo­ <lb/>
            quence. According to our notions indeed, it is somewhat too <lb/>
            rambling and discursive: for the orator not only goes into a long <lb/>
            history of wrongs done to him by Midias, independent of that which <lb/>
            formed the subject of prosecution, (a course to some extent justifi­ <lb/>
            able, as tending to prove malicious motives on the part of the de­ <lb/>
            fendant,) but charges him with injuries done to other men, attacks <lb/>
            his general character and the conduct of his whole life. We must <lb/>
            bear in mind however, that a very loose practice, both in the speak­ <lb/>
            ing and the evidence, was permitted by the Athenian courts.</p>
          <p>The principal object of the speech is to excite the feelings of the jury <lb/>
            against Midias, with a view to increase the measure of his punish­ <lb/>
            ment. It was notorious that the assault had been committed. The <lb/>
            people who condemned Midias in the assembly had been eye-witnesses <lb/>
            of what he had done in the theatre. Demosthenes therefore had no <lb/>
            difficulty to prove the main subject of the charge : he labours chiefly <lb/>
            to show the malignant purpose of the defendant, and that, in striving <lb/>
            to wreak his malice upon a personal enemy, he had committed a <lb/>
            crime against the state and her religion. To make this out, he enters <lb/>
            minutely into all the circumstances of the case; his own offer to <lb/>
            undertake the duties of Choragus, his favourable reception by the <lb/>
            people, his preparations for the spectacle: how Midias had imme­ <lb/>
            diately commenced a system of insult and annoyance, which he <lb/>
            continued throughout the whole time of the festival, until he perpe­ <lb/>
            trated the final outrage by striking him before the assembled spec­ <lb/>
            tators. He (Demosthenes) had sought redress in the manner specially <lb/>
            provided for such a case by the Athenian law: he had arraigned <lb/>
            Midias before the people, considering the offence to be one which <lb/>
            merited a public prosecution. It was not a case of one private in­ <lb/>
             <pb n="61"/>
            dividual insulted by another, but of a Choragus, a public officer, <lb/>
            whose duties at the festival invested him with a sacred character. <lb/>
            He shows by precedents what importance the Athenians attached to <lb/>
            the office. To strike such a man while in the performance of his <lb/>
            duties, and to tear his official robe, argued a contempt of the com­ <lb/>
            monwealth and her institutions. The festival was a holiday, during <lb/>
            which the law forbade the execution even of legal process. If acts <lb/>
            otherwise lawful might not be committed at this time, how un­ <lb/>
            pardonable was it to commit an act altogether unlawful. Midias <lb/>
            had no manner of excuse. He had received no provocation : he was <lb/>
            neither drunk nor in a passion when he struck the blow. That it <lb/>
            was an act of premeditated malice was clear from his previous con­ <lb/>
            duct ; in particular, from his base attempt to destroy the dresses and <lb/>
            crowns which had been sent to the goldsmith, from his blocking up <lb/>
            the side entrance to the stage, from his enticing away the training- <lb/>
            master of the chorus, from his bribing the umpires, which had <lb/>
            caused the Pandionian tribe to lose the prize. Midias had been at <lb/>
            enmity with Demosthenes for many years. The quarrel had arisen <lb/>
            out of the proceedings of Demosthenes against his guardians, which <lb/>
            Midias had attempted to defeat by forcing upon him an exchange of <lb/>
            estates with his brother Thrasvlochus. The two brothers had rushed <lb/>
            into his house, broken the doors, and behaved with brutal inso­ <lb/>
            lence, uttering the most indecent language in the presence of his <lb/>
            sister, a young girl. For this Demosthenes brought an action against <lb/>
            Midias, and recovered damages, of which down to the present time <lb/>
            he had never been able to obtain payment. Meanwhile the defendant <lb/>
            had never ceased to persecute him in every possible way. Among <lb/>
            other things, he had hired a low fellow named Euctemon to prefer an <lb/>
            indictment against Demosthenes for desertion of his post, which <lb/>
            Euctemon had not ventured to bring to trial, and having failed to <lb/>
            prosecute, had suffered the penalty of disfranchisement. But a yet <lb/>
            more dreadful plot had been laid for his ruin. A murder had been <lb/>
            committed by one Aristarchus, against whom the relatives of the <lb/>
            deceased were taking legal proceedings. Midias offered them money <lb/>
            to drop their proceedings against Aristarchus and to accuse Demo­ <lb/>
            sthenes of the crime. Two of the relations, to whom the money <lb/>
            was offered, are called to give their testimony. It was evident from <lb/>
            this that Midias would use any means, however nefarious, to be <lb/>
            revenged on people who offended him. He had by a base trick pro­ <lb/>
            cured the disfranchisement of Straton the arbitrator, for no other <lb/>
            reason than because he had pronounced his award against him and <lb/>
            in favour of Demosthenes. Witnesses are called to prove this; and <lb/>
            Straton himself, who being disfranchised was incapable of giving <lb/>
            testimony, is produced before the jury to excite their indignation <lb/>
            against the defendant for his cruel treatment. There were a. multi­ <lb/>
            tude of other people in Athens who had suffered grievous wrongs <lb/>
            from the defendant. A catalogue of these is read to the court, un­ <lb/>
            accompanied (as it seems) by any proof. The great body of those <lb/>
            whom he had injured had not dared to complain : the few that had <lb/>
            complained were not able to obtain redress. The wealth and power <lb/>
            of Midias encouraged him to set the laws at defiance. He had a <lb/>
             <pb n="62"/>
            band of confederates ready to back him in every act of fraud and <lb/>
            oppression. By bribing some people, by intimidating others, by an <lb/>
            unscrupulous use of the trickeries of pleading and every kind of <lb/>
            legal artifice, he had hitherto contrived to escape from justice. The <lb/>
            jury had now an opportunity of punishing him for all his misdeeds <lb/>
            at once; and they should not let it slip out of their hands. It was <lb/>
            dangerous to leave such a man in possession of wealth, which he used <lb/>
            only as an instrument for mischief. Midias, besides being oppressive <lb/>
            to all men, had rendered himself universally odious by his over­ <lb/>
            bearing insolence This now, owing to the licence which he had so <lb/>
            -ong enjoyed, exceeded all bounds. He had the vices of Alcibiades <lb/>
            without his courage and abilities. Alcibiades, on account of his mad <lb/>
            pranks, intolerable in a free state, had been exiled from Athens, not­ <lb/>
            withstanding the services that he had rendered her. But Midias had <lb/>
            never done any service whatsoever to his country. He was mean, <lb/>
            effeminate, and cowardly. By means of his wealth he had got the <lb/>
            appointment of Hipparch; yet he was unable to ride through the <lb/>
            market-place. He had given proof of what he was in the late <lb/>
            Eubcean campaign; in which he had contrived to shirk serving with <lb/>
            the cavalry who were under his command, and whom he slanderously <lb/>
            denounced before the people as being a disgrace to the country. He <lb/>
            was master of the Paralus, and had neglected to sail with it in time <lb/>
            for an important expedition: and had further abused his trust by <lb/>
            robbing the Cyzicenes of five talents, and rendering that people un­ <lb/>
            friendly to Athens. The honours which had been conferred upon him <lb/>
            only increased his arrogance and presumption. The only instance, in <lb/>
            which he had shown any appearance of liberality, was when he gave a <lb/>
            trireme to the state : but if the circumstances were looked at, it would <lb/>
            be seen that his motive was a base one. It was after the news had <lb/>
            been brought of the army being in danger at Tamynæ, and the council <lb/>
            ordered that all the remainder of the cavalry should be sent to <lb/>
            theirassistance : Midias, to escape going out with them, volunteered <lb/>
            to be a trierarch, by which he knew he would incur no personal <lb/>
            danger. It was clear therefore that the people owed him no <lb/>
            favour: he had nothing to set off against his evil deeds. When <lb/>
            any misfortunes happened to the people, his practice was to exult <lb/>
            over them. He never showed any pity to others, and therefore he <lb/>
            deserved none. Even the vote of censure passed against him in the <lb/>
            assembly had not made him in the least more humble: he had taken <lb/>
            pains to show that he was not afraid of it, and to exhibit as bold <lb/>
            a front as ever. The jury should give effect to the popular judgment <lb/>
            expressed at the time of the offence; for nothing had happened since <lb/>
            to cause any change in their feelings. He (Demosthenes) had been <lb/>
            strongly urged to go on with the prosecution, and on no account to <lb/>
            abandon it: he had resisted all the offers made to him by the friends <lb/>
            of Midias and all their menaces, and was determined to press the <lb/>
            case to conviction for the sake of public justice. Such a course was <lb/>
            the more imperative on account of the number of foreigners who had <lb/>
            witnessed the outrage; in whose estimation the dignity of the com­ <lb/>
            monwealth would be lowered, if it appeared that such things could <lb/>
            be done at Athens with impunity. He rebukes Eubulus and others <lb/>
             <pb n="63"/>
            who were about to intercede in the defendant's behalf warning them <lb/>
            that they ought not from any motives of private friendship or enmity <lb/>
            to impede the course of public justice. He (Demosthenes) was the <lb/>
            more entitled to redress for the forbearance which he had shown in <lb/>
            not returning the blow or resorting to any kind of violence. It was <lb/>
            necessary that men should be punished by the legal tribunals for <lb/>
            assaulting their neighbours: if not, people would take the law into <lb/>
            their own hands, and the most mischievous consequences would <lb/>
            ensue. One blow would beget another, and common affrays might <lb/>
            terminate in bloodshed and murder. Demosthenes had respected <lb/>
            the laws, and was entitled to their protection. If the jury did not <lb/>
            put them in force, every man might expect that his own personal <lb/>
            enemies would serve him as Midias had served Demosthenes. They <lb/>
            should regard his case as their own, and give him the same measure <lb/>
            of justice which they would look for themselves, if they suffered the <lb/>
            same injury. They, like him, were weak in their own individual <lb/>
            persons; they were strong only by the laws; and they should exert <lb/>
            that power with which the constitution armed them for the protec­ <lb/>
            tion of their fellow-citizens. They had every motive for inflicting <lb/>
            condign punishment on Midias : the cause of the injured party, the <lb/>
            peace of society, the vindication of the law, the honour of the state <lb/>
            and her religion.</p>
          <p>The date of the proceedings against Midias is a matter of controversy. <lb/>
            From the oration itself we learn, that Demosthenes was thirty-two <lb/>
            years of age when he commenced them. The birth of the orator is <lb/>
            by different critics and historians (to wit, Clinton, Becker, Boeckh, <lb/>
            Jacobs, Thirlwall, Grote, and others) variously assigned to the years <lb/>
            385, 383, and 381 B.C. Upon the solution of the same question <lb/>
            depend some other important dates, more especially that of the <lb/>
            Euboean campaign, in which Phocion gained the battle of Tamynæ.</p>
          <p>THE rudeness and the insolence, men of the jury, with <lb/>
            which Midias uniformly behaves to all, are pretty well known, <lb/>
            I imagine, both to you and the rest of my fellow-country­ <lb/>
            men. The course which any one of you would have taken <lb/>
            upon being grossly assaulted I took myself: I arraigned this <lb/>
            man before the people for committing a contempt of the fes­ <lb/>
            tival,l having not only received blows from him at the Diony­ <lb/>
            sia, but suffered many other outrages during the whole <unclear/> <note type="footnote"> 1 A man who insults the dignity of a court of justice or of either <lb/>

            view, were so incensed and. exasperated, so warmly sympa­ <lb/>
            thised with the wrongs which they knew I had sustained, <lb/>
            that, notwithstanding all the efforts of the defendant and <lb/>
            others in his behalf, they would not listen to them nor pay <lb/>
            any respect to their wealth or their promises, but passed <lb/>
            sentence against him unanimously: upon which, men of the <lb/>
            jury, many of you who are now in court and many other <lb/>
            citizens came up to me, urging and entreating that I would <lb/>
            proceed with the case, and deliver the defendant over to you: <lb/>
            for two reasons assuredly, as it seems to me, 0 Athenians; <lb/>
            both considering that I had been shamefully treated, and <lb/>
            wishing at the same time to punish him for what they had <lb/>
            observed of his conduct upon other occasions, as an audacious <lb/>
            ruffian who was beyond all control.1</p>

              cause for trial. And I find the same view taken by Meier in the <lb/>

              before the courts opened,)1 the more confident am I that <lb/>
              I shall obtain justice. ,I cannot think so ill of any juror as <lb/>
              to suppose, that you will be indifferent to a cause in which <lb/>
              you yourselves warmly took my part before; or that any one <lb/>
              of you, in order to enable Midias hereafter to commit assaults <lb/>
              with impunity, will give a verdict upon oath for aught but <lb/>
              what he considers just.</p>
          <p>If, men of Athens, I were about to accuse him of an un­ <lb/>
            constitutional measure, or of misconduct upon an embassy, <lb/>
            or anything else of the like description, I should not have <lb/>
            thought of making any request to you, considering that on <lb/>
            the trial of such matters the accuser has only to prove his <lb/>
            case, the defendant has to beg for mercy as well. But since, <lb/>
            my adversary having corrupted the umpires, and my tribe <lb/>
            having on that account been unjustly deprived of the tripod, <lb/>
            and I myself having received blows and been insulted in a <lb/>
            way that scarcely any choir-master ever was insulted before, <lb/>
            I am now prosecuting that judgment which the people <lb/>
            indignant and sympathising with my wrongs pronounced <lb/>
            against him, I will not hesitate even to be a suppliant. For, <lb/>
            if such an expression be admissible, I am now a defendant, <lb/>
            inasmuch as to obtain no redress for an insult is a sort of <lb/>
            calamity. I therefore pray and beseech you all, men of the <lb/>
            jury, in the first place to give me a favourable hearing; and <lb/>
            in the next place, if I prove that Midias the defendant has <lb/>
            insulted not only me, but you and the laws and all other <lb/>
            people, to avenge both me and yourselves. For thus the case <lb/>
            stands, men of Athens. I have been insulted, and my person <lb/>
            has been outraged on that occasion: but the point now to be <lb/>
            tried and decided is, whether or no it should be lawful to <lb/>
            commit such acts and to insult the first Athenian one meets <lb/>
            with impunity. Therefore, if any of you supposed before, <lb/>
            that this trial was got up for a private purpose, let them now <lb/>
            consider, it is for the public good that no one be permitted <lb/>
            so to behave ; and thus assuring themselves that the case is <lb/>
            one of general interest, let them give it their attentive con­ <lb/>
            sideration, and pronounce such verdict as appears most con­ <lb/>
            formable to justice. He shall first read you the law, under <lb/>
            which the plaints are preferred to the assembly: and then <note type="footnote"> 1 Or " before the court halls," as Pabst takes it. See Volume II. <lb/>

            the mouth Elaphebolion after the great Dionysia. Pabst, following <lb/>

            bring before the people those complaints, for which satisfaction has not <lb/>
            been made by the offender to the prosecutor; and, to show that a <lb/>
            compromise would be legal, Platner refers to Demosthenes cont. Mid. <lb/>
            563, 583; to which we may add the circumstance that Demosthenes is <lb/>
            said to have compromised his charge against Midias for a sum of <lb/>
            money. Meier (Att. Proc. p. 275) explains it thus : that the Prytanes <lb/>
            (or rather Proedri) were to bring before the people all the <foreign xml:lang="grc">προβολαί</foreign>, <lb/>
            except those of a trifling character, for which they were themselves <lb/>
            empowered to impose a fine. If we suppose the complaint to take the <lb/>
            name of <foreign xml:lang="grc">προβολή</foreign> upon its being presented to the Proedri, the expres­ <lb/>
            sion <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκτετισμένη προβολή</foreign> will create no difficulty; for as <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίκην τίνειν</foreign> <lb/>
            signifies to pay the damages awarded in an action, so <foreign xml:lang="grc">προβολὴν τίνειν</foreign> <lb/>
            may signify to pay the fine imposed by the magistrates before whom <lb/>
            the charge was brought; and <foreign xml:lang="grc">προβολήν</foreign> is not improperly used for <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιβολήν</foreign>, any more than <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίκην</foreign> is for <foreign xml:lang="grc">τίμημα</foreign> in the other case. Perhaps <lb/>
            there is more force in another objection urged by Plainer, viz. that <lb/>
            (according to this interpretation) the not bringing the case before the <lb/>
            assembly is made to depend on the non-payment, and not (as might <lb/>
            have been expected) on the imposition of the fine." </note><note type="footnote"> The former, I think, is the true interpretation. Spalding's and <lb/>

          <p>The Pandionian tribe had not had a choir-master for two <lb/>
            years: and the assembly having met, at which the Archon is <lb/>
            required by law to allot the flute-players for each chorus, <lb/>
            there was a discussion and a wrangling, the Archon blaming <lb/>
            the Superintendents of the tribe, and the Superintendents <lb/>
            the Archon; whereupon I came forward and volunteered2 to <lb/>
            take the office of choir-master, and on the drawing of lots I <lb/>
            got the first choice of flute-player. You, men of Athens, ex­ <lb/>
            pressed all of you the utmost satisfaction, both at my offer <note type="footnote"> 1 Because by the Athenian law a judgment-creditor had a lien upon <lb/>
            the goods of the debtor from the time that the judgment became due, <lb/>
            and he might seize them to pay his debt. See Appendix IX. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 According to the author of the second Argument to the Oration, <lb/>
            Midias partly excused himself on this ground, that Demosthenes, being <lb/>
            not regularly chosen Choragus, but only a volunteer, was not invested <lb/>
            with a sacred, or indeed an official character. It is observable that <lb/>
            Demosthenes himself does not argue this point at all, but assumes <lb/>
            throughout that he held the office according to law. In another part <lb/>
            of the same Argument it is mentioned as a fact appearing in the Oration, <lb/>
            that, when the umpires were sworn to adjudge the prize to the best <lb/>
            chorus, Midias said, " except that of Demosthenes." We find no such <lb/>
            express statement as this in the extant Oration, though Midias is plainly <lb/>
            accused of having tampered with the umpires, (pp. 520, 535.) Per­ <lb/>
            haps -the passage has been lost. It quite accords with the supposed <lb/>
            excuse of Midias, who might naturally contend, that, if Demosthenes <lb/>
            were not a properly appointed Choragus, the umpires could not lawfully <lb/>
            award the prize to him. And on the same ground he may have in­ <lb/>
            sisted, that the choristers of Demosthenes were not entitled to the <lb/>
            usual exemption from military service. </note> <lb/>

            and the chance that turned up; and you applauded and <lb/>
            clapped your hands in token of approbation and pleasure: <lb/>
            Midias the defendant (he alone, as it appears) took umbrage, <lb/>
            and he never ceased persecuting me with annoyances (great <lb/>
            and small) during the whole period of my office. What <lb/>
            trouble he caused me by opposing the discharge of my <lb/>
            choristers from military duty, or by offering himself as Super­ <lb/>
            intendent for the Dionysial and requiring you to elect him, <lb/>
            or in other ways of that sort, I shall pass by: for I am aware <lb/>
            that, although to me, who was then annoyed and insulted, <lb/>
            every one of these affronts caused as much irritation as the <lb/>
            gravest injury could have done, to you who are out of the <lb/>
            affair they would hardly appear worth going to trial about <lb/>
            I will mention that only, the hearing of which will excite <lb/>
            equal indignation in you all. Indeed the next proceeding, <lb/>
            of which I am about to speak, passes common bounds :2 and <lb/>
            I would not have attempted to accuse him now, had I not <lb/>
            instantly at the time convicted him before the assembly. My <lb/>
            sacred apparel—(all I consider sacred which a man provides <lb/>
            himself with for the festival, so long as he uses it)—and the <lb/>
            golden crowns, which I ordered for an ornament to my <lb/>
            chorus, he sought, men of Athens, clandestinely to destroy, <lb/>
            going by night to the house of the goldsmith ; and he effected <lb/>
            their destruction, but not entirely; for he was not able. Has <lb/>
            any one ever heard of so daring an act planned or perpetrated <lb/>
            in the city? Yet he was not satisfied with this: he even cor­ <lb/>
            rupted the teacher of my chorus, 0 Athenians; and had not <lb/>
            Telephanes the flute-player behaved in the kindest manner to <lb/>
            me, and determined, on seeing the trick, to drive this fellow <lb/>
            away, and to form and instruct my choristers himself, we <note type="footnote"> 1 The <foreign xml:lang="grc">Έπιμεληταὶ</foreign> assisted the Archon in superintending the business <lb/>

            should have taken no part in the contest, men of Athens, <lb/>
            but my chorus would have come in untrained, and we should <lb/>
            have fallen into the utmost disgrace. Nor did his insolence <lb/>
            stop here: it was so exuberant, that he offered to corrupt <lb/>
            the crowned Archon ;1 he incited the choir-masters to conspire <lb/>
            against me; bawling, threatening, standing by the umpires <lb/>
            while they took their oath, blocking, nailing up the side­ <lb/>
            scenes, (the public property! and he a private person!) he <lb/>
            continued giving me unspeakable trouble and annoyance. For <lb/>
            all that has taken place in the assembly, or before the um­ <lb/>

            and of all statements those are most to be relied on, to the <lb/>
            truth of which the hearers bear witness for the speaker. <lb/>
            Having then previously corrupted the umpires for the con­ <lb/>
            test of men, he put two crowning points as it were to all his <lb/>
            pranks :-he made a gross assault upon my person; and to <lb/>
            him it was mainly owing that my tribe, which did best in the <lb/>
            contest, failed to get the prize.</p>
          <p>The indignities which he has offered to me and my fellow- <lb/>

            festival, for which I preferred my plaint, are these, men <lb/>
            of Athens, and many more, of which I will give you as full <lb/>

            dent enough to make the attempt. (See p. 542.) We have to bear in <lb/>
            mind also, that the Archons were not generally men of wealth or <lb/>
            eminence. (See Appendix IV.) Supposing Midias really did exercise <lb/>
            any improper influence over the Archon, it may have been an additional <lb/>

              &amp;c. (p. 521). Yet, after this, the facts of the case are glanced rapidly <lb/>
              over, and we have only the testimony of the goldsmith, although it is <lb/>
              introduced by the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρώτην</foreign>, as if other evidence touching the sub­ <lb/>
              ject of the charge was immediately to follow. Buttmann in his second <lb/>
              Excursus contends with great probability, that there is a lacuna in <lb/>
              the oration after the evidence of the goldsmith, which was followed by <lb/>
              a series of depositions, interspersed with comments by the orator. <lb/>
              Whether such omission was owing to the negligence of a copyist, or <lb/>
              whether Demosthenes himself omitted part of the evidence in his <lb/>
              edition of the speech, or whether it was first published after his death <lb/>
              from an imperfect manuscript, is matter of uncertain conjecture. If <lb/>
              we could rely upon what is said by the anonymous author of the <lb/>
              second Argument, it would appear that certain passages of the edited <lb/>
              oration have been lost. (See ante, p. 68, note 2.) Besides what is there <lb/>

              some of the golden crowns : a fact which nowhere appears in the ex­ <lb/>

              speaks of a number of golden crowns ordered for his chorus, whereas <lb/>
              in the deposition only one is mentioned. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 According to Buttmann's emendation, <foreign xml:lang="grc">᾽Ερχιεύς</foreign>. Another conjec­ <lb/>

              by Demosthenes, broke into my house by night in company <lb/>
              with some other persons, and attempted to destroy the <lb/>
              crown and the dress, and a part thereof he spoiled, but was <lb/>
              not able to spoil the whole, because I appeared and pre­ <lb/>

          <p>I have much also to say, men of Athens, about the injuries <lb/>
            which he has done to others, as I stated at the commence­ <lb/>
            ment of my speech; and I have collected a number of his <lb/>
            freaks and outrages, which you shall hear presently. The <lb/>
            collection was easy; for the aggrieved parties came to me <lb/>
            themselves. But I wish first to notice the fallacies, by which <lb/>
            he will endeavour, as I am told, to mislead you. How they <lb/>
            should be answered,1 I deem it essential for me to apprise you <lb/>
            beforehand, and most important for you to hear: why? <lb/>
            Because the argument which prevents your being misled will <lb/>
            cause you to vote in accordance with your oaths and with <lb/>
            justice. Therefore you should give your especial attention <lb/>
            to such argument, and keep it in mind, and meet him at <lb/>
            every point when he addresses you.</p>
          <p>First, it is pretty clear from what (as I was told) he stated <lb/>
            to certain people in private, he will say-that, if I had <lb/>
            really suffered what I represent, I ought to have commenced <lb/>
            private actions against him; for the destruction of the <lb/>
            dresses and the golden crowns, and for all the annoyance <lb/>
            in relation to the chorus, an action for damage;2 for the <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τοὺςὑπὲρ τούτων λόγους</foreign> means, not what Midias will have to say, <lb/>
            but what may be said in reply to his argument: " the observations <lb/>
            which occur thereupon;" as Pabst expresses it: die Bemerkungen <lb/>

            one which is close to the Greek in point of form, and comprehends <lb/>
            every case to which it could be applied. As to the Attic law, the reader <lb/>
            is referred to Meier and Schömann, Attische Process, pp. 475—481. </note><note type="footnote"> <foreign xml:lang="grc">῞Υβρις</foreign> in common parlance signified any kind of insult, insolence, or <lb/>
            overbearing conduct. But in the language of Attic law it was used <lb/>
            specially to designate a personal outrage, that is, an assault attended <lb/>
            with contumely and indignity; including, 1. assault and battery, as we <lb/>
            call it; 2. indecent assault or violation. A person guilty of this offence <lb/>
            might be indicted, not only by the injured party, but by any other <lb/>
            citizen on behalf of the public : and it appears from the laws concern­ <lb/>
            ing <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὓβρις</foreign>, cited by AEschines (cont. Timarch. p. 3) and Demosthenes <lb/>
            (cont. Mid. p. 529), that he who violated those laws might be punished <lb/>
            even with death, if the jury pleased. The words of the laws are <lb/>
            general, and would appear to include both classes of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὕβρις</foreign> : yet there <lb/>
            is reason to doubt whether they are not both confined to the second <lb/>
            class. The context of Æschines undoubtedly points to the more <lb/>
            heinous offence only. That of Demosthenes leads us to a different view; <lb/>
            and Heraldus therefore thinks that the two orators cite different laws, <lb/>
            Demosthenes one relating to the first kind of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὕβρις</foreign>, AEschines one <lb/>
            relating to the second. It must be remembered however, that, even <lb/>
            where the text of the orators is free from interpolation, we can never <lb/>
            be sure that they quote statutes fairly, much less that they construe <lb/>
            them correctly. The mention of slaves in the law of Demosthenes is <lb/>
            a strong proof, as Meier and Schömann observe, that the law refers <lb/>
            only to the second kind of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὕβρις</foreign>, as the mere beating of a slave would <lb/>
            not amount to that offence. Another argument is furnished by the <lb/>
            passage now before us. " Midias " (says the orator) " will contend that <lb/>
            I ought to have proceeded against him by a <foreign xml:lang="grc">γραφὴ ὕβρεως</foreign>, not by <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">προβολή</foreign>.” But if a party indicted for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὕβρις</foreign> might be punishable with <lb/>
            death according to the statute, the one proceeding was not more lenient <lb/>
            than the other, and the supposed argument of Midias has no meaning <lb/>
            in it. We are driven to the conclusion, that there was some way of <lb/>
            proceeding for the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὕβρις</foreign> of which Midias was guilty, which involved <lb/>
            less grievous consequences than the accusation by <foreign xml:lang="grc">προβολή</foreign>. The diffi­ <lb/>
            culty may be solved either by supposing that the <foreign xml:lang="grc">γραφὴ ὕβρεως</foreign> (in a <lb/>
            case of the first kind) did not subject the offender to the penalty of <lb/>
            death, and that Demosthenes for his own purposes misapplies the <lb/>
            Athenian law; or, if the law itself was general, and in terms extended <lb/>
            to all cases of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὕβρις</foreign>, yet that it was not the practice of the courts to <lb/>
            apply it in its full rigour to complaints of mere assault and battery. <lb/>

            and you should be certain too. If I had not preferred <lb/>
            my plaint to the assembly, but sued him in an action, <lb/>
            the contrary objection would have started up, that, if there <lb/>
            was any truth in these charges, I should have arraigned <lb/>
            him before the assembly, and taken vengeance while the <lb/>
            offence was recent :-for the chorus belonged to the state, <lb/>
            and the apparel was all provided for the festival, and I the <lb/>
            sufferer was a choir-master. Who would ever have chosen <lb/>
            another mode of redress, rather than that which the law gives <lb/>
            against persons desecrating the festival?—All this I am sure <lb/>
            he would have urged then; for it is the practice, I believe, <lb/>
            with defendants who have done wrong, in order to defeat the <lb/>
            proceedings taken against them,l to suggest that others which <lb/>
            are not practicable should have been adopted; but it is the <lb/>
            part of wise judges, to give no heed to such arguments, and <lb/>
            whomsoever they find misbehaving themselves, to punish. <lb/>
            Don't then allow him to say, that the law gives me both private <lb/>
            actions and an indictment for assault. It does give them. But <lb/>
            let him show that he is not guilty of what I charge him with, <lb/>
            or that, being guilty, he has not committed a contempt of the <lb/>
            festival. It was for this I arraigned him before the assembly; <lb/>
            this is the matter upon which you will give your verdict now. <lb/>
            If I, foregoing the advantage of a private suit, give up my <lb/>
            revenge to the state, and have chosen this kind of trial, from <note type="footnote"> understand <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίκην</foreign> in connexion with <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὒβρεως</foreign>, it is used in the more ex­ <lb/>

              which I myself can reap no profit, surely it ought to procure <lb/>
              me favour with you, not to do me a mischief.</p>
          <p>I know that he will urge this argument strongly—" Do <lb/>
            not deliver me over to Demosthenes. Do not destroy me on <lb/>
            account of Demosthenes. Because I am at variance with <lb/>
            him, will you destroy me ? " Such expressions I know he <lb/>
            will use repeatedly, hoping by such language to excite a pre­ <lb/>
            judice against me. This however is not the right view of the <lb/>
            case, nor anything like it. You do not give up any offender <lb/>
            to any accuser : even1 where an individual has been wronged, <lb/>
            you do not inflict punishment at the instance of the aggrieved <lb/>
            party ; but, on the contrary, you have enacted laws before the <lb/>
            offences, when the parties who were to do or to suffer wrong <lb/>
            were both unknown. What do these laws provide ? They pro­ <lb/>
            mise to all people in the state, that, if any man be wronged, <lb/>
            they will afford him the means of redress. When therefore <lb/>
            you punish any person who infringes the laws, you do not <lb/>
            give him up to his accusers, but make the laws effectual for <lb/>
            yourselves. With respect to his way of putting it, that <lb/>
            " Demosthenes has been assaulted my answer is just and <lb/>
            equitable and fair for all. It was not to Demosthenes only <lb/>
            that he offered an affront on that day, but to your choir- <lb/>
            master; and what this imports, you may see by the following <lb/>
            consideration. You know of course, that the Judges here <lb/>
            have not any of them the name of Judge, but each some par­ <lb/>
            ticular name. If a person assaults or abuses any of them in <lb/>
            his private character, he will have an indictment for personal <lb/>
            outrage brought against him, or a civil action for abusive lan­ <lb/>
            guage; if in the character of Judge, he will be completely <lb/>
            disfranchised.2 Why? Because the party so acting goes a <note type="footnote"> 1 This clause appeared to Reiske to be a mere repetition of the pre­ <lb/>
            ceding one. I understand it however thus :-In no case do you inflict <lb/>
            punishment merely to satisfy the vengeance of the accuser. Even <lb/>
            where he does not prosecute purely on behalf of the public, but is <lb/>
            himself the party immediately injured, you do not punish the offender <lb/>
            in the manner that he desires, but as the laws have provided. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Άτιμία</foreign>, or disfranchisement, was a deprivation of civic rights either <lb/>
            total or partial, perpetual or temporary. Certain crimes, which were <lb/>
            regarded as heinous in themselves or highly injurious to the common­ <lb/>
            wealth, were punished with total and perpetual disfranchisement. <lb/>
            Such were, among others, cowardice in battle, perjury, ill-treatment of <lb/>
            parents, embezzlement of public money, bribery and corruption either <lb/>
            political or judicial, and (as we learn from this passage of Demosthenes) </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="76"/>
            step further and insults the laws, your public crown, and the <lb/>
            name of the commonwealth; for the Judge is not the name of <lb/>
            any person, but belongs to the commonwealth. Just so again <lb/>
            with the Archon : if any one strikes or abuses him with his <lb/>
            crown on, he is disfranchised ; if in his private character, he <note type="footnote"> assaulting a superior magistrate in the performance of his duty. <lb/>
            Æschines, in the oration against Timarchus (pp. 3, 4), enumerates the <lb/>
            privileges which might be forfeited. The chief of them were, the right <lb/>
            to speak or vote in the popular assembly, to be a juror or a witness in <lb/>
            courts of justice, to bring actions, to enter the precincts of the market- <lb/>
            place, to visit the temples or take part in the public sacrifices, to hold <lb/>
            magisterial and sacerdotal offices, to be sent as a herald or ambassador. <lb/>
            The degraded citizen bequeathed his misfortune to his children; and <lb/>
            it was exceedingly difficult to procure a release from it. The party <lb/>
            himself could not petition for that purpose; for he was not permitted <lb/>
            to open his lips in any court or assembly; and it was extremely hazard­ <lb/>
            ous for any other person to petition in his behalf. According to an <lb/>
            ancient law, restitution of the franchise could only be obtained by the <lb/>
            resolution of six thousand citizens voting by ballot. (See Demosthenes <lb/>
            cout. Timocr. p. 715.) We read of occasions when the republic was in <lb/>
            danger, when a general restitution of rights was granted by the people : <lb/>
            but these were rare. (See Xenophon, Hellen. ii. c. 2, s. 11, and the <lb/>
            second volume of this work, pp. 319, 393.) </note><note type="footnote"> The Atimia of persons indebted to the state was, as we have already <lb/>
            seen (ante, p. 52), only temporary, and might at any time be put an <lb/>
            end to by paying the debt. It was complete however as long as it <lb/>
            lasted. </note><note type="footnote"> Partial disfranchisement took place when a man was deprived of par­ <lb/>
            ticular rights for a time or otherwise by a special judgment or decree; <lb/>
            and it was called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀτιμία κατὰ πρόστξιν</foreign>. Thus, we are told, the soldiers <lb/>
            who remained in the city during the interregnum of the four hundred <lb/>
            in the Peloponnesian war, were deprived of the power to address the <lb/>
            people, or to be members of the council. After the expulsion of the <lb/>
            Thirty Tyrants, some persons were excluded from speaking in the as­ <lb/>
            sembly, some from being councillors, some from laying information, <lb/>
            &amp;c. But the common instance of partial disfranchisement was, where <lb/>
            a man accused another of some crime and failed to prosecute the <lb/>
            charge, or, having prosecuted, failed to obtain a fifth part of the votes, <lb/>
            and was thereby disabled to bring a similar accusation in future. <lb/>
            AEschines incurred this disgrace, when upon the prosecution of Ctesi­ <lb/>
            phon he failed to obtain a fifth part of the votes, and became incapaci­ <lb/>
            tated in future to institute the <foreign xml:lang="grc">γραφὴ παρανόμων</foreign>. See what Demosthenes <lb/>
            says in the Oration on the Crown, Vol. II. p. 98. </note><note type="footnote"> The term <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀτιμία</foreign> was applied also to that species of outlawry, which <lb/>

            by any one with impunity. As to this, see the Third Philippic, p. 122, <lb/>
            and Vol. I. p. 125 of this translation. On the whole subject the reader <lb/>

            is civilly responsible. And not only is this the law for the per­ <lb/>
            sons I have mentioned, but for all to whom the commonwealth <lb/>
            gives special protection or the privilege of wearing a crown <lb/>
            or any honour. And so with respect to me : if any of these <lb/>
            wrongs had been done to me by Midias on any other days <lb/>
            and in my private character, he should also have given me <lb/>
            satisfaction privately; but if in every part of his offensive <lb/>
            conduct he is shown to have insulted your choir-master on <lb/>
            a festal day, he is deserving of public wrath and vengeance. <lb/>
            For together with Demosthenes your choir-master was in­ <lb/>
            sulted ; (that is a title belonging to the state;) and on those <lb/>
            days too, when the laws forbid it. You ought, when you <lb/>
            enact laws, to consider what their character is; but when you <lb/>
            have enacted them, to maintain and put them in force. <lb/>
            This is in conformity with your oaths, and it is equitable <lb/>
            besides. There was the law of damage anciently; there was <lb/>
            the law of battery,1 and the law of outrage. If it had been <lb/>
            sufficient for persons committing any of those offences at the <lb/>
            Dionysia to be punished according to those laws, you would <lb/>
            have had no need of this additional law. But it was not <lb/>
            sufficient; evidently ; for you passed a sacred law for the God <lb/>
            himself concerning the feast-day. If any one then is amenable <lb/>
            both to those pre-existing laws, and also to this that was sub­ <lb/>
            sequently passed and to all the rest, should he on such ac­ <lb/>
            count have no punishment, or a more severe one rather? <lb/>
            I should think, a more severe one.</p>
          <p>Some one told me, that he was going about collecting <lb/>
            cases, and inquiring what people had ever been assaulted, and <lb/>
            that he intended to bring those cases forward, and give you the <lb/>
            histories of them: for example, 0 Athenians, the Committee- <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Αἰκία</foreign>, or battery, gave ground for a civil action, in which the plain­ <lb/>
            tiff sought to recover damages for the injury which he had sustained <lb/>
            in his person. The chief point of difference between this proceeding <lb/>
            and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">γραφὴ ὕβρεως</foreign> was, that in the former the gist of complaint was <lb/>
            the beating, in the latter it was the indignity. As under the Athenian <lb/>
            law an indignity offered to a citizen was considered an offence against <lb/>
            the state, therefore in the graver cases of assault a <foreign xml:lang="grc">γραφὴ ὕβρεως</foreign> might <lb/>
            be maintained. In a <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίκη αἰκίας</foreign> the proceedings were before the forty <lb/>
            itinerant judges. It was necessary, as in our own law in general, to <lb/>
            prove that the defendant struck the first blow, and that he did it <lb/>
            intentionally. The speech of Demosthenes against Conon was written <lb/>
            for the plaintiff in an action of this kind. (See Meier and Schömann, <lb/>
            Att Proc. pp. 544, 547.) </note> <lb/>

            man who once (they say) was struck in the assembly by <lb/>
            Polyzelus; and the Judge who lately was struck in rescuing <lb/>
            the flute-girl; and instances of the like description: imagining <lb/>
            that, if he can show many others to have suffered ill-usage, <lb/>
            you will be less indignant at what I have suffered. I <lb/>
            rather think, men of Athens, you ought to do the reverse, <lb/>
            if you are to regard the public welfare. For which of you is <lb/>
            ignorant, that such cases are numerous because offenders are <lb/>
            not chastised, and the only means of preventing outrages in <lb/>
            future is to see that every man who is caught suffers proper <lb/>
            punishment ? If then it is desirable to deter others, you <lb/>
            should punish the defendant on account of those very cases, <lb/>
            and the more severely, the more numerous and heinous they <lb/>
            are; if he and all men are to be encouraged, you should let <lb/>
            him off.</p>
          <p>Again, we shall find the defendant has not the same title <lb/>
            to indulgence which those men had. He that struck the <lb/>
            Judge had three excuses, drunkenness, love, and ignorance; <lb/>
            for it was done in the dark and at night-time. Polyzelus by <lb/>
            anger and hasty temper, outrunning reflexion, was betrayed <lb/>
            (as he said) into error : 2 certainly he was no enemy before, <lb/>
            and had no intention to insult. Midias however has none of <lb/>
            these things to allege : for he was an enemy, and insulted <lb/>
            me knowingly in the day-time, and not only on this but on <lb/>
            all occasions he is shown to have insulted me by design. <lb/>
            Nor indeed do I see any resemblance between the conduct of <lb/>
            the other parties and mine. The Judge, it will appear, took <lb/>
            no thought, felt no resentment, for you or for the laws ; but <lb/>
            was tempted by a certain sum of money to compromise the <lb/>
            cause on his own account. The party struck by Polyzelus <lb/>
            did just the same ; settled his quarrel in private, bade good­ <lb/>
            bye to you and the laws, and never brought Polyzelus into <lb/>
            court. If any one then desires to accuse those persons on <lb/>
            the present trial, he may bring these matters forward: but <note type="footnote"> 1 The Thesmothetes. Ulpian says, the Thesmothetæ used to walk <lb/>

            if the object be to make a defence to my charge against <lb/>
            Midias, these matters are the last that should be urged. For <lb/>
            my conduct has been just the opposite of theirs : I, it will <lb/>
            appear, have neither got nor attempted to get anything <lb/>
            myself: my claim to satisfaction for the laws, for the God, <lb/>
            and for you, I have honestly preserved, and have now handed <lb/>
            over to you.</p>
          <p>Don't suffer him then to bring forward such things : if he <lb/>
            insists upon it, don't put faith in him as an honest reasoner. <lb/>
            If this be your determination, he will not have a single word <lb/>
            to say. For what pretence, what natural or tolerable excuse <lb/>
            can be shown for his acts ? Anger, I suppose : this perhaps <lb/>
            he will say. I allow that, what a man suddenly without <lb/>
            stopping to reflect is driven to do, even though he acts with <lb/>
            insolence, he may fairly say he has done in anger : but what <lb/>
            one is discovered to have been doing for some time past, con­ <lb/>
            tinually, for many days together, in violation of the laws, <lb/>
            surely, so far from his doing this in anger, it becomes clear <lb/>
            that such a person has acted with premeditated insolence. <lb/>
            Since it appears therefore that he has done what I accuse <lb/>
            him of, and has done it to insult me, the next thing is to <lb/>
            consider the laws, men of the jury : for according to them <lb/>
            you are sworn to decide. And observe how much heavier <lb/>
            wrath and punishment is due in their estimation to wilful <lb/>
            and wanton trespassers, than to people offending in any other <lb/>
            way. In the first place, all these laws concerning damage, <lb/>
            (that I may begin with them,) if a man does a wilful injury, <lb/>
            require him to pay double damages, if an involuntary one, <lb/>
            single only : and with reason. For the injured party is in <lb/>
            any case entitled to redress; but the injurer is not by the <lb/>
            law pronounced equally culpable, whether he acts intention­ <lb/>
            ally or unintentionally. Again, the laws of homicide punish <lb/>
            wilful murderers with death and perpetual exile and confis­ <lb/>
            cation of property, but to those who kill accidentally they <lb/>
            extend compassion and mercy. And not only in these in­ <lb/>
            stances are the laws found to be severe to the perpetrators of <lb/>
            malicious outrage, but in every instance. How comes it <lb/>
            that, if a man does not satisfy a judgment, the law has not <lb/>
            left the ejectment-suit1 to be a private matter, but ordered <note type="footnote"> 1 The party entitled to execution was allowed to levy it himself by <lb/>

             <pb n="80"/>
            the imposition of a fine to the treasury ? And again, how <lb/>
            comes it that, if a man gets from another by mutual consent <lb/>
            either one talent or two talents or ten, and fraudulently <lb/>
            keeps them, he has no affair with the state; but, if a man <lb/>
            obtains a thing of small value, which he has forcibly taken <lb/>
            from another,1 the laws require a further penalty to be given, <lb/>
            as much to the treasury as to the individual ? Wherefore so ? <lb/>
            Because the legislator considered that all crimes committed <lb/>
            with violence are common injuries, even to those not imme­ <lb/>
            diately concerned ; for strength belongs to a few, but the <lb/>
            laws to all, and one acting under persuasion requires only <lb/>
            private redress, but one suffering violence requires public. <note type="footnote"> any one interfered and prevented him from obtaining the fruits of his <lb/>
            judgment, he might bring an action against such person, whether it <lb/>
            were the original adversary, or a pretended claimant of the property in <lb/>
            question. Such action was called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξούλης δίκη</foreign>, which, according to the <lb/>
            literal interpretation of the words, signifies " action of ejectment;" and <lb/>
            so therefore I translate it, although in our own law the term " eject­ <lb/>
            ment " is used only in proceedings for the recovery of real property, <lb/>
            whereas the Attic term is applied where either real or personal pro­ <lb/>
            perty was in dispute. If the plaintiff in this action was successful, <lb/>
            the court adjudged that he should recover the property, and also im­ <lb/>
            posed a fine upon the defendant, to punish him for impeding the process <lb/>
            of the law. </note><note type="footnote"> The action brought by Demosthenes against Onetor is an example of <lb/>
            this kind. Demosthenes, having recovered a judgment against Aphobus, <lb/>
            proceeded to take his lands in execution. Onetor claimed them as <lb/>
            mortgagee, and turned him off; whereupon Demosthenes, contending <lb/>
            that the mortgage was a mere pretence to defraud him of his rights, <lb/>
            commenced a <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίκη ἐξούλης</foreign> to try the question. </note><note type="footnote"> For further information on this subject, see Böckh's Public Economy <lb/>

            a <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίκη βιαίων</foreign>, "action of trespass," which was tried before the forty <lb/>
            itinerant judges. It is in this distinguishable from the <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίκη ἐξούλης</foreign>, that <lb/>
            it was maintainable only for trespasses to personal property, and where <lb/>
            actual violence was committed; whereas in the <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίκη ἐξούλης</foreign> the force <lb/>
            was generally a fiction of law. Doubtless there were cases where both <lb/>
            of these actions could be maintained: as for example, where a party <lb/>
            had taken a chattel in execution, and, after he had got it in his pos­ <lb/>
            session, it was retaken by force, a <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίκη βιαίων</foreign> might be brought for the <lb/>
            actual violence, and a <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίκη ἐξούλης</foreign> for the impeding of lawful execu­ <lb/>
            tion. On the other hand, if a defendant merely detained property <lb/>
            which was liable to be distrained upon, a <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίκη ἐξούλης</foreign> might be brought, <lb/>
            but not a <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίκη βιαίων</foreign>, for such detention was only violence in contem­ <lb/>

            Therefore he gave the indictments even for personal outrage <lb/>
            to any one that likes to prosecute, but the penalty he made <lb/>
            entirely public : for he considered that the aggressor injured <lb/>
            the state as well as the insulted party, and that the punish­ <lb/>
            ment was a sufficient compensation to the sufferer, and it was <lb/>
            not meet that for such injuries he should get money for him­ <lb/>
            self. And to such a length did he go, that, if an outrage be <lb/>
            done even to a slave, he allows an indictment for it just the <lb/>
            same : for he thought the question was, not, who is the suf­ <lb/>
            ferer, but what is the character of the action; and finding it <lb/>
            to be unjustifiable, he forbade the thing to be done either to <lb/>
            a slave or at all. For there is nothing, men of Athens, <lb/>
            nothing in the world more intolerable than a personal out­ <lb/>
            rage, or which you ought more deeply to resent. Take and <lb/>

          <p>" If any one commit a personal outrage upon man, woman, <lb/>
            or child, whether free-born or slave, or commit any illegal <lb/>
            act against any such person, let any Athenian that chooses <lb/>
            (not being under disability) indict him before the Judges; <lb/>
            and let the Judges bring the case. into the court of Heliae. <lb/>
            in thirty days from the date of the indictment, if no public <lb/>
            business prevent it, otherwise, as soon as possible. And <lb/>

          <p>You hear, 0 Athenians, the humanity of the law, which <lb/>
            allows not even slaves to be insulted in their persons. By <lb/>
            the Gods, let me ask—Suppose a man carried this law to the <lb/>
            barbarians, from whom slaves are brought to Greece, and <lb/>
            praising you and discoursing of Athens, addressed them thus <lb/>
            —" There are certain people in Greece so mild and humane <lb/>
            in their disposition, that, although they have suffered from <note type="footnote"> VOL. III. </note> <lb/>

            you many injuries, and enmity with you is their natural <lb/>
            inheritance, they permit not even those whom they have paid <lb/>
            a price for and purchased for slaves to be abused, but have <lb/>
            passed this law of state to prevent it, and have punished many <lb/>
            already with death for transgressing this law." If this were <lb/>
            told and explained to the barbarians, would they not all with <lb/>
            one voice (think ye) adopt you for their state-friends ? He <lb/>
            that transgresses such a law—not only esteemed among the <lb/>
            Greeks, but which even the barbarians would admire-judge <lb/>
            what punishment can be adequate to his deserts.</p>
          <p>Had I not been choir-master, 0 Athenians, when Midias <lb/>
            thus ill-used me, his crime would have been only a personal <lb/>

            mountain near Dodona, on the slope of which there was a temple of <lb/>
            Jupiter. Many years after, Buttmann himself suggested a new reading, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῷ Ναἴῳ</foreign>, and amused himself with making some further changes in the <lb/>

            worthy of notice for its facetious character. He objects to the words <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">διὰ ταχέων</foreign>, as casting the reproach of greediness upon the father of the <lb/>
            gods. Why (says he) should Jupiter be in such a hurry for his burnt­ <lb/>
            offerings ? " Famelicus fuerit Jupiter, qui adventum pinguium horum <lb/>
            boum, quorum nidore saturaretur, opperiri vix posset." These words <lb/>

            the Gods named in the several oracles, with every oracle that <lb/>
            comes they invariably add, that you must raise dances and <lb/>
            wear crowns in the fashion of your ancestors. It is plain <lb/>
            therefore that the choruses which are formed and the choir­ <lb/>
            masters, during those days when we meet to contend accord­ <lb/>

            ambitious choir-master of tragedians, Theosdotides, I believe, <lb/>
            hired his services. At first the rival choir-masters were dis­ <lb/>
            pleased and threatened to exclude him: however, when the <lb/>
            theatre was filled, and they saw the crowd assembled to see <lb/>
            the performance, they were afraid, they let him alone, no one <lb/>
            touched him : such has been the pious forbearance displayed <lb/>
            by all of you,1 that ever since that he has been training cho­ <lb/>
            ruses, and none even of his personal enemies prevents him. <lb/>
            So far are they from laying hands upon a choir-master.</p>
          <p>There is another person, Aristides of the CEneian tribe, <lb/>
            who has met with a similar calamity. He is by this time an <lb/>
            old man, and perhaps less of a chorister; but once he was <lb/>
            leader and chief chorister of his tribe. You are of course <lb/>
            aware that, if the leader be taken away, the rest of the chorus <lb/>
            is gone. However, though many choir-masters have been <lb/>
            full of emulation, none ever contemplated taking such an <lb/>
            advantage, or dared to remove this man or stop his per­ <lb/>
            formance ; for, as it was necessary for that purpose to lay hold <lb/>
            of the party with the hand, and was not lawful to summon <lb/>
            him before the Archon, as if one wished to remove an alien, <lb/>
            every one was afraid to be seen perpetrating so gross an <lb/>
            outrage. Is it not then shameful and atrocious, men of the <lb/>
            jury-when choir-masters, who imagined they might conquer <lb/>
            by such means, who have expended often all their substance <lb/>
            upon the choral exhibitions, have never ventured even to <lb/>
            touch what the laws allow, but are so cautious, so pious, so <lb/>
            moderate, that, notwithstanding all their expenditure and <lb/>
            anxiety, they restrain themselves and respect your wishes and <lb/>
            your zeal for the festival-that Midias, a private individual, <lb/>
            who has expended nothing, because he quarrelled with a man <lb/>
            and was his enemy, should insult and strike him—a man spend­ <lb/>
            ing his money in the choragic service and enjoying his full <lb/>
            civic rights—and should pay no regard either to the festival <lb/>
            or to the laws, or to what you would say, or to the God ?</p>
          <p>Many people have quarrelled, 0 Athenians, on public <note type="footnote"> 1 Literally, according to Bekker's reading: " Such a degree of piety <lb/>

            makes a neater sentence undoubtedly. Pabst, apparently adopting <lb/>

            matters as well as private; yet no man ever reached such <lb/>
            a pitch of impudence as to venture upon acts like these. <lb/>
            They say that Iphicrates once became a bitter enemy of <lb/>
            Diodes the Pitthean, and it happened that Tisias, the brother <lb/>
            of Iphicrates, furnished a chorus to contend with Diodes: <lb/>
            nevertheless, though Iphicrates had many friends and <lb/>
            possessed a large property, and thought as highly of himself <lb/>
            as might be expected of a man who had gained the honours <lb/>
            and distinctions which you had bestowed upon him, he never <lb/>
            went to the houses of goldsmiths by night, nor tore the <lb/>
            dresses prepared for the festival, nor corrupted a trainer, nor <lb/>
            prevented a chorus from taking lessons, nor did any of the <lb/>
            things which Midias was so active about; but giving way to <lb/>
            the laws and to the wish of his fellow-citizens, he was content <lb/>
            to see his enemy gaining the prize and the crown. And with <lb/>
            reason : he judged it proper to make such concessions to a state <lb/>
            in which he knew that he had been prosperous. Again, we <lb/>
            all know that Philostratus of Colonus accused Cbabrias when <lb/>
            he was tried for his life on the charge concerning Oropus,l <lb/>
            and that of all his accusers he had been the bitterest, <lb/>
            and that afterwards he furnished a chorus of boys at the <lb/>
            Dionysia and won the prize, and that Chabrias neither struck <lb/>
            him nor snatched away his crown, nor in any way intruded <lb/>
            where he had no business. I could tell you of many more <lb/>
            who have been enemies to one another on various accounts; <lb/>
            but I have never seen or heard of one, who bad reached such <lb/>
            a pitch of insolence as to do anything like this: and I am <lb/>
            sure none of you remember before (among all who have been <lb/>
            enemies either on private or public grounds) any one stand­ <lb/>
            ing by when the umpires were called, or dictating the oath <lb/>
            while they were sworn,2 or appearing at all as an enemy upon <lb/>
            such an occasion.</p>
          <p>Such things as these, 0 Athenians, if done by a choir- <lb/>
            master under the influence of rivalry, are in some degree <lb/>
            excusable: but to act thus for spite and annoyance, de­ <lb/>
            signedly and on all occasions, to show that a man's own power <lb/>
            is superior to the laws-by Hercules! such conduct is <lb/>
            odious, iniquitous, and against your interest. For if every <lb/>
            choir-master could thus predict—“ Let a particular person <lb/>
            be my enemy, say Midias or any equally bold and rich <note type="footnote"> 1 See Vol. II. p. 314. </note><note type="footnote">2 See ante, p. 68, note 2. </note> <lb/>

            I shall then be deprived of the victory, though I beat my <lb/>
            competitors ; I shall get the worst in every thing, and suffer <lb/>
            continual affronts”—who is so wretched a simpleton, as to <lb/>
            spend willingly a single drachm? No one surely. What <lb/>
            makes men public-spirited and liberal with their money is this, <lb/>
            I apprehend; that each believes he has his fair and equal share <lb/>
            of rights in a democracy. I, 0 Athenians, failed to obtain such <lb/>
            rights through the defendant; for, besides the insults which <lb/>
            I sustained, I was robbed also of the prize. I can make it <lb/>
            clear however to you all, that Midias, without doing anything <lb/>
            rude, without offering an affront or striking a blow, had it in <lb/>
            his power both to mortify me and show his own public spirit <lb/>
            in a lawful manner, so as not to leave a word for me to say. <lb/>
            When I, 0 Athenians, offered before the assembly to furnish <lb/>
            a chorus for the Pandionian tribe, he should then have risen <lb/>
            and offered to furnish a rival chorus for his own tribe, the <lb/>
            Erechtheian: so, taking the same ground with myself, and <lb/>
            spending his money in the same way, he should have dis­ <lb/>
            puted the prize with me, but not have insulted and beaten <lb/>
            me as he did even then. Instead however of doing this, by <lb/>
            which he would have honoured the people; instead of taking <lb/>
            any such spirited course, he fell foul upon me; me, who in <lb/>
            a fit of-whether you like to call it madness, 0 Athenians, <lb/>

            strength,) or patriotism — undertook the office of choir- <lb/>
            master: and so openly and brutally did he continue his <lb/>
            persecutions, that at last he could not even keep his hands <lb/>
            off my sacred robes or my chorus or my person.</p>
          <p>If1 there be any of you, 0 Athenians, whose wrath against <lb/>
            Midias does not incline him to pass sentence of death, he <lb/>
            takes not the proper view: for it is not right or just, that <lb/>
            the forbearance of the sufferer should help to save a man <note type="footnote"> 1 Reiske and Spalding argue from the abrupt tone of the oration, <lb/>

            some of you know whom I mean:) on him at a party of <lb/>
            pleasure quite private in Samos, because the striker thought <lb/>
            to insult him, he avenged himself by taking his life. Many <lb/>

          <p>By Jupiter and the Gods! Only think, men of Athens, <lb/>
            and consider among yourselves, how much more reason had <lb/>
            I to be angry, when Midias so treated 'me, than Euæon who <lb/>
            killed Bœotus had then. He was struck by an acquaintance, <lb/>
            who was drunk, in the presence of six or seven persons, also <lb/>
            acquaintances, who were sure afterwards to rebuke the one <lb/>
            party for his conduct, and to commend the other for having <lb/>
            been patient and restrained himself: and besides, he had <lb/>
            gone to supper in a house where he was not obliged to go. <lb/>
            I was insulted by an enemy, sober and in the morning, who <lb/>
            did it purposely and not under the excitement of wine, in <lb/>
            the presence of many persons both aliens and citizens, and <lb/>
            that too in a temple, and where, being choir-master, I was <lb/>
            compelled to go.- And I think, men of Athens, I have been <lb/>
            prudent, or rather fortunate, in having then restrained myself <lb/>
            and not been led on to do anything fatal: though I look with <lb/>
            great indulgence upon Euæon or any person who has de­ <lb/>
            fended himself from insult; and so, I think, did many who <lb/>
            sat in judgment upon that case; for I am told he was con­ <lb/>
            victed only by a single vote, although he neither shed tears <lb/>
            nor petitioned any of the jurors, nor did any act, great or <lb/>
            small, to conciliate the panel. Let me assume, that the <lb/>
            adverse voters condemned him not because he retaliated, but <lb/>
            because he went so far as to take life; while those who <lb/>
            acquitted him had allowed even this excess of vengeance to <lb/>
            a man outraged in his person. How say you then ? I, that <lb/>
            never retaliated at all-so careful have I been to prevent <lb/>
            anything fatal occurring-from whom should I obtain re­ <lb/>
            dress for my injuries ? From you, I conceive, and from the <lb/>
            laws: and other people should be warned by example, that <lb/>
            one is not to revenge oneself in a passion upon bullies and <lb/>
            blackguards, but to bring them before you, and you will <lb/>

          <p>Some of you, I dare say, men of the jury, expect to hear <lb/>
            what was the quarrel existing between us; for you must <lb/>
            imagine that no person could treat a fellow-citizen with such <lb/>
            brutal violence without some strong provocation. I will give <lb/>
            you then a full explanation of it from the beginning, to con­ <lb/>

          <p>When I brought actions against my guardians for my <lb/>
            paternal inheritance, being quite a stripling, ignorant even of <lb/>
            this man's existence, and having no knowledge of him, (would <lb/>
            I had not any now!), when the cause was coming on to be <lb/>
            tried in about three or four days, he and his brother rushed <lb/>
            into my house, and tendered me the trierarchy.1 It was the <lb/>
            brother who gave his name and made the tender, Thrasylo­ <lb/>
            chus; but all the acts and proceedings were by Midias. And <lb/>
            first they broke open the doors of the apartments, as if they <lb/>
            became theirs at once by the exchange: then in the presence <lb/>
            of my sister, who was still in the house and was a young <lb/>
            maiden, they uttered obscene language, such as only people <lb/>
            like them would utter;2 (for I could not be induced to repeat <lb/>
            to you any of the words then spoken;) and on my mother <lb/>
            and me and all of us they poured every possible kind of <lb/>
            abuse. But the most shameful part of all—beyond mere <lb/>
            words-was this: they gave my guardians a release of the <lb/>
            actions, as, if they belonged to them. Old matters are these <lb/>
            certainly, yet I think some of you remember them; for the <lb/>
            whole city at the time heard of the exchange, and the plot <lb/>
            which they laid, and their brutal behaviour. I being then <lb/>
            quite friendless and very young, that I might not be deprived <note type="footnote"> 1 See the second Oration against Aphobus, 840, 841. </note><note type="footnote"> The trierarchy was at this time shared between two persons. Thra­ <lb/>

            recover not merely what I actually obtained, but all that <lb/>
            I knew I had been deprived of, gave to these men twenty <lb/>
            minas, the sum for which they had provided a deputy <lb/>

          <p>Such is the foul usage which I then received from these <lb/>
            men. Having afterwards brought an action against Midias <lb/>
            for abusive language,1 I obtained judgment by default; for he <lb/>
            did not appear. The judgment was not paid, and I became <lb/>
            entitled to execution;2 yet I never touched any of his effects, <lb/>
            but again brought an action of ejectment, and down to the <lb/>
            present day I have not been able to try it: such tricks and <lb/>
            pretences does he find to baffle me with. And whilst I deem <lb/>
            it my duty to do everything cautiously and by process of law <lb/>
            and justice, the defendant, as you hear, thought proper to <lb/>
            offer shameful affronts, not only to me and mine, but to my <lb/>
            fellow-tribesmen on my account. Call me the witnesses to <lb/>
            prove the truth of these statements, to show you that, before <lb/>
            I have obtained satisfaction for my former wrongs, I have <lb/>

            founded upon the damage done to a man's character by saying injurious <lb/>
            things of him to third persons. The Athenian action for abusive lan­ <lb/>
            guage was irrespective of such damage, and regarded only the insult <lb/>
            offered to the plaintiff himself. At Athens, as with us, there were <lb/>
            certain words made specially actionable by law, such as <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνδροφόνος, <lb/>
            ῥίψασπις, πατραλοίας</foreign>, and doubtless many others. Lysias, in the speech <lb/>
            which he wrote for the plaintiff against Theomnestus (the only example <lb/>
            we have of a speech in a <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίκη κακηγορίας</foreign>), makes him say that he con­ <lb/>
            sidered this kind of action illiberal and litigious (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνελεύθερον καὶ Φιλό­ <lb/>
            δικον</foreign>). The truth of the words spoken seems to have been a good plea <lb/>
            to the action. Five hundred rachms were the damages given by law <lb/>
            to the plaintiff, if he succeeded. Demosthenes, as it appears, obtained <lb/>
            a judgment for a thousand (see p. 543); but he may have been entitled <lb/>

            that Midias has been the cause of all the delay by continually <lb/>
            making excuses and postponing the cause."</p>
          <p>Let me tell you, men of Athens, what a base thing he has <lb/>
            done in the affair of the suit; and mark his insolent and <lb/>
            overbearing behaviour on every occasion. In the suit—I <lb/>
            mean that in which I obtained judgment against him—I got <lb/>
            for arbitrator1 Straton of Phalerum, a man of humble <lb/>
            means and no lawyer,2 but of unexceptionable character and <lb/>
            thoroughly honest; which indeed not properly or justly, but <lb/>
            most shamefully, has been the ruin of the poor fellow. This <lb/>
            Straton, acting in the arbitration for us, when the day of hear­ <lb/>
            ing had at last come, and all the tricks of the law, affidavits <lb/>
            and please had been gone through, and nothing further <lb/>
            remained, at first requested me to defer the arbitration, then <lb/>
            to adjourn it till the following day; at length, as I would <lb/>
            not consent, and the defendant did not appear, and it was <lb/>
            getting late, he made an award against him. In the evening <lb/>
            after dusk Midias the defendant comes to the office of the <lb/>
            Archons,4 and finds the Archons going out, and Straton just <lb/>
            going away after giving the judgment by default, as I learned <lb/>
            from one of the persons present. At first he actually pressed <lb/>
            Straton to return the award which he had given against him <lb/>
            as an award in his favour, and the Archons to alter the <lb/>
            record; and he offered them fifty drachms: finding that they <lb/>
            resented the thing, and that neither of the parties could be <lb/>
            prevailed upon, after threatening and abusing them, he goes <lb/>
            away, and does what ?-Only observe his malignity ! Having <lb/>
            moved for a new trial, he never took the oath, but allowed <lb/>
            the award to become absolute against him, and was returned <lb/>
            as unsworn.5 Wishing his design to remain a secret, he <note type="footnote"> 1 See Appendix X. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Απράγμων</foreign>. Spalding : " forensium rerum rudis." Pabst: wenig <lb/>

            to put the vote contrary to all the laws, without superscribing <lb/>
            the name of any witness to the summons, laying a charge in <lb/>
            the defendant's absence, no one appearing, he disfranchises <lb/>
            and outlaws the arbitrator. And now an Athenian citizen, <lb/>
            because Midias suffered a judgment by default, has been <lb/>
            deprived of all his civic rights and been completely dis­ <lb/>
            franchised : and it is not safe, as it appears, either to bring <lb/>
            an action against Midias for an injury, or to be an arbitrator <lb/>
            for him, or even to walk on the same road.</p>
          <p>You must look therefore at the matter thus, and consider <lb/>
            what brutal injury Midias sustained, that he should contrive <lb/>
            to take so great a revenge upon a fellow-countryman: and if it <note type="footnote"> subject to his putting in an affidavit, alleging a sufficient excuse for his <lb/>
            absence, and to his satisfying the Arbitrator, on cause being shown by <lb/>
            the plaintiff, that he ought to have the cause re-heard. He failed how­ <lb/>
            ever to put in an affidavit within the time allowed by law, and thus <lb/>
            the motion fell to the ground. A return was made by Straton to the <lb/>
            Thesmothetæ, showing these facts, and the judgment against Midias <lb/>
            was duly entered of record and became irreversible. </note><note type="footnote"> See Meier and Schömann, Att. Proc. p. 756, &amp;c., and Appendices IX. <lb/>

            liquidated damages of ten minas, (an action to which he did <lb/>
            not appear as he ought,) rather than he should give satis­ <lb/>
            faction if he had done wrong, or otherwise get the verdict, an <lb/>
            Athenian citizen must be disfranchised, and obtain neither <lb/>
            pity nor hearing nor mercy, things which even real wrong- <lb/>
            doers are entitled to.</p>
          <p>However, as he had disfranchised the person he wished, <lb/>
            and you had so far gratified him, and he had glutted the <lb/>
            savage feeling which prompts him to take these courses, at <lb/>
            least he did this-he has paid the damages, on account of <lb/>
            which he ruined the man. No; not a copper coin to this <lb/>
            day: he submits rather to be defendant in a suit of eject­ <lb/>
            ment. So Straton has been disfranchised and ruined in my <lb/>
            quarrel:1 Midias has suffered nothing at all, but turns upside <lb/>
            down the laws, the arbitrators, everything that he pleases. <lb/>
            And thejudgment against the arbitrator, which he contrived <lb/>
            to get without a summons, he has made valid for himself: <lb/>
            that which I recovered against him with his full knowledge, <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Παραπόλωλε</foreign>. Neither Buttmann's " immerenter,” nor Reiske's <lb/>

            expresses the true force of <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρά</foreign>. Schaefer, referring to the Oration on <lb/>
            the Embassy, p. 396, gives us a right notion of the meaning : " Dicit <lb/>
            orator Stratonem Midiæ <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάρεργον</foreign> factum esse." But it is more difficult <lb/>
            to translate than to write a note about it. We might say in English, <lb/>
            " The ruin of Straton has been a little episode [or interlude] in our <lb/>

            after summons and default, he nullifies. Yet if Midias must <lb/>

            non-appearance, how should you avenge yourselves on him, <lb/>

          <p>“ We, Nicostratus of Myrrhinus, Phanias of Aphidna, know <lb/>
            that Demosthenes, for whom we are witnesses, and Midias, <lb/>
            the party prosecuted by Demosthenes, when Demosthenes <lb/>
            brought against him the action for abusive language, chose <lb/>
            Straton for an arbitrator, and that, when the day appointed <lb/>
            by law arrived, Midias did not attend the arbitration, but <lb/>
            absented himself. And judgment having been given against <lb/>
            Midias by default, we know that Midias urged both Straton <lb/>
            the arbitrator and us, who were Archons at that time, to <lb/>
            declare the award in his favour, and that he offered us fifty <lb/>
            drachms; and when we would not listen to his offer, he <lb/>
            threatened us and went away. And we know that on this <lb/>
            account Straton was circumvented 2 by Midias and disfran­ <lb/>
            chised against right and justice."</p>
          <p>Now read the law concerning the arbitrators. 3 <note type="footnote"> 1 Here, as in other places, we perceive the difficulty of translating <lb/>

            that name, because the gist of it was the insult offered to an Athenian <lb/>
            citizen, and through him to the state. Therefore in the two clauses <lb/>
            before us the orator can use this word with a double application. We <lb/>

          <p>Now call me Straton himself, who has undergone this mis­ <lb/>
            fortune. I suppose he will be allowed to stand. There he is, <lb/>
            O Athenians; a poor man perhaps, but not a bad one; a <lb/>
            citizen, who has served in every campaign during his age of <lb/>
            service, and committed no crime; yet there he stands in <lb/>
            silence, deprived not only of all other common privileges, but <lb/>
            of the power to speak and to complain: and it is not lawful <lb/>
            for him even to tell you whether he has been treated justly <lb/>
            or unjustly. And such treatment he has suffered from <lb/>
            Midias, from the wealth and insolence of Midias, because he <lb/>
            is poor and without friends and one of the many. And had <lb/>
            he accepted the fifty drachms from him in contempt of the <lb/>
            laws, and declared the award which he pronounced against <lb/>
            him to be in his favour, he would have been in possession of <lb/>
            his franchise, free from all harm, and sharing equal privileges <lb/>
            with the rest of us: but since he regarded Midias less than <lb/>
            justice, and feared the laws more than his threats, he has <lb/>
            fallen into the dreadful calamity which you see by this <lb/>
            person's contrivance.</p>
          <p>And will you let a man so cruel, so unfeeling-who takes <lb/>
            such vengeance for injuries which he himself only says he <lb/>
            has sustained, for he never had sustained any-will you let <lb/>
            him escape, when you have caught him inflicting an outrage <lb/>
            on a fellow-citizen ? And if he pays no regard either to the <lb/>
            festival or to religion or anything else, won't you convict <lb/>
            him?—won't you make him an example? And what will <note type="footnote"> show that Stratonis judgment was legal. As this does not appear from <lb/>
            the law in the text, it has been thought either to be spurious, or an <lb/>
            imperfect copy. Certainly the mere fact of there being no appeal from <lb/>
            the arbitrator's decision would not render it more criminal in Midias <lb/>
            to revenge himself as he did; for, if the decision was wrong, the injury <lb/>
            done to Midias was increased by the award being final. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. III. </note> <note type="footnote"> H </note> <lb/>

            you say, men of the j ury ? In Heaven's name, what fair or <lb/>
            honourable excuse will you have to allege ? Peradventure, <lb/>
            that he is an odious blackguard; for that is the truth. But <lb/>
            surely, 0 Athenians, you ought to detest such people rather <lb/>
            than to pardon them. Or because he is rich ? But this you <lb/>
            will find is pretty much the cause of his insolence: therefore <lb/>
            you should rather take away the means which enable him to <lb/>
            be insolent, than pardon him in consideration of them. To <lb/>
            allow an audacious blackguard like him to have wealth at <lb/>
            his command, is to have put arms in his hands against <lb/>
            yourselves.</p>
          <p>What then remains ? To pity him, I suppose. He will <lb/>
            have his children1 by him and weep, and beg for mercy on <lb/>
            their account: that resource is left him. But you are surely <lb/>
            aware, that pity is due to men who suffer something unjustly <lb/>
            which they cannot bear, not to men who are punished for <lb/>
            their crimes. And who can justly pity the defendant's chil­ <lb/>
            dren, seeing that he pitied not the children of this man, who <lb/>
            (besides other causes of distress) see no possible remedy for <lb/>
            their father's calamity; for there is no debt by paying which <lb/>
            this man can recover his position: he is just absolutely dis­ <lb/>
            franchised by the fury and ruffianism of Midias. Who then <lb/>
            shall cease to be a ruffian—who shall be deprived of the <lb/>
            wealth, which makes him such-if you pity the defendant as an <lb/>
            ill-used person ? And if a poor man, without having done any <lb/>
            wrong, has fallen into the deepest misfortunes by the iniquity <lb/>
            of the defendant, will you refuse even to share his resent­ <lb/>
            ment ? Heaven forbid ! No one deserves to obtain mercy, <lb/>
            who is never merciful; or forgiveness, who is unforgiving. I <lb/>

            there are people to collect and make up, but another also. <lb/>
            For example: here am I, a person civil to all, compassionate, <lb/>

            like payment. You then, having paid up such a subscrip­ <lb/>
            tion, deserve to collect the same for yourself.</p>
          <p>I conceive therefore, 0 Athenians, that even if I had <lb/>
            nothing further to charge Midias with, if what I am about to <lb/>
            mention were not more dreadful than what I have stated, <lb/>
            you would be justified by those statements both in convicting <lb/>
            him and in passing the severest sentence. The case however <lb/>
            stops not here, nor shall I have any difficulty in carrying it <lb/>
            further; such ample matter of accusation has he provided. <lb/>
            His getting up an indictment against me for desertion of <lb/>
            post, and his hiring an agent for the purpose, that rascal of <lb/>

            the scoundrel never brought it to a hearing before the magis­ <lb/>

            in which the members subscribed money for the relief of their needy <lb/>

            same kindness to be shown to himself, if ever he should stand in need <lb/>
            of it. As it is in a club, so is it in life, says the orator: what a man <lb/>
            does to others, they will and should do to him in return. With a <lb/>

              and methinks, he would have added with pleasure, if it had <lb/>
              been possible, that he had indicted on the hiring of Midias. <lb/>
              But this I pass by; for, as he has disfranchised himself by <lb/>
              not prosecuting the charge, I need no further satisfaction for <lb/>
              it; I have sufficient already. But one shocking and cruel <lb/>
              thing that he has done, 0 Athenians, a crime, as it appears <lb/>
              to me, not only against the state, but against our common <lb/>
              religion, I will tell you. When that poor unfortunate man, <lb/>
              Aristarchus,l the son of Moschus, had a foul and grievous <lb/>
              charge hanging over him, at first, 0 Athenians, he went about <lb/>
              the market-place, and dared to spread atrocious and impious <lb/>
              reports about me, that I had done the deed; but as he got <lb/>
              nothing by that, he went to the relations of the deceased, <lb/>
              who were bringing the charge of murder against Aristarchus, <lb/>
              and. promised to give them money, if they would accuse me <lb/>
              of the crime. And neither gods nor sanctity nor anything <lb/>
              else stood in the way of his making this proposal: he never <lb/>
              hesitated: he was not ashamed to look those he addressed <lb/>
              in the face, while fastening on a man this horrible calumny: <lb/>
              having but one object in view, to destroy me by every pos­ <lb/>
              sible means, he would leave no stone unturned, as if it were <lb/>
              right that any person who has been insulted by Midias, and <lb/>
              determines to obtain redress instead of holding his tongue, <lb/>
              should be utterly exterminated and not allowed to rest, <lb/>
              should even stand convicted of desertion of post, and be <lb/>
              exiled on a charge of murder, and all but crucified.</p>
          <p>When he is convicted of all this, in addition to the insults <lb/>
            offered me as choir-master, what pardon or what pity is he <lb/>
            entitled to at your hands? For my part, 0 Athenians, I <lb/>
            consider he has been my murderer by these acts: on that <note type="footnote"> 1 This Aristarchus was charged with the murder of Nicodemus, a <lb/>
            friend of Eubulus, according to Ulpian, who says that Demosthenes on <lb/>
            that account was suspected of having instigated the murder. AEschines <lb/>
            insinuates nearly as much in the Oration against Timarchus, p. 24, <lb/>
            where he imputes to his rival an infamous connexion with Aristarchus. <lb/>
            The story in Athenæus (xiii. 592), taken seemingly from Idomeneus, <lb/>
            repeats the calumny of Midias, that Demosthenes was the actual mur­ <lb/>
            derer. Aristarchus however was believed to be guilty, and fled from <lb/>
            Athens. It is remarked by Ulpian, that Demosthenes, having been his <lb/>
            friend, avoids all expression of opinion as to his guilt or innocence. </note> <lb/>

            Demosthenes in the indictment for the murder.“ 1 <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Παραγράψασθαι</foreign>. Buttmann, following Reiske, thinks that the pre­ <lb/>
            position conveys the idea of wrong or fraud, as in <foreign xml:lang="grc">παραπρεσβεύειν</foreign>, and <lb/>
            that <foreign xml:lang="grc">γράψασθαι</foreign>has the meaning of to indict or accuse. In my judgment <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρὰ</foreign> signifies insertion only, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δημοσθένει τὴν γραφὴνπαραγράψασθαι</foreign> is <lb/>
            " to amend the indictment by inserting the name of Demosthenes," or <lb/>
            more literally, "to have a charge inserted in the indictment against <lb/>
            Demosthenes,”—<foreign xml:lang="grc">γράψασθαι</foreign> signifying “to cause to be written," and <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δημοσθένει</foreign> being what grammarians call the dativus incommodi. As the <lb/>
            various uses of <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρὰ</foreign> are apt to puzzle the student, it may not be amiss <lb/>
            if we stop for a moment to consider them. </note><note type="footnote"> The original meaning of <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρὰ</foreign> , to which all its uses are referable, is <lb/>
            alongside of; as in <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρὰ ποταμόν, παράλληλος</foreign>. That which is by the <lb/>
            side of a thing is close or near to it: and hence we get the sense of <lb/>
            by, with, among; as in <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάρειμι, παραγίγνομαι</foreign>, &amp;c. Metaphorically, one <lb/>
            thing is said to go along with another, if it is a consequence of it: and <lb/>
            hence Trapa comes to signify by means, on account, in consequence of ; as <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρὰ ποῦτο γενέσθαι</foreign>. As things are placed by the side of each other in <lb/>
            order to be compared, <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρὰ</foreign> naturally enough signifies in comparison with. <lb/>
            Again, transferring the idea of proximity and connexion from place to <lb/>
            time, it becomes throughout or during; a3 <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρὰ πᾶσαν τὴν χορηγίαν</foreign>. <lb/>

            a few words to you; and by Jupiter and the Gods, men of the <note type="footnote"> Others, which appear at first to be inconsistent, are obtained by a dif­ <lb/>
            ferent application of the primary meaning. Thus, a thing which is by <lb/>
            the side of another does not coincide with it: two parallel lines, how­ <lb/>
            ever near, cannot meet. Hence we get the idea of difference or non- <lb/>
            conformity, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρὰ</foreign> is used for aside, contrary to, beyond ; as in <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρὰ <lb/>
            νόμον, παρὰ λόγον, παράδοξος, παραβαίνω, παρίημι</foreign>, I put aside or omit, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">παροράω</foreign>, I look on one side, avoid seeing, overlook, &amp;c., <foreign xml:lang="grc">παραπρεσβεύω</foreign>, <lb/>
            I act contrary to my instructions as ambassador. The same sort of <lb/>
            double aspect is found in our own word beside. Thus we say, I Bit <lb/>
            beside him ; and also, beside the mark, beside the argument. The sense of <lb/>
            but for is got from the notion of setting aside; as <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρ' ὀλίγαςψήφους <lb/>
            ὴτιμώσατε</foreign>, but for a few votes you had disfranchised him; without [or <lb/>
            setting aside] a few which gave a majority for acquittal, he was condemned. <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Παρὰ</foreign> with a genitive signifies from the side of, from off; as <foreign xml:lang="grc">παῖς παρὰ <lb/>
            πατρὸς λαμβάνει χρήματα</foreign>, or <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρχήν</foreign>, indicating the quarter from which <lb/>
            the property or title is derived, without any idea of loss to the party <lb/>
            giving, as in <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπολαμβάνω</foreign>. Between <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀφαιρεῖσθαι</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">παραιρεῖσθαι</foreign> there is <lb/>
            this distinction : <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀφαιρεῖσθαιι</foreign>s, to take right away ; <foreign xml:lang="grc">παραιρεῖσθαι</foreign>, to de­ <lb/>
            tach, to draw off. Thus, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν ἐκείνων συμμαχίαν παραιρούμενος</foreign> (Or. ad <lb/>
            Epist. 153): Philip was drawing over to himself the allies of the Thebans <lb/>
            -not directly taking them away, but indirectly and gradually-filching <lb/>
            their confederacy. </note><note type="footnote"> Now let us come to <foreign xml:lang="grc">παραγράφειν</foreign>. This, according to the first idea of <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρὰ</foreign>, signifies to write by the side; as if you add something in the <lb/>
            margin of a book, or set one page or column opposite another. Hence <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">παραγεγραμμένοι νόμοι</foreign>. (See the explanation, Vol. II. p. 46; and this <lb/>
            Volume, p. 34.) A plea was called <foreign xml:lang="grc">παραγραφή</foreign>, because it was entered, <lb/>
            or at least produced in court, with the plaintiff's declaration, so that <lb/>
            both could be viewed together. Anything inserted in a document may <lb/>
            be said <foreign xml:lang="grc">παραγράφεσθαι</foreign>. And as this is sometimes done fraudulently, <lb/>
            for example, when a name or a clause is forged in a will or a register, <lb/>
            the idea of fraud is in such case attached to the word itself: hence <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρεγγραπτὸς πολίτης</foreign>. In our own language we may say—“ Such a clause <lb/>
            was inserted in the will”—with an opprobrious signification, meaning <lb/>
            that it was put in clandestinely, or not by the testator. But we must <lb/>
            observe, there is no notion of fraud contained in <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρά</foreign>, unconnected <lb/>
            with the verb. Unless therefore the act of insertion itself constitutes <lb/>
            a fraud, nothing criminal is imputed by the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">παραγράφειν</foreign>. And <lb/>
            this is precisely the case here. If Midias had prevailed on the rela­ <lb/>
            tions of Nicodemus to accuse Demosthenes of murder, they would have <lb/>
            been guilty of a heinous conspiracy undoubtedly; but the manual act of <lb/>
            altering the indictment would in no way have increased their crime; <lb/>
            it would have been a mere formality without anything clandestine or <lb/>
            irregular in it. The verb is used here in the same way as in the <lb/>
            Oration against Bœotus, p. 1003, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πατρὸς ἄλλου σεαυτον παραγράφειν</foreign>, <lb/>

            jury, I entreat that in every part of the case you will put to <lb/>
            yourselves this question-What would any one of you have <lb/>
            done, had he been so treated ?—what anger would he have felt <lb/>
            on his own account against the party using him so ? For my <lb/>
            part, grieved as I have been at the insults offered me during <lb/>
            my public service, I have been still more grieved, men of <lb/>
            Athens, and felt deeper indignation at what followed. For <lb/>
            really where do you think wickedness will end ? or how can <lb/>
            impudence, insolence, and brutality be exceeded, when a man, <lb/>
            after doing dreadful things—yes, by heaven, and heaping <lb/>
            injuries upon me!—instead of repenting and making amends, <lb/>
            proceeds to commit far greater atrocities, and employs his <lb/>
            wealth, not so as to promote his own private interest without <lb/>
            hurting another, but for the opposite purpose, that he may <lb/>
            degrade and insult his neighbour, and then felicitate himself <lb/>
            upon his opulence ? Such, men of Athens, have been the <lb/>
            practices of Midias against myself. He accused me falsely of <lb/>
            a murder, with which I was in no way concerned, as the <lb/>
            event proved; he indicted me for desertion of post, having <lb/>
            himself deserted his post thrice; and the troubles in Eubœa, <lb/>
            which were caused by his friend Plutarch—(I had nearly <lb/>
            forgotten this)—he attempted to lay them to my charge, <lb/>
            before it became evident to all that the thing had been con­ <lb/>
            trived by Plutarch. And lastly, when the lot had fallen on <lb/>
            me to be councillor, he accused me on my probation; and <lb/>
            the thing came to a terrible pass for me: for, instead of <lb/>
            obtaining satisfaction for my wrongs, I was in danger of being <lb/>
            punished for things with which I had no concern. And thus <lb/>
            ill-used as I am, persecuted in the manner that I describe to <lb/>
            you, though not a person wholly friendless or without means, <lb/>
            I know not, 0 Athenians, what course to take. For-if <lb/>

            dictment, and that of Demosthenes substituted. The erasure and <lb/>
            insertion might both have been expressed by the verb <foreign xml:lang="grc">μεταγράφειν</foreign>, but <lb/>
            this was unnecessary. </note><note type="footnote"> I will only add, that the sentence is not improved by Reiske's inter­ <lb/>

            nothing: but when the council was sitting to consult on that <lb/>
            business, Midias presented himself—"Councillors," said he, <lb/>
            " are you ignorant of the affair ? When you have the mur­ <lb/>
            derer"—meaning Aristarchus—"are you delaying and in­ <lb/>
            quiring ? Have you lost your senses ? Won't you put him <lb/>
            to death? Won't you go to his house and arrest him?" <lb/>
            Such was the language of this impudent and abominable <lb/>
            creature, though the day before he had left the house of <lb/>
            Aristarchus, and was formerly on as intimate terms with him <lb/>
            as any one, and Aristarchus before his misfortune had most <lb/>
            strongly importuned me to be reconciled with this man. If <lb/>
            he said this believing him to be implicated in the charges <lb/>
            which have caused his ruin, and putting faith in the tale of <lb/>
            his accusers, he should not have said it even then; for a <lb/>
            friend, when he is thought to have committed crime, is pretty <lb/>
            well punished in losing your friendship for the future: penal <lb/>
            prosecution is left for aggrieved parties and for enemies. <lb/>
            However let Midias2 stand excused. But, if it appear that <lb/>

            die ten times over, or rather ten thousand times ? To prove <lb/>
            that what I say is true-that the day before he said all this <lb/>
            he had entered the house of Aristarchus and conversed with <lb/>
            him, and on the day after again (this, men of Athens, this is <lb/>

            against a man in misfortune, who had never wronged him, <lb/>
            (whether he was his friend I will not inquire,) and at that <lb/>
            very time he was asking him to effect a reconciliation between <lb/>
            himself and me; and he did so, and spent money, in order <lb/>
            that he might drive me as well as him into exile without <lb/>
            a cause.</p>
          <p>A practice such as this, a contrivance, 0 Athenians, to <lb/>
            involve people who seek just redress in still further calamities, <lb/>
            is not a thing for me to be vexed and indignant at, and for <lb/>
            the rest of you to disregard. Far otherwise. You should all <lb/>
            equally resent it, considering and observing, 0 Athenians, <lb/>
            that the poorest and weakest among us are most exposed to <lb/>
            oppression; while ruffians that have money can most readily <lb/>
            commit outrages, and, instead of being punished for their <lb/>
            misdeeds, hire persons to embarrass their accusers. You must <lb/>
            not overlook these things: you should consider that a man, <lb/>
            who by fear and intimidation prevents our obtaining satis­ <lb/>
            faction of him for our wrongs, in effect deprives us of the <lb/>
            common rights of speech and liberty. I perhaps have <lb/>
            repelled (another may repel) a false and malignant calumny, <lb/>
            and I have not been destroyed; but what will you the many <lb/>
            do, unless by public example you make it dreadful to all to <lb/>
            abuse their riches in such a way ? When a man has answered <lb/>
            and stood his trial upon the charges against him, then may be <lb/>
            avenge himself on those who attacked him wrongfully; and <lb/>
            even then,1 when he sees them committing wrong, he is not <lb/>
            to snatch them out of the way beforehand, not seek by false <lb/>
            accusations to escape from his own trial; nor ought he to be <lb/>
            vexed at suffering punishment, but careful from the beginning <lb/>
            not to misbehave himself.</p>

            a good deal I pass by, for it would not be very easy to tell all; <lb/>
            but thus the matter stands. In none of these proceedings <lb/>
            have I alone been wronged: but by the offences touching the <lb/>
            chorus my tribe, a tenth part of you, has been wronged as <lb/>
            well as myself; by his outrages to my person, and by his <lb/>
            machinations against me, the laws are wronged, to which <lb/>
            every one of you is indebted for security; and by all these <lb/>
            things the God, whose choir-master I was, is wronged, and <lb/>

            take vengeance accordingly, and regard any persons who sup­ <lb/>

          <p>If Midias, 0 Athenians, had behaved himself on other <lb/>
            occasions with discretion and decency, if he had wronged no <lb/>
            other citizen, and been thus intemperate and violent with me <lb/>
            alone, I should have looked upon it as my peculiar mis­ <lb/>
            fortune, and been afraid that, by showing the moderation and <lb/>
            mildness of his general conduct, he might evade punishment <lb/>
            for his outrage on me. As it is however, the wrongs which <lb/>
            divers of you have sustained from him are so many in <lb/>
            number and of such a character, that I am relieved from this <lb/>
            apprehension, and have now a different fear, that, when you <lb/>
            hear of so many cruel injuries done by him to other men, it <lb/>
            may occur to you to reason in this sort of way: " How have <lb/>
            you been worse injured than any one of the rest, that you <lb/>
            take it thus to heart?" It would be impossible for me to <lb/>
            tell you of all his doings, nor could you endure to listen to <lb/>
            them: indeed, if both our measures of water, all mine and <lb/>
            all his, were added to what is left, it would not be sufficient. <lb/>
            However I will mention the most striking and flagrant; or <lb/>
            rather I will do this-read to you all the memoranda, as <lb/>
            I have set them down for myself; and I will begin with <lb/>
            whichever you would like to hear first, then go to another, <lb/>
            and so on with the remainder, as long as you choose to listen. <lb/>
            There is a vast variety of them, a multitude of outrages, <lb/>
            tricks upon relations, impieties to the gods; and. there is <lb/>
            hardly a place 1 in which you will not find many acts worthy <lb/>

            from Chalets, accusing them and saying, that the troop sent <lb/>
            out was a disgrace to the republic: and you remember the <lb/>
            abuse which he lavished upon Cratinus about the affair, when <lb/>
            he was going (as I am informed) to assist him. How wicked <lb/>

            expedition to Eubcea started with Phocion in the early part of Anthe­ <lb/>
            sterion (February). Phocion being in danger at Tamynæ, sends intelli­ <lb/>
            gence of it to Athens ; and the Council resolve to send reinforcements, <lb/>
            including all the remainder of the cavalry. While these were pre­ <lb/>

            are postponed till after the celebration of the great Dionysia in Ela­ <lb/>

            Demosthenes accompanying the infantry, and Midias, who was hipparch, <lb/>
            leading the cavalry; but he went with them only as far as Argura, <lb/>
            from which he returned to join the ship of which he was trierarch. <lb/>
            The same horsemen that went to Eubœa with Midias were afterwards <lb/>
            sent to Olynthus, and Midias denounced them as a wretched troop, <lb/>

            the heavy-armed; for we did not cross over to the same place <lb/>
            as the horsemen. Then, because Archetion or some one else <lb/>
            joked you about it, must you bully them all ? If you did, <lb/>
            Midias, what the horsemen of your troop say you did, and <lb/>
            what you complained of their representing, you were re­ <lb/>
            proached with justice; for you were injuring and disgracing <lb/>
            the troop and the people here and the whole republic. If it <lb/>
            was pure scandal made up by some persons against you, and <lb/>
            the rest of the soldiers, instead of reproving them, were <lb/>
            delighted at your mortification, it is plain that, from your <lb/>
            general life, they believed you to be deserving of such re­ <lb/>
            proach. You ought therefore to behave yourself with more <lb/>
            decency, not to run down them. But you threaten all, bully <lb/>
            all: you expect others to look after your pleasure, but never <lb/>
            look to do yourself what will give no pain to others. And the <lb/>
            most shocking thing of all, the most striking mark of inso­ <lb/>
            lence, in my opinion, is this-that you should come forward, <lb/>
            you abominable fellow, and denounce such a number of men <lb/>
            in a body ! Any one but you would have shuddered at the <lb/>
            thought of it.</p>
          <p>I observe, men of the jury, in the case of other people who <lb/>
            are brought to trial, that the offences laid to their charge are <lb/>
            one or two, while they have arguments of this sort in abun­ <lb/>

            terrible: for where a rogue and a bully is supported by wealth <lb/>
            and power, it is a wall of defence against any attack. Let <lb/>
            Midias be stripped of his possessions, and most likely he will <lb/>
            not play the bully: if he should, he will be less regarded <lb/>

            no purpose then, and be punished for any misbehaviour, like <lb/>
            the rest of us. Now, it seems, Polyeuctus and Timocrates <lb/>
            and the ragamuffin Euctemon are his body-guard: these are <lb/>
            a sort of mercenaries he keeps about him, and others also <lb/>
            besides them, a confederate band of witnesses, who never <lb/>
            trouble you openly, but by simply nodding their heads affirm <lb/>
            any lie with perfect ease. By the Powers, I don't believe <lb/>
            they get any good from him; but they are wonderful people, <lb/>
            0 Athenians, for-making up to the rich, and attending on <lb/>
            them and giving evidence. All this, I take it, is formidable <lb/>
            to any of you that live by yourselves as well as you can; and <lb/>
            therefore it is you assemble together, that, where taken sepa­ <lb/>
            rately you are overmatched by any one, either in friends or <lb/>
            riches or anything else, you may collectively be more than a <lb/>
            match for him, and put a stop to his insolence.</p>
          <p>Possibly however an argument of this sort will be ad­ <lb/>
            dressed to you: "Why did such a person, after sustaining <lb/>
            such and such an injury, never demand satisfaction of me ? <lb/>
            or why"—naming perhaps some other aggrieved party. I <lb/>
            imagine you all know the reasons why people forbear to seek <lb/>
            redress: there is want of leisure, love of quiet, inability to <lb/>
            speak, lack of means, and a thousand other causes. Yet I <lb/>
            conceive, it does not become the defendant to allege this now, <lb/>
            but to show that he is not guilty of what I charge him with: <lb/>
            if he cannot show it, he deserves to perish all the more; for <lb/>
            if he is so mighty a person as to be able to do these things, <lb/>
            and prevent each of us in turn from calling him to account, <lb/>
            you ought all, now you have him in your power, to take <lb/>
            common vengeance upon him, as a common enemy of the <lb/>
            state.</p>

            ethenes. It was a trick, by which he compelled Agatharchus to paint <lb/>
            his own house and to break another engagement. </note><note type="footnote"> The assault upon Taureas was like that of Midias upon Demosthenes, <lb/>
            except that it does not appear to have been malicious. Andocides says <lb/>
            that, notwithstanding the displeasure of the spectators, the umpires <lb/>
            out of fear or favour gave Alcibiades the prize. </note><note type="footnote"> A remarkable instance of his setting the laws at defiance is men­ <lb/>
            tioned in Athenæus, he. 407. Hegemon the Thasian, a famous composer <lb/>
            of parodies, having been summoned to appear to an action, applied to <lb/>
            Alcibiades for assistance. Alcibiades went with him to the record <lb/>
            office, kept in the temple of Cybele, and with his own hand erased the <lb/>
            plaint which had been lodged against his friend. The plaintiff was so <lb/>
            frightened that he abandoned the cause, and the officials, who should <lb/>
            have prosecuted him, hushed the matter up. </note><note type="footnote"> At the Olympic festival, where he gained so many prizes and made <lb/>
            so splendid an appearance, he appropriated to his own use a chariot <lb/>
            and pair belonging to Diomed, an Athenian, availing himself of his <lb/>
            influence with the Elean managers to accomplish such a piece of <lb/>
            injustice. </note><note type="footnote"> His mad freaks soon became notorious over all Greece. Some one <lb/>
            observed that Sparta could not have borne two Lysanders, nor Athens <lb/>
            two Alcibiades. (Athenaeus, xii. 535.) Unhappily he did not confine <lb/>
            himself to practical jokes upon individuals, but played political tricks <lb/>
            that were fatal to his country. Timon the misanthrope is said to have <lb/>
            been delighted at seeing his aptitude for mischief. Shakspeare, who <lb/>
            found this in Plutarch, has improved on it in his Timon of Athens. <lb/>
            Perhaps there is no better description (in a short compass) of the tem­ <lb/>
            per and character of Alcibiades than what is contained in the lines of <lb/>
            Aristophanes, Ranæ, 1431. </note><figure type="illustration">

              ancestors dealt with him, when he thought proper to be <lb/>
              offensive and insolent. It is assuredly from no wish to liken <lb/>
              Midias to Alcibiades that I mention the case; I am not so <lb/>
              silly or so stupid; but to make you see and understand, men <lb/>
              of Athens, that there is nothing, there can be nothing, neither <lb/>
              birth nor riches nor power, which the mass of the people <lb/>
              ought to tolerate, if accompanied with insolence. Alcibiades, <lb/>
              0 Athenians, is said to have been by his father's side of the <lb/>
              race of the Alcmaeonids; who, as we are told, were driven <lb/>
              into exile by the tyrants for espousing the democratic party, <lb/>
              and, having borrowed money from Delphi, liberated the com­ <lb/>
              monwealth and expelled the sons of Pisistratus. 1 By his <lb/>
              mother's side he came from Hipponicus and that house which <lb/>
              boasts of many signal obligations conferred upon the people. <lb/>
              And, besides having these things in his favour, he himself <lb/>
              took arms for the people, twice in Samos and a third time in <lb/>
              Athens,2 displaying loyalty to his country not by. gifts of <lb/>
              money or words, but by hazarding his life. Nay more; he <lb/>
              had been competitor in the chariot-race at Olympia, and had <lb/>
              won victories and garlands; and he was considered (as they <lb/>
              tell us) to be of all men the ablest general and most eloquent <lb/>
              speaker. Nevertheless your ancestors, his contemporaries, <lb/>
              did not for any of these reasons allow him to insult them, <lb/>
              but banished and exiled him from the city; and the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
              monians being then powerful, they submitted to have Decelea <lb/>
              fortified against them, and to have their ships taken, and to <lb/>
              the last extremities, deeming it more honourable to suffer <lb/>
              anything by compulsion than consent to be treated with <lb/>
              indignity. Yet what outrage did Alcibiades ever commit <lb/>
              equal to that which Midias is now proved to be guilty of? <lb/>
              He slapped Taureas on the cheek, while discharging the <lb/>
              choragic office. Granted. But it was an act done by one <lb/>
              choir-master to another; and he was not then violating the <lb/>
              present law, for it had not then been enacted. He imprisoned <lb/>
              Agatharchus the painter, so they say; but he had caught <lb/>
              him in a trespass, we are told; and it is not fair even to men­ <lb/>
              tion it to his reproach. He mutilated the busts of Hermes. <lb/>
              All acts of impiety, I conceive, should be visited with the <note type="footnote"> 1 See more particularly Herodotus vi. 123, &amp;c. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 When he marched with the Athenians to Eleusis, and enabled <lb/>

              same anger; and can the total destruction of a sacred robe <lb/>
              differ from the mutilation of Hermes' busts ? Of that offence <lb/>
              however Midias stands convicted. Let us compare the cases.l <lb/>
              Who is Midias, and who are they to whom he so demeans <lb/>
              himself? Rest assured, men of the jury, that (besides being <lb/>
              dishonourable) it would be unlawful and unrighteous in you, <lb/>
              the descendants of such a people, when you have got in your <lb/>
              power a rascally and outrageous bully, a mere nobody and <lb/>
              the son of nobody, 2 to accord him either mercy or pity or <lb/>
              favour. Why should you? For his services as general? <lb/>
              Why, even as an individual soldier he is not good for any­ <lb/>
              thing, much less as a leader of others. But for his speeches ? <lb/>
              In none did he ever utter a word for the public good, but he <lb/>
              abuses every one's private character. For his family's sake <lb/>
              peradventure. And which of you is ignorant of his mys­ <lb/>
              terious birth, resembling what one sees in a tragedy? Two of <lb/>
              the most opposite things have befallen him. His real mother <lb/>
              who brought him forth was the most sensible of human <lb/>
              beings, while she that passed for his mother, she that took him <lb/>
              supposititiously, was the most foolish of all women. Why ? <lb/>
              Because the one sold him as soon as he was born; the other, <lb/>
              when she might have purchased a better for the same price, <lb/>
              bought Midias. And hence it is, that having obtained advan­ <lb/>
              tages to which he was not entitled, having found a country <lb/>
              which of all states is reputed to be the most constitutionally <lb/>
              governed, he is able in, no way, as it seems, to bear his for­ <lb/>
              tune or to make use of it. His nature, essentially barbarous <lb/>
              and hateful to the Gods, drags him violently on, and makes it <lb/>
              evident that he treats his present privileges as if they were <lb/>
              not his own; which indeed is the case. <note type="footnote"> 1 He contrasts the case of Midias with that of Alcibiades. The <lb/>
              argument was simple and obvious. " The Athenians of former days <lb/>
              punished Alcibiades for his misbehaviour, notwithstanding his high <lb/>
              birth and various merits. You, the descendants of those Athenians, <lb/>
              would be bound in like manner to punish Midias, even if he had all <lb/>
              the good qualities of Alcibiades. But when you see that, instead of being <lb/>
              well-born, brave, generous, and eloquent, he is an utterly contemptible <lb/>
              person in all respects, it would be monstrous if you showed him any <lb/>
              mercy after taking such daring liberties with his fellow-countrymen." <lb/>
              The orator, not choosing to follow the argument step by step, breaks at <lb/>
              once into the conclusion. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μηδένα μηδαμόθεν</foreign>. Auger and Pabst follow Wolf's interpretation, <lb/>

          <p>The performances of this odious wretch having been such <lb/>
            as I have enumerated, some of his intimate friends, men of <lb/>
            the jury, came advising me to withdraw and compromise the <lb/>
            cause; not succeeding with me, they never dared to say that <lb/>
            he had not committed gross offences and merited the heaviest <lb/>
            punishment, but took this ground, that he had already been <lb/>
            found guilty and condemned. " What penalty," said they, <lb/>
            " do you expect the court will inflict upon him ? Don't you <lb/>
            see that he is wealthy, and will speak of trierarchies and <lb/>
            official services ?Mind that he doesn't beg himself off by it <lb/>
            and laugh at you, paying much less to the state than what <lb/>
            he offers you." Now, in the first place, I don't believe an <lb/>
            Athenian jury capable of anything mean, nor imagine they <lb/>
            will sentence him to any lighter penalty than one by which <lb/>
            his insolence will be checked; that is, either death, or at <lb/>
            least, confiscation of his property. In the next place, as to <lb/>
            his official services, his trierarchies and such matters, I will <lb/>
            tell you what I think. If this be to serve public offices, to <lb/>
            say before you in all the assemblies and on every occasion, <lb/>
            " We are the people who serve public offices, we are the men <lb/>
            who advance the taxes, we are the wealthy class "-if to talk <lb/>
            in this style is to serve public offices, I acknowledge that <lb/>
            Midias is the most magnificent person in the state; for surely <lb/>
            his harsh and Unfeeling way of talking about these things <lb/>
            grates upon our ears in every assembly. But if you want to <lb/>
            know what official services he really performs, I will tell you; <lb/>
            and mark how fair a test I will bring him to, comparing him <lb/>
            with myself.</p>
          <p>The defendant, 0 Athenians, being about fifty years of <lb/>
            age or somewhat less, has served no more public offices than <lb/>
            I have, who am thirty-two. And I served the trierarchy, <lb/>
            immediately after quitting boy's estate, at that period when <lb/>
            we were two together in command, and when we defrayed the <lb/>
            whole cost out of our private purses, and manned the ships <lb/>
            ourselves. 1 The defendant, when he was at the age which <lb/>
            I am now, had not begun to serve offices; he has only entered <lb/>
            upon the duty since you have established the company of <lb/>
            twelve hundred,2 from whom these men collect a talent, and <lb/>
            for that sum procure a deputy-captain; then the state finds <note type="footnote"> 1 See Böckh's Public Economy of Athens, Transl. ii. 333. </note><note type="footnote">2 Ibid. ii. 341. And see the first volume of this work, Appendix V. </note> <lb/>

            the crews and provides tackle: so the result is, that some of <lb/>
            them really spend nothing, and, while they appear to have <lb/>
            served an office, have enjoyed exemption from all other <lb/>
            services.</p>
          <p>Well, but what else? He has once furnished a tragic <lb/>
            chorus; I have furnished a chorus of flute-players: and that <lb/>
            the expense of this greatly exceeds the cost of the other, every <lb/>
            one must be aware. And my service now was voluntary; his <lb/>
            then was forced upon him by a tender of exchange, for which <lb/>
            surely he can deserve no thanks. What besides ? I have <lb/>
            feasted my tribe, and furnished a chorus at the Panathenæa: <lb/>
            he has done neither. I was ten years director of one of your <lb/>
            tax-boards, paying as much as Phormio and Lysithides and <lb/>
            Callæschrus and the wealthiest people, not from property in <lb/>
            my possession, (for I had been robbed by my guardians,) but , <lb/>
            from the reputation of what my father left me and what <lb/>
            I ought to have obtained on coming of age.1 Thus have I <lb/>
            dealt by the people: how has Midias ? Not even to this day <lb/>
            has he been director of a board of taxes, though he never was <lb/>
            deprived by any one of the least part of his inheritance, but <lb/>
            received from his father a large estate. Where then are his <lb/>
            grand doings ? Where are his official services and magnificent <lb/>
            outlays ? I cannot see, unless one looks at these things-he <lb/>
            has built a house at Eleusis so large as to darken all in the <lb/>
            place; and he carries his wife to the mysteries, or anywhere <lb/>
            else that she likes, with his white pair from Sicyon; 2 and he <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δοκιμασθέντα</foreign>. " After passing that examination, as to birth, &amp;c., <lb/>

            will not take long to tell from the beginning.</p>
          <p>You had voluntary contributions first for the expedition to <lb/>
            Eubœa. 1 Midias was not in those, but I was; and my col­ <lb/>
            league in the trierarchy was Philinus the son of Nicostratus. <lb/>
            A second time you had them for Olynthus.2 Midias was not <lb/>
            in those either: yet surely a man of public spirit should <lb/>
            come forward upon every occasion. Thirdly, there have been <lb/>
            these last voluntary contributions. Here he was a contri­ <lb/>
            butor. How ? When offers of contribution were made in the <lb/>
            council, he was present and made no offer. But when news <lb/>
            was brought that the troops at Tamynæ were surrounded, and <lb/>
            the council passed a resolution to send out all the remaining <lb/>
            horsemen, including the defendant, he, dreading the campaign, <lb/>
            came forward at the ensuing assembly, before even the com­ <lb/>
            mittee-men had taken their seats, and announced himself <lb/>
            a contributor. That his object was to shirk the campaign, <lb/>
            and not to be generous, is too clear even for him to deny. <lb/>
            How does that appear ? By his subsequent conduct: for in <lb/>
            the first instance, when it was determined after some dis­ <lb/>
            cussion in the assembly, that the reinforcement of horse was <lb/>
            not then necessary, and the people had cooled about the <lb/>
            expedition, he did not go on board the ship which he had <lb/>
            given, but sent out the resident alien Pamphilus, the Egyptian, <lb/>
            while he himself stayed at home and did those acts at the <note type="footnote"> until this was done, the empty hulk was of no service. Böckh how­ <lb/>

            when Phocion the general sent for the cavalry from Argura1 <lb/>
            to take their turn of service, and he was caught in his <note type="footnote"> 1 Reiske thinks that the words TOuS '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αργούρας ἱππέμς</foreign>denote horse­ <lb/>
            men who had served at Argura and returned to Athens. Buttmann <lb/>
            adopts the same view. Yet, according to the common rule of construc­ <lb/>
            tion, these words should be understood of horsemen who were at Argura <lb/>
            when Phocion sent for them. And it by no means appears from other <lb/>
            parts of the oration, that these horsemen had ever returned from Argura. <lb/>
            to Athens. Looking at the various passages in which the circumstances <lb/>
            of the Eubœan campaign are referred to by Demosthenes, I am inclined <lb/>
            to think that Midias and his troop of horse went only once to Eubœa, <lb/>
            and not twice, as Reiske supposes. It appears from the beginning of <lb/>
            this page (567), that just before the battle of Tamynæ Midias and all <lb/>
            the cavalry not with Phocion's army (TOVS <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπολοίπους ἱππέας</foreign>) were at <lb/>
            Athens. The Council order them to be sent out, and Midias (being <lb/>
            one of the two hipparchs) would have had to go with them; to avoid <lb/>
            which (according to Demosthenes) he volunteered to be trierarch. The <lb/>
            Assembly countermand the order of Council; and Midias, to escape <lb/>
            personal service of the trierarchy, sends out Pamphilus as his deputy. <lb/>
            After the Dionysia however a troop of horse is despatched to Argura, <lb/>
            perhaps to take possession of that place, which fell into the hands of <lb/>
            the Athenians through the victory of Tamynæ. Midias accompanies <lb/>
            them. He was not able to avoid it, his ship having sailed, and his name <lb/>
            having been drawn for the service. (P. 558: <foreign xml:lang="grc">τω̑ν συστ</foreign> parr<foreign xml:lang="grc">ευσαμένων</foreign> </note> <figure type="illustration">

              before the Dionysia, (this may perhaps be implied by the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐκ <lb/>

              for that very reason indicted by Euctemon. Phocion, still carrying on <lb/>
              military operations, and desiring to relieve the horse who had served <lb/>
              at Tamynæ, or to exchange them for a more efficient troop, sent for <lb/>
              those stationed at Argura. Midias, instead of marching with them, <lb/>
              went to take command of his ship, which had helped to convoy the <lb/>
              troops and was then lying in some port of Euboca, perhaps Chalcis. <lb/>

              fleet afterwards assembled at Styra, a port of Eubœa to the south of <lb/>
              Eretria, from which it convoyed the troops on their return to Athens; <lb/>

              manoeuvring, then this dastardly wretch, quitting the post <lb/>
              assigned to him, went off to his ship, and declined to serve <lb/>
              with those horsemen whom he thought proper to command <lb/>
              at Athens. Had there been any danger by sea, it is plain he <lb/>
              would have gone off to the land. Not thus did Niceratus <lb/>
              act,1 the son of Nicias, the beloved, the childless,2 the utterly <lb/>
              feeble in body: not thus Euctemon the son of Asion, nor <lb/>
              Euthydemus the son of Stratocles. They volunteered each of <lb/>
              them to give a trireme, but did not run away from the cam­ <lb/>
              paign: their ships they presented in sailing condition as a <lb/>
              free boon to the commonwealth, but they resolved to do per­ <lb/>
              sonal service in the place where the law commanded them. <lb/>
              Not so the hipparch Midias: he deserted the post assigned <lb/>
              him by the laws, and will reckon that as an obligation, for <lb/>
              which he ought to render an account to the state. Such <lb/>
              a trierarchy as this, by heavens ! what should it be called ?— <lb/>
              a farming of taxes and a two-per-cent,3 a desertion of post, <lb/>
              a running away from service, and the like-or an act of <lb/>
              liberality ? Having no other way to get himself exempted <lb/>
              from serving with the cavalry, Midias has discovered this new <lb/>
              sort of two-per-cent for it. For here again-when all the other <lb/>
              volunteer trierarchs were convoying you, at the time when <lb/>
              you sailed home from Styra, he alone took no part in the <lb/>
              convoy; but disregarding you, he was getting in stakes and <lb/>
              sheep and planks for his private residence and wood for his <lb/>
              silver-works: and the trierarchy has been a lucrative job to <lb/>
              this despicable fellow, not a performance of duty. As to the <lb/>
              truth of these statements-though indeed most of them are <lb/>
              within your own knowledge—I will call witnesses before <lb/>
              you. <note type="footnote"> 1 The grandson of that Niceratus who perished under the Thirty <lb/>

            Niceratus of Acherdus, Euctemon of Sphettus, at the time <lb/>
            when we sailed back from Styra with our whole fleet, were <lb/>
            ourselves trierarchs, as also was Midias, the party now prose­ <lb/>
            cuted by Demosthenes, for whom we are witnesses. The <lb/>
            whole fleet was sailing in order, and the trierarchs had com­ <lb/>
            mand not to separate until their arrival, when Midias stayed <lb/>
            behind the fleet, loaded his ship with wood and stakes and <lb/>
            sheep and some other things, and arrived in Piræus by him­ <lb/>
            self two days after, and did not assist the other trierarchs in <lb/>
            bringing the fleet into port."</p>
          <p>If his deeds and services, men of Athens, were really what <lb/>
            he will tell you and brag of presently, and not what I show <lb/>
            them to have been, surely even then he would not be entitled <lb/>
            by his services to escape the punishment of his insolence. I <lb/>
            know that many persons have conferred benefits upon you— <lb/>
            not in the style of these services performed by Midias—some <lb/>
            by victories at sea, some by capture of cities, others by the <lb/>
            erection of glorious trophies for the commonwealth; yet to <lb/>
            none of them have you ever granted, nor would you grant, <lb/>
            such a privilege as this, for each to insult his private enemies <lb/>
            when he pleases and as he may. Even Harmodius and Ari­ <lb/>
            stogiton had no such liberty, though on them you have <lb/>
            bestowed the highest honours for the highest deserts; nor <lb/>
            would you have endured that any one should add to the pillar, <lb/>
            " and it shall be lawful for them to insult whom they please." <lb/>
            For on this very account they received their other honours, <lb/>
            because they had put the insolent down.</p>
          <p>That he has obtained from you, men of Athens, not only <lb/>
            the full recompense of his own official services, (which would <lb/>
            have been very small), but one ample enough even for the <lb/>
            greatest, I will proceed to show, lest you should imagine that <lb/>
            you owe anything to this despicable fellow. You, Athenians, <lb/>
            elected him, such as he is, to be steward of the Paralus,2 and <lb/>
            again to be commander of horse, though he is not able to ride <note type="footnote"> 1 Probably the same Pamphilus whom MEdias deputed at first to <lb/>

            tendent of the Mysteries1 formerly, and sacrificer, and pur­ <lb/>
            chaser of victims,2 and the like. Then, by the Gods ! do you <lb/>
            consider it a slight boon and recompense, that the meanness <lb/>
            and cowardliness and, baseness of his nature should be mended <lb/>
            by your honours and dignities and appointments ? Only take <lb/>
            these things from him—" I have been commander of horse: <lb/>
            I have been steward of the Paralus"—and what else is he <lb/>
            good for ? Surely you know that, when he became steward <lb/>
            of the Paralus, he plundered the Cyzicenes of more than five <lb/>
            talents, and, to escape punishment for it, he pushed about <lb/>
            and plagued the men in every way, and made the law-treaty <lb/>
            a nullity, whereby he has set their state at enmity with ours, <lb/>
            and kept the money to himself; a and that, since he has been <lb/>
            created hipparch, he has ruined your cavalry, passing such <lb/>
            laws as he himself afterwards denied having passed. And <lb/>
            being steward of the ParIus, at the time when you made <lb/>
            your expedition against the Thebans to Eubœa, though he <lb/>
            was commissioned to lay out twelve talents of the public <lb/>
            money, and had your orders to sail and convoy the troops, he <lb/>
            never executed his duty, but arrived after the truce which <lb/>
            Diocles concluded with the Thebans; and then he was beaten <lb/>
            in sailing by one of the common galleys; so well, had he <lb/>
            equipped the sacred galley. Again, as hipparch-—what think <lb/>
            ye of the rest?—even a horse, a horse this man of wealth and <lb/>
            splendour could not make up his mind to purchase, but con­ <lb/>
            ducted the processions on another man's horse, one belonging <lb/>
            to Philomelus of Pæania.; and this all the horsemen know. <lb/>

            what they had done to deserve it, that you may contrast <lb/>
            their cases with the acts of the defendant.</p>
          <p>First then-that I may begin with the last conviction­ <lb/>
            the people resolved that Evander the Thespian had com­ <lb/>
            mitted a contempt of the Mysteries, upon a complaint against <lb/>
            him by Menippus a Carian. The law concerning the Mys­ <lb/>
            teries is the same as this concerning the Dionysia, and it was <lb/>
            passed subsequently to this. What, men of Athens, had <lb/>
            Evander done to call for your condemnation ? Listen. He <lb/>
            had obtained a verdict against Menippus in a mercantile <lb/>
            caused and being unable (as he said) to catch him before, he <lb/>
            seized his person while staying here at the Mysteries. The <lb/>
            people condemned him on this account, and there was nothing <lb/>
            further in the case; and when he came into court, you were <lb/>
            disposed to punish him with death, but, the complainant <lb/>
            coming to terms, you compelled him to forego the whole of <lb/>
            the judgment which he had formerly recovered, amounting to <lb/>
            two talents, and to pay such damages as the man computed <lb/>
            he had sustained by stopping to prosecute. Here was one <lb/>
            person, out of a private affair attended with no insult, thus <lb/>
            heavily mulcted for the simple breach of the law; and pro­ <lb/>
            perly : for this is what you are bound to maintain, the laws, <lb/>
            your oath: these you jurors of the day receive as a deposit <lb/>
            from your countrymen, to be kept safe for all who come to <lb/>
            you with justice on their side.</p>
          <p>Another person was considered by you to have profaned <lb/>
            the Dionysia, and you passed a decree against him, though he <lb/>
            was assessor to his son, the Archon, because he laid hands on <lb/>
            a man taking a wrong seat, and turned him out of the <lb/>
            theatre. He was father of the esteemed Chariclides, who <lb/>
            held the office of Archon. And the complainant, in your <lb/>
            opinion, had a good and strong point to urge—" If, man, <lb/>
            I was taking a wrong seat, if I was disobeying the pro­ <lb/>
            clamations, as you say I was, what power have you by the <note type="footnote"> 1 Certain actions founded upon written contracts between merchants <lb/>

            law ? what has the Archon himself ? To desire the officers to <lb/>
            turn me out. Am I still refractory ? You may impose a fine­ <lb/>
            anything but lay your own hands upon me: for the laws have <lb/>
            taken great pains to prevent people suffering personal out­ <lb/>
            rage." Thus he argued, and you passed a condemnatory vote; <lb/>
            but the party never came into court, for he died first.</p>
          <p>There was another man whom the whole assembly pro­ <lb/>

            when he came before the jury, they sentenced him to death. <lb/>
            I mean Ctesicles. Why did they so? Because he carried <lb/>
            a whip in the procession, and, when he was drunk, lashed <lb/>
            a man with whom he had had a quarrel. It was thought that <lb/>
            he gave the blow maliciously, and not under the influence of <lb/>
            wine; that he used the pretext of holiday-time and drunken­ <lb/>
            ness to commit a tortious act, and treat a freeman as <lb/>
            a slave.</p>
          <p>All these persons, 0 Athenians, (one of whom is shown to <lb/>
            have forfeited a verdict which he had recovered, another to <lb/>
            have been punished with death,) had committed, as I am sure <lb/>
            you will all agree, far less heinous offences than Midias. He, <lb/>
            neither walking in a procession, nor having recovered a judg­ <lb/>
            ment, nor being assessor, nor having any other excuse than <lb/>
            insolence, has done worse things than any of them. I will <lb/>
            pass by those cases. But Pyrrhus, 0 Athenians, the Eteo­ <lb/>
            butad,l had an information laid against him for acting as <lb/>
            juryman while he was a public debtor, and some of you <lb/>
            thought that he should be capitally punished; and he was <lb/>
            convicted before you, and has suffered death. Yet the gain <lb/>
            which he attempted to make was not to gratify insolence, but <lb/>
            to satisfy want. And many more could I mention, who have <lb/>
            either lost their lives or been disfranchised for much slighter <lb/>
            causes than these. You, men of Athens, imposed on Smicron <lb/>
            a penalty of ten talents, and the same upon Sciton, for pro­ <lb/>
            posing (as you thought) illegal measures: and you had no <note type="footnote"> 1 The Butadæ were an Athenian family (<foreign xml:lang="grc">γένος</foreign>) of great antiquity, <lb/>
            from whom was chosen the priestess of '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αθήνη Πολιάς</foreign>. When Attica <lb/>
            was divided into townships, they gave their name to one which in­ <lb/>
            cluded them with other families. It was called Butea, and its members <lb/>
            Butadæ. The ancient family then, to distinguish themselves from the <lb/>
            members of the township, assumed the name of Eteobutadæ, the true <lb/>

            pity either for their children or their friends or their rela­ <lb/>
            tives, or for any persons who attended to support them. Do <lb/>
            not let it appear then, that you are so angry when people <lb/>
            move illegal decrees, but, when they break the law by acts <lb/>
            instead of words, you are indulgent. For no speech or <lb/>
            language can be so grievous to the multitude, as the be­ <lb/>
            haviour of a man who bullies every one that meets him. Do <lb/>
            not, 0 Athenians, give such a sample of your character as <lb/>
            this, that, if you find an inoffensive man of the people doing <lb/>
            wrong, you will neither pity nor pardon, but put to death or <lb/>
            disfranchise him, while, if any rich man plays the bully, <lb/>
            you will have mercy. Do not, I entreat you : it would not <lb/>
            be just: but let it be seen that your displeasure is in all <lb/>
            cases the same.</p>
          <p>There is one point which I deem as important as anything <lb/>
            yet stated: I will just mention it with some brief remarks, <lb/>
            and then sit down. The mildness of your disposition, men <lb/>
            of Athens, is a great help and advantage to all the doers of <lb/>
            wrong. That you should not allow the benefit of it to <lb/>
            Midias, I will convince you. I consider that all men pay <lb/>
            club-money1 to their own account during their lives, not <lb/>
            that only which there are people to collect and make up, but <lb/>
            a different sort. For example: there is one of us civil and <lb/>
            obliging and charitable; he is entitled to the like treatment <lb/>
            from all, if ever he falls into distress or trouble. Here is <lb/>
            another, impudent and overbearing, regarding people as <lb/>
            beggars or scum of the earth or nobodies: he deserves to be <lb/>
            repaid in the same coin that he has treated his neighbours to.2 <lb/>
            Just look fairly at the matter, and you will see that Midias <lb/>
            has paid club-money of the latter sort, not of the former.</p>
          <p>I know he will have his children and whine; he will talk <lb/>
            very humbly, shedding tears and making himself as piteous <lb/>
            as he can. Yet the more he humbles himself, the more <lb/>
            ought you to detest him, 0 Athenians. Why? Because, if the <lb/>
            outrageousness and violence of his past conduct arose out of <lb/>
            his inability to be humble, it would have been fair to make <note type="footnote"> 1 See ante, page 99, note 1. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Pabst: Hiergegen ist ein Anderer wie dieser anmassend und über. <lb/>

            some allowance for his temper and the accident which made <lb/>
            him what he is: but if he knows how to behave himself <lb/>
            properly when he likes, and has adopted a different lino of <lb/>
            conduct by choice, surely it is quite evident that, if he eludes <lb/>
            justice now, he will again become the same Midias that you <lb/>
            know him for. You must not listen to him then; you must <lb/>
            not let the present occasion, when he is playing the hypocrite, <lb/>
            have more weight and influence with you than the whole <lb/>
            past of which you have experience. I have no children; I <lb/>
            could not place them before me and weep and wail over my <lb/>
            ill-treatment. For this shall I, the sufferer of wrong, fare <lb/>
            worse with you than the doer of wrong? Heaven forbid! <lb/>
            When Midias having his children by him requests you to <lb/>
            give your votes to them, think that I am standing by <lb/>
            with the laws and the oath that you have sworn, conjuring <lb/>
            and entreating you all to vote in their favour. You ought <lb/>
            on many accounts to side with them rather than with the <lb/>
            defendant. For you have sworn, men of Athens, to obey the <lb/>
            laws; you share in equal rights through the laws; all the <lb/>
            blessings that you enjoy are owing to the laws, not to Midias <lb/>
            or the children of Midias.</p>
          <p>Perhaps he will say of me—" This man is an orator." Well: <lb/>
            if one who advises what he thinks for your good, without <lb/>
            being troublesome or intrusive, is an orator, I would not <lb/>
            refuse nor deny the name: but if an orator be what (to my <lb/>
            and to your knowledge) certain of our speakers are, impudent <lb/>
            fellows enriched at your expense, I can hardly be that; for I <lb/>
            have received nothing from you, but spent all my substance <lb/>
            upon you except a trifle; though, were I the vilest among them, <lb/>
            I should rather be prosecuted according to the laws than in­ <lb/>
            sulted in the performance of my official duty. Besides, there is <lb/>
            not one of the speakers who advocates my cause: and I don't <lb/>
            blame any of them; for I myself have never spoken a word <lb/>
            to you for any of their sakes, but resolved both in speech <lb/>
            and action to take that independent course which I deem for <lb/>
            your advantage. You will presently see all the orators <lb/>
            ranged on the side of the defendant. How then can he <lb/>
            fairly reproach me with the name of orator, when by men of <lb/>
            that description he expects himself to escape?</p>
          <p>Probably also he will say something of this kind-that all <lb/>
            my speech is considered and prepared. I admit, 0 Athenians, <lb/>
             <pb n="128"/>
            I will not deny that I have considered it, aye, and got it up <lb/>
            as well as I possibly could: I were a simpleton indeed, if, <lb/>
            having suffered and still suffering such injuries, I took no <lb/>
            pains about the mode of stating them to you. I maintain <lb/>
            however that Midias has composed my address : he that has <lb/>
            supplied the facts which the speech is about may most fairly <lb/>
            be deemed its author, not he who has only considered or <lb/>
            studied how to lay an honest case before you. This is what <lb/>
            I do, men of Athens; I myself confess it. Midias, it is <lb/>
            likely enough, has never in his life considered about anything <lb/>
            that was right: had it occurred to him to pay the slightest <lb/>
            regard to such things, he would not have erred from the path <lb/>
            of right so entirely.</p>
          <p>I fancy he will not scruple to accuse even the people and <lb/>
            the assembly, but will repeat now what he ventured to say on <lb/>
            his first arraignment; namely, that all who stayed at home <lb/>
            when they should have been on military service, and all who <lb/>
            had deserted the garrisons, took part in the assembly, and <lb/>
            those that voted against him were choristers and aliens and <lb/>
            persons of that sort. For he had reached such a pitch of <lb/>
            impudence, men of the jury, as all you that were present <lb/>
            know, that by railing and threatening, and looking at what­ <lb/>
            ever part of the assembly was clamorous for the moment, he <lb/>
            thought to strike the whole people with terror. I should <lb/>
            think therefore his tears now would look somewhat ridiculous. <lb/>
            How ? you pestilent creature! Can you ask these men to <lb/>
            pity your children or yourself, or to take an interest about you <lb/>
            -these men whom you have cast public shame upon ? Are <lb/>
            you to be a singular instance of a man, who in his life is so <lb/>
            conspicuous for overweening arrogance and pride, that even <lb/>
            strangers are offended when they observe his audacity, his <lb/>
            voice and gestures, his attendants, wealth, and insolence­ <lb/>
            but on his being brought to trial is immediately an object of <lb/>
            compassion? You would indeed be a person of wonderful <lb/>
            fortune,l or rather talent, if in so short a time you could <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μεγάλην ἂν ἀρχὴν εἲης εὑρηκώς</foreign>, according to Reiske and Buttmann, <lb/>

            attract to yourself two things of the most opposite natures, <lb/>
            disgust at your conduct, and pity for your artifices.1 Not a <lb/>
            particle of compassion on any account do you deserve, <lb/>
            but on the contrary, hatred and ill-will and indignation: that <lb/>
            is due to you for your conduct. But I revert to what I said, <lb/>
            that he will accuse the people and the assembly. When he <lb/>
            does this, bethink you, men of the jury, that he came to <lb/>
            you in the assembly and accused the horsemen who had <lb/>
            served with him, when they crossed over to Olynthus. Now <lb/>
            again, having stayed at home, he will accuse the people to <lb/>
            those who were out on service.2 Will you agree then, that, <lb/>
            whether you stay at home or go out, you are such as Midias <lb/>
            pronounces you to be, or rather that Midias is at all times <lb/>
            and places execrable and abominable? I think you will cha­ <lb/>
            racterise him thus! What can be said of a person, whom <lb/>
            neither cavalry soldiers nor colleagues in command nor <lb/>
            friends can endure? To me, by Jupiter and Apollo and <lb/>
            Minerva! (it shall be spoken, whether for my good or not,3) <lb/>
            when he went about with the story that I had withdrawn, it <lb/>
            was plain that some of his most familiar acquaintances were <lb/>
            annoyed. And by Jupiter, there is much excuse for them; <lb/>
            for the man is intolerable : he alone is rich, he alone is able <lb/>
            to speak; all people to him are beggars, scum of the earth, <lb/>
            not human beings.</p>
          <p>He that bears himself so insolently-what do you think <lb/>
            he'll do, if he is acquitted now ? I'll tell you how you may <lb/>
            judge-By the evidence which he has furnished since the <lb/>
            popular sentence. For what man, after being declared guilty <lb/>
            by the people, guilty too of profaning the festival, though <lb/>

            to be alarmed at the possibility of their taking offence. Thus Auger: <lb/>

            would not have held down his head 1 and behaved himself, <lb/>
            with decency, during the interval before his trial at least, if <lb/>
            not ever after ? Any one would have done so: but not <lb/>
            Midias. He ever since that day has been talking, railing, <lb/>
            and bawling. Is there an election coming on ? Midias of <lb/>
            Anagyrus is a candidate. He is the state-friend of Plutarch; <lb/>
            he knows the secrets; the city does not contain him. And <lb/>
            it is plain he does all this only to made a parade of himself­ <lb/>
            " I have suffered nothing by the popular sentence: I have <lb/>
            no fear or dread of the coming trial!" Does not a man who <lb/>
            thinks it disgraceful to fear you, 0 Athenians, and a <lb/>
            fine thing to brave you, deserve to perish ten times over? <lb/>
            He fancies you will not know how to deal with him. Rich, <lb/>
            bold, conceited, impudent, loud in voice, violent in act ; <lb/>
            where will you catch him, if he escapes you now ?</p>
          <p>For my part, I think that for the speeches he makes in <lb/>
            every assembly and the occasions on which he makes them, <lb/>
            if for nothing else, he merits the severest punishment. You <lb/>
            must be aware, that if any good news is brought to Athens, <lb/>
            of a nature that is cheering to all, Midias never shows him­ <lb/>
            self among those who congratulate or rejoice with the people:: <lb/>
            but if there be any bad tidings, unwelcome to all the rest, <lb/>
            he starts up directly to harangue you, jumping at the oppor­ <lb/>
            tunity, and profiting by the silence which you maintain under <lb/>
            your affliction. " You are such a people, 0 Athenians: <lb/>
            you perform no military service, you don't choose to pay' <lb/>
            taxes. Is it a wonder then that your affairs go badly? Do <lb/>
            you suppose I'll pay taxes for you, and you spend the money ? <lb/>
            Do you suppose I'll furnish galleys, and you not go on board ?" <lb/>
            Thus scornfully does he express himself, displaying, when, <lb/>
            occasion offers, that bitterness and malevolence of spirit, <lb/>
            which, go where he will, he secretly cherishes against tho <lb/>
            common people. You, Athenians, must do the. same now <lb/>
            and when he tries to wheedle you out of your verdict by <lb/>
            tears and lamentations and entreaties, answer him thus— <lb/>
            " You, are such a person, Midias: you are a bully, and won't- <lb/>
            keep your hands to yourself. Is it a wonder then that you <lb/>
            should perish like a wretch as you are ? Do you imagine <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Οὐκ ἂν κατέδυ</foreign>. Auger: " ne s'enfermeroit pas dans sa maison. <lb/>

            that we shall take blows, and you give them? or that we <lb/>

          <p>And the speakers come to his aid, by the Gods, not so <lb/>
            much to benefit him, as to annoy me, on account of the <lb/>
            private quarrel which this man,1 whether I allow it or not, <lb/>
            declares he has had with me, and persists in declaring without <lb/>
            reason. Truly there is a risk of too much prosperity making <lb/>
            people offensive sometimes. For when I, in spite of ill-usage, <lb/>
            admit not this man to be my enemy, but he will not let me <lb/>
            alone, though I let him ; when he opposes me in contests with <lb/>
            other men, and will now get up and ask you to exclude me <lb/>
            from the common protection of the laws; can it be doubted <lb/>
            that he has become offensive and more powerful than is good <lb/>
            for us all ? Besides, men of Athens—Eubulus was present <lb/>
            and sitting in the theatre, when the people pronounced sen <lb/>
            tence on Midias; yet, though he was called upon by name, <lb/>
            and the defendant urgently entreated him, as you know, he <lb/>
            never stood up. If he thought the plaint preferred without a <lb/>
            cause, then was the time surely for a friend to speak in his <lb/>
            defence: if he refused then because he believed him guilty, <lb/>
            yet will ask you to acquit him now because he has himself <lb/>
            quarrelled with me, it is not for your honour to grant such a <lb/>
            request. I would have no person in a democracy so great, <lb/>
            that his support should cause one man to be insulted and <lb/>
            another to escape punishment. If you desire to strike a blow <lb/>

            are a statesman and a man of power; bring me to justice in <lb/>
            any way you please according to Jaw; but don't deprive me <lb/>
            of redress for the unlawful outrages which I have suffered. If <lb/>
            you are unable to reach me in this Way, it may be some proof <lb/>
            of my innocence, that, when you find it easy to accuse others, <lb/>
            you have no ground of accusation against me.</p>
          <p>I have heard that Philippides and Mnesarchides and Dio­ <lb/>
            timus of Euonymia and others like them, rich men and <lb/>
            trierarchs, will earnestly entreat you to pardon him, and ask <lb/>
            it as a favour to themselves. I would not say a word to you <lb/>
            in disparagement of those persons; I should be mad to do so: <lb/>
            but I will mention what, when they prefer this request, <lb/>
            ought to be passing in your minds. Consider, men of the <note type="footnote"> 1 Eubulus, to whom he points in the court. The quarrel, says Ulpian, <lb/>

            nor ever will it!)—but should they become masters of the <lb/>
            government with Midias and the like of him, and should any <lb/>
            one of you, you the commons and people's men, offend any <lb/>
            of these persons, (not as grossly as Midias has me, but in <lb/>
            some other way,) and be brought into a court composed of <lb/>
            them, what pity or mercy would he obtain, think ye ? They'd <lb/>
            be likely to show him favour, wouldn't they ?—or to listen <lb/>
            to a petition from one of the multitude, and not say at once,1 <lb/>

            many good things, which no one prevents their enjoying; <lb/>
            then don't let them deprive us of that security, which the <lb/>
            laws give us for a common property. It will be no injustice <lb/>
            or hardship to Midias, to possess as much as the bulk of you <lb/>
            whom he insults and calls beggars, and to be stripped of that <lb/>
            superfluity 1 which excites him to be insolent. And surely <lb/>
            these persons are not justified in asking such things of you— <lb/>
            " Do not decide according to the laws, men of the jury: do <lb/>
            not give redress to a party who has been deeply injured: <lb/>

            Such, if they ask anything for the defendant, will be the sub­ <lb/>

            0 Athenians, the people on hearing the facts had acquitted <lb/>
            Midias, it would not have been equally hard; for the charge <lb/>
            might have been untrue, or not have amounted to a contempt <lb/>
            of the festival; one might have consoled oneself with some <lb/>

            were so wrathful, so bitter, so exasperated, that, when Neop­ <lb/>
            tolemus and Mnesarchides and Philippides and some of these <lb/>
            immensely rich men were supplicating me and yourselves, <lb/>
            you shouted that he must not be let off; and when Blepæus <lb/>
            the banker came up to me, you made such an outcry, (just as <lb/>
            if I was going to take money,) that for fear of your clamour, <lb/>
            0 Athenians, I let go my mantle and was almost naked in my <lb/>
            tunic,1 trying to get away from him pulling me; and when <lb/>
            you met me afterwards-" Mind that you prosecute the <lb/>
            scoundrel, and don't make it up; the Athenians will have an <lb/>
            eye to what you do "-these were your expressions : and yet <lb/>
            after the thing has been voted to be an outrage, and they <lb/>

            a thing! Every kind of baseness would be involved in it. <lb/>
            And I deserve not to be so treated; how can I, 0 Athenians, <lb/>
            when I bring to trial a man who is notoriously an outrageous <lb/>
            bully, who has grossly misconducted himself at a festal meeting, <lb/>

            " the people's disbelief in the truth of the charges might have been," <lb/>
            &amp;c.; but the sentence is too brief to express that distinctly. Auger <lb/>
            renders it: " On pensera me serois-je dit, qu'il n'y a pas eu d'insulte <lb/>
            réelle, que la fète n'a pas été violée ; enfin j'aurois eu alors mille raisons <lb/>
            de me consoler." Pabst: weil man sick dann damit beruhigen könnte, <lb/>

            the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ίμάτιον</foreign>. The former was a tunic or shirt of woollen material, <lb/>
            without sleeves generally, and reaching not quite down to the knee. <lb/>
            The latter was a square cloak or mantle, which was thrown first over <lb/>
            the left shoulder, then brought round the back to the right shoulder, <lb/>
            and again folded over the left. It usually reached a little below the <lb/>
            knee. To wear it of greater length was considered-a mark of pride. <lb/>

            staying at Athens, witnesses of his insolence ? The people <lb/>
            heard what he had done: what then? they voted him guilty, <lb/>
            and delivered him over to you. It is impossible therefore <lb/>
            that your judgment should be concealed or remain a secret, <lb/>
            or that no inquiry should be made how you decided when <lb/>
            the case came before you. No; if you punish him, it will be <lb/>
            thought that you are wise and honourable men and haters of <lb/>
            iniquity; if you let him off, some unworthy motive, it will be <lb/>
            said, has prevailed over you. For he is not tried on a political <lb/>
            charge, or like Aristophon, who stopped the prosecution by <lb/>
            giving up the crowns,1 but because he has committed a per­ <lb/>
            sonal outrage and cannot possibly repair what he has done. <lb/>
            Under these circumstances, is it better to punish him now or <lb/>
            another time? I should think now; for the trial and the <lb/>
            offences for which he is tried concern the public.</p>
          <p>Besides, it was not me alone, men of Athens, that he meant <lb/>
            to beat or insult in doing what he did then, but all who may <lb/>
            be supposed less able than I am to obtain satisfaction for their <lb/>
            wrongs. If you did not all receive blows or affronts in the per­ <lb/>
            formance of choragic duties, you must be aware that you were <lb/>
            not all choir-masters together, and that no man single-handed <lb/>
            ever could bully you all at once. But when any injured party <lb/>
            fails to obtain satisfaction, each of you should expect that he <lb/>
            will be the next to suffer wrong; nor should you be indifferent <lb/>
            to such things, nor wait till they fall upon yourselves, but <lb/>
            take the earliest possible precaution against them. Midias <lb/>
            hates me perhaps, and some one else hates each of you. <lb/>
            Would you allow those who hate you to have the power of <lb/>
            doing, each to the object of his hatred, what Midias has done <lb/>
            to me? I should imagine not. Then don't leave me, 0 <lb/>
            Athenians, to the defendant's mercy. Only see. Presently, <lb/>
            when the court rises, every one of you sooner or later will <lb/>
            return home, not heeding nor caring nor troubling himself in <lb/>
            the least, whether a friend or an enemy will cross his path, <lb/>
            whether a big or a little man, a strong or a weak, or anything <lb/>
            of the kind. Wherefore so ? Because he is sure in his mind <note type="footnote"> 1 This man, says Ulpian, had kept in his hands certain tithes, out of <lb/>
            which some crowns had to be purchased for an offering to Pallas. <lb/>
            Having been prosecuted for this by Eubulus, before the day came for <lb/>

            of this, having a firm reliance upon the constitution, that no <lb/>
            one will lay hands upon him or assault or strike him. Thus <lb/>
            walking in security yourselves, will you leave me not equally <lb/>
            secured? And what can induce me to survive such treat­ <lb/>
            ment, if you refuse to assist me ? " Oh, never fear," it may <lb/>
            be said; "you'll not be insulted again." But suppose I am: <lb/>
            will you punish then, after acquitting now? Do not abandon <lb/>
            me or yourselves or the laws, 0 Athenians. If you will only <lb/>
            look and consider, by what it is that you the jurors of the <lb/>
            day are powerful and masters of everything in the state, <lb/>
            whether the state empanels two hundred jurors or a thousand <lb/>
            or any number whatsoever, you will find it is not by your <lb/>
            being the only citizens arrayed in arms, nor because the <lb/>
            iurors are the most able-bodied and robust men, nor by your <lb/>
            being the youngest in age or anything of that sort, but <lb/>
            because the laws are powerful. And what is the power of the <lb/>
            laws ? If any of you is injured and cries out, will they run <lb/>
            up and assist him ? No; they are but written words, and <lb/>
            cannot do this. In what then consists their strength ? In <lb/>
            your enforcing, in your makiag them effectual always for the <lb/>
            benefit of those who need them. Thus are the laws powerful <lb/>
            by you, and you by the laws: you should defend them there­ <lb/>
            fore just the same as you would defend yourselves against <lb/>
            injustice, and regard the wrongs of the laws, by whomsoever <lb/>
            they are found to be committed, as matters of public concern; <lb/>
            and there should be no services, no compassion, no influence, <lb/>
            no contrivance, nothing whatsoever by which a man who has <lb/>
            transgressed the laws can escape the penalty.</p>
          <p>You that were spectators at the Dionysia hissed and hooted <lb/>
            the defendant when he entered the theatre; so that you gave <lb/>
            tokens of abhorrence before you had heard a syllable about <lb/>
            him from me. Were you angry then before the thing was <lb/>
            proved ?—did you invite the aggrieved party to seek justice ? <lb/>
            -did you clap your hands when I arraigned him in the <lb/>

          <p>THE Council of Five Hundred was required every year to build some <lb/>
            new ships of war, and, if they failed to perform this duty, they were <lb/>
            forbidden by a special law to ask for the customary reward of a <lb/>
            crown, when they went out of office. It happened somewhere about <lb/>
            the year B. c. 356, that the treasurer of the shipbuilders ran away <lb/>
            with a sum of two talents and a half, and the Council, for want of <lb/>
            funds, was not able to provide a single galley for the public service. <lb/>
            Notwithstanding this, at the close of their official year Androtion <lb/>
            moved a decree in their favour, commending them for good conduct, <lb/>
            and awarding them a crown as usual. The decree was passed, but <lb/>
            he was indicted and brought to trial for it by two of his personal <lb/>
            enemies, Euctemon and Diodorus. Four charges were preferred <lb/>
            against him: first, that he had transgressed the above-mentioned <lb/>
            law; secondly, that his motion was not founded upon a previous <lb/>
            resolution of the Council; thirdly, that he had been guilty of in­ <lb/>
            famous practices, which disabled him to speak in public ; fourthly, <lb/>
            that he laboured under the like disability for having neglected to pay <lb/>
            a state-debt due from his father at his decease. Euctemon, as the <lb/>
            elder of the two prosecutors, opened the case to the jury : Diodorus <lb/>
            followed with this speech, composed for him by Demosthenes.</p>
          <p>The orator commences by declaring the motives which induced him to <lb/>
            prosecute. He had been deeply injured by Androtion : this, accord­ <lb/>
            ing to the opinions of his countrymen, fully justified him in coming <lb/>
            forward as a public accuser. He then proceeds to deal with those <lb/>
            parts of the case which had not been bandied so fully by Euctemon, <lb/>
            and especially to meet certain defences which he expected Androtion <lb/>
            would set up. It was clear, he contends, that a constitutional prin­ <lb/>
            ciple was violated in moving a decree without the previous sanction <lb/>
            of the Council, although there might have been some precedents for <lb/>
            such a course. It was equally clear, that, as the Council were for­ <lb/>
            bidden to ask for a crown after neglecting the duty of shipbuilding, <lb/>
            it was illegal for any other person to move that they should be <lb/>
            rewarded with a crown. The law which required ships to be pro­ <lb/>
            vided was one of the greatest importance; for the safety of the <lb/>
            commonwealth depended on her navy. It would be said, that the <lb/>
            treasurer who ran away with the fund, and not the Council, was to <lb/>
            blame; but it was dangerous to admit such excuses, and at any rate <lb/>
            the law was imperative, that, if there were no ships built, there <lb/>
            should be no crown. If it seemed hard, that five hundred council­ <lb/>
            lors should suffer for the negligence or misconduct of a few persons, <lb/>
             <pb n="139"/>
            ; it would be a good lesson to them not to be guided hereafter by bad <lb/>
            advisers. With respect to the personal charges against Androtion, <lb/>
            he would object, that they ought not to be brought forward now, <lb/>
            but should rather be made the subject of a distinct prosecution. The <lb/>
            law however allowed more than one method of punishing such <lb/>
            crimes ; and wisely so ; for it was dangerous to the constitution that <lb/>
            men of infamous lives should obtain a hearing of the people. He <lb/>
            would say perhaps, that he was persecuted because he made himself <lb/>
            unpopular as a collector of taxes. Any such observations would be <lb/>
            wholly irrelevant to the question before the court. The fact was how­ <lb/>
            ever, that he had got himself appointed a commissioner for collecting <lb/>
            arrears of property tax, and invested for that purpose with arbitrary <lb/>
            powers, which he had exercised with unnecessary harshness, entering <lb/>
            and searching men's houses, insulting them and throwing them into <lb/>
            prison. By such conduct he had rendered himself odious, and not <lb/>
            by the performance of his duty as collector; for the arrears which he <lb/>
            had enforced the payment of were very small. The whole thing was <lb/>
            a job of his own. Neither as a tax-collector nor in any other way <lb/>
            had he ever rendered or sought to render a service to the state. His <lb/>
            whole political career had been vicious and corrupt. The orator <lb/>
            refers to one special instance, in which Androtion had contrived to <lb/>
            rob the public by the melting down of some sacred crowns, and, after <lb/>
            dwelling for a while on the particulars of that case, concludes with <lb/>
            an appeal to the Athenians to choose worthier and better ministers <lb/>
            in future.</p>
          <p>It is said that Demosthenes laboured with great care in the composition <lb/>
            of this speech, knowing that he was opposed to an able and experi­ <lb/>
            enced orator, who had been a pupil of Isocrates. We find in it <lb/>
            much of the subtlety and elegance which we have remarked in the <lb/>
            Leptinea.</p>
          <p>As Euctemon having been wronged by Androtion, men of the <lb/>
            jury, determines at the same time to seek justice for the com­ <lb/>
            monwealth and satisfaction on his own account, I will endea­ <lb/>
            vour to do the same, if I possibly can. It so happens that, <lb/>
            while Euctemon has suffered cruel outrages in violation of <lb/>
            all the laws, they do not equal the troubles which Androtion <lb/>
            has caused me. The plot against my friend related to money <lb/>
            and an unjust expulsion from Athens : but I should have been <lb/>
            excluded from all society whatsoever, if the charges got up <lb/>
            against me by the defendant had found credence with you. <lb/>
            He accused me of what any one would have been afraid to <lb/>
            mention, who did not resemble him, namely, that I had <lb/>
            killed my own father; and having got up an indictment for <lb/>
            impiety, not against me but against my uncle, charging as <lb/>
            impiety that he had associated with me after an act of parri­ <lb/>
            cide, he put me upon a defence, in which if I had failed by <lb/>
             <pb n="140"/>
            any chance, I should have suffered the most cruel of injuries <lb/>
            by his contrivance. For what friend or what stranger would <lb/>
            have liked to meet me afterwards ? what city would have <lb/>
            allowed to be anywhere in its precincts a person supposed to <lb/>
            be guilty of such impiety ? None. I without difficulty <lb/>
            cleared myself of the charge on my trial before you: in fact, <lb/>
            the defendant did not obtain a fifth part of the votes. And <lb/>
            I will endeavour with your assistance, both now and at all <lb/>
            times hereafter, to avenge myself upon him.</p>
          <p>So much for personal matters, though indeed I could say <lb/>
            a good deal more. As to the questions upon which you are <lb/>
            now to give your verdict, and as to the defendant's public <lb/>
            acts by which he has done you no little damage, I will endea­ <lb/>
            vour to state briefly what it seemed to me that Euctemon <lb/>
            had omitted, and what it is better you should hear. If I saw <lb/>
            that Androtion had any honest defence upon the present <lb/>
            indictment, I would not have mentioned such matters: but <lb/>
            I am quite sure he can have nothing fair or straightforward <lb/>
            to urge, but will try to catch your verdict by artful argu­ <lb/>
            ments dressed up to meet the various charges. For he is <lb/>
            a well-trained speaker, 0 Athenians, and all his life has had <lb/>
            nothing else to do. Therefore, that he may not cajole you <lb/>
            -that he may not persuade you to vote contrary to your <lb/>
            oaths, and to acquit a man whom on many accounts you <lb/>
            ought to punish-attend to what I shall say. Having heard <lb/>
            me, you will be provided with a fit answer to every plea that <lb/>
            he can urge.</p>
          <p>He has one argument, which he thinks very clever, about <lb/>
            the omission of a resolution of Council. There is a law, he <lb/>
            says, that, if the Council appear to have performed their duties <lb/>
            worthily of reward, the people shall give them their reward. <lb/>
            The question, says he, was put by the chairman; the people <lb/>
            voted; it was carried in the affirmative. There is no need, <lb/>
            says he, for a previous resolution of Council here; for what <lb/>
            took place was according to law. I think quite differently, <lb/>
            and I imagine you will agree with me, that resolutions of <lb/>
            Council are only to be brought up in cases where the laws <lb/>
            permit; for upon a question that is not lawfully open surely <lb/>
            nothing at all ought to be proposed. He will say however, <lb/>
            that all the Councils which have ever had rewards from you <lb/>
            have received them in this manner, and that no previous <lb/>
             <pb n="141"/>
            resolution of Council has ever been passed for any. I believe <lb/>
            that what he asserts is untrue; indeed I am sure of it; but <lb/>
            were it ever so true, when the law orders differently, we ought <lb/>
            not surely, because an error has frequently been committed <lb/>
            before, to persist in it now, but on the contrary, we should <lb/>
            begin with you first and compel people to do as the law <lb/>
            directs. Don't you tell us then about the frequency of the <lb/>
            practice, but show that the practice is right. If the laws <lb/>
            have been violated formerly and you have followed the pre­ <lb/>
            cedent, you ought not to be acquitted on that account, but to <lb/>
            be condemned all the more. For as, if any of the former <lb/>
            parties had been convicted, you would not have moved this <lb/>
            decree, so, if you are punished now, no one will move it <lb/>
            again. 1 <note type="footnote"> 1 This argument is repeated in partly the same words in the Aristo­ <lb/>
            cratea, p. 653. It is cited with praise by Quintilian, v. 14, and Aulus <lb/>
            Gellius, x. 19. It touches a question which frequently arises, both in <lb/>
            courts of judicature and elsewhere, how far and in what manner it is <lb/>
            right to punish people for unlawful or vicious practices, which have <lb/>
            long been tolerated or connived at. It is urged on the one hand, " how <lb/>
            hard it would be, that a man should suffer for doing what hundreds <lb/>
            had done before him with impunity; " to which it is replied, " we must <lb/>
            begin with some one; it is necessary to make an example; else the <lb/>
            thing will go on for ever;" and the like. </note><note type="footnote"> Thus we find Cicero reasoning on the subject. In Verrem, Act II. <lb/>

          <p>As to the law which expressly forbids the Council to ask <lb/>
            for their reward without having built the ships, it is worth <lb/>
            while to hear the defence which he will set up, and, by what <lb/>
            he will venture to argue, to see what an impudent person he <lb/>
            is. " The law," says he, " forbids the Council to ask for their <lb/>
            reward, if they have built no galleys; I concede. But it <lb/>
            nowhere prevents the people. granting a reward he says. <lb/>
            " If I gave it at their request, I have moved contrary to the <lb/>

            of my decree, and assign some other reasons for awarding a <lb/>
            crown to the Council, how have I moved contrary to the <lb/>
            law ?" To this it is not difficult for you to make a proper <lb/>
            reply—first, that the committee of Council and the chairman <lb/>
            who puts these things to the vote asked the question, and <lb/>
            divided the assembly on it—" who thinks that the Couhcil <note type="footnote"> It is worth while also to compare the language of the Duke in <lb/>

            not ?"—but surely men who were not asking or demanding <lb/>
            anything should not have put the question at all. Besides, <lb/>
            there were charges preferred by Midias and some others against <lb/>
            the Council, upon which the members besought you not to <lb/>
            deprive them of their recompense. And this there is no <lb/>
            necessity for you jurors to be told by me; for you were in <lb/>
            the assembly yourselves and know that it occurred. When <lb/>
            therefore he denies that the Council asked for a crown, have <lb/>
            this answer for him. But I will show you also, that the law <lb/>
            forbids the people to grant one, if the Council have built no <lb/>
            ships. The statute, 0 Athenians, was expressed in this way, <lb/>
            making it unlawful for the Council without having built <lb/>
            galleys to ask for their reward, that it might be impossible for <lb/>
            the people even to be seduced or misled. For the legislator <lb/>
            thought it best not to let the thing depend upon the ability <lb/>
            of speakers, but that whatever he could devise that was just <lb/>
            and beneficial to the people should be ordained by law. <lb/>
            Have you not built the galleys ? Then don't ask for your <lb/>
            reward ? When it forbids to ask, does it not more strongly <lb/>
            prohibit the granting ?</p>
          <p>It is well also to inquire, 0 Athenians, how it comes that, <lb/>
            although the Council have performed all their other duties <lb/>
            creditably and no one has any complaint against them, still, <lb/>
            if they have not built galleys, it is unlawful to ask for their <lb/>
            reward. You will find that this stringent enactment is for <lb/>
            the people's good. For no one, I take it, will dispute, that <lb/>
            all which has ever happened to the republic, or which now <lb/>
            belongs to her, either of good fortune or the contrary, (that <lb/>
            I may avoid words of evil omen,) has proceeded in the one case <lb/>
            from the possession, in the other from the want, of a navy. <lb/>
            Many examples, ancient as well as modern, might be cited; <lb/>
            but let me first take what are familiar to all ears. Those <lb/>
            men who built the Propylæa and the Parthenon, and who <lb/>
            adorned our other temples with the spoil of the barbarians, <lb/>
            in which we all naturally pride ourselves-you have heard <lb/>
            of course, that, after they abandoned the city and were shut <lb/>
            up in Salamis, by having ships of war they gained a victory <lb/>
            at sea, and preserved the commonwealth and all that belonged <lb/>
            to them, and conferred signal benefits upon the rest of the <lb/>
            Greeks, of which time itself cannot cancel the memory. <lb/>
             <pb n="144"/>
            Well; that is a story of olden days. To come then to what <lb/>
            you have all witnessed-You know that lately you carried <lb/>
            succours to the Euboeans in three days, and sent away the <lb/>
            Thebans under an armistice. Would you have accomplished <lb/>
            this so speedily, if you had not had the new galleys which <lb/>
            conveyed your troops ? It would have been impossible. One <lb/>
            could mention many other successes which have attended us <lb/>
            through the good condition of the navy. Aye; and how <lb/>
            many disasters from its bad condition ? Most of them I will <lb/>
            pass by : but in the Decelean war, (I will remind you of one <lb/>
            old occurrence, which you are all better acquainted with than <lb/>
            I am,) although many dreadful misfortunes had happened to <lb/>
            our countrymen, they were not reduced to submission until <lb/>
            their navy was destroyed. And why speak of things so <lb/>
            ancient ? In the last war with the Lacedæmonians,1 when it <lb/>
            was thought you would not be able to send off a fleet, you <lb/>
            know in what a state the city was: you know that vetches <lb/>
            were for sale; but after you had sent it off, you obtained <lb/>
            peace on your own terms. When your ships therefore, 0 <lb/>
            Athenians, have such effect in turning the scale either way, <lb/>
            you have wisely made this an indispensable condition for the <lb/>
            Council's obtaining their reward. For should they discharge <lb/>
            all the rest of their duties creditably, and yet fail to construct <lb/>
            these, the instruments by which we originally acquired and <lb/>
            still preserve all that we have, I mean the galleys, the rest <lb/>
            would be of no use : for the safety of the state must first be <lb/>
            secured for the people. This man however is so fully per­ <lb/>
            suaded that he has the right to move and propose what he <lb/>
            pleases, that although the administration of the Council has <lb/>
            been in other respects what you hear, and they have ne­ <lb/>
            glected to build the galleys, he has framed a decree to give <lb/>
            ' them their reward.</p>
          <p>That this is not a contravention of the law, neither can the <lb/>
            defendant assert, nor you be made to believe. I hear how­ <lb/>
            ever, he will advance a plea of this kind, that the Council is <note type="footnote"> 1 The war in which Athens and Thebes were united against Sparta. <lb/>

            years before the peace, when the Athenians had not funds to equip <lb/>
            their fleet for the relief of Corcyra. See Xenophon, Hellen. vi. c. 2 ; <lb/>

            not to blame for the ships not having been built, but that the <lb/>
            treasurer of the shipbuilders ran away with four talents and <lb/>
            a half, and the thing has been a misfortune. In the first <lb/>
            place, I am astonished at this very thing, that he should ask <lb/>
            you to bestow a crown upon the Council for misfortune : for <lb/>
            I imagined that such honours were confined to successful <lb/>
            performances. And I have this further observation to make <lb/>
            to you—I say, it is not just to contend for both, that the <lb/>
            reward has not been given in contravention of law, and that <lb/>
            the omission to provide galleys is not the fault of the Council. <lb/>
            For if it is proper to reward the Council even without having <lb/>
            built any, what need to mention to whom the neglect is <lb/>
            attributable? If it is not lawful, why should the Council <lb/>
            be rewarded any the more, because he can show that it was <lb/>
            owing to this or that person that ships were never built? <lb/>
            Besides, it appears to me that such arguments give you an <lb/>
            option, whether you think proper to hear pleas and excuses <lb/>
            from men who injure you, or to possess ships. For, should <lb/>
            you accept this plea of the defendant, it would be manifest <lb/>
            to all Councils, that their business is to find out plausible <lb/>
            excuses to offer you, not to construct galleys: and the con­ <lb/>
            sequence will be, that your money will be spent and you will <lb/>
            have no ships. But if, as the law commands and as becomes <lb/>
            men upon their oaths, you proceed sternly and strictly to <lb/>
            overrule excuses, and let it be seen that you have with­ <lb/>
            held the reward because the ships have not been built, <lb/>
            they will all have your galleys forthcoming, 0 Athenians, <lb/>
            having observed that nothing has so much influence with <lb/>
            you as the law. That no other party however is to blame <lb/>
            for the omission of the shipbuilding, I will show you clearly: <lb/>
            for the Council, by infringing this law, voted themselves <lb/>
            guilty. 1 <note type="footnote"> 1 '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Εχειροτόνησεν αύτήν</foreign>. sc. <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἰτίαν</foreign>. The Council, instead of procuring <lb/>
            Androtion to move an unlawful decree in their favour, should rather <lb/>
            have declined the honour of a crown under the circumstances; for, <lb/>
            though they were not implicated in the fraud of the treasurer, still the <lb/>
            public loss was a misfortune for which they were in some measure re­ <lb/>
            sponsible. The anxiety which they showed to clear their character <lb/>
            betrayed a consciousness that they were in fault. </note><note type="footnote"> Such is the best explanation which I can devise; but I am rather <lb/>

          <p>Again, as to the law concerning impudicity, he pretends to <lb/>
            say that we insult and slander him unfairly: and he says <lb/>
            that, if we had any confidence in the truth of our charges, <lb/>
            we ought to have appeared against him before the Judges, so <lb/>
            as to risk a thousand drachms in case we were thought to be <lb/>
            false accusers; but that now we are imposing on the Court <lb/>
            by idle accusation and abuse, and troubling you with matters <lb/>
            over which you have no jurisdiction. I would have you <lb/>
            reflect above all things, that accusation and abuse are very <lb/>
            different from proof. It is accusation simply, when a man <lb/>
            makes a bare statement without furnishing any grounds for <lb/>
            believing him: it is proof, when a man at the same time <lb/>
            demonstrates the truth of what he says. Those who prove <lb/>
            a case must either give circumstantial evidence to make you <lb/>
            believe it, or offer reasonable arguments, or produce witnesses: <lb/>
            for of some things it is impossible to give you ocular demon­ <lb/>
            stration ; but whenever one can bring any of these tests, you <lb/>
            rightly consider that you have sufficient proof of the truth. <lb/>
            We make out our charges not by probable arguments, not <note type="footnote"> Schaefer's interpretation, which however scarcely satisfies him, renders <lb/>

            by circumstantial evidence, but by a witness from whom the <lb/>
            defendant can most readily obtain satisfaction, a man pro­ <lb/>
            ducing a paper in which the acts of this man's life are stated, <lb/>
            and who has made himself responsible for his testimony. <lb/>
            When therefore he says that these charges are mere accusa­ <lb/>
            tion and abuse, reply to him, that it is proof, and that his <lb/>
            own proceeding is accusation and abuse merely. When he <lb/>
            says that we ought to have denounced him before the Judges, <lb/>
            reply to him, that we mean to do that, but that we are now <lb/>
            also properly referring to the law. If, Androtion, we were <lb/>
            advancing this charge against you upon any other kind of <lb/>
            trial, you might justly have complained: but when you are <lb/>
            upon your trial for proposing an illegal measure, and the laws <lb/>
            do not allow persons who have lived such lives to move even <lb/>
            what is legal, and we show that you have not only moved an <lb/>
            unlawful decree but led an unlawful life, how can it be im­ <lb/>
            proper to refer to a law by means of which your criminality <lb/>
            is proved ?</p>
          <p>And you should be informed moreover, that Solon, who <lb/>
            enacted these laws and most of the rest, a lawgiver of a <lb/>
            different kind from the defendant, gave to all who require <lb/>
            satisfaction for injuries not one way only, but many ways of <lb/>
            proceeding against the wrong-doers. He knew, I take it, <lb/>
            that for all persons in the state to be equal, all clever or <lb/>
            bold or well-behaved, would be impossible. If he should so <lb/>
            frame his laws that only the well-behaved could obtain <lb/>
            justice, he perceived that many rogues would remain un­ <lb/>
            punished; if so as to help the bold and eloquent only, he <lb/>
            saw that ordinary men would not be able to get justice like <lb/>
            them : and his opinion was that no man should be debarred <lb/>
            from obtaining justice in the way that best suited his <lb/>
            capacity. How then was that to be? By allowing many <lb/>
            methods of proceeding at Jaw against delinquents: as for <lb/>
            theft. 1-Are you able-bodied and confident in yourself? Take <note type="footnote"> 1 We learn from this passage, as well as from other sources, that at <lb/>
            Athens the owner of stolen goods had the option of proceeding against <lb/>
            the thief either civilly or criminally, contrary to the practice of our <lb/>
            law, by which the civil injury is merged in the felony, and the owner <lb/>
            can only recover his goods by prosecuting the thief to conviction. The <lb/>
            principle of the English law is plain enough. Theft is a crime against <lb/>
            society, and the good of society requires that it should be dealt with as </note> <note type="footnote"> L2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="148"/>
            the thief to prison: but you risk the penalty of a thousand <lb/>
            drachms. Are you not so strong ? Take the Archons with <lb/>
            you; they will do it. Are you afraid of this too ? Indict <lb/>
            him. Do you distrust yourself, and are you too poor to pay <lb/>
            a thousand drachms ? Sue him for larceny before the Arbi­ <lb/>
            trator, and you will run no risk. None of these courses is <lb/>
            the same. For impiety in like manner you may take to <lb/>
            prison, indict, sue before the Eumolpids, lay an information <lb/>
            before the King. 1 And in all other cases pretty nearly in the <lb/>
            same way. Now if any one, instead of contending that he <lb/>
            was not a malefactor, or not guilty of impiety, or whatever <lb/>
            else he was tried for, should seek to obtain his acquittal on <lb/>
            such grounds as these-in case he were taken up, that you <lb/>
            might have sued him before an arbitrator or ought to have <note type="footnote"> such : the private advantage of the individual is postponed to the ne­ <lb/>
            cessities of public justice; and therefore it is not lawful even to com­ <lb/>
            promise the affair with the thief. This principle however is not extended <lb/>
            to misdemeanours of the same character with theft, such as embezzle­ <lb/>
            ment, and obtaining goods under false pretences, where the injured <lb/>
            party may generally waive the criminal part of the offence, and recover <lb/>
            his debt or damages in an action. </note><note type="footnote"> Under the Athenian law the party robbed might bring his action <lb/>
            either before an arbitrator or before a jury, and recover the stolen <lb/>
            article, together with damages twice its value, or damages ten times its <lb/>
            value if the article itself could not be restored. The jury might at the <lb/>
            same time order the thief to be put in the stocks for five days; and <lb/>
            their verdict against him was attended with disfranchisement. Any Athe­ <lb/>
            nian might proceed to indict him, if the injured party declined to do so. <lb/>
            Stealing anything in the night-time, or from the gymnasia, or stealing in <lb/>
            the daytime to a greater amount than fifty drachms, or from the baths <lb/>
            or the harbour to a greater amount than ten drachms, was punishable <lb/>
            with death. When the thief was caught in the act of stealing, the <lb/>
            owner of the goods might carry him off at once to the Eleven, and <lb/>
            have him sent to prison; or, if he was afraid to do it himself, he might <lb/>
            bring the magistrates to the spot, and get them to do it for him, as <lb/>
            mentioned in the text. </note><note type="footnote"> See Appendix IX.; and Meier and Schömann, Att. Proc. pp. 229, <lb/>
            356. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 As to the jurisdiction of the King-Archon in cases of impiety, see <lb/>
            Appendix IV. The Eumolpidæ were an ancient priestly family, from <lb/>
            whom was chosen the Hierophant of the Eleusinian Mysteries. (See <lb/>
            Appendix VI.) They were the interpreters of a traditionary ceremonial <lb/>
            law, in relation to which they were invested with some sort of judicial <lb/>
            power. Whether it was subordinate to that of the King, or independent, <lb/>
            or in what manner it was exercised, is not known. See Meier and <lb/>

            indicted him ; in case he were defending an action before an <lb/>
            arbitrator, that you should have taken him up, so that you <lb/>
            might have risked a thousand drachms-it would be ridicu­ <lb/>
            lous surely. For a man who is innocent ought not to make <lb/>
            any objection to the mode of punishment, but to show that <lb/>
            he is innocent. In like manner, Androtion, if you move <lb/>
            decrees after having committed infamous crime, don't imagine <lb/>
            that you are to escape punishment because it is competent <lb/>
            for us also to denounce you before the Judges: but either <lb/>
            show that you are not guilty, or submit to the penalty of <lb/>
            having moved when your character was such; for you have <lb/>
            no right to do so. If we forbear to prosecute you in all the <lb/>
            ways which the laws allow, be thankful to us for those which <lb/>
            we omit; don't on that account seek to escape punishment <lb/>
            altogether.</p>
          <p>It is worth your while, 0 Athenians, to look into the cha­ <lb/>
            racter of Solon who passed the law, and to see what fore­ <lb/>
            thought he took for the constitution in all the laws that he <lb/>
            framed, and how much more anxious he was about that than <lb/>
            about the immediate subject of any law that he was passing. <lb/>
            One may see this in many ways, but especially from this law <lb/>
            which forbids persons guilty of impudicity either to speak or <lb/>
            propose decrees. For he saw that, although the great body <lb/>
            of the people are at liberty to speak, they do not speak : he <lb/>
            considered therefore that this was no hardship ; and, had his <lb/>
            object been to punish these men, he might have enacted <lb/>
            many severer penalties. But he was not anxious about that: <lb/>
            he imposed the disabilities I speak of on behalf of you and <lb/>
            the constitution. For he knew, he knew, that to men of <lb/>
            infamous lives that government is the most unfavourable, in <lb/>
            which all people are at liberty to publish their shame. What <lb/>
            is this? A democracy. He thought then it would be dan­ <lb/>
            gerous, if there should ever happen to be at the same time <lb/>
            a large number of men, who were bold and clever speakers, <lb/>
            but infected with these infamous crimes: for the people <lb/>
            might under their influence commit many errors, and they <lb/>
            might either attempt to overthrow the popular government <lb/>
            entirely, (for in oligarchies, though men have led still more <lb/>
            disgraceful lives than Androtion, it is not allowable to speak <lb/>
            ill of the rulers,) or they might corrupt the people as much <lb/>
            as they could, to make them as like as possible to themselves. <lb/>
             <pb n="150"/>
            Therefore he forbade persons of this description to take any <lb/>
            part in the public counsels, for fear the people should be <lb/>
            betrayed into error. Notwithstanding which, this honourable <lb/>
            man not only thought proper to make speeches and motions <lb/>
            when he was under disability, but even to make illegal ones.</p>
          <p>With respect to the law by which, as his father owed money <lb/>
            to the state and had never paid it, he is not permitted to <lb/>
            speak or to frame decrees, this will be the proper answer <lb/>
            for you to make, if he says that we ought to lay an informa­ <lb/>
            tion against him. We shall do so hereafter-decidedly not <lb/>
            now, Androtion, when you are to render an account of other <lb/>
            crimes which you have committed-but at the fitting time <lb/>
            according to the law. Now however we show, that the law <lb/>
            does not permit you to make even such motions as are allow­ <lb/>
            able to other citizens. Prove therefore that your father was <lb/>
            not indebted, or that he got out of prison not by running <lb/>
            away, but by satisfying the debt. If you are unable to prove <lb/>
            this, you have moved a decree when you had no right to do <lb/>
            so; for the law makes you the inheritor of your father's dis­ <lb/>
            franchisement, and being disfranchised you had no business <lb/>
            to speak or to move.</p>
          <p>As to the laws then which we have cited against him, 1 if <lb/>
            he should strive to deceive and lead you astray, you must <lb/>
            answer him in the manner that I have explained.</p>
          <p>He has arguments also upon other points, which are, <lb/>
            admirably contrived for your deception ; and. it is better that <lb/>
            you should be informed of them beforehand. He has one to, <lb/>
            this effect, that you should not deprive of their reward or <lb/>
            involve in disgrace five hundred Athenian citizens : " they <lb/>
            are upon their trial," he says, " not I." Now, if you were <lb/>
            about to deprive them only, and to confer no benefit upon <lb/>
            the commonwealth, I would not have had you trouble your­ <lb/>
            selves much about it: but if by doing so you will encourage <lb/>
            more than ten thousand other citizens to become better men, <lb/>
            how much more to your credit is it to make so many persons <lb/>
            honest, than to oblige five hundred unjustly. That the <lb/>
            affair however does not concern the whole Council, but only <note type="footnote"> 1 The laws which Androtion violated by his decree, which we have­ <lb/>
            copied out and exhibited in court in juxtaposition with his decree. <lb/>
            (See Volume II. p. 46, note 1.) </note><note type="footnote"> . Pabst renders it here: die Gesetze welche wir angeführt haben. </note> <lb/>

            some members (who have caused the mischief) and Androtion, <lb/>
            I am able to show you. To whom can it be a disgrace, when <lb/>
            he is silent and frames no resolution, and perhaps rarely <lb/>
            comes into the Council-chamber, that the Council don't <lb/>
            get their crown ? To no man surely. The shame is his, that <lb/>
            frames resolutions and takes a part in public business and <lb/>
            persuades the Council to do what he pleases : for it is through <lb/>
            such men that the Council have not deserved a crown for <lb/>
            their administration. Granting however most fully that the <lb/>
            whole Council are now upon their trial, see how much more <lb/>
            it is for your interest to convict them than not to convict. <lb/>
            If you acquit them, the Council-chamber will be ruled by <lb/>
            the speakers; if you convict them, it will be ruled by the <lb/>
            ordinary members : for the majority, having seen this Council <lb/>
            deprived of their crown through the bad conduct of the <lb/>
            speakers, will not leave the business in their hands, but <lb/>
            advise themselves what is for the best. And if this should <lb/>
            take place, and you should be quit of the old set of orators, <lb/>
            you will see all things going on as they should do, 0 Athe­ <lb/>
            nians. On this account then, if for nothing else, you should <lb/>
            pass sentence of conviction.</p>
          <p>Let me tell you another thing which ought not to escape <lb/>
            you. Perhaps Philip and Antigenes will get up and plead <lb/>
            for the Council; and also the checking-clerk 1 and some <lb/>
            others, who with the defendant used to manage that chamber, <lb/>
            and who are the authors of these malpractices. Now I <lb/>
            should inform you, that these men, though the pretext of <lb/>
            their advocacy is to defend the Council, will in reality fight <lb/>
            their own battle, to help out the account which they must <lb/>
            render of their conduct. For thus the matter stands. If you <lb/>
            acquit the defendant on this indictment, they are all released, <lb/>
            and none can ever be brought to justice: for who could find <lb/>
            a verdict against them after your crowning the Council of <lb/>
            whom they had the guidance ? If you convict him, in the first <lb/>
            place you will have pronounced a verdict in accordance with <lb/>
            -your oaths; in the next place, when you get these men at <lb/>
            their audits, whomsoever you believe to be guilty, you will <note type="footnote"> 1 This officer kept a record of the monies paid to the Council, and in <lb/>
            every Prytany he laid the accounts of the revenue before the popular <lb/>
            Assembly. He therefore had to pass his audit when he went out of <lb/>
            office. (See Vol. II. Appendix IV. p. 338.) </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="152"/>
            punish ; whom not guilty, you will then discharge. Do not <lb/>
            therefore give ear to them as if they were speaking on behalf <lb/>
            of the Council and the people, but regard them with indigna­ <lb/>
            tion as persons deceitfully pleading their own cause.</p>
          <p>I believe also that Archias of Cholargus, who was a coun­ <lb/>
            cillor last year, will, on the strength of his good character, <lb/>
            petition and plead for them. You ought, I think, when you <lb/>
            hear Archias, to do something of this sort-ask him whether <lb/>
            he thinks what the Council are charged with is creditable or <lb/>
            discreditable : if he says creditable, you must listen to him <lb/>
            no more as a well-principled man.; if discreditable, ask him, <lb/>
            why he allowed such conduct, when he pretends to be a man of <lb/>
            good principle. And if he says that he opposed it, but that <lb/>
            no one hearkened to him, surely it is strange that he should <lb/>
            now defend a Council which would not hearken to his good <lb/>
            advice : if he admits that he was silent, is it not a crime, that <lb/>
            he should have neglected his opportunity of dissuading people <lb/>
            from evil designs, and should now venture to say that men <lb/>
            who have done such mischief deserve a crown ?</p>
          <p>Nor will he forbear to urge, I expect, that all this has <lb/>
            happened to him on account of the taxes which he collected <lb/>
            on your behalf (so he will tell you) from a few persons who <lb/>
            were not ashamed to be largely in arrear. 1 And he will <lb/>
            accuse (it will be easy enough) those men who did not pay <note type="footnote"> 1 Böckh, in his Public Economy of Athens (Transl. vol. ii. p. 304), <lb/>
            cites this passage to prove that other citizens besides the select twelve <lb/>
            hundred were assessed to the property-tax : </note><note type="footnote"> " It is probable that many others besides the twelve hundred paid <lb/>
            taxes, who, although their property was less considerable, were assessed <lb/>
            in the total valuation;. and this supposition receives considerable sup­ <lb/>
            port from a fact mentioned in an oration of Demosthenes. Androtion <lb/>
            was employed to collect some outstanding taxes which belonged to <lb/>
            the impost laid on in the archonship of Nausinicus, and he collected <lb/>
            seven out of fourteen talents; they were however small sums, not one <lb/>
            amounting to a mina, as Demosthenes says, but a little more than <lb/>
            seventy drachms from one person, and from another thirty-four. That <lb/>
            these were the arrears of payments which had been made by instal­ <lb/>
            ments, is very improbable : we are nowhere informed that the payments <lb/>
            were ever made in this manner; nor is it indeed credible, since the <lb/>
            necessities of the state required prompt payment. We should not <lb/>
            therefore be justified in assuming that such a liberty was granted by <lb/>
            the state; and even if it did exist, what rich man would have remained <lb/>
            thirty-four drachms in debt? It follows therefore that these were­ <lb/>
            taxes due from persons of small fortune, who from their inability to </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="153"/>
            their property-tax, and will say that, if you convict him, all <lb/>
            people may refuse to pay taxes with impunity. Now do <lb/>
            reflect, men of Athens : in the first place, you are not sworn <lb/>
            to decide upon these matters, but whether he moved his <lb/>
            decree according to the laws: in the next place, it is mon­ <lb/>
            strous in one who complains of others wronging the state, to <lb/>
            ask that he should not be punished for his own more grievous <lb/>
            wrong-doings; for surely it is a far more grievous offence to <lb/>
            frame illegal decrees than not to pay your property-tax. But <lb/>
            were it clear that upon this man's conviction no one would <lb/>
            pay taxes or be willing to collect them, even then you ought <lb/>
            not to acquit him, as I will make you see. Upon all the <lb/>
            taxes from the time of Nausinicus, perhaps on three hundred <lb/>
            talents or a little more, there is a deficiency of fourteen <lb/>
            talents, of which the defendant levied seven; I will assume <lb/>
            however that he levied the whole. Well: you don't need <lb/>
            Androtion for those that pay willingly, but for the defaulters. <lb/>
            You have therefore to consider, whether this is the value at <lb/>
            which you estimate the constitution and the established laws <lb/>
            and the observance of your oaths: for should you let the <lb/>
            defendant off, when he has so clearly made an illegal motion, <lb/>
            it will be universally thought that you have preferred this <lb/>
            money to the laws and to the observance of your oaths : and <lb/>
            yet, if any one offered you such a sum out of his own pocket, <lb/>
            it were not worth your acceptance, much less on the terms <lb/>
            that you should levy it from others. When therefore he <lb/>
            urges this, remember your oaths and consider, that upon this <lb/>
            indictment the question is not about the collection of taxes, <lb/>
            but whether your laws are to be in force.</p>
          <p>I have thus shown, in what manner he will attempt to <lb/>
            mislead you by diverting your attention from the law, and <lb/>
            what you have to keep in mind to prevent his so doing. I <note type="footnote"> pay them, were obliged to submit to be insultingly treated by An­ <lb/>
            drotion, and to be unjustly thrown into prison; and since Androtion <lb/>
            collected seven talents, and as no one paid a whole mina, he must have <lb/>
            collected taxes from at least four or five hundred persons. Now if we <lb/>
            reckon that the other seven talents were in like manner chiefly made <lb/>
            up of small sums, which is the only probable assumption, it gives about <lb/>
            twelve hundred people whose taxes were in arrear; these however <lb/>
            cannot have been the twelve hundred wealthy persons, but citizens <lb/>
            of a lower valuation, who paid even such small sums as these with <lb/>
            difficulty." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="154"/>
            could say much more upon the subject, but as I think I have <lb/>
            said enough already, I shall let it pass.</p>
          <p>I wish also to examine the political conduct of this worthy <lb/>
            fellow, in which it will appear he has stopped short of nothing <lb/>
            that is atrocious: for I will show him to be impudent, <lb/>
            audacious, thievish, overbearing, anything but fit to be <lb/>
            a statesman in a democracy. And first1 let us inquire into <lb/>
            that upon which he most plumes himself, his collection of <lb/>
            the debts : without heeding this man's boasts, let us look at <lb/>
            the thing as it has really occurred. He said that Eucte­ <lb/>
            mon retained your taxes, and undertaking to prove his <lb/>
            charge or himself to pay down the money, under this pre­ <lb/>
            tence he got you to depose a functionary elected by lot,2 <lb/>
            and so crept into the collection. He harangued you on the <lb/>
            occasion, saying, that you had the choice of three things, <lb/>
            either to break up your sacred vessels, or to have a new <lb/>
            contribution, or to demand payment of those in arrear; and, <lb/>
            as you naturally chose to demand payment of those in arrear, <lb/>
            and as he had won you by his promises and had a license <lb/>
            under the circumstances of the time, he did not think pro­ <lb/>
            per either to act under the existing laws, or, if he thought <lb/>
            them insufficient, to pass new ones, but moved illegal and <lb/>
            shameful decrees in the assembly, by means of which he <lb/>
            made a job for himself and has largely plundered you, putting <lb/>
            in a clause that the Eleven a should accompany him. At­ <lb/>
            tended by them, he led the way to the houses of his fellow- <note type="footnote"> 1 This passage is repeated with some variations in the speech against <lb/>
            Timocrates, p. 750—752. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Euctemon was probably one of the regular officers engaged in the <lb/>
            management or collection of the property-tax (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιγραφει̑ς</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκλογει̑ς</foreign>), <lb/>
            who were appointed, like many other functionaries, by lot. See Böckh's <lb/>
            Public Economy of Athens, Transl. ii. 211. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 The Eleven were an executive and also judicial board, elected <lb/>
            annually by lot, one from each tribe. To the ten thus chosen was <lb/>
            attached a Secretary, who held an equally responsible situation, and <lb/>
            therefore the whole body were called the Eleven. In their executive- <lb/>
            capacity they were like our sheriffs, having charge of the prison and <lb/>
            its inmates, and being entrusted to carry into execution the last sen­ <lb/>
            tence of the law. The gaolers and executioners acted as their servants. <lb/>
            When torture was inflicted in either civil or criminal cases, it was <lb/>
            under their superintendence. They had a summary jurisdiction over <lb/>
            certain heinous crimes, such as theft, housebreaking, kidnapping; and <lb/>
            upon the confession of the accused, could of their own authority inflict <lb/>
            capital punishment. Those who did not confess, they put in prison </note> <lb/>

            citizens. And Euctemon, from whom he said he would get the <lb/>
            taxes or himself make them good, he could prove nothing <lb/>
            against, but proceeded to get them in from you, as if he <lb/>
            had entered upon the task because he was your enemy and <lb/>
            not Euctemon's. Don't understand me to say, that payment <lb/>
            ought not to be required of the defaulters. It ought: but <lb/>
            how ? As the law commands, for the good of the rest: that <lb/>
            is in accordance with the principles of democracy. You have <lb/>
            not been so much benefited, 0 Athenians, by all these sums <lb/>
            being levied in such a way, as you have been damnified by <lb/>
            the introduction of such practices into the constitution. <lb/>
            If you will only inquire, why men would rather live under <lb/>
            a democracy than under an oligarchy, you will find the most <lb/>
            obvious reason to be this, that everything is milder in a <lb/>
            democracy. I need not say that the defendant has been more <lb/>
            outrageous than any oligarchy you like to mention. But let me <lb/>
            ask-When have the most atrocious things been done in our <lb/>
            commonwealth ? You will all say, in the time of the Thirty. <lb/>
            Yet then, we are told, no man was deprived of safety, who <lb/>
            could conceal himself at home; but we accuse the Thirty, <lb/>
            because, they unjustly carried men to prison from the market- <lb/>
            place. Androtion however surpassed them in brutality; for <lb/>
            he, acting as statesman under a popular government, made <lb/>
            every man's private house a prison, conducting to your houses <lb/>
            the Eleven. What think ye of this, 0 Athenians—that a <lb/>
            poor man, or even a rich one who had been at great expense <lb/>
            and perhaps for some reason or other was out of cash, should <lb/>
            get over the roof to his neighbours house or hide himself under <lb/>
            a bed, that he might not be caught and dragged to prison, <lb/>
            or commit other improprieties, befitting slaves rather than <lb/>
            freemen, and be seen so doing by his wife, whom he espoused <lb/>
            as a freeman and a citizen of the republic ? And what think <lb/>
            ye of Androtion being the cause of this, a man who on account <lb/>
            of his life and conduct is forbidden to seek justice on his own <lb/>
            behalf, much more on behalf of the state ? I am sure, if he <lb/>
            were asked whether the property or the person is answerable <lb/>
            for taxes, he would say the property, if he meant to speak <lb/>
            truly; for it is from property that we contribute. Why then, <note type="footnote"> and brought to trial. They had also a judicial authority upon questions <lb/>
            concerning confiscated property. (Meier and Schömann, Att. Proc. 71, <lb/>
            &amp;c.; Schömann, Ant. Jur. Publ. 245.) </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="156"/>
            instead of sequestering lands and houses and scheduling them, <lb/>
            why, Androtion, did you imprison and insult members of <lb/>
            the commonwealth and the poor resident aliens, whom you. <lb/>
            have treated with more insolence than your own servants ? <lb/>
            If you will only consider what is the difference between being <lb/>
            a slave and a freeman, you will find this to be the chief dis­ <lb/>
            tinction, that with slaves the person is responsible for all <lb/>
            offences, while freemen, though they commit the most serious <lb/>
            offences, can escape personal chastisement; for in most cases <lb/>
            we have to get satisfaction from them in money. Androtion <lb/>
            however inflicted corporal punishment on people, as if they <lb/>
            were bondsmen. And on such base and selfish principles did <lb/>
            he act towards you, that, while he allowed his father who was <lb/>
            in prison for a public debt to escape without payment or <lb/>
            trial, he thought that any other citizen who could not pay <lb/>
            taxes out of his own property should be dragged from his <lb/>
            house to gaol. Further, as if he was at liberty to do any­ <lb/>
            thing he liked, he distrained upon Sinope and Phanostrate, <lb/>
            women of the town certainly, but not owing any property- <lb/>
            tax. If it be thought that they were fit persons to be harshly <lb/>
            treated, this at all events is not a fit thing to happen, that <lb/>
            any one should be so exalted by circumstances, as to go to <lb/>
            the houses of persons who owe nothing, and carry away their <lb/>
            furniture. One could find many who deserve to be and to <lb/>
            have been harshly treated: but the laws and the customs <lb/>
            of the constitution, which you have to observe, speak a <lb/>
            different language. In them is mercy, indulgence, every­ <lb/>
            thing which freemen are entitled to : but of such qualities <lb/>
            Androtion, as you might expect, is by nature and education <lb/>
            entirely destitute; for he has submitted to constant insults <lb/>
            and affronts in his connexion with men, who never loved but <lb/>
            were able to hire him; for which he ought to vent his anger <lb/>
            not upon the first citizen that meets him, nor upon prosti­ <lb/>
            tutes of the same trade as himself, but on his father who <lb/>
            brought him up in such a manner.</p>
          <p>That such proceedings were not shameful and in violation <lb/>
            of all the laws, he will not be able to contend : he is so impu­ <lb/>
            dent however, that in the assembly, striving always to anti­ <lb/>
            cipate his defence to this indictment, he ventured to say, that <lb/>
            he had drawn enemies upon himself and was then in extreme <lb/>
            peril on your account and through you. I will show you, <lb/>
             <pb n="157"/>
            men of Athens, that he has neither suffered nor is likely to <lb/>
            suffer any evil through what he did on your account: but <lb/>
            that through his. own odious and execrable conduct, though <lb/>
            up to the present day he has suffered nothing, he will be <lb/>
            a sufferer, if you perform your duty. Just consider. What <lb/>
            was it that he promised you, and what did you appoint him <lb/>
            to do ? To collect money. And to do what else ? Nothing. <lb/>
            Come then, let me recal to your mind the particulars of <lb/>
            this collecting. He levied from Leptines of Cœle thirty-four <lb/>
            drachms, from Theoxenus of Alopece seventy drachms and <lb/>
            a little more : and from Callicrates the son of Euphemus and <lb/>
            the young son of Telestus1 -I don't remember his name­ <lb/>
            however, of all that he levied upon, not to enumerate them <lb/>
            individually, I hardly know if there was one that owed above <lb/>
            a mina. Do you imagine that these various persons are at <lb/>
            enmity and war with him on account of his tax-collecting, or <lb/>
            rather for different reasons-one, because he said in the <lb/>
            hearing of you all in the assembly, that he was a slave and <lb/>
            the descendant of slaves, and ought to be rated upon the <lb/>
            sixth part of his property with the aliens; another2 he <lb/>
            declared had children by a common woman; this man's <lb/>
            father had been debauched, that one's mother was a pros­ <lb/>
            titute ; one man's thefts he was scheduling from the begin­ <lb/>
            ning ; 3 another he said this and that about; another he <lb/>
            abused by wholesale; and so on with all ? I am sure that <lb/>
            the persons towards whom he so intemperately conducted <lb/>
            himself, every one of them considered the tax to be a neces­ <lb/>
            sary expense; but they have been deeply offended at these <lb/>
            indignities and insults. I am certain also, that you appointed <note type="footnote"> 1 Auger renders this: " autant sur Callicrate fils d'Euphème at sur <lb/>

            this man to collect money, not to bring up every man's private <lb/>
            misfortunes to reproach him with. If they really occurred, <lb/>
            Androtion, you ought not to have spoken of them ; for many <lb/>
            things happen to all of us that we don't like : if they were <lb/>
            purely your own invention, what do not you deserve ?</p>
          <p>Here is a yet more certain proof, that they all hate him, <lb/>
            not for his collecting, but for the saucy insolence with which <lb/>
            they have been treated. Satyrus, the superintendent of the <lb/>
            arsenal, levied for you not seven but thirty-four talents from <lb/>
            these same persons, out of which he furnished the ships that <lb/>
            sailed out. He does not pretend that he has got enemies on <lb/>
            that account: none of the parties from whom he levied is at <lb/>
            war with him. Just as one would expect. He, I take it, <lb/>
            did what was required of him: you in your petulance and <lb/>
            presumption, being invested with some authority, thought <lb/>
            proper to heap false and foul reproaches upon men who had <lb/>
            expended large sums upon the commonwealth, and who were <lb/>
            of better character and better family than yourself. Then <lb/>
            must the jury believe that you did all this for their sakes, <lb/>
            and take upon themselves the acts of your wickedness and <lb/>
            brutality ? They ought to detest you rather than support <lb/>
            you for such conduct. For a man who acts as representative <lb/>
            of the state should imitate the character of the state, and you, <lb/>
            men of Athens, ought to support such persons, and detest all <lb/>
            who are like the defendant. I must tell you this, though you <lb/>
            know it-Whatever kind of persons you are seen to cherish <lb/>
            and protect, you will be thought to resemble them.</p>
          <p>That he1 has not made these levies at all for your sake, <lb/>
            I will quickly show you. If he were asked, who he thinks <lb/>
            do the greater injury to the state, those who farm and live <lb/>
            frugally, but through their having to maintain children, <lb/>
            through domestic expenses and other public burdens, are in <lb/>
            arrear with the property-tax, or those who plunder your <lb/>
            allies and destroy the means of people willing to pay the tax, <lb/>
            surely with all his impudence he would not be bold enough <lb/>
            to say, that men who do not contribute their own money <lb/>
            commit greater crime than men who steal that of the public. <lb/>
            How comes it then, you abominable fellow, when it is more <lb/>
            than thirty years since you commenced your political career, <lb/>
            and in that period many generals have wronged the republic, <note type="footnote"> 1 Repeated in the Oration against Timocrates, p. 753. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="159"/>
            and many orators too, who have been tried before your coun­ <lb/>
            trymen, some of whom have suffered death for their crimes, <lb/>
            others withdrew and are in exile-how comes it, you never <lb/>
            appeared as the accuser of any of them, never were seen to <lb/>
            express indignation at the wrongs of the state, notwithstand­ <lb/>
            ing that you are so eloquent and audacious, yet here you <lb/>
            have displayed a zeal for our interests, where it was necessary <lb/>
            for you to ill-use so many people ? Would you like, men of <lb/>
            Athens, that I should tell you the reason ? It is because <lb/>
            they1 share in the wrong which is done you by certain per­ <lb/>
            sons, while they embezzle a part of the taxes which are levied; <lb/>
            and so insatiable is their avarice, they make a double profit <lb/>
            of the commonwealth. For it is not more agreeable to quarrel <lb/>
            with a large number of petty offenders than with a small <lb/>
            number of great ones, and surely it is not more like a friend <lb/>
            of the people to notice the crimes of the many than those of <lb/>
            the few. But the reason is what I tell you. He knows that <lb/>
            he is one of that class of delinquents; and you he made no <lb/>
            account of, therefore he treated you in that way. For had <lb/>
            you acknowledged yourselves to be a community of bonds­ <lb/>
            men, instead of a people claiming empire over others, you <lb/>
            could not have endured, 0 Athenians, the insults which he <lb/>
            offered you in the market-place, when he was binding and <lb/>
            carrying to gaol both aliens and citizens, bawling in the <lb/>
            assemblies and on the platform, calling people slaves and <lb/>
            the sons of slaves, who were better and of better parentage <lb/>
            than himself, and asking if the prison was built to no <lb/>
            purpose. Yes, I should say it was, when your father went <lb/>
            dancing off with his fetters at the procession of the Dionysia.2 <lb/>
            The rest of his outrageous acts it would be impossible to <lb/>
            recount, they are so many in number. For all together <lb/>
            you should take vengeance to-day, and make him an example <lb/>
            to others, that they may conduct themselves with more <lb/>
            decency.</p>
          <p>But perhaps, notwithstanding these political faults, there <lb/>
            are other things which he has managed creditably. Nay: <note type="footnote"> 1 Androtion and persons like him: perhaps with an allusion to <lb/>
            Timocrates. See post, p. 161. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Ulpian says, that at this time the prisoners were let out of gaol to <lb/>
            enjoy themselves, and that Androtion's father availed himself of the <lb/>
            privilege to escape. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="160"/>
            his behaviour to you in everything else has been such, that <lb/>
            what you have heard are the smallest grounds for detesting <lb/>
            him. What would you have me speak of ? His repair of <lb/>
            the sacred utensils and his destruction of the crowns ? or his <lb/>
            famous manufacture of the plates ? Why for this, even if he <lb/>
            had done no other wrong to the commonwealth, it will appear <lb/>
            that he deserves to die three times over : for he is chargeable <lb/>
            with sacrilege and impiety and embezzlement and everything <lb/>
            that is most shameful. The greater portion of what he said <lb/>
            to deceive you I shall pass by. Under a pretext that the <lb/>
            leaves of the crowns were dropping off, and that they were <lb/>
            rotten from age, as if they had been made of violets or roses <lb/>
            and not of gold, he persuaded you to melt them down. And <lb/>
            then-although for the taxes he added a clause that the public <lb/>
            officer should be present, (an affectation of honesty, when every <lb/>
            one that paid them was sure to check the accounts;) for the <lb/>
            crowns which he broke up he did not apply the same rule, <lb/>
            but has himself been orator, goldsmith, treasurer, and check­ <lb/>
            ing-clerk. Now, if you required to be trusted in all that you <lb/>
            do for the state, you would not have been caught peculating <lb/>
            so clearly : but having defined what is just for the property- <lb/>
            tax, namely, that the state should not trust you but her own <lb/>
            servants, when it appears that in another affair, in the altera­ <lb/>
            tion of sacred properties, some of which were not consecrated <lb/>
            even in our own generation, ydu did not introduce the same <lb/>
            safeguard which you did in the case of the taxes, are not your <lb/>
            motives obvious ? I should imagine so.</p>
          <p>Again, men of Athens, look to futurity, and see what glo­ <lb/>
            rious and admirable public inscriptions he destroyed, and <lb/>
            what impious and shameful ones he has written in their place. <lb/>
            You must all have seen these inscriptions under the rings of <lb/>
            the crowns-" The allies crown the people of Athens for <lb/>
            valour and justice "-or-" The allies present as the prize of <lb/>
            victory to Pallas"—or naming the particular states—" Such <lb/>
            and such a people crown the Athenians, having been saved <lb/>
            by the Athenians"—as for example there was inscribed some­ <lb/>
            where-" The Eubœans having been delivered crown the <lb/>
            people of Athens" — and again — " Conon from the sea-fight <lb/>
            with the Lacedæmonians." Such were the inscriptions upon <lb/>
            the crowns. These, which for you were themes of honour <lb/>
            and emulation, by the destruction of the crowns have dis. <lb/>
             <pb n="161"/>
            appeared: and on the plates, which this impure wretch <lb/>
            ordered to be made in their stead, is written—" By the care <lb/>
            of Androtion." Yes! though for the crime of impudicity the <lb/>
            laws forbid him to enter the temples, his name is in the <lb/>
            temples engraved upon the plates. Like the former inscrip­ <lb/>
            tions—is it not ?-and a theme of equal glory for you !</p>
          <p>One may see therefore, three of the most disgraceful things <lb/>
            have been accomplished by them. The Goddess they have <lb/>
            despoiled of her crowns : in the state they have extinguished <lb/>
            an emulation fostered by deeds, of which the crowns while <lb/>
            they existed were a memorial: the dedicators they have <lb/>
            robbed of no small honour, the credit of being grateful for <lb/>
            obligations. Yet, after doing all this quantity of mischief, <lb/>
            they are so hardened and audacious, that they mention these <lb/>
            things as creditable acts of administration ; and the one <lb/>
            imagines that through his friend 1 he shall be spared by you, <lb/>
            while the other sits by, and does not sink for shame at his <lb/>
            performances. And he is not only so shameless in regard to <lb/>
            money-matters, but so stupid as not to know, that crowns <lb/>
            are a sign of merit, plates and the like are tokens of wealth, <lb/>
            and every crown, though it be small, has the same glory in it <lb/>
            as a large one; whereas, although cups and censers, if <lb/>
            exceedingly numerous, gild the possessors with a show of <lb/>
            opulence,2 yet if a man prides himself upon small matters, <lb/>
            so far from his obtaining honour on that account, he is <lb/>
            thought to be vulgar-minded.3 Androtion however has <lb/>
            destroyed the possessions of honour, and made those of <lb/>
            wealth insignificant and unworthy of you. And he did not <lb/>
            even see, that Athenians were never anxious for the acquire­ <lb/>
            ment of riches, but for that of renown were more ambitious <lb/>
            than for anything in the world. Here is the proof4-They <note type="footnote"> 1 Timocrates; who in this affair was Androtion's colleague. See the <lb/>

            once possessed greater wealth than any of the Greeks, but to <lb/>
            win renown they expended it all, and contributing out of <lb/>
            their private means, they never shrank from any peril in the <lb/>
            pursuit of glory. From which they have acquired for them­ <lb/>
            selves imperishable treasures, partly the remembrance of their <lb/>

            docks and porticoes, not a pair of little jars, or three or four <lb/>

            Syntax. 174. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 I take it, the orator uses an invidious term to describe heavy taxation, <lb/>
            without special reference to any particular impost. Tithe among the <lb/>
            Greeks was commonly charged upon the occupiers of public lands, and <lb/>
            taken from confiscated property or the spoils of war for a religious <lb/>
            offering. It was exacted by the Athenians, when they held Byzantium, <lb/>
            from merchant-ships entering the Bosphorus: of which I have spoken <lb/>
            in a former note (ante, p. 22). The subject is handled by Böckh in <lb/>
            his Public Economy of Athens (Transl. vol. ii. p. 39, &amp;c.), from which <lb/>
            the following is an extract: </note><note type="footnote"> " Wherever houses or stations for the collection of tenths, <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεκατευ­ <lb/>
            τήρια, δεκατηλόγια</foreign>, are mentioned, tolls collected at sea are always to be <lb/>
            understood, which required particular establishments of this descrip­ <lb/>
            tion. Therefore Pollux mentions the erection of them as an event which <lb/>
            only happened on particular occasions. But when farmers of tenths <lb/>
            and collectors of tenths, <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεκατω̑ναι, δεκατηλόγοι, δεκατευταί</foreign>, are men­ <lb/>
            tioned, duties of different descriptions may be understood. In the first <lb/>
            place, there were the tenths of the produce of the soil; we know, for <lb/>
            example, that this tax was collected in the governments of the satraps <lb/>
            as a distinct branch of revenue; it was also universally extended in <lb/>
            the tyrannies of Asia. The tyrant demanded the tenths from all his <lb/>
            subjects in his right as lord and master of the whole country, which he <lb/>
            only permitted to be occupied by his subjects upon payment of these <lb/>
            taxes. Of this kind are the Sicilian tenths, which were received by the <lb/>
            kings before that country fell into the hands of the Romans; and many <lb/>
            cases of the same duty occur in Greece Proper, as, for example, the tithes <lb/>
            of the corn at Cranon in Thessaly. Thus Pisistratus, as tyrant or <lb/>
            usurping proprietor of the country, subjected all the lands of the <lb/>
            Athenian citizens to a tithe, and incurred the hatred of his people by <lb/>
            this despotic measure. The Pisistratidæ did not abolish this tax, but <lb/>
            they lowered it to a twentieth. In the same manner in a republic <lb/>
            many estates were subject to this tax, as not being the freehold pro­ <lb/>
            perty of the possessor, but only held by him as occupier. Thus the <lb/>
            state of Athens was enabled to possess the tithes of public demesnes, <lb/>
            and to let them in farm. The temples also frequently enjoyed property </note> <lb/>

            would pray for, doubling the taxes, did they raise these sacred <lb/>
            ornaments : not by the help of such counsellors as you did <lb/>
            they carry on the government: but by overcoming their <lb/>
            enemies, doing what every prudent man would wish them to <lb/>
            do, uniting the people in harmony, while they expelled from <lb/>
            the market-place men that led such lives as you, they have <lb/>
            left behind them a fame that will never die. But you, my <lb/>
            countrymen, are so far gone in thoughtlessness and folly, that, <lb/>
            even with such examples before your eyes, you will not follow <lb/>
            them; but Androtion is repairer of your sacred utensils; <lb/>
            Androtion, 0 earth and heaven ! And can any impiety, think <lb/>
            ye, surpass this ? I look upon it, that a man who is to enter <lb/>
            the sanctuaries, to touch the baskets and holy water and <lb/>
            superintend the service of religion, ought not to be pure for <lb/>
            a stated number of days only, but to have been pure all his <lb/>
            lifetime from those practices in which the defendants life has <lb/>
            been passed. <note type="footnote"> of this kind, of which many examples are extant: thus, for instance, <lb/>
            the Delian Apollo received a large amount of tithes from the Cyclades; <lb/>
            and in the island of Ithaca the temple of Diana received the tithes <lb/>
            from an estate, the possessors of which were bound to keep her temple <lb/>
            in repair; and Xenophon had formerly devised the very same regula­ <lb/>
            tion at Scillus. Obligations of this nature arose in a great measure <lb/>
            from the piety of individuals who dedicated their property to the gods, <lb/>
            and thus gave up the right of possession, retaining at the same time <lb/>
            the use of it for themselves, in consideration of a fixed payment. The <lb/>
            temples may also on certain occasions have received the right of tithes <lb/>
            by conquest: thus the Greeks vowed, that after the fortunate termina­ <lb/>
            tion of the Persian war all states who had afforded any protection to <lb/>
            the enemy should pay a tithe to the Delphian Apollo, that is to say, <lb/>
            that they would make their lands subject to a tribute. At Athens <lb/>
            moreover Minerva of the Parthenon received the tithe of the plunder <lb/>
            and of captures, and also of certain fines; while others were paid to <lb/>
            the temples without any deduction, together with the tithe either of all <lb/>
            or of a large proportion of confiscated property. The tithes of Minerva <lb/>
            are mentioned in connexion with the fiftieths of other gods and of the <lb/>
            heroes of the tribes : the latter were probably similar percentages, and <lb/>
            must not be confounded with the customs-duty of the fiftieth." </note> <pb n="164"/>

          <p>ARISTOCRATES was the mover of that decree which the Athenians <lb/>
            passed in favour of Charidemus of Oreus, B. c. 352, of which, and of <lb/>
            the circumstances attending it, I have spoken fully in the Appendix <lb/>
            on the Thracian Chersonese in the First Volume. The exact terms <lb/>
            of the decree have not come down to us. Its professed objects were, <lb/>
            to reward Charidemus for his past services to Athens, and at the <lb/>
            same time to attach him more firmly to her interests and secure his <lb/>
            assistance for the future. It therefore contained (among other clauses) <lb/>
            one making his person inviolable, and declaring, " that whosoever <lb/>
            killed him might lawfully be arrested in any place within the limits <lb/>
            of the Athenian confederacy, and that any state or any individual <lb/>
            refusing to give up such person, or attempting to rescue him, should <lb/>
            be excluded from all the benefit of Athenian connexion."</p>
          <p>For this decree, as being impolitic and injurious to his country, as well <lb/>
            as contrary to the letter and spirit of her laws, Aristocrates was <lb/>
            indicted by one Euthycles, for whom Demosthenes composed the <lb/>
            present speech, which was spoken on the trial. We have no further <lb/>
            knowledge of either the prosecutor or the defendant than what we <lb/>
            obtain from the oration of Demosthenes. They were perhaps ob­ <lb/>
            scure persons put forward by the different political parties, one by <lb/>
            the supporters of Charidemus, the other by his adversaries. It <lb/>
            appears however that Euthycles had been employed on some naval <lb/>
            command in the Hellespont, and he may therefore have been con­ <lb/>
            versant with Thracian politics.</p>
          <p>The orator undertakes to establish three points : first, that the decree <lb/>
            was contrary to law; secondly, that Charidemus was unworthy of <lb/>
            the distinction conferred upon him; and thirdly, that it was impo­ <lb/>
            litic and dangerous to grant it. After a general opening of the case, <lb/>
            he proceeds to establish his first objection. As Charidemus had been <lb/>
            made a citizen of Athens, it became any one proposing a decree in <lb/>
            his favour to conform to the laws of Athens. This duty Aristocrates <lb/>
            had neglected. The Attic law provided, as was just, that the trial <lb/>
            and the punishment of homicide should vary according to the cir­ <lb/>
            cumstances of the case. Homicide might be voluntary, or it might <lb/>
            be accidental: in some cases it was perfectly justifiable, in others it <lb/>
            was excusable only. The party who committed it might be amenable <lb/>
            to death or exile; or required only to make atonement and obtain <lb/>
            purification; or entitled to an absolute acquittal. Even in cases of <lb/>
            wilful murder the guilty man could only be taken within the boun­ <lb/>
             <pb n="165"/>
            daries of Attica: if he went into exile, and kept aloof from the <lb/>
            Amphictyonic meetings and public games of Greece, it was not lawful <lb/>
            to molest him; for it was a sacred principle that an exile should not <lb/>
            be disturbed in his place of refuge. The Athenian law was so careful <lb/>
            to make proper distinctions between the different kinds of homicide, <lb/>
            that it had appointed different courts to try them. There was the <lb/>
            court of Areopagus, and the courts ad Palladium, ad Delphinium, ad <lb/>
            Prytaneum, and in Phreatto; all of which were founded in early <lb/>
            times, and were regarded with the highest respect and veneration by <lb/>
            the people. Each of them bad its own peculiar methods of proceed­ <lb/>
            ing adapted to the particular class of offences that came under its <lb/>
            jurisdiction. Aristocrates had confounded all these useful distinc­ <lb/>
            tions ; he had shown his contempt of the jurisprudence of his <lb/>
            country and of her ancient and valuable institutions, by directing <lb/>
            that any person killing Charidemus should be treated as a malefactor <lb/>
            of the most heinous kind, without regard to the circumstances of <lb/>
            the case. It was by no means unlikely that Charidemus, who was <lb/>
            at the head of a mercenary force, and accustomed to acts of aggres­ <lb/>
            sion and violence, might lose his life in some quarrel wantonly pro­ <lb/>
            voked by himself, in which, according to every principle of justice, <lb/>
            it would be lawful to resist him. Yet by this decree a man might <lb/>
            be punished who killed him in self-defence, or in resistance to some <lb/>
            outrageous attack upon his family or fellow-citizens. Again, by the <lb/>
            Athenian law punishment was not inflicted without trial and judg­ <lb/>
            ment : even a convicted murderer who returned from exile and, was <lb/>
            seen in the market-place must be taken to prison to be dealt with <lb/>
            according to law. Aristocrates authorized summary proceedings to <lb/>
            be taken against a party whose guilt was yet unproved, not for the <lb/>
            purpose of bringing him to trial, but in order to punish him without <lb/>
            trial. The offender was left to the mercy of the party by whom he <lb/>
            was apprehended, who might carry him to his own house, ill-treat <lb/>
            him in any way that he pleased, extort money from him, or even put <lb/>
            him to the rack. To prove the illegality of such proceedings, the <lb/>
            orator cites various clauses from the Athenian statute-book.</p>
          <p>Upon this part of the case we must caution the reader not to be misled <lb/>
            by the orator's vehement assertions, which, to say the least, are to <lb/>
            be viewed with great suspicion. We have not before us the whole <lb/>
            decree of Aristocrates, nor have we the advantage of seeing the argu­ <lb/>
            ments on the other side : we can form therefore only an imperfect <lb/>
            judgment from the fragments of the decree that are preserved to us. <lb/>
            These however do not of themselves bear the construction which the <lb/>
            orator puts upon them. They direct that any person killing Chari­ <lb/>
            demus may be seized and carried away, without saying whither or <lb/>
            for what purpose: yet we should rather suppose it to have been <lb/>
            intended, that he was to be brought to Athens for judgment, than <lb/>
            that the captor might take and do with him what he pleased ; and <lb/>
            such would be the more natural meaning of the words. If therefore <lb/>
            the clause in question has been fairly quoted, it would appear that, <lb/>
            while the framer of the decree laid himself open to just attack, and <lb/>
            perhaps even to legal penalties, for not defining his intentions in so <lb/>
            important a matter with greater clearness, the orator, in availing <lb/>
             <pb n="166"/>
            himself of this omission on the part of his adversary, has exaggerated <lb/>
            the fault, and represented as a wilful violation of law what in fact <lb/>
            was mere carelessness or inaccuracy.</p>
          <p>Another charge made against Aristocrates is, that he had infringed a <lb/>
            statute which expressly forbade the passing of any privilegium. The <lb/>
            laws were required to be the same for all. If a law could not be <lb/>
            passed which applied only to one individual, much less could a decree. <lb/>
            There was another statute which said, that no decree either of the <lb/>
            Council or the people should have more force. than the law; and this <lb/>
            too Aristocrates had broken. Further, his decree was contrary to <lb/>
            all the precedents in similar cases; and, considering that Charidemus <lb/>
            had become a citizen of Athens, there was the less reason why the <lb/>
            principles of the constitution should be departed from in his favour.</p>
          <p>After disposing of some frivolous pleas which he expected to be set up <lb/>
            by his adversary, the orator proceeds to what may be called the <lb/>
            general merits of the case, contending that Charidemus was in no <lb/>
            respect deserving of the honour which had been bestowed upon <lb/>
            him, and that it would lead to consequences most injurious to <lb/>
            Athens.</p>
          <p>Charidemus, he says, was a man of low origin and profligate character, <lb/>
            a reckless and unprincipled adventurer, who lent his services for hire <lb/>
            to those that paid him best, and never served any one but from base <lb/>
            motives of lucre. To confer extraordinary honours upon such a <lb/>
            person would be a disgrace to the Athenians, even if he had been <lb/>
            a useful auxiliary. But the fact was otherwise. Whenever they had <lb/>
            put any trust in him, he had betrayed them : he bad been, upon the <lb/>
            whole, one of their most insidious and determined enemies: and <lb/>
            though it was true, that he was on good terms with them at that <lb/>
            moment, they might be sure from their experience of his past con­ <lb/>
            duct, that he would take the first opportunity of turning against <lb/>
            them. To prove these charges, the orator enters upon a minute <lb/>
            examination of the life and actions of Charidemus; showing how he <lb/>
            was at first a common slinger, then he became the captain of a pirate <lb/>
            vessel, afterwards the leader of a band of mercenaries. Having entered <lb/>
            into the service of Iphicrates, he prevented the surrender of Am­ <lb/>
            phipolis to the Athenians by delivering up the hostages entrusted to <lb/>
            him by that general: he then went over to the Olynthians, and was <lb/>
            actually carrying succours to Amphipolis, when he was captured by <lb/>
            Timotheus and compelled to join him against his will. He promised <lb/>
            Cephisodotus, in return for some assistance lent him, that he would <lb/>
            recover the Thracian Chersonese for the Athenians; yet had no sooner <lb/>
            got out of his own difficulties by the aid of the Athenian commander, <lb/>
            than he accepted employment under Cotys king of Thrace, and <lb/>
            assisted him in besieging Else us and Crithote. After the death of <lb/>
            Cotys, he attached himself to Cersobleptes, whose sister he married, <lb/>
            and for whom he exerted himself, not only to acquire the dominion <lb/>
            of the Chersonese, but also the whole of the Thracian monarchy, to <lb/>
            the exclusion of Berisades and Amadocus, who were entitled to share <lb/>
            it with him. He treacherously attacked Cephisodotus, whom he had <lb/>
            promised to assist, forced him into a dishonourable convention, which <lb/>
            the Athenians were obliged to repudiate, and carried on war against <lb/>
             <pb n="167"/>
            them for seven months, until their commander Athenodorus, coa­ <lb/>
            lescing with Berisades and Amadocus, compelled him to sign a treaty <lb/>
            on behalf of Cersobleptes, by which it was agreed that Thrace should <lb/>
            be equally divided between the three princes, and the Chersonese <lb/>
            should be ceded to Athens. Even then he delayed the surrender of <lb/>
            the Chersonese, under one pretence or another, as long as he possibly <lb/>
            could, and would have evaded it altogether, had not Chares at length <lb/>
            been sent to the Hellespont with a strong fleet, which compelled him <lb/>
            to fulfil his engagement. The Athenians had thus recovered the <lb/>
            Chersonese by their own forces, not with the assistance of Chari­ <lb/>
            demus, as was falsely pretended by his supporters, but in spite of <lb/>
            all his efforts to the contrary. While the rest of the peninsula was <lb/>
            given up to them, Charidemus had taken care to reserve Cardia to <lb/>
            himself, with a manifestly insidious purpose. That city had always <lb/>
            been hostile to the Athenians, and aided Charidemus in all his enter­ <lb/>
            prises. It was from here that he was carrying succours to Amphipolis, <lb/>
            when he was taken prisoner by Timotheus. To the Cardians he had <lb/>
            delivered up Miltocythes, the pretender to the kingdom of Thrace, <lb/>
            and they had put him to a cruel death. Cardia was so situated as to <lb/>
            be the key of the Thracian Chersonese, and the possession of it would <lb/>
            enable Cersobleptes at any time to attack the peninsula. That such <lb/>
            a project was in contemplation, might be inferred from certain secret <lb/>
            negotiations which Charidemus had lately carried on with Philip of <lb/>
            Macedon, when that king advanced to Maronea, and would very likely <lb/>
            have joined Cersobleptes and the Cardians, had not Amadocus refused <lb/>
            him a passage through his territory.</p>
          <p>It appeared from all this that Charidemus, so far from deserving reward <lb/>
            for any service he had done to the Athenians, ought to be contented <lb/>
            if he escaped punishment at their hands. He was at best a time- <lb/>
            server, who could not safely be trusted: but it was pretty evident <lb/>
            that, being the general and prime minister of Cersobleptes, his real <lb/>
            design was to forward the ambitious schemes of that monarch, and <lb/>
            he was only biding his time to do it effectually. The true policy of <lb/>
            the Athenians was to keep the kingdom of Thrace divided, so that <lb/>
            each of the rival princes might court their friendship, and none of <lb/>
            them be strong enough to disturb their possessions in the Hellespont. <lb/>
            If Thrace were united under one powerful king, he would be sure to <lb/>
            invade the Chersonese, as Cotys had done. The object of the present <lb/>
            decree was, to enable Charidemus to carry his arms against Ama­ <lb/>
            docus and the sons of the deceased Berisades : for if his person were <lb/>
            declared inviolable by an Athenian decree, the supporters of the <lb/>
            rival princes, who were friends of Athens, would be deterred from <lb/>
            making any opposition to him. It would be urged on the other side, <lb/>
            that it was not the interest of Cersobleptes to subdue the Chersonese, <lb/>
            because then the Athenians would close his seaports by means of <lb/>
            their navy, and be would lose more revenue by that than he would <lb/>
            gain by the Increase of territory. They should bear in mind how­ <lb/>
            ever, that ambitious potentates were not always guided by discreet <lb/>
            views of their true interests, any more than they were by regard to <lb/>
            honesty and good faith. Of this they had ample evidence in the <lb/>
            measures pursued by Cotys and by Philip. Their only prudent <lb/>
             <pb n="168"/>
            course was to put it out of the power of such persons to do them <lb/>
            an injury.</p>
          <p>Independently of the special reasons against this decree furnished by <lb/>
            the past history of Charidemus and by his present position and con­ <lb/>
            nexions, it was wrong and foolish to confer such honours upon a <lb/>
            stranger, who neither resided among them, nor had any ties binding <lb/>
            him to the country. Friendships with men like him could not be <lb/>
            depended on. They courted the Athenian people and obtained the <lb/>
            grant of citizenship for their own private ends; but they had little <lb/>
            respect for the principles of the Athenian constitution, and they as <lb/>
            readily attached themselves to other states, when they saw their <lb/>
            advantage in it. Thus Python, the murderer of Cotys, was made <lb/>
            a citizen of Athens; but afterwards, finding it suited him better, he <lb/>
            went over to the king of Macedon and became his minister. There <lb/>
            were other men who had at least as good a claim as Charidemus to <lb/>
            this extraordinary protection; for example, Athenodorus, Simon <lb/>
            and Bianor; Menestratus of Eretria, Phayllus the Phocian. But <lb/>
            where was the thing to stop ? The Athenians would be constituting <lb/>
            themselves a sort of body-guard to every mercenary leader who <lb/>
            happened at any time to be their ally. He (Euthycles) had not <lb/>
            opposed the grant of citizenship and a golden crown to Charidemus, <lb/>
            because there was no such great harm in conferring a mere honorary <lb/>
            distinction, and, whatever his private convictions were, he felt that <lb/>
            opposition to the general feelings of the people would have been <lb/>
            certainly fruitless, and might have been deemed vexatious. Now <lb/>
            however, when they proposed to put power into the hands of such <lb/>
            a man, and to pass a measure which would enable him to pursue his <lb/>
            mischievous designs with impunity, he could be silent no longer. <lb/>
            It would be urged perhaps, that an adverse decision might make <lb/>
            Charidemus their enemy, when he was inclined to be their friend: <lb/>
            to which the answer was, that, if Charidemus was really disposed to <lb/>
            befriend their commonwealth, he would endeavour to prove it by his <lb/>
            future actions, and in the meantime it was better to convince him <lb/>
            that they were not to be deluded by idle professions.</p>
          <p>It was highly important that the Athenians should reform their ways <lb/>
            both in regard to rewards and punishments; that they should be <lb/>
            more sparing of the former, and more strict and severe in dealing <lb/>
            with those who injured the commonwealth. Their ancestors re­ <lb/>
            warded none but men of signal merit; and them they did not reward <lb/>
            extravagantly; and, what was still more important, they admitted <lb/>
            no former merits to be an excuse for subsequent demerit, but even <lb/>
            their most distinguished citizens, such as Themistocles and Cimon, <lb/>
            they visited with heavy penalties when they misconducted themselves. <lb/>
            In later times the honours of the Athenian republic had been <lb/>
            lavished indiscriminately upon all sorts of persons. The conse­ <lb/>
            quence was, they had become cheap : there was but little encourage­ <lb/>
            ment to honest men to do real service to their state, and the receivers <lb/>
            of their franchise and their crowns, so far from being grateful for <lb/>
            them, were ready to desert and betray them for the slightest cause. <lb/>
            It was discovered that the meanest people could obtain an honorary <lb/>
            decree through the influence of venal orators, who served their own <lb/>
             <pb n="169"/>
            interests at the expense of the state: and, while in the time of their <lb/>
            ancestors it was the republic that was wealthy and prosperous, now <lb/>
            the people of Athens were content to see a few individuals raised to <lb/>
            wealth and eminence, and to leave all the powers of government in <lb/>
            their hands. Their decline from the spirit of ancient times could not <lb/>
            be more strikingly exemplified than by this decree in favour of a <lb/>
            man, whom third-rate cities of Greece would have thought it dis­ <lb/>
            graceful to elevate to such high dignity, and who in Oreus, his own <lb/>
            native place, was not admitted even to the privileges of a freeborn <lb/>
            citizen.</p>
          <p>He concludes with a brief recapitulation of the laws which Aristocrates <lb/>
            had infringed.</p>
          <p>This oration is justly ranked among the most important which have <lb/>
            come down to us, on account of the valuable imformation which it <lb/>
            furnishes respecting the affairs of Thrace and the Chersonese, and <lb/>
            the light which it throws upon the criminal jurisprudence of Athens.</p>
          <p>LET none of you, 0 Athenians, imagine that I am here from <lb/>
            motives of personal enmity to accuse the defendant Aristo­ <lb/>
            crates, or that upon the discovery of some small and trifling <lb/>
            error I am rushing eagerly into a quarrel. Unless I am mis­ <lb/>
            taken in my views and calculations, I am exerting myself for no <lb/>
            other object than that you may hold the Chersonese in safety, <lb/>
            and may not again by trickery be deprived of it. If you <lb/>
            wish therefore to understand these matters correctly, and to <lb/>
            give a just and legal decision upon the indictment, you <lb/>
            should not only attend to the words of the decree, but con­ <lb/>
            sider their probable consequences. Could you have seen <lb/>
            through the artifice upon the first hearing, you would per­ <lb/>
            haps not have been deceived at all: but as this is one of <lb/>
            the frauds practised by certain people, to move and frame <lb/>
            decrees in such a way that you may suspect nothing and be <lb/>
            thrown off your guard, you must not be greatly surprised, <lb/>
            if we can show this decree to be so framed, that, while it <lb/>
            appears to give a personal protection to Charidemus, it de­ <lb/>
            prives the commonwealth of her really sure and effectual <lb/>
            means of protecting the Chersonese. You ought indeed, 0 <lb/>
            Athenians, to give me your attention, and to hear what I say <lb/>
            with favour. For when, without being one of your eternal <lb/>

            of your power and lend me a willing ear, you will not only <lb/>
            secure yourselves against this danger, but encourage any of <lb/>

            us who believe we can render service to the stated We shall <lb/>
            believe so, if we see it is not difficult to obtain an audience with <lb/>
            you. Many now being afraid of this, not clever speakers <lb/>
            perhaps, but better men than those who are, it never enters <lb/>
            their heads to consider any public question. I myself-by <lb/>
            all the Gods, I assure you—should have shrunk from pre­ <lb/>
            ferring this indictment, only I thought it would be highly <lb/>
            disgraceful to keep quiet and hold my tongue now, when <lb/>
            I see people contriving a measure injurious to Athens—I <lb/>
            that formerly, when I sailed as commander to the Hellespont, <lb/>
            spoke out and accused certain persons whom I believed to <lb/>
            have done you wrong.</p>
          <p>I am aware that some people consider Charidemus to be a <lb/>
            benefactor of the republic. I think however that, if I can <lb/>
            give the explanations which I propose, and tell you what <lb/>
            I know him to have done, I shall prove not only that he is <lb/>
            no benefactor, but that he is the most malignant enemy, and <lb/>
            has got a very different character from what he deserves. If <lb/>
            this, men of Athens, had been the gravest offence of Aristo­ <lb/>
            crates, to have made provision by decree for such a person as <lb/>
            I will prove Charidemus to be, giving him special and extra- <lb/>
            legal retribution for any injury that he may suffer, I should <lb/>
            have addressed you upon that point immediately, to convince <lb/>
            you that he is far from deserving to obtain such a decree. <lb/>
            There is however a still greater injustice effected by the <lb/>
            decree, which you should first be informed of and on your <lb/>
            guard against.</p>
          <p>I must first of all state and explain, what it is that has <lb/>
            enabled you to hold the Chersonese securely: by such in- <note type="footnote"> 1 In the translation of <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρα̑γμα τηλικου̑τον πεπραγμένον</foreign>—<foreign xml:lang="grc">του̑τό τε <lb/>

             <pb n="171"/>
            formation you will also clearly see the wrong which has been <lb/>
            done. The cause, men of Athens, is this-that upon the <lb/>
            death of Cotys three princes instead of one succeeded to the <lb/>
            kingdom of Thrace, namely, Berisades, Amadocus, and Cer­ <lb/>
            sobleptes: consequently they have been rivals to each other, <lb/>
            but have caressed and courted you. Certain people, 0 <lb/>
            Athenians, wishing to put an end to this, to destroy the <lb/>
            other princes, and to put the whole monarchy into the hands <lb/>
            of Cersobleptes, contrive to obtain this resolution of Council ; <lb/>
            by the terms of which indeed they were far from appearing <lb/>
            to have any such design, though in fact they were using all <lb/>
            their efforts to forward it, as I shall prove. For when <lb/>
            Berisades, one of the princes, died, and Cersobleptes, violating <lb/>
            his oaths and the treaty which he made with you, levied war <lb/>
            upon Amadocus and the sons of Berisades, it was evident <lb/>
            that Athenodorus would assist the sons of Berisades, and that <lb/>
            Simon and Bianor would assist Amadocus: for the former is <lb/>
            connected by marriage with Berisades, as the latter are with <lb/>
            Amadocus. They looked therefore for the best means of <lb/>
            compelling those generals to keep quiet, of isolating the rival <lb/>
            princes, and thus enabling Charidemus, who was striving to <lb/>
            win the monarchy for Cersobleptes, to get everything firmly <lb/>
            into his power. The best way was, first for your decree to <lb/>
            be obtained, making any one who killed him liable to arrest; <lb/>
            secondly, for Charidemus to be elected general by you. For <lb/>
            Simon and Bianor, who had been made citizens, and who, <lb/>
            independently of that, were devoted to you, would not be in <lb/>
            a hurry to take the field against your general; and Atheno­ <lb/>
            dorus, who was a citizen by birth, would never think of such <lb/>
            a thing, and never expose himself to a charge under the <lb/>
            decree, which would be sure to be advanced against them, if <lb/>
            anything happened to Charidemus. By such means, the <lb/>
            princes being destitute of support, and impunity being secured <lb/>
            for themselves, they hoped easily to expel them and get pos­ <lb/>
            session of the kingdom.</p>
          <p>That such was their expectation and such their contrivance, <lb/>
            the facts are sufficient to prove. For at the very time when <lb/>
            they were themselves commencing war, there came as am­ <lb/>
            bassador from them to you this Aristomachus of Alopece, <lb/>
            who in his address to the assembly, besides praising Cerso­ <lb/>
            bleptes and Charidemus in general terms, and declaring how <lb/>
             <pb n="172"/>
            friendly their feelings were to you, said that Charidemus was <lb/>
            the only person able to recover Amphipolis for the common­ <lb/>
            wealth, and advised you to elect him general. This resolution <lb/>
            of Council had already been concerted and prepared by them, <lb/>
            so that, in case you should be prevailed upon through the <lb/>
            hopes and promises which Aristomachus held out, the assem­ <lb/>
            bly might immediately ratify it, and nothing should stand in <lb/>
            the way. Let me ask; how could any people have more <lb/>
            artfully or cunningly devised a plot for the expulsion of the <lb/>
            rival princes and the subjugation of the whole empire under <lb/>
            one whose cause they espoused, than by so contriving matters, <lb/>
            that the persons who would be likely to assist the two should <lb/>
            be intimidated and shrink from the vexatious proceedings <lb/>
            which they must expect to be taken against them by <lb/>
            virtue of this decree, while he that was trying to get the <lb/>
            kingdom for one and working for everything opposed to your <lb/>
            interests had an ample licence given him to effect his purposes <lb/>
            securely ? And not only from this is it evident that the <lb/>
            resolution of Council was moved for the reasons which I state, <lb/>
            but the decree itself affords a pretty strong piece of evidence. <lb/>
            After the words " if any one shall kill Charidemus," omitting <lb/>
            to state what Charidemus must be doing at the time, whether <lb/>
            acting for your advantage or otherwise, he has immediately <lb/>
            added, “ that he may be apprehended1 in the territory of your <lb/>
            allies." Now no man who is alike our enemy and his will <lb/>
            ever come to our allies, whether he has killed Charidemus or <lb/>
            not; so that this penal clause has not been framed against <lb/>
            such a party. One that feared the decree, and was careful <lb/>
            not to incur our certain enmity, would be a person friendly <lb/>
            to us and opposed to him in the event of his attempting <lb/>
            anything against us. Such persons are Athenodorus, Simon, <lb/>
            Bianor, the Thracian princes, all who would wish to oblige <lb/>
            you by checking Charidemus in any hostile attempt.</p>
          <p>The object then for which the resolution of Council was <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἀγώγιμον ἐκ τω̑ν συμμάχων</foreign>. The full signification of these words <lb/>
            is : " liable to be seized and carried prisoner out of the territory of <lb/>

              moved, that the people under delusion might confirm it, and <lb/>
              the reason why we have preferred this indictment, wishing to <lb/>
              prevent such a result, I have told you, men of Athens. <lb/>
              Perhaps, as I have undertaken to prove three things, first, <lb/>
              that the decree has been moved in violation of the laws, <lb/>
              secondly, that it is disadvantageous to the commonwealth, <lb/>
              thirdly, that the party for whom it has been drawn is un­ <lb/>
              worthy to obtain such honours, it is right that I should give <lb/>
              to you my hearers the option, what you would like to hear <lb/>
              first, what second, and what last. Consider then which you <lb/>
              would like, that I may begin with that. Do you wish me to <lb/>
              begin with the breach of law?1 Then to that I will address <lb/>
              myself. But I have one thing to request, to entreat of you <lb/>
              all-and it is reasonable, I am sure—Don't let any of you, <lb/>
              men of Athens, out of a jealous feeling because he has been <lb/>
              deceived in Charidemus and thinks him a benefactor, listen <lb/>
              with less favour to my discourse about the laws: don't let <lb/>
              him on that account deprive himself of the power to vote <lb/>
              conscientiously, or me of the right to open my whole case to <lb/>
              you as I please: but let him give me his attention thus-and <lb/>
              see how fairly I will put it. When I am speaking about the <lb/>
              laws, irrespective2 of the person in whose favour the decree <lb/>
              has been moved and of his character, look whether it has <lb/>
              been moved contrary to the laws or in accordance with them, <lb/>
              and look at nothing else. When I bring his deeds home to <lb/>
              him, and explain the manner in which he has deceived you, <lb/>
              look at the facts, whether I state them truly or falsely. When <lb/>
              I discuss whether or no it is expedient for the commonwealth <lb/>
              to pass this decree, lay aside everything else, and consider <lb/>
              whether my reasoning upon the question is sound or unsound. <lb/>
              If you listen to me in this temper of mind, you will your­ <lb/>
              selves more fully comprehend what is necessary, looking at <lb/>
              each point singly, and not trying a heap of questions at once; <lb/>
              and I shall be able to explain what I want more easily. Upon <lb/>
              every point I shall be brief.</p>
          <p>Now take and read the laws themselves, that out of their <lb/>
            very language I may show the illegality which has been <lb/>
            committed. <note type="footnote"> 1 Here we are to suppose the jury gave token of assent. See ante, <lb/>

            <title type="sub">ONE OF THE LAWS OF HOMICIDE FROM THE AREOPAGUS:</title>
          </ab>
          <p>“ The Council of Areopagus shall have cognizance of <lb/>
            murder, and wounding with malicious intent, and arson, and <lb/>
            poisoning, if any one shall kill another by giving poison."</p>
          <p>Stop. You have heard both the law and the decree,1 men <lb/>
            of Athens. I will tell you how, as it appears to me, you will <lb/>
            most easily comprehend the arguments on the point of ille­ <lb/>
            gality. You must look what is the position of the man, in <lb/>
            whose favour the decree has been moved; whether he is an <lb/>
            alien, or a resident alien, or a citizen. If we call him a <lb/>
            resident alien, we shall not be speaking the truth; if an <lb/>
            alien, we shall not be acting justly; for the people's grant, by <lb/>
            which he has become a citizen, ought to stand good. We <lb/>
            must treat him therefore in argument, it seems, as a citizen. <lb/>
            And only see how fairly and equitably I will deal with the <lb/>
            question: for, while I rank him in that class in which he will <lb/>
            obtain the highest honour, I don't consider that privileges, <lb/>
            which even we native citizens do not enjoy, ought in con­ <lb/>
            tempt of the laws to be accorded to him. What privileges <lb/>
            do I mean ? Those which the defendant has inserted in his <lb/>
            decree. It is written in the law, that the Council shall have <lb/>
            cognizance of murder, and wounding with malicious intent, <lb/>
            and arson, and poisoning, if any one shall kill another by <lb/>
            giving poison. And the legislator having premised, " if any <lb/>
            one shall kill," has nevertheless ordered a trial, before saying <lb/>
            how the author of the deed is to be punished; herein, men <lb/>
            of Athens, exercising a wise forethought for the religion of <lb/>
            the whole state. How so ? It is impossible for all of us to <lb/>
            know who the murderer is. To believe therefore any such <lb/>
            charges without trial, he thought would be monstrous; and he <lb/>
            considered that, since it is we who will have to avenge the <lb/>
            sufferer, we must be satisfied and convinced by proof that the <lb/>
            accused party is guilty; for then is it righteous, to punish, <lb/>
            when we are acquainted with the facts, and not before. More­ <lb/>
            over he reckoned that all such expressions as " if one shall <lb/>
            kill," “ if one shall commit sacrilege," “ if one shall commit <lb/>
            treason," and the like, before trial are terms of accusation <note type="footnote"> 1 The decree of Aristocrates, set forth in the indictment, which was <lb/>
            read by a clerk of the court to the jury at the commencement of the triaL </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="175"/>
            only, after trial and conviction they become crimes. With a <lb/>
            term of accusation he thought it proper to associate not <lb/>
            punishment, but trial. And therefore he enacted that, if any <lb/>
            man shall kill another, the Council shall have cognizance, and <lb/>
            I did not state what he is to suffer upon conviction. Thus did <lb/>
            the legislator express himself: how did the author of the <lb/>
            decree ? “ If any one shall kill Charidemus,” he says-the <lb/>
            misfortune he has described in the same terms as the legis­ <lb/>
            lator, “ if any one shall kill”— but he does not go on in the <lb/>
            same manner: he has done away with all judicial hearing, <lb/>
            and made the party liable to immediate arrest; in contempt <lb/>
            of the tribunal appointed by law, he has given over without <lb/>
            trial to his accusers, to be dealt with according to their plea­ <lb/>
            sure, a person whose guilt is not yet clear. And when they <lb/>
            have taken him, it will be lawful for them to torture or to <lb/>
            beat or to exact money from him.1 But all these things are <note type="footnote"> 1 It is impossible, as I have already intimated in the Argument, to <lb/>
            extract from the words of the decree, which are here cited, the meaning <lb/>

            words of Demosthenes, was doubtless occasioned by the fallacious <lb/>
            reasoning which runs through all the first part of the oration. Demo­ <lb/>
            sthenes, instead of simply objecting that the decree did not specify <lb/>
            where the prisoner was to be taken and what was to be done with <lb/>
            him, asserts that it positively authorized the illegal and oppressive <lb/>
            measures which are mentioned in the text. As Auger properly puts it: <lb/>
            " Comme l'auteur du décret, après ces mots, pourra être saisi, n'ajoutoit <lb/>

            the decree which made against the author, and that, if he has. omitted <lb/>
            to notice any clauses, it was probably because they were unfavourable <lb/>

          <p>You have heard the law, men of Athens. Look and ob­ <lb/>
            serve, how wisely, how piously the legislator has drawn it. <lb/>
            Murderers, he says. In the first place, by a murderer he <lb/>
            means one who has been found guilty by verdict: for no one <lb/>
            falls under that designation, before he has been convicted and <lb/>
            found guilty. Where does he show this ? Both in the former <lb/>
            law and in the present. In the former, after the clause " if <lb/>
            any one shall kill," he added “ the Council shall have cog <lb/>
            nizance:" in this, after naming the murderer, he has de­ <lb/>
            clared what he ought to suffer. Where the thing was <lb/>
            accusation only, he has directed the trial; but where the <lb/>
            term has become properly applicable to a convict, he has <lb/>
            ordained the punishment. He must therefore be speaking of <lb/>
            convicted parties. And what says he? That it shall be <lb/>
            lawful to kill or to take into custody. Does it mean, to the <lb/>
            captor's own house, or as he pleases ? No such thing. How <lb/>
            then? As is directed in the tablet, he says. And what is <lb/>
            that ? What you all know. The Judges have authority to <lb/>
            punish with death those who are in exile for murder; and <lb/>
            you all saw the person in the assembly last year carried on: <lb/>
            by them to prison. It is to them therefore that he orders <lb/>
            the party to be taken. And how does this differ from taking <lb/>
            him to the captor's own house ? He that takes off the <lb/>
            offender to the Judges, men of Athens, gives all power over <lb/>
            him to the laws; he that carries him to his own house gives <lb/>
            the power to himself. In the former case the punishment <lb/>
            may be such as the law prescribes; in the other case, such as <lb/>
            the captor pleases: and surely it makes a vast difference, <lb/>
            whether the law has authority to inflict punishment, or <lb/>
            whether an enemy has. " But not to ill-treat nor to amerce," <lb/>
            it says. What mean those expressions ? By not ill-treating, <lb/>
            a term undoubtedly familiar to all, he means not to scourge, <lb/>
            not to shackle, not to do anything of that sort: and by not <lb/>
            amercing, not to exact pecuniary penalties; for the ancients <lb/>
            called a pecuniary penalty an amercement. Thus has the <lb/>
            law defined how a murderer and a convict must be punished, <lb/>
            and where, naming the country of the sufferer; and has post- <note type="footnote"> VOL. III. </note> <note type="footnote"> N </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="178"/>
            lively declared that it shall be in no other manner but that, <lb/>
            and nowhere else but there. The author of the decree how­ <lb/>
            ever is far from having defined it thus: in fact he has said <lb/>
            quite the contrary; for after writing " if any one shall kill <lb/>
            Charidemus," “ it shall be lawful," he adds, to apprehend him <lb/>
            in any place." What mean you? When the laws do not <lb/>
            permit even convicts to be taken into custody except in our <lb/>
            own territory, do you allow a man without trial to be appre­ <lb/>
            hended in all the domain of our confederacy? And when the <lb/>
            laws do not sanction the arrest even in our own territory, do <lb/>
            you authorize it to be effected everywhere? Moreover, in <lb/>
            making the offender liable to be arrested, you have allowed <lb/>
            everything which the law has forbidden; to extort money, to <lb/>
            ill-treat and torment him in his lifetime, to keep him in pri­ <lb/>
            vate custody and put him to death. Could any conviction <lb/>
            for an illegal motion be clearer than this ? Could there be <lb/>
            a conviction for a more shameful decree? For, when there <lb/>
            were two expressions open to your choice, one applicable to <lb/>
            parties accused, " if any one shall kill," another to convicted <lb/>
            parties, “ if any one shall be a murderer," in your description <lb/>
            you adopted the term for a person under accusation, but you <lb/>
            pronounce against untried parties a sentence which the laws <lb/>
            do not pass even upon the condemned; and the intermediate <lb/>
            proceedings you suppressed: for between accusation and con­ <lb/>
            viction is trial, which the defendant has nowhere introduced <lb/>
            in his decree.</p>
          <p>Read the laws following:-</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">THE LAW.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>“ And if any one shall kill a murderer or be the cause of <lb/>
            his death, whilst he keeps away from the border-market 1 and <lb/>
            from the games and Amphictyonic sacrifices, such person <lb/>
            shall be liable to the same penalties as if he had killed an <lb/>
            Athenian; and the Fifty-one2 shall decide."</p>
          <p>You ought to be informed, 0 Athenians, what was the <lb/>
            intent of him that framed the laws: and you will see how <note type="footnote"> 1 This, as the orator himself shows, was a place on the confines of <lb/>
            two neighbouring states, where the borderers met for the purpose of <lb/>
            traffic. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The Ephetæ, of whose criminal jurisdiction I shall speak in <lb/>
            Appendix VIIL </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="179"/>
            cautiously and conformably to legal principles he defined <lb/>
            everything. If any one shall kill a murderer, (he says,) or <lb/>
            be the cause of his death, whilst he keeps away from the <lb/>
            border-market and from the games and Amphictyonic sacri­ <lb/>
            fices, such person shall be liable to the same penalties as if <lb/>
            he had killed an Athenian; and the Fifty-one shall decide. <lb/>
            What does all this mean? He considered that, if a man <lb/>
            who has fled from his country on a charge of murder and <lb/>
            been condemned has once escaped and saved himself, though <lb/>
            he ought to be expelled from the native land of his victim, <lb/>
            it is not righteous to kill him in every place. What was the <lb/>
            legislator's view? That, if we slay people who have fled to <lb/>
            other countries, others will slay those who have fled to <lb/>
            Athens. And should this be the case, the only refuge that <lb/>
            is left for the unfortunate will be abolished. What is this? <lb/>
            The power of removing from the land of the murdered to <lb/>
            a land where none have been injured, and there dwelling in <lb/>
            security. To prevent what I say, and in order that the <lb/>
            avenging of misfortunes may not be endless, he wrote—“ if <lb/>
            any one shall kill a murderer whilst he keeps away from <lb/>
            the border-market "-those are his words: meaning what? <lb/>
            From the borders of the country. For there, as it appears <lb/>
            to me, our own people and the neighbours adjoining used in <lb/>
            ancient times to assemble; whence he has called it border- <lb/>
            market. And again, "from the Amphictyonic sacrifices.” <lb/>
            Wherefore, I ask, did he exclude a murderer from these <lb/>
            too? He banishes the culprit from everything in which the <lb/>
            deceased in his lifetime had a part: first, from his country <lb/>
            and all things in it either sacred or profane, assigning the <lb/>
            border-market as the limit from which he declares him <lb/>
            .excluded: next, from the sacrifices of the Amphictyons; for <lb/>
            in them, if the deceased was a Greek, he had a part. And <lb/>
            from the games. On what account? Because the games in <lb/>
            Greece are open to all, and by virtue of the general right the <lb/>
            deceased had access to them also. Therefore also from them <lb/>
            Jet him keep away. From all these places he banishes the <lb/>
            murderer. But if any one shall kill him elsewhere, out of <lb/>
            the excepted places, the legislator has given the same redress <lb/>
            as in the event of killing an Athenian. For he did not <lb/>
            describe the exile by the name of the state, with which he <lb/>
            has no communion, but by that of the crime with which he <note type="footnote"> N2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="180"/>
            has made himself chargeable; and therefore he says, " if any <lb/>
            one shall kill a murderer." Then, after stating from what <lb/>
            he must be excluded, in order to impose the sentence legally <lb/>
            he mentioned the name of the state—“let him be subject to <lb/>
            the same penalties as if he were to kill an Athenian ”— <lb/>
            speaking a different language, 0 Athenians, from the mover <lb/>
            of this decree. Is it not cruel, when the law has allowed <lb/>
            men to live safely in exile, on condition of their avoiding the <lb/>
            places which I have mentioned, to propose that they shall be <lb/>
            delivered up, and to rob them of that benefit of mercy which <lb/>
            the unfortunate may fairly claim from those whom their <lb/>
            crimes concern not; it being uncertain, in the darkness of <lb/>
            our future destinies, for which among us all the benefit is <lb/>
            reserved. And now, should the slayer of Charidemus (sup­ <lb/>
            posing such an event really to happen) be slain in return by <lb/>
            any persons to whom he is surrendered, after he has gone <lb/>
            into exile and keeps aloof from the forbidden places, they <lb/>
            will themselves be amenable to the penalties of murder, and <lb/>
            so will you, Aristocrates: for it is written, “ if any one be <lb/>
            the cause," and you will be the cause, having given the <lb/>
            sanction of your decree. Well then: if we let you alone in <lb/>
            such a case, we shall be living in company with men pol­ <lb/>
            luted ; if we take proceedings against you, we shall be forced <lb/>
            to act contrary to our own determinations. Is it a slight <lb/>
            or trivial ground that you have for setting aside the decreed</p>
          <p>Now read the next law:</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">THE LAW.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>“ If any one beyond the boundaries shall pursue or seize <lb/>
            or carry off1 any homicide who has quitted the country, <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φέρη̩ ἢ ἄγη̩</foreign>. Pabst: gewaltsam behandelt und beraubt. Auger: <lb/>
            “ saisira, emmenera;" which I take to be more correct. The phrase <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄγειν καὶ φέρειν</foreign> undoubtedly signifies " to plunder," " to rob and pill," as <lb/>
            Spenser has it. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἄγειν</foreign> is properly applicable to the living booty, <foreign xml:lang="grc">φέρειν</foreign> <lb/>
            to the inanimate; but the two verbs together are used in a loose sort <lb/>
            of way, as if they were equivalent to <foreign xml:lang="grc">λη</foreign>ḯ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ζεσθαι</foreign>, with an accusative of <lb/>
            the people or country pillaged: as in Xenophon, Hellen. ii. c. 2, s. 11, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">φέροντας καὶ ἄγοντας τὴν</foreign> ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ιωνίαν</foreign>. Similarly we have <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄγειν καὶ καίειν</foreign>. <lb/>
            (Ibid. c. 2, s. 5.) Here however it is different. Each of the verbs <lb/>
            denotes a laying of violent hands upon the person, <foreign xml:lang="grc">φέρη̩</foreign> perhaps im­ <lb/>
            porting a ruder kind of treatment' than <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄγη̩</foreign>. Some confirmation of <lb/>
            this view is afforded by the passage below (p. 639 of the Greek text </note> <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BOHN_19_fig23.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>

              whose property is not forfeit, he shall incur the same <lb/>
              penalties as if he did the like in our own territory.” 1</p>
          <p>Here, men of Athens, is another law humanely and wisely <lb/>
            framed, which the defendant will be shown to have trans­ <lb/>
            gressed likewise. “ If any one "-it says-,, shall so treat <lb/>
            any homicide who has quitted the country, whose property <lb/>
            is not forfeit." It means one who has withdrawn on account <lb/>
            of an involuntary homicide. By what does this appear? <lb/>
            First, by its saying “ who has quitted the country," and not <lb/>
            “ who is in exile;" secondly, by the definition, "whose pro­ <lb/>
            perty is not forfeit;" for the estate of those who commit <lb/>
            homicide by design is confiscate. Therefore the legislator <lb/>
            must be speaking of involuntary homicides. And what are <lb/>
            his words ? “ If any one beyond the boundaries "-he says <lb/>
            -" shall pursue or seize or carry off." And what means <lb/>
            this expression beyond the boundaries?” The boundary­ <lb/>
            line for all homicides is exclusion from the country of <lb/>
            the deceased. From this he permits them to be chased <lb/>
            and taken into custody, but beyond the limits he allows <lb/>
            neither to be done. And if any one acts contrary to this, <lb/>
            he has given the same redress as if he injured the party <lb/>
            while staying at home, declaring that he shall incur the like <lb/>
            penalty as if he did it at home. Now were Aristocrates the <lb/>
            defendant to be asked, (and don't think it a foolish question,) <lb/>
            first-if he knows whether any one will kill Charidemus or <lb/>
            whether he will come to some other end-he would answer <lb/>
            probably, that he did not know. We will assume however <lb/>
            that some one will kill him. Again, do you know, Aristo­ <lb/>
            crates, whether the person who is to do it will be a voluntary <lb/>
            or an involuntary agent, an alien or a citizen ? It is impos­ <lb/>
            sible for you to say that you know. Then surely you ought <lb/>
            to have added these particulars, saying, "if any one shall <note type="footnote"> <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ φέρουσι χρήματ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἰτου̑ντες</foreign>. Here the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄγουσι καὶ φέρουσι</foreign> express <lb/>
            the seizure and detention of the persons, <foreign xml:lang="grc">χρήματ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἰτου̑ντες</foreign> the purpose <lb/>
            of such violence. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φόνος</foreign> signifies every kind of homicide, whether voluntary or acci­ <lb/>
            dental, whether justifiable or criminal. In this law therefore, which, <lb/>
            according to the argument of Demosthenes, applies only to involuntary <lb/>
            homicide, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνδροφόνος</foreign> cannot be translated murderer, as in the previous <lb/>
            laws : for murder in our law signifies always, “ the killing a man un­ <lb/>

            done, he might have had justice according to law; but de­ <lb/>
            oidedly not, after a mere term of accusation, to have added <lb/>
            “ let him be liable to arrest." For what boundary have you <lb/>
            left by this clause, when the law quite plainly prohibits all <lb/>
            pursuit beyond the boundaries, and yet you allow arrest in <lb/>
            any place ? And the law forbids not only pursuit, but even <lb/>
            arrest, beyond the boundaries: whereas by your decree any <lb/>
            one who pleases may get a man who, has unintentionally <lb/>
            taken life delivered into his hands, and carry him by force <lb/>
            into the country of the deceased. Do you not confound all <lb/>
            human judgment, and exclude the motives according to <lb/>
            which every action is honourable or disgraceful?2 You <lb/>
            see, Athenians, that so it is not-merely upon questions of <lb/>
            homicide but upon all questions :—“ If a man commits an <lb/>
            assault, being the aggressor," the law says; implying that, <lb/>
            if he defended himself, he is not guilty. “ If a man speaks <lb/>
            abusive words”—“ which are false," the lawgiver adds; as <lb/>
            much as to say that, if they are true, it is justifiable. " If <lb/>
            a man kills another by design;" as much as to say that, if <lb/>
            he does so unintentionally, it is different. “ If one damages <note type="footnote"> 1 According to Markland, who is followed by Taylor and Reiske, the <lb/>

          <p>Read the law that follows :</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">THE LAW.1</title>
          </ab>
          <p>“And no persons shall be liable to any legal proceedings <lb/>
            for homicide, who exhibit an information against exiles, in <lb/>
            case any one return whither it is not lawful."</p>
          <p>This, men of Athens, is a law of Draco ; so are all the <lb/>
            laws of homicide which I have cited; and you must <lb/>
            look at his meaning. Those who exhibit an information <lb/>
            against murderers returning whither it is not lawful, he <lb/>
            says, shall not be liable to proceedings for homicide. Here <lb/>
            he declares two principles of law, both of which the defendant <lb/>
            has violated in his decree : first, he allows one to exhibit <note type="footnote"> 1 This law, says Taylor, is to be taken in connexion with that which <lb/>
            is cited above, p. 631 of the Greek text, p. 178 of this translation. <lb/>
            It having there been enacted, that whoever kills or causes the death of <lb/>
            a murderer, whilst he keeps away from Athens and the other specially <lb/>
            forbidden places, shall be liable to the ordinary punishment for killing <lb/>
            an Athenian citizen; it is here declared that, if a man exiled for murder <lb/>
            returns to Athens, and an information be exhibited against him. (which <lb/>
            was the proper and legal course to be taken against him in such case,) <lb/>
            the party who exhibits the information shall not be subject to the <lb/>
            penalties of the former law, even though he cause the accused to be <lb/>
            put to death. It may seem to have been unnecessary to introduce this <lb/>
            saving clause ; for, if the process in question was authorized by law, it <lb/>
            would be absurd to hold that the party instituting it could be liable to <lb/>
            punishment. We must suppose then, either that it was adopted ex <lb/>
            abundanti cauteM, as the lawyers say; or that the object was to protect <lb/>
            the informer against the penalties of homicide, even though the party <lb/>
            informed against should suffer unjustly by the law which he set in <lb/>
            motion, leaving him at the same time liable to other penalties. The <lb/>
            Athenians, like the rest of the Greeks, were anxious to prevent the <lb/>
            return of all such persons as were exiled for state-crime or murder. <lb/>
            A part of the Heliastic oath was : <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐδὲ</foreign> rovs <foreign xml:lang="grc">φεύγοτας κατάξω, οὐδὲ ὦν <lb/>

            an information against the murderer, but not to carry him <lb/>
            off in one's own custody ; secondly, even this he only allows <lb/>
            when a man returns where it is not lawful, not in any place <lb/>
            that he goes to. And where is it not lawful to go ? To the <lb/>
            city from which he is exiled. Where does he very plainly <lb/>
            show this? "In case any one return," he says. This <lb/>
            cannot be referred to any other than the city from which <lb/>
            a man is exiled : for it is impossible surely to return to one <lb/>
            from which you were never banished at all. The law there­ <lb/>
            fore has allowed an information, and only in case a man <lb/>
            returns where it is not lawful: Aristocrates has it-let him <lb/>
            be subject to arrest even in places to which no law forbids <lb/>
            him to flee.</p>

              sthenes has not explained this clause, as he has the other parts of the <lb/>

              declares, under what circumstances it shall be lawful to. <lb/>
              kill, the defendant overlooked all this, and has inserted <lb/>
              the penal clause without mentioning how the death is <lb/>
              effected. Yet mark how fairly and righteously all the dis­ <lb/>
              tinctions were drawn by their author. He laid it down, <lb/>
              that it was no crime to kill a man in a prize-fight. Why ? <lb/>
              He looked not at the event, but at the intention of the <lb/>
              party. And what is this? To vanquish without taking <lb/>
              life, not to kill. If the adversary was too weak to endure <lb/>
              the struggle for victory, he considered that he was the <lb/>
              cause of his own misfortune, and therefore allowed him no <lb/>
              redress. Again-,, if in battle by mistake," he says-such <lb/>
              a person also shall be deemed pure. Properly: for if I <lb/>
              destroyed a man supposing him to be one of the enemy, <lb/>
              I deserve, not to be brought to trial, but to obtain for­ <lb/>
              giveness. " Or catching with his wife," he says, “or with <lb/>
              his mother, or sister, or daughter, or with a concubine whom <lb/>
              he keeps to beget free-born children”—one that kills on any <lb/>
              of these accounts1 he lets off with impunity, acquitting him, <lb/>
              0 Athenians, with the most perfect justice. Wherefore so ? <lb/>
              In defence of those for whom we fight with the enemy, to <lb/>
              protect them from insult and indignity, he allows us to <lb/>
              kill even our own people, if they insult and outrage them <lb/>
              contrary to law. For since there is no race of friends and <lb/>
              foes, but it is their actions that make the one and the other, <lb/>
              the law permits us to punish as enemies those who commit <lb/>
              acts of hostility. It is monstrous then, when there are <lb/>
              so many causes for which it is lawful to kill other men, <lb/>
              that Charidemus should be the only person in the world <lb/>
              whom even for these causes it is not lawful to kill.</p>
          <p>Suppose it should happen to Charidemus, as doubtless it <lb/>
            has happened to others before now; that he should quit <lb/>
            Thrace and take up his abode in some city, where, though <lb/>
            no longer possessing that authority by which he does so <lb/>
            many things forbidden by the laws, he will be driven to <lb/>
            make the attempt by the force of his habits and desires: <lb/>
            won't people be obliged to submit to his outrages in silence ? <lb/>
            At least it will not be safe to kill him, or to seek the <note type="footnote"> * 'Eri <foreign xml:lang="grc">τΟύτων τψ</foreign>. So Pabst: unter solchen Umstanden. Yet perhaps <lb/>

            met with the objection-where can such things take place ?— <lb/>
            What prevents me also saying, who can slay Charidemus 1 <lb/>
            However, don't let us look at that: but, since the decree <lb/>
            that we are trying was passed, not on account of anything <lb/>
            which had taken place, but to provide for something which <lb/>
            no one is sure ever will take place, let the chance of the <lb/>
            future be common to both; to this let us conform our <lb/>
            expectations humanly, and look at it as if both the one <lb/>
            contingency and the other may possibly happen.1 At all <lb/>
            events, if you rescind the decree, should any disaster befal <lb/>
            Charidemus, you have the means which the laws give to <lb/>
            avenge him : if you let it stand, in case he should injure <lb/>
            any one in his lifetime, the legal remedy of the oppressed <lb/>
            is gone. In every way therefore the decree is opposed to <lb/>
            the laws, and it is your interest to set it aside.</p>

            punishable."</p>
          <p>Here are other causes for which it is lawful to take life. <lb/>
            If a man resisting any unlawful seizure or violence shall <lb/>
            immediately kill the aggressor, he orders that the death shall <lb/>
            not be punishable. Pray observe, how wisely. By his <lb/>
            having first mentioned the causes for which life may be <lb/>
            taken, and then adding the "immediately," he left no time <lb/>
            for contriving any foul play : by the word “ resisting," it <lb/>
            is clear that he gives the power to the aggrieved party, <lb/>
            not to any one else. The law has therefore given permission <lb/>
            to kill immediately in self-defence; Aristocrates has it <lb/>
            simply, "if any one shall kill," even though with justice <lb/>
            or as the laws allow. Oh, but we are cavilling; for whom <lb/>

            likewise, and his property shall be forfeit."</p>
          <p>You have heard the law, 0 Athenians, saying positively- <lb/>
            whatever person, whether he be a magistrate or in a private <lb/>
            station, shall cause this statute to be defeated, or shall alter <lb/>
            it, let him be disfranchised and his children likewise, and <lb/>

            framer of the law took small or slight pains to establish its <lb/>
            validity, and to prevent its being defeated or altered ? Never­ <lb/>
            theless Aristocrates the defendant, but little regarding him, <lb/>
            does alter and defeat it. For what is altering but this ; <lb/>

            many more, which I have not exhibited on account of the <lb/>

            the laws concerning the courts of homicide, which require <lb/>
            the parties to be summoned or to give testimony or make <lb/>

            of an oath, but immediately after the charge the punishment <lb/>
            is ordered, and one too which the laws prohibit, what else <lb/>
            can one say ? All these proceedings take place before five <lb/>
            courts, as appointed by the laws. But perhaps it may be <lb/>
            said-the courts are of no account, and are not founded in <lb/>
            justice, whereas the defendant's ordinances are just and <lb/>
            honourable. Quite the contrary. I don't know that there <lb/>
            has ever been a decree passed in Athens more shameful than <lb/>
            the defendant's; while, of all tribunals that exist among <lb/>
            mankind, none can be shown more august or equitable than <lb/>
            these. I would briefly advert to certain facts, the mention of <lb/>

            which you will be better pleased to hear. I will begin with <lb/>
            that which will throw the fullest light upon the subject, after <lb/>
            referring to the grant which has been made to Charidemus.</p>
          <p>We, men of Athens, created Charidemus a citizen, and by <lb/>
            means of such grant we admitted him to civil and religious <lb/>
            communion, to partake in our legal rights, in all that <lb/>
            we ourselves enjoy. There are many institutions among <lb/>
            us of a character not to be found elsewhere, but one there <lb/>
            is the most peculiar of all, and the most highly venerable, <lb/>
            the court of Areopagus, respecting which we have more <lb/>
            glorious traditions and myths, and more honourable testi­ <lb/>
            monies of our own, than we have of any other tribunal; 1 <lb/>
            of which it is proper you should hear one or two by <lb/>
            way of example. In ancient times, as we are informed by <lb/>
            tradition, the Gods in this tribunal alone deigned both to <note type="footnote"> and more peculiarly to the solemn oath sworn in cases of homicide, of <lb/>

              demand and to render justice for murder, and to sit in <lb/>
              judgment upon disputes between each other; so says the <lb/>
              legend : Neptune demanded justice of Mars on behalf of his <lb/>
              son Halirrhothius,1 and the twelve Gods sat in judgment <lb/>
              between the Furies and Orestes. Such are its ancient <lb/>
              glories : now for those of later date.</p>
          <p>This tribunal neither despot nor oligarchy nor democracy <lb/>
            has ventured to deprive of its jurisdiction in murder: all <lb/>
            people consider that any process of their own invention <lb/>
            would be less efficacious than that devised by the Areopa­ <lb/>
            gites. In addition to such important facts, here only has <lb/>
            it occurred that neither a convicted criminal nor a defeated <lb/>
            prosecutor ever established a charge against the propriety of <lb/>
            the verdict. 2 In contempt of this jurisdiction and of the <lb/>
            legal remedies attached to it, the author of the present <lb/>
            decree has empowered Charidemus in his lifetime to do what <lb/>
            he pleases, and, in case any disaster should befal him, has <lb/>
            given the means of persecution to his friends.</p>
          <p>Just consider. Of course you all know that in the Areo­ <lb/>
            pagus, where the law allows and requires proceedings to <lb/>
            be taken for murder, in the first place the party who charges <lb/>
            another with any such crime will make oath with impreca­ <lb/>
            tions upon himself and his family and his house ; in the <lb/>
            next place it is no ordinary oath that he has to swear, but <lb/>
            such as is taken upon no other occasion; for he must stand <lb/>
            upon the entrails of a boar and a ram and a bull,3 and they <lb/>
            must have been immolated by the proper persons and on <note type="footnote"> 1 Mars killed him, according to the fable, to avenge the violence <lb/>

            the appointed days, so that both in regard to the time and <lb/>
            the officiating persons every due solemnity may have been <lb/>
            observed. And even then the party who has sworn such <lb/>
            an oath is not yet believed, but, in case he should be con­ <lb/>
            victed of untruth, he will carry away the curse of perjury <lb/>
            upon his children and his family, and that is all he will get <lb/>
            by it. If his accusation be considered just, and he obtain a <lb/>
            conviction for murder, even then he gets no power over the <lb/>
            condemned, who for punishment is given up to the laws <lb/>
            and to the persons charged with that office : he may behold <lb/>
            the condemned suffering the penalty which the law imposes, <lb/>
            but nothing further. Such is the duty assigned to the <lb/>
            prosecutor : the accused has to take the oath in like manner, <lb/>
            but, after he has delivered his first speech, he is at liberty <lb/>
            to withdraw, and neither the prosecutor nor the judges nor <lb/>
            any persons whatever have authority to prevent him. How <lb/>
            comes it to be so, men of Athens ? Because they that made <lb/>
            the ordinances originally, whoever they were, whether Heroes <lb/>
            or Gods, did not press upon the unfortunate, but humanely, <lb/>
            as far as they could with propriety, alleviated their miseries. <lb/>
            All these regulations, so fair and so equitable, the framer of <lb/>
            the present decree is shown to have infringed; for not a <lb/>
            single portion of them is adopted in his decree.</p>
          <p>First therefore this one tribunal, its written laws and <lb/>
            unwritten usages, have been violated by the decree.</p>
          <p>A second tribunal also, the court of Palladium,1 for the <lb/>
            trial of involuntary homicide, he supersedes, as I shall show, <lb/>
            and infringes the laws which are administered in it. For <lb/>
            here the practice is, first for the parties to swear, then to <lb/>
            plead, and lastly for the court to decide : of which there is <note type="footnote"> 1 Of the jurisdiction of these four courts, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ἐπὶ Παλλαδίω̢, τὸ ἐπὶ <lb/>

            nothing in this man's decree. If the accused be convicted <lb/>
            and found to have done the deed, neither the prosecutor <lb/>
            nor any one else has power over him, but only the law. <lb/>
            And what does the law command ? That one convicted of <lb/>
            involuntary homicide shall on certain stated days leave the <lb/>
            country by an appointed road, and remain in exile until he <lb/>
            has appeased certain of the relatives of the deceased :1 then <lb/>
            it permits him to return, not anyhow, but in a particular <lb/>
            manner, ordering him to sacrifice and to be purified, and <lb/>
            giving some other directions what must be done. Rightly, <lb/>
            O men of Athens, does the law prescribe all this. For it is <lb/>
            just to make the penalty of unintentional homicide less <lb/>
            than that of intentional; and it is right to provide security <lb/>
            for leaving the country before banishment; and for the <lb/>
            returning exile to make atonement and purify himself by <lb/>
            certain ceremonies, and for everything to be under the <lb/>
            control of the laws, this and all of it is reasonable. Yet all <lb/>
            these arrangements, planned so wisely by the original legis­ <lb/>
            lators, the defendant in framing his decree disregarded.</p>
          <p>Here then have we two tribunals of high dignity and <lb/>
            importance, and usages handed down from time immemorial, <lb/>
            which he has impudently overridden.</p>
          <p>THere is also a third tribunal, one of the most awful <lb/>
            sanctity, where a man acknowledges that he killed, but <lb/>
            contends that he has done it lawfully. This is the court <lb/>
            of Delphinium. It appears to me, men of the jury, that <lb/>
            they who originally settled the law upon these subjects <lb/>
            inquired in the first instance, whether no homicide could <lb/>
            be deemed rightful, or whether a certain kind ought to be <lb/>
            so deemed; considering then that Orestes, acknowledging to <lb/>
            have killed his mother, gets a tribunal of Gods to try him <lb/>
            and is acquitted, they held that some kind of homicide was <lb/>
            justifiable ; for Gods would certainly not give a wrong verdict. <lb/>
            Having come to that opinion, they defined in precise terms <lb/>
            the causes for which it was lawful to kill. Aristocrates how­ <lb/>
            ever makes no exception, but simply declares that, if any <lb/>
            one shall kill Charidemus, (even though justly or as the laws <note type="footnote"> 1 Pabst: his er eine Person aus der Familie dies Ermordeten für sick <lb/>
            gewonnen hat. Schaefer is inclined to read <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἰδέη̣</foreign>, as the middle verb <lb/>
            is elsewhere applied to the relatives forgiving the culprit. (See p. 645.) <lb/>
            I don't agree with him. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="192"/>
            allow,) he must be given up. Now to all actions and words <lb/>
            there are two possible predicates,1 namely of just and unjust. <lb/>
            No single action or word can have both of them at the same <lb/>
            time ; (for how could the same thing be at once just and <lb/>
            not just?) but everything, before trial is supposed to have <lb/>
            one or the other; 2 if it appear to have the quality of in­ <lb/>
            justice, it is set down as base, if of justice, as honourable <lb/>
            and good. You however attached neither of those conditions <lb/>
            to the clause " if any one shall kill but having expressed <lb/>
            the charge itself indefinitely, and having added immediately <lb/>
            after,, “ that he may be lawfully apprehended," you have <lb/>
            clearly treated this third tribunal and its Usages with <lb/>
            contempt.</p>
          <p>There is a fourth besides these, the court in the Pry­ <lb/>
            taneum, whose jurisdiction is as follows. If a stone or a <lb/>
            piece of wood or iron or anything of the kind falls and strikes <lb/>
            a man, and we are ignorant who threw it, but know and <lb/>
            have in our possession the instrument of death, proceedings <lb/>
            are taken against such instruments here. If then it is not <lb/>
            right that inanimate and senseless things, when they lie under <lb/>
            such a charge, should be left untried, surely it is impious <lb/>
            and dreadful, that one who is possibly innocent, but who <lb/>
            (assuming him to be guilty) is at all events a human being <lb/>
            and gifted by fortune with the same nature as ourselves, <lb/>
            should upon such a charge without hearing and judgment <lb/>
            be given up to his accusers.</p>
          <p>There is yet a fifth tribunal, which he has failed to respect, <lb/>
            and I beg you to observe its character. It is that in <lb/>
            Phreatto. Here, men of Athens, the law requires a person <lb/>
            to take his trial, who has been exiled for involuntary homi­ <lb/>
            cide, and, before those who caused his banishment have <lb/>
            pardoned him, incurs the charge of wilful murder. And the <lb/>
            framer of these several ordinances did not, because it was <lb/>
            impossible for the criminal to come to Athens, overlook his <lb/>
            case, nor, because he had done some such act before, did he <note type="footnote"> 1 Pabst: Es Bind für alle menschliche Thaten und Reden zwei Seiten, <lb/>
            möglich eine rechtliche und eine rechtswidrige. </note><note type="footnote"> Auger: If Toute action et toute parole sent toujours accompagnées <lb/>

             <pb n="193"/>
            at once take a -similar charge against him for granted ; but <lb/>
            he founds means to keep religion unprofaned, and did not <lb/>
            deprive the criminal of a hearing, and trial. What did he <lb/>
            then? He brought the judges to a spot to which the <lb/>
            criminal might repair, appointing a certain place in Attica <lb/>
            by the seaside, called Phreatto. The accused then sails up <lb/>
            in a vessel and pleads, without touching the land; the judges <lb/>
            hear and decide on shore. And if he is found guilty, he <lb/>
            suffers the punishment of wilful murder, justly; if he is <lb/>
            acquitted, he escapes that penalty, but undergoes the exile <lb/>
            for his former homicide. Why, let me ask, have these <lb/>
            arrangements been made so carefully? The .contriver of <lb/>
            them thought it was the same impiety to leave a guilty man <lb/>
            at large, and to give up an innocent man for punishment <lb/>
            before trial. Now, if for already declared homicides such <lb/>
            anxiety is shown, that they may obtain a hearing and a trial <lb/>
            and everything that is fair upon a subsequent charge, surely <lb/>
            in the case of a man who has not been convicted, on whom <lb/>
            no judgment has been passed, whether or no he did the <lb/>
            deed, whether intentionally or unintentionally, it is out­ <lb/>
            rageous to frame a decree for giving him up to his accusers.</p>
          <p>In addition to all these legal remedies, there is -also a <lb/>
            sixth, which the defendant has equally set at nought by his <lb/>
            decree. If a man has been ignorant of all the other courses, <lb/>
            or if the times within which they must each be pursued <lb/>
            have gone by, or if for any reason whatever, he does not <lb/>
            choose to adopt these methods of prosecution, but sees the <lb/>
            homicide walking about in the temples and the market, <lb/>
            it is lawful to carry him off to prison, but not to his own <lb/>
            house or where he pleases, as you have allowed. And when <lb/>
            he is brought to prison, he will suffer nothing there before <lb/>
            trial, but, if he is found guilty, he will be punished with <lb/>
            death; if the person who arrested him fails to get a fifth <lb/>
            part of the votes, he will be mulcted in a thousand drachms. <lb/>
            Aristocrates orders nothing of this kind, but that the one <lb/>
            party may accuse without risk, and the other be given up <lb/>
            instantly without trial. And if any persons or even a whole <lb/>
            community shall interfere, to prevent the destruction of all <lb/>
            these usages which I have enumerated, the abolition of all <lb/>
            these tribunals which I have spoken of, which Gods estab­ <lb/>
            lished, and to which men have been resorting ever since, and <note type="footnote"> VOL. III. </note> <note type="footnote"> o </note> <lb/>

            shall rescue the party thus illegally attacked and outraged, <lb/>
            he has put in a clause to excommunicate thorny nor does he <lb/>
            allow even them a hearing or a trial, but punishes them <lb/>
            without trial immediately. How could there be a more <lb/>
            shameful decree than this, or a more illegal one ?</p>
          <p>Have we any law yet remaining ? Show me. There is <lb/>
            one. Recite it.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">THE LAW.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>“If any one shall die a violent death, his relations shall be <lb/>
            entitled to take hostages in that behalf, until they have <lb/>
            either submitted to judgment for the homicide, or given up <lb/>
            the authors of it. And the taking of hostages shall extend <lb/>
            to three, but not beyond."</p>
          <p>There are many good laws, 0 Athenians, but I don't know <lb/>
            that any is better or juster than this. Only see how equit­ <lb/>
            ably, how very humanely it is drawn. “ If any man shall <lb/>
            die a violent death," it says. First then, by adding this <lb/>
            word “ violent," he has given us an indication that he means <lb/>
            " if unjustly." The relations, he says, shall be entitled in that <lb/>
            behalf to take hostages, until they have either submitted to <lb/>
            judgment for the homicide or given up the authors of it. <lb/>
            Look how fairly. First he requires them to submit to judg­ <lb/>
            ment ; secondly, if they do not like this, he orders them to <lb/>
            give up the author ; if they will not do either of these things, <lb/>
            he says, the taking of hostages shall extend to three, but not <lb/>
            beyond. Well then : every part of this law is contravened <lb/>
            by the decree. For in the first place he writes, " if any one <lb/>
            shall kill," but does not add unjustly," or "violently," or <lb/>
            anything at all. In the next place, before any demand of <lb/>
            satisfaction, he orders that the party may be immediately <lb/>
            apprehended. And in addition to this, while the law directs <note type="footnote"> 1 ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Εκσπονδον ἔγραψεν ε</foreign>î<foreign xml:lang="grc">ναι</foreign> Pabst: erklärt ihn für ausgeschlossen von <lb/>

            neither submit to judgment nor give up the authors of the <lb/>
            crime, they shall be liable to have hostages taken from them <lb/>
            to the number of three; Aristocrates lets them go un­ <lb/>
            punished, nay, he has left them out of account altogether; <lb/>
            but those who have harboured a man already in exile, (for <lb/>
            so I will assume,) according to the universal law which per­ <lb/>
            mits the receiving of an exile, he excludes from all connexion <lb/>
            with Athens, if they will not deliver up the suppliant for <lb/>
            punishment. Therefore, by his having no proviso as to the <lb/>
            mode of killing, and by his not directing any trial or any <lb/>
            demand of satisfaction, and by his allowing arrest in any <lb/>
            place whatever, and by his punishing those that harbour and <lb/>
            not those among whom the disaster occurred, in short by <lb/>
            everything it is quite manifest, that here is another law <lb/>
            violated by his decree.</p>

            forbidden by the Twelve Tables, as Cicero tells us, Orat. pro Domo, 17 : </note><note type="footnote"> " Quo jure, quo more, quo exemplo, legem nominatim de capite civis <lb/>

            an individual, such as the bills of pains and penalties with which extra­ <lb/>

            as to the propriety of which I shall refer the reader to Hallam's Con­ <lb/>

            " There is a still more unreasonable method than this, which is called <lb/>
            making of laws ex post facto : when after an action (indifferent in itself) <lb/>

            been a crime, and inflicts a punishment upon the person who has com­ <lb/>

          <p>The law which has just been read is not another of the <lb/>
            laws of homicide, men of the jury, yet it is fully as good, <lb/>
            if any law ever was so. For the proposer of it thought that, <lb/>
            as other constitutional rights are equally shared by all, so <lb/>
            ought every man to share equally in the laws; and therefore <lb/>
            he made it unlawful to propose any statute applying to a <lb/>
            particular man, unless the same should apply to all Athe­ <lb/>
            nians. Since then it is admitted that decrees ought to be <lb/>
            framed according to the laws, a man who draws a special <lb/>
            one in favour of Charidemus, which will not extend to all <lb/>
            of you, clearly must have moved in contravention of this <lb/>
            law. For it can never be constitutional to put that in <lb/>
            a decree, which cannot even be the subject of a statute.</p>

            have greater authority than a law." <note type="footnote"> action, innocent when it was done, should be afterwards converted to <lb/>
            guilt by a subsequent law; he had therefore no cause to abstain from <lb/>
            it, and all punishment for not abstaining must of consequence be cruel <lb/>
            and unjust." To which he adds in a note, “ Such laws among the <lb/>
            Romans were denominated Privilcgia.” Strictly however Privilegium, <lb/>
            was a general term, corresponding to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">νόμος</foreign> in <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνδρὶ τεθεὶς</foreign> of the <lb/>
            Athenian, which might be a law either for the advantage or the disad­ <lb/>
            vantage of the party concerned. A law passed for a man's benefit, <lb/>
            though undeserved, could scarcely be so odious as one passed for the <lb/>
            opposite purpose; and hence the term came to have a one-sided <lb/>
            application. ' </note><note type="footnote"> It does not appear to me that Demosthenes makes a fair use of the <lb/>
            statute which he quotes. It is true indeed that all laws should as far <lb/>
            as possible be general in their application, and we might well expect <lb/>
            that it would be the policy of the Athenians to observe such a rule. <lb/>
            When however it is contended, that, as there cannot be a law affecting <lb/>
            an individual only, à fortiori there cannot be a decree for such a purpose, <lb/>
            this I take to be a fallacy. To grant special honours, privileges, or <lb/>
            immunities for some extraordinary merit or service, becomes necessary <lb/>
            occasionally in all states, and was, as we know, the practice of the <lb/>
            Athenians. Now the proper way of effecting this object was to pass, <lb/>
            not a law, but a decree, in order to preserve that very distinction be­ <lb/>
            tween laws and decrees which Demosthenes himself so strongly insists <lb/>
            upon. In England peculiar powers or privileges are conferred by <lb/>
            private Acts of Parliament. At Athens there was no such thing as a <lb/>
            private statute. The same purpose could be effected by a decree. </note><note type="footnote"> Even a privilegium might be obtained by the suffrages of six thou­ <lb/>
            sand citizens voting by ballot. (See Andocides De Mysteriis, 87, Ed. <lb/>
            Bekker.) Demosthenes cites only a part of the law. </note> <pb n="197"/>
            </p>
          <p>Put it down. It will be short and easy work, I expect, <lb/>
            men of the jury, to show that this law has been violated by <lb/>
            the decree. For when there are so many laws, and when <lb/>
            a man has prepared a motion in defiance of them all, and <lb/>
            included a private concern in a decree, how can it be doubted <lb/>
            that he requires a decree to have greater authority than a <lb/>
            law ?</p>
          <p>I wish also to show you one or two of the decrees which <lb/>
            have been drawn up for real benefactors of the commonwealth, <lb/>
            that you may see it is easy to frame just resolutions, when <lb/>
            the sole purpose of framing them is to honour a man and <lb/>
            impart to him the rights that we enjoy ourselves, not under <lb/>
            the show of doing this to practise trickery and fraud. Read <lb/>
            these decrees. That it may not be long for you to hear, <lb/>
            from each of the decrees is selected just that part which <lb/>
            concerns my charge against the defendant, Read.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[Extracts are here read from various decrees.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>You see, men of Athens, that all have drawn them up in <lb/>
            the same manner : (let there be the same redress for him, it <lb/>
            says, as if the party killed an Athenian:) leaving your <lb/>
            existing laws upon this head in force, and even setting off <lb/>
            their dignity, since they esteemed it as a boon to allow any <lb/>
            one to share them. Not so Aristocrates. He vilifies them <lb/>
            as much as he possibly can ; (certainly he treated them as <lb/>
            worthless when he took pains to draw a special decree :) and <lb/>
            even disparages the grant, by which you have bestowed <lb/>
            citizenship upon Charidemus. For, as if you were only too <lb/>
            happy and even owed him an obligation, he has proposed <lb/>
            that you should guard his person, so that he may do what <lb/>
            he likes with impunity. Is not this acting as I say ?</p>
          <p>I know, men of Athens, Aristocrates will not be able to <lb/>
            show that he has not plainly transgressed the laws by his <lb/>
            decree, but will endeavour to keep out of sight the most <lb/>
            grievous of his delinquencies, namely, his not having in the <lb/>
            whole of his decree appointed any trial of such a charge. I <lb/>
            do not deem it necessary to say much upon this point, but I <lb/>
            will show clearly from the decree itself, that even he does <lb/>
            not suppose there is any trial for the accused party. For he <lb/>
            has it-" if any one shall kill Charidemus, he may be law­ <lb/>
            fully apprehended, and if any people shall rescue him, <lb/>
             <pb n="198"/>
            whether they be individuals or a community, they shall be <lb/>
            excluded from our connexion "-not, unless they surrender <lb/>
            for trial the party rescued, but absolutely at once. Now, if <lb/>
            he were allowing a trial and not taking it away, he would <lb/>
            have put in the penal clause against the rescuers, in the <lb/>
            event only of their not producing the rescued party for trial.</p>
          <p>I believe that he will urge this plea also, and try hard to <lb/>
            mislead you by it-that the decree is of no effect, for it is <lb/>
            an order of Council, and the law declares that resolutions of <lb/>
            the Council shall be in force for a year, so that, even if you <lb/>
            acquit him now, the state will suffer no detriment by the <lb/>
            decreed In answer to which I would have you remember- <lb/>
            Aristocrates drew this decree, not that it might be void and <lb/>
            thus no harm should befal you, (for he could have abstained <lb/>
            from drawing any at all, if he had the good of the common­ <lb/>
            wealth in view,) but that you might be deluded and certain <lb/>
            people execute projects adverse to your interests. The <lb/>
            parties who have indicted the decree and caused delay, and <lb/>
            through whom it is invalid, are we. It would be absurd <lb/>
            then, if that for which thanks is due to us should be the <lb/>
            safety of our opponents. Nor indeed is the thing so simple <lb/>
            as one imagines. If there was no one else that would draw <lb/>
            decrees like him without regard to your interests, the thing <lb/>
            would have been less serious perhaps : but, as there are <lb/>
            many such persons, it is not well for you to leave the decree <lb/>
            unrepealed. For who will not draw decrees boldly in future, <lb/>
            when this one is adjudged blameless? Who will refuse to <lb/>
            ask your votes upon them ? Who will indict them ? You <lb/>
            have not therefore to consider, whether this decree is void by <lb/>
            lapse of time, but to reflect that by your verdict upon this, <lb/>
            if you pronounce it legal, you will give impunity to men <lb/>
            who may wish to wrong you hereafter. <note type="footnote"> 1 The supposed argument of Aristocrates would be indeed absurd. <lb/>
            For if the jury acquitted him upon his trial, the decree would be pro­ <lb/>
            nounced legal and remain in force : if either he declined to support it, <lb/>
            or a verdict were found against him, then the decree certainly would <lb/>
            have had no more effect than a Probouleuma, but that, as the orator <lb/>
            says, would be owing entirely to the prosecution, and no thanks for it <lb/>
            to Aristocrates. One is inclined to think that Demosthenes is here <lb/>
            raising up a straw, in order to blow it down again : yet it is difficult to <lb/>
            judge how far it might be necessary to caution the jurors even against <lb/>
            so gross a fallacy. </note> <pb n="199"/>
            </p>
          <p>Again, Athenians : it has not escaped me that Aristocrates, <lb/>
            having no straightforward or honest defence to urge, will <lb/>
            resort to fallacies of this kind-that similar decrees have <lb/>
            been drawn up by many persons before. This, men of <lb/>
            Athens, is no proof that the defendant has made a legal <lb/>
            motion; as there are many causes through which you have <lb/>
            often been ied into error. For example : if any one of the <lb/>
            condemned decrees had not been indicted before you, it <lb/>
            would have been in force, I presume: and yet it must <lb/>
            have been moved contrary to law. Or, if any was indicted, <lb/>
            but either by the collusion of the prosecutor or by his incom­ <lb/>
            petency to manage the case escaped condemnation, this does <lb/>
            not prevent its being illegal. Were not the judges then <lb/>
            true to their oaths ? Yes How so ? I will explain. They <lb/>
            are sworn to decide according to the best of their judg­ <lb/>
            ment ; but their judicial opinion is formed from what they <lb/>
            hear; therefore, when they give their verdict according to <lb/>
            this, they act conscientiously. Every one has a clear con­ <lb/>
            science, who has not voted contrary to his opinion <lb/>
            either from enmity or favour or any other unrighteous <lb/>
            cause. If, having an instructor, he was left in ignorance of <lb/>
            any point, he ought not to be punished for his misunder­ <lb/>
            standing : it is the person who, knowing the truth, has <lb/>
            betrayed the judges or leads them astray, that is liable to <lb/>
            the curse. Therefore in every assembly the crier pronounces <lb/>
            a curse, not upon those who are misled, but upon those <lb/>
            who speak to mislead either the Council or the People or <lb/>
            the Jury. Don't let it be told you then, that such decrees <lb/>
            have been passed; let it be shown that they are lawful. <lb/>
            Don't let them plead that other men have pronounced former <lb/>
            decrees to be valid; but require them to satisfy you, that <lb/>
            their arguments upon this decree are juster than ours. If <lb/>
            they are unable to do so, it is not right for you, I think, to <lb/>
            let the delusion of others prevail over your own understand­ <lb/>
            ing. Besides, as it appears to me, it is sheer impudence to <lb/>
            argue in such a way, that similar decrees have been passed <lb/>
            by others before. It is not because the laws have been <lb/>
            at some former time transgressed, and you have followed the <lb/>
            precedent, that you ought to be acquitted : on the contrary, <lb/>
            you should be convicted all the more on that account. For <lb/>
            as, if. any of the former parties had been condemned, you <lb/>
             <pb n="200"/>
            would not have framed this motion, so, if you are convicted <lb/>
            now, no one will frame such again.1</p>
          <p>That Aristocrates has drawn his decree plainly in defiance <lb/>
            of all the laws, he will not be able, I think, to deny : but I <lb/>
            have seen a man before now, 0 Athenians, who upon his <lb/>
            trial for an illegal measure, when he was convicted by the <lb/>
            laws, urged and insisted strongly that what he had proposed <lb/>
            was for your advantage: a foolish, or rather an impudent <lb/>
            line of argument, I take it; for, even if his points are good <lb/>
            in all other respects, inasmuch as you are sworn to decide <lb/>
            according to the laws, and he asks you to confirm a decree <lb/>
            which he himself cannot show to be rightfully drawn, it can <lb/>
            hardly be for your good, since you ought to set the highest <lb/>
            value upon the observance of your oaths: at the same time <lb/>
            this impudence has a sort of reasonableness about it. To <lb/>
            the defendant however even this line of argument will not <lb/>
            be open : for the decree, entirely opposed as it is to the laws, <lb/>
            is more injurious than illegal. And this also I will prove to <lb/>
            you immediately. That I may make my meaning clear in <lb/>
            the fewest possible words, I will mention an example familiar <lb/>
            to you all.</p>
          <p>You know it is good for the commonwealth, that neither <lb/>
            the Thebans nor the Lacedæmonians should be powerful; <lb/>
            but that the one should have the Phocians for a. counter­ <lb/>
            poise, the other some other people ; for by such a state of <lb/>
            things your safety and preeminence are established. Be <lb/>
            sure then, it is equally advantageous for your countrymen of <lb/>
            Chersonesus, that none of the Thracians should be powerful: <lb/>
            for their mutual quarrels and jealousies are the best and <lb/>
            firmest of all safeguards for the Chersonese. This decree <lb/>
            however, by giving security to the chief minister of Cer­ <lb/>
            sobleptes, and putting the generals of the other princes in <lb/>
            fear and dread of being accused, renders the latter powerless, <lb/>
            and the former (a single monarch) strong.</p>
          <p>That you may not be greatly surprised at your decrees <note type="footnote"> 1 See ante, p. 141. To the passages there cited may be added the <lb/>
            speech of Angelo in Measure for Measure, Act II. Scene 2 :— <lb/>
            The law hath not been dead, tho' it hath slept: <lb/>
            How many had not dared to do that evil, <lb/>
            If the first man that did th' edict infringe <lb/>
            Had answer'd for the deed. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="201"/>
            having so important an effect, I will remind you of a circum­ <lb/>
            stance which you are all acquainted with. When Miltocythes <lb/>
            revolted from Cotys, (the war had then lasted for some time, <lb/>
            Ergophilus had been removed, and Autocles was about to <lb/>
            sail from Athens as commander,) a certain decree was framed <lb/>
            here, under the terror of which Miltocythes, thinking that <lb/>
            you were not on his side, withdrew,1 and Cotys got possession <lb/>
            of the Sacred Mountain and the treasures. Afterwards, men <lb/>
            of Athens, Autocles was brought to trial for having caused <lb/>
            the ruin of Miltocythes; the time for an indictment against <lb/>

          <p>Be assured then that now, unless you repeal this decree, it <lb/>
            will marvellously discourage both the princes and their <lb/>
            generals: for they will imagine that they are wholly dis­ <lb/>
            regarded, and that you are turning round to Cersobleptes. <lb/>
            If in consequence of such belief they should yield up their <lb/>
            kingdom when Cersobleptes takes an opportunity of attacking <lb/>
            them, see again what will happen. Let me suppose that <lb/>
            Cersobleptes commits hostilities against us, which he is more <lb/>
            likely to do than otherwise if he has the means,2 shall we not <lb/>

            him ? Suppose then they should say to us—“ You, Athenians, <lb/>

            made it wofully perilous for us to defend ourselves, by <lb/>

            selves and for us.”—Tell me; if they should say this, will not <lb/>
            their language be juster than ours ? I imagine so.</p>
          <p>Nor can you allege, that it was very natural you should be <lb/>
            tricked and deluded. For if you had nothing else to guide <lb/>
            your calculations, and were unable of yourselves to compre­ <lb/>
            hend the questions, you had an example before your eyes in <lb/>
            these Olynthians, for whom what has Philip done and how <lb/>
            do they treat him ? He did not restore Potidæa to them at <lb/>
            a time when he was no longer able to withhold it, as Cer­ <lb/>
            sobleptes restored the Chersonese to you; but after he had <lb/>
            expended large sums in the war with you, when he had <lb/>
            taken and might have held it himself, he delivered it up, and <lb/>
            never attempted to do anything else. Yet they-as long as. <lb/>
            his power appeared compatible with their trusting him, so <lb/>
            long did they remain his allies and fight with us on his <lb/>
            account: now that they have seen him grow too mighty to be <lb/>
            trusted, so far from voting that, whoever kills any of the <lb/>
            persons who have helped to establish his empire may be <lb/>
            arrested in the dominions of their allies, they have made <lb/>
            friends of you, who they know would most gladly kill both <lb/>
            Philip's friends and Philip himself, and they promise to make <lb/>
            you their allies also. Then are Olynthians able to foresee <lb/>
            the future, and will you who are Athenians not do the same ? <lb/>
            It would be disgraceful for a people who are distinguished <lb/>
            above others for their political wisdom to display less <lb/>
            acquaintance with their own interests than the Olynthians.</p>
          <p>I hear also that he will say something of the same kind <lb/>
            that Aristomachus said formerly in his address to you; that <lb/>
            it is impossible Cersobleptes will ever choose to be your enemy <lb/>
            by attempting to deprive you of Chersonesus; for, even if he <lb/>
            could take and hold it, it would be of no advantage to him. The <lb/>
            revenue from Chersonesus is not above thirty talents, when <lb/>
            it is not at war; if at war, the revenue is nothing; while <lb/>
            from the seaports, which would then be closed, the revenue <lb/>
            is more than three hundred talents : they wonder therefore <lb/>
            (so they will put it), what he could mean by choosing to get <lb/>
            small profits and be at war, when he might get larger profits <lb/>
            and be your friend.</p>
          <p>I could assign many reasons which should induce us to be <lb/>
            mistrustful, as I conceive, rather than to put confidence in <lb/>
            these men and suffer Cersobleptes to become great: however I <lb/>
             <pb n="203"/>
            will mention that which most readily occurs to me. I <lb/>
            needn't ask, men of Athens, if you know Philip of Macedon. <lb/>
            It was surely much more to his advantage to receive the <lb/>
            revenues of all Macedonia in peace, than to receive those of <lb/>
            Amphipolis with peril, and more desirable for him to be con­ <lb/>
            nected with you his hereditary allies, than with the Thessa­ <lb/>
            lians who formerly expelled his father. Independently of <lb/>
            this, it is notorious that you, Athenians, never betrayed any <lb/>
            of your friends, while the Thessalians have betrayed all <lb/>
            theirs. And yet, even under these circumstances, you see <lb/>
            that he has chosen to get small profits and have treacherous <lb/>
            friends and incur danger, in preference to living in security. <lb/>
            What can be the cause ?—Certainly there is no very obvious <lb/>
            way of accounting for it. The reason is this, men of Athens. <lb/>
            There are two advantages for all men, one, the chief and <lb/>
            greatest of all, prosperity, the other, inferior to that but <lb/>
            greater than all besides, prudence ; but men do not get both <lb/>
            together, and no prosperous person puts any bound or limit <lb/>
            to his cupidity ; therefore many, by aiming at greater things, <lb/>
            lose often what they have already.</p>
          <p>And what need to mention Philip or any one else ? The <lb/>
            father even of Cersobleptes, Cotys, whenever he was engaged <lb/>
            in quarrels, sent ambassadors and was ready to do anything, <lb/>
            and perceived then how contrary it was to his interest to go <lb/>
            to war with Athens : but as soon as he was master of Thrace, <lb/>
            then would he attack cities and encroach upon us, then <lb/>
            would he vent his drunken fury upon himself first and us <lb/>
            next, then was he for conquering the whole country, the <lb/>
            thing was inexplicable. For those who commence unjust <lb/>
            undertakings with views of ambition do not usually take <lb/>
            into account the difficulties, but only the results of success. <lb/>
            Therefore I would have your measures so taken, that, if <lb/>
            Cersobleptes determines to act properly by you, he will suffer <lb/>
            no wrong at your hands, but, if he foolishly attacks you, he <lb/>
            may not be beyond the reach of punishment.</p>
          <p>I will read you the letter which Cotys sent when Milto­ <lb/>
            cythes had revolted, and that which he sent after getting <lb/>
            mastery of the whole kingdom, when he wrote to Timomachus <lb/>
            and captured your fortresses.l <note type="footnote"> 1 "Hv regitur ab antegresso <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἒπεμψε</foreign>: ad <foreign xml:lang="grc">πέμψας</foreign> autem subaudias, si <lb/>

          <p>Seeing this example, men of Athens, and remembering that <lb/>
            Philip, when he besieged Amphipolis, pretended he was <lb/>
            besieging it that he might give it up to you, but, after he had <lb/>
            taken it, deprived you of Potidæa also, if you will hearken to <lb/>
            me, you will wish to have that security, which they say <lb/>
            Philocrates the son of Ephialtes proposed once to the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians. The story is that, when the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            were trying to overreach him and offered him any security <lb/>
            that he would like to take, he said that in his opinion the <lb/>
            only security was, to show how they would be disabled from <lb/>
            injuring him if they wished it; for he was certain they <lb/>
            would always wish it, and therefore there could be no <lb/>
            security, as long as they had the power. Such a security, if <lb/>
            you follow my advice, will you hold against this Thracian, <lb/>
            and not care to know what his feelings to you would be, if <lb/>
            he got the monarchy of all Thrace.</p>
          <p>That it is altogether an act of insanity to frame such <lb/>
            decrees and grant such honours, may be easily seen by many <lb/>
            examples. Of course, men of Athens, you all know as well <lb/>
            as I do, that formerly you created Cotys a citizen, evidently <lb/>
            at that time thinking him friendly and well disposed to you. <lb/>
            Nay, you even honoured him with golden crowns, which you <lb/>
            would never have done had you thought him an enemy. <lb/>
            Nevertheless, when he showed himself to be an impious <lb/>
            reprobate and loaded you with injuries, you made his <lb/>
            murderers, Python and Heraclides of Ænos, citizens of <lb/>
            Athens, and bestowed golden crowns upon them, as bene­ <lb/>
            factors. Suppose now, at the time when Cotys was thought <lb/>
            to be so attached to you, any one had moved, that whoever <lb/>
            killed Cotys must be given up for punishment, would you <lb/>
            have given up Python and his brother, or would you in spite <lb/>
            of that decree have made them citizens and rewarded them <lb/>
            as benefactors ? Again-take the case of Alexander of <lb/>
            Thessaly. When he kept Pelopidas in prison and bonds, <lb/>
            and was the bitterest enemy of the Thebans, and on such <note type="footnote"> epistolam scripsisse ad Senatum Populumque Atheniensium; postea, <lb/>

            and you sent assistance to him, and Alexander was every­ <lb/>

            killed Alexander should be liable to arrest, would it have <lb/>
            been safe for any one to attempt to punish him for the <lb/>
            affronts and insults which he afterwards heaped upon us ? <lb/>
            And why need one mention other cases ? Look at Philip, <lb/>
            who is now considered to be our greatest enemy. If, <lb/>
            when he released some of our countrymen whom he had <lb/>
            taken prisoners in the attempt to restore Argæus, and <lb/>
            returned to them all that they had lost, and sent a letter <lb/>
            declaring that he was ready to make alliance and to renew <lb/>
            his hereditary friendship with us, if at that time he had asked <lb/>
            to obtain such an honour, and any of the persons released by <lb/>
            him had proposed, that whoever killed Philip should be <lb/>
            liable to arrest, a pretty mockery of us it would have been ! <lb/>
            Surely you see and understand, 0 Athenians, what folly you <lb/>
            would have been chargeable with in each of these cases, had <lb/>
            you happened to have passed any such decree. No men in <lb/>
            their senses, I take it, will either so trust a person whom <lb/>
            they consider their friend, as to deprive themselves of <lb/>
            defence against his attacks, or so hate one whom they deem <lb/>
            an enemy, that, if he changes and wishes to be their friend, <lb/>
            they prevent the possibility of his doing so. They should <lb/>
            carry both their friendship and their hatred, I take it, so far <lb/>
            only as not to exceed moderation in either.1 <note type="footnote"> 1 I have more than once had occasion to notice coincidences of <lb/>

          <p>I consider, 0 Athenians, that all persons who desire to <lb/>
            become citizens out of love for our customs and our laws, on <lb/>
            being admitted to these, would at the same time settle <lb/>
            among us and partake the benefits which they coveted. <lb/>
            Those who have no love or admiration for your institutions, <lb/>
            but regard only the advantage which they get by appearing <lb/>
            to be honoured by you, they, I expect, or rather I am quite <lb/>
            certain, whenever they spy a hope of greater advantage else­ <lb/>
            where, will run after that without troubling themselves in <lb/>
            the least about you. For example-that you may see to <lb/>
            what I allude-this Python, when he had just killed Cotys, <lb/>
            and did not think it safe to go to every place, came to you <lb/>
            and requested you to make him a citizen, and preferred you <lb/>
             <pb n="208"/>
            to all the world : but now that he thinks Philip's connexion <lb/>
            suits him better, he cares not an atom for you but attaches <lb/>
            himself to him. For with those who live for ambitious objects <lb/>
            there is nothing, men of Athens, there is nothing. stable or <lb/>
            honest: you must get the better of them, if you are wise, by <lb/>
            taking precaution, not trust them first and accuse them <lb/>
            afterwards. Could we assume therefore, 0 Athenians, con­ <lb/>
            trary to the fact, that Charidemus himself has been and is <lb/>
            and will be true to our interests, and will never alter his <lb/>
            views, you ought not to vote him these privileges any the <lb/>
            more. If indeed he were getting the protection of the decree <lb/>
            for any other purpose than to aid Cersobleptes, it would not <lb/>
            have been so bad: but I find upon calculation, that the <lb/>
            person for whom he will use the advantage given by the <lb/>
            decree is not worthy to be trusted either by us or by him. <lb/>
            Mark how just are my reasonings upon every point, and how <lb/>
            well grounded my apprehensions.</p>
          <p>I look at Cotys; I see that he was connected by marriage <lb/>
            with Iphicrates in the same way that Cersobleptes is with <lb/>
            Charidemus, and that the services rendered by Iphicrates to <lb/>
            Cotys were much more important and meritorious than those <lb/>
            rendered by Charidemus to Cersobleptes. Let us look at the. <lb/>
            matter thus -Of course, 0 Athenians, you are aware that, <lb/>
            although Iphicrates had a brazen statue here and main­ <lb/>
            tenance in the city-hall and other honours and rewards, which <lb/>
            made his lot a happy one, he dared to fight in defence of <lb/>
            Cotys against your commanders at sea, and set a higher value <lb/>
            on that monarch's safety than on the honours which he him­ <lb/>
            self enjoyed among you: and, had not your resentment been <lb/>
            more moderate than his indiscretion, nothing could have <lb/>
            prevented his being the most wretched of men. And yet <lb/>
            Cotys, after having been saved by him and received real proof <lb/>
            of his attachment, when he thought himself completely secure, <lb/>
            never studied to requite him, never employed him to do you <lb/>
            any kindness that he might obtain forgiveness for the past, <lb/>
            but on the contrary, required his assistance in besieging the <lb/>
            rest of your fortresses, and upon his refusal, taking with him <lb/>
            his own barbaric force together with that which Iphicrates <lb/>
            had collected, and hiring also the services of this Charidemus, <lb/>
            attacked your fortresses, and reduced Iphicrates to such <lb/>
            straits, that he went and lived at Antissa and afterwards at <lb/>
             <pb n="209"/>
            Drys, considering that he could not with any decency come <lb/>
            to you, of whom he had made less account than of a Thracian <lb/>
            and a barbarian, and that it was not safe to remain with <lb/>
            Cotys, who he saw was so indifferent to his welfare.1</p>
          <p>Just so, men of Athens, should Cersobleptes, exalted <lb/>
            through the indemnity which they are now procuring for <lb/>
            Charidemus, be indifferent to his interest, and form plots and <lb/>
            designs against you, are you content, provided Charidemus <lb/>
            be tricked, to have armed the Thracian with power against <lb/>
            yourselves ? I can hardly think so. The proper course I <lb/>
            take to be this. If Charidemus feels and foresees the <lb/>
            danger, and still exerts himself to obtain such a decree, you <lb/>
            ought to oppose him as an insidious enemy; if it has escaped <lb/>
            his notice, the more we believe in his good intentions, the <lb/>
            more should we provide both for our own security and for <lb/>
            his. For it is the duty of true friends not to oblige their <lb/>
            well-wishers by doing what will be hurtful both to them and <lb/>
            to themselves, but to help them in what is likely to be for <lb/>
            their common advantage ; and where a man sees farther than <lb/>
            his friend, he should manage things for the best, and not <lb/>
            treat the gratification of the moment as of higher importance <lb/>
            than all future time.</p>
          <p>Nor upon reflexion am I able to see, that, perfidious and <lb/>
            I barbarous as Cersobleptes. is, he would still be cautious not <lb/>
            to wrong Charidemus so grievously. For when again I con­ <lb/>
            sider, of what advantages Cotys had no scruple to despoil <lb/>
            Iphicrates, I think this man would not have the slightest care <lb/>
            for what Charidemus would lose. Cotys expected to deprive <lb/>
            Iphicrates of honours, maintenance, statues, a country which <lb/>
            made him enviable, everything (I may almost say) which <lb/>
            rendered life worth having; and yet he had no remorse : but <lb/>
            really of what should this man be anxious not to deprive <lb/>
            Charidemus? He possesses nothing whatever at Athens, <lb/>
            neither children, nor statue, nor relations, nor anything <lb/>
            else. If Cersobleptes however is not trustworthy by nature, <lb/>
            if his past conduct makes it dangerous to trust him, and if <lb/>
            there is nothing in the circumstances which should induce <lb/>
            him against his nature and against all expectation to protect <note type="footnote"> 1 As to the connexion of Iphicrates with Cotys, his residence in <lb/>
            Thrace, &amp;c., see Vol. L Appendix III. p. 267; Grote's History of Greece, <lb/>

            the interests of Charidemus, why should we, like pure and <lb/>
            downright simpletons, assist him in the accomplishment of his <lb/>
            objects, especially when they are injurious to us? I cannot <lb/>
            understand.</p>
          <p>But besides that the decree is impolitic, I must inform you <lb/>
            that it is not for the honour of Athens, that she should be <lb/>
            known to have decreed such a thing. If the decree, 0 <lb/>
            Athenians, had been for the benefit of a man residing in a <lb/>
            city and living under constitutional government, bad as it is, <lb/>
            it would have been less disgraceful: but it has been drawn <lb/>
            in favour of Charidemus, who resides in no city at all, but is <lb/>
            the general of a Thracian and a prince, whose royal authority <lb/>
            he uses to commit acts of injustice. Of course you know, <lb/>
            that all these mercenary leaders seize upon Greek cities and <lb/>
            endeavour to establish their own dominion : if the truth is <lb/>
            to be spoken, they go about everywhere the common enemies <lb/>
            of all who wish to live as freemen under the laws of their <lb/>
            country. Is it becoming then or honourable in you, 0 <lb/>
            Athenians, to have passed this vote before all the world, <lb/>
            giving protection to a man who will plot against the first <lb/>
            people he meets for his own selfish purposes, and to have <lb/>
            proclaimed that those who defend their own liberties shall be <lb/>
            excluded from your alliance ? I do not conceive that it is <lb/>
            either honourable or worthy of you. Can it be otherwise <lb/>
            than disgraceful, when you reproach the Lacedæmonians for <lb/>
            making those terms which put the Asiatic Greeks under the <lb/>
            power of the king, that you should yourselves surrender to <lb/>
            Cersobleptes the Europeans and all whom Charidemus thinks <lb/>
            he can master ? For this decree does nothing less, when it <lb/>
            is not defined what his general may do or may not do, but <lb/>
            all who defend themselves are threatened with such fearful <lb/>
            consequences.</p>
          <p>Again, 0 Athenians, I would remind you of an actual <lb/>
            occurrence, by which you will still more clearly see how <lb/>
            absolutely necessary it is to rescind this decree. On a certain <lb/>
            occasion once you made Ariobarzanes a citizen, and Philiscus1 <note type="footnote"> 1 Philiscus was a native of Abydus, who became one of the chief <lb/>
            officers of Ariobarzanes, satrap of Phrygia, and was employed by him <lb/>
            in important commands on the coast of the Hellespont. He was sent <lb/>
            in the year B. c. 368 on a mission to Greece, to mediate for a peace <lb/>
            between the contending states. A congress was held for that purpose </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="211"/>
            also on his account, just as now you have made Charidemus <lb/>
            on account of Cersobleptes. Philiscus, resembling this man <lb/>
            in his principles of action, got possession of Greek cities by <lb/>
            the power of Ariobarzanes, took up his quarters in them and <lb/>
            committed divers atrocities, outraging free women and <lb/>
            children, and doing all that a man brought up in ignorance <lb/>
            of laws and civil government would do, if armed with <lb/>
            authority.1 Well : in Lampsacus there are found two men ; <lb/>
            (one was named Thersagoras, and the other Execestus;) <lb/>
            who, holding the same sentiments as our own people about <lb/>
            tyrants, kill Philiscus, as they were right to do, under a sense <lb/>
            of their obligation to free their country. Suppose any of <lb/>
            the orators, who supported Philiscus at the time when he <lb/>
            was giving pay to the mercenaries in Perinthus, when he was <lb/>
            master of all the Hellespont and the most powerful of the <lb/>
            lieutenants, had proposed as Aristocrates has now, that <lb/>
            whoever killed Philiscus might lawfully be apprehended in <lb/>
            the territory of our allies ; see, by heavens, into what disgrace <lb/>
            our commonwealth would have fallen ! Thersagoras and <lb/>
            Execestus came to Lesbos and resided there : had any of the <note type="footnote"> at Delphi, but failed in its purpose, the Spartans insisting upon the <lb/>
            restoration of Messenia, which the Thebans would not consent to. <lb/>
            Philiscus, having brought with him a large sum of money, collected <lb/>
            a body of mercenaries to assist the Spartans. It may have been about <lb/>
            this time that he and his master were created citizens of Athens. <lb/>
            A few years afterwards Ariobarzanes, meditating revolt from the king <lb/>
            of Persia, solicited aid from the Athenians, and Timotheus was sent to <lb/>
            the Hellespont, but with limited powers, under that decree which is <lb/>
            mentioned in the Oration on the Liberty of the Rhodians. (Vol. I. p. 193.) <lb/>
            .The satrap then rendered important services to Athens, by helping <lb/>
            Timotheus to take Sestus and Crithote. (See Xenophon, Hellen. vii. <lb/>
            c. 1. s. 27 ; Diodorus, xv. 70 ; Cornelius Nepos, Vit. Timoth.) </note><note type="footnote"> 1 The incapacity of men brought up like Charidemus and Philiscus <lb/>

            friends or children of Philiscus laid bands upon either of <lb/>
            them, he must have been given up by virtue of your decree. <lb/>
            Would not your conduct have been shameful and dreadful, <lb/>
            O Athenians, if, while you set up in brass and reward with <lb/>
            the highest honours those who have performed such a feat <lb/>
            at Athens, you had proscribed as outlaws men of other coun­ <lb/>
            tries who showed the same devotion to their fatherland ? <lb/>
            Happily in the case of Philiscus you were not thus imposed <lb/>
            upon, and did not incur the shame : in this case, if you <lb/>
            take my advice, you will guard against it. For when <lb/>
            nothing is defined, but the clause is simply "if any one <lb/>
            shall kill Charidemus," very possibly something of this kind <lb/>
            might occur.</p>
          <p>I would now briefly examine the conduct of Charidemus, <lb/>
            and expose the outrageous impudence of his panegyrists. <lb/>
            One thing I promise you—and let no man be offended at the <lb/>
            promise—I will show not merely that he is unworthy of the <lb/>
            protection which Aristocrates has given him, but that he <lb/>
            deserves the severest chastisement, if men do deserve to be <lb/>
            punished who have evil intentions, who impose upon you, <lb/>
            who invariably take part against you. Some of you perhaps, <lb/>
            considering that the man has been made a citizen and after­ <lb/>
            wards honoured with golden crowns as a benefactor, wonder <lb/>
            how such gross deception could have been practised upon you <lb/>
            so easily. Be assured, men of Athens, it has been practised : <lb/>
            how you have not unnaturally fallen into the error, I will <lb/>
            explain to you. The reason is that, while you, men of <lb/>
            Athens, judge rightly of many things, you do not use your <lb/>
            judgment consistently. For instance, what do I mean ? If <lb/>
            you were asked, which of all classes in the state you regard <lb/>
            as the vilest, you would not say the agriculturists, nor the <lb/>
            merchants, nor the mining people, nor any of that kind ; <lb/>
            but if any one said, the persons who are accustomed to <lb/>
            make speeches and motions for hire, I am sure it would <lb/>
            meet with your assent. Up to this point therefore you judge <lb/>
            well; not so rightly in what follows: for on those, whom <lb/>
            you think the most worthless of men, you depend for a <lb/>
            correct estimate of every one's character; and they tell you <lb/>
            that a man is good or bad, whom it suits their purpose to <lb/>
            call such, not whom it is right and proper : which is exactly <lb/>
            what the orators have done all along with this Charidemus, <lb/>
             <pb n="213"/>
            as you will agree with me, when you have heard my account <lb/>
            of his actions.</p>
          <p>The campaigns which he has served against Athens <lb/>
            originally as a slinger and light-armed soldier I do not set <lb/>
            down as an offence, nor the fact that he once kept a pirate <lb/>
            vessel and plundered your allies. I pass by all this. Why ? <lb/>
            Because, men of Athens, the pressure of necessity destroys <lb/>
            all calculations about right and- wrong, so that a man who <lb/>
            judges fairly must not take a nice account of such things.1 <lb/>
            But let me explain how he began to do you injury when he <lb/>
            was a mercenary leader and at the head of some troops. <lb/>
            First of all, he was hired by Iphicrates, and served under <lb/>
            him for more than three years. When you deposed Iphicrates <lb/>
            from his command, and sent out Timotheus to conduct the <lb/>
            war against Amphipolis and Chersonesus, those Amphipolitan <lb/>
            hostages whom Iphicrates had received from Harpalus and <lb/>
            entrusted to his charge, although you passed a resolution <lb/>
            requiring him to bring them to Athens, he delivered up <lb/>
            to the Amphipolitans ; and that prevented your taking <lb/>
            Amphipolis. When Timotheus offered again to hire him <lb/>
            and his troops, he declines the engagement with him, but <lb/>
            sailed away with your pinnaces to Cotys, whom he knew <lb/>
            for certain to be your greatest enemy. Afterwards, when <lb/>
            Timotheus resolved to commence the war against Amphipolis <lb/>
            before that against Chersonesus, and he bad no opportunity <lb/>
            of doing you any mischief there, he hires himself again to <lb/>
            the Olynthians your enemies, and to those who held Amphi­ <lb/>
            polis at that time. On his passage thither, having set sail <lb/>
            from Cardia to fight against us, he was taken by our galleys : <lb/>
            but on account of the emergency and our wanting soldiers for <lb/>
            the war against Amphipolis, instead of his being punished for <lb/>
            not having given up the hostages and for deserting and carrying <lb/>
            the vessels to Cotys your enemy, he exchanged pledges and <note type="footnote"> 1 So Shakspeare, in Measure for Measure, Act II. Scene 4: <lb/>

            should have been grateful to you for, not having been put to <lb/>
            death as he deserved, the commonwealth, as if she were <lb/>

          <p>That he first engaged to serve in a country where he <lb/>
            expected to fight against you, though he might have accepted <lb/>
            engagements in many other places; that afterwards, when <lb/>
            he could do you no mischief there, he started again for a <lb/>
            place where he was to act against Athens ; and that he is <lb/>
            the principal cause of our not taking Amphipolis ; you have <lb/>
            heard from the letter and the decree and the deposition. <lb/>
            Such are the first acts of Charidemus. Now look at others.</p>
          <p>After the lapse of some time, when the war had com­ <lb/>
            menced with Cotys, he sends a letter to you, or rather not <lb/>
            to you but to Cephisodotus; (so persuaded was he from <lb/>
            a consciousness of what he had done, that he himself could <lb/>
            not even deceive the commonwealth,) in which he promised <lb/>
            to recover Chersonesus for the commonwealth, although he bad <lb/>
            determined to do just the reverse. You must hear the particu­ <lb/>
            lars of the letter, (they are not long,) and mark the style in <lb/>
            which the man has treated you from the beginning. When <lb/>
            he quitted the service of Timotheus at the time I mention, <lb/>
            retiring from Amphipolis, he crossed over to Asia, and, as <lb/>
            Artabazus had then been arrested by Autophradates, he hires <lb/>
            himself and his troops to the sons-in-law of Artabazus. <lb/>
            Though he had given and taken pledges, he scrupled not to <lb/>
            violate his oath, and the people of the country being off their <lb/>
            guard, supposing him to be a friend, he seizes upon three of <lb/>
            their towns, Scepsis, Cebren, and Ilium. Having got posses­ <lb/>
            sion of those places, he suffered a misfortune which, I will not <lb/>
            say a man pretending to be a general, but any ordinary <lb/>
            person would have known better than to do. For though he <lb/>
            had not a single place upon the coast, or from which it was <lb/>
             <pb n="215"/>
            possible to get provisions for his troops, and he had no pro­ <lb/>
            vision in those places, he stayed within their walls, instead of <lb/>
            pillaging them and making off when once he had resolved <lb/>
            upon foul play.1 Artabazus however, having been released <lb/>
            by Autophradates, collected forces and advanced : he had <lb/>
            supplies at hand from upper Phrygia and Lydia and Paph­ <lb/>
            lagonia, which were friendly to him, while for Charidemus <lb/>
            there was nothing left but a blockade. Perceiving what a <lb/>
            scrape he was in, and reckoning that he would be taken <lb/>
            prisoner by famine at least, if by nothing else, he saw either <lb/>
            by the help of some monitor or of his own reflexion, that his <lb/>
            only chance of safety was that which saves all people. What <lb/>
            is that? Your-shall I call it humanity, 0 Athenians, or <lb/>
            any other name ? Having come to this opinion, he sends you <lb/>
            the letter which it is worth your while to hear, hoping that <lb/>
            by means of his promise to recover Chersonesus for you, and <lb/>
            by Cephisodotus appearing to wish this out of enmity to <lb/>
            Iphicrates and Cotys, he might obtain ships from you and <lb/>
            make his escape out of Asia. But in the very playing of <lb/>
            the trick there occurred something which exposed it palpably. <lb/>
            What was this ? Memnon and Mentor, the sons-in-law of <lb/>
            Artabazus, who were young men and had got an unexpected <lb/>
            piece of good fortune in the connexion of Artabazus, wishing <lb/>
            to govern the country in peace immediately, and to enjoy <lb/>
            their honours without war and danger, persuade Artabazus <lb/>
            to abandon his design of punishing Charidemus and to send <lb/>
            him off under a convention, representing that you would <lb/>
            bring Charidemus across whether he liked or no, and he <lb/>
            would not be able to prevent it. Charidemus, obtaining <lb/>
            this extraordinary and unlooked-for deliverance, crossed over <lb/>
            to the Chersonese by himself through the convention; but, <note type="footnote"> 1 Auger expresses it neatly enough: " comme il auroit dû ayant <lb/>
            résolu de mal faire." "<foreign xml:lang="grc">Εγνω ἀδικει̃ν</foreign> is used as <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐγνωκὼς ποιει̃ν</foreign> just above. <lb/>
            It is capable indeed of bearing the sense which Pabst gives it: "he <lb/>
            knew that he had done wrong." My way of taking it is favoured by <lb/>
            the position of the words, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀδικει̃ν</foreign> coming before <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἒγνω</foreign>, and best suits <lb/>
            the reasoning of the orator. To plunder and be off was the most <lb/>
            prudent course for Charidemus, the moment he determined to act <lb/>
            treacherously. </note><note type="footnote"> Pabst translates with some degree of circumlocution : ohne nach <lb/>

            so far from attacking Cotys, though he had written to say <lb/>
            that Cotys would not resist his attack, or from helping you <lb/>
            to recover the Chersonese, he again hired himself to Cotys <lb/>
            and laid siege to your remaining fortresses, Crithote and <lb/>
            Elaeus.</p>
          <p>That, even while he was yet in Asia and was writing the <lb/>
            letter to you, he had resolved upon this course and played <lb/>
            you false, you will see by the circumstances of his passage: <lb/>
            for he started from Abydus, which has all along been your <lb/>
            enemy, and from which the capturers of Sestus made their <lb/>
            expedition, and he crossed over to Sestus, which was held <lb/>
            by Cotys. Don't suppose that either the Abydenes or the <lb/>
            Sestians would receive him after that letter had been sent to <lb/>
            you, if they had not been privy to his deceit, and had not <lb/>
            themselves joined in the fraud, desiring that you should <lb/>
            provide security for the passage of the troops, but that, after <lb/>
            they passed, (which they did with the permission of Arta­ <lb/>
            bazus,) the advantage should be their own.</p>
          <p>To prove these statements, read the letters, that which he <lb/>
            sent, and those from the governors in Chersonesus. You will <lb/>

            from Abydus to Sestus. Think ye the Abydenes or the <lb/>
            Sestians would have received him, had they not been parties <lb/>
            to the deception when he sent the letter to you ?</p>

            extravagant terms in which he has praised himself to you, <lb/>

          <p>Fine words, are they not, 0 Athenians ? and deserving of <lb/>
            your best thanks, if they were true. But no. When he did <lb/>

          <p>Just so: since the passage of Charidemus who promised to <lb/>

          <p>You see; it is testified on all hands, that, after he crossed <lb/>
            the straits, he marched not against Cotys, but with him <lb/>
            against us. Read me this one more letter, and put the others <lb/>

          <p>Stop. Observe that, after having written that he would <lb/>
            restore the Chersonese, he hired himself to your enemies and <lb/>
            attempted to deprive you of what was left : after writing that <lb/>
            Alexander had sent envoys to him and he refused to admit <lb/>
            them, he is shown to be cooperating with pirates in his <lb/>
            commission. A pure well-wisher of yours, is he not ? and a <lb/>
            man who would never write an untruth or deceive !</p>
          <p>Plain as it is from this evidence, that no faith can be put in <lb/>
            his professions and affectation of friendship for Athens, it is <lb/>
            not yet so plain but what the subsequent events will make <lb/>
            it clearer still. Cotys fortunately (being your enemy and a <lb/>
            bad man) is killed by Python : Cersobleptes, the present <lb/>
            king, was a stripling, as were all the sons of Cotys, and <lb/>
            Charidemus, by being on the spot and having a force, was <lb/>
            master of everything: Cephisodotus had arrived with <lb/>
            command, (the person to whom he himself had sent that <lb/>
            letter,) and the galleys which, while his escape was yet <lb/>
            doubtful, and in the event of Artabazus opposing, were to <lb/>
            save him. What now, 0 Athenians, should a man truly <lb/>
            sincere and friendly have done, when a general was on the <lb/>
            spot, not one of those having (as he might have said) an ill­ <lb/>
            feeling towards him, but one whom he had chosen out of all <lb/>
            your generals to be his own friend, and to whom he had sent <lb/>
            the letter, and when Cotys was dead, and he had all the <lb/>
            power in his hands? Should he not have restored the <lb/>
            territory to you immediately, and joined with you in estab­ <lb/>
            lishing the king of Thrace upon his throne, and given proof <lb/>
            of his attachment to you, when he had got such an oppor­ <lb/>
            tunity ? I should say so. Was anything of the kind done <lb/>
            by him? Very far from it. He continued to make war <lb/>
            upon you for altogether seven months, acting openly as an <lb/>
             <pb n="218"/>
            enemy and not allowing even a civil word. And when we <lb/>
            anchored at first with only ten ships. in the harbour of <lb/>
            Perinthus, having heard that he was in the neighbourhood, <lb/>
            in order that we might be in communication with him and <lb/>
            confer upon matters, he watched the time when our men <lb/>
            were at dinner, and made an attempt to capture our vessels; <lb/>
            many of the, seamen he killed, and drove the whole body into <lb/>
            the sea, having with him some cavalry and light troops. <lb/>
            Afterwards, when we sailed, not to attack any fort or <lb/>
            district in Thrace—for this cannot be said—" True, he did <lb/>
            some damage, but it was in self-defence"—Nothing of the <lb/>
            kind: we went to no part of Thrace, but against Alope­ <lb/>
            connesus, which is in the Chersonese and belonged to you; <lb/>
            it is a promontory jutting out towards Imbrus at a great <lb/>
            distance from Thrace, and was full of pirates and corsairs. <lb/>
            When we had come there, I say, and were besieging those <lb/>
            people, he marched right through the Chersonese, your <lb/>
            territory, made an attack upon us, and assisted the pi­ <lb/>
            rates. And sitting down before the place, he persuaded and <lb/>
            forced your commander into measures adverse to your <lb/>
            interests, instead of being himself persuaded by him to do <lb/>
            aught that he had undertaken and promised; and so he <lb/>
            draws up that convention with Cephisodotus, at which you <lb/>
            were so angry and indignant, that you deposed the com­ <lb/>
            mander and fined him five talents, three votes only saving <lb/>
            him from a capital sentence. But what an absurdity must <lb/>
            it be thought, 0 Athenians, when for the same actions we <lb/>
            see one man so severely punished as a culprit, and another <lb/>
            even to this moment honoured as a benefactor ?</p>
          <p>For proof of these statements-as to what happened to <lb/>
            the general, I apprehend that you are my witnesses; for you <lb/>
            tried and deposed and manifested your wrath against him, <lb/>
            and you are acquainted with all the circumstances: as to <lb/>
            what occurred at Perinthus and Alopeconnesus, call me the <lb/>
            captains for witnesses.</p>

            <title type="sub">[Evidence of the Captains.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>After this, when Cephisodotus was removed from the <lb/>
            command, and you considered the terms made with him to <lb/>
            be dishonourable and unjust, this worthy Charidemus gets <lb/>
            Miltocythes, who was throughout friendly to you, treache­ <lb/>
             <pb n="219"/>
            rously delivered to him by Smicythion, and, as it is not the <lb/>
            practice of the Thracians to put one another to death, knowing <lb/>
            that he would be safe if he were carried to Cersobleptes, he <lb/>
            hands him over to the Cardians your enemies. They, having. <lb/>
            got both him and his son into their bands, put out to sea in <lb/>
            a boat, out the throat of the son, and threw the father <lb/>
            into the sea after he had witnessed his son's butchery. This <lb/>
            act roused the indignation of the whole Thracian people; <lb/>
            Berisades and Amadocus entered into a coalition; Atheno­ <lb/>
            dorus, seeing the opportunity, made an alliance with them <lb/>
            and was in a condition to carry on war. Cersobleptes then <lb/>
            being alarmed, Athenodorus draws up a treaty, by which he <lb/>
            compels Cersobleptes to swear to an engagement with you <lb/>
            and the princes, that the kingdom of Thrace should be <lb/>
            divided among them in three shares, and that they should all <lb/>
            restore to you your territory. At the election of officers you <lb/>
            appointed Chabrias to the command in that war; but it <lb/>
            so happened that Athenodorus disbanded his forces, having <lb/>
            no money from you and no means to carry on the war, and <lb/>
            Chabrias sailed out with only one ship : under these circum­ <lb/>
            stances again what step does our Charidemus take ? The <lb/>
            treaty that he swore to with Athenodorus he disclaims, and <lb/>
            persuades Cersobleptes to disclaim it; then draws up another <lb/>
            with Chabrias, yet more shameful than that with Cephiso­ <lb/>
            dotus : Chabrias, having no force, was obliged, I suppose, to <lb/>
            acquiesce. But when you heard of it, after many speeches <lb/>
            had been made in the assembly and the treaty had been read, <lb/>
            you, without respecting either the high character of Chabrias <lb/>
            or any of his supporters, repudiated this new treaty also, and <lb/>
            passed a decree on the motion of Glaucon, to elect from <lb/>
            among yourselves ten ambassadors, with instructions, if <lb/>
            Cersobleptes would abide by the treaty with Athenodorus, <lb/>
            to swear him again, if not, to receive the oaths from the two <lb/>
            princes, and consult upon the best plan for making war <lb/>
            against him. Your ambassadors sailed from Athens; time <lb/>
            slipped on, and things came to such a pass at length, that, <lb/>
            while these men were delaying and refusing to do anything <lb/>
            honest or straightforward, we sent succours to Eubœa, and <lb/>
            Chares came home with the mercenaries, and was sent out <lb/>
            by you as general plenipotentiary to the Chersonese. Then <lb/>
            he draws up a new treaty with Chares, to which Athenodorus <lb/>
             <pb n="220"/>
            and the princes were, parties, and which is the best and <lb/>
            justest of all. And thus he has given actual proof against <lb/>
            himself, and shown that he watches for opportunities with us,1 <lb/>
            and is resolved to do nothing straightforward or equitable. <lb/>

            ever to grow powerful, and that too by your assistance ? If <lb/>
            you think so, you are wrong.</p>
          <p>To convince you of the truth of my statements-please to <lb/>

          <p>You see, men of Athens, you perceive his baseness and <lb/>
            treachery, how it sways up and down. First he wronged <lb/>
            Cephisodotus, then he desisted for fear of Athenodorus; again <lb/>
            he wronged Chabrias, and afterwards agreed with Chares. <lb/>
             <pb n="222"/>
            He has turned everything upside down, and done nothing in <lb/>
            an honest or straightforward way.</p>
          <p>Since that, as long as your force was in the Hellespont, he <lb/>
            has continued to flatter and amuse you: but no sooner did <lb/>
            he find the Hellespont freed from the presence of a force, <lb/>
            than he set himself to destroy and dethrone the two princes <lb/>
            and get the whole kingdom into his own power, knowing by <lb/>
            experience that, until he expels them, it is not possible for him <lb/>
            to break any part of his compact with you. To accomplish <lb/>
            this in the easiest way, he obtained a decree from you, by <lb/>
            which, if confirmed, (but for us and our indictment,) the two <lb/>
            princes would have suffered open wrong, their generals, Bianor, <lb/>
            Simon, Athenodorus, would have kept quiet for fear of <lb/>
            vexatious proceedings under the decree, and the person who <lb/>
            profited by the opportunity and got the whole kingdom into <lb/>
            his hands would have been established as your powerful <lb/>
            enemy.</p>
          <p>He has taken care all along to have as the base of his <lb/>
            operations the city of Cardia, which in all his treaties he has <lb/>
            reserved to himself, and of which at last he openly deprived <lb/>
            you. But why should men void of any dishonest intentions <lb/>
            towards us, and in all truth and sincerity resolved to be our <lb/>
            friends, have left themselves a base for warlike operations <lb/>
            against us ? Of course you know, (those who have been there <lb/>
            for certain, and others by their information,) that, Cardia <lb/>
            being situated as it is,l should Cersobleptes make all right for <lb/>
            himself with the Thracians,2 he can any day march safely <lb/>
            against the Chersonese. For the city of Cardia has the same <lb/>
            position in Chersonesus with regard to Thrace, which Chalets <lb/>
            has in Eubœa with regard to Boeotia; and any of you that <lb/>
            knows its position is aware also, for what opportunity he has <lb/>
            kept it to himself and laboured to exclude you from the <lb/>
            possession. You must not help him to such a chance against <lb/>
            yourselves, but throw every difficulty in the way, and aim at <lb/>
            preventing it: for, that he will let no opportunity pass by, <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τη̃ς Καρδιανω̃ν πόλεως ἐχούσης ὠς ἒχε</foreign>.. Pabst adopts Wolf's inter­ <lb/>

              been nothing to prevent your being now at war with the <lb/>

          <p>Looking at these things, you should act warily, not be fools <lb/>
            and respect him as a benefactor. You owe no gratitude to Cer­ <lb/>
            sobleptes for the compulsion under which he deceitfully pre­ <lb/>
            tends to be your friend, nor for the trifling sums which Chari­ <lb/>
            demus disburses privately among your generals and orators, <lb/>
            in order to obtain votes of honour from you : it becomes you <lb/>
            much rather to resent the attempts to injure you, which he <lb/>
            is shown to have made on every occasion when he has had <lb/>
            free liberty of action. All other men, who have ever obtained <lb/>
            a grant from you, have been honoured for services rendered : <lb/>
            this is the only one of all, who has been honoured for abortive <lb/>
            attempts to injure you. For such a man surely it was a <lb/>
            great mark of your kindness, to be released from the punish­ <lb/>
            ment which he merited. That is however not the opinion of <lb/>
            your orators : he must receive the titles of citizen and bene­ <lb/>
            factor, crowns and honours, for the presents which he gives <lb/>
            them in private. The rest of you sit like dupes, wondering <lb/>
            what it all means. And to finish it up, they would have <lb/>
            constituted you his protectors by virtue of this resolution of <lb/>
            Council, but for this indictment of ours ; and the common­ <lb/>
            wealth would have performed the part of his hireling and <lb/>
            retainer, and guarded the person of Charidemus. A fine <lb/>
            thing truly ! 0 Jupiter and the Gods !-that one who was <lb/>
            himself once a body-guardsman in the pay of your enemies, <lb/>
            should be publicly protected by your decree !</p>
          <p>Perhaps I may be asked, how it happens that having such <lb/>
            an accurate knowledge of these things, having closely traced <lb/>
            some of his delinquencies, I let him alone, and never made <lb/>
            any opposition either when you created him citizen or when <lb/>
            you gave him a vote of honour, nor, in short, took any notice <lb/>
            of him until after the passing of this decree. I, men of <lb/>
            Athens, will tell you the whole truth. I knew his un­ <lb/>
             <pb n="224"/>
            worthiness, and was present when these dignities were con­ <lb/>
            ferred upon him, and offered no opposition ; I confess. And <lb/>
            why ? Because, men of Athens, I thought in the first place, <lb/>
            that a multitude of persons, telling lies about him to you <lb/>
            without scruple, would be too strong for me singly speaking <lb/>
            the truth : and in the next place, I declare most solemnly, <lb/>
            I had no idea of envying him what he was seeking to cheat <lb/>
            you out of, and I did not see that any tremendous evil would <lb/>
            befal you, if you forgave a man all his offences and invited <lb/>
            him to render you service in future ; for in your crowning <lb/>
            and making a citizen of him both these things were involved. <lb/>
            But now that I see him contriving a new scheme, by which, <lb/>
            if he can only instruct people here to deceive you in his <lb/>
            behalf, your friends abroad, who would be glad to serve you <lb/>
            and prevent his attacking you, for example, Athenodorus, <lb/>
            Simon, Bianor, Archebius of Byzantium, the two Thracian <lb/>
            princes, will none of them be at liberty either to check or to <lb/>
            oppose him, I am here as his accuser. And I consider, <lb/>
            although to contest a grant, by which he was not likely to <lb/>
            injure the state vastly, would be like a man having a private <lb/>
            grievance or a vexatious object, to oppose him in a scheme <lb/>
            for doing the state a serious mischief is the act of an honest <lb/>
            man and a patriot. Therefore, although on the former <lb/>
            occasion I said nothing, I speak now.</p>
          <p>They have an argument however, by which they expect to <lb/>
            mislead you; that Cersobleptes and Charidemus acted <lb/>
            against the commonwealth perhaps, while they were enemies, <lb/>
            but now they are friends and make themselves useful: we <lb/>
            must not bear malice therefore; as, when we helped the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians, we did not remember any injury which they <lb/>
            did us whilst they were enemies, nor when we helped the <lb/>
            Thebans, and the Eubœans very lately. I conceive that this <lb/>
            argument would be in point, if they urged it on the occasion <lb/>
            of some critical motion, resisted by us, for succouring Cer­ <lb/>
            sobleptes and Charidemus : but if there is nothing of the <lb/>
            kind pending, if there is no such motion, and the purpose of <lb/>
            their argument is to make his generals unduly powerful by <lb/>
            getting impunity from you, I consider they are acting shame­ <lb/>
            fully. For it is not right, 0 Athenians, that the arguments <lb/>
            of men craving deliverance should be addressed to you in <lb/>
            favour of men seeking permission to do wrong. And inde­ <lb/>
             <pb n="225"/>
            pendently of this-if Charidemus did mischief while he was an <lb/>
            enemy, and had changed after professing to be a friend, perhaps <lb/>
            one might have listened to the plea; but since it is not so, <lb/>
            since he has deceived you most from the time that he has <lb/>
            pretended friendship, if you ought not to hate him for his <lb/>
            previous conduct, you ought surely to distrust him for this. <lb/>
            Upon the subject of not being revengeful, I will tell you <lb/>
            what I think. A man who revives his grievances with a view <lb/>
            to doing injury, is revengeful: a man who looks them up in <lb/>
            order to guard against injury, is wise.</p>
          <p>Perhaps however they will take a point of this kind-that <lb/>
            the man is now bent upon being our friend, and wishes to <lb/>
            render some service to the commonwealth, and we shall dis­ <lb/>
            courage him, if we condemn the decree, and cause him to <lb/>
            regard us with mistrust. Mark, 0 Athenians, what my <lb/>
            sentiments are. If he were our true and sincere friend, and <lb/>
            meant really to do us all the good in his power, even then I <lb/>
            could not have admitted such an argument: for I conceive <lb/>
            that, for no good that any man can do, ought you for his sake <lb/>
            to commit perjury and vote contrary to your convictions. <lb/>
            Since however he is proved to be guilty of deceit and dis­ <lb/>
            honesty, one of two good results will follow from your con­ <lb/>
            demning the decree. Either he will desist from his artifices, <lb/>
            thinking that they are no longer undiscovered; or, if he wishes <lb/>
            to be really connected with us, he will endeavour to render <lb/>
            us some service, knowing that by trickery he can no longer <lb/>
            accomplish his objects. So that for this reason at all events, <lb/>
            if for no other, it is expedient to give a verdict against him.</p>
          <p>It is worth your while also to inquire, 0 Athenians, <lb/>
            how it was that our ancestors awarded recompenses and <lb/>
            honours to real benefactors, whether they were citizens or <lb/>
            strangers. And if you see that they awarded them better <lb/>
            than you, it will be well to imitate them ; if you find your <lb/>
            own method the best, you can go on with it. In the first <lb/>
            place, Themistocles who gained the naval fight at Salamis, <lb/>
            and Miltiades who commanded at Marathon, and many others <lb/>
            whose services are not on a level with those of modern <lb/>
            generals, were not set up in brass by your ancestors, <lb/>
            nor received from them any extraordinary homage. Were <lb/>
            your ancestors then not grateful to their benefactors? <lb/>
            Assuredly they were, 0 Athenians: and they showed their <note type="footnote"> VOL. III. </note> <note type="footnote"> Q </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="226"/>
            gratitude in a manner worthy both of themselves and them: <lb/>
            for, high as were the merits of all, they elected these to be <lb/>
            their leaders; and to the wise, who will look at the truth of <lb/>
            things, it is a far greater honour than a brazen statue, to be <lb/>
            placed at the head of brave and honourable men. Verily, 1 <lb/>
            0 Athenians, your ancestors renounced not their share in any <lb/>
            of those glories ; and there is no one who will attribute the <lb/>
            battle of Salamis to Themistocles, but to the Athenians, nor <lb/>
            the battle of Marathon to Miltiades, but to the common­ <lb/>
            wealth. But now, 0 Athenians, people say that Timotheus <lb/>
            took Corcyra, and Iphicrates cut in pieces the Spartan <lb/>
            division, and Chabrias won the seafight at Naxos; for you <lb/>
            seem yourselves to resign the merit of those exploits by the <lb/>
            extravagance of the honours which you have given to each <lb/>
            of these men on their account.</p>
          <p>Thus honourably and advantageously for themselves did <lb/>
            they bestow their political rewards ; thus injudiciously do <lb/>
            we. But how the rewards of strangers ? Our forefathers, <lb/>
            when Menon the Pharsalian had given ten talents in money <lb/>
            for the war at Eion by Amphipolis, and succoured you with <lb/>
            three hundred cavalry of his own retainers, did not pass a <lb/>
            decree, that whoever killed him should be liable to arrest, <lb/>
            but gave him citizenship, and held that honour to be suffi­ <lb/>
            cient. And again when Perdiccas, who reigned in Macedonia <lb/>
            at the time of the barbarian invasion, destroyed the bar­ <lb/>
            barians retreating from Platæa, and completed the disaster <lb/>
            of the king, they did not pass a decree, that any one should <lb/>
            be liable to arrest if he killed Perdiccas, by whom war had been <lb/>
            declared against the king on our account; but they gave <lb/>
            him citizenship only. For then indeed so valuable was <lb/>
            Athenian citizenship esteemed by all men, that, in order to <lb/>
            obtain it, they were willing to render such important services ; <lb/>
            while now it is so worthless, that many of your adopted <lb/>
            citizens have done you more mischief than open enemies. <lb/>
            And not only has this gift of the commonwealth become vile <lb/>
            and contemptible, but all have become so through the <lb/>
            wickedness of the detestable and accursed orators, who draw <lb/>

            graceful cupidity to such an excess, that, like men who put <lb/>
            up wretched trumpery for auction, they sell your honours <lb/>
            and rewards at the cheapest prices, drawing for a number of <lb/>
            people on the same terms any decree they like to have.</p>
          <p>First-that I may begin with the latest examples-they <lb/>
            not only accorded to Ariobarzanes and his sons, three in <lb/>
            number, everything which they desired, but associated with <lb/>
            him two citizens of Abydus, deadly enemies of Athens and <lb/>
            men of the worst character, Philiscus and Agavus. Again- <lb/>
            when Timotheus was considered to have rendered you good <lb/>
            service, besides conferring upon him all the highest distinc­ <lb/>
            tions, they associated with him Phrasierides and Poly­ <lb/>
            ethenes, who were not even freemen, but rascals who had done <lb/>
            such things as decency forbids to mention. And on this last <lb/>
            occasion, when they were for giving such honours as they <lb/>

            they associate with him two persons, one of whom has done <lb/>
            all the mischief that you have heard, and the other, a man <lb/>
            named Euderces, no one knows anything about. It is from <lb/>
            such causes, 0 Athenians, that what was great heretofore <lb/>
            appears little now, and the thing is progressing even still <lb/>
            further, and these distinctions are no longer sufficient, but, <lb/>
            unless you guard the persons of each of these men, there is <lb/>
            no thanks, it would seem, for what you have done before. 1°</p>
          <p>That things have come to this disgraceful pass, if the truth <lb/>
            must be spoken with freedom, is owing, men of Athens, prin­ <lb/>
            cipally to yourselves. For you like no longer even to bring <lb/>
            offenders to justice, but the practice is gone out of the <lb/>
            commonwealth. Yet look how your ancestors chastised those <lb/>
            who offended them, and see whether they did it in your <lb/>
            style. When they found Themistocles arrogating superiority <lb/>
            over them, they banished him from the city, and condemned <lb/>
            him for correspondence with the Mede.2 And Cimon, because <note type="footnote"> 1 Thus Auger: " si vous ne vous constituez a la garde de chacun de <lb/>

            his work. Themistocles was not unconscious of this merit, nor careful <lb/>
            to suppress his sense of it. He was thought to indicate it too plainly <lb/>
            when he dedicated a temple to Artemis under the title of Aristobule, <lb/>
            the Goddess of good counsel; and the offence was aggravated, if he <lb/>
            himself placed his statue there, where it was still seen in the days of <lb/>
            Plutarch, who pronounces the form no less heroic than the soul of the <lb/>
            man. In the same spirit are several stories, related by Plutarch, of the <lb/>
            indiscretion with which he sometimes alluded to the magnitude of the <lb/>
            debt which his countrymen owed him. If on one occasion he asked <lb/>
            them : where they would have been without him ? and on another <lb/>
            compared himself to a spreading plane, under which they had taken <lb/>
            shelter in the storm, but which they began to lop and rend when the <lb/>
            sky grew clear : he would seem not to have discovered till it was too <lb/>
            late, that there are obligations which neither princes nor nations can <lb/>
            endure, and which are forfeited if they are not disclaimed.... </note><note type="footnote"> "Themistocles was gradually supplanted in the public favour by <lb/>
            men worthy indeed to be his rivals, but who owed their victory less to <lb/>
            their own merit than to the towering preeminence of his deserts. He <lb/>
            himself, as we have observed, seconded them by his indiscretion in <lb/>
            their endeavours to persuade the people that he had risen too high <lb/>
            above the common level to remain a harmless citizen in a free state: <lb/>
            that his was a case which called for the extraordinary remedy pre­ <lb/>
            scribed by the laws against the power and greatness of an individual, <lb/>
            which threatened to overlay the young democracy. He was condemned <lb/>
            to temporary exile by the same process of ostracism which he had <lb/>
            himself before directed against Aristides. He took up his abode at <lb/>
            Argus, which he had served in his prosperity, and which welcomed, <lb/>
            if not the saviour of Greece, at least the enemy of Sparta. Here he <lb/>
            was still residing, though he occasionally visited other cities of Pelo­ <lb/>
            ponnesus, when Pausanias was convicted of his treason. In searching <lb/>
            for further traces of his plot, the ephors found some part of a corre­ <lb/>
            spondence between him and Themistocles, which appeared to afford <lb/>
            sufficient ground for charging the Athenian with having shared his <lb/>
            friend's crime. They immediately sent ambassadors to Athens to <lb/>
            accuse him, and to insist that he should be punished in like manner <lb/>

            (Herodotus, vi. 136.) Cimon, after his reduction of Thasos, was thought <lb/>
            to have neglected opportunities of conquest in Macedonia, and was <lb/>
            charged with having taken bribes from king Alexander. Upon this <lb/>
            charge, in which Pericles appeared as one of his accusers, he was <lb/>
            acquitted. (Plutarch, Vit. Cimon 14.) Upon his return from the Mes­ <lb/>
            senian war, in which he had advised the Athenians to send succour to <lb/>
            Sparta, he lost his popularity, and his political enemies took advantage <lb/>
            of it to accomplish his expulsion by ostracism. (Plutarch, ibid. 17.) In <lb/>
            less than five years he was recalled. But he never underwent any <lb/>
            trial upon which a fine was imposed on him. (See Thirlwall's History <lb/>

            ticians of this stamp, with all the waste they make of it, are <lb/>
            unable to extinguish, 0 Athenians, and no wonder. For <lb/>
            Aristides then, who was empowered to assess the tribute, did <lb/>
            not increase his fortune by a single drachm; but, when he <lb/>

            stides was chosen to assess this tribute, and so conducted himself as to <lb/>
            give universal satisfaction, as we are told by Plutarch in his life of that <lb/>
            statesman. Thirlwall's account of it is as follows : (Hist. of Greece, <lb/>
            ii. p. 371.) </note><note type="footnote"> " It was Aristides who had the glory of establishing his country in <lb/>
            this honourable and well-earned preeminence, as his personal character <lb/>
            had been most instrumental toward inspiring the confidence on which <lb/>
            it was founded. After ascertaining that the proposal of the Ionians <lb/>
            was the result not of hasty passion, but of a settled purpose, he <lb/>
            undertook the task, which was entrusted to him by general consent, of <lb/>
            regulating the laws of the union and of its subordination to Athens. <lb/>
            The object of the confederacy was to protect the Greeks in the islands <lb/>
            and the coasts of the Ægean from the aggression of the Persians, and <lb/>
            to weaken and humble the barbarians. All who shared the benefit <lb/>
            were to contribute according to the measure of their ability to the <lb/>
            common end: Athens was to collect their forces, to wield and direct <lb/>
            them, not however with absolute and arbitrary power, but as the organ <lb/>
            of the public will, possessing only the influence and authority due to <lb/>
            the greater sacrifices she made to the common cause. Least of all was <lb/>
            she to interfere in the constitution and internal administration of any <lb/>
            of the allied cities. All were to be independent of her and of each <lb/>
            other, except so far as they were bound together by the same danger <lb/>
            and the same interest. Aristides executed the difficult and delicate <lb/>
            task of fixing the assessments of the numerous members of the con­ <lb/>
            federacy, so as to satisfy all without incurring even a suspicion of <lb/>
            having turned one among so many opportunities of gain to his own <lb/>
            advantage. Perhaps other Greeks might also have resisted the tempta­ <lb/>
            tion: he seems to have been the only one that Was acknowledged to <lb/>
            be above calumny. Some of the allies were to furnish money: the <lb/>
            more powerful were to equip ships. The whole amount of the yearly <lb/>
            contribution was settled at 460 talents, about 115,000 pounds : Delos, <lb/>
            the ancient centre of Ionian commerce and religion, was chosen for the <lb/>
            treasury of the confederates, and its temples as the place where their <lb/>
            deputies were to hold their congress." </note> <lb/>

            all the rest of the Greeks, so that, for whatsoever period you <lb/>
            voted an expedition, you went out with pay for the whole <lb/>
            time. Now the persons who manage our state affairs have <lb/>
            risen from indigence to wealth, and provided themselves <lb/>
            with plenty to last them for support; whilst you have not <lb/>
            provisions in your stores for a single day, but, when anything <lb/>
            is to be done, you are destitute of means. For the people <lb/>
            were formerly masters of the statesmen, but now are their <lb/>
            servants. The fault is theirs who propose such decrees, and <lb/>
            accustom you to despise yourselves and hold one or two indi­ <lb/>
            viduals in respect. These persons then become the heirs of <lb/>
            your renown and your possessions; you have not the least <lb/>
            enjoyment of them, but are witnesses of the prosperity of <lb/>
            others, and come in for nothing but to be cheated. How <lb/>
            deep would be the groaning1 of those men who died for <lb/>
            freedom and for glory, who left memorials of so many noble <lb/>
            deeds, could they see that Athens has acquired the rank and <lb/>
            style of a dependant, and is deliberating whether she must <lb/>
            guard the person of Charidemus! Charidemus! alas the <lb/>
            day!</p>
          <p>And yet this is not the cruel part of it, that we deliberate <lb/>
            less wisely than our forefathers, whose merits are transcendent, <lb/>
            but that we do it worse than any people. Is it not disgrace­ <lb/>

            these men, should they attempt to mislead and impose on <lb/>
            you. The first law has positively declared, that, if any one <lb/>
            kill another, the council shall have cognizance : Aristocrates <note type="footnote"> 1 Xenophon (Hellen. i. c. 6, a. 32) says, <foreign xml:lang="grc">῞Ερμων ὁ Μεγαρεὺς, ὁ τῷ <lb/>

            franchise. Of this however there is no evidence. May not Xenophon <lb/>
            call him a Megarian, because he lived at Megara ? </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Cynosarges was an eastern suburb of Athens, and formed one of <lb/>
            the Attic townships. Here was a temple of Hercules and a gymnasium, <lb/>
            which, as we learn from Plutarch, was frequented by strangers and <lb/>
            Athenians of half-blood. Hercules was a half-god, born of a mortal <lb/>
            mother, and was the natural patron of the base-born or illegitimate. <lb/>
            (See Aristophanes, Aves, 1650, &amp;c. Plutarch, Vit. Themist. init. Pau­ <lb/>
            sanias, i. 19.) The registration of this class which Demosthenes speaks <lb/>
            of was, I presume, for the purpose of taxation. Pabst renders the <lb/>
            words: so wie eAedem hier zu Kynosarges die von nicht ehrbarer Geburt <lb/>

            after the words, " if any one shall kill," has immediately added, <lb/>
            that he may be lawfully apprehended. Keep this in your <lb/>
            remembrance, that to try a man, and to proscribe him <lb/>
            without allowing trial, are the most opposite things in the <lb/>
            world. Again, the second law forbids one to ill-use or <lb/>
            extort money from even a convicted murderer: the de­ <lb/>
            fendant, in making him liable to arrest, has allowed all these <lb/>
            things; for it will be in the power of the captors to do what <lb/>
            they please. The law requires him to be carried before the <lb/>
            Judges, even though he be taken in the native land of the <lb/>
            deceased: Aristocrates has permitted the very man who <lb/>
            brings the charge to carry him to his own house, even <lb/>
            though he has taken him in a foreign country. There are <lb/>
            certain offences for which the law has given permission to <lb/>
            take life : Aristocrates, without any preamble, even if life be <lb/>
            taken under such circumstances, gives up to punishment a <lb/>
            man whom the law lets off with impunity. If such misfortune <lb/>
            has occurred to any one, the law requires that satisfaction <lb/>
            shall first be demanded : Aristocrates on the contrary, with­ <lb/>
            out himself appointing any trial, without demanding satisfac­ <lb/>
            tion from the persons against whom his claim is, declares at <lb/>
            once that the homicide may be arrested, and, whoever <lb/>
            attempts to rescue him, he excludes that instant from the <lb/>
            benefit of our alliance. The laws ordain that hostages to the <lb/>
            number of three may be taken from the people among whom <lb/>
            the homicide dwells, if they refuse to render justice: the <lb/>
            defendant, if any one should rescue him from the captor, not <lb/>
            liking to give him up before judgment, excludes him from <lb/>
            our alliance immediately. The legislator forbids any one to <lb/>
            introduce a law, unless he make it the same for all: the de­ <lb/>
            fendant frames a special decree for an individual. The law <lb/>
            does not permit a decree to be of greater validity than a law: <lb/>
            Aristocrates, when so many laws are in existence, annuls them, <lb/>
            and establishes a decree.</p>
          <p>Keep these things in your memory while you sit in judg­ <lb/>
            ment. Reject, refuse to hear the arguments by which they <lb/>
            will strive to lead you astray, but bid them show you, where <lb/>
            he has ordered any trial, or where he has said that the party <lb/>
            convicted of murder shall suffer the penalty. Had he either <lb/>
            said that any party tried and condemned elsewhere should <lb/>
            be punished, or himself appointed a trial to determine the <lb/>
             <pb n="234"/>
            fact of homicide, or whether it were justifiable or unjusti­ <lb/>
            fiable, he would have done no wrong. But when after em­ <lb/>
            ploying the simple term of accusation, "if any one shall <lb/>
            kill," and omitting to add, "and shall be convicted of <lb/>
            murder," or " shall be adjudged to have killed," or " let him <lb/>
            submit to judgment for the murder," or "he shall be <lb/>
            amenable to the same penalty as if he killed an Athenian”— <lb/>
            omitting (in short) everything that is just-he has inserted <lb/>
            a clause for the arrest of the homicide; do not be imposed <lb/>
            on, but rest assured that his decree is a most complete <lb/>
            violation of law.</p><pb n="235"/>

            <title type="sub">CHARACTER OF THE LEPTINEAN ORATION.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THIS Oration, one of the first which established the high reputation <lb/>
            of Demosthenes for eloquence, has always been greatly admired. <lb/>
            Ancient critics, among whom it bore the title of the “Oration on the <lb/>
            Immunities," are unanimous in praising it: nor has it received less <lb/>
            commendation in modem times. It is not animated with the glowing <lb/>
            eloquence of the Philippics, but it has merits and beauties of another <lb/>
            kind. Here we have Demosthenes in the character of the sound <lb/>
            constitutional lawyer, or rather the sagacious politician, warning his <lb/>
            countrymen against the dangers of an unwise measure of legislation. <lb/>
            The speech is such as an enlightened member of the English Parlia­ <lb/>
            ment might address to the House of Lords or Commons, or to a Com­ <lb/>
            mittee, upon the merits of some proposed bill or its clauses: with <lb/>
            this difference however, that it is a rare thing for an Englishman to <lb/>
            produce an elaborate work of art like this which the Athenian has <lb/>
            handed down to posterity.</p>
          <p>Dionysius says, that of all the speeches of Demosthenes this is the <lb/>
            most elegant and perfect in point of composition.1 Cicero speaks of <lb/>
            it as being peculiarly subtle in argument.2 Undoubtedly one of the <lb/>
            remarkable characteristics of this Oration is its close, careful, and <lb/>
            (speaking in a good sense) artful method of reasoning. But on an­ <lb/>
            other ground also it merits our peculiar attention; I mean, for the <lb/>
            purity of sentiment and high tone of political morality which it <lb/>
            breathes throughout. This, which in some measure redounds to the <lb/>
            credit of the Athenians themselves, has not escaped the notice of <lb/>
            ancient writers. Plutarch tells us, it was remarked by Panætius the <lb/>
            Stoic, that Demosthenes usually represented virtue and honour as <lb/>
            things to be chosen for their own sake; more especially in the Oration <lb/>
            on the Crown, in that against Aristocrates, that on the Immunities, <lb/>
            and the Philippics, where he urges his countrymen to disregard <lb/>
            pleasure, profit, and ease, and in some cases to postpone even safety <lb/>
            and security to the honourable and the becoming. If we examine <lb/>
            the arguments of the Leptinea, we shall find this praise to be just. <note type="footnote"> (1) <foreign xml:lang="grc">Χαριέστατος ἁπάντων τω̃ν λόγωνκαὶ γραφικώτατος</foreign>.

            </p>
          <p>While the orator does not lose sight of other topics likely to exer­ <lb/>
            cise an influence upon his hearers, such as the necessity of preserving <lb/>
            to the people their privilege of making grants, the importance of <lb/>
            holding out rewards as a stimulus to good conduct, the danger of <lb/>
            alienating friends and benefactors, the illegal character of the proposed <lb/>
            statute, and the like; he appeals still more confidently and vehemently <lb/>
            to the noble and generous sentiments of his countrymen; remind­ <lb/>
            ing them that it was their duty to keep good faith, to maintain <lb/>
            the character of their ancestors for truth and honour; that they <lb/>
            should not do as a people what they would be ashamed to do as private <lb/>
            individuals; that a good name was better than riches for a state. <lb/>
            Gratitude was a topic naturally arising out of the question in debate; <lb/>
            since by the law of Leptines certain rewards which had been given <lb/>
            for services were to be abolished. To this Demosthenes recurs again <lb/>
            and again, putting it in every kind of shape, and in connexion with <lb/>
            it citing the names and deeds of many eminent benefactors. The <lb/>
            case of Epicerdes the Cyrenæan was a striking one; he had assisted <lb/>
            the Athenians at times when they were in the greatest distress, and <lb/>
            when he could have had very little hope of ever receiving a return. <lb/>
            " All people who rendered service should be requited," says Demo­ <lb/>
            sthenes, "but especially those who rendered it at a critical time like <lb/>
            Epicerdes." He seems to dwell with particular pleasure on the <lb/>
            glorious actions of Chabrias, whose son's cause he was partly advo­ <lb/>
            cating. Chabrias had lost his life in battle. Demosthenes presses <lb/>
            this most happily upon the court:—“ It would be shameful to deprive <lb/>
            the son of a reward, which had been earned by making him an orphan. <lb/>
            Chabrias was distinguished for being a safe and cautious general: but <lb/>
            his caution was exercised purely on his country's behalf: his own life <lb/>
            he willingly threw away to serve her." He winds up with a bold <lb/>
            declaration to the jury—“ It is not the law that is tried, whether it <lb/>
            be a proper one or otherwise: you are on your probation, whether or <lb/>
            no you are fit people to receive benefits in future." Gratitude is <lb/>
            a frequent theme of declamation; and it is not a very difficult one; <lb/>
            for the duty is acknowledged by all hearts. Demosthenes handles it <lb/>
            not as a declaimer, but as an orator. Let us see how the same sub­ <lb/>
            ject has been treated by Cicero. It is profitable and interesting to <lb/>
            compare the two orators together. The Roman was deeply imbued <lb/>
            with Attic lore, an ardent admirer of Demosthenes, often an imitator; <lb/>
            yet how different are their styles. Thus he dilates on gratitude, in the <lb/>
            Oration Pro Plancip, 33.</p>
          <p>"Etenim, judices, cum omnibus virtutibus me affectum esse <lb/>
            cupiam, tamen nihil est quod malim quam me et gratum esse et <lb/>
            videri. Hæc est enim una virtus non solum maxima, sed etiam <lb/>
            mater virtutum omnium reliquarum. Quid est pietas nisi voluntas <lb/>
            grata in parentes P qui sunt boni cives, qui belli, qui domi de patria. <lb/>
            bene merentes, nisi qui patriæ beneficia meminerunt ? qui sancti, qui <lb/>
            religionum colentes, nisi qui meritam this immortalibus gratiam justis <lb/>
             <pb n="237"/>
            honoribus et memori mente persolvunt ? Quæ potest esse jucunditas <lb/>
            vitæ, sublatis amicitiis P quæ porro amicitia potest esse inter ingratos? <lb/>
            Quis est nostrum liberatiter educate cui non educatores, cui non <lb/>
            magistri sui atque doctores, cui non locus ille mutus ipse, ubi altus <lb/>
            aut doctus est, cum gratâ recordatione in mente versetur ? Cujus <lb/>
            opes tantæ esse possunt, aut umquam fuerunt, quæ sine multorum <lb/>
            amicorum officiis stare possint ? quæ certe sublata memoriâ et gratiâ <lb/>
            nullæ exstare possunt. Equidem nil tarn proprium hominis existimo, <lb/>
            quam non modo beneficio sed etiam benevolentiæ significatione alli­ <lb/>
            gari: nihil porro tarn inhumanum, tarn immane, tarn ferum, quam <lb/>
            committere ut beneficio non dicam indignus, sed victus esse videare."</p>
          <p>No less strong is the language of Shakspeare in the Twelfth Night, <lb/>
            Act III. Scene 4.- <lb/>
            I hate ingratitude more in a man <lb/>
            Than lying, vainness, babbling, drunkenness, <lb/>
            Or any taint of vice, whose strong corruption <lb/>
            Inhabits our frail blood.</p>
          <p>Demosthenes denounces the law of Leptines as tainted with the <lb/>
            vices of envy and jealousy; vices not only odious in themselves, but <lb/>
            un-Athenian: for it had always been the habit of his countrymen to <lb/>
            admire and to reward distinguished merit of every kind: of which <lb/>
            the funeral honours paid to the brave who fell in battle were an <lb/>
            example. The people should rejoice at any glorious achievements of <lb/>
            a fellow-citizen; for by them the fame of the republic was exalted. <lb/>
            In the same strain we find Cicero speaking, in the Oration Pro <lb/>
            Archiâ, 9: "At its laudibus certè non solum ipsi qui laudantur, sed <lb/>
            etiam populi Romani nomen ornatur. In ccelum hujus proavus Cato <lb/>
            tollitur: magnus honos populi Romani rebus adjungitur. Omnes <lb/>
            denique illi Maximi, Marcelli, Fulvii, non sine communi omnium <lb/>
            nostrum laude decorantur."</p>
          <p>Again, he warns the Athenians in solemn but respectful terms- <lb/>
            (and looking at what betel them in less than twenty years after, one <lb/>
            cannot fail to be struck by the warning)—that they should not abolish <lb/>
            the rewards formerly given for eminent services under the idea that <lb/>
            such services were not then needed. An occasion might arise which <lb/>
            called for extraordinary services, such as those rendered by the <lb/>
            patriots of olden time. In legislation they ought not to assume <lb/>
            the impossibility of such an occurrence. The language of their laws <lb/>
            should be as cautious as that of common life, in which all arrogance <lb/>
            of expression was eschewed, as offensive to gods and men. He appeals <lb/>
            more especially to that reverence for Nemesis, which formed a part <lb/>
            of the Greek religion. The admonition however is pregnant with <lb/>
            eternal truth, and applicable to all times and circumstances.</p>
          <p>I have said enough to show the high moral character of the Oration, <lb/>
            which indeed cannot be too carefully studied. We are fortunate in <lb/>
            having an excellent edition of it by F. A. Wolf, whose Commentary <lb/>
            has not only cleared away a great many difficulties from the text, but <lb/>
             <pb n="238"/>
            elucidated the whole subject of the Attic law to which it relates. <lb/>
            Together with the speech of Demosthenes he has thought fit to pub­ <lb/>
            lish that of Aristides the Rhetorician, a scholastic exercise upon the <lb/>
            same subject, scarcely worth reading on its own account, but affording <lb/>
            matter of interest to the learned from its being an imitation of the <lb/>
            great Athenian master. The Editor assigns his reasons for publishing <lb/>
            it in his Prolegomena, of which I subjoin an extract, translated and <lb/>
            somewhat abbreviated:</p>
          <p>" The Oration of Aristides belongs to a class which the Greek <lb/>
            rhetoricians call Exercises; the Latin, Declamations. There were <lb/>
            three different kinds of them. Some men wrote on imaginary argu­ <lb/>
            ments and general questions; others took up real subjects and causes, <lb/>
            which they found in ancient history, and employed themselves in <lb/>
            composing accusations or defences, speeches for or against wars or <lb/>
            treaties, descriptions of manners, places, and countries. But since <lb/>
            on subjects like these every man would add, suppress, or alter facts <lb/>
            at his pleasure, partly carried away by the ardour of authorship, <lb/>
            partly through apprehension that the necessity for repeating old and <lb/>
            hackneyed stories would leave no scope for the praise of originality; <lb/>
            truth was often so metamorphosed under their hands, that she became <lb/>
            unlike herself: and from such cause to this day there remain in his­ <lb/>
            tory some splendid fictions. Although these two classes' which I <lb/>
            have mentioned were in the highest estimation, when eloquence, the <lb/>
            foster-child of ancient freedom, had been silenced and banished from <lb/>
            the forum, degraded from her dignity by the domination of kings; <lb/>
            yet they existed and were held in honour long before those times. <lb/>
            Afterwards there arose a new tribe of rhetoricians; who, not satisfied <lb/>
            with training their pupils to the general imitation of the ancients, <lb/>
            ventured to propose for a sort of contest the very arguments which <lb/>
            from them had received celebrity. Confident fellows one must call <lb/>
            them, and forgetful of themselves and their age, to suppose that <lb/>
            a subject, illustrated in the light of the forum by the power of pre­ <lb/>
            eminent genius in the flourishing days of Greece, could be brightened <lb/>
            up afresh under the hands of tiros in the shade of the school! Yet <lb/>
            even here the masters themselves led the way, entering first into the <lb/>
            contest of art: and there were distinguished Sophists, who used, as <lb/>
            an agreeable exercise, to declaim within their own walls against <lb/>
            Philip of Macedon, against Midias, or against Catiline. One example <lb/>
            of this kind is the Oration of Aristides, an eminent teacher of Rhetoric <lb/>
            in the second century.1 * * * * <note type="footnote"> (1) This would appear to have been a favourite subject in the schools of rhetoric. <lb/>
            For, before Aristides, it was taken up by Lollian, who flourished in Hadrian's reign, <lb/>
            as we learn from Philostratus in the Lives of the Sophists, i. 527. He has preserved <lb/>
            a fragment of the declamation, the thunders of which are certainly not of a character <lb/>
            which causes us greatly to regret their extinction. Attacking the Law of Leptines, <lb/>
            on the ground that it prevented corn coming to Athens from the Euxine, he says­ <lb/>
            “The mouth of the Euxine is closed by a statute; a few words intercept the food of <lb/>
            the Athenians; the same effect is produced by Lysander fighting and by Leptines <lb/>
            legislating." </note> <pb n="239"/>
             </p>
          <p>" The principal use of the Oration of Aristides is, that, since very <lb/>
            few specimens of declamatory composition have come down to us, <lb/>
            and none of them is more eminent than this, we may see, by com­ <lb/>
            paring it with the speech of Demosthenes, how unsuccessful - the <lb/>
            imitation is, by what marks a style of meretricious ornament is a- <lb/>
            tinguished from the natural beauties of the ancient and real elo­ <lb/>
            quence. For how entirely different from that declaimer of the school <lb/>
            does the Attic orator sound. The Leptinean speech is indeed one of <lb/>
            the quiet kind, employed wholly in convincing, rather than exciting <lb/>
            the hearer; and possesses not the force and grandeur of language <lb/>
            and sentiments which we admire in the Philippics and some other <lb/>
            speeches, which are usually regarded as models of the Demosthenic <lb/>
            character. Here everything is calm, temperate, carefully worked <lb/>
            out, and of an equable tenor. This indeed is the highest excellence <lb/>
            of oratory, to know how the style should be varied according to the <lb/>
            subject. And none better understood this art than our orator; and <lb/>
            for this single reason one might think him justly preferable to all <lb/>
            whom either that or any following age produced. So plain and con­ <lb/>
            cise is he in some of the private orations composed for small causes; <lb/>
            so copious, dignified, and grand in his Philippics; that one would <lb/>
            scarcely recognise the same hand in both. But between these two <lb/>
            classes of his speeches there is a third, in which he opposes laws or <lb/>
            popular decrees ; and for which he has been specially commended by <lb/>
            ancient critics. Of the highest rank in this class is the celebrated <lb/>
            Oration on the Crown, though it is more akin to the loftier class. <lb/>
            Next to this I am inclined to place the Leptinean; certainly, out of <lb/>
            the four Orations in this same class, those against Androtion, Aristo­ <lb/>
            crates, Aristogiton, Timocrates, none ought to be preferred to this.; <lb/>
            and only that against Androtion can be put on a par with it.</p>
          <p>" The style of the Leptinea is so subtle, that it is scarcely sur­ <lb/>
            passed by any writer except Lysias, who is all subtlety. And he that <lb/>
            knows the force of this quality and the difficulty of attaining it, and <lb/>
            is aware how highly the ancients rated it, will think, I am sure, that <lb/>
            Cicero's testimony is a high one, when he commends the Oration on <lb/>
            this special ground. Such an excellence indeed can only be appre­ <lb/>
            ciated by one who brings an ear habituated to notice various pecu­ <lb/>
            liarities of style: but the truth and beauty and loftiness of the <lb/>
            sentiments must be perceptible even to readers of less learning. <lb/>
            These are derived from the common source of everything that is <lb/>
            most eminent in a speaker—an elevated and liberal mmd that holds <lb/>
            cheap what the vulgar regard as precious: which is best seen in <lb/>
            those passages, where the orator contends that inviolability of faith <lb/>
            and the honour of the commonwealth are to be preferred to all other <lb/>
            considerations. Every part of this speech is full of such principles,­ <lb/>
            and every argument turns on them: and therefore we are not sur­ <lb/>
            prised to read, that it was the favourite of Panætius the Stoic, who, <lb/>

             <pb n="240"/>
            the precepts of his philosophy, and held that it was to be followed in <lb/>
            every action, even though it might be repugnant to interest.</p>
          <p>"What force and weight there is in the arguments by which <lb/>
            Demosthenes refutes the reasoning of his adversaries! You would <lb/>
            feel indignant if the judges had not decided in his favour, especially <lb/>
            when that weight of argument is tempered throughout with the <lb/>
            utmost mildness in refutation. This will be matter of surprise to <lb/>
            those who have been told that there are few instances of it in <lb/>
            Demosthenes. The orator however, accustomed as he was to attempt <lb/>
            nothing unseemly or unsuited to the occasion, besides that he had <lb/>
            other reasons perhaps inclining him to moderation,1 would of course <lb/>
            be influenced by the character of his opponent, and the age and rank <lb/>
            of those who had been selected to defend the caused We are ignorant <lb/>
            indeed who Leptines was; but I think we may be nearly sure he was <lb/>
            a man of political influence and power, so that even Demosthenes <lb/>
            might have thought himself obliged to spare his dignity, and to treat <lb/>
            him with lenity and forbearance: so that, if anywhere he censures <lb/>
            the individual, he does so with self-restraint, and never in bitter or <lb/>
            insulting language. For when expressions appear a little rough to <lb/>
            us, we must remember that they appeared very different to a Greek <lb/>
            audience, and especially to Athenians, who were accustomed to hear <lb/>
            their most eminent citizens assailing each other with the bitterest <lb/>
            reproaches. Since the present Oration is free from any such de­ <lb/>
            formity, it is so much the better suited to the feelings and temper of <lb/>
            our age, and has a merit peculiarly recommending it to the modem <lb/>
            studier of eloquence. Any one who has well considered the beauty <lb/>
            and elegance of this speech, and has also carefully examined the art <lb/>
            which is not apparent on the first view, will rise from its perusal <lb/>
            with the feeling that he has derived great assistance both for <lb/>
            criticism and for composition. There is one thing more, to which <lb/>
            I would direct the reader's attention—I mean, the abundance and <lb/>
            variety of topics into which Demosthenes has expanded his argu­ <lb/>
            ment, penetrating (as it were) into the inmost recesses of the sub­ <lb/>
            ject, yet not urging sophistically anything far-fetched or foreign to <lb/>
            the question, but seizing and turning to his purpose every circum­ <lb/>
            stance which could throw light upon it, or influence the judges in his <lb/>
            own favour: so that one wonders what Phormio could have said on <lb/>
            the same points, if he left all those topics for Demosthenes, when <lb/>
            Demosthenes appears to have left nothing for any speaker that <lb/>
            followed him."</p>
          <p>I mentioned in the Argument to the Oration, that, with respect to <lb/>
            the issue of this contest, which Dio Chrysostom states to have been <lb/>
            in favour of Demosthenes, a doubt had been raised by Christopher <lb/>
            Wordsworth in his "Athens and Attica." He tells us tat page 140), <note type="footnote"> (1) For example; that the time had gone by for punishing Leptines. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) The advocates. See page 49. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="241"/>
            that in the outside of the southern wall, to the west of the Theatre, <lb/>
            he found an inscription, of which the following is a translation:1</p>
          <p>“The Cecropid tribe gained the prize with a chorus of boys, of <lb/>
            which Ctesippus the son of Chabrias defrayed the expense."</p>
          <p>Upon which he remarks:</p>
          <p>"This small fragment of a marble slab is a curious historical <lb/>
            document. It informs us of a fact which cannot be learnt elsewhere. <lb/>
            It communicates the result of one of the most important orations of <lb/>
            Demosthenes. His Oration against Leptines was composed in behalf <lb/>
            of Ctesippus, the dissolute son of Chabrias, who is mentioned in the <lb/>
            above inscription: its object was to secure to Ctesippus. the im­ <lb/>
            munity from public burdens, which he enjoyed in consequence of the <lb/>
            exploits of his father, and of which the law of Leptines threatened to <lb/>
            deprive him. Of these public burdens the Choragia was one of the <lb/>
            most onerous. This marble presents us with a proof that Ctesippus <lb/>
            performed the office of Choragus. Demosthenes therefore failed in <lb/>
            his attempt."</p>
          <p>In a note, which is inserted below,' he argues from the language <lb/>
            of Dio Chrysostom, that his statement is not worthy of credit: for <lb/>
            the language of Dio seems to import that Leptines was condemned <lb/>
            in person; whereas we know from the Oration of Demosthenes, that <lb/>
            this was not so, but that Leptines was safe, and the law itself only <lb/>
            was impugned.</p>
          <p>With respect to this last point, I should be inclined to think with <lb/>
            F. A. Wolf, that the words of Dio, though perhaps somewhat loose, <lb/>
            do not necessarily import anything further than that Leptines lost <lb/>
            the verdict. With respect to the inscription, I can only venture to <lb/>
            suggest, that it may be reconciled with Dio's statement, by sup­ <lb/>
            posing, either that Ctesippus performed the service in the interval <lb/>
            while the law was in force, after the prosecution of Bathippus had <lb/>
            been withdrawn, and before the verdict in favour of Demosthenes; <lb/>
            or that Ctesippus volunteered to undertake an office which by law he <lb/>
            was not compellable to serve. <note type="footnote"> (1) The original is, <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κεκροπις παιδων ενικα Κτησιππος Χαβριου εχορηγει</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) “Dio Chrysostom indeed asserts that Leptines was condemned; <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑάλω γραφη̃ς</foreign>. <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>I AM here to speak of the duties of Choragus and Gymnasiarch, <lb/>
            the feasting of the tribes, and the conduct of religious embassies. <lb/>
            These were called Encyclic or Ordinary Services,1 because they regu­ <lb/>
            larly recurred, and were thus distinguished from the Trierarchy, <lb/>
            which was an extraordinary one, to be performed only in time of war. <lb/>
            They were partly of an honorary and partly of a burdensome character, <lb/>
            the performance being attended with considerable expense; and <lb/>
            therefore they were exacted only of the wealthier classes. That they <lb/>
            were established as early as the reign of the Pisistratids, we are <lb/>
            informed by Aristotle in his Œconomics.2 They were afterwards <lb/>
            regularly kept up, and regarded as an important part of the public <lb/>
            economy of Athens: for, although the state derived no benefit from <lb/>
            them for the necessary purposes of administration, they contributed <lb/>
            to defray the cost of those scenic exhibitions and amusements, to <lb/>
            which the Athenians were so devoted, and which indeed formed a <lb/>
            part of their religion. Each tribe nominated such of its members as <lb/>
            were qualified to undertake the burdensome duties; no one (it seems) <lb/>
            being liable to them, whose estate was less than three talents. The <lb/>
            only persons regularly exempt were the Archons, heiresses, minors, <lb/>
            and orphans until the second year after their coming of age. As to <lb/>
            special exemptions conferred by way of honour, enough has been said <lb/>
            in the Leptinean Oration.</p>
          <p>I. The Choragus was a person who provided a chorus to sing, <lb/>
            dance, or play at any of the public festivals. In the Athenian drama <lb/>
            the chorus was by no means the least important part, nor the least <note type="footnote"> (1) <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἐγκύκλιοι λειτουργίαι</foreign>. On the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">λειτουργία</foreign> F. A. Wolf has the following <lb/>

              costly item in the performance. A company of fifteen was usually <lb/>
              required for tragedy, twenty-four for comedy. The Cyclic or Dithy­ <lb/>
              rambic chorus was composed of fifty men or boys, who sang to the <lb/>
              lyre, dancing or marching in step to the music. There were also the <lb/>
              Pyrrhichists, who performed the war-dance; and the band of flute- <lb/>
              players, which, as we learn from the Oration against Midias was the <lb/>
              most expensive of all.1</p>
          <p>It was the business of the Choragus to find the choristers for these <lb/>
            various exhibitions, to pay for their training, and to maintain them <lb/>
            during the period of service. Their diet was to be such as would <lb/>
            keep them in good training order, their limbs agile, their voices strong <lb/>
            and clear. A chorus of boys was not always easy to be got; for <lb/>
            parents did not like to give up their children for the purpose. It <lb/>
            seems however, they might be pressed into the service, or even taken <lb/>
            by violence from their homes; at least, the practice was connived at; <lb/>
            for the people were determined to have their diversion at any rate.2 <lb/>
            The expense of all this fell upon the Choragus; and he had also to <lb/>
            provide dresses, crowns, masks, and other ornaments and decorations.</p>
          <p>His office, though sometimes discharged by deputy, was strictly <lb/>
            a personal one. He was expected to superintend the arrangements, <lb/>
            and to be present during the performance, attired in the proper cos­ <lb/>
            tume, as a sort of master of the ceremonies. Hence his name, signi­ <lb/>
            fying that he was Choir-master, or Director of the Chorus. And <lb/>
            hence minors and heiresses, who were incapable of serving the office <lb/>
            in person, were exempt from it.</p>
          <p>The expense was increased by the competition among the different <lb/>
            Choragi, especially in dramatic contests. Tripods were awarded as <note type="footnote"> (1) Burges, in the Glossary to his translation of the speech against Midias, under <lb/>
            title <foreign xml:lang="grc">Χορηγει̃ν</foreign>, writes as follows: </note><note type="footnote"> "None have been able to explain why the chorus of flute-players was the most <lb/>
            expensive of all. The fact is, they had to be brought either from Boeotia or Asia <lb/>
            Minor; and at Athens, as elsewhere, foreign artists were more expensive than native. <lb/>
            Had Donaldson been aware of this fact, he would not have said that the Choregus <lb/>
            had nothing to do with the dramatic performers; nor would he have said that, had <lb/>
            the actors been paid by the Choregus, the dramatic choruses would have been the <lb/>
            most expensive; still less would he have supposed that the actors were paid by the <lb/>
            dramatists, had he remembered that plays were frequently acted after the death of <lb/>
            the authors; nor would he have fancied they were paid by the state, had he <lb/>
            thoroughly understood the celebrated comparison made by Demosthenes between <lb/>
            himself and his rival, ' You was an actor: I paid the chorus-master, and therefore <lb/>
            your fellow-actors.' For be it remembered that Æschines was a third-rate per­ <lb/>
            former, and not merely one of the corps de ballet; and had he been paid by the <lb/>
            state, his profession would have been rather an honour than the reverse." </note><note type="footnote"> Of the same opinion as to the last point is F. A. Wolf: Prolegomena in Orate <lb/>
            Lept. 91: </note><note type="footnote"> " Nihil dubitandum, quin ejusdem qui choris scenicis sumptum suggereret com­ <lb/>

            who, while he was under training in his house, had taken some poison to improve <lb/>
            his voice. </note> <note type="footnote"> R 2 </note> <lb/>

            prizes for the best performance; but the cost of these also was defrayed <lb/>
            by the victor. Every such tripod was inscribed with the name of <lb/>
            the successful Choragus and his tribe, and preserved as a memorial <lb/>
            in a chapel near the theatre. In course of time so many of these <lb/>
            chapels were erected, that they formed a row or street, called the <lb/>
            Street of Tripods, leading from the theatre in a north-easterly direc­ <lb/>
            tion to the Acropolis.1</p>
          <p>II. The Gymnasiarch was an officer appointed by each of the tribes <lb/>
            to superintend the Gymnasia, or gymnastic schools, where the youth <lb/>
            of Athens received that training which imparted health and vigour <lb/>
            to their bodies. By the laws of Solon considerable powers were <lb/>
            vested in these officers, not only to enforce performance of the pre­ <lb/>
            scribed exercises, but also to preserve decorum and good behaviour, <lb/>
            to prevent improper persons from intruding into the schools, and to <lb/>
            guard the youths from the corruption of evil company.2 In later <note type="footnote"> (1) Pausanias, i. 20. The Prytaneum mentioned in this passage is that of later <lb/>
            times. Christopher Wordiworth thus writes, in his Athens and Attica, page 153: </note><note type="footnote"> " The line of similar fabrics, of which the small circular building of the most <lb/>
            graceful Corinthian proportions, called the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates, is the <lb/>
            only surviving relic, must have possessed great interest, both from their object and <lb/>
            execution. They were a series of temples forming a street. These temples were <lb/>
            surmounted by finials which supported the tripods gained by victorious Choragi in <lb/>
            the neighbouring theatre of Bacchus, and here dedicated by them to that deity, the <lb/>
            patron of dramatic representations. From the inscriptions engraved on the archi­ <lb/>
            traves of these temples, which recorded the names of the victorious parties, and the <lb/>
            year in which the victory was gained, the dramatic chronicles or didascaliæ were <lb/>
            mainly compiled. Thus these small fabrics served the purposes at the same time <lb/>
            of fasti, trophies, and temples. What a host of soul-stirring thoughts must have <lb/>
            started up in the mind of a sensitive Athenian, as he walked along this street!" </note><note type="footnote"> (2) See the Oration of Æschines against Timarchus (p. 2), where these regulations <lb/>
            are minutely described. On the subject of the Gymnasia and Palæstræ full <lb/>
            information may be obtained in Becker's Charicles, Excursus to Scene V. On the <lb/>
            abuses of the Gymnasia he remarks as follows (Transl. p. 293): </note><note type="footnote"> " Of all the peculiar Hellenistic institutions the Gymnasia are perhaps the most <lb/>
            important, for none exercised so powerful an influence on the entire development <lb/>
            and various phases of Greek life-none at once awakened the noblest feelings, and <lb/>
            fostered the most impure passions-none formed to the same extent the incitement <lb/>
            to glorious deeds and the seduction to idle pastimes-none so much enhanced the <lb/>
            vigour of the corporeal powers, and at the same time gave them so false a direction <lb/>
            -none made them so alive to the beauty and nobility of the human form, and opened <lb/>
            so broad a field for the grandest creations of art-and lastly, none betrayed youthful <lb/>
            innocence into such degrading abuses—as was the case with the exercises of the <lb/>
            Gymnasia. . . . . We cannot wonder that the stern Romans, who valued such <lb/>
            exercises merely for their military and diætetic advantages, judged unfavourably of <lb/>
            Grecian gymnastics... that they induced inactivity and idleness; that what should <lb/>
            have been the main objects, the strengthening and exercising the body, were <lb/>
            lost sight of; that instead of the use of weapons, mere unprofitable arts were <lb/>
            taught; and that the body was too highly fed on unnatural diet to become fitted for <lb/>
            other exertions. Many voices even in Greece itself re-echoed this imputation, in <lb/>
            which, it must be confessed, there is a good deal of truth, especially as respects the <lb/>
            athletes, the whole business of whose lives was the exercises of the Palæstra. At <lb/>
            Sparta, for instance, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πυγμὴ</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">παγκράτιον</foreign> were entirely prohibited. There also <lb/>
            athletics were not generally the object of gymnastics." </note><note type="footnote"> On the difference between the Gymnasium and the Palæstra he observes : </note><note type="footnote"> " The Gymnasium was a place including grounds for running, archery, javelin­ <lb/>
            practice, and the like, along with baths, and numerous resorts for those who only <lb/>
            sought amusement; while the Palæstra, on the other hand, was the regular wrestling <lb/>

            times such matters were less attended to, though other duties, which <lb/>
            ministered to the pleasures of the people, continued to be punctually <lb/>
            discharged. For the Gymnasiarch had to provide for the gymnastic <lb/>
            games, which were celebrated at divers of the Athenian festivals. He <lb/>
            trained the runners, wrestlers, and other athletes, whom he generally <lb/>
            chose from the best pupils of the gymnasium: he fitted up the stadium <lb/>
            or other place of exhibition, and made all the necessary preparations <lb/>
            at his own cost.</p>
          <p>Among these games the most expensive was the Lampadephoria, <lb/>
            or running with the torch, in which the Athenians took great delight. <lb/>
            The torch was carried by a chain of runners placed at certain dis­ <lb/>
            tances ; each of whom handed it to the next in station, till it reached <lb/>
            the last. The prize was adjudged to that set of runners who carried <lb/>
            it unextinguished to the goal. Lucretius, in a line familiar to clas­ <lb/>
            sical readers, compares the transmission of the torch to the succession <lb/>
            of human generations:— <lb/>
            " Et quasi cursores vitai lampada tradunt."</p>
          <p>The principal occasions on which the Lampadephoria was cele­ <lb/>
            brated were the festivals of Prometheus, Vulcan, and Pallas. The <lb/>
            reason is obvious. Prometheus was the giver of fire to mortals; <lb/>
            Vulcan applied it to the forge; Pallas to other useful arts. The <lb/>
            runners started from the altar of the three deities in the Ceramicus, <lb/>
            and ran about half a mile to the Acropolis. There was also a torch- <lb/>
            race in honour of Pan, introduced after the battle of Marathon; and <lb/>
            another in honour of the Thracian Artemis, instituted in the time of <lb/>
            Socrates, when the race was for the first time performed on horse­ <lb/>
            back.</p>
          <p>HI. Feasting of the tribes was an obligation of not very frequent <lb/>
            occurrence. Some rich Athenian was selected to give a banquet to <lb/>
            his fellow-tribesmen. It was connected with sacred objects, and <lb/>
            served to keep up a friendly intercourse between the members of the <lb/>
            tribe.</p>
          <p>IV. The conduct of religious embassies,1 which the Athenians <lb/>
            sent to Delos, Delphi, or elsewhere, either to consult an oracle, or <lb/>
            to perform a sacrifice, or to attend the periodical meetings of the <lb/>
            Greeks, was entrusted to the more wealthy citizens, on whom the <lb/>
            greater part of the expense devolved, though a certain allowance was <lb/>
            made them by the state. These were not occasions for parsimony. <lb/>
            The envoy represented the city of Athens. It was for her honour <note type="footnote"> taught and practised. That the Palæstra was not necessarily a private institution <lb/>
            is clear from Xenophon, de Rep. Athen. ii. 9: <foreign xml:lang="grc">ό δὲ δη̃μος αὐτὸς αὑτψ̃ οἰκοδομει̃ται <lb/>
            ἰδιᾳ παλαίστρας πολλὰς, κ</foreign>. T. A. The distinction which Krause has attempted to <lb/>
            establish, that the <foreign xml:lang="grc">παλαίστρα</foreign> was chiefly for the use of boys, is quite untenable. <lb/>
            Æschines uses the words interchangeably; and Antiphon, de Cæd. Invol. p. 661, <lb/>
            speaking of boys only, has, <foreign xml:lang="grc">μελετω̃ν μετὰ τω̃ν ἡλίκων ἀκοντίζειν ἐπὶ τψ̃ γυμνασίψ</foreign>. <lb/>
            Confer Lucian, Navig. 4, where the young men betake themselves to the Palæstra. <lb/>
            When Solon forbade slaves both <foreign xml:lang="grc">γυμνάζεσθαι</foreign> and also <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξηραλοιφει̃ν ὲν ται̃ς παλαί­ <lb/>
            στραις</foreign>, all the kinds of gymnastic exercises are included." </note><note type="footnote"> (1) The conductor was called <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἀρχιθέωρος</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="246"/>
            that he should appear to advantage; and want of liberality was no <lb/>
            vice of an Athenian. Nicias, who conducted the embassy to Delos, <lb/>
            when the great Ionian festival was revived,1 expended a large sum of <lb/>
            money in order to make an appearance worthy of his country. Land­ <lb/>
            ing at Rhenea, which is separated by a narrow channel from Delos, <lb/>
            he laid across the strait a bridge which he had brought from Athens, <lb/>
            covered with ornaments of tapestry and gold: over this he marched in <lb/>
            grand procession, with a band of music, to the temple of Apollo. After <lb/>
            celebrating the games, he presented to the god a brazen palm-tree, <lb/>
            and gave ten thousand drachms for a piece of ground, which he <lb/>
            dedicated to the service of the temple, directing that the profits <lb/>
            should be laid out in an annual feast and sacrifice, at which the <lb/>
            Delians were to pray for the prosperity of the donor. Plutarch tells <lb/>
            us, the liberality of Nicias was remembered by the Delians in his <lb/>
            time.2</p>
          <p>But the greatest display of magnificence was that made by Alci­ <lb/>
            biades at the Olympic games shortly after the peace of Nicias: when <lb/>
            he entered seven chariots to contend in the race, and gained the first, <lb/>
            second, and fourth prizes; and afterwards gave a splendid feast to the <lb/>
            whole assembly of spectators. Singular honours were paid him on <lb/>
            this occasion by the subject-allies of Athens. The Ephesians pitched <lb/>
            for him a beautiful tent; the Chians furnished him with provender <lb/>
            for his horses and beasts for sacrifice; the Lesbians with wine and <lb/>
            provisions. Thucydides represents him as boasting of this display in <lb/>
            a speech to the Athenian assembly.3</p>
          <p>P. A. Wolf seems to be of opinion, that these compulsory services <lb/>
            were a great hardship on the better classes at Athens.4 They do not <lb/>
            appear however to have been complained of in the flourishing <lb/>
            period of the republic. All took the burden in turn; no man being <lb/>
            compellable to serve more than once in two years, nor more than one <lb/>
            office at a time. We find citizens frequently volunteering to defray <lb/>
            charges to which by law they were not liable, and incurring much <lb/>
            greater expenses than there was any necessity for. Nicias and <lb/>
            Alcibiades, while they exhibited a munificence which few could <lb/>
            imitate, are yet examples illustrating the general spirit of the age. <note type="footnote"> (1) In the sixth year of the Peloponnesian war. (Thucydides, iii. 104.) </note><note type="footnote"> This great Ionian meeting (<foreign xml:lang="grc">Πανήγυρις</foreign>) was quadriennial. There was a lesser <lb/>

            In times of distress, when not only the funds of the state but the <lb/>
            means of private citizens were exhausted, it became of course more <lb/>
            difficult to provide for the public amusements; and we cannot be <lb/>
            surprised, if men possessed of a little property were not inclined to <lb/>
            entertain their fellow-citizens at a great expense. Towards the close <lb/>
            of the Peloponnesian war, and for some time after, the choragic <lb/>
            service (like the trierarchal) was divided between two: but when <lb/>
            the people had recovered from their calamities, they reverted to the <lb/>
            ancient practice.</p>
          <p>The orators abound in allusions to these official services, both in <lb/>
            their political and in their forensic speeches. Liberality in discharging <lb/>
            them was a ready way of becoming popular. Therefore even in courts <lb/>
            of justice the parties, addressing a jury not unlike an assembly of the <lb/>
            people, claim credit to themselves and their friends for the readiness <lb/>
            with which they had undertaken the duties of choragus, &amp;c., and the <lb/>
            large sums of money which they had expended upon them, while they <lb/>
            reproach their adversaries with backwardness and illiberality in such <lb/>
            respects, and not unfrequently with concealing their property in order <lb/>
            to escape the burden. I shall present the reader with a few specimens <lb/>
            of this kind of argument, which will at the same time illustrate the <lb/>
            subject before us and exhibit the temper of an Athenian audience.</p>
          <p>The first is from the speech of Lysias, written for a client charged <lb/>
            with the offence of bribery:1</p>
          <p>" I came of age in the Archonship of Theopompus, and being ap­ <lb/>
            pointed Choragus for tragedy, I spent thirty minas, and three months <lb/>
            after I gained the prize at the Thargelian festival with a chorus of <lb/>
            men, and spent two thousand drachms. In the Archonship of Glau­ <lb/>
            cippus I laid out eight hundred drachms on a band of Pyrrhichists at <lb/>
            the great Panathenæa. Again, providing a chorus of men for the <lb/>
            Dionysian festival in the same year, I gained the prize, and spent <lb/>
            (including the dedication of the tripod) five thousand drachms; and <lb/>
            in the Archonship of Diodes at the lesser Panathenæa three hundred <lb/>
            for a Cyclic chorus. In the mean time I was Trierarch for seven <lb/>
            years, and expended six talents. And although I was making these <lb/>
            large outlays, and daily risking my life for you and remaining abroad, <lb/>
            I have nevertheless paid for property-tax first thirty minas and then <lb/>
            forty. As soon as I returned home, in the Archonship of Alexius, <lb/>
            I was Gymnasiarch for the Promethean festival, and I was victorious, <lb/>
            having laid out twelve minas: and afterwards I was appointed to <lb/>
            furnish a chorus of boys, and expended more than fifteen minas. In <lb/>
            the Archonship of Euclides I furnished a chorus of comedians for <lb/>
            Cephisodotus, and was the victor, and spent (including the dedication <lb/>
            of the ornaments) sixteen minas; and at the lesser Panathenæa I <lb/>
            furnished a Pyrrhic chorus of beardless boys and spent seven minas. <lb/>
            I have been victor with my trireme in a race off the coast of Sunium, <note type="footnote"> (1) Oration xxi. p. 161. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="248"/>
            when 1 spent fifteen minas. And besides I have conducted religious <lb/>
            embassies, and superintended the Arrhephoria1 and other services of <lb/>
            the like description, which have cost me upwards of thirty minas. <lb/>
            And of these sums which I have enumerated, had I chosen to perform <lb/>
            my service according to the letter of the law, I should not have <lb/>
            expended the fourth part.</p>
          <p>* * * * * * <lb/>
            " Having run so many hazards for your sake and conferred so <lb/>
            many benefits upon the commonwealth, I now ask, not (like other <lb/>
            men) to receive a recompense from you, but not to be deprived of my <lb/>
            own property, conceiving that it would be a disgrace to you to take <lb/>
            it from me either with or without my consent. And I care not so <lb/>
            much if I must lose my estate; but I cannot endure to be insulted, <lb/>
            or that people who evade the public charges should imagine, that, <lb/>
            while I am unrequited for what I have spent upon you, they are <lb/>
            thought to have acted wisely because they have thrown none of their <lb/>
            property away. If now you will hearken to me, you will at the same <lb/>
            time give a righteous verdict and adopt that course which is beneficial <lb/>
            to yourselves. You see, men of the jury, how scanty are the revenues <lb/>
            of the commonwealth, and how they are plundered by our leading <lb/>
            statesmen: so that you may well believe your surest revenue is the <lb/>
            substance of those who are willing to defray the public charges. If <lb/>
            then you are prudent, you will take as much care of my estate as you <lb/>
            would of your own private fortunes, knowing that you will have the <lb/>
            advantage of all that I possess the same as you had before. I think <lb/>
            you are all aware, that I shall be a much better manager of my own <lb/>
            finances than those who manage for you the finances of the common­ <lb/>
            wealth. Should you reduce me to poverty, you will injure yourselves <lb/>
            likewise; and other men will divide my effects among them, as they <lb/>
            have divided everything else."</p>
          <p>The next is from the Oration of Isæus on the Estate of Apollo­ <lb/>
            dorus, written for a person claiming as son by adoption against the <lb/>
            nearest of kin :2</p>
          <p>" I beseech you to give me redress both for the sake of Apollodorus <lb/>
            and for the sake of his father. You will find, they were not useless <lb/>
            citizens, but as zealous as they could be in your service. His father, <lb/>
            besides having served all the other burdensome offices, continued his <lb/>
            whole time to do the duty of Trierarch; not getting his ship in an <lb/>
            association like men of the present day, but at his own cost; not <lb/>
            Jointly with another, but singly; not every other year, but without <note type="footnote"> (1) This was a festival, celebrated in the month of Scirophorion, in honour of <lb/>
            Pallas: in which the principal ceremony was the carrying of some sacred vessels by <lb/>
            young girls chosen for the occasion from the best Athenian families. Some derive the <lb/>
            name <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπὸ του̃ τὰ ἄρ́ρ́ητα φορει̃ν</foreign>, because the contents of these vessels were kept <lb/>
            a mystery. Others say that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀῤῥηφόρια</foreign> is only another form of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐῤῥηφόρια</foreign>, or <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐρσηφόρια</foreign>, and derive it from Erse, the daughter of Cecrops, whose worship was <lb/>
            associated with that of Pallas. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) Oration vii. p. 67. </note> <lb/>

            intermission; not in a shabby way,' but providing the best possible <lb/>
            equipments. For which you not only honoured him in remembrance <lb/>
            of his conduct, but prevented his son being deprived of his property, <lb/>
            and compelled the parties in possession to restore what belonged to <lb/>
            him. Apollodorus himself did not (like Pronapes) return a small <lb/>
            capital, but was assessed as a knight and deemed himself worthy to <lb/>
            hold magistracies: he was not one who sought to usurp the property <lb/>
            of others without choosing to do any good to you, but exhibiting <lb/>
            openly before you all that he possessed, he zealously performed what­ <lb/>
            ever you required of him, and without doing any wrong endeavoured <lb/>
            to live liberally on his own means, content to spend a moderate por­ <lb/>
            tion on himself, while he preserved the rest for the commonwealth, <lb/>
            that it might be sufficient for the public charges. And out of this <lb/>
            what office of burden did he not satisfactorily discharge ? What rate <lb/>
            was he not among the first to pay ? What duty has he omitted ? <lb/>
            He gained the prize also for a chorus of boys, and that tripod stands <lb/>
            as a memorial of his liberality. But what ought a respectable citizen <lb/>
            to have done ? Ought he not, where other men were grasping at <lb/>
            what did not belong to them, to have abstained from such conduct, <lb/>
            and endeavoured to have preserved his own ? Ought he not, where <lb/>
            the state requires money, to be among the first to contribute, and <lb/>
            conceal none of his effects ? Well then: such a man was he: and it <lb/>
            will be just that you should make him this requital, giving effect to <lb/>
            his intention concerning his own property. You will find that I also <lb/>
            have been, considering my age, not a bad or a useless citizen. I have <lb/>
            served the state in her. campaigns: I perform what is required of me: <lb/>
            that is the duty of people at my age. You ought then, both for their <lb/>
            sakes and mine, to have regard for my interests; especially as my <lb/>
            adversaries have wasted and sold and destroyed a trierarchal estate <lb/>
            of five talents, whilst I have both already performed the official <lb/>
            services, and shall continue to do so, if you will effectuate the inten­ <lb/>
            tion of Apollodorus by restoring to me this estate."</p>
          <p>In a style very similar to this is the reasoning of Demosthenes in <lb/>
            the Oration against Aphobus : 2 in the composition of which, we may <lb/>
            remember, he is said to have been assisted by his master Isæus: <note type="footnote"> (1) '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αφοσιούμενος</foreign> : "Doing no more than the law absolutely required: barely <lb/>
            performing his duty: that is, doing it in a mean and shabby way." </note><note type="footnote"> (2) Contra Aphobum, B. 842. And see the Oration against Midias, ante, p.l 16, &amp;c. <lb/>
            in the same way the Roman Ædiles endeavoured to gain popularity by magnificent <lb/>
            shows. Cicero thus remarks on the practice in his second book De Officiis, s. 16 : </note><note type="footnote"> "Omnino duo aunt genera largorum: quorum alter! prodigi, alteri liberales. <lb/>
            Prodigi, qui epulis et viscerationibus et gladiatorum muneribus, ludorum venatio­ <lb/>
            numque apparatu, pecunias profundunt in eas res, quarum memoriam aut brevem, <lb/>
            aut nullam omnino sint relicturi. Liberales autem, qui sub facultatibus aut captos <lb/>

          <p>" It is not proper, men of the jury, either that I should be refused <lb/>
            redress, or that my opponent should retain the wealth he has plun­ <lb/>
            dered. With regard to myself, though you have no actual experience <lb/>
            of my disposition towards you, it is fair to presume that I shall not <lb/>
            be worse than my father. Of the defendant you have some experience; <lb/>
            and you well know that, although he has inherited a large fortune, <lb/>
            he has not only shown no liberality to the public, but even grasps at <lb/>
            the property of his neighbour. Bear in mind this, with the other <lb/>
            facts of the case, and give your votes according to justice. You have <lb/>

            my interests; seeing that, if I recover my rights by your assistance, <lb/>
            I shall naturally be grateful to you for restoring them, and glad to <lb/>
            defray the public charges; whereas the defendant, if you let him keep <lb/>
            what belongs to me, will do nothing of the kind: for do not suppose, <lb/>
            that he will choose to contribute in respect of property which he <lb/>
            denies having received: no: he will rather conceal it, to justify the <lb/>
            verdict in his favour."</p>
          <p>It remains to notice the services imposed on the aliens who resided <lb/>
            at Athens. It appears, they were liable to perform the Choragia at <lb/>
            the Lenæan festival, where the actors were allowed to be foreigners; <lb/>
            and occasionally to entertain the tribesmen at a banquet. There were <lb/>
            also certain duties of a less honourable but not very burdensome <lb/>
            nature, which were intended to remind them of their inferior and <lb/>
            dependent position. These were the Hydriaphoria and Sciadephoria : <lb/>
            the first of which was performed by their wives, who carried vessels <lb/>
            of water before the wives of citizens, when they walked in procession <lb/>
            at the Panathenæa ; the second by their daughters, who held parasols <lb/>
            before the Athenian maidens on the same occasion. <note type="footnote"> pauca posui, multo et major videtur et certior. Quanto Aristoteles gravius et verius <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>A LARGE number of foreigners took up their abode permanently at <lb/>
            Athens, some of whom were exiles driven from their native countries <lb/>
            by war or revolution or domestic calamity; many were attracted by <lb/>
            the beauty and pleasantness of the city,by the charms of Athenian <lb/>
            society and the liberality of the people; by the opportunities which <lb/>
            it afforded for instruction, or by its advantages for carrying on mer­ <lb/>
            cantile business. In the best times of the republic it is calculated <lb/>
            that there were forty or fifty thousand aliens dwelling at Athens, <lb/>
            including women and children. They were principally of Greek race, <lb/>
            but not entirely: some were freedmen, or the descendants of freed­ <lb/>
            men, who had been brought to Athens in servitude from Asia Minor <lb/>
            or other countries, and having afterwards been liberated by their <lb/>
            masters, were ranked in the class of domiciliated aliens. All were <lb/>
            under the protection of the Polemarch.</p>
          <p>Whilst they were treated on the whole with great liberality, they <lb/>
            were not considered as forming a part of the state, or as entitled to <lb/>
            any of the privileges of citizens. Not only were they excluded from <lb/>
            exercising political rights, such as voting, sitting onjuries, and the <lb/>
            like but they could not even plead their own causes in courts of <lb/>
            justice, or transact any legal business by themselves, whether of a <lb/>
            public or a private nature; for such purpose each of them was obliged <lb/>
            to have a citizen for his Prostates1 or Patron, who performed all neces­ <lb/>
            sary functions on his behalf, and was responsible for his good conduct. <lb/>
            It was of great importance to have a respectable Patron, and the <lb/>
            alien's own position very much depended upon it.2 A freedman's <lb/>
            Patron was his former master, to whom, though free, he still owed <lb/>
            certain duties of respect and acknowledgment, for the neglecting of <lb/>
            which he might be sued at law.3 <note type="footnote"> (1) He was said <foreign xml:lang="grc">προστάτην ἐπιγράψασθαι</foreign>, to choose a patron; whose name was of <lb/>

              An alien could not contract a legal marriage with a citizen. Nor <lb/>
              could he acquire any landed property by law. And therefore aliens <lb/>
              lived mostly in lodging-houses,1 the letting of which was a profitable <lb/>
              speculation for wealthy citizens. A large number of them were in <lb/>
              the Piræus, where the aliens chiefly resided for the convenience of <lb/>
              trade and commerce. Xenophon recommended that the resident aliens, <lb/>
              or at least the most respectable of them, should have permission to <lb/>
              become house-proprietors, and be encouraged to build houses and <lb/>
              invest their money in them.2</p>
          <p>In return for the protection afforded them, each head of a family <lb/>
            paid a yearly tax of twelve drachms; a widow paid only six; and <lb/>
            a freedman three obols in addition. Any one refusing to pay the <lb/>
            tax, or assuming the rank of a citizen, was liable to be prosecuted, <lb/>
            and on conviction sold as a slave. a</p>
          <p>Aliens were liable to the property-tax, and formed into a distinct <lb/>
            board for that purpose. As they could not be landowners, they were <lb/>
            rated for personal property only, and perhaps for that very reason <lb/>
            they were assessed at a higher rate than the citizens,4 and doubtless <lb/>
            were subject to a stricter inquisition in order to discover the real <lb/>
            value of their estates. Of the offices which they were called upon <lb/>
            to serve I have spoken in the last Appendix. Frequent mention is <lb/>
            made by the historians of their employment in the fleets and armies. <lb/>
            This duty does not appear to have been regular, but imposed as <lb/>
            occasion required. 5</p>
          <p>The son of an alien born in Athens did not thereby become a citizen, <lb/>
            nor had he any different status from his father. Citizenship depended <lb/>
            not on the place of birth, but on parentage. It could only be con­ <lb/>
            ferred by the votes of two consecutive popular assemblies, in the <lb/>
            last of which six thousand votes must have been given by ballot. In <lb/>
            times of war and calamity, when great sacrifices became necessary, <lb/>
            large creations of citizens took place; as after the battle of Chæronea. <lb/>
            At other times citizenship was only granted for some extraordinary <lb/>
            merit. It was much more common however to confer upon an alien <lb/>
            the rank of Isoteles, which, as the title imports, put him on an equal <lb/>
            footing with citizens in regard to taxes, including exemption from <lb/>
            the annual tribute, and dispensed with the necessity of his having <lb/>
            a Patron. He was then permitted also to hold land and houses, and <lb/>
            to work the mines. There were some further privileges attached to <lb/>
            the position of an Isoteles, which are not exactly known. The better <lb/>
            opinion is, that he was not eligible to magisterial offices, nor had the <lb/>
            right of voting or sitting on juries, nor was registered as a member <lb/>
            of any township. It appears however that he was capable of being <note type="footnote"> (1) Called <foreign xml:lang="grc">συνοικίαι</foreign>. See my article under that title in the Archaeological Dic­ <lb/>

            an Arbitrator. 1 On account of his holding this middle rank between <lb/>
            a citizen and an alien, I have in my translation called the Isoteles <lb/>
            a denizen. 2</p>
          <p>The trade of Athens fell a good deal into the hands of the resident <lb/>
            aliens, owing in some measure to that feeling from which even Athe­ <lb/>
            nian minds were not wholly free, and which prevailed more especially <lb/>
            among the higher classes-that trade was not respectable. We know <lb/>
            indeed that many citizens embarked large sums in mercantile specu­ <lb/>
            lations and money-lending: many possessed factories, and made con­ <lb/>
            siderable profit by them: for example, the father of Isocrates was <lb/>
            a flute-maker; the father of Demosthenes was a sword-cutler: but <lb/>
            their workmen in almost all cases were slaves, the master doing little <lb/>
            more than superintending the accounts and receiving the profits. At <lb/>
            all events the retail trade, together with a good portion of the rest, <lb/>
            was engrossed by the foreign settlers.3 <note type="footnote"> (1) See Schömann, de Comitiis, 81. Boekh's Public Economy of Athens, Transl. <lb/>
            ii. 316. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) Whose position is thus explained in Blackstone's Commentaries, i. 374: <lb/>
            " A denizen is an alien born, but who has obtained ex donatione regis letters patent <lb/>
            to make him an English subject; a high and incommunicable branch of the royal <lb/>
            prerogative. A denizen is in a kind of middle state, between an alien and natural <lb/>
            born subject, and partakes of both of them. He may take lands by purchase or <lb/>
            devise, which an alien may not; but cannot take by inheritance: for his parent, <lb/>
            through whom he must claim, being an alien, had no inheritable blood, and there­ <lb/>
            fore could convey none to the son. And, upon a like defect of hereditary blood, the <lb/>
            issue of a denizen, born before denization, cannot inherit to him; but his issue born <lb/>
            after may. A denizen is not excused from paying the alien's duty and some other <lb/>
            mercantile burdens. And no denizen can be of the privy council or either house <lb/>
            of parliament or have any office of trust, civil or military, or be capable of any <lb/>
            grant of lands, &amp;c. from the crown. Naturalization cannot be performed but by act <lb/>
            of parliament; for by this an alien is put in exactly the same state as if he had been <lb/>
            born in the king's. ligeance." </note><note type="footnote"> (3) Grote in his History of Greece (iii. 182), speaking of Solon's regulations for <lb/>
            the encouragement of trade, says : </note><note type="footnote"> " Nor ought we to pass over this early manifestation in Attica of an opinion <lb/>
            equitable and tolerant towards sedentary industry, which in most other parts of <lb/>
            Greece was regarded as comparatively dishonourable. The general tone of Grecian <lb/>
            sentiment recognised no occupations as perfectly worthy of a free citizen, except <lb/>
            arms, agriculture, and athletic and musical exercises; and the proceedings of the <lb/>
            Spartans, who kept aloof even from agriculture, and left it to their Helots, were <lb/>
            admired, though they could not be copied, throughout most part of the Hellenic <lb/>
            world. Even minds like Plato, Aristotle, and Xenophon concurred to a considerable <lb/>
            extent in this feeling, which they justified on the ground that the sedentary life and <lb/>
            unceasing housework of the artisan was inconsistent with military aptitude. The <lb/>
            town occupations are usually described by a word which carries with it contemptuous <lb/>
            ideas, and, though recognised as indispensable to the existence of the city, are held <lb/>
            suitable only for an inferior and semi-privileged order of citizens. This, the received <lb/>
            sentiment among Greeks as well as foreigners, found a strong and growing oppo­ <lb/>
            sition at Athens, corroborated also by a similar feeling at Corinth. The trade of <lb/>
            Corinth, as well as of Chalcis in Eubœa, was extensive at a time when that of Athens <lb/>
            had scarce any existence ; but, while the despotism of Periander can hardly have <lb/>
            failed to operate as a discouragement to industry at Corinth, the contemporaneous <lb/>
            legislation of Solon provided for traders and artisans a new home at Athens, giving <lb/>
            the first encouragement to that numerous town population both in the city and in <lb/>
            the Piræus, which we find actually residing there In the succeeding century. The <lb/>
            multiplication of these town residents, both citizens and metics, was a capital fact <lb/>
            in the onward march of Athens, since it determined not merely the extension of her <lb/>
            trade, but also the preeminence of her naval force, and thus, as a farther consequence, <lb/>
            lent extraordinary vigour to her democratical government." [He </note> <pb n="254"/>
            </p>
          <p>That their condition at Athens was on the whole pleasant and <lb/>
            comfortable, is apparent from the numbers residing there: and that <lb/>
            many of them grew rich and prosperous, is abundantly testified. <lb/>
            The orators Lysias and Dinarchus prove by their examples, that <lb/>
            fame as well as fortune might be won by an enterprising stranger. <lb/>
            The father of Lysias was a Syracusan named Cephalus, who came <lb/>
            to Athens at the invitation of Pericles. Lysias himself was born <lb/>
            at Athens, and lived there for fifteen years, after which he went with <lb/>
            a body of Athenian colonists to settle at Thurii in Italy. In that <lb/>
            city he remained till the age of forty-seven, when he and many others <lb/>
            were expelled by a Spartan party, which had got the upper hand <lb/>
            since the defeat of the Athenians in Sicily. He then returned to <lb/>
            Athens, where he dwelt for the remainder of his life, with the excep­ <lb/>
            tion of a short absence during the reign of the Thirty. His life had <lb/>
            nearly fallen a sacrifice to the rapacity of the tyrants, who for the <lb/>
            purpose of extorting money accused him, together with divers others <lb/>
            of his class, of disaffection to the government. His brother Pole­ <lb/>
            marchus was put to death. He himself, having with difficulty <lb/>
            escaped from prison, fled to Megara; and afterwards assisted <lb/>
            Thrasybulus with a supply of arms and men. For this, when the <lb/>
            democracy was restored, he obtained a grant of citizenship; which <lb/>
            was afterwards declared void on account of an irregularity, because <lb/>
            it had not been founded on a Probouleuma, or previous resolution <lb/>
            of the Council. He retained however the rank of an Isoteles, and <lb/>
            devoting himself for many years to the business of teaching rhetoric <lb/>
            and composing speeches and pleadings, he realized a considerable <lb/>
            fortune, and died at the age of eighty.</p>
          <p>Dinarchus was born at Corinth, and having come to Athens in his <lb/>
            youth, carried on the same lucrative practice that Lysias did, of <lb/>
            a teacher and speech-writer. He left behind him a great number <lb/>
            of orations, of which the most celebrated was composed for the <lb/>
            prosecution of Demosthenes. This and two others are still extant. <note type="footnote"> He adds in a note, " The unbounded derision, however, which Aristophanes heaps <lb/>
            upon Cleon as a tanner, and upon Hyperbolus as a lamp-maker, proves, that if any <lb/>
            manufacturer engaged in politics, his party opponents found enough of the old sen­ <lb/>
            timent remaining to turn it to good account against him." </note><note type="footnote"> See the remarks in Becker's Charicles, Transl. p. 281. </note> <pb n="255"/>

          <ab>
            <title type="sub">THE ARCHONS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THE word Archon signifies ruler. According to the Attic legend, <lb/>
            after Codrus had bravely sacrificed his life for his country, the <lb/>
            Athenians determined, in honour to his memory, that no one in <lb/>
            future should bear the title of king. As Justin says:1 Post <lb/>
            Codrum nemo Athenis regnavit ; quod memorise nominis ejus tributum <lb/>
            est." His successors were called Archons; and under that title they <lb/>
            continued for about twelve generations to hold the chief magistracy <lb/>
            for life. The office was then limited in duration to ten years : and <lb/>
            some time afterwards the power of government passed from the <lb/>
            regnant house into the hands of the Eupatridæ or Nobles; the office <lb/>
            of Archon became annual, and was distributed among nine persons <lb/>
            chosen from the noble families. It is only of these annual Archons <lb/>
            that we know anything from authentic history. The name of the <lb/>
            chief marked the year of his office, and was entered in all the <lb/>
            registers and public documents to which a date had to be assigned. <lb/>
            Hence he was called Eponymus. Of these we have a regular and <lb/>
            unbroken series from the year B.C. 683.</p>
          <p>Solon deprived the nobles of their exclusive title to this high <lb/>
            magistracy, substituting a property qualification for one of birth. <lb/>
            Under his law the Archons were chosen by the suffrages of the <lb/>
            people from the first of the four classes, Pentacosiomedimni: they <lb/>
            underwent a previous examination, to insure their fitness for office: <lb/>
            and at the close of their official year they were accountable to the <lb/>
            popular assembly. Further, in the first assembly of every Prytany <lb/>
            an opportunity was afforded to the people of passing votes of <lb/>
            approval or censure upon the conduct of the Archons, as well as <lb/>
            other magistrates ; 2 and those who had misbehaved themselves might <lb/>
            be deposed. So things continued until after the battle of Platæa, <lb/>
            When Aristides passed a law throwing open the office of Archon to <lb/>
            all the citizens: and about the same time, or soon after,3 another <lb/>
            change was introduced in favour of the lower classes, viz. election by <lb/>
            lot, instead of election by suffrage. The natural tendency of the last <lb/>
            measure was to raise men of inferior ability to the post of Archons: <note type="footnote"> (1) Justin, it 7.

            but this was of less consequence at the time when the change took <lb/>
            place; for, as we shall see, the importance of these functionaries had <lb/>
            greatly diminished.</p>
          <p>The Archons succeeded originally to the various powers-executive, <lb/>
            priestly, and judicial-which had been vested in the kings. These <lb/>
            at first were exercised by all in common; afterwards they were dis­ <lb/>
            tributed among the nine: still the Archons, in one way or other, <lb/>
            continued, down to the era of Solon's legislation, to engross the <lb/>
            administrative duties of the state.1 The reforms of Solon nowever, <lb/>
            followed by those of Clisthenes, effected—not all at once, but in <lb/>
            course of time, as the democratic principle gradually unfolded itself­ <lb/>
            a complete revolution: by which the power of the Archons was in <lb/>
            some cases taken away, in others immensely abridged. Thus, a <lb/>
            large portion of the executive administration, which had formerly <lb/>
            belonged to them, was given to the Council of Five-hundred. The <lb/>
            creation of the ten generals by Clisthenes virtually transferred to <lb/>
            them the whole of the military command, which Solon had left with <lb/>
            the Polemarch. And the judicial authority of the Archons, which <lb/>
            was anciently absolute and supreme, became ancillary only to that <lb/>
            of the Heliastic tribunal or jury, taken from the body of the people.2 <lb/>
            In short, during the flourishing days of the republic, the Archons <lb/>
            held places of dignity rather than power; and most of their duties <lb/>
            were matter of routine. The following account of them has reference <lb/>
            to this period.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">THE CHIEF ARCHON:</title>
          </ab>
          <p>The first or chief of the nine in point of dignity is called the <lb/>
            Archon always by ancient writers; while the grammarians call him <lb/>
            the Archon Eponymus. He had jurisdiction over all questions <lb/>
            arising out of family relations, such as those of husband to wife, <lb/>
            parent to child, &amp;c., and was bound specially to guard the interests <lb/>
            of those members of the family who needed protection, for example, <lb/>
            widows, orphans, heiresses. He had cognizance of suits for divorce, <lb/>
            alimony, and dower; complaints for ill-treatment of parents by <lb/>
            children, or women by their husbands, frauds committed by guardians <lb/>
            on their wards; writs of lunacy; indictments for idleness or waste of <lb/>
            patrimony.3</p>
          <p>Questions concerning inheritances came before him. It was his <note type="footnote"> (1) Thucydides, i. 126, speaking of the time of Cylon's conspiracy, says: <foreign xml:lang="grc">τότε δὲ</foreign> <lb/>

            gave an appeal from the Archon to the people. When the Jury-courts were esta­ <lb/>
            blished, the causes were carried to them for final hearing. The Archon gave his <lb/>
            opinion on the case, when it was brought before him; but the parties generally <lb/>
            insisted upon having a trial by jury, and it became dangerous for the Archon to <lb/>
            refuse it. (See Appendix IX. Grote's History of Greece, iii. 172. Meier &amp; Schömann, <lb/>
            Att. Proc. Einleit. 13.) </note><note type="footnote"> (3) The legal names of these suits or proceedings were <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπολείψεως, ἀποπέμψεως</foreign>, </note> <figure type="illustration">

              business, on receiving a claim to the estate of a deceased person, <lb/>
              to make proclamation of it in the next regular assembly, so that, if <lb/>
              there were any more claimants, they might come before him within <lb/>
              a given time: and when the title was contested, he put the case <lb/>
              in a proper train for legal decision. He sat in his office (which <lb/>
              was in the market-place by the statues of the ten heroes) every <lb/>
              month of the year except the last, to receive the applications of <lb/>
              suitors.1</p>
          <p>When a daughter became the representative of her deceased <lb/>
            father's house, the nearest male relative had a right to claim her in <lb/>
            marriage, and it was the Archon's business to assign her to the <lb/>
            proper person. If the right to her hand were disputed (as in the <lb/>
            case of a rich heiress was not uncommon), he brought the question <lb/>
            to trial. If she were poor, he had to see that the next of kin either <lb/>
            married her or gave her a suitable portion.2</p>
          <p>If a contest arose respecting a slave-whether he was or was not <lb/>
            entitled to be free-the proceedings were taken before the Archon, <lb/>
            on the one hand to assert his freedom, or on the other, to restore him <lb/>
            to his master.3</p>
          <p>The Archon superintended the election of the generals and military <lb/>
            officers. 4 He presided also at the celebration of the Great Dionysia <lb/>
            and the Thargelia. If a dramatic author required a chorus, the <lb/>
            Archon assigned him one. He heard the disputes between the <lb/>
            different choirmasters, whether on the subject of their liability to <lb/>
            serve the office, or on matters concerning the performance. Meier <lb/>
            and Schömann think, that he brought into court those cases of <lb/>
            Probole, which arose out of the festivals which he presided over.5</p>
          <p>The reader will here bear in mind, though I shall more fully <lb/>
            explain it in Appendix X., that in all the above-mentioned cases <lb/>
            where the Archon had a jurisdiction, (and the same remark applies <lb/>
            to his colleagues,) he was the directing and presiding magistrate <lb/>
            rather than the judge. He received the complaint, heard the parties <lb/>
            in the first instance, prepared the case for trial, and in due time (if <lb/>
            it was not otherwise settled) brought it for trial before a jury-court. <lb/>
            The jury was the tribunal which ultimately decided every question <lb/>
            both of law and fact, and awarded the damages or the punishment. <lb/>
            The powers of the Archon related to matters of form, and practically <lb/>
            did not extend beyond the imposition of a small fine. <note type="footnote"> (1) See all this fully explained by me under title Here, in the Archaeological <lb/>

            <title type="sub">THE KING-ARCHON.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>The second of the Archons received this name, because the <lb/>
            religious part of the kingly office was preserved mainly in his <lb/>
            person; and therefore he presided over some of the most ancient <lb/>
            and solemn festivals, as the Lensæa, the Eleusinian mysteries, the <lb/>
            Lampadephoria. His wife was called queen, and, as she had to <lb/>
            officiate at some important sacrifices, she was required to be of pure <lb/>
            Attic blood like himself, and married a virgin.1 He exercised juris­ <lb/>
            diction over all cases of murder and homicide; (for by them the city <lb/>
            was polluted, and he, as guardian of religion, had to see that the <lb/>
            pollution was duly expiated:) likewise cases of malicious wounding <lb/>
            or attempt to murder, poisoning, procuring of abortion, and arson. 2 <lb/>
            All these he brought before the Areopagus or such other court as <lb/>
            was appointed to try them. For a like reason he had cognizance <lb/>
            of all charges of impiety, and of disputes between different persons <lb/>
            or families concerning the right to any priesthood or the privileges <lb/>
            belonging to it.</p>
          <p>The term impiety at Athens embraced a wide range of crime, and <lb/>
            as the law was not capable of very exact definition, it was sometimes <lb/>
            made the vehicle of unjust persecution, as we know to have been the <lb/>
            case in modem times. Among the offences comprised under this title <lb/>
            were atheism and blasphemy, sacrilege, profanation of temples or <lb/>
            sacred property, neglect of prescribed ceremonials, divulgation of <lb/>
            mysteries. The charge against Socrates was-" that he did not <lb/>
            believe in the gods of his country, that he introduced the worship of <lb/>
            new divinities, and that he corrupted young men." The speech of <lb/>
            Andocides on the Mysteries is his own defence to a charge of having <lb/>
            profaned the mysteries of Eleusis. We have a speech of Lysias in <lb/>
            defence of a man accused of digging up a sacred olive-tree.3 Aristotle <lb/>
            was accused of impiety, in having composed a hymn in honour of <lb/>
            his friend Hermias and paid him divine honours. Doubtful of the <lb/>
            result, he fled from Athens, and said, in allusion to the fate of <lb/>
            Socrates, that he would not give the Athenians an opportunity of <lb/>
            sinning a second time against philosophy.</p>
          <p>The office of the King-Archon was in the King's Porch. 4</p>

          <p>He, as his name imports, was once commander-in-chief of the army. <lb/>
            When the ten generals were created, the right of joint command was <lb/>
            reserved to him; and in councils of war he had an equal voice with <lb/>
            all the ten; but this was soon changed, and his vote came to be <lb/>
            counted only for one. At Marathon the Polemarch Callimachus <note type="footnote"> (1) See especially Demosthenes, contr. Neser. 1370, and Lysias contr.

              voted for battle with Miltiades, and commanded the right wing or <lb/>
              the army. 1 But this was about the last occasion of any Polemarch <lb/>
              appearing at the head of the troops. He ceased from this time to <lb/>
              have any duties connected with war, except the superintendence of <lb/>
              some funeral games in honour of the slam: he became in short a <lb/>
              purely civil magistrate, his office being to overlook and protect the <lb/>
              aliens resident in the city. Even here indeed we trace the memory <lb/>
              of his ancient functions : for in early times, both among the Greeks <lb/>
              and the Romans, stranger and enemy were described by the same <lb/>
              name: hostis (says Cicero) 2 apud majores nostros is dicebatur quem <lb/>
              nunc peregrinum dicimus. In the advance of civilization, when <lb/>
              strangers came to be regarded with more humanity, and their rights <lb/>
              to be recognised by law, it was not surprising that they should be <lb/>
              placed under the care of a minister of war.</p>
          <p>The civil duties of the Polemarch have been compared to those of <lb/>
            the Prætor Peregrinus at Rome. He had the same jurisdiction over <lb/>
            the family rights of resident aliens, which the chief Archon exercised <lb/>
            over citizens. He received complaints against them for acting with­ <lb/>
            out a patron; and those preferred against freedmen for neglect of <lb/>
            duty to their former masters.3 In criminal proceedings against an <lb/>
            alien, which did not concern his personal status or his family rights, <lb/>
            the jurisdiction depended on the subject-matter of the charge.Pri­ <lb/>
            vate suits, in which an alien was defendant, were (with a very few <lb/>
            exceptions) heard before the Polemarch.</p>
          <p>He had an office in the Lyceum.4</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">THE ASSESSORS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Each of the three superior Archons nominated two Assessors <lb/>
            (Paredri), who assisted him with their counsel, and occasionally <lb/>
            acted as his deputies. Although removable by the person who <lb/>
            appointed them, the Assessors were themselves considered to hold <lb/>
            magisterial rank: they underwent an examination by the Council <lb/>
            before their appointment was ratified, and were liable at the end of <lb/>
            the year to render an account.5</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">THE THESMOTHETÆ OR JUDGES.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>The remaining six Archons, who bore this title, acted together as <lb/>
            a board, and had an extensive department of judicial duty assigned <lb/>
            to them. Hence indeed they received their name, which signifies <lb/>
            " makers of laws or ordinances:" a name by no means inappropriate <lb/>
            in ancient times, when the Archons heard and decided the causes <lb/>
            brought before them, without having codes or precedents to control <lb/>
            their judgment. Under such circumstances the person who decides <note type="footnote"> (1) Herodotus, vi. 109, 111. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) Cicero, de Officiis, i. 12. The Lacedæmonians called the Persians <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξένοι</foreign>. <lb/>

            the case in effect makes the law, and the judge and legislator are <lb/>
            one. Grote 1 observes, that strictly all the nine archons were <lb/>
            equally entitled to the name of Thesmothetæ Doubtless it was <lb/>
            given to the last six, because their jurisdiction was more extensive.</p>
          <p>Thus it appears, that no better translation could be found for <lb/>
            Thesmothetæ, than that of Judges, which I have chosen. True it is, <lb/>
            that other magistrates besides them superintended courts of justice. <lb/>
            But the same objection might be made to the application of the term <lb/>
            Judges in our own language; since, besides those who receive that <lb/>
            special designation, there are a multitude of commissioners, recorders, <lb/>
            magistrates, and others, who perform judicial duties.</p>
          <p>All judicial power having anciently been vested in the nine Archons, <lb/>
            the Thesmothetæ then had cognizance of all matters which were not <lb/>
            specially appropriated to the other three. In later times portions of <lb/>
            their jurisdiction were transferred to other functionaries, who either <lb/>
            were newly elected, or received an accession of authority; as the <lb/>
            Legistæ or Auditors, the Generals, the Eleven, the Forty, and others. <lb/>
            Still a very ample jurisdiction was left for these the Judges properly <lb/>
            so called; being, as Meier says, the remainder of all possible juris­ <lb/>
            diction, after subtracting what was specially given to other magis­ <lb/>
            trates. Among the various matters of which, either from ancient <lb/>
            authors or the testimony of grammarians, we know the Thesmothetæ <lb/>
            to have had cognizance, are the following-Charges against magis­ <lb/>
            trates on their probation 2 : informations for offences against the <lb/>
            mine-laws:3 most cases of Probole: appeals against townships for <lb/>
            ejecting members ; 4 indictments for pettifogging practices,5 for false <lb/>
            entries of debtors in the public register, 6 or false swearing to prove <lb/>
            a summons : 7 charges of theft, bribery, adultery, and personal out­ <lb/>
            rage.8—Also a great variety of civil actions; as those for the recovery <note type="footnote"> (1) Grote's History of Greece, ii. p. 99. </note><note type="footnote"> " According to the proper sense of the word Thesmothetæ, all the nine Archons <lb/>
            were entitled to be so called, though the first three had especial designations of <lb/>
            their own: the word Thesmoi (analogous to the Themistes. of Homer) includes in its <lb/>
            meaning both general laws and particular sentences-the two ideas not being yet <lb/>
            discriminated, and the general law being conceived only in its application to some <lb/>
            particular case. Draco was the first Thesmothet who was called upon to set down <lb/>
            his Thesmoi in writing, and thus to invest them essentially with a character of more <lb/>
            or less generality." </note><note type="footnote"> In a note he adds: </note><note type="footnote"> " Both Aristotle (Polit. ii. 9. 9.) and Demosthenes (contr. Everg. et Mnesibul. <lb/>

          <p>Connected with their character, as judges or ministers of the law, <lb/>
            was the duty, which we have seen was imposed on them, of annually <lb/>
            revising the whole body of statutes, and making a report thereon to <lb/>
            the peopled It was their business likewise to select the juries for <lb/>
            the different law-courts, and impanel them for trial. If Ulpian is to <lb/>
            be credited, they acted in some measure as conservators of the peace, <lb/>
            walking in the streets at night to prevent robbery.6</p>
          <p>They had an office called Thesmothesium in the market-place, <lb/>
            attached very likely to the Prytancum.7</p>
          <p>There were two cases in which all the nine Archons had jurisdic­ <lb/>
            tion in common: first, in the prosecution of deposed magistrates; <lb/>
            secondly, upon indictments for passing illegal measures.8</p>
          <p>The Archons were always regarded as being, in point of honour <lb/>
            and dignity, the chief magistrates of the state. They, as we have <lb/>
            seen, were exempted from the trierarchy; a privilege which no <lb/>
            other persons enjoyed by virtue of their station. While engaged in <lb/>
            official duty, they wore crowns of myrtle; and for any one to strike <lb/>
            or insult them at such a time was, as we learn from Demosthenes, a <lb/>
            high misdemeanor. At the end of the year, if their duties had been <lb/>
            properly discharged, they became members of the Areopagus.9</p>

              standard: whoever would judge them fairly, must thiow himself as <lb/>
              well as he can into the feelings of an ancient Athenian. It must not <lb/>
              be forgotten that practices wnich the laws of Solon condemned were <lb/>
              tolerated by the loose morals of the day: and even had this not been <lb/>
              so, the Athenians would have forgiven much to the memory of men, <lb/>
              whom they regarded as their deliverers from an odious tyranny. <lb/>
              Odious I say: for though,'at the time when the two friends raised <lb/>
              their steel against Hipparchus, neither that prince nor his brother <lb/>
              had behaved oppressively to the great body of the people, yet they <lb/>
              were in a position which enabled them to exercise what oppression <lb/>
              they pleased; and the very circumstances which led to the conspiracy <lb/>
              against them forcibly illustrated the danger of conceding to any man <lb/>
              a power above the laws. The words uttered two centuries after by <lb/>
              Hyperides, "we don't want a mild despot," express what in the <lb/>
              breast of an ancient Athenian was a deep sentiment of patriotism. <lb/>
              The tyrant or despot, however virtuous or humane he might be in his <lb/>
              private character, was still a man of lawless power and arbitrary <lb/>
              will, who could slay, imprison, or outrage any one he chose with <lb/>
              impunity. The only sure protection for life and property, for all that <lb/>
              a freeman held dear to him, was to live in a republic under equal <lb/>
              laws. So thought, so felt a good citizen of Athens from the days of <lb/>
              Solon to those of Demosthenes.</p>
          <p>Hippias, the eldest of the sons of Pisistratus, succeeded to his <lb/>
            father in the year B.C. 527. He was assisted in the government by <lb/>
            his brother Hipparchus; their administration was mild and equitable, <lb/>
            and even in accordance with the pre-established laws and institutions <lb/>
            of Athens, so far as was consistent with the maintenance of their own <lb/>
            authority. Hipparchus inherited the literary tastes of his father, <lb/>
            and was on intimate terms with the great poets of the day, Simonides <lb/>
            and Anacreon, the latter of whom he induced to visit Athens. The <lb/>
            author of the Platonic dialogue which bears his name commends <lb/>
            Hipparchus in exaggerated terms for his wisdom and virtue. He <lb/>
            was at least inspired with the ambition of being thought a moralist, <lb/>
            and he distributed about the city and public roads busts of Hermes, <lb/>
            which, while they answered a similar purpose to our milestones, <lb/>
            arrested the eye of the passenger with pithy and laconic apophthegms <lb/>
            in verse, such as, " Do not deceive your friend," " Persevere in affec­ <lb/>
            tion to justice;" and the like. Yet with all his affectation of <lb/>
            morality he was not the less addicted to sensual and unlawful <lb/>
            pleasures. He cast his eye upon Harmodius, a beautiful Athenian <lb/>
            youth, and affronted him with solicitations, which were indignantly <lb/>
            repelled. In revenge for this disdain, he put a public insult upon <lb/>
            the sister of the youth, summoning her to attend a religious proces­ <lb/>
            sion as one of the Canephoræ or basket-carriers, and, when she <lb/>
            presented herself, disavowing the summons, and scornfully rejecting <lb/>
            her as a person utterly unworthy of such an office. Meanwhile <lb/>
            Harmodius had informed his friend Aristogiton of the overtures <lb/>
             <pb n="263"/>
            which had been made to him, and excited in him a mingled feeling of <lb/>
            rage and fear; which was greatly increased when he heard of the <lb/>
            insult offered to the maiden. The two friends resolved upon <lb/>
            revenge, and extending their views beyond the mere satisfaction of <lb/>
            personal injury, concerted a plan, which they entrusted to a few select <lb/>
            associates, for killing both the brothers and putting an end to the <lb/>
            despotism. At the Panathenæan festival it was customary for the <lb/>
            citizens to march in arms to the Acropolis: this time, when their <lb/>
            appearance in arms would excite no suspicion, the conspirators <lb/>
            selected for their attempt. Harmodius and Aristogiton were pro­ <lb/>
            vided not only with spear and shield like the rest of the citizens, but <lb/>
            also with daggers concealed under the sacred myrtle boughs, which <lb/>
            were among the insignia of the procession. Their intention was first <lb/>
            to assail the elder tyrant. Advancing to the Ceramicus, where <lb/>
            Hippias was directing the order of the ceremonial, they perceived <lb/>
            him conversing familiarly with one of their own partisans, and con­ <lb/>
            jectured from his manner that their plot was betrayed. In the <lb/>
            confusion of the moment they renounced their attempt upon Hippias, <lb/>
            but resolving at all events to have their revenge, they hastened back <lb/>
            to the city, and meeting with Hipparchus, rushed upon him and <lb/>
            slew him. Harmodius himself was killed on the spot by the guards: <lb/>
            Aristogiton, escaping for the moment, was afterwards seized and <lb/>
            suffered a cruel death under the tortured The news of his brother's <lb/>
            death was speedily carried to Hippias, who took the promptest <lb/>
            means to crush the conspiracy before it had time to spread among <lb/>
            the crowd. Hastening to the spot where the citizens were assembled <lb/>
            for procession, with a calm demeanour, as if nothing had happened, <lb/>
            he ordered them to drop their arms and file off to another place which <lb/>
            he pointed out. His command being obeyed, the arms were seized <lb/>
            by his guards, and Hippias, arresting all on whose persons any con­ <lb/>
            cealed weapons were found, or whom he had any other cause to <lb/>
            distrust, secured himself against further danger.</p>
          <p>Such was the immediate termination of this famous conspiracy, <lb/>
            which happened in the thirteenth year of the reign of Hippias. <lb/>
            That prince, exasperated by the attempt which had been made <lb/>
            against him, from this time entirely changed his system of govern­ <lb/>
            ment, and from a mild and humane despot became a jealous and <lb/>
            cruel one. He reigned four years longer, until the Alcmæonidæ <lb/>
            with Spartan aid expelled him from Athens. The Athenian people, <lb/>
            established in a free commonwealth, regarded Harmodius and <lb/>
            Aristogiton as their deliverers; erected statues of them in the <lb/>
            Agora, 2 and granted those honours to their memory, and those immu­ <lb/>
            nities to their descendants, of which so much is said in the Orations <note type="footnote"> (1) Thucydides, vi. 58. The words <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ ὀᾳὸίως διετέθη</foreign> ambiguous perhaps in <lb/>
            themselves, are explained by later writers, who distinctly mention the torture. See <lb/>

            of Demosthenes, and in the Leptinea especially. In one sense un­ <lb/>
            doubtedly they were the liberators of Athens: for, though their attempt <lb/>
            failed, it drove Hippias into those measures which rendered him <lb/>
            universally odious, and produced the combination for his downfall. <lb/>
            But the popular belief went even beyond this; for in the course of <lb/>
            some years after the event, as we are assured by Thucydides, 1 it had <lb/>
            become a received tradition among the Athenian people, that <lb/>
            Hipparchus, not Hippias, was the elder brother, and that the dagger <lb/>
            which ended his life at the same time put an end to the dynasty of his <lb/>
            family. The story was taken up by the poets, and is embodied in the <lb/>
            famous Scolium or drinking-song of Callistratus, written about a <lb/>
            century after the event, which distinctly asserts that Harmodius and <lb/>
            Aristogiton "killed the tyrant Hipparchus," and that they " gave <lb/>
            equal laws to Athens."</p>

            which are collected and reviewed in Blackwood's Magazine, Vol. 33, <lb/>

            lowest of the people, was daily chanted—‘ Scolium Callistrati nescio <lb/>
            cujus, sed ingeniosi certe poetæ, et valde boni civis;' and, alluding <lb/>
            to the domination of Cæsar, he says that, had such a patriotic song <lb/>
            been familiar in the mouths. of the inhabitants of the Suburra, ' Plus <lb/>
            Mehercule valuisset unum Harmodii melos quam Cioeronis Philippicæ <lb/>
            omnes.' Is not that extravagant P It is spirit-reviving to sing aloud <lb/>
            Old songs that are the music of the heart; <lb/>
            and we have all heard of that saying of Fletcher of Saltoun—‘Let <lb/>
            others make the laws, give me the making of the songs of a country.' <lb/>
            But the power of the Pisistratidæ was not palsied merely, it was <lb/>
            dead and buried beyond all possibility of resurrection, long before <lb/>
            the singing of this famous Sodium. The elder Callistratus flourished <lb/>
            about a century after the assassination of Hipparchus; the younger <lb/>
            half a century later; and the youngest-for there are three spoken <lb/>
            of-about a hundred and fifty years only before the Christian era.</p><pb n="268"/>
            
          <p>" The song is a fine one, and was very popular-national; it struck <lb/>
            forcibly a single key that vibrated to the core of the people's heart. <lb/>
            Chanted by a manly voice, with accompaniment of suitable action, and <lb/>
            the singer like a hero at some festal entertainment, where all the guests <lb/>
            were full of wine and patriotism, the effect must have been magnificent, <lb/>
            and at its close sublime the muttered thunder of—‘Death to all <lb/>
            tyrants.' But on most occasions a little poetry will suffice to rouse <lb/>
            the imagination of a great assemblage to heights of noblest daring; <lb/>
            and there is but little poetry in this famous strain. It is of a higher <lb/>
            mood doubtless than our own King's Anthem; yet we remember the <lb/>
            time when loyalty was with us a national virtue and a national <lb/>
            passion, and when the voices of many hundreds of as noble men as <lb/>
            ever sat at an Athenian feast often shook the theatre in a transport <lb/>
            at these three no very august lines— <lb/>
            Send him victorious, <lb/>
            Happy and glorious, <lb/>
            Long to reign over us, <lb/>
            God save the King!</p>
          <p>" But let us take a critical glance at the translations. Our own is <lb/>
            a mere attempt to versify the original literally; and while we give it <lb/>
            as an example of the style in which the song should be translated, we <lb/>
            admit that it is poorly done, and nearly an entire failure. Cumber­ <lb/>
            land's is spirited, and it will be noticed that he supposes the song to <lb/>
            consist of but three stanzas. Denman's versions are both good; but <lb/>
            faulty as well in particular lines as in the general conception. Thus, <lb/>
            the second line of the first version, ' The sword that laid the tyrant <lb/>
            low,' is incorrect; that is asking the spectators and auditors to <lb/>
            believe too much, at least more than Calfistratus. The second line <lb/>
            of the second stanza is utter nonsense; ‘Thou ne'er shalt feel the <lb/>
            stroke of death.' Harmodius was killed on the spot. The song <lb/>
            says, ‘Thou art not dead ;’ nor was he, for he was in the Islands of <lb/>
            the Blest-but he had felt the stroke of death. The spirit of the <lb/>
            two following lines is destroyed by the use of the future tense— <lb/>
            ‘The heroes’happy isles shall be.' They were—<foreign xml:lang="grc">σε φασὶν εἴναι</foreign>—and <lb/>
            so believed all who lived under Minerva. ‘ While Freedom's name <lb/>
            is understood,' is poor, in comparison with <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀεὶ κατ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἶαν</foreign>, and the <lb/>
            song was not addressed formally to the 'wise and good,' of whom <lb/>
            there is no mention, because no thought, but to all who had ears to <lb/>
            hear the names of the deliverers. In the second version line second, <lb/>
            ‘noble and brave,' is but so so; 'the poets exultingly tell' is insurer. <lb/>
            able ; ' buried his pride in the grave' is vastly fine: all that about <lb/>
            Minerva is good in itself, but lugged in ad libitum; and ‘ may your <lb/>
            bliss be immortal on high' is a sad slip in a classical scholar. Yet, as <lb/>
            a paraphrase, the composition is certainly above mediocrity, and may <lb/>
            be read at any time with pleasure, at times with delight. Sandford's <lb/>
            is free from such faults, and is a fine—a noble version. But does <lb/>
             <pb n="269"/>
            not the power of the Greek song dwell in the names and in the proud <lb/>
            repetition-the loving iteration-of the names of the destroyers ? <lb/>
            They are in every stanza-the lines they fill are the words of the <lb/>
            spell. Drop them, and the charm is broken-the singer absurd with <lb/>
            his myrtle and sword. You might just as well in translating into <lb/>
            another language- <lb/>
            Scots wha hae wi' Wallace bled, <lb/>
            Scots wham Bruce has aften led, <lb/>
            omit Wallace and Bruce, and give us 'the noble and brave.' Elton <lb/>
            felt that; and therefore his version has not only bones, which the <lb/>
            others have, and soul, which they have too, but the soul of the poet <lb/>
            and the patriot, as it is flung into his exulting and threatening song <lb/>
            of vengeance, triumph and restoration. For that, and for its general <lb/>
            flow and glow, we pronounce Elton's version, which is free but not <lb/>
            paraphrastic, by far the best."</p>
          <p>To some part of this criticism I assent, but not to all. I agree <lb/>
            that Sandford's is a noble paraphrase. Denman's versions have not <lb/>
            very much to recommend them. Elton's is undoubtedly the best: its <lb/>
            fault is, that it is somewhat too stately both in style and versification. <lb/>
            The simplicity, the easy flow and song-like character of the verses <lb/>
            should be preserved in the translation, if possible. I present my own <lb/>
            attempt with diffidence :—</p>
          <p>With myrtle I shade my falchion-blade <lb/>
            Like Aristogiton of old <lb/>
            And his patriot comrade bold, <lb/>
            When they made the tyrant bleed <lb/>
            And Athens from thraldom freed.</p>
          <p>Harmodius, our pride, thou hast not died! <lb/>
            In the islands of the blest <lb/>
            In eternal peace and rest <lb/>
            With Achilles and Tydeus' son <lb/>
            Thou dwellest, beloved one!</p>
          <p>With myrtle I shade my falchion-blade <lb/>
            Like Aristogiton of old <lb/>

            How the tyrant's might they quell'd.</p>
          <p>Harmodius, lays of your country's praise <lb/>
            For a crown of glory shall be <lb/>
            To Aristogiton and thee ; <lb/>
            For ye made the tyrant bleed <lb/>
            And Athens from thraldom freed.</p>
          <p>Last I shall present to the reader Sir William Jones' Ode in imita­ <lb/>

            <title type="sub">ATHENIAN FESTIVALS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>XENOPHON in his treatise on the Athenian republic (iii. 8) says <lb/>
            that there were twice as many festivals at Athens as in any other <lb/>
            city of Greece. And not only in the number of festivals, but in <lb/>
            their costliness and splendour they greatly surpassed all their neigh­ <lb/>
            bours. Were the Athenians more pious than the rest of the <lb/>
            Greeks ? were they more deeply impressed with a sense of religious <lb/>
            duties ? This was their boast, and there may have been much truth <lb/>
            in it.' But piety was not the only reason which induced them to <lb/>
            worship the gods with greater solemnity than others. Love of <note type="footnote"> (1) Josephus (contra Apionem, it 11,) says that the Lacedæmonians were the <lb/>
            bravest of the Greeks, and the Athenians the most pious. That the Athenians <lb/>
            themselves should make it their boast, is not surprising. Thus, Lycurgus cent. <lb/>
            Leocrat. 149. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πλει̃στον διαφέρετε τω̃ν ἄλλων ἀνθρώπων τῳ̃</foreign> Te <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρὸς</foreign> Tour <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεοὺς</foreign> </note> <figure type="illustration">

              feasting and amusement had certainly quite as much to do with the <lb/>
              matter. Of those magnificent sacrifices provided at the public cost <lb/>
              for Zeus, Athene, Artemis, and other of the tenants of Olympus, the <lb/>
              Athenian multitude partook more largely than did the divinities <lb/>
              themselves: and if a hecatomb was immolated to the Father of the <lb/>
              Gods, a considerable number of poor citizens, who never tasted meat <lb/>
              at their ordinary meals, were sumptuously regaled without spending <lb/>
              an obol of their own money.1 When we consider too the intense <lb/>
              delight which they took in the shows, games, processions, and dra­ <lb/>
              matic exhibitions, the cost of all which was defrayed partly out of the <lb/>
              public purse, and partly by a few wealthy individuals, can we wonder <lb/>
              that the grand festivals, on which these amusements were provided <lb/>
              gratis for the people, were regarded by them as the brightest days in <lb/>
              the calendar ? Böckh observes, that the celebration of these festivals <lb/>
              in the best times of the Athenian republic created a profuseness of <lb/>
              expenditure not inferior to that of the most luxurious princes. That <lb/>
              there was a mixture of good and evil in it, cannot be doubted. The <lb/>
              dramatic and musical contests were calculated to refine and to elevate <lb/>
              the national mind; while, on the other hand, the too frequent recur­ <lb/>
              rence of public amusements and the dissolute character of many of <lb/>
              them had a tendency to demoralise and enervate. We have seen <lb/>
              how Demosthenes2 reproves his countrymen for their devotion to <lb/>
              spectacles and sacrifices; how he complains not only of the spirit of <lb/>
              idleness which they engendered, but of the loss occasioned to the <lb/>
              revenue. Plutarch3 in his Essay on the Glory of Athens, while he <lb/>
              dilates on the grandeur of her theatrical entertainments, relates the <lb/>
              opinion expressed by a Lacedæmonian upon the subject—namely— <lb/>
              " that the Athenians made serious matters of trifles and lavished on <lb/>
              the theatre sums sufficient for the equipment of large fleets and <lb/>
              the maintenance of great armies: that, if it were calculated what <lb/>
              each play cost them, it would be found they had spent more treasure <lb/>
              upon Bacchæs and Phænissæs and Antigones and the woes of Medea <lb/>
              and Electra, than upon wars waged for empire and deliverance from <lb/>
              the barbarians."</p>
          <p>The following is a list of the principal Athenian festivals which are <lb/>
            known to us. We must bear in mind that, besides all these religious <note type="footnote"> (1) At the thanksgiving for the battle of Marathon, five hundred kids were sacri­ <lb/>
            ficed to Artemis Agrotera: to which Aristophanes jestingly alludes, when he makes <lb/>
            the sausage-seller propose to sacrifice a thousand, if sprats should become cheap, <lb/>

              sacrifices at Athens from the fact, that the money received for skins in the third <lb/>
              year of the hundred and eleventh Olympiad was more than five thousand drachms <lb/>
              for seven months. (Public Economy of Athens, Translation, p. 283.) </note><note type="footnote"> (2) See particularly the third Olynthiac, this Translation, vol. i. p. 59: and the <lb/>

            <title type="sub">ADONIA.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>The feast of Adonis, celebrated by women only, in the month <lb/>
            Munychion. It lasted for two days. The first was a day of <lb/>
            mourning, when they brought images into the streets, representing <lb/>
            the corpse of Adonis, and uttered the cries and lamentations <lb/>
            customary at funerals. The second was a day of rejoicing for the <lb/>
            supposed restoration of Adonis to life at the entreaty of Venus. The <lb/>
            mourning for Adonis occurring on the eve of the Sicilian expedition <lb/>
            was considered an unlucky omen, as we are informed by Plutarch.1</p>
          <p>These rites, founded on the tale so familiar to all, were brought <lb/>
            into Greece from Syria or Egypt.2 Adonis was the Syrian Thammuz, <lb/>
            whose worship found its way even to Jerusalem, as we know from the <lb/>
            prophet Ezekiel, (viii. 14.) " Then he brought me to the door of the <lb/>
            gate of the Lord's house which was towards the north; and behold, <note type="footnote"> (1) Plutarch, Vit. Alcib. 18. Aristophanes alludes to the same thing in the <lb/>

             <pb n="273"/>
            there sat women weeping for Thammuz." On which are founded <lb/>
            the beautiful lines of Milton in the first book of Paradise Lost: <lb/>
            The love-tale <lb/>
            Infected Sion's daughters with like heat, <lb/>
            Whose wanton passions in the sacred porch <lb/>
            Ezekiel saw, when by the vision led <lb/>
            His eye survey'd the dark idolatries <lb/>
            Of alienated Judah.</p>

            <title type="sub">AGLAURIA.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>A festival in honour of Aglauros (or Agraulos,) daughter of <lb/>
            Cecrops, who, with her sisters Pandrosus and Erse, was an object of <lb/>
            much veneration at Athens. There are many romantic legends con­ <lb/>
            cerning them, which may be read in Ovid and other authors. One <lb/>
            is, that Aglaurus threw herself down from the Acropolis in pur­ <lb/>
            suance of an oracle, which declared that such a sacrifice was neces­ <lb/>

          <p>On the first day the clansmen met at the house of some opulent <lb/>

          <p>It has already been mentioned (ante, p. 66) that this festival, <lb/>

              the city; in which the whole population offer sacrifice, many not with <lb/>
              victims, but with cakes1 in their country fashion."</p>
          <p>Aristophanes speaks of the Diasia as an occasion of feasting and <lb/>

            Aristophanes, v. 984.2</p>
          <p>" The Buphonian festival grew out of the sacrifices in honour of <lb/>
            the Zeus Polieus. In the earlier stages of Athenian civilisation the <lb/>
            nature of the soil and the use which was made of oxen for the purposes <lb/>
            of agriculture required that the utmost care should be taken to Keep <lb/>
            up so valuable a stock. The life of an ox was accordingly put upon <lb/>
            the same footing with that of a man; and the altars of Jupiter, before <lb/>
            which whole hecatombs fell in after-times, were then satisfied with the <lb/>
            offering of a little salted meat and a few cakes. The first slaughter <lb/>
            of an ox was a circumstance to put the whole of the little town of <lb/>
            Cecropia, as Athens was then called, into a state of unwonted agita­ <lb/>
            tion. It happened during the reign of Erechtheus and under par­ <lb/>
            ticular circumstances. The usual sacrifice in honour of the Zeus <lb/>
            Polieus was taking place in the Acropolis, when an ox accidentally <lb/>
            breaking loose ran towards the offerings and began to make free with <lb/>
            them. One Thaulon, or, according to Porphyry, the priest of Jupiter <lb/>
            himself, irritated by this sacrilegious intrusion, struck him dead with <lb/>
            a blow of his hatchet. A consciousness of legal guilt however <lb/>
            presently came across him; he dropped his hatchet in a fright and <lb/>
            fled for his life. A law was now passed, that in future this particular <lb/>
            day of the feast should be called Buphonia, and that certain ceremonies <lb/>
            should be observed in memorial of the first slaughter of an ox. Ac­ <lb/>
            cordingly it became an established custom, that, just as every thing <lb/>
            was prepared for the usual sacrifice, a number of oxen should be made <lb/>
            to pass by the altar, and that the one who tasted of the offerings on it <note type="footnote"> (1) Cakes of dough made in the shape of victims. Such is the explanation of <lb/>

              should be put to death. The custom farther enjoined certain young <lb/>

              instruments of sacrifice, the servants of the God bringing the instru­ <lb/>

              was the blow struck, than with all the marks of terror in his counte­ <lb/>
              nance he let fall the axe and fled for his life. His accomplices in the <lb/>
              meantime partook of the victim; the skin of the animal was sewed <lb/>
              up, having previously been filled with hay; and the party, having <lb/>
              tied this shapeless mass to a plough, proceeded to justify themselves <lb/>

              who had furnished the water for sharpening the sacrificial instruments, <lb/>
              laid the blame upon those who had actually sharpened them; these <lb/>
              transferred it to the slaughterers of the victim, while the slaughterers <lb/>
              referred the guilt to the hatchet itself, which had committed the <lb/>
              murder. This last, having no means of pleading its own cause, was <lb/>

            equality with the rich and great, and who deserved the gratitude of <lb/>
            all classes of mankind. While to Ceres they were indebted for the <lb/>
            principal necessaries of life, to Bacchus they owed the chief source <lb/>
            of its pleasure and joy.1 Dissipat Evius curas edaces, is a sentiment <lb/>

          <p>Horace's verses (Carm. I.18.)— <lb/>
            Siccis omnia nam dura Deus proposuit; neque <lb/>
            Mordaces aliter diffugiunt sohcitudines. <lb/>
            Quis post vina gravem militiam aut pauperiem crepat <lb/>
            Quis non te potius, Bacche pater, teque, decens Venus ?</p>
          <p>(Carm. III. 22.)- <lb/>
            Tu spem reducis mentibus anxiis <lb/>
            Viresque, et addis cornua pauperi, <lb/>
            Post te neque iratos trementi <lb/>

          <p>Or those of Tibullus (I. 7, 41.)— <lb/>
            Bacchus et afflictis requiem mortalibus affert, <lb/>
            Crura licet duro compede pulsa sonent. <lb/>
            Non tibi sunt tristes curæ nec luctus, Osiri, <lb/>
            Sed chorus et cantus et levis aptus amor— <lb/>
            are but the forerunners of Dryden's— <lb/>
            Bacchus ever fair and young <lb/>
            Drinking joys did first ordain; <lb/>
            Bacchus' blessings are a treasure, <lb/>
            Drinking is the soldier's pleasure, <lb/>
            Rich the treasure, <lb/>
            Sweet the pleasure, <lb/>
            Sweet is pleasure after pain: <lb/>
            and hundreds of similar effusions, <lb/>
            When Caliban says- <lb/>
            That's a brave god and bears celestial liquor; <lb/>
            I will kneel to him— <lb/>
            he only does that which the Greeks, or Egyptians, or Phœnicians, <lb/>
            or whoever were the first worshippers of Dionysus, did, when they <lb/>
            created for themselves an imaginary Wine-God.1</p>
          <p>A feast of Bacchus was celebrated in very early times in the rural <lb/>
            districts of Attica. It was a thanksgiving for the vintage which had <lb/>
            just been got in. Peasants assembled carrying thyrsi, or poles sur­ <lb/>
            mounted with bunches of vine-leaves. The goat was sacrificed to <lb/>
            the God, on whose tree he committed depredation. A joyful hymn <lb/>
            was sung round the altar; this was afterwards exalted into the <lb/>
            dithyramb. There were songs also of a grotesque and ludicrous kind, <lb/>
            accompanied with dances of the same character. The performers <lb/>
            wore masks or smeared their, faces with the lees of wine. Who <lb/>
            could have thought that the glories of the Attic drama would spring <lb/>
            from such an origin ? There were rude processions and mummeries, <lb/>
            in which the slaves were allowed the same liberties as their masters. <lb/>
            One part of the diversion was to mount in a wagon, and assail the <lb/>
            passers-by with coarse and obscene jests2. Another was the Asco­ <lb/>
            liasmus,3 or dancing on goat-skins smeared with oil; in which the <note type="footnote"> (1) See Herodotus, ii. 48, 49, and Mitchell's Introduction to his edition of the <lb/>

            same laughable accidents occurred as at our fairs, where people run <lb/>
            races in bags. Virgil compares the Attic vintage-fairs with those of <lb/>
            ancient Italy, (Georgic, II. 380.)</p>
          <p>Non aliam ob culpam Baccho caper omnibus aria <lb/>

          <p>This rude kind of worship, forming the basis of that which was <lb/>
            adopted in the state religion of Athens, underwent considerable <lb/>
            changes not only by the increased splendour of its ceremonial, but <lb/>
            by the importation of novel and mystic rites from Thrace, Phrygia, <lb/>
            and Egypt. The simple Wine-God was exalted into a greater <lb/>
            Deity, who inspired his votaries with a more potent enthusiasm. <lb/>
            Such was the Dionysus Zagreus, a Deity of the Orphic Theology, <lb/>
            whose' worship was introduced at Athens by Onomacritus. He was <lb/>
            the son of Zeus and Persephone, and reputed to be equal with <lb/>
            his father: mangled and slain by the Titans, he was afterwards <lb/>
            mysteriously reborn from the Theban Semele. He was associated <lb/>
            in religious honours with Ceres and with Rhea; he received the <lb/>
            Thracian titles of Evius and Sabazius; he was often identified with <lb/>
            the Egyptian Osiris, as Ceres was with Isis.2 His worship was <lb/>
            attended with frantic orgies, and with the exciting music of the <lb/>
            flute, the drum, and the timbrel: men and women went promis­ <lb/>
            cuously in wild procession, disguised as Satyrs and Nymphs, wearing <lb/>
            the fawn-skin, and carrying not only the vine-branch, but the oak, <lb/>
            the pine, the yew, and the ivy.3 The Phallus was borne aloft, as the <note type="footnote"> (1) Pausanias, viii. 37. Herodotus, vii. 6. Faber's Origin of Pagan Idolatry, it <lb/>

              emblem of fertility.1 The holy madness with which the God inspired <lb/>
              his followers was believed to be of a prophetical character.2 There <lb/>
              were Bacchanalian mysteries communicated to those who liked to be <lb/>
              initiated, which, as it was supposed, had a peculiar efficacy in <lb/>
              relieving the afflicted conscience, and reconciling the guilty mortal <lb/>
              with the offended deities. In later times the business of imparting <lb/>
              these mysteries fell, as we have seen, into the hands of jugglers and <lb/>
              impostors, who made a lucrative trade of it.8 The persons most <lb/>
              powerfully smitten with the Bacchanalian frenzy were, as might be <lb/>
              expected, the women, who not only found a wonderful charm in the <lb/>
              orgies themselves, but eagerly embraced the opportunity which they <lb/>
              afforded of breaking from domestic seclusion. They probably had <lb/>
              some influence in extending the celebration of these Bacchic mysteries, <lb/>
              which appear in the first instance to have met with violent opposi­ <lb/>
              tion, as we see from the legends of Lycurgus and Pentheus, which <lb/>
              were dramatised with great effect by Æschylus and Euripides. The <lb/>
              latter in his beautiful play of the Bacchæ describes the deadly <lb/>
              struggle between Pentheus and the new Divinity, in which Pentheus, <lb/>
              though he has the best of the argument, is crushed by the God's <lb/>
              superior power. The women are the chief instruments of his <figure type="illustration">

          <p>Mrs. Hemans expresses her astonishment that Bacchus. should <lb/>
            have been crowned with the ivy:— <lb/>
            Oh, how could fancy crown with thee <lb/>
            In ancient days the god of wine, <lb/>
            And bid thee at the banquet be <lb/>
            Companion of the vine ? <lb/>
            Thy home, wild plant, is where each sound <lb/>
            Of revelry hath long been o'er, <lb/>
            Where song's full notes once peal'd around, <lb/>
            But now are heard no more.</p>
          <p>Had he been nothing more than the Wine-God, perhaps the ivy <lb/>
            should have been dispensed with: but there were the mysteries <lb/>
            variis obsita frondibus.</p>
          <p>I must return however to the subject of the Attic Dionysia. <lb/>
            According to the more generally received opinion,1 there were four <lb/>
            Attic festivals in honour of Bacchus, celebrated in the four con­ <lb/>
            secutive months, Posidon, Gamelion, Anthesterion, and Elaphebolion, <lb/>
            December, January, February, and March.</p>
          <p>I. The little or rural Dionysia, in the month Posidon. This was <lb/>
            celebrated in each of the townships of Attica, under the superin­ <lb/>
            tendence of the local magistrates. It was the vintage-feast of the <lb/>
            olden times, with such additional amusements as modern invention <lb/>
            had introduced; the principal of which were scenic or dramatic <lb/>
            exhibitions. There were provincial theatres at which old pieces were <lb/>
            performed by strolling players. We have seen how Demosthenes <lb/>
            taunts AEschines with playing third parts on the stage at Colyttus. <lb/>
            (Vol. ii. pp. 72, 90.) While however m the purely rural districts this <lb/>
            feast retained for the most part its ancient simplicity, that in the <lb/>
            Piræus, though considered as a rural feast in point of law, was <lb/>
            celebrated with as much magnificence as the city festivals.</p>
          <p>II. The Lenæa, or festival of the wine-press, was solemnized in the <lb/>
            month Gamelion, which the ancient Ionians called Lenæon. It was <note type="footnote"> (1) The point is considered to have been established by Böckh, in opposition to <lb/>
            Ruhnken's theory, which was, that the Lenæa and the Anthesteria were the same. <lb/>
            Reference to these authors will be found in the Archaeological Dictionary, title <lb/>
            Dionysia, and in Buttman'a first Excursus to the Oration against Midias, where some <lb/>
            of the arguments are briefly stated. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="284"/>
            superintended by the King-Archon. There was a grand procession <lb/>
            to the temple of Lenæan Bacchus, together with dramatic per­ <lb/>
            formances, as we have seen by the law cited in the Oration against <lb/>
            Midias, (Ante, p. 67.) This temple stood in the district called <lb/>
            Limne, or the Marsh, and Hesychius tells us that dramas were <lb/>
            performed here before the new theatre was built. As this festival <lb/>
            occurred at a time of the year when all navigation was stopped, the <lb/>
            spectators were almost entirely natives of Attica; 1 and perhaps, as <lb/>
            Mitchell observes, the country people came then to visit their <lb/>
            friends in the city, who returned the hospitalities shown them at the <lb/>
            vintage-home.2 *</p>
          <p>III. The Anthesteria, which occupied three days, from the eleventh <lb/>
            to the thirteenth of Anthesterion, and which, like the Lenæa, were <lb/>
            under the superintendence of the King-Archon. This was a festival <lb/>
            devoted especially to the tapping and tasting of the new wine; to <lb/>
            which a more serious rite was added, apparently as a corrective to <lb/>
            the gross and sensual tendencies of the former.</p>
          <p>The first day was called Pithoigia, or the broaching of the wine­ <lb/>
            casks.</p>
          <p>The second was called Choes, or the Cups : tippling was literally <lb/>
            the order of the day, and drunkenness an act of gratitude to the <lb/>
            God. Prizes were given to those who could drink the quickest <lb/>
            and the most.3</p>
          <p>The other sports were of the same character; this being for the <lb/>
            city what the December feast was for the country, a sort of Carnival <lb/>
            and Saturnalia. On the eve and during the night of this second <lb/>
            day there were mysteries, celebrated by women only in the temple <lb/>
            of Bacchus in the Marsh. The wife of the King-Archon presided <lb/>
            over them, with the assistance of fourteen women specially conse­ <lb/>
            crated to the God. An oath which they took on the occasion is <lb/>
            preserved in the Oration of Demosthenes against Neæra, p. 1371. <note type="footnote"> (1) Aristophanes, Achamians, 502.— </note> <figure type="illustration">

              was acted at the Lenæan festival. But we must remember that Dicæopolis is there <lb/>
              addressing the spectators, and discussing realities, whereas in the other passages <lb/>
              the action of the play is going on. The same argument might be used to identify the <lb/>
              rural Dionysia with the Lenæa. See v. 202. </note> <pb n="285"/>

            in Roman Catholic countries could hardly be more striking than that <lb/>
            from the first two days to the third of the Anthesteria. If the first <lb/>
            two belonged to the living, the third, as we collect from a passage <lb/>
            of Theopompus, preserved by a Scholiast on the Frogs, as exclu­ <lb/>
            sively belonged to the dead; and if the people of Attica pampered <lb/>
            their own bodies or those of their visitors on the first two days, the <lb/>
            third called uponthem to offer up prayers for the repose of souls <lb/>
            departed; the festival itself bearing the name of Chytri, from the <lb/>
            pots containing the seeds or shell-fruits which on this solemn <lb/>
            occasion were offered to Hermes Chthonius."</p>
          <p>IV. The great or city Dionysia, celebrated in the month of <lb/>
            Elaphebolion, was the most splendid of them all. It was the spring <lb/>
            of the year; the seas had again become navigable; and a concourse <lb/>
            of visitors from all parts of Greece was drawn to Athens either <lb/>
            by business or pleasure or both. A grand procession in honour of <lb/>
            Bacchus, choruses of dancers and musicians, and dramatic per­ <lb/>
            formances in the theatre, were the principal of the appointed <lb/>
            solemnities. The new tragedies and comedies were now brought <lb/>
            out, exciting the most eager competition for victory and an intense <lb/>
            interest among the audience. The chief Archon presided, and <lb/>
            distributed the prizes. It was upon this occasion that Demosthenes <lb/>
            was to be crowned in the theatre under the decree of Ctesiphon. <lb/>
            It was upon this that he officiated as Choragus, when he was <lb/>
            insulted by MEdias. Besides these grander exhibitions conducted <lb/>
            under state regulations, there were others equally attractive to a <lb/>
            different class of spectators, to the great rabble of boys, slaves, and <lb/>
            miscellaneous multitudes that were gathered in the town. Athens <lb/>
            was indeed a vast fair; the best idea of which is to be gathered <lb/>
            from the lively descriptions of such writers as Mitchell and Beeper. <lb/>
            An extract from the Charicles, Scene X., will conclude the present <lb/>
            subject :­</p>
          <p>" Innumerable guests had poured in to the scene of the festival <lb/>
            from all the regions of Greece; every house was kept open for the <lb/>
            reception of distant friends; every tavern was too small to accommo­ <lb/>
            date its crowd of visitors. Many had even erected booths in the <lb/>
            streets and public places, intending to turn the festival to profit; <lb/>
            for, besides the sight-seers and pleasure-hunters, a mass of the <lb/>
            lower classes had come in the hopes of picking up something <lb/>
            among such a confluence of idlers. Retail dealers of all descrip­ <lb/>
            tions had arrived: bevies of Corinthian beauties, jugglers and <note type="footnote"> (1) Introduction to the Frogs, p. 117. It appears that comic dramas were at <lb/>
            times performed on this day; upon which this ingenious writer (in 1. c.) has a long <lb/>
            discussion, to which I must refer the reader. Compare the Scholiast and notes on the <lb/>
            Frogs, 210. </note> <lb/>

            strolling mountebanks laden with the apparatus of their art and the <lb/>
            decorations of their booths : all were ready to devote their utmost <lb/>
            exertions to the amusement of the public and the replenishment of <lb/>
            their own purses. <lb/>
            ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗</p>
          <p>" The Dionysia had begun, and pleasure was the sole pursuit of all <lb/>
            through the live-long day. Strangers and citizens paraded the <lb/>
            streets in holiday attire, with garlands on their brows; altars and <lb/>
            Hermæ were wreathed with chaplets: and in every thoroughfare <lb/>
            stood huge bowls filled with the gift of the God, inviting all that <lb/>
            liked to drink to their very hearts content.</p>
          <p>" Everywhere peals of loud laughter and boisterous mirth assailed <lb/>
            the ear; nought was to be seen but troops of merry-makers, and <lb/>
            reckless swarms of comastæ, impudently caricaturing the pomp and <lb/>
            ceremony of the festal procession.</p>
          <p>" But the most curious sight of all was the mob that beset the <lb/>
            theatre. Since early dawn the seats had been crammed with <lb/>
            spectators, who attentively followed the solemn contest of the <lb/>
            tragedians, previous to being diverted a little later by the more <lb/>
            lively fare of the comedians. From time to time stormy rounds <lb/>
            of cheering and applause burst from the serried mass; while at <lb/>
            intervals might also be heard a shrill whistling, directed at an <lb/>
            obnoxious passage in the play or the bad performance of some <lb/>
            actor, or perchance meant for some one among the audience.</p>
          <p>" Outside the theatre also sight-seers of more humble pretensions <lb/>
            found abundant materials for amusement. Here a puppet-man had <lb/>
            set up his little theatre, and with practised hand guided the hid­ <lb/>
            den strings that set in motion pigmy figures, which performed the <lb/>
            most grotesque antics to the intense delight of the children and <lb/>
            nurses standing round. Elsewhere a Thessalian exhibited the <lb/>
            dexterity of two damsels, who with the most infinite coolness and <lb/>
            agility made surprising leaps, amidst sharp sword-blades stuck <lb/>
            upright in the ground, threw somersaults, or sitting down upon a <lb/>
            potter's wheel in rapid motion read and wrote with ease; whilst the <lb/>
            man himself from time to time opened his mouth wide and let fly a <lb/>
            stream of sparks among the horrified spectators, or with apparent <lb/>
            difficulty gulped down swords and daggers. Not far off a juggler <lb/>
            had pitched his tent, taking the prudent precaution of placing <lb/>
            projecting barriers to keep over-curious observers from his apparatus <lb/>
            table. Simple rustics and fishermen beheld with wonderment, how <lb/>
            at first the pebbles lay one under each of the mysterious cups, then <lb/>
            all are under one, after which they all vanished, finally reappearing <lb/>
            out of the conjurors mouth. But when, after causing them to dis­ <lb/>
            appear a second time, he finally drew them all three out of the nose <lb/>
            and ears of the nearest spectator, several of them scratched their <lb/>
            heads as not knowing what to make of it, and one plain countryman <lb/>
            shaking his head said to his neighbour, 'I say, if this chap come near <lb/>
             <pb n="287"/>
            my farm, then good bye to goods and gear.' But the heartiest <lb/>
            laughter was heard round the booth of a man who was exhibiting <lb/>
            a number of trained monkeys, dressed in motley suits, with masks <lb/>
            before their faces, and which performed elaborate dances like so <lb/>
            many well-behaved human beings. The trainees switch kept them <lb/>
            a long while in order, and his man was just collecting the small <lb/>
            copper coins from the bystanders, when a wag amused himself with <lb/>
            throwing some nuts among the dancers, who in a twinkling, forgetful <lb/>
            alike of all propriety and the parts they played, made a descent on <lb/>
            the prey and began scratching and biting each other for the posses­ <lb/>
            sion of it, to the great amusement of the spectators. The confusion <lb/>
            which ensued was a fine opportunity for the thieves and cut-purses, <lb/>
            who were following their calling in great force and levying contri­ <lb/>
            butions on the crowd or at the tables of the pedlars, where all sorts <lb/>
            of wares, clothes, and ornaments, both false and genuine, were dis­ <lb/>
            played for sale. Not a few of the purchasers, when they came to pay, <lb/>
            found themselves to be minus girdle and purse; but it was Dionysia <lb/>
            time, and so nobody was disconcerted by such occurrences."</p>

          </ab>
          <p>Demeter or Ceres, the Goddess of the earth and the cornfield, was <lb/>
            the object of a very ancient worship at Eleusis in Attica, founded <lb/>
            upon her own personal visit to that country after the loss of her <lb/>
            daughter Persepnone or Proserpine. Who has not heard of the rape <lb/>
            of Proserpine by the Stygian king ? Those who have not read about <lb/>
            it in Ovid or Claudian, may have read the poem of Barry Cornwall. <lb/>
            Homer's hymn to Ceres shows how the Goddess, inconsolable for the <lb/>
            loss of her daughter, wandered over the earth till she came to <lb/>
            Eleusis, where under the disguise of an old woman she was received <lb/>
            into the house of Celeus, king of the country, and became the nurse <lb/>
            of his son Demophoon; she refused for a long time either to talk or <lb/>
            to taste food, and it was only the merry and playful humour of the <lb/>
            maid-servant Iambe that roused her from her deep dejection. She <lb/>
            became fondly attached to the child, and would have made him <lb/>
            immortal, but for the unfortunate curiosity of his mother Metanira, <lb/>
            which led to a discovery of their celestial visitor, who then ordered <lb/>
            that a temple should be erected to her upon a spot near the fountain <lb/>
            Callichorus, where she had first rested from her fatigue. There she <lb/>
            took up her abode for a year, still sorrowing for her daughter, and <lb/>
            inflicting the curse of sterility upon the whole earth, until at length <lb/>
            Jupiter made with her that solemn compact, by which Proserpine <lb/>
            was to be restored to her society for six months of the year, spending <lb/>
            the other six with her infernal consort. No sooner was the wrath <lb/>
            of the Earth-Goddess appeased, than the curse of barrenness was <lb/>
            removed, and the Rharian plain, then first teeming with Cereal <lb/>
            produce, became celebrated for its fertility. To commemorate these <lb/>
            events, and evince her gratitude towards those who had hospitably <lb/>
             <pb n="288"/>
            received her in her distress, Ceres condescended to establish her <lb/>
            own religious worship in the country, of which she constituted Celeus <lb/>
            himself, together with Triptolemus, Diodes, and Eumolpus, the <lb/>
            interpreter. They were the founders of priestly families, in whom <lb/>
            the superintendence of her worship remained long hereditary. The <lb/>
            most distinguished of these in the historical times were the Eumol­ <lb/>
            pidæ, from whom was always chosen the Hierophant, or high-priest of <lb/>
            the mysteries: and who performed other religious duties which we <lb/>
            have already had occasion to notice. (Ante, p. 148.) Triptolemus, <lb/>
            according to another legend, was taught the art of sowing and <lb/>
            ploughing oy Ceres, which he communicated to the world. He is <lb/>
            the unci puer monstrator aratri of Virgil: in Ovid he is the child <lb/>
            whom Ceres nurses.'</p>
          <p>The worship of Ceres, thus founded at Eleusis in very early times, <lb/>
            afterwards, when all the Attic states were united under one govern­ <lb/>
            ment, war adopted by the Athenians and became a part of the state <lb/>
            religion. The Eleusinians, acknowledging their political dependence <lb/>
            on Athens, retained by express stipulation (as Pausanias tells us, I. <lb/>
            38.) the conduct of a worship which had been specially revealed and <lb/>
            entrusted to them: and this m course of time, under the management <lb/>
            of their priests, and with the sanction and aid of the Athenian state, <lb/>
            was expanded into the Festival and Mysteries whose fame is world­ <lb/>
            wide, and which have made the name of Eleusis nearly as celebrated <lb/>
            as that of Athens herself: Eleusina sanctam illam et augustam, <lb/>
            Ubi initiantur gentes orarum ultimæ.</p>
          <p>The festival of the Mysteries, as it was. celebrated in the historical <lb/>
            period of the Athenian republic, and indeed for many centuries until <lb/>
            Its final abolition, is to be regarded in two points of view. In its <lb/>
            external form it was a commemoration of the sorrow and subsequent <lb/>
            gladness of Ceres, and a great part of the ceremonies had reference <lb/>
            more or less direct to the events of the ancient legend. But there <lb/>
            was a secret as well as a public worship. Upon the ceremonial <lb/>
            handed down from the primitive times there were engrafted mysteri­ <lb/>
            ous rites and revelations, which were supposed to exercise a religious <lb/>
            influence upon the mind, and one of a more salutary kind than the <lb/>
            Bacchic mysteries. These were imparted to the communicants upon <lb/>
            certain conditions, one of which was secrecy. What their nature and <note type="footnote"> (1) Compare Apollodorus, i. 5. Callimachus, Hymn. in Cererem. Ovid's Fasti, <lb/>
            iv. 435, &amp;c. Diodorus v. 4, 5, 68. The legends concerning Ceres were many and <lb/>
            various. That the giver of corn and bread should be worshipped as the inventress <lb/>
            of laws and civilization (<foreign xml:lang="grc">θεσμφόρος</foreign>) is not surprising. She was identified also with <lb/>

            Artemidorus, who mentions an island near Britain (Mona probably), where there. <lb/>

            i. 37. Ceryx, progenitor of the Ceryces, was, according to one legend, a son of <lb/>

            character were-whether they had any reference to the doctrine of a <lb/>
            future state-whether they taught any higher and purer notions of <lb/>
            the Deity or of human duty than what was to be found in the pagan <lb/>
            mythology-whether they were imported from Egypt or elsewhere, <lb/>
            or whether they were of Greek origin, and at what particular time <lb/>
            they were introduced-all these matters have been the subject of <lb/>
            various conjecture and controversy. And the point cannot be fully <lb/>
            decided.1 <note type="footnote"> (1) Warburton in his Divine Legation of Moses, book ii. section 4, has collected <lb/>
            an immense number of authorities upon the subject: but they are far from sup­ <lb/>
            porting his theory that " the Mystagogue taught that Jupiter, Mercury, Bacchus, <lb/>
            Venus, Mars, and the whole rabble of licentious Deities, were only dead mortals­ <lb/>
            the errors of Polytheism were detected, and the doctrine of the Unity taught and <lb/>
            explained in the Mysteries." It is indeed of itself highly improbable, that the <lb/>
            priests of the Deities, who officiated at the public worship, should declare in <lb/>
            private to a large body of the worshippers, that the whole thing was a sham <lb/>
            and a falsehood. Such a system of double dealing could not have been carried <lb/>
            on very long. Warburton perceived this difficulty, and tries to avoid it by <lb/>
            suggesting " that the discovery of this Supreme Cause they made consistent with <lb/>
            the notion of local tutelary Deities, beings superior to men and inferior to God, and <lb/>
            by him set over the several parts of his creation." But the question immediately <lb/>
            occurs-who were these tutelary Deities ? Was Ceres one? or was Pallas one? Not <lb/>
            according to Warburton; for they were but dead mortals: and therefore, unless the <lb/>
            priests adopted a new nomenclature in their theology, of which there is no evidence, <lb/>
            they would not have satisfied even the votaries of this more refined polytheism. </note><note type="footnote"> The theory respecting the sixth Book of Virgil's Æneid that the descent of his <lb/>
            hero into the infernal regions was a figurative description of an initiation, and par­ <lb/>
            ticularly a very exact picture of the Spectacles in the Eleusinian Mysteries," has <lb/>
            been successfully demolished by Gibbon. See his Critical Observations on the sixth <lb/>
            Æneid. published in the second volume of his miscellaneous works. Touching the <lb/>
            subject of the Mysteries he observes (p. 500):— </note><note type="footnote"> " But our curiosity is yet unsatisfied; we would press forward into the sanctuary, <lb/>
            and are eager to learn what was the secret which was revealed to the initiated and <lb/>
            to them alone. Many of the profane, possessed of leisure and ingenuity, have tried <lb/>
            to guess what has been so religiously concealed. The secret of each is curious and <lb/>
            philosophical; for, as soon as we attempt this inquiry, the honour of the mysteries <lb/>
            becomes our own. I too could frame an hypothesis, as plausible perhaps and as un­ <lb/>
            certain as any of theirs, did I not feel myself checked by the apprehension of dis­ <lb/>
            covering what never existed. I admire the discretion of the initiated : but the best <lb/>
            security for discretion is, the vanity of concealing that we have nothing to reveal." </note><note type="footnote"> If the secret was, that there was no secret, this could hardly have prevented its <lb/>
            being betrayed, one would imagine. </note><note type="footnote"> Faber, in his learned and interesting work on the Origin of Pagan Idolatry, while <lb/>
            be rejects Warburton's theory respecting the Mysteries, adopts one consonant to his <lb/>
            own views of Pagan worship. His main position is that the polytheism of the <lb/>
            Gentiles was a corruption of the true religion derived from the patriarchal ages; that <lb/>
            all their mythological systems, though varying in form, had the same origin and the <lb/>
            same meaning; their Gods, under different names, were really the same, all resolving <lb/>
            themselves into a single God, who was esteemed the great father, their Goddesses <lb/>
            likewise into one Goddess, who was the great mother ; these two beings ultimately <lb/>
            appearing as a sole divinity partaking of both sexes, who was the parent of the <lb/>
            universe. The great compound Deity however, whom they thus worshipped, wa3 not <lb/>
            the true God, but only the hermaphroditic conjunction of the human parents of man­ <lb/>
            kind, Adam and Eve, or these first parents resuscitated after the deluge in Noah and <lb/>
            his wife. They were the regents of the mundane ship, astronomically worshipped <lb/>
            in conjunction with the sun and moon, and materially identified with the whole frame <lb/>
            of nature. In accordance with these views, which are elaborately set forth and dis­ <lb/>
            cussed in three quarto volumes, he propounds his own theory of the Mysteries-in <lb/>
            which term he comprehends all mysteries, whether Eleusinian, Curetic, Cabiric. <lb/>
            Druidic, or any other; for all in his view were substantially the same. The following <lb/>
            extracts taken from vol. iii. p.III, give the pith of his theory: the argument is pursued <lb/>
            at great length in the whole of the same chapter. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. III. </note> <note type="footnote"> u </note> <note type="footnote"> ["As </note> <pb n="290"/>

          <p>The Athenians took the utmost care, by severe laws and regulations, <lb/>
            to prevent the disclosure of the solemn secrets ; and public opinion <lb/>
            lent its aid for the same purpose. Any profanation of them was a <lb/>
            high misdemeanour, triable only before a jury of the initiated. It <lb/>
            nearly cost Æschylus his life, that he was thought to have spoken of <lb/>
            them in his plays: he was acquitted by the Areopagus, on giving <lb/>
            proof that he was never initiated. One of the charges against <lb/>
            Alcibiades, which led to such serious consequences to Athens, was, <lb/>
            that he had revealed the Eleusinian mysteries and held mock-celebra­ <lb/>
            tions of them at private houses.1 Such conduct would be a far <lb/>
            greater shock to Grecian sentiment than a betrayal of the secrets of <lb/>
            freemasonry would be in England. The feeling is expressed by <lb/>

            Merces. Vetabo, qui Cereris sacrum <lb/>

          <p>The Mysteries were sacred not only to Ceres but to Proserpine. <lb/>
            The two Goddesses were associated as their common guardians.3 Yet <lb/>
            there was a division of them into the Greater and the Lesser; the <lb/>
            one more strictly belonging to Ceres, the other to her daughter. <lb/>
            The Lesser were celebrated in the month of Anthesterion at Agra on <lb/>
            the Ilissus, and were a sort of preparation for the Greater, to which <note type="footnote"> " As the principal hero-god into whom all the others were thought finally to resolve <lb/>
            themselves was the great father Noah, viewed as a reappearance of the great father <lb/>
            Adam, the Mysteries exhibited in a sort of pantomime the mingled fortunes of those <lb/>
            two primeval characters. They displayed the lapse of the soul from original <lb/>
            purity into a state of darkness, confusion, and ignorance. They affected to teach the <lb/>
            initiated how they might emerge from this state, how they might recover what had <lb/>
            been lost, how they might exchange darkness for illumination, how they might pass <lb/>
            from the gloom of error into the splendid brightness of a regained Paradise. They <lb/>
            claimed to confer upon the epoptæ the glorious privilege of seeing things clearly, <lb/>
            whereas before they were floundering in a turbid chaos of error and misapprehension. </note><note type="footnote"> " Paradise however was believed, rightly (I think) believed, to have coincided <lb/>
            geographically with mount Ararat: so that the renovated world commenced from the <lb/>
            very spot where the old world had begun; the second patriarch and his three sons <lb/>
            were manifested in the self-same region where the first patriarch and his three sons <lb/>
            had appeared ; and as the country of Ararat comprehended the site of Eden, when <lb/>
            the mariners of the ark quitted their gloomy confinement, they literally passed from <lb/>
            the dark womb of their great mother into Paradisiacal light and security. The <lb/>
            Mysteries therefore described the great father as being either shut up in an ark and <lb/>
            set afloat on the surface of the water, or as being inclosed within some one of the <lb/>
            many symbols of the diluvian ship. They represented him as remaining in this <lb/>
            state of confinement either during a natural year, or during the mystical great year <lb/>
            of the gods, or during a single day viewed as a type of a year. And they exhibited <lb/>
            him as at length quitting his prison, and returning once more to the light of heaven." </note><note type="footnote"> (1) Thucydides, vi. 28, &amp;c. Andocides, de Mysteriis, ii. 28. Ed. Bekker. This <lb/>

            admission might be obtained in the following year.1 Slaves were <lb/>
            excluded; but citizens of any Greek state, not being of disreputable <lb/>
            character, might, on taking the required oath of secrecy, be initiated. <lb/>
            In later times it was thrown open to all the world.2</p>
          <p>The Great Mysteries were celebrated in Boedromion (August), <lb/>
            lasting nine days, from the 15th to the 23d. The first day was called <lb/>
            the Congregation,3 because the Mysts, or persons who had received <lb/>
            preparatory initiation, assembled at Athens. The second was called <lb/>
            Mysts to the sea, because they went down to the sea-side to undergo <lb/>
            purification. The third was a day of fasting, on the evening of which <lb/>
            they ate cakes of barley from the Rharian plain. On the fourth day <lb/>
            the sacred basket,5 containing poppy and pomegranate seeds, was <lb/>
            drawn by oxen in a wagon, after which women followed carrying little <lb/>
            caskets, tacita sacra cutarum? (Apuleius, Metam. III.) The poppy, <lb/>
            cereale papaver, was sacred to Ceres, because she had eaten of it for <lb/>
            oblivion of her grief; (Servius, ad Virgo Georg. 212. Ovid's Fasti, <lb/>
            IV. 511;) the pomegranate, because (according to the Homeric <lb/>
            hymn, 375,) the eating of a grain had prevented the entire separation <lb/>
            of Proserpine from Pluto. On the evening of the fifth day they <lb/>
            marched to the temple at Eleusis by torch-light; the torch-bearer, <lb/>
            who led the procession, was symbolical of Hecate leading Ceres in <lb/>

              cession along the sacred road with loud and joyous shouts of Iacchus, <lb/>
              lacchus, which were continually repeated by an immense crowd until <lb/>
              they arrived at Eleusis. Hence the day itself was named lacchus, <lb/>
              and a statue of Iacchus with a torch in his hand and a myrtle garland <lb/>
              (who he was, we shall see presently) was carried from the temple of <lb/>
              Ceres. (Pausanias, I. 2.) On the night of this day the persons duly <lb/>
              qualified were initiated into the awful Mysteries in the Eleusinian <lb/>
              templet and were then called Epoptæ, from their being admitted to <lb/>
              a full inspection of the arcana. On the seventh day they returned <lb/>
              to Athens; and, as if to make amends for the serious and solemn <lb/>
              devotions of the night, a licence was given for all kinds of jesting and <lb/>
              joking. The object, as we are told, was, to commemorate the jests <lb/>
              of lambe: but the Attic ladies did not content themselves with such <lb/>
              sportive humour as served to beguile the griefs of Ceres. At a <lb/>
              bridge over the Cephisus, where they stopped to rest, it was the cus­ <lb/>
              tom to assail one another with the same coarse ribaldry as the <lb/>
              Bacchanalians did from their carts at the rural Dionysia. The eighth <lb/>
              was an additional day allowed for initiation, and was called Epidauria <lb/>
              in honour of Esculapius, who, having come too late, had this special <lb/>
              day assigned for him. (Pausanias, it. 26.) The last day was called <lb/>
              Plemochoæ, from a ceremony of emptying two bowls, which perhaps <lb/>
              concluded the whole affair. (Athenæus, XI. 496.)</p>
          <p>But who or what was the Iacchus ? At first, nothing more than <lb/>
            the mystical cry of the worshippers, derived from the word laxi. <lb/>
            Afterwards it came to be personified, and a new mythical personage <lb/>
            arose—Iacchus a son of Ceres, who in process of time was confounded <lb/>
            also with the Bacchic Deity.2 Cicero distinguishes them in his <lb/>
            treatise De Natura Deorum (II. 24.) "Hinc Liber etiam: hunc dico <lb/>
            Liberum Semele natum, non eum quern nostri majores auguste <lb/>
            sancteque Liberum cum Cerere et Liberâ consecraverunt; quod <lb/>
            quale sit, ex mysteriis intelligi potest. Sed quod ex nobis natos <lb/>
            liberos appellamus, idcirco Cerere nati nominati sunt Liber et Libera: <lb/>
            quod in Liberâ servant, Libero non item." What the original Iacchus <lb/>
            however was, appears from the marvellous story related by Herodotus <lb/>
            in his eighth book, which I give in his own words :3</p>
          <p>" Dicseus, an Athenian, who was at this time in exile and in high <note type="footnote"> (1) The temple is represented by Strabo as being of equal capacity with one of the <lb/>
            great theatres of Greece: its interior sacellum he calls a mystic cell or cavern <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">μυστικὸς σηκός</foreign>, ix. 395.) Vitruvius assures us that it was of enormous magnitude, <lb/>
            and that it was originally built without external columns, so that its sides must <lb/>
            have presented the aspect of dead walls in the same manner as the old temples of <lb/>
            Egypt. Aristides confirms the resemblance, observing that the whole of the <lb/>
            spacious interior was comprehended within one house or external wall, as were the <lb/>
            temples of Egypt and Babylonia, and as still are the temples of Hindostan and the <lb/>
            East." Faber, (Origin of Pagan Idolatry, vol. iii. p. 270.) He concludes that it was <lb/>
            constructed like the Labyrinths, with winding passages, by which the aspirants for <lb/>
            initiation were conducted through darkness into light. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) Grote's History of Greece, i. 49. Mitchell's Introduction to the Frogs, p. 98. </note><note type="footnote"> (3) C. 65. Compare Aristophanes, Ranae, 209, 311, 329, 384, and Mitchell's <lb/>

            esteem 'with the Modes, stated that, when the army of Xerxes was <lb/>
            ravaging Attica, then entirely deserted by the Athenians, he happened <lb/>
            to be with Demaratus the Lacedæmonian in the Thriasian plain, and <lb/>
            he saw a cloud of dust advancing from Eleusis, like the dust of about <lb/>
            thirty thousand men: while they were wondering by what people the <lb/>
            dust could be raised, they suddenly heard a voice, and it seemed to <lb/>
            him that it was the cry of the mystic Iacchus: Demaratus, being <lb/>
            ignorant of the Eleusinian rites, asked him what the sound meant, <lb/>
            and he replied—'Demaratus, I am sure that some great disaster will <lb/>
            befal the king's army. For it is plain, since Attica is deserted by <lb/>
            her population, that the voice is a supernatural one, coming from <lb/>
            Eleusis to avenge the Athenians and their allies. And, should it roll <lb/>
            on for Peloponnesus, there will be danger for the king and his army <lb/>
            on the continent: but, if it turn towards the fleet at Salamis, the <lb/>
            king will be in danger of losing his naval force. This festival is <lb/>
            celebrated by the Athenians every year in honour of the Mother and <lb/>
            her Child, and any one of them or of the other Greeks that chooses <lb/>
            is initiated: and the voice which you hear is their shout of Iacchus <lb/>
            at this festival.' To which Demaratus answered—' Keep silence and <lb/>
            tell no other person what you have said. For, should these words be <lb/>
            carried to the king, you will lose your head; and neither I nor any <lb/>
            one else will be able to save you. But keep quiet. As for this army, <lb/>
            the Gods will look to it.'—Such was his counsel. And now, instead <lb/>
            of the dust and the voice, there appeared a nubilous vapour, which <lb/>
            mounting upward moved on towards Salamis in the direction of the <lb/>
            Greek armament: and so they knew that the navy of Xerxes would <lb/>
            be destroyed."</p>
          <p>Mitchell's remarks upon this subject in his Introduction to the <lb/>
            Frogs (page 10) are worthy of our attention:</p>
          <p>" The Grecian Demeter appears, and not merely in poetry, as the <lb/>
            mother of two children, the one representative of the joyous, the <lb/>
            other of the mournful principle of nature; the first hanging at a <lb/>
            maternal breast swoln with the full tide of life, and drinking largely <lb/>
            at its fount; the latter lost for a time to that mothers love, buried in <lb/>
            the depths of earth, and consequently an object to her of deep solici­ <lb/>
            tude and anxiety. The mournful principle has long been, or rather <lb/>
            ought to have been long known to us under the name of Persephone: <lb/>
            -how long is the joyous one of Iacchus to be confounded with the <lb/>
            name of a Deity with whom he originally had nothing in common, and <lb/>
            from whom, if we wish to have correct notions of antiquity in general <lb/>
            and of the proceedings of Aristophanes in the following drama in <lb/>
            particular, we must learn to separate him wide as the poles apart ?</p>
          <p>"But the case of a double principle, a joyous and mournful one, did <lb/>
            not end in Greece with the mere external changes of nature. The <lb/>
            inner world of man was found to have its variations as well as the <lb/>
            outward frame of nature round him. The being, late so gay, sud­ <lb/>
            denly droops, and medical skill cannot tell why. Dreadful visions <lb/>
             <pb n="294"/>
            haunt his couch; and the earth, which had fostered him as a mother, <lb/>
            now borrows a fury form, and seems anxious to shake him from her <lb/>
            bosom. What has occasioned this dreadful change ? The sting of <lb/>
            guilt is at his heart; the wrath of an avenging power has been <lb/>
            awakened; and are there no means, the sufferer asks himself, of <lb/>
            appeasing an offended Deity, or will another life continue the torments <lb/>
            which have so terribly begun in this ? The Being, who framed the <lb/>
            heart to ask these questions of itself, did not leave them to be asked <lb/>
            in vain even in the heathen world, at all events in that portion of it <lb/>
            with which we are best acquainted; and the three imaginary Deities, <lb/>
            whom Attic poets introduced to explain the changes of the external <lb/>
            world, Attic priests called in to satisfy the more fearful maladies of <lb/>
            the moral world. Leaving it to other writers to describe more <lb/>
            minutely the nine days' ntes and ceremonies which took place <lb/>
            annually at Athens or at Eleusis for this purpose, we content our­ <lb/>
            selves with observing generally, that those of the first five were such <lb/>
            as a soul ill at ease and anxious to reconcile itself with an offended <lb/>
            Deity found to be the best adapted to the purpose-fasting, sacrifice, <lb/>
            and prayer—lustral rites by fire and water, and it may be, confession <lb/>
            of sins. But the sixth day arrives, and all is changed: the expiatory <lb/>
            rites are over; the load of present guilt and sorrow is removed-the <lb/>
            glad name of lacchus resounds from mouth to mouth-the joyous <lb/>
            procession is formed, which with the image of lacchus preceding <lb/>
            transports so large a body of worshippers from Athens to Eleusis; <lb/>
            feast and dance consuming the hours there till night arrives, and <lb/>
            solemn revelations assure the listeners not only that sins duly expiated <lb/>
            are forgiven, but that a new life and happier scenes await the departed <lb/>
            good, and that consequently, whether death or a future and eternal <lb/>
            life are in their thoughts, those thoughts might rest in peace and <lb/>
            hope." 1</p>

              tival of Ceres and held it in the highest veneration, we have abundant <lb/>
              evidence. So indeed did all the ancient Greeks, as we are assured <lb/>
              by Pausanias, (X. 31.) The law of Lycurgus, (see Vol. II. p. 321.) <lb/>
              imposing a fine on women for riding in a carriage to the Mysteries, <lb/>
              had both a religious and a political object, to prevent an undue <lb/>
              exhibition of pride, and to put the rich and poor on some footing of <lb/>
              equality upon so solemn an occasion. We have seen how Midias <lb/>
              used to drive his wife to them in a carriage and pair. (Ante, p. 117.) <lb/>
              The occupation of Decelea by Agis rendered it dangerous to walk in <lb/>
              procession as usual by the sacred road, and the worshippers were <lb/>
              obliged to go to Eleusis by sea. Not only did this greatly diminish <lb/>
              the number of those who could attend the festival, but many of the <lb/>
              ancient observances were necessarily discontinued, and the omission <lb/>
              was keenly felt by the people. When Alcibiades returned from exile, <lb/>
              having been made commander-in-chief of all the forces, he conceived <lb/>
              it would be a glorious thing and vastly increase his popularity, if he <lb/>
              could restore the splendour of the old procession, and enable the <lb/>
              mass of the citizens to join in it. He communicated his design to <lb/>
              the Eumolpids and the other priests, and it being approved of, he <lb/>
              made his preparations. To prevent surprise, he sent out his scouts, <lb/>
              posted sentinels on the hills, and secured the passes: then leading <lb/>
              out of the city all the troops that could be spared, and placing the <lb/>
              priestly functionaries with their mystic treasures in the centre, <lb/>
              he led the whole train to Eleusis in perfect order and silence. The <lb/>
              enemy ventured not to interrupt him. After the ceremonies had <lb/>

              the people declaring that he had performed the duties both of a high- <lb/>
              priest and a general. (Plutarch, Vit. Alcib. 34.)</p>
          <p>Upon the whole, though the real nature of the Mysteries has never <lb/>
            been ascertained, it has been commonly thought that some kind of <lb/>
            instruction was conveyed by means of allegorical sights or shows, <lb/>
            perhaps accompanied with explanations by the Mystagogue.1 It would <note type="footnote"> (1) The following passages (among others) are cited by Warburton.—Dio Chry­ <lb/>

              seem too, that the doctrines taught were of a comforting and moral­ <lb/>
              ising tendency. The testimonies of Plato, Aristophanes, Cicero, <lb/>
              and many other writers who are referred to in the Divine Legation, <lb/>
              all conspire to establish this. Notwithstanding some corruptions and <lb/>
              abuses, the high character of the institution was maintained for many <lb/>
              centuries after the extinction of Grecian independence; and people <lb/>
              from all countries came to learn the supposed sacred truths at Eleusis. <lb/>
              Cicero and Atticus were initiated: so was Augustus. Nero, tra­ <lb/>
              yelling in Greece after the murder of his mother, was deterred from <lb/>
              presenting himself for this purpose by the consciousness of his crime. <lb/>
              (Suetonius, Vit. Neron. c. 34.) " Peregrinatione quidem Græciæ, <lb/>
              Eleusiniis Sacris, quorum initiatione impii et scelerati voce præconis <lb/>
              submoverentur, interesse non ausus est." The Christians had a <lb/>
              great aversion to these rites; at which they asserted that horrible <lb/>
              and impious spectacles were exhibited. The Neoplatonists, on the <lb/>
              other hand, set up the Mysteries against Christianity, as if purer and <lb/>
              better doctrines were revealed in them. Amid the general decay of <lb/>
              Pagan worship, they still retained some vestiges of their primeval <lb/>
              sanctity. Julian the Apostate was a zealous believer in them, and <lb/>
              received initiation during his residence at Athens. Valentinian L <lb/>
              issued his command for the suppression of all nocturnal sacrifices; <lb/>
              but Prætextatus, who governed in Greece, persuaded him to make an <lb/>
              exception in favour of the Eleusinian Mysteries, on the plea that <lb/>
              without them life would be insupportable to the Greeks. They <lb/>
              finally perished under the edict of Theodoslus, which abolished Pagan <lb/>
              worship altogether. (See Warburton, ibid. pp. 172, 173, 209—212, <lb/>
              218—220, 254, 262. Gibbon's Decline and Fall, III. 130, 262, <lb/>

          <p>The feast of boughs, which was a celebration of the return of <lb/>
            Theseus from Crete; at which the chief ceremony was a procession <lb/>
            from the temple of Bacchus to that of Athene Šciras at Phalerum, <lb/>
            under the conduct of two youths habited like girls and carrying vine­ <lb/>
            boughs with clusters of grapes. The origin of the custom was this. <lb/>
            When the third occasion arrived for sending to Minos his tribute of <lb/>
            seven youths and seven maidens, Theseus having been chosen as one <lb/>
            of them, he selected two young men of spirit and courage, but with <lb/>
            fair complexions and girlish faces, and after thoroughly disguising <lb/>
            them, and teaching them to counterfeit in every way the voices and <lb/>
            manner of girls, he substituted them for two of the maidens designed <lb/>
            for Crete. Upon their safe return, these two youths marched up in <lb/>
            their female dresses to Athens, and, it being vintage time, they <lb/>
            carried in their hands boughs and clusters of the vine. This costume <lb/>
            was retained after the establishment of the festival; and, as the <lb/>
            object was to commemorate the joy of Athenian parents for the <figure type="illustration">

              deliverance of their children, the bough-bearers were obliged to be <lb/>
              persons whose parents were alive. Another custom, having reference <lb/>
              to the same purpose, was, that certain matrons called Deipnophoræ, <lb/>
              or supper-bearers, busied themselves during the ceremonies in handing <lb/>
              about refreshments for the young people, and telling them amusing <lb/>
              stories, as if they were their mothers cheering them on the eve of a <lb/>
              perilous journey. The presidency of the sacrifices was committed <lb/>
              to the house of the Phytalidæ, in recompense for their former hos­ <lb/>
              pitality to Theseus.</p>
          <p>Further particulars of the fable may be found in Plutarch's Life <lb/>

            <title type="sub">PANATHENÆA.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>This was in some respects the grandest of all the Athenian <lb/>
            festivals, as might indeed be expected, considering that it was in <lb/>
            honour of the tutelary Goddess Athene. Such a festival doubtless <lb/>
            existed in very early times, but it first received this title, implying <lb/>
            its more comprehensive and exalted character, after the union of <lb/>
            the Attic people attributed to Theseus. The story is thus related by <lb/>
            Plutarch ; (Vit. Thes. 24.) I give it in brief:</p>
          <p>" After the death of his father Ægeus, he formed a great design, <lb/>
            and united all the inhabitants of Attica in one city and commonwealth. <lb/>
            There were before that time many separate people, who were con­ <lb/>
            stantly engaged in wars and quarrels. He went from one to the <lb/>
            other, and proposed a union. The lower classes he easily persuaded: <lb/>
            the higher he brought over by promising to establish a republic, and <lb/>
            reserving to himself only the command of the army and the main­ <lb/>
            tenance of the laws: others complied out of fear. He then abolished <lb/>
            all the separate courts, councils, and communities, and built one <lb/>
            council-chamber and city-hall, where it stands to this day: the old <lb/>
            and the new city he formed into one, and named it Athens, ordaining <lb/>
            a common feast and sacrifice to be for ever celebrated, which he <lb/>
            called Panathenæa."</p>
          <p>The festival thus established became an annual one, and was held <lb/>
            in the month of Hecatombæon. The sacrifices were on a scale of <lb/>
            great magnificence. Each town in Attica, and in the prosperous <lb/>
            days of the republic every subject town and colony, contributed a <lb/>
            bull: the flesh of the victims was distributed among the multitude; <lb/>
            and a solemn prayer was offered up for the prosperity of Athens. <lb/>
            (Herodotus, VI. 3.)</p>
          <p>The games and entertainments that followed were numerous and <lb/>
            costly. Demosthenes in the first Philippic speaks of the vast sums <lb/>
            of money that were expended on them. (Vol. 1. p. 69.) There were <lb/>
            gymnastic games, and races of all kinds, including the torch-race. <lb/>
            The race-course by Agræ on the Ilissus, which was either constructed <lb/>
            or completed by Lycurgus, was called Stadium Panathenaicum. <lb/>
             <pb n="300"/>
            (Wordsworth's Athens and Attica, chapter 20.) Not to mention <lb/>
            cock-fights and minor diversions for the masses of the people, there <lb/>
            were pyrrhic and other dances, musical contests in the Odeum, both <lb/>
            vocal and instrumental, first introduced by Pericles: (Plutarch, Vit. <lb/>
            Pericl. 13.) likewise recitations of Epic poetry, more especially that <lb/>
            of Homer by the rhapsodists, which Hipparchus made compulsory ; <lb/>
            (Ælian's Various History, VIlI. 2;) and public disputations by philo­ <lb/>
            sophers: of which last the Panathenaic Oration of Isocrates is a <lb/>
            specimen. Readings of other literary works appear to have been <lb/>
            permitted. Thus Herodotus read his history to the Athenians on <lb/>
            one of these days, as he had done before to the assembled Greeks at <lb/>
            Olympia. (See the preface to Schweighseuser's edition.) The prize in <lb/>
            these contests was an earthenware jar, filled with oil from the Sacred <lb/>
            olive of the Acropolis.1</p>
          <p>With these or most of these games and amusements was the <lb/>
            national festival of Athene solemnized every returning year; and that <lb/>
            it lasted many days, may partly appear from what has been stated. <lb/>
            Every fourth year however it was celebrated on a still grander scale, <lb/>
            with a greater variety of exhibitions, and increased pomp and splen­ <lb/>
            dour ; whence it received the name of the Great Panathenæa. Other <lb/>
            points of distinction between the quadriennial and the annual festival <lb/>
            are not so well ascertained; but the principal glory of the former was <lb/>
            the procession and carriage of the Peplus to the temple of Minerva <lb/>
            Polias.</p>
          <p>The Peplus was a robe or mantle for the statue of the Goddess, <lb/>
            beautifully embroidered in gold. The designs were furnished by the <lb/>
            best artists in Athens, and the needlework executed by virgins <lb/>
            specially selected for the occasion. Various subjects were repre­ <lb/>
            sented on it; but the victory of the Gods over the Titans always <lb/>
            formed one, Jupiter and Minerva being the most prominent figures. <lb/>
            Heroes and men of distinguished merit had a place sometimes allotted <lb/>
            to them in a side of the picture; nor could there be a much higher <lb/>
            panegyric upon an Athenian, than to say that he was worthy of the <lb/>
            Peplus.2</p>
          <p>The procession which conveyed this offering to the Goddess was <lb/>
            attended by an immense concourse of people, men and women, young <note type="footnote"> (1) To which Pindar alludes, Nemea, x. 61.— </note> <figure type="illustration">

              and old, either on foot, or on horseback, or in carriages: 1 in fact the <lb/>
              whole population both of town and country assembled for the occa­ <lb/>
              sion, to celebrate the great event of their national union. The route <lb/>
              which they took, and the order of the proceedings, are described by <lb/>
              Wordsworth in his Athens and Attica (chapter XXIII).</p>
          <p>" The principal feature in the procession was the Panathenaic <lb/>
            peplos, which was carried to the Acropolis as a periodic offering <lb/>
            to Minerva Polias : and with which her statue, in her temple there, <lb/>
            was subsequently invested.</p>
          <p>" The peplos, at the commencement of its course, was hoisted aloft <lb/>
            with cables, like a ship's sail, on a horizontal bar attached to the <lb/>
            summit of a vertical mast; in this position the peplos moved above <lb/>
            the heads of the crowd, with its variegated tissue of battles, its <lb/>
            pictures of chariots and horses, gods and giants, floating in the air <lb/>
            above them.</p>
          <p>" Such was the principal feature of this procession in the best days <lb/>
            of Athens. In later times, when a fantastic ingenuity sought to dis­ <lb/>
            play itself even in religious solemnities, it attracted the wonder rather <lb/>
            than the veneration of the spectator by its bold and complex ma­ <lb/>
            chinery. Then the peplos assumed the character of a real sail; the <lb/>
            nautical genius of Athens displayed itself in this its most gorgeous <lb/>
            national pageant: the props of the peplos performed the functions <lb/>
            of a yard-arm and a mast: its cables were converted into rigging: <lb/>
            and the whole equipage was planted on a stately ship, which sailed <lb/>
            on secret wheels, wafted along by the gale filling the bosom of its <lb/>
            embroidered sail.</p>

          <p>" The particular route, which was chosen for the progress of the <lb/>
            Panathenaic procession through the Athenian city, was dictated no <lb/>
            doubt by the characteristic suggestions of Athenian taste. To pass <lb/>
            through the most splendid streets of Athens, to spread itself abroad <lb/>
            in the squares, to visit the most august temples, to display a new <lb/>
            and pompous spectacle to the theatre, and to pause at last in the <lb/>
            highest and proudest spot in the whole city-in a word, after its <lb/>
            festal voyage, to anchor in the Acropolis-was a duty which this <lb/>
            procession owed both to itself and them. The route therefore which <lb/>
            it followed may serve as a tacit guide to conduct us through the <lb/>
            city of Athens in the most advantageous way.</p>
          <p>" Let us take our station with it at its commencement, at the north­ <lb/>
            west of the city, a little outside the walls, and at the point where <lb/>
            Hippias was engaged in marshalling this same procession, when his <lb/>
            brother Hipparchus fell near the Leocorium in the inner Ceramicus: <lb/>
            we then follow it into the city by the Dipylum; it passes along an <lb/>
            avenue formed by the two parallel arcades, which have been described <lb/>
            above as leading to the Agora, and traverses the circle of the Agora <lb/>
            between the Areopagus and the Pnyx: it enters the valley of Limnæ <lb/>
            lying on the south of the Acropolis, it passes beneath the theatre, <lb/>
            and at length reaches the Eleusinium: this is the point of curvature <lb/>
            in its course. It now tends westward, coasting the northern rocks <lb/>
            of the Acropolis. It ascends the Acropolis itself by the western <lb/>
            entrance through the marble portals of the Propylæa. Here the <lb/>
            procession halts. The peplos is carried to its destination in the <lb/>
            temple of Minerva Polias. <note type="footnote"> the arrival of the great day all Palermo is in commotion. Frame-works of timber <lb/>
            are fabricated, which the carpenters arrange along the Marino, whence the fireworks <lb/>
            may be shown, and an enormous car is made, which being covered over with silken <lb/>
            hangings supports upon poles a lofty stage, and is surmounted by an image of the <lb/>
            saint half hidden in a mass of silken clouds. The car itself is supported upon <lb/>
            low truck wheels ; but on its sides there are four other wheels of a wider span, which <lb/>
            never touch the ground, but are turned round and round by a winch, which some of <lb/>
            the persons whom the hangings conceal set in motion. At an early hour on the <lb/>
            morning of St. Rosalia's day the car is discovered on the Marino. On the stage and <lb/>
            surrounding the image of the saint are groups of women dressed in showy robes <lb/>
            and crowned with flowers, while tied to the four large wheels are little children <lb/>
            whom the silks and feathery wings fastened to their snoulders cause to represent <lb/>
            angels. Tht n there is a sounding of trumpets and ringing of bells, which together <lb/>
            with a volley of patteraros warn the surrounding country that the taint has appeared <lb/>
            among men. </note><note type="footnote"> "No sooner is this clamour heard, than from far and near country people are seen <lb/>
            driving their bullocks towards the city, which they yoke in a long string to the car. <lb/>
            The farmer indeed who should refuse to lend his cattle for this purpose could not <lb/>
            hope to p;osper at the coming vintage; and happy is he who arriving first at the <lb/>
            Marino succeeds in placing his bullocks next the car. Then is the machine set in <lb/>
            motion, while from windows and balconies hats and handkerchiefs wave, and the air <lb/>
            is rent with the tumult of voices, the braying of trumpets, and the roar of artillery. <lb/>
            Thus slowly ;.nd with frequent halts the saint is conveyed through the main street <lb/>
            towards the farther gateway; while, as it moves, the large wheels are turned slowly <lb/>
            round, find the poor little angels go up and down till they are as effectually delivered <lb/>
            from the weght of their morning's meal as if they were at sea in a gale of wind. It <lb/>
            is surprising ihe degree of excitement which the procession seemed to create <lb/>
            throughout the c ty—and the quantities of wine, fruit, sweetmeats, and other viands <lb/>
            consumed are enormous." </note> <pb n="303"/>
            </p>
          <p>" But the naval car does not remain here: it descends again into the <lb/>
            city toward a temple which stood, as may be shown, not far from the <lb/>
            western roots of the Acropolis, on the south side of the Areopagus, <lb/>
            in the Agora. In this temple the vessel was laid up to be exhibited <lb/>
            in after-times as an object of admiration to travellers, when it had <lb/>
            ceased to perform its festal voyages-as the ducal Barge of Venice, <lb/>

          <p>In honour of Pandrosus, daughter of Cecrops. (See Aglauria.) <lb/>
            Her temple formed one of the chambers of the Erechtheum, the other <lb/>
            being that of Minerva Polias. In the grove of Pandrosus were to be <lb/>
            seen the fountain which Neptune raised with his trident and the <lb/>
            impression of the trident upon the rock, and also the olive-tree <lb/>
            produced by Pallas, when the two Divinities contended for the tutelage <lb/>
            of Athens. Erechtheus decided against Neptune, and was killed with <lb/>
            a blow of his trident. He was buried on the spot, and gave a general <lb/>
            name to the temple which was afterwards built there, and in front of <lb/>
            which he had a statue near to that of Eumolpus. The wrath of <lb/>
            the Sea-God was appeased, and he became friendly to the city, in <lb/>
            which his supposed son Theseus reigned. The myths (as usual) are <lb/>
            various. According to one, Eumolpus the Eleusinian, a son of Nep­ <lb/>
            tune, makes war upon Erechtheus, to vindicate his father's claim to <lb/>
            the Athenian Acropolis. According to another, Erechtheus or Erich­ <lb/>
            thonius is a title of Neptune; indicating perhaps the reconciliation <lb/>
            of Neptune to Athene and her city. "The Erechtheum"—says <lb/>
            Wordsworth—" served, as it were, to mediate between the two rival <lb/>
            Deities, Athene and Poseidon, to reconcile them to each other, and to <lb/>
            endear Athens to both."</p>

            <title type="sub">PANIS FESTUM.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>The worship of Pan was first established at Athens after the battle, <lb/>
            of Marathon. Herodotus relates the occasion: (VI. 105. Pausanias, <lb/>
            I. 28.)</p>
          <p>The Athenians, alarmed at the Persian invasion, sent to Sparta <lb/>
            for assistance. Phidippides the courier, as he was passing over mount <lb/>
            Parthenius in Arcadia, heard a voice calling him by his name. It was <lb/>
             <pb n="304"/>
            the God Pan, who desired him to ask the Athenians, why they had <lb/>
            never worshipped a Deity who was friendly to them, who had ren­ <lb/>
            dered them many services, and would render many more. Phidippides <lb/>
            brought back this encouraging message to his countrymen, who, after <lb/>
            the expulsion of the enemy, requited the God for his promised succour <lb/>
            by consecrating to him a grotto in the rocky side of the Acropolis, <lb/>
            and by establishing in his honour an annual sacrifice and torch-race.</p>
          <p>The cave of Pan was, as we have seen (ante, p. 273), not far from <lb/>
            that of Aglaurus. Close to it was the fountain Clepsydra, so called <lb/>
            from the subterraneous flow of its streams in the dry season. (See <lb/>
            Aristophanes, Lysistrata, 721, 911.) A cave would be the most <lb/>
            appropriate place for a temple of the woodland God. The famous <lb/>
            Corycian cave was sacred to Pan and the Nymphs: (Pausanias, X. <lb/>
            32.) As to the universal prevalence of grotto-worship, I refer the <lb/>
            reader to the learned work of George Stanley Faber, who in his third <lb/>
            volume, book V., chapter 7, gives an account of the numerous reli­ <lb/>
            gious caverns that existed in Greece, Italy, Persia, India, Scythia, <lb/>
            Scandinavia, &amp;c. Many of these were artificial excavations in the <lb/>
            rock, made with great care and labour, and forming it into devotional <lb/>
            cells and chapels: among which not the least remarkable are those <lb/>
            at Inkermann in the Crimea. (Ibid. p. 257.) All these are referred <lb/>
            by Faber to his own particular theory, that the grotto represented <lb/>
            the ark of the deluge. On the subject of Pan he writes thus: <lb/>
            (Vol. II. p. 406.)—</p>
          <p>" The Orphic poet celebrates him as the universal father, the true <lb/>
            homed Zeus; and describes him as an infernal God, the conductor <lb/>
            of ghosts like Mercury. He speaks of him as delighting to reside in <lb/>
            caves; a part of his character which is common to nearly all the <lb/>
            arkite Gods, who are continually represented either as dwelling in <lb/>
            caverns, or nursed in caverns, or born in caverns. Porphyry has <lb/>
            written a whole treatise on the subject, in which he gives many <lb/>
            instances of this mode of worship; and he informs us that the sacred <lb/>
            cave represented the world. But the world and the ark were vene­ <lb/>
            rated in mystic intercommunion: the consecrated grotto therefore <lb/>
            shadowed out the latter as much as the former. Hence the birth of <lb/>
            the great father from a cave denoted his birth from the ark. Porphyry <lb/>
            mentions a cave in Arcadia dedicated to Pan and the Moon. By <lb/>
            this it was meant that he was the husband of the Ark. He was <lb/>
            highly venerated by the Arcadians, who borrowed both their name <lb/>
            and their superstition from the ship Argha; insomuch that he was <lb/>
            peculiarly styled the God of Arcadia. Here he was venerated as a <lb/>
            sylvan Deity, who presided over herds of cattle, and who delighted to <lb/>
            roam upon the summits of the loftiest mountains. He was likewise <lb/>
            esteemed a guardian of orchards and a planter of vines; and he was <lb/>
            represented with a sickle or a pruning-knife in his hand, fit for the <lb/>
            purpose of dressing vineyards. In short, to use the language of <lb/>
            Scripture when it speaks of his prototype, he was a husbandman or <lb/>
             <pb n="305"/>
            man of the earth. Yet, while the Arcadians adored him in conjunction <lb/>
            with the Moon, they had a remarkable opinion among them that <lb/>
            they themselves were prior to that planet. This was true of them as <lb/>
            a family: for the primeval arkites were of course prior to the vessel <lb/>
            which they built, and which was astronomically represented by the <lb/>
            Moon."</p>
          <p>But what aid could the Athenians expect from ,the Woodland <lb/>
            Deity ? Pan was not merely a God of woods and shepherds, but <lb/>
            the inventor of stratagems and the exciter of sudden alarms. Po­ <lb/>
            lyænus represents him as a general of Bacchus, defeating superior <lb/>
            forces by a night-attack, having first terrified the enemy by the shouts <lb/>
            of his men, multiplied by reverberation in the hills. From him all <lb/>
            sudden and causeless fears have been called Panic. (Strategem. I. 2. <lb/>
            Pausanias, X. 23. Cicero, Epist. ad Atticum, V. 20.)</p>
          <p>To the same thing Ovid alludes in the Fasti (II. 247), according <lb/>
            to the reading of Gronovius: <lb/>
            Ipse Deus velox discurrere gaudet in altis <lb/>
            Montibus, et subitas concitat ille fugas; <lb/>
            where others read feras.</p>

          <p>This was a festival of Apollo and Diana, celebrated on the 6th and <lb/>
            7th of Thargelion. The first was a day of purification, when we are <lb/>
            told that, according to an ancient custom, two human beings were sacri­ <lb/>
            ficed for the welfare of the whole community. We may reasonably <lb/>
            doubt whether such a such a practice was kept up in the days of Athenian <lb/>
            civilization. If so, it may have been occasional only, and it is <lb/>
            probable, as a learned writer in the Archaeological Dictionary sug­ <lb/>
            gests, (Title Thargelia,) that the persons selected for the expiatory <lb/>
            sacrifice were condemned criminals. The second day was devoted <lb/>
            to amusement, a procession and an exhibition of dancers forming the <lb/>

              whom he observed tearing up a mound of earth with her beak and <lb/>
              talons. Under this was found a coffin of great size, together with <lb/>
              a spear's head and a sword. He carried these precious relics with <lb/>
              great pomp to Athens, where the people came out to meet him and <lb/>
              offered sacrifice to the deceased hero. His ashes were interred in <lb/>
              the north-western part of the city, and a temple was erected on the <lb/>
              spot, which became a perpetual asylum for the oppressed, in remem­ <lb/>
              brance that Theseus while he lived was a protector of innocence and <lb/>
              a redresser of wrong. Pausanias places the Theseum near to the <lb/>
              Gymnasium of Ptolemy; and Wordsworth speaks of its great beauty <lb/>

            <title type="sub">THE DRAMA.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THE reader of Demosthenes should certainly know something <lb/>
            about that drama which formed a part of the Orator's own education, <lb/>
            and which we can see he had deeply studied; from which he and his <lb/>
            competitors drew illustrations of their arguments not unfrequently, <lb/>
            quoting the verses of Sophocles and Eunpides (even more than we <lb/>
            quote Shakspeare) before hearers to whom they were as household <lb/>
            words. If Demosthenes ridicules Æschines, for his murdering Attic <lb/>
            tragedies at Colyttus, it is the bad performance and not the pro­ <lb/>
            fession of an actor which he attacks. We know that this profession <lb/>
            was held in esteem at Athens; Satyrus was the friend of Demo­ <lb/>
            sthenes himself; Neoptolemus and Aristodemus were employed as <lb/>
            diplomatists, and were received even in foreign countries as men of <lb/>
            distinction. We find also in the Orators numerous references to the <lb/>
            Attic theatre and its performances. I say therefore, independently <lb/>
            of other advantages attending a knowledge of the subject, it is far <lb/>
            from being unimportant with reference to these Orations only. The <lb/>
            drama is in fact a part of the history of Athens, which the reader <lb/>
            ought to be acquainted with.</p>
          <p>No subject indeed has been more copiously treated than that of <lb/>
            the Greek theatre, or with a greater profusion of critical learning, <lb/>
            beginning with Bentley and ending with Donaldson. Recommending <lb/>
            the student to seek fuller information, if he needs it, in works of <lb/>
            more profound research, I here propose only to give a brief account <lb/>
            of the origin of the Attic drama, the mode of bringing out and per­ <lb/>
            forming plays at Athens, and a few particulars respecting the theatre <lb/>
            itself.</p>
          <p>That the sublime composition, which we now call tragedy, should <lb/>
            have been derived from the rude songs chanted round the altar of <lb/>
            Bacchus, must appear strange to those who have no knowledge of <lb/>
            ancient history; and yet no fact in history is more certain. Upon <lb/>
            that altar the goat was sacrificed; the singers, disguising themselves <lb/>
            as Satyrs, presented the appearance of goats. Whether the name of <lb/>
            tragedy was derived from either of these causes, or, as Bentley and <lb/>
            others lay it down, from the circumstance that a goat was the prize <lb/>
            of the best poet in the time of Thespis, I will not undertake to <lb/>
            determine. Certain it is that tragedy signified goat-song.</p>
          <p>Out of the rude singing of the Bacchanalians first came the Dithy­ <lb/>
             <pb n="309"/>
            ramb, a choral hymn accompanied by the flute or the lyre. The <lb/>
            chorus, which usually consisted of fifty men, danced in a ring round <lb/>
            the altar, and hence it received the name of Cyclic chorus.1 It <lb/>
            came soon to be composed by poets, or professional persons, who to <lb/>
            the merriment of the old extemporal effusions added a wild poetical <lb/>
            enthusiasm, which greatly delighted their hearers. The Dithyramb <lb/>
            became highly popular in Greek cities; the prize of a bull was given <lb/>
            to the best composer, and great competition was excited. Strictly it <lb/>
            denoted a hymn in honour of Bacchus only, though Lasus of Her­ <lb/>
            mione applied it in later time to subjects unconnected with Bacchus. <lb/>
            During the course of the seventh century before Christ, from the <lb/>
            time of Archilochus to that of Arion, the Dithyramb received divers <lb/>
            improvements. Arion, the famous poet of Lesbos, is said to have <lb/>
            given it the tragic style, meaning that he first composed dithyrambs <lb/>
            of a serious and solemn kind, whereas before his time they had been <lb/>
            always of a jovial character. He is said also to have introduced <lb/>
            Satyrs speaking metrically, perhaps a sort of recitative, to vary the <lb/>
            monotony of the choral music. Here however were the elements of <lb/>
            yet further changes.</p>
          <p>For the next thing was to introduce a solo; and the leader of the <lb/>
            chorus was brought forward, during the intervals of the choral sing­ <lb/>
            ing, to recite or speak something in verse to the audience, to tell <lb/>
            them some story of Bacchus, his birth and his travels, his sufferings, <lb/>
            miracles, and triumphs. The transition from this to a dialogue was <lb/>
            natural and easy. An actor was brought on the scene, who conversed <lb/>
            with the leader of the chorus: their dialogue was all about Bacchus <lb/>
            and his adventures; but the different parts of it had at first no con­ <lb/>
            nexion with each other. Afterwards it was woven into a connected <lb/>
            whole; and formed what we call a plot. Thus gradually rose the <lb/>
            drama.</p>
          <p>The first person who brought the actor upon the stage was Thespis, <lb/>
            and therefore the invention of tragedy has been with some justice <lb/>
            ascribed to him.2 He was a native of Icaria, one of the Attic town­ <lb/>
            ships, from very early times devoted to the worship of Bacchus. <lb/>
            Here, in the last half of the sixth century before Christ, he first <lb/>
            exhibited his plays upon a wooden scaffolding erected for the occa­ <lb/>
            sion at the Dionysian festival. The plays were little better than <lb/>
            extemporaneous effusions, of a rude and chiefly ludicrous descrip- <note type="footnote"> (1) Aristophanes, Ranae, 351.— </note> <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BOHN_19_fig76.jpg"/></figure><note type="footnote"> which refers to the teaching of the chorus by the poet. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) As in the verses of Dioscorides, cited and amended by Bentley (On Phalaris) <lb/>

              tion, Bacchus being the subject of the plot, and the chorus a band of <lb/>
              Satyrs. None of them were ever committed to writing. Bentley has <lb/>
              shown, that those which have come down to us under the name of <lb/>
              Thespis were forgeries of Heraclides, a scholar of Aristotle.</p>
          <p>The is was followed by Chcerilus and Phrynichus, who were indeed <lb/>
            partly his contemporaries, and the latter his pupil. Phrynichus is <lb/>
            said to have been the first composer of dramas having no relation to <lb/>
            Bacchus. The audience were displeased at the novelty, and cried <lb/>
            out, " What has this to do with Bacchus ?" But they soon became <lb/>
            reconciled to it, and found that fables about Hercules or the Centaurs <lb/>
            could afford as much delight as those about Silenus and his Master. <lb/>
            The chorus of Satyrs was preserved for some time, as a relic of the <lb/>
            ancient custom: but when plays of a serious cast were exhibited, it <lb/>
            was felt that the old-fashioned chorus was quite out of place, more <lb/>
            especially when it had nothing to do with the plot. The poet accord­ <lb/>
            ingly adapted his chorus to the drama, whatever the subject might be, <lb/>
            while, as a compensation to the God of the festival, who was not to be <lb/>
            deprived entirely of his ancient honours, a purely Satyric drama, in <lb/>
            which both the dialogue and the choral parts related to the history of <lb/>
            Bacchus, was added to the performance; and it became the rule for <lb/>
            the poet to exhibit one such piece together with three tragic, the four <lb/>
            being called a tetralogy. Chœrilus excelled in the composition of <lb/>
            these Satyric dramas, and Pratinas of Phlyus is said to have been <lb/>
            their inventor: yet, as it would appear, they could hardly have <lb/>
            differed much from the drama of Thespis. Their characteristic was <lb/>
            the burlesqued We have but one extant specimen of them, the <lb/>
            Cyclops of Euripides.</p>
          <p>Phrynichus was a poet of a higher order than any who preceded <lb/>
            him. He was not only famous for the sweetness of his choral <lb/>
            melodies,2 but for the dramatic power which touched the feelings and <lb/>
            roused the passions. Viewed with reference to these qualities, he <lb/>
            better deserves to be called the father of tragedy than Thespis. He <note type="footnote"> (1) " The Athenians possessed another kind of ludicrous drama called the Satyrical, <lb/>
            which was totally distinct from their comedy in its form and its object. It had been <lb/>
            introduced in compliance with ancient usage for the sake of those, who in the im­ <lb/>
            proved state of the drama were still unwilling to lose the chorus of Satyrs, which <lb/>
            once formed a main part of the Dionysiac entertainments: and it exhibited the <lb/>
            highest persons of tragedy thus attended, and under circumstances which were <lb/>
            humorously contrasted with the solemnity of their character. But this kind of <lb/>
            burlesque could scarcely be said to have any other end than that of unbending the <lb/>
            spectator, after his mind had been kept on the stretch by scenes of heroic action or <lb/>
            suffering, with the sportive sallies of a mere animal nature. One of these exhi­ <lb/>
            bitions commonly followed each tragic performance, and it was always furnished by <lb/>
            the tragic poet himself. It is remarkable that Æschylus was accounted no less a <lb/>
            master of the light than of the serious drama: an effect perhaps of the very grandeur <lb/>
            and severity of his tragic style. But there does not appear to have been any instance <lb/>
            in which a tragic poet tried his powers in comedy." Thirlwall, History of Greece, <lb/>

              won his first prize in the year B.C. 511. About seventeen years later <lb/>
              he ventured to dramatise an event of the day, and brought out a piece <lb/>
              called " The Fall of Miletus," which melted the whole audience into <lb/>
              tears; but they fined him a thousand drachms for having reminded <lb/>
              them of a national misfortune, and forbade the play to be ever acted <lb/>
              again. (Herodotus, VI. 21.) Its fate may have suggested to Æschylus <lb/>
              the writing of his Persæ, which celebrated the victories of his <lb/>
              country over the barbarians. In general however the tragedians did <lb/>
              not choose for their subjects the occurrences of the day, but confined <lb/>
              themselves to the ancient legends, such as those of Troy and Thebes, <lb/>
              Hercules, Prometheus, and the house of Pelops.</p>
          <p>Much however remained to be done before tragedy arrived at its <lb/>
            maturity. Phrynichus had brought women into the scene, and in­ <lb/>
            vented a female mask; but he carried on the whole of his dialogue, as <lb/>
            Thespis had done, between the single actor and the chorus; and the <lb/>
            choral songs, with their accompaniment of music and dancing, formed <lb/>
            much the larger portion of his plays. It was reserved for AEschylus <lb/>
            to remedy these defects, and give to tragedy a more purely dramatic <lb/>
            character—first, by the introduction of a second actor; secondly, by <lb/>
            shortening the part of the chorus, and making it subservient to the <lb/>
            plot. To him also the stage was indebted for sundry improvements <lb/>
            in dress and decoration; as, for example, the painting of the scenes, <lb/>
            in which he had the aid of the painter Agatharchus—the buskin, or <lb/>
            high-heeled boot, which gave elevation and dignity to the actor-and <lb/>
            a more expressive sort of mask, which in a large theatre was a point <lb/>
            of considerable importance. The last grand innovation was made by <lb/>
            Sophocles, and, after him, adopted by Æschylus; viz. the third actor: <lb/>
            and this was thought by the best critics to fulfil all the requirements <lb/>
            of the Greek drama, which turning always upon a simple story, brief <lb/>
            in duration, and not overburdened with incidents, a greater number <lb/>
            of players would have impeded rather than have assisted the develop­ <lb/>
            ment of the action. The fifty choristers of the Dithyramb had in the <lb/>
            tragic chorus in the time of Æschylus, and perhaps before, been <lb/>
            reduced to twelve. Sophocles raised them to fifteen; and that con­ <lb/>
            tinued to be the regular number. He, like AEschylus, made improve­ <lb/>
            ments in scenery and dress. How by the genius of these two men <lb/>
            tragedy was exalted in its essential characteristics as a work of art­ <lb/>
            what were the peculiar merits of each as a dramatist, and how they <lb/>
            are to be judged either in comparison with one another, or with their <lb/>
            rival in fame, Euripides—these and the like matters are not intended <lb/>
            to be discussed here.</p>

            Lycambes, who refused to give him his daughter in marriage according to promise, <lb/>
            to hang himself. The metre received its name from lambe, the servant of Celeus, </note><lb/>

            tragedians, has the same fitness for dialogue as our own Shakspearian <lb/>
            verse, and was doubtless chosen for that purpose. The earlier poets, <lb/>
            as Aristotle tells us, (Rhet. iii. 1; Poet. iv.) had employed the Trochaic <lb/>
            tetrameter, as being a more suitable measure for their dancing Satyrs; <lb/>
            and it is occasionally used by the great masters for quick or abrupt <lb/>
            speeches. The Doric dialect was adopted for the songs of the chorus, <lb/>
            on account of the celebrity which Dorian poets had acquired as the <lb/>
            composers of Pæans and other choral hymns.1</p>
          <p>The ancient history of the Satyric and Tragic drama is referred <lb/>
            to, but not with perfect accuracy, by Horace in the well-known <lb/>

            the beginning of the seventh century to Sparta, where he composed music and hymns <lb/>
            to be sung by the people. For anciently the chorus, including dance and song, was <lb/>
            a part of the divine service, performed by the whole of the assembled people, or at <lb/>
            least a considerable number of them. Both the dance and the song were then very <lb/>
            simple. In process of time the performance became elaborate, and then it fell into <lb/>
            the hands of a small body of persons expressly trained for the purpose, the mass of <lb/>
            the people being spectators. A great number of poets, composing for these trained <lb/>
            bands, sprang up in Argos, Sicyon, and other parts of Peloponnesus, all of whom <lb/>
            wrote in the Doric dialect. Before the time of Stesichorus the chorus consisted of <lb/>
            a uniform stanza. That poet however, who was born at Himera in Sicily, and <lb/>
            flourished in the early part of the sixth century, invented the triple division of <lb/>
            Strophe, Antistrophe, and Epode, which made the chorus more complicated and <lb/>
            more difficult of execution. He is reported to have acquired the name of Stesichorus <lb/>
            from the innovation which he introduced, his original name having been Tisias. <lb/>
            Pindar and Simonides, who were contemporaries of Æschylus, carried lyric poetry <lb/>
            to the highest degree of perfection. See Grote's History of Greece, vol. iv. <lb/>

            courses at some length upon this; and the reader will not be <lb/>
            displeased if I present him with a brief extract, (taken from vol. ii. <lb/>
            page 14):</p>
          <p>" We have remarked the more familiar acquaintance with the <lb/>
            poems of Homer which resulted from the labours and example of <lb/>
            Pisistratus. This event combined with other causes to create with <lb/>
            apparent suddenness, amongst a susceptible and lively population, <lb/>
            a general cultivation of taste. The citizens were brought together in <lb/>
            their hours of relaxation by the urbane and social manner of life <lb/>
            under porticos and in gardens, which it was the policy of a graceful <lb/>
            and benignant tyrant to inculcate: and the native genius, hitherto <lb/>
            dormant, of the quick Ionian race, once awakened to literary and <lb/>
            intellectual objects, created an audience even before it found ex­ <lb/>
            pression in a poet. The elegant effeminacy of Hipparchus contributed <lb/>
            to foster the taste of the people-for the example of the great is <lb/>
            nowhere more potent over the multitude than in the cultivation of <lb/>
            the arts. Patronage may not produce poets, but it multiplies critics. <lb/>
            Anacreon and Simonides, introduced amongst the Athenians by Hip­ <lb/>
            parchus, and enjoying his friendship, no doubt added largely to the <lb/>
            influence which poetry began to assume. The peculiar sweetness of <lb/>
            those poets imbued with harmonious contagion the genius of the first <lb/>
            of the Athenian dramatists, whose works are lost to us, though <lb/>
            evidence of their character is preserved. About the same time the <lb/>
            Athenians must necessarily have been made more intimately ac­ <lb/>
            quainted with the Lyric poets of Ionia and the isles. Thus it hap­ <lb/>
            pened that their models in poetry were of two kinds, the Epic and <lb/>
            the Lyric, and in the natural connexion of art it was but the next <lb/>
            step to accomplish a species of poetry which should attempt to unite <lb/>
            the two. Happily at this time Athens possessed a man of true <lb/>
            genius, whose attention early circumstances had directed to a rude <lb/>
            and primitive order of histrionic recitation :—Phrynichus the poet <lb/>
            was a disciple of Thespis the mime: to him belongs this honour, that <lb/>
            out of the elements of the broadest Farce he conceived the first grand <lb/>
            combinations of the Tragic Drama.</p>
          <p>" From time immemorial, as far back perhaps as the grove possessed <lb/>
            an altar and the waters supplied a reed for the pastoral pipe, Poetry <lb/>
            and Music had been dedicated to the worship of the Gods of Greece. <lb/>
            At the appointed season of festival to each several Deity, his praises <lb/>
             <pb n="314"/>
            were sung, his traditionary achievements were recited. One of the <lb/>
            divinities last introduced into Greece, the mystic and enigmatical <lb/>
            Dionysos or Bacchus, received the popular and enthusiastic adoration <lb/>
            naturally due to the God of the vineyard and the Unbinder of galling <lb/>
            cares. Dithyrambs, or wild and exulting songs, at first extempora­ <lb/>
            neous, celebrated the triumphs of the God. By degrees the rude <lb/>
            hymn swelled into prepared and artful measures, performed by a <lb/>
            chorus that danced circling round the altar; and the Dithyramb <lb/>
            assumed a lofty and solemn strain adapted to the sanctity of sacrifice <lb/>
            and the emblematic majesty of the God. These ceremonial songs <lb/>
            received a wanton and wild addition, as, in order perhaps more closely <lb/>
            to represent and personify the motley march of the Liber Pater, the <lb/>
            chorus-singers borrowed from the vine-browsing goat, which they <lb/>
            sacrificed, the hides and horns which furnished forth the merry <lb/>
            mimicry of the Satyr and the Faun. Under licence of this disguise <lb/>
            the songs became more obscene and grotesque, and the mummers <lb/>
            vied with each other in obtaining the applause of the rural audience <lb/>
            by wild buffoonery and unrestricted jest. Whether as the prize of <lb/>
            the winner or as the object of sacrifice, the goat was a sufficiently <lb/>
            important personage to bestow upon the exhibition the homely name <lb/>
            of Tragedy, or Goat-song, destined afterwards to be exalted by asso­ <lb/>
            ciation with the proudest efforts of human genius. And while the <lb/>
            Dithyramb, yet amidst the Dorian tribes, retained the fire and dignity <lb/>
            of its hereditary character; while in Sicyon it rose in stately and <lb/>
            mournful measures to the memory of Adrastus the Argive hero; while <lb/>
            in Corinth, under the polished rule of Periander, Arion imparted to <lb/>
            the antique hymn a new character and a more scientific music, gra­ <lb/>
            dually in Attica it gave way before the familiar and fantastic humours <lb/>
            of the Satyrs, sometimes abridged to afford greater scope to their <lb/>
            exhibitions, sometimes contracting the contagion of their burlesque. <lb/>
            Still however the reader will observe that the Tragedy or Goat-song <lb/>
            consisted of two parts, first the exhibition of the mummers, and <lb/>
            secondly the Dithyrambic chorus moving in a circle round the altar <lb/>
            of Bacchus. It appears on the whole most probable, though it is a <lb/>
            question of dispute and uncertainty, that not only this festive cere­ <lb/>
            monial, but also its ancient name of Tragedy, had long been familiar in <lb/>
            Attica, when, about B.C. 535, a skilful and ingenious native of Icaria, <lb/>
            an Attic village in which the Bacchic rites were celebrated with <lb/>
            peculiar care, surpassed all competitors in the exhibition of these <lb/>
            rustic entertainments. He relieved the monotonous pleasantries of <lb/>
            the Satyric chorus by introducing, usually in his own person, an <lb/>
            histrionic tale-teller, who from an elevated platform, and with the <lb/>
            lively gesticulations common still to the popular narrators of romance <lb/>
            on the mole of Naples or in the bazaars of the East, entertained the <lb/>
            audience with some mythological legend. It was so clear that during <lb/>
            this recital the chorus remained unnecessarily idle and superfluous, <lb/>
            that the next improvement was as natural in itself as it was important <lb/>
             <pb n="315"/>
            in its consequences. This was to make the chorus assist the narrator <lb/>
            by occasional question or remark.</p>
          <p>" The choruses themselves were improved in their professional art <lb/>
            by Thespis. He invented dances, which for centuries retained their <lb/>
            popularity on the stage, and is said to have given histrionic disguise <lb/>
            to his reciter, at first by the application of pigments to the face, and <lb/>
            afterwards by the construction of a rude linen mask.</p>
          <p>These improvements, chiefly mechanical, form the boundary to <lb/>
            the achievements of Thespis. He did much to create a stage, little <lb/>
            to create tragedy in the proper acceptation of the word. His per­ <lb/>
            formances were still of a ludicrous and homely character, and much <lb/>
            more akin to the comic than the tragic. Of that which makes the <lb/>
            essence of the solemn drama of Athens, its stately plot, its gigantic <lb/>
            images, its prodigal and sumptuous poetry, Thespis was not in any <lb/>
            way the inventor. But Phrynichus, the disciple of Thespis, was a <lb/>
            poet; he saw, though perhaps dimly and imperfectly, the new career <lb/>
            opened to the art; and he may be said to have breathed the immortal <lb/>
            spirit into the mere mechanical forms, when he introduced poetry <lb/>
            into the bursts of the chorus and the monologue of the actor. What­ <lb/>
            ever else Phrynichus effected is uncertain. The developed plot, the <lb/>
            introduction of a regular dialogue through the medium of a second <lb/>
            actor, the pomp and circumstance, the symmetry and climax of the <lb/>
            drama, do not appear to have appertained to his earlier efforts; and <lb/>
            the great artistical improvements which raised the simple incident to <lb/>
            an elaborate structure of depicted narrative and awful catastrophe <lb/>
            are ascribed not to Phrynichus, but to Æschylus. If the later works <lb/>
            of Phrynichus betrayed these excellencies, it is because Æschylus had <lb/>
            then become his rival, and he caught the heavenly light from the new <lb/>
            star which was destined to eclipse him. But everything essential was <lb/>
            done for the Athenian tragedy when Phrynichus took it from the <lb/>
            Satyr, and placed it under the protection of the Muse; when, for­ <lb/>
            saking the humours of the rustic farce, he selected a solemn subject <lb/>
            from the serious legends of the most vivid of all mythologies; when <lb/>
            he breathed into the familiar measures of the chorus the grandeur <lb/>
            and sweetness of the lyric ode; when, in a word, taking nothing from <lb/>
            Thespis but the stage and the performers, he borrowed his tale from <lb/>
            Homer and his melody from Anacreon. We must not then suppose, <lb/>
            misled by the vulgar accounts of the Athenian drama, that the con­ <lb/>
            test for the goat and the buffooneries of Thespis were its real origin: <lb/>
            born of the epic and the lyric song, Homer gave it character, and the <lb/>
            lyrists language. Thespis and his predecessors only suggested the <lb/>
            form to which the new-born poetry should be applied."</p>
          <p>Comedy was evolved from the Phallic chorus much in the same <lb/>
            way that Tragedy was from the Dithyrambic. Wherever the worship <lb/>
            of Bacchus was carried, it was accompanied with both these kinds of <lb/>
            hymns. Each of them was merry and joyous; but while the Dithy­ <lb/>
            rambic united enthusiasm with merriment, the Phallic was of a gross <lb/>
             <pb n="316"/>
            description; for, as the name itself denotes, the singers carried the <lb/>
            Phallus about with them, and their song, whose themes were the <lb/>
            loves and loose adventures of the son of Semele, was accompanied <lb/>
            with motions and gesticulations appropriate to the subject. They at <lb/>
            the same time diverted the company with that coarse jesting and <lb/>
            bantering which had become the regular usage of the festival. It <lb/>
            was in the villages that these Phallic hymns were most popular, <lb/>
            while the Dithyramb was the favourite in towns and cities, where it <lb/>
            became refined and elevated, as before mentioned.</p>
          <p>The district of Icaria, the same where Thespis made his first rude <lb/>
            essays in tragedy, about forty years before his time witnessed an <lb/>
            attempt to dramatise the Phallic mummeries: nor is it unlikely that <lb/>
            this gave the first idea of tragic drama; for the difference between <lb/>
            tragic and comic performance was but slight originally. One Susarion, <lb/>
            a native of Megara, in which country amusements of this kind had <lb/>
            been practised some time before, brought his Phallic chorus to the <lb/>
            Attic village; where, being mounted in a wagon, the leading chorister, <lb/>
            perhaps the author himself, performed a laughable farce much in the <lb/>
            fashion of our merryandrews. The experiment was repeated: it <lb/>
            became customary to prepare little farcical pieces to be acted at the <lb/>
            festival, and a basket of figs and a cask of wine were given for the <lb/>
            prize. As the performance took place during the interval of the <lb/>
            Phallic hymn, it got the name of Comœdia, the Song of the Mummers, <lb/>
            or, according to the derivation adopted by Bentley, Village-Song. <lb/>
            And because the actor smeared his face with lees of wine, it was <lb/>
            sometimes called Trugodia.1</p>
          <p>The farces of Susarion, like the tragedies of Thespis, were mere <lb/>
            ephemeral productions, not given to writing. They were too coarse and <lb/>
            licentious to be encouraged in the city of Athens, while governed by <lb/>
            its ancient aristocracy: and much less would they have suited the <lb/>
            grave policy of Solon or Pisistratus. Comedy therefore was for a great <lb/>
            many years left to exhibit itself in its rude form to the Attic peasants. <lb/>
            Meanwhile it was developed in Sicily by the genius of Phormis and <lb/>
            Epicharmus; the latter of whom is said to have been its inventor, <lb/>
            because he was the first person whose pieces were ever given to the <lb/>
            world in writing.2 He was a native of Cos, from which he was <lb/>
            removed in early infancy to Megara, where he probably learned the <note type="footnote"> (1) Athenaeus, ii. 40. Aristophanes, Acharn. 496.— </note> <figure type="illustration">

              art of dramatic composition. He afterwards lived at Syracuse, under <lb/>
              the protection of Hiero, and acquired fame by his burlesques of the <lb/>
              ancient mythology, and by caricaturing the manners of the day. <lb/>
              The Pythagorean philosophers were ridiculed by him upon the stage. <lb/>
              Comedy appears to have succeeded very well in Sicily, the people of <lb/>
              which were always of a lively and facetious turn. Both humour <lb/>
              itself and the faculty of enjoying it are natural gifts: and Cicero, <lb/>
              who had had opportunities of studying the Sicilian character, speaks <lb/>
              of the people to this effect: (De Oratore, II. 54.)</p>
          <p>" Suavis autem est, et vehementer sæpe utilis jocus et facetiæ : <lb/>

          <p>Nearly a century after the first appearance of Susarion in Attica, <lb/>
            when democracy had been firmly established by the Clisthenean insti­ <lb/>
            tutions, the broad Megarian farce was introduced at Athens. Chio. <lb/>
            nides is mentioned as having been the earliest of the composers. He <lb/>
            was followed by Magnes and some others, of whom we know nothing <lb/>
            beyond their names. At length in the age of Pericles that extraor­ <lb/>
            dinary kind of drama, which is called the Old Attic Comedy, was <lb/>
            gradually raised to its highest perfection under the hands of Crates, <lb/>
            Cratinus, Eupolis, and Aristophanes.</p>
          <p>The plays of this comedy are said to have been three hundred <lb/>
            and sixty-five in number. Eleven plays of Aristophanes and frag­ <lb/>
            ments of his contemporaries have been handed down to us: quite <lb/>
            enough remains to enable us to judge of its character. It was an <lb/>
            entertainment completely in harmony with the drunken festivities <lb/>
            of the Dionysian carnival. The licence enjoyed by the mummers and <lb/>
            merryandrews of the vintage was transferred in the fullest possible <lb/>
            manner to the poet who diverted the assembled people in the state- <lb/>
            theatre of Athens. What the Athenians called comedy, we should <lb/>
            rather call broad farce and extravaganza; and even such names would <lb/>
            give us no idea of what it was. Its plots were the wildest and most <lb/>
            eccentric fictions; its scenes, incidents, and language were not merely <lb/>
            gross and indecent, but (as we should consider) blasphemous; and <lb/>
            yet all was sanctioned by the privilege of the festival. Ridicule both <lb/>
            of Bacchus and his fellow-deities was consistent with the intention to <lb/>
             <pb n="318"/>
            do him honour. If such liberties might be taken with the Gods, <lb/>
            mortals were not likely to escape. It was on the comic stage that <lb/>
            democracy indulged in the most unbounded freedom, allowing any <lb/>
            citizen, rich or poor, high or low, to be attacked and assailed, either <lb/>
            in his public or private character, with impunity. Unlike the Tragic <lb/>
            and Satyric drama, which took their plots generally from legends of <lb/>
            olden time, Comedy chose for her subjects the topics and events of <lb/>
            everyday life, the actions and characters of people who were familiarly <lb/>
            known to the audience. And not only did she hold up to ridicule the <lb/>
            vices and follies of private life, but even the conduct of public men <lb/>
            and their acts of administration. Those statesmen to whom the poet <lb/>
            was opposed in politics fell chiefly under his lash, as might be <lb/>
            expected. His animadversions were an extraordinary admixture of <lb/>
            truth and seriousness with scurrility and absurdity. In short, the <lb/>
            comedian was the great censor and satirist of the day, uniting in <lb/>
            himself the functions of the pantomimic droll, the fool of the Middle <lb/>
            Ages, the journal and Charivari of our own time. Democracy herself <lb/>
            was not safe from the assaults of her indulged children. In the <lb/>
            Demus of Aristophanes the Athenian people were amused to behold <lb/>
            an impersonation of themselves. And what wonder? If Bacchus <lb/>
            could endure to be laughed at upon his own stage, why should his <lb/>
            votaries be more particular ?</p>
          <p>That the leading politicians of Athens occasionally winced under <lb/>
            the castigations of the comedian, is not to be doubted. Pericles <lb/>
            himself, with all his integrity and magnanimity, must have keenly felt <lb/>
            the stinging blows of Cratinus. We know that Cleon was greatly <lb/>
            exasperated by the Babylonians of Aristophanes; who however was <lb/>
            not deterred from bringing him on the stage yet more offensively in <lb/>
            his play of the Knights. In the year B. C. 440, when Pericles was <lb/>
            at the height of his power, a law was passed to prohibit comic per­ <lb/>
            formance ; but this after two or three years was repealed. One or <lb/>
            two more attempts were made to restrain it, but did not succeed. <lb/>
            With the exception of a short period during the interregnum of <lb/>
            B.C. 411, the Old Comedy continued in the exercise of its full liberty <lb/>
            until the close of the Peloponnesian war.</p>
          <p>After the expulsion of the Thirty Tyrants, however, it was replaced <lb/>
            by one of a less licentious kind, which has received the name of the <lb/>
            Middle Comedy, because it was a transition from the coarseness of an. <lb/>
            early age to the refinement of a later. The spirit of the Athenian <lb/>
            people did not then seek the wild excitement, or tolerate the intem­ <lb/>
            perate freedom, of the days of Pericles: and the comedian, instead of <lb/>
            bringing public characters upon the stage and indulging in gross and <lb/>
            open personalities, contented himself with a more disguised censor­ <lb/>
            ship, with satire of a more general nature, with literary criticism and <lb/>
            parody. There was no lack of poets under this regime. Athenæus <lb/>
            tells us (viii. 336.) that he had read upwards of eight hundred plays <lb/>
            of the Middle Comedy. The most celebrated writers of it were <lb/>
             <pb n="319"/>
            Antiphanes and Alexis. It lasted till the overthrow of Athenian <lb/>
            independence at Chæronea.</p>
          <p>To this succeeded the New Comedy, which, quitting entirely the <lb/>
            regions of personal satire and caricature, applied itself (like that of <lb/>
            the present day) to the invention of amusing plots, in which nature <lb/>
            and real life were imitated, but the persons and the incidents were <lb/>
            always fictitious. Between such plays and the Aristophanic there is <lb/>
            a much greater difference than between genteel comedy and farce. <lb/>
            The principal comedians of this last period, which lasted less than <lb/>
            a century, were Menander, Philemon, and Diphilus. Fragments of <lb/>
            them only remain: but we can form a good idea of their style from <lb/>
            the plays of Plautus and Terence, especially those of the latter, which <lb/>
            are translations of Menander.</p>
          <p>Horace, who disliked anything approaching to broad farce or scur­ <lb/>
            rility, condemns the licentiousness of the Aristophanic drama, while <lb/>
            he applauds the talents and vigour of the writers.</p>

          <p>To discuss the merits and demerits of Aristophanes and his con­ <lb/>
            temporaries would lead us too far; but we may take a glance at what <lb/>
            Mitchell says upon the matter in the preliminary discourse to his <lb/>
            translation:</p>
          <p>" The Old Comedy, as it is called, in contradistinction to what was <lb/>
            afterwards named the Middle and the New, stood in the extreme <lb/>
            relation of contrariety and parody to the tragedy of the Greeks-it <lb/>
            was directed chiefly to the lower orders of society at Athens; <lb/>
            it served in some measure the purposes of the modem journal, in <lb/>
            which public measures and the topics of the day might be folly dis­ <lb/>
            cussed ; and in consequence the dramatic personæ were generally the <lb/>
            poet's own contemporaries, speaking in their own names and acting <lb/>
            in masks, which, as they bore only a caricature resemblance of their, <lb/>
            own faces, showed that the poet, in his observations upon them, did <lb/>
            not mean to be taken literally to his expression. Like tragedy, it <lb/>
            constituted part of a religious ceremony; and the character of the <lb/>
            Deity to whom it was more particularly dedicated was stamped at <lb/>
            times pretty visibly upon the work which was composed in his honour. <lb/>
            The Dionysian festivals were the great carnivals of antiquity—they <lb/>
            celebrated the returns of vernal festivity or the joyous vintage, and <lb/>
            were in consequence the great holidays of Athens-the seasons of <lb/>
            universal relaxation. The comic poet was the high priest of the fes­ <lb/>
             <pb n="320"/>
            tival; and if the orgies of his Divinity (the God of wine) sometimes <lb/>
            demanded a style of poetry which a Father of our Church probably <lb/>
            had in his eye when he called all poetry the devil's wine, the organ of <lb/>
            their utterance (however strange it may seem to us) no doubt con­ <lb/>
            sidered himself as perfectly absolved from the censure which we <lb/>
            should bestow on such productions: in their composition he was dis­ <lb/>
            charging the same pious office as the painter, whose duty it was to <lb/>
            fill the temples of the same Deity with pictures which our imagina­ <lb/>
            tions would consider equally ill-suited to the habitations of Divinity. <lb/>
            What religion therefore forbids among us, the religion of the Greeks <lb/>
            did not merely tolerate, but enjoin. Nor was the extreme and even <lb/>
            profane gaiety of the Old Comedy without its excuse. To unite <lb/>
            extravagant mirth with a solemn seriousness was enjoined by law <lb/>
            even in the sacred festival of Ceres. The feast of Bacchus retained <lb/>
            the licence without the embarrassment of the restraint. While the <lb/>
            philosophers therefore querulously maintained that man was the joke <lb/>
            and plaything of the Gods, the comic poet reversed the picture, and <lb/>
            made the Gods the plaything of men: in his hands indeed everything <lb/>
            was upon the broad grin; the Gods laughed, men laughed, animals <lb/>
            laughed. Nature was considered as a sort of fantastic being, with a <lb/>
            turn for the humorous, and the world was treated as a sort of <lb/>
            extended jest-book, where the poet pointed out the bon-mots, and <lb/>
            acted in some degree as corrector of the press. If he discharged this <lb/>
            office sometimes in the sarcastic spirit of a Mephistophiles, this too <lb/>
            was considered as part of his functions. He was the Terræ Filius of <lb/>
            the day, and lenity would have been considered not as an act of dis­ <lb/>
            cretion, but as a cowardly dereliction of duty.</p>
          <p>" Of the species of comedy thus described, whoever was the in­ <lb/>
            ventor, whether Epicharmus or Phormis, Aristophanes was the great <lb/>
            finisher and perfecter. With an ear tuned to the nicest modulations <lb/>
            of harmony, and with a temperament apparently most joyous and <lb/>
            joyful, he was just fitted for the entertainment of a people, of whom <lb/>
            Philip of Macedon, when he compared them to the Hermaic statues <lb/>
            so common in their streets, drew in a few words one of the most <lb/>
            happy and characteristic descriptions of a people which is upon <lb/>
            record. That gaiety which is so well adapted to a nation of quick <lb/>
            natural parts, and which has so few charms for persons of cultivated <lb/>
            understandings, the gaiety which consists in painting pleasantly the <lb/>
            dulness of the understanding (la betise) and in inspiring buffoonery; <lb/>
            of that gaiety, which has been made equally the basis of Italian and <lb/>
            Grecian comedy, Aristophanes was preeminently the master. Music, <lb/>
            dancing, metre, decoratIon-all that union of amusement which the <lb/>
            Greeks, a seeing and not a reading public, (this fact cannot be too <lb/>
            much in our minds when we are talking of their dramatic literature,) <lb/>
            required of their writers for the stage—Aristophanes seemed to have <lb/>
            improved: the Muse of comedy herself he left as he found her, a <lb/>
            beautiful Titania, matchless in her outward proportions, but with <lb/>
             <pb n="321"/>
            a spell upon her affections, and showering favours, which should <lb/>
            have been better bestowed, upon an ass's head with Bottom the <lb/>
            weaver below it."</p>
          <p>It remains only to give an account of the theatre itself and its <lb/>
            arrangements.</p>
          <p>For a long time a wooden theatre, erected only for the time of the <lb/>
            festival, was sufficient for the Athenian drama. At length in the <lb/>
            year B.C. 500, when AEschylus exhibited his first tragedy, the building <lb/>
            overloaded with spectators broke down. It was then resolved to <lb/>
            build a theatre of stone. The rock of the Acropolis was made use of <lb/>
            for that purpose. Under its southern wall, at the eastern extremity, <lb/>
            tiers of seats rising one above another were scooped into the rock. <lb/>
            Each tier formed a large segment of a circle, the diameter increasing <lb/>
            with the ascent. These tiers of seats, with stairs and passages for <lb/>
            convenient access, formed that portion of the theatre which was occu­ <lb/>
            pied by the spectators, and was, according to a less comprehensive <lb/>
            meaning of the term, called the theatre.</p>
          <p>The circular area in the centre, which lay a little below the lowest <lb/>
            tier of benches, was called the Orchestra. It was the floor upon <lb/>
            which the chorus performed their dances, and for that purpose was <lb/>
            covered over with smooth boards. In the centre was the altar of <lb/>
            Bacchus, called Thymele, which reminded people of the ancient <lb/>
            times, when the dithyramb was performed in a ring round the altar; <lb/>
            though now its principal use was as a platform for musicians and <lb/>
            a prompter to stand upon.</p>
          <p>The stage (Proscenium) was outside of the orchestra, forming the <lb/>
            remainder of the circle of which the orchestra was a segment. It was <lb/>
            elevated a little above it. The background was terminated by the <lb/>
            Scena, the wall or frame upon which the scenery of the drama was <lb/>
            delineated, and which, by the rolling of a curtain underground (not <lb/>
            pulling up, as with us), was exhibited to the spectators. With the <lb/>
            exception of a covered portico over the highest tier of seats, the <lb/>
            whole of this theatre was open to the sky. The acoustic arrange­ <lb/>
            ments are said to have been skilfully contrived.</p>
          <p>The actors entered upon the stage through the Scena by three <lb/>
            different doors, assigned to the different characters. The chorus <lb/>
            advanced into the orchestra by side passages, in files three or five <lb/>
            deep, and arranged themselves so as to be in readiness for the choral <lb/>
            performance: the Coryphæus or leader, who was one of the dramatis <lb/>
            personæ, taking a station not far from the Thymele, from which <lb/>
            he could carry on his part of the dialogue.</p>
          <p>Although we, in reading Athenian tragedies at the present day, are <lb/>
            apt to regard the choral parts with less interest than the dramatic, <lb/>
            especially those dithyrambic-like effusions which have little or nothing <lb/>
            to do with the plot, and although even at Athens the chorus under <lb/>
            AEschylus and his successors had come to hold a comparatively subor­ <lb/>
            dinate place in the drama, yet it still possessed a great charm for the <note type="footnote"> VOL. III. </note> <note type="footnote"> Y </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="322"/>
            Athenian audience, and indeed one fully equal to the drama itself. <lb/>
            Independently of its religious associations, the song of the chorus <lb/>
            was accompanied with music and dancing, both of an elaborate com­ <lb/>
            position. The instruments were the harp and the flute. The dance <lb/>
            was complicated: Attic tragedians had adopted the antistrophic <lb/>
            form of Stesichorus: and, to guide the dancers in their evolutions, <lb/>
            lines were marked on the boarded floor of the orchestra. The differ­ <lb/>
            ence between the styles of tragic and comic dancing was as great as <lb/>
            that between tragedy and comedy themselves. The former (called <lb/>
            Emmeleia) was stately and graceful; the latter (Chordax) was ludi­ <lb/>
            crous and indecent. While the tragic chorus consisted usually of <lb/>
            fifteen, the comic were four-and-twenty. To train these choristers <lb/>
            was by no means the least expensive part of bringing out a play. The <lb/>
            poet had to apply for a chorus to the Archon, and the cost was <lb/>
            defrayed (as we nave seen) by the Choragus. In the middle comedy <lb/>
            the chorus after a time was altogether omitted.</p>
          <p>The wearing of masks by the actors has been already alluded to. <lb/>
            This practice, which was originally derived from the rude disguises of <lb/>
            the mummers, was afterwards continued as a matter of necessity, on <lb/>
            account of the size of the theatre, which made it impossible for the <lb/>
            majority of the spectators to distinguish the natural features. A mask <lb/>
            which enlarged the face remedied this defect. In tragedy there was <lb/>
            an additional reason for adopting the disguise. Its principal cha­ <lb/>
            racters were the Gods and Heroes of the ancient legends, whom it <lb/>
            would hardly have seemed proper to represent on the stage like <lb/>
            ordinary human beings. As the cothurnus elevated the person of the <lb/>
            actor, so the mask gave a superhuman expression to his countenance. <lb/>
            No little skill was applied to the fashioning this important part of the <lb/>
            dramatic costume, and we have seen that AEschylus himself was the <lb/>
            author of improvements in it. The manufacture of masks became a <lb/>
            business: each character, as Apollo, Achilles, a Youth, a Maiden, &amp;c., <lb/>
            had its appropriate mask, which was easily recognized by the people. <lb/>
            There was not the same necessity for disguising the chorus, who were <lb/>
            nearer to the spectators, and were arrayed for dancing rather than <lb/>
            for acting: they therefore generally appeared without masks.</p>
          <p>In the old comedy the masks were often extremely grotesque and <lb/>
            absurd, just as they are in an English pantomime; though for ordinary <lb/>
            personages they were tolerably faithful to life. And instead of the <lb/>
            dignified, cothurnus, the soccus, or slipper of common life, was used to <lb/>
            tread the stage with. Where characters of the day were introduced, <lb/>
            it was desirable to have as good a likeness as possible, either by way <lb/>
            of caricature or otherwise. It is said that, when Aristophanes was <lb/>
            about to exhibit Cleon upon the stage, no artist dared to make his mask, <lb/>
            and no actor would undertake to play the character; the poet was <lb/>
            obliged to perform it himself, and rubbed lees of wine upon his face, <lb/>
            to imitate the flushed and bloated countenance of the demagogue.</p>
          <p>The exact dimensions of the Attic theatre (which was never quite <lb/>
             <pb n="323"/>
            completed till the year B.C. 340) are not known. That it was built <lb/>
            on a large scale as compared with modern playhouses, is beyond <lb/>
            a doubt. It has been supposed to have been capable of holding thirty <lb/>
            thousand persons: though this statement, founded chiefly on certain <lb/>
            passages of Plato and Dicæarchus, has been called in question by <lb/>
            Wordsworth, (Athens and Attica, chapter XIII.,) who alleges that <lb/>
            the site of its ruins gives no idea of its magnitude. At all events <lb/>
            it was large enough to accommodate a large proportion of the people <lb/>
            of Athens. The drama was intended for the multitude, and it was in <lb/>
            accordance with the spirit of the constitution, that every facility <lb/>
            should be afforded for their enjoying the spectacle. In the time of <lb/>
            the old wooden theatre the admission was free to all citizens; but the <lb/>
            crushing for places led to confusion and danger; and after the build­ <lb/>
            ing of the stone theatre it was resolved that a price should be charged <lb/>
            for entrance. This was fixed at two obols, and was received by the <lb/>
            lessee or manager of the theatre, (called Pheatrones or Architecton,) <lb/>
            who for that price undertook to keep it in repair and ready for use. <lb/>
            Pericles afterwards passed a law, that the two obols should be given <lb/>
            to the poorer citizens out of the treasury, and so the admission <lb/>
            became again virtually free. Many who could afford to pay for them­ <lb/>
            selves used to apply for the dole of two obols; but, as a general rule, <lb/>
            the rich paid for their seats, and sometimes gave as much as a <lb/>
            drachm for a seat of a better class. There were certain places re­ <lb/>
            served for official personages and others, as for the Members of the <lb/>
            Council, Archons, Generals, Ambassadors. Any one who took a place <lb/>
            belonging to another might, as we have learned from the Oration <lb/>
            against Midias, be removed by the police. (See ante, p. 124.)</p>
          <p>The plays began at an early hour in the morning, and lasted the <lb/>
            whole of the day. Such was the general eagerness to be present, that <lb/>
            many would come long before the time to secure a good place. Some <lb/>
            indeed, to save their two obols, would take their chance of getting a <lb/>
            seat at a later hour; for after a certain time no money was demanded <lb/>
            for entrance. Those that wished to see the whole performance <lb/>
            brought wine and provisions with them; especially the ladies; for <lb/>
            they were permitted to see tragedies, but not comedies, while boys <lb/>
            were allowed to be present at both. At the Lenæan festival, which <lb/>
            was in the month Gamelion, (January,) the spectators were provided <lb/>
            with cloaks; for, the theatre being roofless, they were exposed both <lb/>
            to wind and rain. The more luxurious brought cushions to sit upon. <lb/>
            Æschines reproaches Demosthenes, because, when he accompanied <lb/>
            the Macedonian ambassadors to the play, he did not neglect this <lb/>
            little addition to their comfort. The conduct of the spectators during <lb/>
            the entertainment, their expressions of approbation and displeasure, <lb/>
            by shouting, clapping, hissing, &amp;c., were pretty much the same as in <lb/>
            our own country, but partook somewhat more of democratic freedom. <lb/>
            Æschines, if we may believe his rival, was pelted not unfrequently <lb/>
            with figs and olives for his bad acting; though this seems to have <note type="footnote"> T2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="324"/>
            been by a provincial audience. (See volume II. p. 97; and, on the <lb/>
            whole subject of theatre-going at Athens, see Becker's Charicles, <lb/>
            Excursus to Scene X.)</p>
          <p>While the performances of an Athenian drama had much that was <lb/>
            in common with our own, there were peculiar causes which made it <lb/>
            a scene of much stronger excitement---such as the festive occasion, <lb/>
            the national character of the exhibition, the constant appeal to the <lb/>
            popular sentiment of religion and patriotism. The very fact of the <lb/>
            people sitting under the open sky, while it exposed them to some incon. <lb/>
            vemence, was attended also with advantages; as Wordsworth has well <lb/>
            pointed out in the chapter of his Athens and Attica last referred to.</p>
          <p>" Whatever its capacity might have been, the Theatre of Athens <lb/>
            did not mainly depend on its dimensions for the attractions which it <lb/>
            possessed. Here on this gentle slope, with the Parthenon and the <lb/>
            Acropolis immediately above them, with the valley of the Ilissus not <lb/>
            far beneath, at the beginning of spring, in a transparent atmosphere <lb/>
            beneath a clear sky, with a gentle breeze blowing on them from the <lb/>
            sea, here the spectators sat to be charmed by the mixed enchantments <lb/>
            of nature and art which the Athenian Theatre supplied, both in <lb/>
            exquisite perfection.</p>
          <p>" The dramatic influence of this union, of this interweaving (as it <lb/>
            were) of natural scenery with that of the theatre itself, deserves here <lb/>
            a moment's consideration.</p>
          <p>"It is evident that it furnished the scenic poet with a greater <lb/>
            range of subjects and with greater freedom in treating them. To <lb/>
            one of these poets it gave free scope to his bold conceptions, <lb/>
            and supplied objects for his imagination to deal with. It will <lb/>
            be found, that most of the metaphorical expressions of Æschylus <lb/>
            are derived from objects which were visible to the audience, while <lb/>
            they listened to the recital of those expressions in the theatre. <lb/>
            Seas and storms, building of ships and their navigation, feeding of <lb/>
            flocks on the hills, hunting in the woods, fishing in the sea, walls and <lb/>
            fortifications, the Stadium and its course; these are the usual, the <lb/>
            simple and natural sources from which Æschylus derived his copious <lb/>
            streams of figurative diction. They were all either in the immediate <lb/>
            field of view, or in near connexion with that theatre where the <lb/>
            language they enriched was uttered. They were almost the natural <lb/>
            elements of which the poetical atmosphere of that theatre was com­ <lb/>
            posed : the dramatic poet breathed them as his native air.</p>
          <p>" Similarly Sophocles speaks with a local truth when in the Theatre <lb/>
            at Athens he says of the island of Salamis,1 <lb/>
            O noble Salamis, thou indeed <lb/>
            Buoyed on the wave dost happy dwell <lb/>
            Conspicuous ever in the eyes of men. <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BOHN_19_fig81.jpg"/></figure><note type="footnote"> Ajar, 596. </note> <pb n="325"/>
              </p>
          <p>“The peaked hills of Salamis stood in the western horizon, like a <lb/>
            picture drawn to illustrate the poem with their visible beauty.</p>
          <p>" To Euripides again this combination afforded the most favour­ <lb/>
            able field for expressing the tenets of his own peculiar philosophy. <lb/>
            While Æschylus exulted in the rich variety of natural objects before <lb/>
            him, Euripides laboured to blend them into one : but unless the sky <lb/>
            had been open, and the air free about him, he could never have here <lb/>
            pronounced with the same energy as he did,1 <lb/>
            Seest thou the abyss of sky that hangs above thee, <lb/>
            And clasps the earth around in moist embrace ? <lb/>
            This to be Jove believe, this serve as God. <lb/>
            His creed would have remained a dry theme of abstract speculation, <lb/>
            and never become instinct with the life of poetic sensation.</p>
          <p>" To the dramatic poets of Athens not as inventors merely, but as <lb/>
            addressing an audience for great moral and social purposes, the <lb/>
            position of the theatre gave great advantages. To select one: Being <lb/>
            placed immediately under the Acropolis, being seated (if we may so <lb/>
            say) on the very steps of that great natural temple, for such to <lb/>
            Athenians their Acropolis was, the audience were thus immediately <lb/>
            connected with what was most sacred and beautiful in the Athenian <lb/>
            city. They were themselves almost consecrated by such a union. Just <lb/>
            above them was the Temple of Minerva and the Statue of the Jupiter <lb/>
            of the Citadel.2 They were sitting thus, as the poet expressed it, <lb/>
            under the wings of Gods.3</p>
          <p>" To apply the same observation to another department of dramatic <lb/>
            literature: It is evident that to the peculiar advantages arising from <lb/>
            its position and character, which the Theatre of Athens possessed, <lb/>
            is to be ascribed in a great degree the successful daring of the <lb/>
            Aristophanic plays; To cite instances: How in the confinement of a <lb/>
            modern theatre could we imagine a Trygæus soaring above the sea in <lb/>
            an aerial excursion ? There his journey would be reduced to a mere <lb/>
            mechanical process of ropes and pullies, and would be inexorably <lb/>
            baffled by the resistance of the roof. But in the Athenian Theatre <lb/>
            the sky itself was then visible, whither he was mounting, and in <lb/>
            which he was placed by the simple machinery of the imagination of <lb/>
            the spectators, to which free play was given by the natural properties <lb/>
            of the theatre itself. How again, if pent in by the limits of a modern <lb/>
            theatre, could the birds be imagined to build their aerial city? How <figure type="illustration">

              could the clouds have come sailing on the stage from the heights of a <lb/>
              neighbouring Fames? How in such a position could the future <lb/>
              minister of Athens have surveyed from the stage, as he did, the <lb/>
              natural map of his own future domains, the Agora, the harbours, <lb/>
              the Pnyx, and all the tributary islands lying in a group around him ?</p>
          <p>These conceptions and such as these are characteristic of the genius <lb/>
            of the Athenian drama: on a modern stage they would be forced and <lb/>
            inadmissible: here, under an open sky, with the hills of Athens <lb/>
            around him, and a part of the city beneath him, they would seem to <lb/>
            the spectator to be in some sense the creations of the place, no less <lb/>
            than of the poet himself."</p>

          <p>THE invention of the science of jurisprudence has been attributed <lb/>
            (not without some reason) to the Athemans.1 Considering the anti­ <lb/>
            quity of their laws, we are astonished at their variety and their <lb/>
            excellence. Besides a code of statutes remarkable for the care and. <lb/>
            foresight with which they were drawn up, whether that be due to <lb/>
            Solon alone, or to Solon jointly with succeeding legislators, we find <lb/>
            established in the flourishing period of their republic a complex <lb/>
            iudicial system, with prescribed forms of action and rules of pleading <lb/>
            and practice, so nice and artificial as to remind one of that which our <lb/>
            Norman ancestors, full of forensic subtlety, handed down to us. <lb/>
            Meier, Schömann, Plainer, and other German authors have written <lb/>
            copious treatises on the process of the Athenian courts. Out of the <lb/>
            scanty materials furnished by a few ancient books, they have done <lb/>
            for Attic law what Blackstone, Tidd, and Archbold have for the <lb/>
            English. And to such works I am in great measure indebted for the <lb/>
            brief outline which I present to the reader.</p>
          <p>It will be found convenient to take separately the two great <lb/>
            divisions to which we are accustomed in our own country, of civil law <lb/>
            and criminal. The line of demarcation between them was not indeed <lb/>
            quite the same at Athens as in England: for there were some offences <lb/>
            which, though they are treated as purely criminal with us, might at <lb/>
            Athens be made the subject of civil proceedings, as theft and penury: <lb/>
            again there were some things punishable as crimes at Athens and not <lb/>
            so in England; and vice versa; as might be expected. There was <note type="footnote"> (1) To Athens, says Ælian, mankind were indebted for the olive, the fig, and the <lb/>
            administration of justice; likewise for athletics and chariot-driving. lucar <foreign xml:lang="grc">δου̃ναι <lb/>

            also much in the judicial system of the Athenians that was common <lb/>
            both to civil and criminal charges; and with them, as with us, it <lb/>
            frequently happened that the aggrieved party had the option of pro­ <lb/>
            ceeding either civilly or criminally against the offender. Still the <lb/>
            main distinctions between crime and civil injury, which are founded <lb/>
            on the principles of human society, were observed both in the sta­ <lb/>
            tutory code and the judicial practice of the Athenians.1</p>
          <p>We will begin with the criminal law; noticing the different classes <lb/>
            of offences, the punishments with which they were respectively <lb/>
            visited, the various tribunals before which they were brought, and <lb/>
            the different methods of proceeding.</p>
          <p>As a general rule it may be laid down, that every criminal charge <lb/>
            was tried before a jury taken from the body of the people, and pre­ <lb/>
            sided over by a particular magistrate having cognizance of the <lb/>
            offence. The case of homicide furnishes an exception; in this the <lb/>
            ancient tribunals, which were anterior to the establishment of the <lb/>
            jury system, maintained their jurisdiction. And to this our attention <lb/>
            will first be directed.</p>

          <p>This whole department of crime was anciently under the juris­ <lb/>
            diction of the Areopagus. The court, composed of men taken from <lb/>
            the best families of Attica, was always famous for the justice of its <lb/>
            decisions-so at least the Athenians boasted ;-but, when it passed <lb/>
            sentence of condemnation on the criminal, it had no option but to <lb/>
            punish him with death. Draco2 first mitigated the rigour of this law, <lb/>
            somewhere about the year B. c. 621, by establishing a board of fifty- <lb/>
            one judges, taken from families of high birth, and called Ephetæ, <lb/>
            with power to try cases of accidental or justifiable homicide, and deal <lb/>
            with them on equitable principles.3 Solon, who repealed other ordi- <note type="footnote"> (1) See the reasoning of Demosthenes In the Oration against Midias, ante, pp. 65, <lb/>
            71, 75, 77. 80, 81, 108, 124. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) " Draco did not meddle with the political constitution, and in his ordinances <lb/>
            Aristotle finds little worthy of remark, except the extreme severity of the punish­ <lb/>
            ments awarded: petty thefts or even proved idleness of life being visited with <lb/>
            death or disfranchisement. But we are not to construe this remark as demon­ <lb/>
            strating any special inhumanity in the character of Draco, who was not invested <lb/>
            with the large power which Solon afterwards enjoyed, and cannot be imagined to <lb/>
            have imposed upon the community severe laws of his own invention. Himself of <lb/>
            course an Eupatrid, he set forth in writing such ordinances as the Eupatrid archons <lb/>
            had before been accustomed to enforce without writing in the particular cases which <lb/>
            came before them ; and the general spirit of penal legislation had become so much <lb/>
            milder during the two centuries which followed, that these old ordinances appeared <lb/>
            to Aristotle intolerably rigorous. Probably neither Draco nor the Locrian Zaleucus, <lb/>
            who somewhat preceded him in date, were more rigorous than the sentiment of the <lb/>
            age: indeed the few fragments of the Draconian tables which have reached us, <lb/>
            far from exhibiting indiscriminate cruelty, introduce for the first time into the <lb/>

            nances of Draco, which are said to have been of too severe a charac­ <lb/>
            ter, preserved his regulations in regard to homicide, and did not <lb/>
            disturb the constitution of the Ephetæ, though he remodelled that of <lb/>
            the Areopagus in the manner already mentioned. (Vol. II. Appendix <lb/>
            III.) After Solon's time then the law stood as we find it laid down <lb/>
            in the Oration against Aristocrates. (Ante, p. 174.)</p>
          <p>The Areopagus had cognizance of murder, of wounding with <lb/>
            malicious intent, of arson, and of poisoning.</p>
          <p>Here we may remark that by the terms of the Athenian law murder <lb/>
            and poisoning were distinguished. No such distinction exists in our <lb/>
            law, by which poisoning is treated simply as murder. Yet there was <lb/>
            a time when a difference was made with us. On account of the <lb/>
            detestable nature of the crime of poisoning, a statute was passed in <lb/>
            the reign of Henry VIII., which made it treason, and subjected it <lb/>
            to a painful and lingering punishment, namely, boiling to death: but <lb/>
            the statute was repealed in the first year of Edward VI. (See Black­ <lb/>
            stone's Commentaries, IV. 196.)</p>
          <p>The Areopagites, as all the other judges of homicide, sat in the <lb/>
            open air, to avoid being under the same roof with the criminal. The <lb/>
            King-Archon brought the case into court, and presided with his <lb/>
            crown taken off. The proceedings were conducted with the utmost <lb/>
            solemnity. A solemn oath was taken by the accuser, setting forth his <lb/>
            relationship to the deceased, and imprecating a dreadful curse upon <lb/>
            himself and his family, if the charge were not true.1 The accused <lb/>
            swore to his innocence in like manner; and an oath equally solemn <lb/>
            was taken by the witnesses. Each party was allowed to address the <lb/>
            court twice, and, as it would seem, upon two consecutive days: <lb/>
            anciently they were not allowed the assistance of an advocate, though <lb/>
            in later times this rule was relaxed: and they were required to <lb/>
            confine themselves to the point at issue, and to abstain from all <lb/>
            attempts to excite passion or sympathy. After the first day the <lb/>
            accused was at liberty, if he pleased, to withdraw from his country­ <lb/>
            to this rule parricide was the only exception-nor had the prosecutor <lb/>
            any right to prevent him: but in that case he was condemned to per­ <lb/>
            petual exile, and his property was confiscated. If he abided his <lb/>
            trial, the judges gave their votes by ballot on the third day. A <lb/>
            majority of votes either way decided the verdict, but an equal <lb/>
            number was an acquittal.2 A convicted murderer was sentenced to <lb/>
            death; and he was delivered to the Eleven for execution. The mode <note type="footnote"> ancient law. Others derive it from the active signification of the verb <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐφίημι</foreign>, or <lb/>

              of death was commonly by drinking the juice of hemlock, which was <lb/>
              administered in prison. The prosecutor, as we learn from Demo­ <lb/>
              sthenes (ante, p. 190), had a right to witness the infliction of the <lb/>
              sentence; a provision which was rendered necessary by its secrecy. <lb/>
              Wounding with malicious intent, not followed by death, was punished <lb/>
              with exile and confiscation.</p>
          <p>All minor cases of homicide were confided to the jurisdiction of <lb/>
            the Ephetæ, who sat to try them in one or other of the four courts <lb/>
            of Palladium, Delphinium, Prytaneum, or Phreatto, according to the <lb/>
            nature of the case.1 The respective duties of those courts appear <lb/>
            from the laws quoted by Demosthenes (ante, pp. 190—193), and <lb/>
            need not be repeated here. The sitting in the prytaneum, to pass <lb/>
            sentence upon inanimate things which had caused the death of a man, <lb/>
            was an evidence of the strong belief of the ancient Athenians that <lb/>
            homicide tainted the people among whom it was committed with <lb/>
            a pollution which required to be expiated. This feeling was carried <lb/>
            so far that, where there was no human being guilty, the senseless <lb/>
            instrument of death was ordered to be cast out of the boundaries. <lb/>
            The practice has been compared with our own custom of giving <lb/>
            deodands in the like cases.2 Neither this court nor that in Phreatto, <lb/>
            which was used for cases of very rare occurrence, was at all equal in <lb/>
            importance to the courts of Palladium and Delphinium, in the former <lb/>
            of which cases of accidental homicide, in the latter cases of justifiable <lb/>
            homicide were to be tried.</p>
          <p>The circumstances which made homicide excusable or justifiable <lb/>
            under the Athenian law by no means coincide with those which do so <lb/>
            in the English. Any purely accidental killing, which falls under the <lb/>
            description of homicide by misadventure, is excusable with us: as for <lb/>
            example, if a man is working with a hatchet, and the head flies off <lb/>
            and kills a bystander; or if a man shooting at a bird hits a person <lb/>

            grounded upon this additional reason, that such misfortunes are in part owing to the <lb/>
            negligence of the owner, and therefore he is properly punished by such forfeiture. <lb/>
            A like punishment is in like cases inflicted by the Mosaical law (Exod. xxi. 28); <lb/>
            ' if an ox gore a man that he die, the ox shall be stoned, and his flesh shall not be <lb/>

            a crime in the eye of the law: and for this purpose many acts are <lb/>
            wrongful with us, which were held perfectly innocent by the <lb/>
            Athenians. Thus, to kill a man unintentionally in the gymnastic <lb/>
            games was excusable by the laws of Solon, as we learn from Demo­ <lb/>
            sthenes; but in England one who kills another in a prize-fight is <lb/>
            guilty of manslaughter, because prize-fights are illegal.</p>
          <p>The reader may have noticed, that in translating the Greek <foreign xml:lang="grc">φόνος</foreign> <lb/>
            I have carefully avoided using the term manslaughter. That word, <lb/>
            according to its etymology, should signify nothing more than homi­ <lb/>
            cide; but in the language of the English law it has obtained a <lb/>
            farther meaning, and is defined to be " an unlawful killing without <lb/>
            malice." To constitute this crime, it is not necessary that the act be <lb/>
            voluntary. To kill a man who assaults you in the heat of passion, <lb/>
            and to kill by throwing a stone into a crowded street, may both be <lb/>
            manslaughter, though the character of the two acts, in regard to <lb/>
            intention, was very different. The absence of malice in each prevents <lb/>
            it amounting to murder.</p>
          <p>Killing in self-defence was perfectly justifiable at Athens. In the <lb/>
            English law it is said to be excusable rather than justifiable; while, <lb/>
            on the other hand, it is perfectly justifiable to kill a felon who resists <lb/>
            capture. (Blackstone’s Commentaries, IV. 179, 183.) At the present <lb/>
            day indeed there is no practical difference between the two cases; <lb/>
            for in both the party would be acquitted and exonerated from all <lb/>
            legal liability. In ancient times however a man guilty of excusable <lb/>
            homicide would have incurred forfeiture of his goods, to be disposed <lb/>
            of inpios usus for the benefit of the soul of the deceased. (Ibid.188.) <lb/>
            At Athens there was no precise distinction between what was ex­ <lb/>
            cusable and what was justifiable. There, as with us, in considering <lb/>
            the apology of self-defence, the main question was, whether the <lb/>
            aggressor was slain immediately, so as to exclude the idea of malice <lb/>
            or revenge. (Ante, p. 186.) To kill a man caught in adultery with <lb/>
            your wife, which was justifiable at Athens, is manslaughter in Eng­ <lb/>
            land. (Blackstone, ibid. 181.) Such an excuse, like many others <lb/>
            which among the Greeks would have constituted a good defence to <lb/>
            the charge, is with us taken into account in mitigation of punish­ <lb/>
            ment only.</p>
          <p>Where a person at Athens was convicted of accidental homicide <lb/>
            which was not perfectly excusable, there were two things provided <lb/>
            for by the law; first, the cleansing of the country from pollution, and <lb/>
            secondly, the satisfaction of the deceased man's relations. Here the <lb/>
            old Athenian sentiment was widely different from that of modem <lb/>
            civilised people; among whom there is no idea of any national pollu­ <lb/>
            tion arising from homicide, and all regard to the private wrong is <lb/>
            merged in the desire for public justice. The Athenian law required <lb/>
            the convict to quit the country by a certain appointed route, and to <lb/>
            expiate his crime by certain religious rites: he was to stay abroad for <lb/>
            a year, unless before the expiration of that period he could appease, <lb/>
             <pb n="331"/>
            or make amends to, the relations of the deceased, either by gifts or <lb/>
            by humble submission or otherwise. If the deceased had left no <lb/>
            relatives within a certain degree, he was to appease the members of <lb/>
            his clan in like manner. Meanwhile the relatives and the clansmen <lb/>
            were forbidden to prevent his departure from Athens, or in any way <lb/>
            to molest him during his exile.</p>
          <p>This humane law of the Athenians, which, while it prevented feud <lb/>
            and bloodshed, provided for all due atonement and expiation, bears a <lb/>
            resemblance to the law of Moses, by which cities of refuge were <lb/>
            appointed for those that killed people accidentally, so that under <lb/>
            certain conditions they might be protected from the hand of the <lb/>
            avenger. It will be interesting to compare the Jewish with the <lb/>
            Attic, and with the comments of Demosthenes (ante, pp. 179—181, <lb/>
            191, 192).</p>
          <p>We read in Numbers, chap. XXXV. ver. 11:</p>
          <p>" Then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you; <lb/>
            that the slayer may flee thither, which killeth any person at unawares.</p>
          <p>" And they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger; <lb/>
            that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation in <lb/>
            judgment."</p>
          <p>Ibid. ver. 26:</p>
          <p>“ But if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of <lb/>
            the city of his refuge, whither he was fled;</p>
          <p>" And the revenger of blood find him without the borders of the <lb/>
            city of his refuge, and the revenger of his blood kill the slayer, he <lb/>
            shall not be guilty of blood:</p>
          <p>" Because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until <lb/>
            the death of the high-priest: but after the death of the high-priest <lb/>
            the slayer shall return into the land of his possession."</p>
          <p>Ibid. ver. 31:</p>
          <p>" Moreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer, <lb/>
            which is guilty of death: but he shall surely be put to death.</p>
          <p>" And ye shall take no satisfaction for himthat is fled to the city <lb/>
            of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land, until <lb/>
            the death of the priest.</p>
          <p>" So shall ye not pollute the land wherein ye are: for blood it <lb/>
            defileth the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that <lb/>
            is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it."</p>
          <p>Deuteronomy, chap. xix. ver. 2 :</p>
          <p>" Thou shalt separate three cities for thee in the midst of thy land, <lb/>
            which the Lord thy God giveth thee to possess it.</p>
          <p>“ Thou shalt prepare thee a way, and divide the coasts of thy land, <lb/>
            which the Lord thy God giveth thee to inherit, into three parts, that <lb/>
            every slayer may flee thither.</p>
          <p>" And this is the case of the slayer, which shall flee thither, that he <lb/>
            may live: Whoso killeth his neighbour ignorantly, whom he hateth <lb/>
            not in time past;</p><pb n="332"/>
            
          <p>“ As when a man goeth into the wood with his neighbour to hew <lb/>
            wood, and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the <lb/>
            tree, and the head slippeth from the helve and lighteth upon his <lb/>
            neighbour, that he die; he shall flee unto one of those cities <lb/>
            and live:</p>
          <p>" Lest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer, while his heart <lb/>
            is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and slay him; <lb/>
            whereas he was not worthy of death, inasmuch as he hated him not <lb/>
            in time past."</p>
          <p>Compare Joshua, chap. xx.</p>
          <p>The custom of appeasing the kindred of the deceased may be com. <lb/>
            pared to that, which prevailed among the Teutonic nations, of paying <lb/>
            a fine or composition for homicide to the relations. Such was the <lb/>
            weregild of the Saxons, the assythment of the ancient Scotch, and the <lb/>
            eriach of the old Irish Brehon law. Such fine was payable, whether <lb/>
            the homicide was voluntary or involuntary; for capital punishment <lb/>
            was contrary to the spirit of the Teuton people, who thought the <lb/>
            loss of one citizen ill repaired by the loss of another. While the <lb/>
            Athenian law imposed only a general obligation to satisfy the rela­ <lb/>
            tions, leaving it to them to agree as to the terms, the Teutonic code <lb/>
            determined the rate at which the composition was to be paid, which <lb/>
            varied according to the rank and condition of the party. In the <lb/>
            Saxon law, the weregilds were established in progressive order, from <lb/>
            the death of the ceorl, or peasant, to that of the king. For a ceorl <lb/>
            it was 266 thrysmas, or shillings; for the king, 30,000. By the <lb/>
            Salic, the composition for the murder of a bishop was 900 solidi; for <lb/>
            that of a priest, 600. And the Franks made a marked difference <lb/>
            between the races of the conquerors and the conquered. Thus a fine <lb/>
            of 200 solidi was paid for a common Frank, while only 100 was paid <lb/>
            for a Roman possessor of lands, and 45 for a tributary. (Montesquieu, <lb/>
            Esprit des Loix, lib. xxviii. chap. 3; Hallam's Middle Ages, vol. I. <lb/>
            p. 147; Blackstone’s Commentaries, IV. 313.) Tacitus notices the <lb/>
            custom in his treatise De Moribus Germanorum, c. 21:—" Luitur <lb/>
            homicidium certo armentorum ac pecorum numero; recipitque satis­ <lb/>
            factionem universa domus." The last relic in our own law of the <lb/>
            doctrine, that homicide was a private wrong, was the appeal of <lb/>
            murder, which, after having for centuries been obsolete, was abolished <lb/>
            by the statute 59 George III.1</p>
          <p>But how was it determined, to which of the different courts any <lb/>
            particular case of homicide appertained? Whether the act was wilful, <lb/>
            or accidental, or justifiable, were questions to be decided by evidence, <lb/>
            and must have been in some measure inquired into before the accused <note type="footnote"> (1) The statute was passed in consequence of the appeal-of William Ashford against <lb/>
            Abraham Thornton, for the alleged murder of his sister Mary Ashford at Button <lb/>
            Cold field in Warwickshire in the year 1817. Thornton was tried upon an indictment <lb/>
            for the murder and acquitted. The appeal was afterwards brought, but led to nothing, <lb/>
            Ashford declining the wager of battle. The proceedings are reported in the first <lb/>

            party could be sent to his proper tribunal. It was the business of <lb/>
            the King-Archon to determine this point. To him belonged the <lb/>
            instructio litis. The charge having been preferred to him, he sum­ <lb/>
            moned the parties, and heard the evidence privately. Three months <lb/>
            were allowed for this preliminary inquiry, and at least one hearing <lb/>
            was appointed for each month. In the fourth he brought the case <lb/>
            before that tribunal, which from the evidence he considered the proper <lb/>
            one to try it. The accused however, if dissatisfied with the King- <lb/>
            Archon's decision, might still contend that his case appertained to one <lb/>
            of the minor courts, and, in order to raise the question, might put in <lb/>
            a plea to the jurisdiction. Thus, if he were sent to the Areopagus, <lb/>
            he might plead that his act of homicide was justifiable, and that he <lb/>
            ought to be tried in the court of Delphinium. If the judges took <lb/>
            the same view, we must presume that they referred the cause to the <lb/>
            inferior court.1</p>
          <p>Whilst this previous inquiry was pending, the accused was com­ <lb/>
            pelled to absent himself from the market and most other public <lb/>
            places, and especially from the temples and sacrifices. A notice to <lb/>
            this effect was given at the funeral of the deceased by the party <lb/>
            intending to prosecute; and the warning was repeated by the King- <lb/>
            Archon.</p>
          <p>The task of prosecution devolved upon the nearest relative of the <lb/>
            deceased. To perform this task was his duty as well as his privilege; <lb/>
            and one who neglected it, if within the degree of a first cousins son, <lb/>
            was held to be guilty of impiety.2 Where the deceased had forgiven <lb/>
            his murderer before he died, the relations might without any crime <lb/>
            forbear to prosecute; and in cases of accidental homicide they were <lb/>
            absolved from the necessity of so doing by the giving of legal satis­ <lb/>
            faction, unless the deceased had charged them to prosecuted The <note type="footnote"> (1) On the whole of this subject, see my article <foreign xml:lang="grc">φόνος</foreign> in the Archaeological Dic­ <lb/>

              master prosecuted for the murder of his slave; the patron for his <lb/>
              freedman.</p>
          <p>The proceedings upon the trial of homicide in the inferior courts, <lb/>
            so far as regards the speeches of the parties, the oaths, and other <lb/>
            formalities, were much the same as those in the court of Areopagus. <lb/>
            The great point of distinction was, that they were incompetent to <lb/>
            pass a capital sentence. In later times it appears from certain <lb/>
            passages m the orators, (see Schömann, Antiq. Jur. Publ. p. 295), <lb/>
            that causes were tried in those courts by a jury taken from the body <lb/>
            of the people, and not by the Ephetæ. Whether the business of <lb/>
            those functionaries was entirely superseded or not, we cannot deter­ <lb/>
            mine. It is probable, that for important causes the common method <lb/>
            of trial by jury was preferred; while the Ephetæ were still employed <lb/>
            in those rare or less important cases which were referred to the courts <lb/>
            of Prytaneum and Phreatto. There is a particular offence mentioned <lb/>
            in the Oration against Aristocrates, (ante, p. 178,) the cognizance of <lb/>
            which was given by the ancient law to the Ephetæ. This was, where <lb/>
            a man slew a murderer, who had fled from the country and kept him­ <lb/>
            self aloof from the interdicted places: the person violating the pro­ <lb/>
            tection accorded in such case to the murderer was to be tried by the <lb/>
            Ephetæ. Another duty imposed on them, of a formal nature, is <lb/>
            mentioned in the Oration against Macartatus (p. 1069): where a <lb/>
            person killed accidentally had left no relations within the required <lb/>
            degrees, the Ephetæ were to choose ten persons among his clansmen, <lb/>
            to settle terms of reconciliation with the slayer. Duties such as <lb/>
            these it is very likely they retained.</p>
          <p>We have orations on the subject of homicide left us by Antiphon <lb/>
            and Lysias. The three Tetralogies of Antiphon are rhetorical <lb/>
            exercises, in which he gives us two imaginary speeches on both <lb/>
            sides.</p>
          <p>The first is a charge of murder. A man returning from a supper <lb/>
            is found murdered together with his slave. An enemy is accused of <lb/>
            the deed. The proofs adduced against him are all circumstantial, <lb/>
            except the hearsay evidence of the slave, who declared in his dying <lb/>
            moments that he recognized the defendant's person. It is objected, <lb/>
            that no slave could give evidence except under the torture; to which <lb/>
            the prosecutor replies that the ordinary rule was not applicable to the <lb/>
            case of a man dying. The defendant proposes to prove an alibi, <lb/>
            offering his slaves to be examined by torture, and suggesting that the <lb/>
            night of the murder was a remarkable one, being on the festival of the <lb/>
            Diipolia.</p>
          <p>The second is a case of homicide by misadventure. Two youths <lb/>
            "were practising with javelins in the gymnastic school. One acci­ <lb/>
            dentally kills the other, and is prosecuted by his father. His own <lb/>
            father defends him, and asserts that the deceased was entirely to <lb/>
            blame for running in the way of the target.</p>
          <p>The third is a case which in England might have been manslaughter. <lb/>
             <pb n="335"/>
            An old and a young man quarrel and come to blows. The young <lb/>
            man kills the old, and is charged with murder. His defence is that <lb/>
            the deceased gave the first blow, that he struck him in self-defence, <lb/>
            and with his fist only; that the death took place many days after, and <lb/>
            was caused by unskilful medical treatment.1</p>
          <p>There is a speech by Antiphon (the first in Bekker's edition), com­ <lb/>
            posed for a client, charging his stepmother with having poisoned his <lb/>
            father. Very little proof is offered. The chief point of suspicion is, <lb/>
            that she refused to give up her slaves to the question.</p>
          <p>The defence written for the choragus, who was charged with having <lb/>
            poisoned a chorister, must have been spoken in one of the inferior <lb/>
            courts, probably the Palladium. For, though the chorister actually <lb/>
            died of the poison, the charge is limited to the murderous design, <lb/>
            of which offence the Palladium had cognizance equally with the <lb/>
            Areopagus.2</p>
          <p>The Oration Be Cæde Herodis is the defence of a man charged with <lb/>
            murder, but this charge seems to have been combined with others of <lb/>
            conspiracy and robbery, so that the defendant was not proceeded <lb/>
            against in the ordinary way, but had an information laid against him <lb/>
            as a malefactor, and was tried by a popular jury. The facts were these. <lb/>
            He had sailed in the same vessel with Herodes, bound for Ænus. <note type="footnote"> (1) Questions of this sort frequently arise in our courts, how far the death of a <lb/>
            deceased party was caused by the wound which he had received; and the skill of the <lb/>
            surgeon often forms the disputed point. Beck in his Medical Jurisprudence, chapter <lb/>
            15, affords much useful information upon the subject. </note><note type="footnote"> " It may happen," says he, "that while the patient is suffering under a wound, he <lb/>
            is attacked with disease and dies: and the question then arises, whether the fatality <lb/>
            is owing to the wound or the disease. In some instances the solution is easy ; in <lb/>
            others it is attended with considerable difficulty. Thus, for example, a fever attended <lb/>
            with comatose symptoms may supervene on a wound of the head, and pleurisy may <lb/>
            follow on a wound in the thorax. The probability in such instances is, that the injury <lb/>
            has produced the disease; but there is, notwithstanding, sufficient latitude left for <lb/>
            doubt, and circumstances may arise which will prevent us from assigning the wound <lb/>
            as the cause of death. On the other hand, should gangrene, buboes, petechiæ, or the <lb/>
            other symptoms of malignant fevers appear on a wounded person in a hospital, or <lb/>
            during the warm season of the year, or during the prevalence of such an epidemic, it <lb/>
            would certainly seem the cause of death is distinct from the danger of the wound. <lb/>
            A similar observation will apply, when an inflammatory or typhus fever supervenes on <lb/>
            slight wounds, and renders them fatal. * * * * </note><note type="footnote"> " In cases brought before courts of justice, however, it is to be recollected, that they <lb/>
            are far from being as easy of solution as those just quoted. They are generally of <lb/>
            intemperate persons who have engaged in brawls, receive injuries, and after an un­ <lb/>
            certain period die ; and the question arises, whether the habits of drunkenness or the <lb/>
            blow has caused the loss of life. As a general rule, I would always lean towards the <lb/>
            accused, unless the proof of malice is conclusive. The habitual use of spirituous <lb/>
            liquors is so apt to produce a diseased state of the system, that, with the above ex­ <lb/>
            ception, we shall best promote the ends of justice by considering the offence as a <lb/>
            secondary one." </note><note type="footnote"> All this he illustrates by numerous examples. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) <foreign xml:lang="grc">Βουλεύσεως</foreign>. Perhaps the prosecutor might waive the more serious charge, and <lb/>

            They put into a port of Lesbos, and there changed ships. Herodes <lb/>
            went on shore, and was not seen again. The defendant, on his return <lb/>
            to Athens, was accused by the relations of Herodes of having made <lb/>
            away with him. The only direct evidence against him is that of a <lb/>
            slave, who had been put to the torture. The prisoner declares that <lb/>
            what the slave said upon the rack he denied both before and after. He <lb/>
            pleads also, that the proceedings taken against him were illegal. Being <lb/>
            charged with murder, he ought to have been tried according to the <lb/>
            laws of homicide-the prosecutors would have an unfair advantage, <lb/>
            by escaping from the solemn oath and other formalities prescribed by <lb/>
            the laws of the Areopagus—the jury therefore were bound to acquit <lb/>
            him on the present arraignment, and that would not prevent his <lb/>
            being afterwards tried for murder.</p>
          <p>The speech of Lysias against Agoratus was written in support of <lb/>
            a prosecution similar in point of form to that last mentioned. <lb/>
            Agoratus had caused the death of many innocent citizens, by <lb/>
            acting as an informer and agent for the Thirty Tyrants. He was <lb/>
            proceeded against by information, and tried before a popular jury.</p>
          <p>The defence of the party charged with killing Eratosthenes is in­ <lb/>
            structive as to the domestic habits of the Athenians. The ground of <lb/>
            justification is, that he caught the deceased in adultery with his wife. <lb/>
            On the other side it appears to have been alleged, that Eratosthenes <lb/>
            was entrapped into the defendant's house, and therefore he was not <lb/>
            entitled to an acquittal. The- case was perhaps tried in the court of <lb/>
            Delphinium.</p>
          <p>There are two defences of Lysias to charges of malicious wounding, <lb/>
            tried before the Areopagus. One is the speech against Simon; in <lb/>
            which the defendant asserts, that the wound was inflicted without <lb/>
            any malicious intent in a brawl caused by the prosecutor himself. <lb/>
            The other speech is anonymous.</p>
          <p>We must now proceed to offences of a different description, and <lb/>
            first to those which are committed directly against the executive <lb/>
            government, such as</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">TREASON AND HIGH STATE CRIMES.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Treason, the crimen læsæ majestatis of the Romans, has in. all <lb/>
            countries been regarded as the gravest offence which any man, as <lb/>
            member of the political community, can be guilty of. We may define <lb/>
            it to be a betrayal of that allegiance which a man owes to the state. <lb/>
            One of its most mischievous forms is, an attempting to subvert the <lb/>
            government, in whatever way that attempt is made; as for example, <lb/>
            in monarchies, by killing or endeavouring to kill the sovereign, or to <lb/>
            usurp his power; in republics, by taking measures to establish a <lb/>
            monarchy; and under any government, by using forcible means to <lb/>
            change the laws or constitution. It is treasonable to coerce the <lb/>
            ruling power by violence; or to conspire with the enemies of the <lb/>
            country, or assist them against her. Such is the general notion of <lb/>
             <pb n="337"/>
            treason, which is applicable to almost all countries, independently of <lb/>
            any particular statute law. The most important question however <lb/>
            has been, to determine what amount of evidence should be sufficient <lb/>
            to convict men of this crime. People can rarely be tried for high <lb/>
            treason, except in cases where their attempt has failed, according to <lb/>
            the well-known maxim, <lb/>
            Treason never prospers: what's the reason ? <lb/>
            Why, when it prospers, no man calls it treason : <lb/>
            and therefore the proof of it must often depend upon acts which <lb/>
            were incomplete and dubious in their character. In judging of <lb/>
            such acts despots have always found it convenient to allow a vague <lb/>
            and arbitrary construction; while, on the other hand, the friends of <lb/>
            constitutional liberty have struggled to limit the discretion of the <lb/>
            judges appointed to try questions of high treason, and bind them by <lb/>
            strict definitions of the offence.</p>
          <p>Montesquieu (Esprit des Loix, Lib. XII. c. 8) says, it is enough <lb/>
            that the crime of treason should be vague, to make the government <lb/>
            degenerate into despotism; and he cites many examples from history <lb/>
            to illustrate this. Blackstone expresses himself to the same effect. <lb/>
            By the common law of England the crime of high treason was in <lb/>
            no way defined, so that, a large latitude of construction being left to <lb/>
            the judges, many offences of a trivial nature were adjudged to be <lb/>
            treasonable. Thus in the reign of Edward I. appealing to the <lb/>
            French courts in opposition to the king's was declared in Parliament <lb/>
            to be high treason. To prevent such loose constructions, the statute <lb/>
            of Edward III. was passed, which declares for the future what <lb/>
            should be considered treason; and nothing can be construed to be <lb/>
            treason under this statute which is not literally mentioned therein. <lb/>
            Eight different offences are specified, of which the principal are, com­ <lb/>
            passing or imagining the death of the king or queen or heir apparent, <lb/>
            levying war against the king in his realm, and adhering or giving aid <lb/>
            to the king's enemies. This statute, with some modifications, is law <lb/>
            at the present day, many tyrannical acts passed in evil times and <lb/>
            introducing new treasons having been repealed. It might seem, that <lb/>
            the first of the above-mentioned kinds of treason, viz. the compassing or <lb/>
            imagining the death of the king, consisting, as it does, in a mere in­ <lb/>
            tention or act of the mind, had too much of vagueness about it for <lb/>
            the security of the subject. In the proper construction of the statute <lb/>
            however, this treason was held not to fall under judicial cognizance, <lb/>
            unless it was evidenced by some overt act on the part of the culprit. <lb/>
            The taking of any measures to render the treasonable purpose effectual <lb/>
            was always considered a sufficient overt act of treason; for example, <lb/>
            the collecting of arms, the assembling of forces, the holding con-, <lb/>
            sultations or carrying on correspondence in furtherance of the design. <lb/>
            Some of these overt acts, which used to be regarded as evidences of <lb/>
            treason, were made substantive treasons in the reign of George III., <lb/>
            and the law has been much simplified and improved. Divers secu- <note type="footnote"> VOL. III. </note> <note type="footnote"> z </note> <lb/>

            rities, rendered necessary by the violence of unconstitutional kings <lb/>
            and the servility of ministers and judges, have been provided by the <lb/>
            wisdom of the English legislature; which there is not room to refer <lb/>
            to here. (See Coke's Institute, HE. 7; Hawkins' Pleas of the <lb/>
            Crown, I. 34; Blackstone’s Commentaries, IV. chap. 6; Hallam’s <lb/>
            Constitutional History, HE. p. 204, &amp;c.)</p>
          <p>No such safeguards were provided by the Athenian lawgiver for <lb/>
            the members -of his commonwealth. The circumstances indeed were <lb/>
            very different. The people were the rulers. They themselves-or a <lb/>
            large body taken from among them, which was the same thing—were <lb/>
            the judges who tried persons charged with violating the majesty of <lb/>
            their power. Every man who tried such a charge was interested that <lb/>
            the law should not be strained too far against the accused: for it <lb/>
            might in like manner be strained against himself at some future time. <lb/>
            Looking at the matter in this point of view, there would seem to <lb/>
            have been less necessity for providing checks to a judicialpower, <lb/>
            which was exercised by and for the benefit of the people. We may <lb/>
            go further, and saY-It was impossible to provide any such check <lb/>
            after the democracy had been fully established. But was there no <lb/>
            danger to be apprehended from the violence of a popular tribunal, <lb/>
            attached to their own free constitution, and alarmed at any appearance <lb/>
            of a revolutionary design ? As a despot fears any tumultuous rising <lb/>
            of the people, lest it should terminate in rebellion, so must a demo­ <lb/>
            cracy, until it has been tranquillized by the long and undisturbed <lb/>
            continuance of power, dread the ambitious projects of men who are <lb/>
            distinguished by superior birth, wealth, and talents. That the <lb/>
            Athemans were not exempt from fears of this sort, is proved by the <lb/>
            histories of Themistocles, Cimon, Alcibiades, and other eminent <lb/>
            citizens. Perhaps at no time during the existence of the democracy <lb/>
            can they have regarded it as wholly safe and secure. The remem­ <lb/>
            brance of Cylon's conspiracy, of the Pisistratids, of Isagoras, of <lb/>
            Pisander and Phrynichus, and of the tyranny of the Thirty—not to <lb/>
            mention the revolutions which were continually occurring in other <lb/>
            states of Greece-must have kept alive in them a sense of political <lb/>
            danger. And yet with all this it does not appear that the Athenian <lb/>
            juries, as a general rule, dealt harshly or unjustly with men tried for <lb/>
            political offences. The humanity and love of justice which belonged <lb/>
            to the Athenian character prevented any such consequence: though <lb/>
            the laws themselves against treasonable conspiracy were decidedly <lb/>
            severe, and in construing the offence a most ample discretion was <lb/>
            left to the judicial body.</p>
          <p>The hatred of the Athenians against tyrants and tyranny abun­ <lb/>
            dantly appears by the honours which they paid to tyrannicides, those, <lb/>
            of other countries as well as their own. (See ante, pp. 204, 212.) They <lb/>
            went indeed beyond this: they not only honoured the tyrannicide <lb/>
            after the event, but encouraged and stimulated him to the enterprise <lb/>
            beforehand. A special decree was passed after the deposition of the <lb/>
             <pb n="339"/>
            oligarchy of Four Hundred, making it lawful to kill any man who <lb/>
            attempted to establish a despotism or subvert the democracy, or <lb/>
            those who aided and abetted him; and prescribing an oath to be <lb/>
            taken by every Athenian, that he would kill with his own hand any <lb/>
            person who made the attempt. This was the decree of Demo­ <lb/>
            phantus, referred to in the Oration against Leptines. (Ante, p. 54.) <lb/>
            Among the aiders and abettors, whom it was lawful to kill, were <lb/>
            included those who should dare to hold office under the usurping <lb/>
            government. We may regard this decree as a solemn declaration by <lb/>
            the whole people, that they would uphold their constitution as by <lb/>
            jaw established. To kill a man, if it was necessary to prevent the <lb/>
            accomplishment of treason, would be lawful and justifiable in any <lb/>
            country: the danger of encouraging such a thing by express statute <lb/>
            would be, that the privilege might be abused. We have seen that <lb/>
            in cases where the public safety required it the Council of Areopagus <lb/>
            were authorised to deal summarily with offenders; and that they <lb/>
            exercised this power with great severity on some occasions. (See <lb/>
            Vol. II. Appendix III.)</p>
          <p>The ordinary law however was not deficient in providing for the <lb/>
            punishment of these offences at Athens. There were indictments <lb/>
            and impeachments for treason, and specially for the attempt to <lb/>
            establish a tyranny, or to put down the democracy.1 We have two <lb/>
            speeches of Lysias, and a fragment of a third, upon charges of the <lb/>
            last description: The first is a defence of one Polystratus, who had <lb/>
            acted as a member of the Council during the oligarchy of the Four <lb/>
            Hundred; the second, an anonymous defence of a man, accused of <lb/>
            having been a partisan of the Thirty Tyrants. Under the general <lb/>
            title of <foreign xml:lang="grc">προδοσία</foreign>, or treason, were included not only such offences <lb/>
            as we should designate by that name, but many that we should term <lb/>
            high misprisions or misdemeanors. The orators indeed frequently use <lb/>
            the term loosely, and not according to its strict legal acceptation. <lb/>
            In a large sense, every man may be said to be a traitor, or guilty of <lb/>
            treason against his country, who corruptly sacrifices her interests, or <lb/>
            neglects the duty which he owes to her; and we find offences branded <lb/>
            with this name by the orators, to which the laws gave other and <lb/>
            more appropriate titles.2 The Athenian juries however had full <lb/>
            power of interpretation upon an actual trial for treason. This is <lb/>
            strongly exemplified by the case of Leocrates, who was tried for <lb/>
            having deserted his country after the battle of Chæronea. (See <lb/>
            Vol. II. p. 393.) Conviction for treason was usually followed by <lb/>
            capital sentence. The body of the condemned was cast out of the <lb/>
            country without burial, his house was razed to the ground, and the <lb/>
            infamy descended to his children. After the death of Themistocles, <lb/>
            who was banished for treason, his relations (according to their own <note type="footnote"> (1) <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τυραννίδος</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">καταλύσεως του̃ δήμου</foreign>. See Meier and Schömann, Att. Proc. <lb/>

            account) brought his bones to Athens, and buried them secretly; <lb/>
            but this was contrary to law, as Thucydides tells us. (I. 138.) It is <lb/>
            noticed by Meier as a peculiarity in the Athenian law, that traitors <lb/>
            might be proceeded against after their death. This was done at least <lb/>
            in the case of Phrynichus, one of the chiefs in the oligarchy of Four <lb/>
            Hundred; who having been assassinated in the year B.C. 411, shortly <lb/>
            before the deposition of the Four Hundred, the people afterwards <lb/>
            went through the ceremony of trying him for the part which he had <lb/>
            taken in the revolution against the democracy, and for treasonable <lb/>
            correspondence with the Lacedæmonians. Condemnation was formally <lb/>
            passed upon him; his bones were dug up, and cast out of Attica; <lb/>
            and the Athenian franchise was conferred as a reward upon the <lb/>
            persons who claimed to have been his murderers.1 About the same <lb/>
            time his colleagues Antiphon and Archeptolemus, having been tried <lb/>
            and condemned for the same acts of treason, suffered the extreme <lb/>
            penalties of the law.</p>
          <p>Indictments were allowed at Athens upon a general charge of <lb/>
            wronging the State, or deceiving either the people or the council or <lb/>
            the courts of justice.2 (See ante, p. 46. Vol. II. pp. 102, 204.) Thus, <lb/>
            Miltiades appears to have been convicted upon a charge of deceiving <lb/>
            the people. (Herodotus, VI. 136.) Ambassadors were liable to a <lb/>
            charge of misconduct in the embassy; which charge, as we have seen <lb/>
            clearly enough from the speech of Demosthenes against Æschines, <lb/>
            might include the crime of high treason as well as lesser misde­ <lb/>
            meanors, and in short, every kind of culpable negligence in the per­ <lb/>
            formance of their duty. Indictments for illegality, <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρανόμων</foreign>, the <lb/>
            subject of which has been discussed in the Second Volume, were <lb/>
            preferable against the authors of statutes or decrees, which were <lb/>

          <p>Embezzlement of the public money was triable under a special <lb/>
            indictment.3 All magistrates and officers, through whose hands any <lb/>

            Logistæ, or Auditors, within thirty days after the expiration of their <lb/>
            official term, or they were liable to be indicted for the default. <lb/>
            Strict laws were made to ensure the responsibility of such persons <lb/>

            or any part of it to the Gods, or to be adopted into other families, or <lb/>
            to make their wills; in short, to use the language of Æschines,1 the <lb/>
            law held their property in pledge until they had passed their <lb/>
            accounts. At the tune of the audit any citizen might appear to <lb/>
            accuse them: and, as the responsibility of the higher functionaries <lb/>
            was not confined to financial and pecuniary questions, charges of <lb/>
            embezzlement and pecuniary deficit might be combined with other <lb/>
            official malversations. (See Vol. II. p. 27, note 1.)</p>
          <p>The severe measures adopted to enforce the payment of debts to <lb/>
            the State have been partly noticed already. (Ante, p. 52, note 3.) <lb/>
            An information lay against any one whose name was not duly <lb/>
            entered as a debtor in the public register, or who presumed to <lb/>
            exercise civic privileges before he had discharged the debt.2 If his <lb/>
            name were improperly erased from the register, an indictment lay <lb/>
            against him, and doubtless against all who were parties to the <lb/>
            erasure, and against the officers by whose neglect it was caused;3 <lb/>
            while, on the other hand, those who made wrongful entries of debts <lb/>
            in the register were liable to be prosecuted by the parties aggrieved.4 <lb/>
            The trial of such prosecutions took place before the Thesmothetæ.</p>
          <p>As a better means of recovering the public debts and preventing <lb/>
            frauds upon the treasury, any citizen was at liberty to give <lb/>
            information of goods or effects which either belonged to the state, <lb/>
            or had been confiscated, or were liable to be seized in execution. <lb/>
            It was the ordinary business of the Demarchi to inquire after such <lb/>
            property; and sometimes extraordinary officers called Zetetæ were <lb/>
            appointed to make the necessary search. It might happen that <lb/>
            public property had got into the hands of a private individual; or <lb/>
            that a state-debtor had concealed his effects, or procured a friend to <lb/>
            conceal them for him; or that his goods were taken and held by some <lb/>
            one under a wrongful claim. The party discovering this handed in <lb/>
            a written statement to the magistrate, containing a description or <lb/>
            schedule of the property in question, and showing where and in <lb/>
            whose possession it was to be found. If the holder of the property <lb/>
            allowed the claim of the state, the public officers took possession, <lb/>
            and there was an end of the matter. If he disputed it, whether <lb/>
            wholly or in part, which might be either on the ground that the <lb/>
            property was his own, or that he had a mortgage or lien upon it, <lb/>
            recourse was had to a trial by jury; in which, if the property had <lb/>
            not been seized on behalf of the state, the informer appeared as <lb/>
            prosecutor, but, if it had been seized, he appeared as defendant, and <note type="footnote"> (1) Cent. Ctesiph. 56. HVEXVPIFCI TUP ovaiav o vofMoOerris rut Trot, vtrevQvviav, eciv av </note> <figure type="illustration">

          <p>We have three speeches of Lysias and one of Demosthenes upon <lb/>
            trials of this kind. The speech of Lysias against Philocrates was <lb/>
            written in support of an information, which charged him with having <lb/>
            in his possession the confiscated property of Ergocles, a condemned <lb/>
            criminal. The speech entitled On the property of Aristophanes is <lb/>
            a defence composed for the father-in-law of Aristophanes upon the <lb/>
            like charge. In each of these cases the question is the same; namely, <lb/>
            whether certain property in the possession of the accused really <lb/>
            formed a part of that which was confiscated to the state. The <lb/>
            speech of Demosthenes against Nicostratus was written in defence <lb/>
            of his client Apollodorus, who is charged with having wrongfully <lb/>
            scheduled three slaves of the prosecutor as the property of one <lb/>
            Arethusius. Here the question is simply, whether those three slaves <lb/>
            belonged to Nicostratus, or whether they belonged to Arethusius, <lb/>
            and thus were liable to be seized by the State under a judgment <lb/>
            against him.</p>
          <p>In some cases, as it appears, the defendant brought up on one of <lb/>
            these revenue processes was permitted to impugn the original judg­ <lb/>
            ment, by which his property became liable to seizure. We have an <lb/>
            example in the speech of Lysias for the Soldier. One Polyænus was <lb/>
            fined by the Generals for speaking abusive language of them. The fine <lb/>
            not having been paid, his property is scheduled, and he is called upon <lb/>
            to show cause why it should not be taken to satisfy the fine. He <lb/>
            alleges in answer, that the fine was unlawfully imposed, and that <lb/>
            such was the opinion even of the treasurers, to whom it was returned, <lb/>
            and who had declined to enforce it. In effect, his defence is an <lb/>
            appeal to a jury from the sentence of the Generals. Whether, when <lb/>
            a penalty had been inflicted by a jury, the legality or justice of it <lb/>
            could strictly be contested upon a proceeding of this kind, may <lb/>
            reasonably be doubted.2</p>

          <p>Debasing of the coin,3 either by lessening its weight or by alloying <lb/>

            We do not learn that the simple act of coining by an individual was <lb/>

              such right by the subject was deemed criminal, whether he dete­ <lb/>
              riorated the coin or not. By the statute of Edward I. it was declared <lb/>
              to be high treason to counterfeit the king’s money, or to import any <lb/>
              such counterfeit money for purposes of merchandise. And now by <lb/>
              various statutes it is felony and highly penal, to counterfeit any coin <lb/>
              of the realm, or to make or procure tools or stamps for the purpose, <lb/>
              or to alter, lighten, or impair any of the current coin, or to counter­ <lb/>
              feit any of the gold or silver corn of foreign states, or knowingly to <lb/>
              utter any base or counterfeit money, whether to pass it as foreign or <lb/>
              English. It does not appear that the Athenian government, though <lb/>
              it possessed its own mint (argyrocopeum), reserved to itself the <lb/>
              exclusive right to coin money. On the contrary, it appears from <lb/>
              inscriptions on some ancient coins which are extant, that they were <lb/>
              struck by the townships of Attica; and we know that the money of <lb/>
              other countries, as the stater of Cyzicus and the daric, passed com­ <lb/>
              monly at Athens. The Athenians however were most anxious to <lb/>
              maintain the purity of their gold and silver coinage, and therefore <lb/>
              made the debasing of it a capital offence. In one instance only <lb/>
              during the period of the democracy were they known to use base <lb/>
              metal in the coinage, and that was at a time of great distress, just <lb/>
              before the close of the Peloponnesian war. (See Böckh’s Public <lb/>

              Attic orators knows how lightly they made charges of this kind <lb/>
              against their opponents, how Demosthenes denounces the corruption <lb/>
              of the philippising party, and how AEschines returns the compliment. <lb/>
              Four orations are extant upon direct prosecutions for bribery: one <lb/>
              by Lysias; which, being a second speech, gives us very little infor­ <lb/>
              mation upon the subject;1 and the three of Dinarchus, against <lb/>
              Demosthenes, Aristogiton, and Philocles, written in support of the <lb/>
              prosecution for taking bribes of Harpalus. Demosthenes, having <lb/>
              first been pronounced guilty upon this charge by a report of the <lb/>
              Areopagus, was brought to trial before a jury, who convicted, and <lb/>
              sentenced him to pay a fine of fifty talents. Being unable to pay the <lb/>
              fine, he was thrown into prison, but soon afterwards escaped and <lb/>
              went into exile. The justice of the verdict is exceedingly doubtful. <lb/>
              (See Thirlwall’s History of Greece, VII. 156, &amp;c.)</p>
          <p>In our own country it has always been a misdemeanor by the <lb/>
            common law, for any of the judges or officers of the king's courts <lb/>
            to take a bribe; and a statute passed in the reign of Henry IV. <lb/>
            ordered persons so offending to forfeit treble the value of what <lb/>
            they had received. Notwithstanding the law, we know that the prac­ <lb/>
            tice of receiving presents continued (even after the impeachment of <lb/>
            Bacon) until the sentence upon Lord Macclesfield in 1724. The <lb/>
            number of statutes passed to prevent bribery at elections, and the <lb/>
            ill success which has attended thein—the notorious corruption of <lb/>
            public men in many periods of our history-the infamous mode in <lb/>
            which public patronage has been dispensed-all this may convince <lb/>
            us, that Xenophon's assertion, " that anything could be done at <lb/>
            Athens for a bribe," was not more applicable to Athenians than to <lb/>
            Englishmen.</p>

            <title type="sub">PERJURY AND PETTIFOGGERY.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Perjury, or at least false testimony, was by the Athenian law deemed <lb/>
            a civil offence, and subjected the false witness to an action at the suit <lb/>
            of the party injured. The jury however, besides giving damages to <lb/>
            the plaintiff in the action, might inflict on the defendant, if they <lb/>
            pleased, the penalty of disfranchisement; and upon a third conviction <lb/>
            a man was ipso jure disfranchised. Subornation of perjury drew with <lb/>
            it similar consequences.2 On the other hand, a witness who falsely <lb/>
            swore to the service of a summons was liable to a criminal prosecu­ <lb/>
            tion, and might in a gross case be punished even with death.3</p>
          <p>By the name of pettifoggery I designate that class of offences <note type="footnote"> (1) Meier (Att. Proc. 351) suggests that the speech, which has been entitled <lb/>

              of legal process for mischievous or fraudulent purposes. Such prac­ <lb/>
              tices, owing to the policy of the law which encouraged private <lb/>
              individuals to come forward as informers and prosecutors, became <lb/>
              very common at Athens. The offenders might be proceeded against <lb/>
              by indictment, or information, or even impeachment in very serious <lb/>
              cases. The punishment was discretionary with the jury.1</p>

          </ab>
          <p>Any one who, not being a citizen, exercised the rights of citizenship <lb/>
            at Athens, was amenable to an indictment,2 which any Athenian <lb/>
            might prefer against him. If convicted, his person and property <lb/>
            were forfeited to the state, and he was sold forthwith for a slave. If <lb/>
            he procured his acquittal by collusion or bribery, he was liable to <lb/>
            another prosecution,3 which was attended with the same results. <lb/>
            The cognizance of this offence belonged anciently to the Nautodicæ, <lb/>
            but in the time of Demosthenes to the Thesmothetæ.4</p>
          <p>In order to preserve the purity of Attic descent, a law was passed <lb/>
            by Pericles, making it necessary to citizenship that both the father <lb/>
            and the mother should be Athenians; which law was re-enacted by <lb/>
            Aristophon B.C. 403. An indictment lay against any Athenian of <lb/>
            either sex, who married a foreigner; and against any foreigner of <lb/>
            either sex, who married an Athenian; and against any citizen, who <lb/>
            gave a foreign woman in marriage to another citizen, pretending that <lb/>
            she was his relation, or who gave a woman, whose guardian he was, <lb/>
            in marriage to a foreigner abroad.5 The Oration against Neæra <lb/>
            furnishes us with a good deal of information upon these points. It <lb/>
            seems also, that supposititious children might be prosecuted, and sold <lb/>
            for slaves upon conviction.6</p>
          <p>As a further precaution against the intrusion of foreigners into the <lb/>
            state, each Attic township used from time to time to revise the <lb/>
            register of its members, and to expunge the names of those who had <lb/>
            been fraudulently or improperly enrolled. The ejected member had <lb/>
            the right of appealing to a jury, who restored him on proof of his <lb/>
            title ; but, if he failed to prove it, the like sentence was pronounced <lb/>
            against him as upon an indictment for the usurpation of civic rights. <lb/>
            The Oration of Demosthenes against Eubulides was spoken upon an <lb/>

          <p>One who absented himself from the army, after being enlisted by <lb/>
            the Generals; or who declined to perform his duty, or deserted the <lb/>
            post assigned to him; or who misbehaved himself in action, either <lb/>
            by throwing away his shield or by any other act of cowardice or <lb/>
            breach of discipline; or one who committed any of the like offences in <lb/>
            the naval service; was liable to be prosecuted as a criminal,1 and, if <lb/>
            convicted, suffered the penalty of disfranchisement. A sort of court <lb/>
            martial was held for the trial of such offences, composed of the Generals, <lb/>
            (assisted perhaps by the inferior Officers,) as presidents, and a jury <lb/>
            of the soldiers or sailors who were comrades of the accused.2 The <lb/>
            great importance of the naval service made it necessary to enact <lb/>
            severe laws against the trierarchs who failed to keep their ships in <lb/>
            repair, to provide proper equipments, &amp;c. The appointment of a <lb/>
            deputy captain was in strictness considered to be a desertion of duty, <lb/>
            though the practice was permitted in later times. There are two <lb/>
            speeches of Lysias against Alcibiades upon a prosecution for breach <lb/>
            of military duty. The defendant, a son of the famous Alcibiades, <lb/>
            had joined the ranks of the horsemen, instead of serving, as he should <lb/>
            have done, among the heavy-armed infantry: this was by law a <lb/>
            desertion of his post. The act of Midias in taking the command of <lb/>
            his ship, in order to escape from service in the cavalry, is characterised <lb/>
            by Demosthenes as an offence of the like nature. (See ante, pp. 119— <lb/>
            121.) Demosthenes himself had an indictment preferred against him <lb/>
            for desertion of post, as we have seen, (ante, p. 99.)</p>

          <p>The most important under this head is Impiety; a term of very <lb/>
            extended signification; embracing not only charges of a specific <lb/>
            nature, such as desecration of temples, images, altars, or graves; <lb/>
            violation of the right of asylum; profanation or disclosure of the <lb/>

            do;3 digging up of the sacred olives; breaches of the ceremonial <lb/>

              Earl Marshal of England. This court fell altogether into disuse after the execution <lb/>
              of the Duke of Buckingham (who was the last High Constable) in the reign of <lb/>
              Henry VIII., its authority having long before been encroached upon by the arbitrary <lb/>
              commissions of the crown; but all the military jurisdiction of the common law has <lb/>
              been superseded by the courts martial established after the Revolution. See Hallam's <lb/>

              established religion, blasphemy against the Gods, neglect of public <lb/>
              worship, teaching of mischievous doctrines or fake philosophy, and <lb/>
              the like. Of the last description one of the most remarkable instances <lb/>
              is that of Anaxagoras, who was thrown into prison on account of his <lb/>
              theories respecting the Sun. It required all the influence of Pericles <lb/>
              to obtain his release. Protagoras was banished from Athens for <lb/>
              having expressed himself doubtfully about the existence of the Gods. <lb/>
              Diagoras of Melos got the name of an atheist seemingly, because <lb/>
              he held less gross opinions as to the nature of the Deity than his <lb/>
              contemporaries. After the punishment of his countrymen by the <lb/>
              Athenians in the Peloponnesian war, a religions cry was raised against <lb/>
              him at Athens; he was obliged to fly, and a reward of a talent was <lb/>
              offered to any person who should kill him. (See Diodorus, XIII. 6. <lb/>
              Cicero, De Natura Deorum, I. 23. Plutarch, Vit. Pericl. 32. Vit. <lb/>
              Nic. 23.) Socrates is invidiously called the Melian by Aristophanes, <lb/>
              meaning that he was an atheist like Diagoras. (Nubes, 830.) The <lb/>
              prosecution of Socrates, his condemnation and death, are familiar to <lb/>
              alL (See ante, p. 258.) Such charges might be preferred by any <lb/>
              Athenian citizen; and they afforded a wide scope for persecution by <lb/>
              political enemies or informers.1 But what is the religious persecution <lb/>
              of ancient times compared with that of modem? Let us only look <lb/>
              back to the records of our own history, and to those laws by which <lb/>
              apostacy, heresy, popery, non-conformity, sorcery, witchcraft, &amp;c., <lb/>
              were reckoned among the most heinous crimes; all of which now <lb/>
              (and we ought indeed to be thankful for it) are either expunged from <lb/>
              the statute book, or left solely to ecclesiastical cognizance; simony <lb/>
              and blasphemous libel being almost the only pure offences against <lb/>
              religion, which are punishable by our criminal law.</p>
          <p>We have four extant speeches upon trials for impiety. The most <lb/>
            interesting of these is the Apologia Socratis of Plato, an imaginary <lb/>
            oration, supposed to have been spoken by Socrates in his own <lb/>
            defence. There is also the speech written by Lvsias for the prosecu­ <lb/>
            tion against Andocides; that of Andocides in his own defence, an <lb/>
            able composition, which throws much light upon the history of the <lb/>
            day; and that of Lysias upon the Sacred Olive, in which he defends <lb/>
            a man charged with having dug up one of those trees which Athenian <lb/>
            piety held to be sacred.2 <note type="footnote"> (1) A charge of atheism it thus made against Andocides in the Oration of Lysias, </note> <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BOHN_19_fig94.jpg"/></figure><note type="footnote"> (2) These were believed to have been propagated from the original olive planted <lb/>

              down any of these was death. There was also a law (cited by Demosthenes cent. <lb/>
              Macartatum, 1074) for the protection of common olive-trees, the culture of which <lb/>
              was deemed important. It prohibited the owner from cutting down any, except <lb/>
              for a public festival, or two a year for his own private use, or for a funeral; and for <lb/>
              every one that should be destroyed unlawfully gave a penalty of a hundred drachms <lb/>
              to the state, and as much to the prosecutor. (See Böckh’s Public Economy it <lb/>

              </p>
          <p>The last-mentioned oration is addressed to the court of Areopagus: <lb/>
            from which, as well as from some other examples mentioned by ancient <lb/>
            writers, we collect that the Areopagus took occasional cognizance of <lb/>
            the crime of impiety. The King-Archon doubtless had the right to <lb/>
            bring such offences before a popular jury, as was done in the instances <lb/>
            of Socrates and Andocides: but the Areopagites, having a censorial <lb/>
            power as guardians of the public morals, might assume to themselves <lb/>
            in a certain class of cases a concurrent jurisdiction; while others might <lb/>
            be specially referred to them by the magistrate or by popular decree. <lb/>
            The jurisdiction of the Eumolpids, to which Demosthenes refers in <lb/>
            the Oration against Androtion, (ante, p. 148,) in whatever way it was <lb/>
            exercised, (which is unknown to us,) was doubtless of very limited <lb/>
            application, and probably confined to ceremonial questions of no great <lb/>
            importance.</p>
          <p>The proceedings against the accused might be either by indictment, <lb/>
            or information, or impeachment, or arraignment before the popular <lb/>
            assembly, according to the nature of the case. The penalty was <lb/>
            (generally speaking) discretionary with the jury. It might be death, <lb/>
            fine, or banishment. Of the sentence passed upon Socrates I shall <lb/>
            speak by and by.</p>
          <p>Adultery, which by the common law of England is only a civil <lb/>
            offence, 1 though amenable to censure under the ecclesiastical law, <lb/>
            was at Athens considered as highly criminal. We have seen, by the <lb/>
            statute cited in the Oration against Aristocrates, (ante, p. 184,) that it <lb/>
            was lawful for a man to kill on the spot one whom he caught in <lb/>
            adultery with his wife, daughter, sister, or even concubine with whom <lb/>
            he lived on certain terms. He was at liberty however to forego his <lb/>
            lawful revenge, and to accept money in satisfaction; in which case he <lb/>
            might detain the person of the adulterer, until he found sureties for <lb/>
            payment. In all cases, whether the adulterer were caught in the act <lb/>
            or not, the husband or aggrieved party might indict him. What <lb/>
            punishment he was liable to upon conviction, is not known to us: <lb/>
            probably it was at least disfranchisement. The husband of an <lb/>
            adulteress was obliged to dismiss her, under pain of being himself <lb/>
            disfranchised. She was forbidden afterwards to enter the temples, <lb/>
            or even to go into public with any of the ornaments which free <lb/>
            women were accustomed to wear. If she did so, any one who met her <lb/>
            might tear them off, and treat her with every kind of indignity, short <lb/>
            of maiming and wounding. This, as AEschines tells us, was by an <lb/>
            ancient law of Solon. (Orat. Cont. Timarchum, 26. Compare <lb/>
            Demosthenes cont. Neæram, 1374.)</p>
          <p>From the Oration against Neæra, as well as from that of Lysias <lb/>
            against Eratosthenes and other sources, we may collect, that the <lb/>
            right of the husband or guardian to inflict summary punishment on <note type="footnote"> (1) A statute was passed under the Commonwealth, in 1650, which made adultery a <lb/>
            capital crime; but this was repealed in the reign of Charles II. By the law of Moses <lb/>
            it was capital. See Leviticus, ch. xx. ver. 10. Deuteronomy, ch. xxii. ver. 22. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="349"/>
            the adulterer was liable to abuse. There were laws however to <lb/>
            prevent money being extorted under pretence of such a charge. It <lb/>
            was necessary for the party so avenging himself, to give proof that <lb/>
            the adulteress was his wife, daughter, sister, &amp;c. The paramour, <lb/>
            whose person he had detained, might indict him for false imprison­ <lb/>
            ment, if the detention were contrary to law; and, if he succeeded, <lb/>
            he and his sureties were released from their liability; otherwise, he <lb/>
            was given up to his adversary, who might inflict upon him a limited <lb/>
            amount of corporal chastisement. Such cases were triable before <lb/>
            the Thesmothetæ.1</p>
          <p>It was certainly not the fault of the laws at Athens, if the. <lb/>
            purity of public morals was not preserved. There were severe <lb/>
            statutes against procurers and procuresses, who seduced free-born <lb/>
            youths and maidens from the path of virtue; and also against <lb/>
            parents and guardians, who permitted them to lead vicious lives. In <lb/>
            the Oration of Dinarchus against Demosthenes (24, Ed. Bekker), <lb/>
            mention is made of one Euthymachus, who was put to death for <lb/>
            having placed an Olynthian girl in a brothel. Aspasia was indicted <lb/>
            by Hermippus the comedian, for bringing the wives and daughters <lb/>
            of citizens into the house of Pericles for an unlawful purpose. <lb/>
            (Plutarch, Vit. Pericl. 32.) As to the punishment inflicted for <lb/>
            nameless offences, and the civic disabilities to which they subjected <lb/>
            the parties who had been guilty of them, the scholar may (if he <lb/>
            pleases) consult the Oration of Æschines against Timarchus, especially <lb/>
            pages 2 and 3; also the arguments to the Orations on the Embassy <lb/>
            and against Androtion, pages 146—149, 244, of this volume, and <lb/>
            the Attic process of Meier and Schömann, p. 332.</p>

            <title type="sub">THEFT, ROBBERY, ETC.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>It has been already shown that theft might be dealt with as a civil <lb/>
            offence by the party injured, though even then it drew with it some <lb/>
            penal consequences, as a verdict against the thief was attended with <lb/>
            disfranchisement. (Ante, p. 147, note.) The distinction drawn by <lb/>
            the Athenians between thefts under fifty drachms and thefts above <lb/>
            that sum reminds us of the ancient distinction in our own country <lb/>
            between grand and petty larceny. 2 The increased severity with <lb/>
            which they punished for stealing at night, or in the public baths, <lb/>
            the gymnasia, or the harbours, was founded upon obviously good <lb/>
            reasons. The like difference is now made by us between simple and <lb/>
            compound larceny; for example, we have distinctive punishments for <lb/>
            stealing from a master, stealing in a dwelling-house, stealing from <lb/>
            the person, highway robbery, burglary, &amp;c. The Athenians had <lb/>
            names much like our own for the highway-robber,3 the housebreaker,4 <note type="footnote"> (1) The charge was called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀδίκως εἱρχθη̃ναι ὼς οιχόν</foreign>. See the Oration against <lb/>

              and the pickpocket.1 The tomb-breaker2 was one who broke open <lb/>
              the graves to rob the dead. All such persons were called by the <lb/>
              common name of malefactors.3 Sacrilege might be dealt with under <lb/>
              the laws against impiety, with especial reference to the desecration of <lb/>
              the sanctuary, or it might be treated as a species of compound robbery. <lb/>
              There is an Oration of Lysias entitled The defence of Callias for <lb/>
              sacrilege:” it is bait a fragment however, and gives us no information <lb/>
              upon the subject.</p>
          <p>The private suits and minor charges of theft were tried before the <lb/>
            Thesmothetæ. Robberies of the more heinous kind were cognizable <lb/>
            by the Eleven. It was lawful for the party robbed, either with or <lb/>
            without assistance, to seize the person of the robber and carry him <lb/>
            at once before the magistrate; or, if he was afraid to do so, he <lb/>
            might procure the assistance of the magistrate to take him into <lb/>
            custody. If the prisoner confessed the crime, the Eleven might <lb/>
            puthim to death without any delay: this remarkable difference <lb/>
            between the Athenian practice and our own I have had occasion to <lb/>
            advert to before, (Vol. II. p. 204.) If he did not confess, the <lb/>
            Eleven brought him to trial before a jury.4</p>
          <p>Kidnapping5 also belongs to this class of offences. It might be ex­ <lb/>
            pected that the Athenians, who attached such importance to the title <lb/>
            of free citizen, would severely punish any one who sold a freeman for <lb/>
            a slave. The Thessalians are said to have been addicted to this <lb/>
            practice. 6 Among the Jews it was a capital crime, as we read in <lb/>
            Exodus, ch. xxi. ver. 16.—" And he that stealeth a man and selleth <lb/>
            him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death." <lb/>
            -And the like in Deuteronomy, ch. xxiv. Ter. 7. Kidnapping was <lb/>
            called plagium by the Romans, and was the subject of penal statutes. <lb/>
            In England we have statutory punishments for stealing children <lb/>
            under ten years of age.</p>
          <p>Further, those impostors, who practised upon ignorant persons by <lb/>
            jugglery or quackery, were liable under the Athenian law to be <lb/>
            treated as malefactors, and were punishable even with death, if the <lb/>
            jury chose to inflict it.7 And with this we may compare our own <lb/>
            statutes, under which persons are liable to be imprisoned as rogues <lb/>
            and vagabonds, who “pretend to tell fortunes or use any subtle <lb/>
            device by palmistry or otherwise to impose on her Majesty's <lb/>
            subjects,”—though it is rare at this day to see a man tried for any <lb/>
            such offence.. <figure type="illustration">

          <p>For all gross assaults to the person the Athenian Jaw allowed a <lb/>
            criminal prosecution. Any blow given wantonly and intentionally to <lb/>
            a freeman was an offence of this description, the insult forming the <lb/>
            gravamen of the charge. The legal term for the offence was <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὔβρις</foreign>, <lb/>
            which denoted any personal outrage, including rape and indecent <lb/>
            assaults. (See ante, p. 73, where all this is fully explained.) <lb/>
            Demosthenes might have indicted Midias for the assault upon his <lb/>
            person at the theatre; but he chose to view it in a more serious light, <lb/>
            and to bring it before the people, as a contempt of the festival.</p>
          <p>The party who had received blows might waive the criminal <lb/>
            charge, if he pleased, and bring an action to recover damages, (ante, <lb/>
            p. 77, note 1.)</p>
          <p>The law cited by Demosthenes and praised by him for its <lb/>
            humanity, (ante, p. 81,) which made it mdictable to commit a <lb/>
            personal outrage upon a slave, is probably to be understood of <lb/>
            indecent assaults only; though it did not suit the orators argument <lb/>
            as to notice the distinction. The language of Aristotle in his Rhetoric,1 <lb/>
            well as another passage of Demosthenes himself (Cont. Nicostratum, <lb/>
            1251), favours this view of the matter. And looking at the condition <lb/>
            of slaves and the estimation in which they were regarded, in Athens <lb/>
            as well as other parts of Greece, we can hardly suppose that it would <lb/>
            be made a crime in a citizen to strike them: though undoubtedly <lb/>
            for any injury done to a slave by blows or otherwise his master <lb/>
            had a right of action. (See Meier and Schömann, Att. Proc. 325.)</p>

          <p>Certain wrongs done to parents by their children, to wives by their <lb/>
            husbands, to orphans by their guardians and relations, were punish­ <lb/>
            able at Athens by the criminal law.2</p>
          <p>To strike a parent was a heinous offence; likewise, to use abusive <lb/>
            language to him; to refuse to maintain him in indigence, and to neglect <lb/>
            the duty of burial. Misfeasances of this kind were punishable <lb/>
            either with death or otherwise at the discretion of the jury, and were <lb/>
            always attended with disfranchisement.3 <note type="footnote"> (1) Aristot. Rhet. ii. 24, 9. <foreign xml:lang="grc">η̏ εἵ τις φαίη</foreign>,TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">τύπτειν τοὺς ὲλευθέρους ὕβριν εί̄ναι οὐ</foreign> </note> <figure type="illustration">

          <p>The patria potestas of the Romans, who had the power of life <lb/>
            and death over their children, was much more severe than that of the <lb/>
            Athenians. Among the Jews it was a capital crime to curse a father <lb/>
            or mother: (Exodus, ch. xxi. ver. 17:) and for disobedience to his <lb/>
            parents a son might be stoned to death, upon accusation before the <lb/>
            elders of the city. (Deuteronomy, ch. xxi. ver. 18, &amp;c.) The <lb/>
            compulsory maintenance reminds one of our own statute, (43rd <lb/>
            Elizabeth,) requiring children with sufficient means to relieve their <lb/>
            parents who are old and impotent.</p>
          <p>Husbands were liable to prosecution for neglect of their marriage <lb/>
            duties: a proceeding similar to the suit in our ecclesiastical courts <lb/>
            for restitution of conjugal rights.</p>
          <p>With respect to widows and orphans, the legislation of Solon was <lb/>
            certainly in the spirit of the Divine command to the Jews:—“ Ye <lb/>
            shall not afflict any widow or fatherless child." (Exodus, ch. xxii. <lb/>
            ver. 22.) All such persons were under the special protection of the <lb/>
            Archon. Guardians were indictable for any breach of trust or duty <lb/>
            to their wards; as for neglecting their maintenance and education, or <lb/>
            not managing their property to the best advantage.1 So was the <lb/>
            next of kin who refused either to marry, or to endow with a <lb/>
            suitable portion, the poor orphan girl, whom the Attic law called <lb/>
            heiress of her fathers house. Disfranchisement or even severer pun­ <lb/>
            ishments attended the breach of these duties, besides pecuniary <lb/>
            compensation for any fraud which had been committed.2</p>
          <p>The reader has now before him a synopsis (not pretended indeed <lb/>
            to be a complete one) of the Athenian criminal code. He understands <lb/>
            also that, with the exception of trials by the Areopagus, almost all <lb/>
            criminal charges were brought before a jury drawn from the body of <lb/>
            the people, as shown in Vol. II. Appendix VII, and empannelled as <lb/>
            shown in a note in the same volume, page 81. The necessary prepara­ <lb/>
            tions for a hearing by the jury were made by the magistrate, or <lb/>
            board of magistrates, to whose jurisdiction the particular case <lb/>
            belonged; and the same person, or the same board, presided at the <lb/>
            trial. Thus the nine Archons presided in those cases of which they <figure type="illustration">

              had judicial cognisance respectively-the Generals upon trials for <lb/>
              breach of the military law—the Eleven upon trials for robbery-the <lb/>
              Auditors upon charges against public officers for not rendering their <lb/>
              account, &amp;c.—the Overseers of the Port upon trials for breach of the <lb/>
              commercial laws—while sometimes extraordinary functionaries were <lb/>
              appointed to conduct some special inquiry, as the Syndics to try <lb/>
              disputes concerning confiscated property.1 The judicial duty of all <lb/>
              these magistrates was chiefly matter of form and routine. In cases <lb/>
              of small moment they had power sometimes to impose a small fine: <lb/>
              in other cases, where the accused denied the charge preferred against <lb/>
              him, they were obliged to bring it before a jury for decision.</p>
          <p>In this Appendix there remains to consider- <lb/>
            I. The parties who might be prosecutors of criminal accusations: <lb/>
            II. The process by which they were carried on: <lb/>
            III. The sentence of the court: <lb/>
            IV. The execution.</p>
          <p>I. There was no regular public prosecutor at Athens, any more <lb/>
            than there is with us. The task of accusing was left to private <lb/>
            individuals. It might sometimes be the duty of a magistrate to <lb/>
            cause the law to be put in force; for example, it was the Archon's <lb/>
            duty to protect widows and orphans, and to take up their cause <lb/>
            against oppressors. Yet the forms of law would not permit him to <lb/>
            appear as prosecutor in court, where he had to exercise a judicial <lb/>
            authority: and wherever a magistrate came forward to accuse ex <lb/>
            officio, some prosecutor seems to have been appointed for the purpose, <lb/>
            as in the case of Antiphon and his colleagues, who were impeached <lb/>
            by the Generals.2 The policy of the Athenian law required that <lb/>
            there should be an actual prosecutor, who was a party to the cause, <lb/>
            who conducted it in court, and who was responsible generally for the <lb/>
            consequences: herein differing from the practice of our country, <lb/>
            where the Crown is the only party ostensibly opposed to the criminal, <lb/>
            while he who prefers the charge, and who is commonly the party <lb/>
            injured, either keeps out of sight entirely, or appears only as a <lb/>
            witness. There was no such thing at Athens as the state prose­ <lb/>
            cuting : it was not the Republic against Ctesiphon, but Æschines <lb/>
            against Ctesiphon, both in name and reality.</p>
          <p>Those cases stand on special grounds, in which Inquisitors were <lb/>
            appointed to discover and bring to justice the perpetrators of some <lb/>
            flagrant crime, as on the occasion when the Hermes busts were <lb/>
            mutilated: (Thucydides VI. 27, Andocides, De Myst. 3—5:) and <lb/>
            those where accusers or advocates were nominated by the people under <lb/>
            the influence of some strong excitement: as when Pencles was <lb/>
            directed to assist in the impeachment of Cimon; (Plutarch, Vit. <lb/>
            Pericl. 10;) and Stratocles with others to prosecute Demosthenes; <note type="footnote"> (1) See my article <foreign xml:lang="grc">Σύνδικοι</foreign> in the Archaeological Dictionary. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) See Schömann, De Comitiis, 171, 203, 204; Meier and Schömann, Att.

            (Dinarchus, cent. Demosth. 96.) Again, in eases of homicide, as we <lb/>
            have seen, the relatives of the deceased were called upon, and they <lb/>
            only were the proper persons, to bring the offender to trial. Or­ <lb/>
            dinarily however the office of prosecutor was left to be undertaken <lb/>
            by volunteers.</p>
          <p>In the majority of cases the party injured would naturally be the <lb/>
            accuser: he, for example, whose house had been robbed, or whose <lb/>
            person assaulted. An alien as well as a citizen was competent to <lb/>
            prefer an accusation in such case.1 But independently of this, any <lb/>
            citizen might come forward as prosecutor on behalf of the public, <lb/>
            who was of full age, and in possession of his franchise, not having <lb/>
            lost it by verdict or by infamous practices.2 Nor was it found that <lb/>
            there was any lack of accusers under the voluntary system. If <lb/>
            patriotism and public spirit did not afford sufficient motives, private <lb/>
            enmity or the hope of reward supplied their place. To avenge a <lb/>
            former wrong done to the accuser or to his family was, according to <lb/>
            Athenian ways of thinking, a legitimate ground for undertaking a <lb/>
            criminal charged (See the exordium of the Oration against Androtion, <note type="footnote"> (1) Meier thinks that there were some cases (besides that of homicide) where <lb/>
            only the injured party or his representatives could prosecute; as charges of theft <lb/>

            cast upon him by the adversary; and though the principle of the law was, to en­ <lb/>
            courage men to take up the public cause, the jury did not readily believe that an <lb/>
            accuser was influenced purely by zeal for the public service. Lycurgus, than whom <lb/>

              and that against Nicostratus.) In certain cases a portion of the <lb/>
              penalty was given by law to the prosecutor; as upon indictments for <lb/>
              the unlawful cohabitation of Athenians with foreigners, and for some <lb/>
              other offences of the like description; where, after conviction of the <lb/>
              defendant, a third of his confiscated property went to the accuser: <lb/>
              (Demosthenes, cont. Neæram, 1350, 1363:)—upon informations for <lb/>
              carrying corn to foreign countries, where the informer got half the. <lb/>
              penalty: (Demosthenes, cont. Theocrinem, 1325:)—likewise upon <lb/>
              charges for destroying olive-trees: (Demosthenes, cant. Macartatum, <lb/>
              1074:)—and upon revenue prosecutions, where the person who gave <lb/>
              information of property belonging to the state was entitled to a <lb/>
              ■ portion of it, if he succeeded: (Demosthenes, cont. Nicostratum, <lb/>
              1247.) Such a motive for prosecuting, though encouraged by law, <lb/>
              did not recommend itself to the favour of a jury. The informer, as <lb/>
              with ourselves, was always looked coldly upon.</p>
          <p>It was not an unusual thing for two or more persons to join in a <lb/>
            prosecution; and in such case they divided between them the conduct <lb/>
            of the case, and shared both the reward (if there was any) and the <lb/>
            responsibility. Thus Euctemon and Diodorus together indicted <lb/>
            Androtion. Ctesippus and Aphepsion jointly carried on the proceed­ <lb/>
            ings to repeal the law of Leptines.1</p>
          <p>As the prosecutor was presumed to be a person acting for the <lb/>
            public good, he had no court fees to pay like a plaintiff in a private <figure type="illustration">

              action, but only a nominal sum of a drachm upon the occasion of <lb/>
              preferring a charged There was an exception however in those <lb/>
              cases where a pecuniary reward followed the conviction of the <lb/>
              accused; in which the prosecutor was regarded in the light of a <lb/>
              private plaintiff, and had to pay the court fees. Thus the statute <lb/>
              above cited, which gave half the penalty to the accuser upon a <lb/>
              conviction for destroying olive-trees, directs that he pay the court <lb/>
              fees. In order to prevent frivolous and vexatious proceedings, it was <lb/>
              enacted that any man who dropped a prosecution which he had com­ <lb/>
              menced, or who upon the trial failed to get one-fifth of the votes, <lb/>
              should pay a penalty of a thousand drachms, and be disabled to bring <lb/>
              any similar charge in future. Such disability was a partial deprivation <lb/>
              of a man's civic rights, and was accordingly termed a limited <lb/>
              disfranchisement. No such risk however was run upon impeach­ <lb/>
              ments for ill-usage of parents and orphans, which were peculiarly <lb/>
              encouraged by the law. But in cases which partook of the nature <lb/>
              of private suits the prosecutor, if he failed to get a fifth of the <lb/>
              votes, was liable, as a plaintiff was, to pay a sixth part of the <lb/>
              penalty sought to be recovered.2</p>
          <p>A further check to groundless accusations was provided by the law <lb/>
            against pettifoggery already referred to.</p>
          <p>II. We are to consider the methods of proceeding against crimi­ <lb/>
            nals, which were prescribed by the Athenian law. Of these there <lb/>
            were several kinds; and a prosecutor frequently had his choice <lb/>
            between two or more of them, each of which offered its own par­ <lb/>
            ticular advantages. It was the policy of the law to give every <lb/>
            facility for attaining the ends of justice, and therefore it allowed <lb/>
            various remedies against the wrongdoer. (See the remarks of <lb/>
            Demosthenes upon the subject, ante, p. 147.)</p>
          <p>The processes most commonly resorted to were, Indictment, <lb/>
            Arrest, Information, Presentment, Impeachment, Plaint to the <lb/>
            Assembly.</p>

            corresponds with the English term, which is used in the like double <lb/>
            sense. But the process of the Athenians by no means coincides <lb/>

            the magistrate: a bill was then preferred against him,1 which he was <lb/>

            method of bringing him to trial was in the nature of a civil pro­ <lb/>
            ceeding.</p>
          <p>He was summoned by the prosecutor in the presence of witnesses,' <lb/>
            commonly of two. A day was named for his attendance, generally <lb/>
            about the fifth day from the summons. If he failed to attend, and <lb/>
            the summons was duly proved, the magistrate received the charge in <lb/>
            his absence, and judgment might in due course be pronounced against <lb/>
            him by default. If he attended, and the charge was proceeded with, <lb/>
            the magistrate inquired into the circumstances, and, if he thought <lb/>
            the charge was maintainable, adopted the necessary measures for <lb/>
            bringing it to trial. The bill of mdictment was handed in by the <lb/>
            prosecutor; or at least the heads of one, which was afterwards <lb/>
            reduced to a legal form. It contained the date of the prosecution, <lb/>
            the names of the parties and of the witnesses to the summons, a <lb/>
            statement of the charge, and the proposed penalty. We may take <lb/>
            for a specimen the indictment against Ctesiphon, set forth in the <lb/>
            Oration on the Crown: for, even if that document be not genuine, it <lb/>
            is probably drawn up in the accustomed form. A short abstract of <lb/>
            the charge was written on a board by the magistrate, and hung up in <lb/>
            some conspicuous place, to give public notice that it was pending for <lb/>
            trial. Such a notice of Euctemon's indictment against Demosthenes <lb/>
            was posted before the statues of the Heroes, near to the board-room <lb/>
            of the Generals, (ante, p. 99.)</p>
          <p>This mode of prosecution was applicable to most cases, and was <lb/>
            the most frequently adopted. We have three examples in the <lb/>
            present volume.3</p>

          <p>This, which we regard as an ancillary measure upon most criminal <lb/>
            prosecutions, to secure the person of the accused, was at Athens a <lb/>
            distinct process, which might be resorted to at the option of the <lb/>

              term of Attic procedure, was only then strictly applied, when the <lb/>
              accuser took the law into his own hands by seizing the criminal and <lb/>
              carrying him before the magistrate. Wherever this course was lawful, <lb/>
              the party intending to arrest was under no necessity to procure the <lb/>
              warrant of a magistrate; though, if he were afraid to attempt it <lb/>
              alone, the more prudent course was to apply for official aid, and the <lb/>
              magistrate, to whose jurisdiction the charge appertained, was bound <lb/>
              to render him all the assistance in his power.1</p>
          <p>The occasion upon which it was most usual and proper to <lb/>
            apprehend the criminal, was, where he was caught flagrante delicto. <lb/>
            For example, where a robber was caught in the act of robbery, or <lb/>
            with the thing stolen upon him—taken with the mainour, as our <lb/>
            old law expressed it-the party robbed carried him before the Eleven, <lb/>
            and gave him into their charge. If he confessed immediately, the <lb/>
            Eleven, as we have seen, might put him to death without further <lb/>
            trouble, just as under the old Danish law, which was in force in <lb/>
            this country, a robber so taken might be banged on the spot.2 If he <lb/>
            denied the charge, the Eleven held him in custody until the day of <lb/>
            trial, unless they chose to accept bail for his appearance, which it <lb/>
            seems they might do upon tender of three sufficient sureties. The <lb/>
            prosecutor preferred his charge in writing,3 in the same manner as <lb/>
            upon an indictment; and the preparations for trial were in other <lb/>
            respects mostly the same.</p>
          <p>The persons against whom the proceeding by arrest was allowable <lb/>
            were all those whom the Attic law designated as malefactors, such as <lb/>
            robbers, housebreakers, &amp;c.; also those who unlawfully usurped <lb/>
            civic rights, or returned from banishment without permission; those <lb/>
            charged with impiety, pettifoggery, ill-usage of parents or orphans, <lb/>
            and some others. Murder did not subject the party to arrest, unless <lb/>
            it were accompanied with robbery or other atrocious circumstances; <lb/>
            as in the case of Antiphon's client charged with the murder of <lb/>
            Herodes, (see ante, p. 335,) and that of Agoratus, who, having acted <lb/>
            as informer under the Thirty Tyrants, and caused many innocent <lb/>
            Athenians to be put to death, was afterwards apprehended and <lb/>
            prosecuted by Dionysius, brother to one of the sufferers, in conjunc­ <lb/>
            tion with the client of Lysias. But murder stood on a peculiar <lb/>
            footing at Athens, being regarded as an injury to the relatives of the <lb/>
            deceased rather than to the public, though in a religious aspect it <lb/>
            was a pollution to the city; and therefore the accused, as we have <lb/>
            seen, was left commonly at large, and might go into voluntary exile, <lb/>
            if he did not wish to stand his trial.4 <note type="footnote"> (1) When the accuser led the magistrate or his officers to the spot where the <lb/>

            <title type="sub">INFORMATION.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Endeixis, or Information, was pretty much the same course as that <lb/>
            which an Englishman takes, who lays a charge of felony before a <lb/>
            justice of the peace, and obtains his warrant to arrest the felon. <lb/>
            Instead of taking the law into his own hands, as in the process last <lb/>
            mentioned, the Athenian simply put the law in motion by applying to <lb/>
            the proper authority, who, upon receiving the charge in writing, and <lb/>
            seeing that a primd facie case was made out by the informant, was <lb/>
            bound to take measures for apprehending the accused party and <lb/>
            bringing him to trial. The cases to which the Endeixis applied were <lb/>
            the same as those to which the Apagoge did: only in the latter the <lb/>
            prosecutor knew where to find or how to catch the defendant; in the <lb/>
            former he did not know, and therefore left the magistrate to do that <lb/>
            part of the business.</p>
          <p>The proceeding by Information was most frequently and with <lb/>
            peculiar propriety adopted against state-debtors or disfranchised <lb/>
            persons, who exercised the rights from which the law excluded them, <lb/>
            and against exiles who returned home clandestinely without having <lb/>
            procured a revocation of their sentenced It lay also against Presi­ <lb/>
            dentsofthe Council, who neglected to convene the assembly, or to <lb/>
            submit to them the annual revision of the statutes, or to take their <lb/>
            votes upon a question duly brought before them. There are three <lb/>
            extant orations against persons brought to trial by this process: the <lb/>
            Oration of Lysias against Andocides on the subject of the Mysteries, <lb/>
            and those of Demosthenes against Aristogiton and Theocrines, who <lb/>
            are accused of having spoken in the assemblies and courts of justice <lb/>
            before they had paid their debts to the stated</p>

            resembled an Indictment; but the name was specially given to <lb/>
            prosecutions which concerned the revenue; as for offences against <lb/>
            the mine laws or the customs, embezzlement or illegal appropriation <lb/>

              to Athens, were the subject of a Presentment before the Overseers at <lb/>
              the Port. In many of these cases reward or compensation was given <lb/>
              to the successful prosecutor, and therefore, as he was not purely a <lb/>
              vindicator of public justice, but held in some measure the character <lb/>
              of a private plaintiff he had to pay the court fees, and was liable to <lb/>
              a sixth part of the penalty on failure to obtain a fifth of the votes.</p>
          <p>Guardians who defrauded their wards might be presented to the <lb/>
            Archon by any one who had public spirit enough to prosecute. The <lb/>
            law encouraged men to take up the cause of oppressed orphans: the <lb/>
            penalty in such cases was the amount of damage which had been <lb/>
            done, and it went to the orphan, not to the state.</p>
          <p>It seems to have been this peculiarity, viz., that the penalty was <lb/>
            either shared between the state and the prosecutor, or went wholly <lb/>
            to the injured party, which distinguished the process of presentment <lb/>
            from that of indictment. For it is clear from Demosthenes (cont. <lb/>
            Theocrinem, 1324) that the formal proceedings, such as the sum­ <lb/>
            mons of the defendant, the delivery of the charge in writing, and the <lb/>
            preparations for trial, were the same.</p>
          <p>No speech upon a trial of this kind has come down to us, though <lb/>
            the process is often mentioned by the orators, as by Demosthenes <lb/>
            against Theocrines, and Isocrates against Callimachus, (p. 372.)</p>

            <title type="sub">IMPEACHMENT.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Eisangelia, or Impeachment, was a remedy reserved for those <lb/>
            offences which were either not defined by the criminal code, 1 or were <lb/>
            of so heinous and dangerous a character, as to call for an extra­ <lb/>
            ordinary adjudication; such as high crimes against the state, delin­ <lb/>
            quencies by magistrates and persons placed in important trust for the <lb/>
            public. In most countries there have been methods out of the usual <lb/>
            course of law for punishing great and enormous offenders. In England <lb/>
            this has been occasionally effected by bills of pains and penalties; but <lb/>
            the most constitutional process is that of impeachment, which (to <lb/>

              of the whole kingdom,” and is generally adopted against ministers of <lb/>
              the crown or other statesmen who have been guilty of unconstitu­ <lb/>
              tional and corrupt practices. The Athenian process, which we have <lb/>
              designated by the same title, resembled it in this respect, that the ac­ <lb/>
              cusation was presented in the first instance, not to any of the ordinary <lb/>
              magistrates, but either to the sovereign people in assembly, or (whicn <lb/>
              was more usual) to their deputies in the Council; by one or the other <lb/>
              it was usually sent to a judicial tribunal, whose verdict was final.</p>
          <p>When an impeachment was preferred to the Council of Five- <lb/>
            hundred, they first examined the articles (which were required to be <lb/>
            in writing), and, if they thought there was a primâ facie case, they <lb/>
            inquired further into it, in order to satisfy themselves whether they <lb/>
            ought to find a true bill against the accused. If their sentence was <lb/>
            in favour of the impeachment (which was not always arrived at <lb/>
            without a division), they passed a resolution to that effect; of which <lb/>
            their secretary gave notice to the Thesmothetæ, and it became the <lb/>
            duty of those magistrates to bring the case for trial before a jury. <lb/>
            Meanwhile the defendant was given into the custody of the Eleven <lb/>
            and remained in prison, unless the Council chose to accept bail for his <lb/>
            appearance. The Council were themselves competent to impose a <lb/>
            fine not exceeding five hundred drachms; but it rarely happened that <lb/>
            impeachable offences could be thus summarily dealt with.</p>
          <p>If the charge was of such importance as to make it desirable, before <lb/>
            sending it for trial, to obtain the concurrence of the people, the <lb/>
            Council might convene them for that purpose: indeed it was open <lb/>
            to the accuser to prefer his impeachment before the popular assembly <lb/>
            in the first instance; and there was a regular time for doing so, viz., <lb/>
            the first ordinary assembly of each Presidency. The people were <lb/>
            competent, if they pleased, to decide upon the whole question in <lb/>
            assembly; upon the reception of the impeachment, the guilt or inno­ <lb/>
            cence of the accused, and the sentence which he deserved. The most <lb/>
            constitutional course, upon their receiving the impeachment, was, to <lb/>
            order it to be tried before the judicial body, which then generally <lb/>
            consisted of a thousand jurors, presided over by the Thesmothetæ : <lb/>
            and advocates were appointed to assist in the conduct of the prose­ <lb/>
            cution, who were paid a fee of a drachm each from the treasury.1 <lb/>
            But the people, as I have said, might try the case themselves; or <lb/>
            they might direct any special mode of trial. Whatever course was <lb/>
            adopted, a preliminary decree was passed containing the necessary <lb/>
            order. The case of the Generals, who were tried and condemned by <lb/>
            the assembly for their culpability and negligence at Arginusæ, is <lb/>
            thought by Schömann 2 to have been a case of impeachment: yet <note type="footnote"> (1) To this Aristophanes alludes, Vespæ, 691: </note> <figure type="illustration">

              neither Xenophon nor Diodorus in speaking of that event makes use <lb/>
              of the term impeachment, and the proceedings were altogether so <lb/>
              irregular, that we cannot take them as any example of what would <lb/>
              occur in the due course of law.</p>
          <p>Among the instances enumerated as the legitimate subjects of <lb/>
            impeachment are, those of orators or statesmen attempting to over­ <lb/>
            turn the constitution, or giving pernicious counsel to the people—men <lb/>
            going off to the enemy without orders, or betraying the troops, ships, <lb/>
            or garrisons of the country—generals guilty of gross misconduct in <lb/>
            their commando These of course are only examples. It was rea­ <lb/>
            sonable enough, that the people should mark their sense of heinous <lb/>
            crimes against the state by assigning to them extraordinary modes of <lb/>
            trial, even though they might have been reached-as we cannot doubt <lb/>
            that almost every crime at Athens could be reached-by the ordi­ <lb/>
            nary processes of law. Schömann however observes-not without <lb/>
            some Justice-that the inadequacy of the common processes to meet the <lb/>
            exigency of the case was often needlessly urged by vexatious accusers, <lb/>
            who, in bringing crimes of no very serious complexion before the <lb/>
            Council or the Assembly, sought only to secure a prejudice in their <lb/>
            own favour, and to cast an unfair odium upon the adversary. We <lb/>
            have three extant orations upon this kind of trial, and mention of <lb/>
            divers cases by ancient writers; from which we get a little insight <lb/>
            into the Atheman practice.</p>
          <p>Alcibiades was impeached before the Council upon the double <lb/>
            charge of a treasonable conspiracy and of having profaned the Mys­ <lb/>
            teries.2 It had first been made in the assembly, and not favourably <lb/>
            entertained; but afterwards it was renewed in his absence, and ulti­ <lb/>
            matelv sent for trial before a court, which pronounced judgment <lb/>
            against him by default, and sentenced him to death.</p>
          <p>Antiphon, Archeptolemus, and Onomacles were impeached before <lb/>
            the Council, after the deposition of the Oligarchy, of which they had <lb/>
            been active members. The articles against them were-that they <lb/>
            had gone upon a treasonable embassy to Sparta—that they had sailed <lb/>
            in an enemy's ship-and that they had passed through the enemy's <lb/>
            camp at Decelea. The Council passed a special decree, ordering <lb/>
            them to be arrested and tried by a jury; directing that the Thesmo­ <lb/>

            should suffer the penalties of treason. Under this decree they were <lb/>
            tried, the real charge against them being the part which they had <lb/>
            taken in establishing the oligarchy. Antiphon made in his defence <lb/>
            the best speech which had ever been heard liD to that time; so says <lb/>
            Thucydides: (VIII. 68.) They were sentenced to death. Onomacles <lb/>
            escaped. The other two suffered, as already mentioned: (ante, <lb/>
            p. 340.) 1</p>
          <p>The impeachments of Philocrates by Hyperides and of Leocrates <lb/>
            by Lycurgus are familiar to my readers. (See Vol. II. pp. 118, 152, <lb/>
            320, 394.) These and some other examples which have been col­ <lb/>
            lected by the industry of Schömann were clearly proper cases for <lb/>
            a state-trial. Those which I am about to mention can hardly be so <lb/>
            considered.</p>
          <p>One is related in the speech of Demosthenes against Euergus and <lb/>
            Mnesibulus: (1149, &amp;c.) The plaintiff, for whom the oration was <lb/>
            composed, states that he, being a trierarch and superintendent of <lb/>
            a navy-board, went by order of the Council to demand of Theophe­ <lb/>
            mus, a late trierarch, some ship's furniture which he had to return <lb/>
            to the state. Theophemus refusing to deliver up the furniture, he <lb/>
            distrained some of his goods, in doing which he was violently assaulted <lb/>
            and beaten by Theophemus. Upon this he complained to the Council, <lb/>
            who conceiving that the public service was injured by such conduct, <lb/>
            and that the laws as well as the plaintiff had been grossly outraged, <lb/>
            ordered him to prefer an impeachment against the offender. He did <lb/>
            prefer one; the articles of charge were, the refusal to deliver up the <lb/>
            furniture, the rescue of the distress, and the assaulting the plaintiff <lb/>
            in the execution of his duty. Theophemus was commanded to attend <lb/>
            the Council, who, after hearing both sides, gave their votes by ballot <lb/>
            and found him guilty. They were then about to consider, whether <lb/>
            they should fine him to the extent of five hundred drachms, or send <lb/>
            him to be tried by a jury; but upon the earnest intercession of his <lb/>
            friends, upon his handing in an inventory of the furniture, and under­ <lb/>
            taking to refer the private damage to arbitration, the plaintiff con­ <lb/>
            sented that he should be fined only in the moderate sum of twenty-five <lb/>
            drachms.</p>
          <p>Here the importance of protecting a public officer in the execution <lb/>
            of his duty, and the necessity of preventing delays in the naval service, <lb/>
            might induce the Council to look seriously upon the offence of Theo­ <lb/>
            phemus : yet the issue of the affair—and we have only the plaintiff's <lb/>
            statement of it-rather tends to show that he exaggerated it, and <lb/>
            that the Council did not think at last that it was a very grave one. <lb/>
            An impeachment undoubtedly was not necessary: but perhaps the <lb/>
            Council, having executive duties connected with the navy, and being <lb/>
            anxious to provide for its expeditious equipment, strained a point <lb/>
            to accomplish that object. <note type="footnote"> (1) Schömann, De Comitiis, 191. </note> <pb n="364"/>
            </p>
          <p>There is an extant oration of Lysias on behalf of a poor pensioner <lb/>
            of the commonwealth, who, if we can rely upon the title prefixed to the <lb/>
            oration,1 was impeached for having continued to receive his allow­ <lb/>
            ance when he was able to maintain himself. The speech is addressed <lb/>
            to the Council.</p>
          <p>Another of Lysias is against some corn-dealers,2 charged with the <lb/>
            offence of engrossing, i. e. buying up, to sell again, a larger quantity <lb/>
            of corn than was permitted by law. We learn from the speech itself, <lb/>
            that they were first accused before the Council, and afterwards sent <lb/>
            to a jury: from which we may reasonably conjecture that it was a <lb/>
            case of impeachment.</p>
          <p>We learn also that usurpation of civic rights, pettifoggery, and <lb/>
            cowardice in battle, were impeachable offences.3 From all which <lb/>
            examples it appears that most crimes could be prosecuted by impeach­ <lb/>
            ment, notwithstanding .that there were other methods given by the <lb/>
            law, if they were only of sufficiently serious magnitude, either in <lb/>
            themselves or from the position or character of the guilty party. <lb/>
            It depended on the temper of the People or the Council, whether they <lb/>
            would allow it or not. There was a law or practice which in some <lb/>
            measure defined the course of proceeding upon impeachments: yet <lb/>
            this might be departed from or varied at the option of the People, <lb/>
            and sometimes even of the Council, if they deemed it necessary. It <lb/>
            was not uncommon for one or the other to direct what punishment <lb/>
            should follow upon a verdict of conviction.4</p>
          <p>There was one peculiar sort of impeachment, which might be <lb/>
            brought against those who maltreated parents, orphans, or heiresses; <lb/>
            and such was the favour with which the law regarded those parties, <lb/>
            that the accuser who took up their cause (whoever he was, for he <lb/>
            might be any Athenian) neither paid any fee, nor incurred any penalty <lb/>
            if he lost the verdict. On the other hand, a conviction of the accused <lb/>
            might be attended with capital sentence; 5 so that we presume, this <lb/>
            course was not resorted to except in cases of flagrant oppression. <lb/>
            This kind of impeachment however was preferred, not to the Council, <lb/>
            but to the Archon, who had cognizance of indictments for the same <lb/>
            offence. The difference therefore seems to have lain rather in the <lb/>
            advantage given to the prosecutor and the consequences of the ver­ <lb/>
            dict, than In the course of the proceedings; and, as far as we can <lb/>
            perceive, there was a want of congruity in assigning this title to the <lb/>
            accusation so preferred.6 <note type="footnote"> (1) It is entitled <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπὲρ του̃ ἀδυνάτον, πρὸς τὴν εἰσαγγελίαν</foreign> wept To? <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴ διδόσθαι τψ̄</foreign> </note> <figure type="illustration">

            <title type="sub">PLAINT TO THE ASSEMBLY.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Of this proceeding, which the Athenians called Probole, and for <lb/>
            which it is impossible to find any corresponding term in the English <lb/>
            law, the reader has got some knowledge from the Oration against <lb/>
            MEdias. It was an application to the People in assembly for leave to <lb/>
            prefer a criminal charge, and was reserved for certain cases in which, <lb/>
            either from their importance to the community, or on account of the <lb/>
            rank and station of the offenders, it was desirable to obtain the popu­ <lb/>
            lar sanction to the prosecution. It may seem strange that there <lb/>
            should be another way of effecting an object, the attainment of which <lb/>
            was amply provided for by the method of impeachment: and this is <lb/>
            an example among others, illustrating the disposition of the Athenians <lb/>
            to multiply legal forms. Nevertheless, between the Plaint to the <lb/>
            Assembly and the Impeachment preferred to the same body there <lb/>
            was not a mere nominal distinction. For upon an Impeachment the <lb/>
            people might themselves pronounce final judgment, without sending <lb/>
            it to another tribunal; or they might order a particular mode of <lb/>
            trial or punishment: whereas upon a Plaint, if they decided against <lb/>
            the accused party, they directed only that he should be tried in the <lb/>
            usual way; which was by a jury before the Thesmothetæ. The chief <lb/>
            advantage of this course was one which attended an impeachment— <lb/>
            viz., that it created a prejudice against the accused: for, though the <lb/>
            decision of the Assembly was not in point of law binding upon the <lb/>
            jury, it could hardly fail to exercise an influence over their minds. <lb/>
            The trial also was attended with no risk to the prosecutor. 1</p>
          <p>The principal cases in which it appears that this process could be <lb/>
            resorted to were-charges against magistrates for official misconduct <lb/>
            or oppression-charges against persons who profaned any of the <lb/>
            solemn festivals by indecent outrage or disturbance-charges against <lb/>
            pettifogging orators and informers. Some others are noticed by the <lb/>
            grammarians; viz., charges of disaffection to the state, and clandes­ <lb/>
            tine working of the public mines: and Demosthenes in the Oration <lb/>
            against Midias mentions a case of embezzlement which was brought by <lb/>
            Plaint before the Assembly: (ante, p. 135.)</p>
          <p>The second of the abovementioned cases is the one which is most <lb/>
            familiar to us, owing to the Oration against Midias, from which we <lb/>
            derive considerable information as to the practice. I shall content <lb/>
            myself with referring to those passages which relate to it: (ante, <lb/>
            pp. 66, 67, 124, 125.)</p>
          <p>As regards the charge of pettifoggery, it is probable, as Schömann <lb/>
            suggests, that recourse would be had to the Plaint in those instances, <note type="footnote"> (1) See what I have said under title <foreign xml:lang="grc">Προβολὴ</foreign> in the Archaeological Dictionary; <lb/>
            and Schömann, De Comitiis, 227, &amp;c. </note> <lb/>

            where men had to deal with artful and influential orators, who threat­ <lb/>
            ened to be dangerous opponents, unless the popular voice could be en­ <lb/>
            listed in aid of the prosecution.1 An example of the kind is reported, <lb/>
            which is singular in one respect, that the proposal to accuse emanated <lb/>
            from the people themselves. It occurred soon after the execution of the <lb/>
            generals who won the battle of Arginusæ. The Athenians, repenting <lb/>
            of the wrong which had been done them, passed a vote in assembly, <lb/>
            that those who had misled the people should have Plaints preferred <lb/>
            against them, and should give bail for their appearance. In pursu­ <lb/>
            ance of this vote Callixenus (who was expressly named) and four <lb/>
            others were accused, and kept in custody by their sureties; but they <lb/>
            contrived to escape. Amid the calamities which ensued the matter <lb/>
            was suffered to drop; and of the rest we learn nothing further; but <lb/>
            Callixenus, venturing to return to Athens after the expulsion of the <lb/>
            Thirty Tyrants, was held in such universal detestation, that he was <lb/>
            left to die of hunger.2</p>
          <p>In connexion with the processes above enumerated grammarians <lb/>
            mention Apographe and Docimasia, which however stand on a somewhat <lb/>
            different footing from the others. Apographe was giving information <lb/>
            of property belonging to the state, or liable to be seized by the state, <lb/>
            of which I have already spoken in the present Appendix: (ante, <lb/>
            p. 341.) This, strictly speaking, was not the institution of a criminal <lb/>
            proceeding: for, if the holder of the property admitted the informa­ <lb/>
            ion to be correct, possession was taken by the public officers, and <lb/>
            there was an end of the matter. If the public right was disputed, <lb/>
            litigation ensued between the holder or claimant of the property on <lb/>
            the one hand, and the informer acting in the state's behalf on the <lb/>
            other; and then the term Apographe, which properly signified only the <lb/>
            schedule or specification of the property liable to be seized, was <lb/>
            applied in a more extended sense to the quasi-criminal cause which <lb/>
            arose out of it.3</p>
          <p>Docimasia was the probation of magistrates and other functionaries <lb/>
            before they were admitted to their official duties. Any citizen might <lb/>
            object that the party on his probation was for some reason or other <lb/>
            unfit to hold office. The grounds of objection, if persisted in, were <lb/>
            examined either by the Council or by the Court of Justice; and, <lb/>
            if they were satisfactorily proved, the accused party was rejected. The <lb/>
            probation itself was in most cases a mere matter of form, necessary to <note type="footnote"> (1) Schömann, De Comitiis, 233. lacerates in a passage before cited, (De Antid. <lb/>

              be gone through by all persons elected to offices, but not involving <lb/>
              any criminal inquiry, unless accusers came forward with the object of <lb/>
              effecting their exclusion.1 The like opportunity was afforded at the <lb/>
              first regular assembly of each Presidency, when the people were asked <lb/>
              whether they were satisfied with the conduct of their present magis­ <lb/>
              trates ; 2 upon which complaints of misconduct might be preferred <lb/>
              by any citizen, and these, if it became necessary, were brought to <lb/>
              trial by the Archons.3</p>
          <p>There was however an extraordinary kind of probation, not of <lb/>
            magistrates, but of orators, which might be called for at any time <lb/>
            by an accuser undertaking to prove that for one or more of certain <lb/>
            crimes they ought to be disfranchised. It has already been mentioned <lb/>
            that, if any person who had been actually disfranchised was seen <lb/>
            to speak in the assembly or courts of justice, he might be proceeded <lb/>
            against by information and attachment. But there was a certain <lb/>
            class of crimes, for which the penalty upon conviction was disfran­ <lb/>
            chisement—such were the striking of a parent, cowardice in battle, <lb/>
            unnatural practices, and some others-the mere commission of which <lb/>
            (before conviction) justified a proceeding of the following kind. If <lb/>
            the guilty party attempted to speak in the assembly or court, it was <lb/>
            competent for any citizen to give notice that he should call for <lb/>
            a scrutiny into his life and character,4 and was prepared to prove that <lb/>
            he had committed one or more of those particular crimes. Upon such <lb/>
            notice having been formally given, the Thesmothetæ took the neces­ <lb/>
            sary steps for bringing the case before a jury, which was then tried <lb/>
            precisely in the same way as if it had been brought forward by indict­ <lb/>
            ment. Upon the conviction of the accused his disqualification was <lb/>
            established.5 It was thus that Æschines obtained the disfranchise­ <lb/>
            ment of Timarchus, when he was preparing in conjunction with Demo­ <lb/>
            thenes to prosecute him. (See the Argument to the Oration on the <lb/>
            Embassy.)</p>
          <p>The preparation for trial and the trial itself were conducted pretty <lb/>
            much in the same way in criminal as in civil causes; and the expla­ <lb/>
            nation of them will therefore be deferred to the next Appendix. <lb/>

          <p>The penalty of crime was sometimes fixed by the law, but more <lb/>

            lair punishable with death; malicious wounding with banishment and <note type="footnote"> (1) See Meier and Schömann, Att. Proc. 200, &amp;c. Schömann, Ant. Jur. Publ. <lb/>

              the fraudulent entry of a debt in the public register, the culprit <lb/>
              was made debtor in lieu of the aggrieved party. In these and the <lb/>
              like cases, when the defendant was found guilty, the jury had <lb/>
              nothing further to do: the penalty of the law followed their verdict. <lb/>
              Upon impeachments also, where the council or the assembly had <lb/>
              declared what punishment should attend conviction, the jury had no <lb/>
              power to impose any other. In the great majority of cases however <lb/>
              -as in prosecutions for theft, bribery, outrage, impiety, adultery, <lb/>
              maltreatment of parents and orphans, moving illegal decrees, em­ <lb/>
              bezzlement of public money, &amp;c. &amp;c.-the penalty was not fixed or <lb/>
              declared beforehand; and the jury who found the defendant guilty, <lb/>
              had to pass sentence upon him by a second verdict.1</p>
          <p>But how was this to be done ? No such plan was adopted as in <lb/>
            our own country, where, when the law does not declare the sentence <lb/>
            (as it does in treason and murder), it confers upon the judge a certain <lb/>
            range of discretionary power, naming always the maximum and <lb/>
            sometimes also the minimum of punishment which may be inflicted. <lb/>
            Here, as in other instances, we find how much was left to the discre­ <lb/>
            tion of the prosecutor at Athens. It was his duty to name a penalty <lb/>
            in the indictment or other instrument of accusation which he pre­ <lb/>
            ferred to the magistrate. Upon the conviction of his opponent, he <lb/>
            was called upon to address the jury in support of the proposed <lb/>
            penalty, unless he chose to name a more lenient one, which it was <lb/>
            competent for him to do with leave of the court. To this he might <lb/>
            be led either by a merciful feeling on his own part, or by the solicita­ <lb/>
            tion of the defendant or his friends; or he might be guided by an <lb/>
            expression of feeling on the part of the jury; who frequently during <lb/>
            the trial of a cause gave token of their favour or disfavour by <lb/>
            gestures, murmurs, and clamour. The prosecutor, having made the <lb/>
            proposal which he elected to abide by, addressed the jury with such <lb/>
            arguments in support of it as he deemed necessary. The defendant <lb/>
            was then allowed to speak in mitigation of punishment; but he was <lb/>
            required to make some counter-proposition, and to name the penalty <lb/>
            which he was content to suffer. 2 Friends often spoke in his behalf, <lb/>
            extenuating his offence, or appealing to the mercy of the court; and <lb/>
            it was a common thing for a man, who thought himself in great peril, <lb/>
            to produce his wife and children at the bar, in order to excite com­ <lb/>
            passion.' <note type="footnote"> (1) See Meier and Schömann, Att.

              </p>
          <p>Between the two proposals of the contending parties the jury had <lb/>
            to decide, and to choose one of them. As to this point there has <lb/>
            been a difference of opinion among writers on Attic law. It does at first <lb/>
            seem strange, that the jury had no power to adopt a middle course, <lb/>
            and to pass what sentence they thought reasonable, irrespective <lb/>
            of what the parties offered to their choice. A little reflexion however <lb/>
            will convince us, that it could not well be otherwise with a jury <lb/>
            so constituted as the Athenian. We know that an English jury of <lb/>
            only twelve men, who can put their heads together and confer, find <lb/>
            it difficult often to decide upon the question of damages. One man <lb/>
            proposes this sum, and one that.; and after a long discussion the <lb/>
            dispute is ended by splitting the difference in some way or other. But <lb/>
            how could this be done at Athens with a panel of two or three hundred <lb/>
            jurors, and sometimes five hundred or a thousand? A discussion <lb/>
            among so many, whether the penalty should be death or banishment <lb/>
            or a fine of ten or twenty talents or more or less, would have led to <lb/>
            inextricable confusion. It could not have taken place except aloud <lb/>
            and openly, and would almost have required a regular debate, which <lb/>
            must nave occupied a considerable time. We have no mention of any <lb/>
            such thing in the Attic writers; indeed we have no evidence that the <lb/>
            jury ever conferred at all. With respect to their first verdict, there <lb/>
            could be no use in a conference, when it was decided by a majority of <lb/>
            votes. But the second verdict was given in like manner. The <lb/>
            ballot excludes the notion of their coming to an agreement, and <lb/>
            is hardly compatible with the supposition that each juror might pro­ <lb/>
            pose a sentence, but is quite consistent with their deciding between <lb/>
            the proposals of the two adversaries.</p>
          <p>That some inconvenience as well as injustice was occasioned by <lb/>
            this plan is not to be doubted. Yet we must not suppose it was a <lb/>
            common practice to present widely different estimates to the jury, <lb/>
            so as to leave them no alternative between the extreme of severity <lb/>
            and the extreme of lenity. The difficulty was usually avoided by the <lb/>
            prudence or moderation of the parties, or by an arrangement between <lb/>
            them or their friends. The prosecutor might always apprehend that, <lb/>
            if he laid the penalty too high, the jury would take compassion on his <lb/>
            opponent; while the defendant might fear to irritate them by putting <lb/>
            it too low. The trial afforded to both an opportunity of feeling the <lb/>
            pulse of the jury. If they appeared to be greatly incensed against <lb/>
            the defendant, the prosecutor might safely ask for a severe punish­ <lb/>
            ment : if they were not so, it was prudent to relax in his demand. <lb/>
            Similar views would prevent the defendant from asking for too light a <lb/>
            penalty, or would induce him to effect a compromise. The friends were <lb/>
            allowed to consult. Entreaties passed from one to the other in the <lb/>
            hearing of the jurors, who (except in heinous cases where public <lb/>
            justice demanded severity) were favourable to such arrangements, <lb/>
            and gave the parties time to adjust them. Thus the very dilemma in <lb/>
            which the adversaries were placed would often incline them to be <note type="footnote"> VOL. IIL </note> <note type="footnote"> B B </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="370"/>
            reasonable. That on some occasions they should be obstinate and <lb/>
            refuse to accommodate each other, was also from the nature of things <lb/>
            to be expected.1</p>
          <p>A few examples will illustrate the course of proceeding.</p>
          <p>It is mentioned in the Oration against Midias (ante, p. 124) that, <lb/>
            when Evander had been convicted of profaning the Mysteries, the <lb/>
            jury showed an inclination to pass a capital sentence upon him, but, <lb/>
            Menippus the prosecutor having accepted terms of compromise, they <lb/>
            were satisfied with fining him.</p>
          <p>Arethusius was convicted by Apollodorus of having sworn falsely <lb/>
            to a summons. The penalty of death was proposed by the prose. <lb/>
            cutor; a fine of a talent by the defendant. The jury were about to <lb/>
            divide, and (says the speaker) "they would have passed sentence of <lb/>
            death, but I entreated the jury, rather than they should do anything <lb/>
            of the sort through me, to accept the penalty offered by my oppo­ <lb/>
            nent." (Demosthenes, cont. Nicostratum, 1252, 1254.)</p>
          <p>The same Apollodorus was indicted by Stephanus for having pro­ <lb/>
            posed that decree, which would have enabled the Athenians to apply <lb/>
            the surplus of their revenue to the carrying on of a necessary war, <lb/>
            instead of lavishing it on public amusements. The penalty was laid <lb/>
            at fifteen talents. Stephanus was requested to lower it, but in vain: <lb/>
            he insisted on going to the jury for the full amount. The jury <lb/>
            divided, and imposed a fine of one talent. Theomnestus, son-in-law <lb/>
            of Apollodorus, relates this on the trial of Neæra, and bitterly com­ <lb/>
            plains of the peril which Apollodorus had been made to incur. The <lb/>
            peril consisted in this; that the jury had no other choice, than <lb/>
            between the fifteen talents of Stephanus and the single talent offered <lb/>
            by Apollodorus. (See the Oration against Neæra, 1347.)</p>
          <p>The like complaint is made in the Oration against Theocrines: (ad <lb/>
            finem.) Theocrines had procured the conviction of the speaker's <lb/>
            father, and proposed a fine of ten talents. He withstood all entreaties <lb/>
            to make a reduction, and the defendant was sentenced to pay the ten <lb/>
            talents. The son afterwards prosecutes Theocrines to revenge his <lb/>
            father, and assigns this cruelty as his principal motive.</p>
          <p>The story of Socrates, as told in Plato's Apologia, affords another <lb/>
            illustration. He having been tried on a charge of impiety, and con­ <lb/>
            victed by a majority of three votes, Melitus, his accuser, proposed <lb/>
            that he should be punished with death. Socrates, when it came to <lb/>
            his turn to say what punishment he deserved, first declares that he <lb/>
            ought to be entertained in the public dining-hall as a reward for his <lb/>
            services; then, (to comply with the form of law,) he offers one mina, <lb/>
            saying, that was all he could afford to pay; but shortly after (at the <lb/>
            earnest request of friends) he names thirty minas, for which they <lb/>
            offer to be bail. The jury look upon this behaviour as an insult to <note type="footnote"> (1) This subject is fully treated of in my article <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τίμημα</foreign> in the Archaeological <lb/>
            Dictionary. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="371"/>
            the court, and pass sentence of death upon him. Some of them, <lb/>
            who had voted for his acquittal, voted for the capital punishment.</p>
          <p>The general rule was, that only one penalty could be imposed by <lb/>
            the court, as we learn from the Oration against Leptines: (ante, <lb/>
            p. 52.) In certain -cases however the jury were empowered by <lb/>
            statute to inflict an extra penalty; as for instance, imprisonment <lb/>
            besides a fine; which any individual juror was at liberty to propose. <lb/>
            Here there would be no difficulty. The law specified now the party <lb/>
            might be punished; and the jury divided upon the single question, <lb/>
            whether the extra punishment should be inflicted or not.</p>
          <p>The verdict of condemnation, whatever it was, having been de­ <lb/>
            clared by the presiding magistrate, was duly entered on record. The <lb/>
            next thing for us to consider is-</p>
          <p>IV. The execution of the sentence.</p>
          <p>The manner in which this was enforced depended on the nature of <lb/>
            the case.2</p>
          <p>If the sentence were death or imprisonment, the presiding <lb/>
            magistrate gave notice thereof to the Eleven, who took the necessary <lb/>
            steps to see it inflicted.</p>
          <p>If a man was condemned to slavery, he was handed over to the <lb/>
            Poletæ, or Commissioners of public sales, who forthwith sold him for <lb/>
            a slave to the highest bidder.</p>
          <p>Banishment was left to be executed by the party himself, who was <lb/>
            bound to quit the country within the prescribed period. If he failed <lb/>
            to do so, or if he returned without permission, he was punishable <lb/>
            with death; and any one who harboured him was liable to the same <lb/>
            fate.</p>
          <p>A disfranchised person had to abstain from exercising the privileges <lb/>
            which he had forfeited. If he attempted to do otherwise, he might <lb/>
            be proceeded against immediately by information and attachment.</p>
          <p>Upon sentence of confiscation, whether combined with other <lb/>
            punishment or not, it became the duty of the Demarch (or chief <lb/>
            officer of the defendant's township), sometimes of the Eleven, and <lb/>
            sometimes of special Inquisitors, to discover what goods and effects <lb/>
            he had, that were liable to be seized by the state, and to furnish an <lb/>
            inventory of them to the Poletæ. Any private individual might give <lb/>
            the like information, as we have seen (ante, p. 341), and the prosecutor <lb/>
            was usually on the alert to enforce the law. Inventories thus taken <lb/>
            of confiscated property were read in the first regular assembly of <lb/>
            each Presidency, that all parties who had any claim might have due <lb/>
            notice.</p>
          <p>When a fine was imposed, the magistrate who tried the cause gave <lb/>
            notice of it to the Practores or Collectors, whose business it was to <lb/>
            enter it forthwith in the public register, and to demand payment. <note type="footnote"> (1) The juror making the proposal was said <foreign xml:lang="grc">προστιμα̃σθαι</foreign>,the whole jury voting <lb/>
            for the extra penalty, <foreign xml:lang="grc">προστιμα̃ν</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) Upon the whole of this subject, see Meier and Schömann, Att. Proc. 739, &amp;c. </note> <note type="footnote"> B B 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="372"/>
            When the fine or any part of it went to a temple, notice was sent <lb/>
            also to the Treasurers of the God or Goddess to whom the temple <lb/>
            belonged. The money, when paid to the Collectors, was handed over <lb/>
            by them to the Apodectæ or Receivers, or to the Treasurers of the <lb/>
            temple, as the case might be; and the name of the debtor was then <lb/>
            erased from the register. If the fine was unpaid after the expiration <lb/>
            of the ninth Presidency, or, in case it were imposed for a personal <lb/>
            outrage, for eleven days after the entry in the register, it was <lb/>
            doubled, and an entry made accordingly. During the whole time that <lb/>
            it remained unpaid, the debtor was excluded from the enjoyment of <lb/>
            his civic rights, and was liable also to imprisonment. If he died with­ <lb/>
            out satisfying it, the disfranchisement extended to his children.1</p>
          <p>As to applications for a new trial and relief against unjust verdicts, <lb/>
            I must refer to the Appendix following.</p>

          <p>WHAT has been said concerning the presidency of different magis­ <lb/>
            trates in judicial proceedings at Athens, applies to civil causes as <lb/>
            well as to criminal. Almost all important civil jurisdiction belonged <lb/>
            to the Archons. We have seen how the chief Archon had cognizance <lb/>
            of inheritance causes, and disputes concerning family rights between <lb/>
            citizen and citizen: (ante, p. 256,)—the King-archon, of disputes con­ <lb/>
            cerning priesthoods and sacerdotal privileges: (p. 258,)—the Pole­ <lb/>
            march, of those which concerned the personal or family rights of <lb/>
            aliens: (p. 259,)—while the Thesmothetæ, or Judges strictly so called, <lb/>
            had the most extensive jurisdiction, embracing all that was not spe­ <lb/>
            cially assigned to others: (p. 260.) Before the Generals came disputes <lb/>
            connected with the property-tax and the trierarchy. (Meier and <lb/>
            Schömann, Att. Proc. 550.) The forty itinerant judges tried certain <lb/>
            cases of assault and trespass to goods. Of them and of the arbitra­ <lb/>
            tors I shall speak elsewhere.</p>
          <p>I am now about to explain the proceedings in a civil action.</p>
          <p>The general idea of an action is a suit at law, in which there is <lb/>
            a plaintiff and a defendant. Such, in a narrow sense of the term, is <lb/>
            the meaning of <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίκη</foreign>. But there were divers causes at Athens, in <lb/>
            which (strictly speaking) there was neither plaintiff nor defendant, <lb/>
            but all the parties were similarly situated with respect to the subject <lb/>
            of contest: for example, when adverse claims were made to an in­ <lb/>
            heritance or an heiress; or when families or individuals went to law <lb/>
            about a priesthood or its appendant privileges; or upon disputes <note type="footnote"> (1) See article <foreign xml:lang="grc">πράκτορες</foreign> in the Archaeological Dictionary; Böckh's Public <lb/>
            Economy of Athens, Tranal. ii. 119, &amp;c. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="373"/>
            concerning the trierarchy or any other of the official services, where <lb/>
            each of the parties sought relief from the burden on the plea that his <lb/>
            adversary was better able than himself to discharge it: a cause of <lb/>
            this kind was termed in law <foreign xml:lang="grc">διαδικασία</foreign>, which I have translated <lb/>
            Interpleader.1</p>
          <p>Actions again were of two kinds, <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίκαι, κατά τινος</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίκαι πρός <lb/>
            τινα</foreign>. The former were actions for breaches of obligations ex delicto; <lb/>
            as actions for assault and battery, trespass, evil-speaking, theft, breach <lb/>
            of trust. The latter included actions for breaches of obligation ex <lb/>
            contractu, and actions to recover specific property; as an action of <lb/>
            debt, or upon a contract to pay a certain sum of money; or an action <lb/>
            to recover a house, or a slave, or any goods and chattels taken or <lb/>
            detained from the owner. This distinction, which is purely one of <lb/>
            terms, has some degree of uncertainty about it; nor does it exactly <lb/>
            correspond with any which we have in our own law; yet it is worthy <lb/>
            to be noticed, as one of the niceties of Athenian forensic practiced</p>
          <p>That no one could be the plaintiff in a civil action except the party <lb/>
            whose rights were to be recovered or wrongs redressed, is obvious of <lb/>
            itself. A woman however could only regularly commence an action <lb/>
            through her legal protector, (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κύριος</foreign>,) either her husband or nearest <lb/>
            relative; a minor through his guardian; a resident alien through his <lb/>
            patron. (Att. Proc. Book IV. Chap. 1.)</p>
          <p>The ordinary course of a lawsuit was as follows:-</p>
          <p>The plaintiff summoned the defendant to appear before the magis­ <lb/>
            trate. On the day of appearance he preferred his plaint in writing. <lb/>
            The magistrate inquired into the nature of the case, examined the <lb/>
            parties, and, if he thought the action properly brought, required the <lb/>
            defendant to plead. The court fees were paid. A day was usually <lb/>
            appointed for a further examination and for the production of evidence. <lb/>
            The depositions of witnesses were then taken. These and all other <lb/>
            evidentiary documents were kept safe by the magistrate until the day <lb/>
            of trial. For that day a jury was summoned; the magistrate and the <lb/>
            parties attended; plaintiff and defendant addressed the jury in turn, <lb/>
            and their evidence was read by the clerk or usher of the court, each <lb/>
            witness being present to support his testimony. At the close of the <lb/>
            case the jury were called upon to find their verdict, which they did <lb/>
            by ballot, either for the plaintiff or the defendant. If damages had <lb/>
            to be assessed, they divided again for that purpose. Their verdict <lb/>
            upon both questions was declared and recorded by the magistrate, <lb/>
            who presided in court during the whole time.</p>
          <p>Such is an outline of an Athenian lawsuit, when it proceeded regu­ <lb/>
            larly, without any default or dilatory measures on either side. We <lb/>
            must now examine it more in detail. <note type="footnote"> (1) See Meier and Schömann, Att. Proc. 367, 465, 471. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) Isæus says, et ðè <foreign xml:lang="grc">μήτε πρὸς ἐμἐ μἠτε κατ̛ ἐμου̃ δίκην ει̉ναί τψ̃ παιδί</foreign>. Cited <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>The summons in an action was effected in the same way as upon <lb/>
            an indictment, by verbally desiring the defendant to attend before <lb/>
            the magistrate on a particular day, commonly about the fifth day from <lb/>
            the summons. The plaintiff seems to have been restricted in his <lb/>
            choice of a day, inasmuch as certain days were appointed by Jaw for <lb/>
            appearance,-as the last of the month in actions of debt:1 and no <lb/>
            feast-days could be selected for such a purpose, not to mention those <lb/>
            which were devoted to other important business, (Att. Proc. 577 <lb/>
            —580.)</p>
          <p>Of the witnesses to the summons I have already spoken: (ante, p. <lb/>
            357.) Arrest was not allowed in civil actions, except in the case of <lb/>
            aliens, who might be held to bail. (Att. Proc. 580.)</p>
          <p>The defendant could not appear by attorney, nor was appearance <lb/>
            a mere form (as with us) by entry in a court book. He was obliged <lb/>
            to attend in person before the magistrate, to answer the complaint <lb/>
            preferred against him. If he did not attend, and the plaintiff could <lb/>
            prove that he had been duly summoned, he was liable to suffer judg­ <lb/>
            ment by default.2</p>
          <p>On the day of appearance the plaintiff exhibited his bill of plaint3 <lb/>
            to the magistrate, and was questioned by him concerning it. 'The <lb/>
            magistrate had then several things to consider; viz. whether he him­ <lb/>
            self had jurisdiction in the cause; whether the plaintiff was a com­ <lb/>
            petent person to bring an action; whether the action was brought <lb/>
            at a proper time and in a proper form; and lastly, whether in point <lb/>
            of law there was any right of action at all.</p>
          <p>For example, if a man had brought an action of debt before the <lb/>
            Archon, the Archon would say to him—" You have come to the <lb/>
            wrong person; I cannot entertain this case; you must summon the <lb/>
            party before the Thesmothetæ."</p>
          <p>Or if a woman or a minor had taken proceedings without the aid <lb/>
            of a guardian or prochein amy, the magistrate would not suffer the <lb/>
            case to go on, until the form of the law were complied with in that <lb/>
            respect.</p>
          <p>An action might be commenced at a wrong period. Thus, mercantile <note type="footnote"> (1) See Aristophanes, Nubes, 1189.-</note> <figure type="illustration">

              suits were confined by law to the six winter months, and the magistrate <lb/>
              had no power to entertain one in any other month. (Att. Proc. 579.)</p>
          <p>The plaint was required also to be in the legal and proper form: <lb/>
            if not, it was the magistrate's duty to direct an amendment, (Ibid. <lb/>
            601.) In these and in all matters of a technical and formal nature <lb/>
            the magistrate exercised an undisputed authority, and was (both in <lb/>
            theory and practice) the sole judge.</p>
          <p>Upon the last question alSo-whether the plaintiff had any right <lb/>
            of action-there is no doubt that in the theory of the law the ma­ <lb/>
            gistrate had full power to decide in the first instance, and at once to <lb/>
            quash all farther proceedings, if it appeared by the plaintiff's own <lb/>
            statement of his case that there was no legal ground of complaint. <lb/>
            He was subject however to a check, which in practice greatly con­ <lb/>
            trolled his authority. He might at any time be accused of corruption <lb/>
            or misconduct, especially at the end of his official year, when he had <lb/>
            to render an account of his administration. Any persons might then <lb/>
            come forward, and allege, that by reason of his neglect they had been <lb/>
            prevented from obtaining justice. When the democracy became con­ <lb/>
            firmed, and the people fond of exercising their judicial powers, they <lb/>
            looked with jealousy upon any person who restrained them; and the <lb/>
            complaint of a disappointed suitor would be readily attended to. It <lb/>
            might be urged also with some show of reason that, as juries were <lb/>
            constituted judges of the law as well as the fact, any decision by a <lb/>
            magistrate upon matters of substance in the cause was premature. <lb/>
            Thus it became a delicate thing for him to interpose between the <lb/>
            suitor and his rights; and, with respect to essential points, his duty <lb/>
            was rather ministerial than judicial.</p>
          <p>There might indeed be cases in which the law was so clear against <lb/>
            the plaintiff, that it would not be safe for the magistrate to proceed. <lb/>
            He would then be imperatively bound to follow his own judgment, <lb/>
            and quash the suit.1</p>
          <p>If he saw no objection to the progress of the cause, he intimated <lb/>
            the same to the parties, and appointed a day for a hearing. Then was <lb/>
            the action considered to have formally commenced, this being the first <lb/>
            step taken by the court. The allowance of the action by the magis­ <lb/>
            trate was like our issuing the writ of summons, which commands the <lb/>
            defendant to appear.2</p>
          <p>A short abstract of the plaint was then written upon a board in <note type="footnote"> ' (1) A case is mentioned in the Oration against Lacritus (p. 941), which the <lb/>

              obtain a judicial hearing; and still more strictly, to obtain it by lot, which arose <lb/>
              probably from this, that, when there were several causes, the magistrate cast lots for <lb/>
              the order in which they were to be taken. The expression would remain when the <lb/>
              practice was given up. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Λαγχάνειν</foreign> has indeed shared the fate of many other words, <lb/>
              in losing a portion of its original meaning, and is applied to a variety of objects in <lb/>

              chalk, and hung up in the magistrate's office, or in some conspicuous <lb/>
              place outside, to inform all persons interested, that a cause between <lb/>
              such and such parties was pending. A copy of it was also kept in <lb/>
              the record office in the temple of Cybele. (See Att. Proc. 605, 606.)</p>
          <p>The plaint was brief and simple, if we may judge from the few <lb/>
            forms that have been preserved to us; though perhaps hardly one of <lb/>
            them is perfect. Demosthenes gives us the form in the action for <lb/>
            false testimony brought by Apollodorus against Stephanus : (p. 1115.)</p>
          <p>"Apollodorus son of Pasion of Acharnæ against Stephanus son of <lb/>
            Menecles of Acharnæ. Damages one talent. Stephanus gave false <lb/>
            testimony against me, to wit, that which is written in the deposition."</p>
          <p>The deposition itself was most probably annexed.</p>
          <p>In the suit against Aphobus it began thus: (853.)</p>
          <p>" Demosthenes makes this complaint against Aphobus. Aphobus <lb/>
            is indebted to me for monies had and received by him as guardian, <lb/>
            (that is to say,) eighty minas which he received as the marriage por­ <lb/>
            tion of my mother pursuant to the will of my father."</p>
          <p>This was the first item of his demand, which amounted altogether <lb/>
            to ten talents. Demosthenes takes credit to himself for not having <lb/>
            laid the damages in one general sum, but given full particulars of his <lb/>
            claim; from which we may perhaps infer, that it was not the common <lb/>
            practice so to do.</p>
          <p>The form of a plaint preferred by Dinarchus against Proxenus <lb/>
            for the loss of money and goods, which he charged the defendant <lb/>
            with having secreted or taken away from him, is preserved by Dio­ <lb/>
            nysius: (De Dinarcho Judicium, 635.)</p>
          <p>" Dinarchus son of Sostratus of Corinth against Proxenus, with <lb/>
            whom I dwell, for damage, two talents. Proxenus hath injured me, <lb/>
            for that, having received into his house in the country, when I <lb/>
            returned from Chalets after my exile from Athens, two hundred and <lb/>
            eighty-five staters of gold, which I brought from Chalets with the <lb/>
            knowledge of Proxenus, and took with me into his house, together <lb/>
            with silver plate of the value of not less than twenty minas, he laid <lb/>
            a scheme to deprive me of them."</p>
          <p>At this stage of the proceedings the magistrate demanded payment <lb/>
            of the court fees (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πρντανει̑α</foreign>), which were computed on a certain <lb/>
            scale according to the amount of damages claimed. If the damages <lb/>
            were from a hundred to a. thousand drachms, the fees were three <lb/>
            drachms for each party; if from a thousand to ten thousand, thirty <lb/>
            drachms; and so on. There were no fees however in actions for <lb/>
            assault and battery; the object of which might be, to encourage <lb/>
            parties to seek legal redress rather than take the law into their own <lb/>
            hands: and none in any causes under a hundred drachms.</p>
          <p>The plaintiff was required to pay his share of the fees before the <lb/>
            cause could be set down for hearing; the defendant most likely <lb/>
            before his plea could be received. All fees were paid by the magis­ <lb/>
            trate to the public treasury, and helped to defray the expenses of <lb/>
             <pb n="377"/>
            the court and jury. The successful party was reimbursed by the <lb/>
            loser.</p>
          <p>From the ordinary court fees we must distinguish the deposit <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">παρακταβολὴ</foreign>), which was required in some cases as security <lb/>
            against a frivolous demand. Two instances are particularly men­ <lb/>
            tioned : first, where a man claimed property which had been con­ <lb/>
            fiscated by the state, and deposited a fifth of its value; secondly, <lb/>
            where a man claimed an inheritance which had been already adjudged <lb/>
            to another, and deposited a tenth of the value, to be paid to his <lb/>
            opponent if successful.</p>
          <p>(See Att. Proc. Book IV. Chap. 4.)</p>
          <p>On the appointed day the parties again attended before the <lb/>
            magistrate, whose duty it now was to receive the defendants plea, <lb/>
            and to hear the case fully on both sides, in order to prepare it for <lb/>
            trial.1</p>
          <p>In most systems of forensic practice some method has been devised <lb/>
            for bringing the disputes of the parties to an intelligible issue, so <lb/>
            that, before they go into court, it may appear on the face of the pro­ <lb/>
            ceedings what are the questions to be tried. This in English law is <lb/>
            called the pleading, in a restricted sense of that term, and is exceed­ <lb/>
            ingly complex and artificial, notwithstanding many attempts which <lb/>
            have been made to simplify and improve it. Between our practice <lb/>
            and the Athenian one point of difference is this-that with us the <lb/>
            pleading is for the most part carried on privately in the chambers of <lb/>
            the lawyers, resort being had to the court or to a judge only occa­ <lb/>
            sionally, when some dignus vindice nodus is to be solved: whereas <lb/>
            the Athenian pleading (which, as we might expect, was a much <lb/>
            simpler affair) was conducted entirely under the superintendence of <lb/>
            the magistrate.</p>
          <p>Both parties were first sworn to the truth of their respective <lb/>
            statements.2 The defendant, being called upon for his defence, either <lb/>
            simply denied the plaintiff's charge, or pleaded specially. The plea, <lb/>
            like the plaint, was always in writing.</p>
          <p>A simple traverse of the charges in the plaint, a plea of the general <lb/>
            issue, as we should say, was called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀντιγραΦή</foreign>.3We have the form <lb/>
            of one in the action above referred to, (ante, p. 376,) of Apollodorus <lb/>
            against Stephanus, for false testimony: <note type="footnote"> (1) This hearing was called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνάκρισις</foreign>, because the magistrate questioned and <lb/>
            examined the parties. He was said <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνακρίνειν δίκην</foreign>, the parties <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνακρίνεσθαι</foreign>, the <lb/>
            cause itself <foreign xml:lang="grc">άνακριθη̃ναι</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) These oaths were called <foreign xml:lang="grc">άντωμοσία</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">διωμοσία</foreign>. The former originally sig­ <lb/>
            nified only the defendant's oath; then it was used as synonymous with the plea or <lb/>
            answer (<foreign xml:lang="grc">άντιγραΦὴ</foreign>) in support of which it was sworn: afterwards it was applied also <lb/>
            to the plaintiff's oath and his pleading. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Διωμοσία</foreign> was used of the plaintiff's or the <lb/>
            defendant's oath, or of both together. See Meier and Schömann, Att. Proc. 624, 628. </note><note type="footnote"> (3) The claim put in by each of the parties to an Inheritance cause, in which no <lb/>

          <p>" Stephanus son of Menecles of 'charae says that his testimony, <lb/>
            to wit that which is written in the deposition, was true."</p>
          <p>A special plea was called <foreign xml:lang="grc">παραγραΦή</foreign>. This, instead of meeting <lb/>
            the plaintiff's charge by a denial, set up an objection, either of law <lb/>
            or fact, to the maintenance of the action. With us the term special <lb/>
            plea is applied only, where the defendant alleges matter of fact as an <lb/>
            answer to the action: an objection of law, arising upon the plaintiff's <lb/>
            own statement of his case, is called a demurrer. No such distinction <lb/>
            prevailed at Athens. The term <foreign xml:lang="grc">παραγραΦὴ</foreign> was applied to every <lb/>
            objection raised by pleading, whether it was patent on the face of the <lb/>
            proceedings or not. We have several examples of these pleas in the <lb/>
            orations of Demosthenes.</p>
          <p>To an action brought by Nausimachus and Xenopithes against <lb/>
            clients of Demosthenes the plea is, that a release of the cause of <lb/>
            action had formerly been given to their father.</p>
          <p>Phormio, sued by Apollodorus for a bank deposit, pleads a release, <lb/>
            and also the statute of limitations, that is, that the cause of action <lb/>
            had accrued more than five years ago, which was a bar to all actions <lb/>
            for the recovery of debts.</p>
          <p>Nicobulus, sued by Pantænetus, pleads 1. a release; 2. that several <lb/>
            causes of action, belonging to different jurisdictions, had been joined <lb/>
            in one plaint; 3. that the plaintiff had brought a mining action, which <lb/>
            the circumstances did not justify.</p>
          <p>A plea similar to the last is pleaded by Demon at the suit of <lb/>
            Zenothemis, viz. that he had brought a mercantile action improperly, <lb/>
            without having any contract which could legally be the subject of <lb/>
            such an action. And this, says he, appears by the plaintiff's own <lb/>
            declaration.1</p>
          <p>The mode of trying these objections was peculiar. With us issues <lb/>
            of law are determined by the court separately from issues of fact: <lb/>
            but all issues of fact are sent together to be decided by the jury, <lb/>
            each party having to prove those, the affirmative of which lies upon <lb/>
            him. The Athenian paragraphe, whether it raised questions of fact <lb/>
            or law or both, was always tried by itself, separately from the <lb/>
            general issue. It was treated as a distinct case, or a distinct action, <lb/>
            m which the defendant assumed the character of plaintiff; he began, <lb/>
            and all the burden of proof lay upon him.2 If he failed to establish <lb/>
            his objection, the original action was proceeded with: if he established <lb/>
            it, there was an end of the original action, unless it was an objection <lb/>
            in point of form only, in which case the action might be recom­ <lb/>
            menced in the proper manner.</p>
          <p>To make this clear: let us suppose that accord and satisfaction is <lb/>
            pleaded to an action of debt. In England, if there were also a plea <note type="footnote"> (1) <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ αὐτὸςὸμολογει̃ ἐν τψ̃ ἐγκλήματι</foreign>. Demosthenes, cont.Zenoth. 882. Compare <lb/>

            traversing the debt, both would be tried together: the plaintiff <lb/>
            would first have to prove the existence of the debt, and then the <lb/>
            defendant would be called upon to prove accord and satisfaction. <lb/>
            At Athens there would be a distinct trial of the issue raised by the <lb/>
            special plea. If the defendant could show, that the matter had been <lb/>
            settled by agreement as he alleged, he defeated the action altogether: <lb/>
            if he failed to make this out, another trial was appointed for proof <lb/>
            of the plaintiff's case.</p>
          <p>It is obvious that the Athenian practice was attended with incon­ <lb/>
            venience and delay; and we know that special pleas were frequently <lb/>
            resorted to for the purpose of harassing the plaintiff and throwing <lb/>
            difficulties in his way. Demosthenes, who knew how to employ them <lb/>
            for his clients when it suited his purpose, classes them with affidavits <lb/>
            to postpone the trial and other dilatory devices: (ante, p. 93.) <lb/>
            They were therefore regarded with disfavour by juries; especially <lb/>
            pleas to the jurisdiction, and objections of a mere technical cha­ <lb/>
            racter : and hence we find that in the extant speeches in support of <lb/>
            such pleadings the defendants, instead of confining themselves to the <lb/>
            issues before the court, travel out of the record to show that the <lb/>
            general merits are on their side, and that there never was any <lb/>
            foundation for the plaintiff's action.1 This of course was irregular: <lb/>
            yet the opening of the whole case might occasionally produce a good <lb/>
            effect: it might enable the parties to guess the probable result of <lb/>
            a second trial, and so stop further litigation.</p>
          <p>The regulation by which special pleas were thus separately tried, <lb/>
            and the defendant got the advantage of beginning, was first intro­ <lb/>
            duced after the expulsion of the Thirty Tyrants. Its chief object <lb/>
            was to enable persons, who might be prosecuted for political offences, <lb/>
            to plead with more effect the general amnesty which had been agreed <lb/>
            to: but the principle was extended to all special defences, and to <lb/>
            private as well as public causes. This is explained in the opening <lb/>
            of the speech of Isocrates against Callimachus, which the student <lb/>
            should perused</p>
          <p>There was another course, besides this of special pleading, by <lb/>
            which a defendant might impede the progress of an action. He <lb/>
            might get a witness to make an affidavit, showing that for some <lb/>
            reason or other the action was not maintainable: the affidavit was <lb/>
            called <foreign xml:lang="grc">διαμαρτυρία</foreign>. The plaintiff then could not proceed with the <lb/>
            cause, until he had convicted the witness of perjury: if he declined <lb/>
            to proceed against the witness, or' if he failed to convict him, the <lb/>
            cause was lost. This proceeding was most common upon claims to <note type="footnote"> (1) See the arguments to the Orations cent. Zenothemim and pro Phormione. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) Before this time the term <foreign xml:lang="grc">παραγραΦὴ</foreign> was not used, but every plea was caned <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀντιγραΦή</foreign>. If a special defence was pleaded, it came on to be tried as part of the <lb/>
            cause. We have an example in the speech of Lysias against Pancleon. See p. 166. <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπειδὴ δέ μοι άντεγράψατο μὴ εἰσαγώγιμον εἰναι</foreign>. The term <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξωμοσία</foreign> was also <lb/>
            applied to a special plea, because it was confirmed by oath. See Meier and Schömann, <lb/>
            Att. Proc. 633, 644. </note> <lb/>

            inheritances; and there were certain known grounds, upon which it <lb/>
            could legally be founded; as, that the last owner of the estate had <lb/>
            left a son and heir, which excluded the title of a collateral relative; <lb/>
            or that the estate had already been adjudged by law, and the question <lb/>
            could not be litigated again. The affidavit was usually made by a wit­ <lb/>
            ness : but from examples which we find in Isæus and Demosthenes <lb/>
            it appears, that it could be made by the party himself, who then <lb/>
            incurred the liability of an ordinary witness to be sued for false <lb/>
            testimony. He deposited in the first instance a tenth part of the <lb/>
            value of the estate, which, if the affidavit were pronounced to be <lb/>
            false, was forfeited to the adversary.</p>
          <p>But the right to put in an affidavit of this sort was not given to <lb/>
            the defendant only. The plaintiff was at liberty to tender one on <lb/>
            his own behalf, alleging that the action was maintainable. And it <lb/>
            seems, the plaintiff's right took priority of the defendant's; that is, <lb/>
            he had the first choice of putting in such an affidavit. Upon his <lb/>
            doing so, the defendant, if he wished to stop the action, was com­ <lb/>
            pelled to sue the plaintiff's witness: if he failed to sue the witness <lb/>
            or to convict him, the cause was carried to trial. By the conviction <lb/>
            of the plaintiff's witness the cause was defeated; and, if on the trial <lb/>
            of his witness the plaintiff did not get a fifth of the votes, he had to <lb/>
            pay a sixth part of the damages to the defendant.2</p>
          <p>If the defendant simply denied the plaintiff's charge, without <lb/>
            making any special objections, the magistrate had to prepare the <lb/>
            cause for trial. In describing the subsequent proceedings I shall <lb/>
            suppose this course to have been adopted.3 I shall suppose also, <lb/>
            that the parties chose to have the case tried by a jury, and not by an <lb/>
            arbitrator. How and under what conditions the last course was open <lb/>
            to them, will be shown in the following Appendix.</p>
          <p>The business now was to receive the evidence, and to put it into <lb/>
            the proper shape to be produced at the trial. No evidence was <lb/>
            admissible in court, that was not in writing.</p>
          <p>The proofs would lie partly in the law and partly in the facts of <lb/>
            the case. The unwritten or common law needed no proof: the <lb/>
            parties appealed to that general knowledge of it which the magis­ <lb/>
            trate and the jury possessed, or were supposed to possess. Statutory <lb/>
            law was proved, not, as with us, by producing an authentic copy of <lb/>
            the whole statute-(the Athenians had no multiplied copies of their <lb/>
            written code, much less any authenticated ones like those in England <lb/>
            which are printed by the king's printer )-but by producing such <lb/>
            extracts as were material to the issues in the cause. The whole of <note type="footnote"> (1) Isæus, De Pyrrhi hereditate, de Philoctemonis hereditate. Demosthenes, <lb/>

              the Athenian code was kept in the temple of Cybele under the <lb/>
              custody of a public officer; and every Athenian had access to it. <lb/>
              Parts of the law were to be found in other places; for instance, <lb/>
              laws which concerned the duties of the Archon were hung up in his <lb/>
              office; those which concerned the Council, in the council-chamber; <lb/>
              and so on. Whatever extracts were taken by either party to be used <lb/>
              in the cause, were brought to the superintending magistrate, whose <lb/>
              duty we may presume it was to see that they were genuine. To <lb/>
              cite a fictitious law before the jury was an offence punishable with <lb/>
              death.1</p>
          <p>Extracts were in like manner taken from popular decrees, orders <lb/>
            of council, state papers, or any other documents that were kept in <lb/>
            the public archives and were accessible to all.</p>
          <p>The.. testimonial evidence on either side was reduced to. the shape <lb/>
            of depositions. This was frequently done by the parties at their <lb/>
            own houses: but it was as frequently done upon the examination <lb/>
            before the magistrate by the clerk in attendance. The common. <lb/>
            practice was for the witnesses to attend at the magistrate's office, <lb/>
            and to be sworn at the altar; though that was not absolutely neces­ <lb/>
            sary. When the witnesses did not attend, their depositions were <lb/>
            produced to the magistrate by the parties who intended to use them; <lb/>
            but neither these nor any other depositions could be read at the trial, <lb/>
            unless the witnesses were present to confirm them. To this the only <lb/>
            exception was, where the witness was abroad or unable to attend <lb/>
            from illness, in which case his deposition might be certified by the <lb/>
            oath of one or more persons appointed to receive it.2 Women, <lb/>
            minors, and disfranchised citizens were not competent witnesses: <lb/>
            neither could the parties give direct testimony for themselves; but <lb/>
            each might question the other, and have his answer taken down, to <lb/>
            be given in evidence against him. Slaves could only be examined <lb/>
            under the torture, as will be shown presently. Hearsay evidence <lb/>
            was inadmissible, except the declarations of deceased persons; a <lb/>
            rule resembling that of our own country.</p>
          <p>Many forms of depositions are to be found in the orators. We <lb/>
            have had some examples in the speech against Midias: (ante, pp. <lb/>
            96,101,122.) The following is one from the speech of Demosthenes <lb/>
            against Lacntus: (p. 927.)</p>
          <p>"Archenomides son of Archedamas of Anagyrus testifies, that <lb/>

            of Phaselus, and that the agreement is still in his hands."</p>

            were handed in to the magistrate, certified by the depositions of <lb/>
            witnesses, which were annexed to them. If any document required <lb/>
            as evidence by either party were in the hands of the opponent, he <lb/>
            might challenge or give him notice to produce it. In case of <lb/>
            refusal, it seems he might take a legal proceeding to compel pro­ <lb/>
            duction ; 1 but the more usual course was, to give evidence of his <lb/>
            own challenge, in order to raise a presumption or prejudice against <lb/>
            the opponent.</p>
          <p>Challenges, <foreign xml:lang="grc">προκλήσεις</foreign>, which one party gave to another during <lb/>
            the progress of a cause, were of various kinds. Thus, one party <lb/>
            challenged the other to produce a document and allow him to take <lb/>
            a copy of it. Or he challenged the other to inspect a document in <lb/>
            his own possession, which he intended to put in evidence; giving <lb/>
            him an opportunity to see that it was genuine, in order to prevent <lb/>
            him from disputing it afterwards. With the like object he might <lb/>
            propose to send out a joint commission of inquiry, to obtain evidence <lb/>
            of something which had happened at a distance from home, and <lb/>
            which could not well be ascertained without going to the spot.3 Or <lb/>
            he proposed to refer some particular question to a person who was <lb/>
            capable of deciding it, or even to stake the whole cause upon such <lb/>
            person's testimony. The most common of all challenges were pro­ <lb/>
            posals for giving up slaves to be examined by torture.4</p>
          <p>We have seen that slaves were incompetent to give testimony, <lb/>
            except under that cruel application which not only the ancient Greeks <lb/>
            and Romans, but even Christians for many ages persisted in regarding <lb/>
            as a test of the truth. The Athenian orators went so far as to assert, <lb/>
            that the evidence thus elicited from slaves was more to be relied upon <lb/>
            than the testimony of freemen. The law however was, that no man <lb/>
            could examine a slave without the adversary's consent. If either <lb/>
            party desired the evidence of a slave, either his own or his opponent's, <lb/>
            he made a formal challenge, proposing that the slave should be <lb/>
            questioned, and specifying the terms, naming the person by whom <lb/>
            torture should be applied and compensation awarded for the corporal <lb/>
            injury.5 If the challenge was accepted, the examination took place <note type="footnote"> (1) By a <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίκη εἰς ἐμΦανω̃ν κατάστασιν</foreign>.

              as agreed upon: the slave was placed on the wheel or rack, and <lb/>
              under the pressure of so much torture as the examiners were <lb/>
              authorized to administer answered the interrogatories put to him: <lb/>
              his answers were written down, and afterwards produced in evidence, <lb/>
              verified either by the examiners themselves, or by any other witness <lb/>
              who was present.</p>
          <p>The challenge might be given and accepted before the superintend­ <lb/>
            ing magistrate, and the examination of the slave might be conducted <lb/>
            in his office by a public servant; and we read even of a proposal to <lb/>
            question a slave before the jury.1 It was more usual however for <lb/>
            the examination to take place in private. The challenges were most <lb/>
            frequently given in the market-place, in the presence of several <lb/>
            witnesses.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding what the orators assert as to the value of evidence <lb/>
            obtained by torture, we gather from their writings, that the offers of <lb/>
            the litigant parties, either to give up their own slaves for examination, <lb/>
            or to examine those of their adversaries, were generally refused, <lb/>
            (whether out of fear or out of humanity, it is difficult to say,) and <lb/>
            that the object of the proposal was, to obtain a refusal and make it <lb/>
            a matter of observation to the jury.2 Thus, if the plaintiff refused <lb/>
            to give up his slave, the defendant put the challenge in evidence, and <lb/>
            argued upon it as follows:</p>
          <p>"You see, the plaintiff dared not let me examine his slave. He <lb/>
            could have given us all the information we desire; he knew all about <lb/>
            the transaction; he knew a great deal too much for his master. <lb/>
            Therefore he declined to give him up."</p>
          <p>If the plaintiff refused to examine a slave offered him by the <lb/>
            defendant, his comments upon the refusal were much to the same <lb/>
            effect:</p>
          <p>"You see, I offered to give up my slave to the question. He <lb/>
            could have told you all about the affair. Notwithstanding the <lb/>
            advantage of having him under torture, the plaintiff dared not <lb/>
            examine him, for fear of his telling the truth."</p>
          <p>A challenge of a peculiar kind, but by no means unfrequent, was <lb/>
            the proposal to decide the controversy either wholly or partially, by <lb/>
            a solemn oath, to be sworn either by the challenger himself, or by Iris <figure type="illustration">

               <pb n="384"/>
              opponent, or by some third person.1 Even a woman, who was not <lb/>
              competent to give testimony, could take an oath of this kind; for it <lb/>
              could not be taken at all without consent of both parties.</p>
          <p>Such offers were to the following effect :-" If you will admit my <lb/>
            oath as proof, I offer to swear that I paid the money." Or—" If you <lb/>
            will swear that you paid three talents, I will give up the caused <lb/>
            Or-,, If your mother will swear she had a marriage portion of thirty <lb/>
            minas, I give up the point," or " I forego my claim to that extent."</p>
          <p>Offers of the first Kind appear to have been rarely accepted: for <lb/>
            it is manifest, they put the acceptor at the mercy of his adversary, <lb/>
            with no other safeguard than his respect for the sanctity of an oath. <lb/>
            And there was the like danger in making an offer of the second kind. <lb/>
            It was done however occasionally, from some such motive as the <lb/>
            following--either because the challenger had a high opinion of him <lb/>
            to whom the oath was tendered; or because he had reason to believe <lb/>
            the oath would not be taken; or because he had no means of proving <lb/>
            his own case and took a desperate chance. Against the risk he might <lb/>
            set off the advantage to be gained by a refusal: for, when a man <lb/>
            declines to maintain by his own oath a fact which he is ready to prove <lb/>
            by other means, a prejudice is raised against him-perhaps unjustly; <lb/>
            for he may not know the fact of his own knowledge; but this equally <lb/>
            serves the purpose of the adversary.</p>
          <p>When a man refused to allow his opponent to swear an oath, it <lb/>
            was good policy to offer to swear one himself: for then the arguments <lb/>
            on either side, that arose out of the refusal, neutralized one another. <lb/>
            I shall cite two cases from Demosthenes, to illustrate this Athenian <lb/>
            practice.</p>
          <p>Apollodorus, in an action against Timotheus, thus states his reason <lb/>
            for refusing the defendant's oath:</p>
          <p>" I have a word to say about the challenges to oaths; that which <lb/>
            I gave the defendant, and that which he gave to me. For, when I <lb/>
            had put an oath2 into the box, he too proposed to take one and <lb/>
            discharge himself. If I had not been well aware, how many solemn <lb/>
            oaths he had sworn (to states and individuals) and perjured himself, <lb/>
            I should have allowed him to take this oath. But when I can prove <lb/>
            by witnesses and strong circumstantial evidence, that his nominees <lb/>
            received the money from the bank, I think it would be folly to allow <lb/>
            him to swear."</p>
          <p>Mantitheus, another client of Demosthenes, in one of the causes <lb/>
            between himself and Bœotus, tells the following story:3—</p>
          <p>"Mantias, father of the speaker, had a mistress named Plangon. She <lb/>
            had two sons, who were not sure by whom they ought to be fathered. <lb/>
            They maintained they were the sons of Mantias, but this Mantias denied, <note type="footnote"> (1) Att. Proc. 686. Hudtwalcker, 53. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) I. e. the form of the oath which I proposed, but was not permitted, to swear, <lb/>
            and of the refusal of which I intended to give evidence at the trial. See Demosthenes, <lb/>
            cont. Timotheum, 1203. </note><note type="footnote"> L (3) Demosthenes, cont. Bœotum de nomine, 995. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="385"/>
            and would not allow them to live with him. Bœotus, the elder of <lb/>
            them, when he came to man's estate, commenced a suit, to compel <lb/>
            him to acknowledge them. Pending this, the mother comes to <lb/>
            Mantias, and advises him to propose, that she should swear the <lb/>
            children were his; telling him she would refuse to swear it, and <lb/>
            giving a solemn promise to that effect. He, deceived by her promise, <lb/>
            puts in a challenge before the arbitrator, whereby he tenders the said <lb/>
            oath to the mother. Bœotus accepts the challenge.. Plangon breaks <lb/>
            her promise, and takes the oath. Mantias cannot recede from his <lb/>
            own terms, according to which the proof is conclusive against him. <lb/>
            He therefore acquiesces, declares the children to be his own, in­ <lb/>
            troduces them to his clansmen, and enters their names in the <lb/>
            register."</p>
          <p>That an oath, which had such decisive effects, should be one of <lb/>
            more than usual solemnity, was to be expected. The party swearing, <lb/>
            if he had children, made them stand before him, and imprecated <lb/>
            a curse upon their heads; or, if he had no children, he imprecated <lb/>
            dreadful curses upon himself and his whole race; adding force to his <lb/>
            words by touching full-grown victims.</p>
          <p>To distinguish this from the ordinary oath by which a witness con­ <lb/>
            firmed his testimony, we may call it an evidentiary oath. It is to <lb/>
            this which Aristotle alludes, when he speaks of oaths as a kind of <lb/>
            proof.1</p>
          <p>The evidentiary oath of the Athenians may be compared to our old <lb/>
            Saxon mode of trial by wager of law (which was abolished in the <lb/>
            reign of William IV.); whereby a defendant, in an action of debt or <lb/>
            detmue, was allowed to acquit himself of the charge by swearing <lb/>
            that he did not owe the debt, or did not detain the goods, and pro­ <lb/>
            ducing eleven, other persons, his neighbours, who swore that they <lb/>
            believed him. These eleven persons were called compurgators. The <lb/>
            origin of the custom seems to have been this; that in ancient times <lb/>
            there was a difficulty in procuring evidence, most things being trans- <lb/>
            acted between the parties in private; and the credit of a man <lb/>
            depended very much on the opinion which his neighbours entertained <lb/>
            of him; and the law presumed, that no man would perjure himself <lb/>
            for any worldly advantage. Blackstone thus speaks of it in the third <lb/>
            volume of his Commentaries, page 342.</p>
          <p>" Trial by wager of law is not only to be found in the codes of <lb/>
            almost all the northern nations, that broke in upon the Roman empire, <lb/>
            and established petty kingdoms upon its ruins, but its original may <lb/>
            be traced as far back as the Mosaic law :-' If a man deliver unto his <lb/>
            neighbour an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast to keep ; and it <lb/>
            die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man seeing it; then shall an oath <lb/>
            of the Lord be between them both, that he hath not put his hand <lb/>
            unto his neighbour's goods ; and the owner of it shall accept thereof, <note type="footnote"> (1) He reckons them among the <foreign xml:lang="grc">α̋τεχνοι πίστεις</foreign>.<unclear/>| Rhetor, i. 14. See his reasoning <lb/>
            upon them, section 27, &amp;c. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. III. </note> <note type="footnote"> CO </note> <lb/>

            and he shall not make it-good. ' We shall likewise be able to discern <lb/>
            a manifest resemblance between this species of trial, and the canonical <lb/>
            purgation of the popish clergy when accused of any capital crime. <lb/>
            The defendant or person accused was in both cases to make oath of <lb/>
            his own innocence, and to produce a certain number of compurgators <lb/>
            who swore they believed his oath. Somewhat similar also to this is <lb/>
            the sacramentum decisionis, or the voluntary and decisive oath of the <lb/>
            civil law; where one of the parties to the suit, not being able to <lb/>
            prove his charge, offers to refer the decision of the cause to the oath <lb/>
            of his adversary; which the adversary was bound to accept, or tender <lb/>
            the same proposal back again; otherwise the whole was taken as <lb/>
            confessed by him."</p>
          <p>All challenges, of whatever kind, were made in writing, and, if <lb/>
            accepted, were reduced to the form of a contract. If refused, they <lb/>
            were put in as evidence together with the certifying depositions. Nor <lb/>
            were they made only during the pendency of an action. It was often <lb/>
            desirable, with a view to the bringing of an action, or for fear of one <lb/>
            being brought by an adversary, to take some step by way of precau­ <lb/>
            tion, such as demanding inspection of a document for the purpose of <lb/>
            securing evidence beforehand. Or a challenge might be made with a <lb/>
            view to settle some dispute and prevent litigation.</p>
          <p>When all these preliminaries had been gone through-when the <lb/>
            parties had examined their witnesses, taken the answers of slaves, <lb/>
            made their challenges, got ready their documentary proofs-in short, <lb/>
            when all the evidence had been produced, and the whole of each <lb/>
            party's case laid fully before the magistrate-the instructio litis was <lb/>
            brought to a close. Meanwhile the hearing at his office might be <lb/>
            adjourned from day to day for the accommodation of the parties, to <lb/>
            enable them to adduce or prepare fresh evidence, to inquire into the <lb/>
            law, to search the public archives, to consult their friends and <lb/>
            advisers. During the progress of the examination, as the case <lb/>
            gradually unfolded itself to the magistrate, he had an opportunity <lb/>
            of forming a judgment as to its merits and as to its probable <lb/>
            result.</p>
          <p>What I have already said respecting his judicial power, will apply in <lb/>
            a great measure to this stage of the proceedings also. Though with­ <lb/>
            out power to decide, we cannot doubt, that it was both his duty and <lb/>
            his practice so far to carry and so to conduct the inquiry, as to satisfy <lb/>
            his own mind, and make it in. some degree appear to the parties <lb/>
            themselves, on which side lay the justice of the case. The mere <lb/>
            intimation of his opinion might have a useful effect, by leading to a <lb/>
            compromise,1 or inducing one of the parties to give in. If both were <lb/>
            determined to go on, he proceeded to prepare the cause for trial. All <lb/>
            the depositions and answers, challenges, documents, extracts from <lb/>
            laws and decrees, &amp;c., were carefully collected together and put into <note type="footnote"> (1) As to compromises of the cause in general, see Meier and Schömann, Att. Proc. <lb/>
            700. </note> <lb/>

            a box,1 which the magistrate sealed and kept safe in his office until <lb/>
            the court day. After the sealing of the box no further evidence <lb/>
            could strictly be put in, and no evidence could be offered to the jury, <lb/>
            which had not been produced before the magistrate. The rule was <lb/>
            occasionally relaxed: its object however was a good one, to prevent <lb/>
            surprised</p>
          <p>The trial commonly took place about the thirtieth day after the <lb/>
            commencement of the action; but this would vary according to cir­ <lb/>
            cumstances. Mercantile, mining, and club causes were by law <lb/>
            required to be decided within the space of a month: but to others <lb/>
            there was no such limit prescribed.3 The time occupied in the <lb/>
            instructio litis depended on the nature and importance of the cause, <lb/>
            the number of witnesses, &amp;c. It might be purposely spun out <lb/>
            under various pretences. The trial again might be postponed, either <lb/>
            at the request of one of the parties, or by agreement between them, <lb/>
            or owing to the state of public business. It would appear from the <lb/>
            Oration against Midias (ante, pp. 92, 93, 95) that the delays and tricks <lb/>
            of the law were as much a subject of complaint at Athens as <lb/>
            elsewhere.</p>
          <p>When the day of trial was fixed, notice was given to both parties. <lb/>
            It was the business of the Thesmothetæ to publish a list of causes, <lb/>
            and to assign to each court a sufficient number of jurors, drawn by <lb/>
            lot from the whole of the Heliastic body. The parties summoned <lb/>
            their respective witnesses, and, if they failed to attend, had a right <lb/>
            of action against them. The summons or notice had the same effect <lb/>
            as the subpoena has with us.4</p>
          <p>On the appointed day the magistrate took his place as president of <lb/>
            the court, and had the assistance of the city police5 to keep order. <lb/>
            The jury were impanelled and sworn.6 When all was ready, the <lb/>
            cause was called on. The parties could not appear by counsel, as <lb/>
            with us: but personal attendance was necessary. If the plaintiff was <lb/>
            not there, he was nonsuited. If the defendant did not appear, <lb/>
            judgment was given against him by default, contrary to our practice, <lb/>
            which compels the plamtiff to prove his case, whether the defendant <lb/>
            appears in court or not. Judgment however was not given, if it <lb/>
            could be shown that the plaintiff or the defendant was prevented from <lb/>
            attending by some good cause, such as illness, the death of a near <lb/>
            relative, or absence on the public service. This was to be shown by <lb/>
            an affidavit7 of the absent party, produced by some person duly <lb/>
            authorized, who on behalf of his friend applied to have the trial put <lb/>
            off. The other party might oppose the application, and produce (if <note type="footnote"> (1) Called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐχι̃νος</foreign>.

            he pleased a counter affidavit.1 The jury decided whether the <lb/>
            excuse could be received.2</p>
          <p>Both parties being present, the proceedings commenced by the <lb/>
            clerk of the court reading the record: 3 after which each party <lb/>
            addressed the jury; first the plaintiff, and then the defendant. By <lb/>
            the ancient practice they were obliged not only to attend in person, <lb/>
            but to plead their own cause. This rule was afterwards relaxed, and <lb/>
            either party by permission of the court might procure a friend to <lb/>
            plead for him : leave was always granted in case of illness, or when <lb/>
            from any mental infirmity a man was unable to conduct his own case <lb/>
            without manifest disadvantage. Thus, when Isocrates was ill, his <lb/>
            son Aphareus spoke for him in the cause about the Exchange. And <lb/>
            the speech of Demosthenes against Leochares was delivered by a <lb/>
            son for his father. As the jury liked to see and to hear the party <lb/>
            himself, the most usual course, if he needed the assistance of an <lb/>
            advocate, was to open his case in a brief address, and leave his <lb/>
            friend to finish it. Many who were inexperienced in forensic practice, <lb/>
            and who could afford to pay for it, got their speeches written, and <lb/>
            indeed their whole cases prepared for them, by the professed speech- <lb/>
            writers, a class of men who sprang up not long after the establishment <lb/>
            of the jury system. Among these Antiphon was the first who <lb/>
            became famous; after him came Lysias, Isseus, Isocrates, Demosthenes, <lb/>
            Dinarchus. Most of the private speeches of Demosthenes, all of <lb/>
            Isæus, and all of Lysias but one, were composed for clients.</p>
          <p>The plaintiff and the defendant each addressed the court either <lb/>
            once or twice; the defendant always having the last word. Whether <lb/>
            they spoke once or twice, perhaps depended on the nature of the <lb/>
            case; or it might be a mere question of arrangement for the day; or <lb/>
            it might be optional with the parties themselves. Two short speeches <lb/>
            would take up no more time than one long speech. The time, as we <lb/>
            have seen, was measured by the waterglass; and we have some <lb/>
            information given us about the quantity of water allowed in particular <lb/>
            actions, which however makes us very little the wiser, for everything <lb/>
            depends on the size of the tube through which the water ran. If <lb/>
            either party got a friend to follow him, he gave up so much of his <lb/>
            own time to the speech of the advocate, so that the whole of the <figure type="illustration">

              time occupied in speaking was precisely the same, whatever number <lb/>
              of persons spoke on each side.1</p>
          <p>The evidence of each party was produced during the course of his <lb/>
            address to the jury, the rule being that every assertion either of fact <lb/>
            or law, which required proof, was to be proved at the time it was <lb/>
            made. Thus, if the plaintiff stated that there was an agreement in <lb/>
            writing, he was bound as soon as possible, at least after finishing his <lb/>
            comment or argument, to put in the agreement itself, together with <lb/>
            the deposition in support of it. In like manner the statutes or <lb/>
            statutory clauses, by which a point of law was established, were <lb/>
            produced while it was fresh in the minds of the jury. All these <lb/>
            proofs were read aloud by the clerk of the court, and in the meantime <lb/>
            the waterglass was stopped. No deposition however could be read, <lb/>
            unless the deponent himself attended to confirm it. The witnesses <lb/>
            were brought up to the platform of the speaker, and, after their <lb/>
            depositions had been read, they gave their assent either viva voce, <lb/>
            by saying " that is my evidence" or the like, or, by simply nodding <lb/>
            their heads. Sometimes they were sworn in court; but this was not <lb/>
            necessary for the affirmance of a deposition; and when they took an <lb/>
            oath, the object probably was to obtain greater credit with the jury. <lb/>
            If a witness who had received due notice failed to attend, he was <lb/>
            solemnly called by an officer of the court,2 and a fine of a thousand <lb/>
            drachms was imposed on him: besides which, he was liable to an <lb/>
            action at the suit of the party injured.3 When a hostile witness was <lb/>
            called, his deposition (containing such evidence as the party preparing <lb/>
            it supposed him able to give) was read over by the clerk, and he was <lb/>
            required to depose to it, or take an oath of disclaimer, that is, to <lb/>
            swear that he knew nothing about the matter, or was unable to give <lb/>
            the testimony prepared for him. If he would do neither, he was <lb/>
            fined a thousand drachms for his contumacy. An example or two <lb/>
            will show how a hostile witness might be dealt with. I take the first <lb/>
            from Isæus.5 The speaker, intending to call a person in the interest <lb/>
            of his opponent, says:</p>
          <p>"I know he will be unwilling to give evidence contrary to the will <lb/>
            which he produces. However call Hierocles, that in the presence of <lb/>
            the jury he may either depose or take the oath of disclaimer. <lb/>
            [Hierocles takes the oath of disclaimer.] I knew he would. The <lb/>
            same person, who will testify to facts which never took place, will <lb/>
            swear to ignorance of what he knows."</p>

            to contemn the Gods, to disregard the laws, to have no sense of <lb/>
            shame. Call me Hegesander. [The deposition is read, and Hegesander <lb/>
            takes the oath of disclaimer.] I knew he would disregard his oath, <lb/>
            men of Athens: I told you he would. And I am pretty sure that, <lb/>
            as he does not choose now to give evidence, he will come forward <lb/>
            presently for the defence."</p>
          <p>Cross-examination of the witnesses in court was not allowed. It <lb/>
            was incompatible indeed with the production of written evidence, <lb/>
            and with the whole scheme of arrangements, which were so contrived <lb/>
            as to compress the trial into the shortest possible compass. Questions <lb/>
            might be put by each party to the other, but only by the party who <lb/>
            was addressing the court; for neither was permitted to interrupt the <lb/>
            speech of his opponent. The jury however might at any time stop <lb/>
            the speaker, and interrogate him, or ask for explanations, on matter <lb/>
            of fact or law. The 'parties often requested them to exercise this <lb/>
            right, and suggested the questions to be asked.1</p>
          <p>The speeches on both sides being concluded, the magistrate called <lb/>
            upon the jury to find their verdict. They voted by ballot as in <lb/>
            criminal cases, using either stones, shells, beans, or balls of metal. <lb/>
            The most common method of taking the ballot was the secret one, <lb/>
            and was as follows. Each juror had two balls given him, a black and <lb/>
            a white, or a pierced and an unpierced one. The black or pierced was <lb/>
            for the plaintiff, the white or unpierced for the defendant. There <lb/>
            were also two boxes;2 one of brass, called the judgment box, into <lb/>
            which the juror dropped that ball which he meant to vote with; the <lb/>
            other a wooden box, into which he dropped the other ball, and was <lb/>
            thus enabled to conceal his vote.</p>
          <p>Another method was, to provide only one box, in which case the <lb/>
            juror returned the ball which he did not use to the officer of the <lb/>
            court. A third method was, to have two boxes, a plaintiff's and a <lb/>
            defendant's box, and to furnish the juror with only one ball, which <lb/>
            he put into the box of that party for whom he voted.</p>
          <p>In inheritance causes, and some others, where there were more <lb/>
            than two parties before the court, a ballot box was provided for each <lb/>
            party, into which those jurors who meant to vote in his favour put <lb/>
            their balls.3</p>
          <p>The votes were counted by the officer of the court, and the result <lb/>
            was declared by the magistrate. If there was a verdict for the plaintiff, <note type="footnote"> (1) See Meier and Schömann, Att. Proc. 717, 718. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) These were called <foreign xml:lang="grc">κάδοι, καδισκοι</foreign>, or <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀμφορε</foreign>ĩ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ς</foreign>.

            and damages had to be assessed, the course was pretty much the <lb/>
            same as that upon a criminal trial, where sentence had to be passed <lb/>
            by the jury; which having been already explained, I need not <lb/>
            repeat it here.</p>
          <p>If the plaintiff did not get a fifth part of the votes, he was <lb/>
            condemned to pay a sixth of the damages, 1 as a penalty for his false <lb/>
            claim, to the defendant. Some writers have adopted the statement <lb/>
            of Pollux, that both plaintiff and defendant were liable to this <lb/>
            penalty; but it is highly improbable that a defendant should have to <lb/>
            pay a sixth part of the damages twice over. That he should be <lb/>
            mulcted thus in a cross action, or upon the trial of a special plea, <lb/>
            which was in the nature of a cross action, is a different affair. We <lb/>
            require better authority than that of Pollux to believe the other <lb/>
            proposition.2</p>
          <p>I have next to speak of execution.</p>
          <p>The judgment in a civil action, so far as it concerned the party, <lb/>
            was left solely for him to execute. If he had recovered a specific <lb/>
            chattel or a piece of land, he might himself take possession, by <lb/>
            seizure of the one, by entry upon the other. If damages had been <lb/>
            awarded, he was to levy them, either upon the goods of the <lb/>
            defendant, or (if there were no goods) by seizure of his real property. <lb/>
            In all this neither the superintending magistrate, nor any person like <lb/>
            our sheriff or bailiff, was at hand to enforce the law. The court gave <lb/>
            him his judgment, but lent him no further aid, except in some special <lb/>
            cases, when a defendant was ordered to be imprisoned until payment <lb/>
            of the debt.3</p>
          <p>A day was given to the losing party to perform the order of the <lb/>
            court, that is, to pay the damages, or surrender the property recovered <lb/>
            from him.4 - What time was allowed for this purpose, we are not <lb/>
            informed. If the judgment was not satisfied by the appointed day, <lb/>
            the party who obtained it might proceed forthwith to execution.</p>
          <p>Thus armed with the authority of the law, he seized on the pro­ <lb/>
            perty of his opponent, and this he retained or sold (as the case might <lb/>
            be), unless it was redeemed by the owner within a reasonable time. If <lb/>
            the value of the property seized exceeded the damages, the proper <lb/>
            course would be to sell it, and (after satisfying himself) to pay over <lb/>
            the surplus to his opponent.</p>
          <p>If any one resisted the execution, (whether it was the party <lb/>
            himself or any other person on his behalf,) he was liable to an action <lb/>
            of ejectment ; 5 in which the title to the property seized was the <note type="footnote"> (1) The <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπωβελία</foreign>, so called because it was an obol for every drachm. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) Meier and Schömann, Att.

            subject of inquiry; but, if the defendant lost the cause, he was con­ <lb/>
            demned to pay a fine equal to the damages (or to the value of the <lb/>
            property) recovered in the former action.</p>
          <p>Where lands or tenements had been recovered, the plaintiff might, <lb/>
            if he pleased, bring an action to recover the rents and profits ;1 but, <lb/>
            if the judgment in such an action remained unsatisfied, he was driven <lb/>
            at last to his remedy by execution; so that this method would be a <lb/>
            circuitous one.</p>
          <p>The successful party might, without proceeding to execution, <lb/>
            bring an action upon the judgment; 2 in which he complained, that <lb/>
            his opponent had not satisfied the judgment by paying or restoring <lb/>
            what was due to him. This would be his only course, if there were <lb/>
            no effects to levy upon. Here also, if the defendant lost the verdict, <lb/>
            the same fine was imposed on him as in the other case.</p>
          <p>By such means was the suitor who recovered a judgment enabled <lb/>
            to enforce his claim. The defendant became a state debtor. The <lb/>
            consequences of being such I have already explained. If he sought <lb/>
            to relieve himself by paying the fine, without satisfying the plaintiff, <lb/>
            he was liable to another action; and this might be repeated toties <lb/>
            quoties. Obstinacy must bend at last. Schömann thinks, that the <lb/>
            state refused to give a discharge from the fine, unless the plaintiff <lb/>
            received satisfaction. This course would certainly be less circuitous.3</p>
          <p>The difficulties which a judgment creditor often experienced in the <lb/>
            recovery of his rights, the tricks resorted to by the losing parties to <lb/>
            evade payment and restitution, by concealing their effects, making <lb/>
            fraudulent transfers, and the like, seem to have been much the same <lb/>
            at Athens as in England. A notable example is furnished by the <lb/>
            case of Demosthenes against Onetor. Such things are familiar <lb/>
            enough to those who know anything of English law. Our suitors <lb/>
            have the advantage of ministerial officers to levy their judgments, or <lb/>
            to put them in possession of their property; and the public peace is <lb/>
            by such means better secured, when the process of the law is exe­ <lb/>
            cuted by its known officers, whom no man dares to resist. But the <lb/>
            frauds practised upon creditors are in no way diminished by the <lb/>
            machinery of our law, as I could easily show.</p>
          <p>The last points here to be noticed are, the proceedings to obtain a <lb/>
            new trial or reversal of the judgment.</p>
          <p>The decisions of -an Athenian jury were (generally speaking) final. <lb/>
            There was no appellate tribunal at Athens, by which they could be <lb/>
            set aside. 4 Appeals were allowed from the public arbitrators to a <note type="footnote"> (1) ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ενοικίου δίκη</foreign>, for a house; <foreign xml:lang="grc">καρπου̃ δίκη</foreign>, for land. See those titles in the <lb/>

             <pb n="393"/>
            jury; but there was no appeal from one jury to another. The maWs­ <lb/>
            trates who presided in the different courts were not all indeed of <lb/>
            equal rank or importance ; but the courts had a coordinate jurisdic­ <lb/>
            tion, and were independent of each other; the jurors in each were <lb/>
            virtually the same body of men, representing the whole people of <lb/>
            Athens, and exercised the powers of a supreme tribunal.</p>
          <p>Although however there could be no appeal from the jury, there <lb/>
            were certain causes for which the court itself which pronounced the <lb/>
            judgment could set it aside or grant a new trial. These were not <lb/>
            indeed so various as with us. For example; a new trial was never <lb/>
            granted for errors in law, as where a statute had been misquoted or <lb/>
            misconstrued; nor for a verdict against evidence, nor for improper <lb/>
            admission or rejection of evidence, nor for any misconduct or irregu­ <lb/>
            larity on the part of the magistrate or the jury. The peculiar <lb/>
            character of the Athenian tribunal rendered it impossible to give <lb/>
            relief upon any such grounds as those.. There were, in short, two <lb/>
            cases only in which the proceedings could be set aside; first, where <lb/>
            a judgment for non-appearance had been given wrongfully; and <lb/>
            secondly, where a verdict had been obtained by false testimony.</p>
          <p>We have seen, that if either of the parties did not attend before <lb/>
            the magistrate on the hearing day, or in court on the day of trial, <lb/>
            judgment was given against him, unless some valid excuse was shown <lb/>
            for his absence. But it might happen that his absence was in­ <lb/>
            evitable, and yet there was no means of proving this at the time; or <lb/>
            that the excuse offered by his friend or agent was improperly <lb/>
            rejected; or that the opponent had prevailed against him by unfair <lb/>
            means or false representations. Again, a defendant might never <lb/>
            have been summoned, in which case the whole of the proceedings <lb/>
            would be a nullity. In any of such cases it was competent for the <lb/>
            party injured, within two months after the judgment, to apply to the <lb/>
            magistrate for a new trial; a rule for which (as we should say) was <lb/>
            granted as a matter of course in the first instance, and a day named <lb/>
            for the opponent to show cause against it. On that day the mover <lb/>
            of the rule produced an affidavit in support of it (this was indis­ <lb/>
            pensable), and perhaps gave sureties for the judgment; the party <lb/>
            who showed cause might put in a counter affidavit; and evidence <lb/>
            might be offered on either side. It rested with the magistrate whe­ <lb/>
            ther he should grant the new trial or refuse it. Schömann thinks that <lb/>
            this was commonly decided by a jury. My view is, that the setting <lb/>
            aside of a judgment by default was in most cases the act of the magis­ <lb/>
            trate ; that such relief was given as a matter of right, if anything <lb/>
            like a reasonable ground was shown for it; that the magistrate never <lb/>
            refused it, when he himself thought that it was due; and that, <lb/>
            where he had doubts upon the subject only, he gave the mover an <note type="footnote"> Appeals from a magistrate to a jury upon the imposition of a fine, and from the <lb/>
            decision of the Demotae to a jury, upon the exclusion of a member from the register, <lb/>

             <pb n="394"/>
            opportunity of applying to a jury. For example; when the defendant <lb/>
            alleged that he had never been summoned, and the plaintiff's wit­ <lb/>
            nesses swore that he had been, the magistrate, if he had any doubt <lb/>
            about it, would leave him to indict thewitnesses before he granted a <lb/>
            new trial.1</p>
          <p>The second case in which a judgment could be set aside was, where <lb/>
            the verdict of the court had been procured by false testimony.</p>
          <p>It has dready been mentioned that a false witness was liable to an <lb/>
            action at the suit of the injured party. In such an action the main <lb/>
            questions, as upon an indictment for perjury in our country, were, <lb/>
            1. whether the evidence given was true or false; 2. whether it was <lb/>
            material to the decision of the original cause. If it in any way <lb/>
            could have had an influence in procuring that verdict, by which the <lb/>
            suitor sustained an injury, the false witness was liable to make him <lb/>
            compensation. It is obvious however, that the recovery of damages <lb/>
            from the witness could not always be a compensation for the injury <lb/>
            he had done. Thus, a lost inheritance involved the loss of family <lb/>
            rights, sacred and civil, which no money could either recompense or <lb/>
            restore. The very house or land might be endeared to the owner by <lb/>
            a thousand recollections. In such a case justice required, that the <lb/>
            mischief should be undone rather than paid for. The Athenian law <lb/>
            therefore allowed the party, upon conviction of one or more of the <lb/>
            witnesses by whose false testimony he lost the verdict, to obtain <lb/>
            a new trial. Many similar examples may be conceived, in which <lb/>
            a new trial would be equally just and desirable; and we should be <lb/>
            glad to know when, and how, and under what regulations and restric­ <lb/>
            tions this right could be exercised. Unfortunately we have but <lb/>
            scanty information upon the subject; and that cannot be de­ <lb/>
            pended on.</p>
          <p>It is said by the Scholiast on Plato,2 that new trials could be <lb/>
            obtained on this ground in inheritance causes, in suits for false testi­ <lb/>
            mony, and upon mdictments for usurpation of civic rights—but in no <lb/>
            other instances. There could certainly be no reason for confining the <lb/>
            remedy to these cases; and the correctness of the statement has <lb/>
            been justly questioned by Schömann. The Scholiast was manifestly <lb/>
            wrong upon another point-where he says that, in order to get a new <lb/>
            trial, it was necessary to convict more than half the number of wit­ <lb/>
            nesses. This statement, which does not agree with what we read in <lb/>
            Isæus,3 is in fact a misapprehension of Plato himself, who, without <lb/>
            saying that the law was so at Athens, recommends that it should be <lb/>
            in his imaginary republic. To make it a condition for a new trial, <lb/>
            that a given number of the witnesses should be convicted, was <note type="footnote"> (1) See Meier and Schömann, Att. Proc. 753—759. The expression for obtaining <lb/>
            a new trial after judgment by default was, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν ἔρημον ἀντιλαχε</foreign>ĩ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ν</foreign>, so. <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίκην</foreign> The <lb/>

              an idea more fit for a philosopher than for a lawyer. Another of his <lb/>
              rules, that the jury should decide whether the false evidence had <lb/>
              procured the verdict, was more probably founded on the practice of <lb/>
              his own country. We may perhaps assume, that upon its being <lb/>
              expressly found by the jury, that the false evidence had been instru­ <lb/>
              mental in producing such result, the reversal of the judgment followed <lb/>
              as a matter of course. 1</p>

          <p>IT has sometimes been regretted by law-reformers in this country, <lb/>
            that we have no domestic tribunals, to which disputes may be referred <lb/>
            in the first instance for amicable adjustment, without resorting to <lb/>
            the more troublesome and costly process of a lawsuit. In some <lb/>
            countries there are such tribunals; they are called courts of recon­ <lb/>
            ciliation ; their object, as the name itself denotes, is to reconcile the <lb/>
            parties; and, to effect such purpose the more completely, they <lb/>
            profess being to act on principles of substantial justice and equity, without <lb/>
            being bound by legal technicalities.2</p>
          <p>Though we have no public tribunals of this kind in England, <lb/>
            references of disputes to private arbitration are very common, as <lb/>
            well after an action has been commenced as before. A brief sketch <lb/>
            of our own practice will not be uninteresting to the scholar, as intro­ <lb/>
            ductory to the subject of the Athenian.</p>
          <p>Nor need I to apologise for the course which I have occasionally <lb/>
            taken in this book, of referring to the practice of English law, for <lb/>
            the purpose of illustration and comparison. Had I followed the <lb/>
            bent of my own inclination, I should have done so much more <lb/>
            frequently. For of what use can it be to an English gentleman, to <lb/>
            cram his head with the terms of Attic process, when he is utterly <lb/>
            ignorant of that of his own country ? It is only by some acquaint­ <lb/>
            ance with the latter that he is competent to understand the former. <lb/>
            Learning should not be one-sided; nor should names be taught <lb/>
            without things. It is this which makes the pedant; a genus, of <lb/>
            which there are too many among us. <note type="footnote"> . (1) See the Attic Process, p. 761. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) One of the principal objects of arbitration originally was to have settlements <lb/>

          <p>It was always open to parties in this country, to refer a matter in <lb/>
            dispute to the decision of some third person, under an agreement <lb/>
            between themselves that he should have power to determine it. But <lb/>
            there was this disadvantage. If the losing party refused to per­ <lb/>
            form the award, there was no power of compelling him. The <lb/>
            only remedy was to bring an action on the agreement, or upon the <lb/>
            original matter in dispute: but the benefit of the reference was <lb/>
            almost entirely lost.</p>
          <p>This inconvenience was obviated partly by the courts of law, and <lb/>
            partly by the legislature. Where an action was pending, and the <lb/>
            parties wished to refer it to arbitration, they obtained leave to do so, <lb/>
            and a rule of court was drawn up for that purpose: the effect of <lb/>
            the rule was, that the arbitration was conducted under the authority <lb/>
            of the court, and the parties were amenable to its jurisdiction; so <lb/>
            that, if any of them disobeyed the award after it was duly made and <lb/>
            published, the judges would punish him for contempt of court; <lb/>
            while on the other hand, if the arbitrator misbehaved himself, or if <lb/>
            the award was manifestly illegal, they would set it aside; and, in <lb/>
            short, they exercised a general superintendence over the whole affair <lb/>
            of the reference. It was in the reign of Charles II. that this practice <lb/>
            began; and it was found to work so well, that in the reign of <lb/>
            William III. a statute was passed, enabling parties before action to <lb/>
            submit their disputes to arbitration on the same terms as after action, <lb/>
            by agreeing that their submission should be made a rule of court, <lb/>
            and thus making the award enforceable by attachment. 1 <note type="footnote"> (1) The statute is the 9 and 10 William III. c. 15. It consists of two sections, <lb/>
            which I subjoin. </note><note type="footnote"> I. Whereas it has been found by experience that references made by rule of court <lb/>
            have contributed much to the ease of the subject in determining of controversies, <lb/>
            because the parties become thereby obliged to submit to the award of the arbitrators <lb/>
            under the penalty of imprisonment for their contempt in case they refuse submission. <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>According to the practice thus established arbitration is for the <lb/>
            most part carried on in England at the present day. Strange indeed <lb/>
            to say, notwithstanding the advantage of referring matters in difference <lb/>
            before litigation, it is more customary to do so after it has commenced. <lb/>
            The course pursued is usually as follows. In the progress of a cause <lb/>
            the parties become convinced, that a court of law is not the fittest <lb/>
            tribunal to decide the points at issue between them; for instance, <lb/>
            where there are long and intricate accounts to go through, or details <lb/>
            that require the attention of scientific persons; or where there is <lb/>
            a family quarrel that ought not to be dragged before the public; or <lb/>
            wherever the dispute is of such a nature, as to require an equitable <lb/>
            adjustment rather than a single peremptory decision. Strong feelings <lb/>
            have in the first instance hurried the plaintiff into an action, and pre­ <lb/>
            vented the defendant from offering any reasonable terms. Reflexion <lb/>
            afterwards, or the fear of expense and exposure, induce them to con­ <lb/>
            sent to a reference. An order for that purpose is made by a Judge <lb/>
            at chambers. Often, after the cause has been brought into court and <lb/>
            even partly heard, the Judge himself, seeing the difficulties which <lb/>
            attend the trial, and the impossibility of meeting the exigencies of <lb/>
            the case by a verdict, will advise a reference. By a late statute the <lb/>
            judges are empowered, upon an application by either of the parties, <lb/>
            to order a cause to be referred, where the questions turn upon matters <lb/>
            of account, which cannot conveniently be tried by a jury.1</p>
          <p>A single arbitrator is generally appointed, when a cause is referred; <lb/>
            as a barrister, a surveyor, an engineer, or any other person whose <lb/>
            professional knowledge fits him to be a judge of the case. It is not <lb/>
            unusual for each party to appoint one referee, with power to nominate <lb/>
            a third in case of a difference of opinion. Such third person is called <lb/>
            an umpire.</p>
          <p>Let us now see what was the practice of the Athenians when they <lb/>
            referred their disputes to arbitration.</p>
          <p>That a vast deal of business was done by arbitrators at Athens, <lb/>
            appears clearly enough from the private speeches of the orators. To <lb/>
            understand what we read about them, we must first distinguish between <lb/>
            two different kinds of arbitrators, the official or public, who were <lb/>
            appointed by the state, and the private ones, who were chosen by the <lb/>
            parties.</p>
          <p>The official or public arbitrators were a sort of inferior judges, forty <lb/>
            in number, four being chosen by lot annually from each tribe. They <lb/>
            were required to be at least fifty years of age, and took an oath to . <note type="footnote">IT. And be it enacted, that any arbitration or umpirage procured by corruption or <lb/>
            undue means shall be judged and esteemed void and of non-effect, and accordingly be <lb/>
            set aside by any court of law or equity, so as complaint of such corruption or undue <lb/>
            practice be made in the court where the rule is made for submission to such arbitra­ <lb/>
            tion or umpirage before the last day of the next term after such arbitration or <lb/>
            umpirage made and published to the parties. </note><note type="footnote"> (1) By the 17 and 18 Victoria, chapter 125, sections 3 and 6. They may refer the <lb/>

            to an officer of the court, or, in the case of country causes, to a county court judge. <lb/>
            I </note> <lb/>

            discharge their duties faithfully.1 Like all persons holding offices <lb/>
            of trust, they were liable at the end of their official term to be <lb/>
            called to account for misconduct: in what manner, will be explained <lb/>
            presently.</p>
          <p>Their jurisdiction was limited to civil actions, or at least to causes <lb/>
            in the nature of civil actions. It was subordinate in every case to that <lb/>
            of the superintending magistrate; and it was subject to appeal; but <lb/>
            there was no limit to the amount of the claim which they were em­ <lb/>
            powered to try. Anciently all causes were brought before them in <lb/>
            the first instance, in order to save the cost of the jury process. After­ <lb/>
            wards it was left to the option of the plaintiff, whether he would have <lb/>
            his cause sent to an arbitrator or a jury. After the commencement <lb/>
            of the action, and commonly on the first day of hearing in the magis­ <lb/>
            trate's office, he signified his intention. If he chose to have the trial <lb/>
            before an arbitrator, the magistrate assigned him one, chosen by lot, <lb/>
            out of the tribe of the defendant. 2</p>
          <p>To the arbitrator thus chosen the cause, together with its pleadings <lb/>
            and other documents, was transferred. He proceeded to hear the <lb/>
            parties and to receive the evidence, or such further evidence as was <lb/>
            required, in short, to prepare the case for decision, in the same way as <lb/>
            the magistrate would have done if the cause had been intended for a <lb/>
            jury.3 He united in himself the functions of the magistrate and the <lb/>
            jury; having not only the instructio litis to perform, but also to pro­ <lb/>
            nounce an award. And in preparing the case for decision it was <lb/>
            necessary for him to be quite as careful as the magistrate, because in <lb/>
            the event of an appeal the evidence, as prepared by him, had to be <lb/>
            sent up to the superior court.4 He therefore sat from day to day, as <lb/>
            long as there remained any evidence to produce, or any other preli­ <lb/>
            minary process to execute. When he was satisfied that the cause <lb/>
            was ripe for decision, he appointed a day for final hearing; upon <lb/>
            which each party came prepared to close his case, and perhaps to sum <lb/>
            up his evidence in a short speech. If either of the parties failed to <lb/>
            attend, the arbitrators might pronounce judgment by default, (which <lb/>
            might be set aside on a motion, properly supported, within ten days;) <lb/>
            but he had the same power as the magistrate to receive excuses and <lb/>
            grant adjournments. 5 Upon the attendance of both parties and in <lb/>
            their presence he declared his award, and forthwith made a return <lb/>
            thereof (together with all documents in the cause) to the super­ <lb/>
            intending magistrate, by whom the award was countersigned and <note type="footnote"> (1) Hudtwalcker, Ueber die Diäteten, 1, 5, 8, 40. All the authorities on the <lb/>

              entered upon record. The documents were carefully kept in the <lb/>
              office, to be ready in the event of an appeal.1</p>
          <p>The plaintiff paid to the arbitrator in the first instance a fee or <lb/>
            a drachm; and each of the parties paid him another drachm upon his <lb/>
            administering to them the customary oaths.2 This for his time and <lb/>
            trouble was not too high a remuneration. He rendered a more than <lb/>
            equivalent service, by relieving them from the anxiety attendant upon <lb/>
            a trial by jury, where the result was so hazardous and so precarious, <lb/>
            so much depending on a powerful address, or a clever statement of <lb/>
            the case, or even upon the exertion of private influence. The judg­ <lb/>
            ment of the arbitrator drew with it no penal consequences either to <lb/>
            the plaintiff or defendant, beyond the loss of the cause or the amount <lb/>
            of damages. The proceedings before him were less formal and <lb/>
            solemn. He would allow the parties to address him in a familiar <lb/>
            way, as often as any new point or argument arose: and no one would <lb/>
            ever think of having a speech prepared by counsel to be spoken <lb/>
            before him. There seem to have been no regular places assigned for <lb/>
            the arbitrators to hold their sittings: they used the Heliæa, or any <lb/>
            other court or public room that was vacant, according as it was found <lb/>
            convenient. It does not appear that there were any spectators in <lb/>
            attendance, as there were in the jury courts; and we may easily <lb/>
            imagine that a trial before an arbitrator would have but little interest <lb/>
            for strangers. The power of appeal must have operated as a check <lb/>
            upon misbehaviour. We know indeed, that the appeals from the <lb/>
            decision of arbitrators were very numerous; but this was no more <lb/>
            than might have been expected. There could not (as a general rule) <lb/>
            be any great confidence in the arbitrators, who were appointed at <lb/>
            hap-hazard, and not on account of their ability. The resort to them <lb/>
            was frequently intended as a tentative process, by which suitors felt <lb/>
            their way through the case. The losing party is always dissatisfied: <lb/>
            and at Athens he was encouraged to appeal by the facilities and the <lb/>
            chances which the law afforded him.</p>
          <p>The most effectual check to any corruption or negligence on the <lb/>
            part of the arbitrators was their official responsibility, for which an <lb/>
            ample provision was made by the law. Our knowledge upon this <lb/>
            subject is derived from the Oration of Demosthenes against Midias, <lb/>
            (see ante, p. 94,) from Harpocration, and the comment of Ulpian. <lb/>
            Itappears that in the month of Thargelion, the last month but one of <lb/>
            the year, (after which their duties entirely ceased, for there was no <lb/>
            judicial business done in the month of Scirophorion,) the public <lb/>
            arbitrators were bound every day at a certain time to attend in the <lb/>
            office of the Auditors, in order that suitors or any persons who had <lb/>
            suffered by their neglect of duty might have an opportunity to accuse <lb/>
            them. If any accusation was preferred, it was brought to trial in due <note type="footnote"> (1) Hudtwalcker, Ueber die Diäteten, 82. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) The fee was called <foreign xml:lang="grc">παράστασις</foreign> Hudtwalcker, ibid. 14. </note><note type="footnote"> (3) Ibid. 12. </note> <lb/>

            course by the Auditors, and the penalty upon conviction was dis­ <lb/>
            franchisement. The process against them, according to Harpocration, <lb/>
            was an impeachment. It is a matter of no great importance, what it <lb/>
            was called: yet I should rather judge that Harpocration was wrong, <lb/>
            and that the proceeding was by indictment, and not impeachment.1</p>
          <p>Demosthenes relates how Midias contrived to revenge himself on <lb/>
            the arbitrator Straton, who had given an award against him for non- <lb/>
            appearance. Straton attended before the Auditors every day of the <lb/>
            month but the last, which, being the first day of the new moon, was <lb/>
            by vulgar error confounded sometimes with the first of the next <lb/>
            month. Midias came on that day, the thirtieth of Thargelion, and <lb/>
            preferred a charge against Straton, who not being in attendance, as <lb/>
            he ought to have been, suffered judgment by default, and incurred the <lb/>
            penalty of disfranchisement. Demosthenes complains that Straton <lb/>
            was never summoned to answer the charge, contrary to the practice <lb/>
            upon ordinary prosecutions, which required that the accused party <lb/>
            should receive a personal summons, and that it should be proved by <lb/>
            witnesses. But here occurs a question-Why should it be necessary <lb/>
            to summon the arbitrator, when he was bound to appear before the <lb/>
            Auditors for the very purpose of answering any charge that might be <lb/>
            brought against him ? Ulpian, by way of explaining this, suggests <lb/>
            that it was the practice for the arbitrators to be at hand to answer <lb/>
            complaints, but that they were under no legal obligation to do so.2 <lb/>
            Hudtwalcker observes upon it as follows: 3</p>
          <p>" It is a surprising circumstance, when the arbitrators were obliged <lb/>
            to attend every day of the month Thargelion in the market-place, that <lb/>
            the complainant should have to summon them previously. At the <lb/>
            first sight it does not appear why that should be necessary. The <lb/>
            difficulty vanishes however, when one considers that security had to <lb/>
            be provided for both parties-for the complainant, lest the arbitrators <lb/>
            should by excuses of absence and other means drag the thing on to <lb/>
            the end of the month; for the arbitrators, to prevent their being sur­ <lb/>
            prised by malicious accusers."</p>
          <p>This is not satisfactory. It appears indeed to have been the law, <lb/>
            that no accusation could be preferred after the last day of Thargelion. <lb/>
            But, if any one preferred his charge within the month, it could be <lb/>
            tried afterwards, however the time might be spun out by the ma­ <lb/>
            noeuvres of the defendant. And on whatever day an accuser might <note type="footnote"> (1) He perhaps got his information from Demosthenes, and was misled by the ex­ <lb/>

              choose to appear against the arbitrator, he would doubtless have <lb/>
              ample time allowed him to prepare his defence. We are not to sup* <lb/>
              pose that, if the charge was preferred on the last day of the month, <lb/>
              it was also to be tried on that day.</p>
          <p>The learned commentator has fallen into the error of supposing, <lb/>
            that the complaint of Demosthenes must be well founded. Yet, if it <lb/>
            were so, why did not Straton take measures to set aside the judg­ <lb/>
            ment ? This of course would have been open to him, if a summons <lb/>
            had been necessary and he had not received one. Again, if any wrong <lb/>
            was done him, the auditors were more to blame than Midias; for they <lb/>
            should have seen that the summons was duly proved by witnesses. <lb/>
            It is observable also, that Demosthenes does not allege directly, that <lb/>
            the judgment against Straton was illegal, but only insinuates it, or <lb/>
            rather puts it as a matter of aggravation, that he should have been <lb/>
            condemned in his absence without any notice, the main charge against <lb/>
            Midias being, that he had been guilty of sharp practice, and taken <lb/>
            advantage of the ignorance of a man who was no lawyer.</p>
          <p>We have now to speak of the private arbitrators at Athens.</p>
          <p>These were persons to whom a dispute was referred by agreement <lb/>
            of the parties. Their power depended on the terms of the reference. <lb/>
            It was usual, before commencing an action, to try what could be done <lb/>
            by the mediation of friends. They would endeavour, by advice and <lb/>
            persuasion, to reconcile the parties, or at least to bring them to some <lb/>
            amicable arrangement.1 But if the parties desired to terminate their <lb/>
            dispute finally, without the risk and publicity of a lawsuit, there was <lb/>
            no better way, than to submit all their matters in difference to the <lb/>
            judgment of some person, in whom they both had confidence. An <lb/>
            agreement was then drawn up whereby they mutually engaged to. <lb/>
            abide by his decision. He was bound by oath to decide impartially, <lb/>
            and after hearing the case on both sides, gave his award in writing. <lb/>
            Such award had the force of a judgment, and could be pleaded as <lb/>
            such; nor was it subject to appeal. Herein lay the chief difference <lb/>
            between the award of a public and the award of a private arbitrator, <lb/>
            as we learn from the law cited in the Oration against Midias, (ante, <lb/>
            p. 97.)2 Yet it appears that at any time before the award was actually <lb/>
            published either of the parties were at liberty to revoke the submis­ <lb/>
            sion. Thus Demosthenes and Aphobus referred their dispute to <lb/>
            three private persons; but Aphobus, seeing that, if they were allowed <lb/>
            to proceed, they would make an award against him, revoked their <lb/>
            authority; upon which Demosthenes, having brought an action, carried <lb/>
            it before a public arbitrator, from whose decision Aphobus appealed.'</p>
          <p>The reference was commonly made either to a single person or to <lb/>
            three. If the last, two of them were commonly the friends and <note type="footnote"> (1) Such persons were called <foreign xml:lang="grc">διαλλακταί</foreign>. They were like the disceptatores domestici <lb/>

            nominees of the respective parties, and the third was an impartial <lb/>
            umpire between them. This was the case in the reference between <lb/>
            Demosthenes and Aphobus.1</p>
          <p>A public arbitrator might be chosen, like any other man, to act as <lb/>
            a private referee. His official character would in some measure be <lb/>
            a recommendation, and still more so, if he had had some experience <lb/>
            and got a reputation for deciding justly. Straton, as we have seen, <lb/>
            was a public arbitrator, and to him the cause of Demosthenes against <lb/>
            Midias was referred by consent.2</p>
          <p>Sometimes parties agreed to compromise their disputes upon certain <lb/>
            terms, and appointed an arbitrator for the sole purpose of carrying <lb/>
            the arrangement into effect. He then had no discretionary power, <lb/>
            but was simply to make an award according to the terms agreed on. <lb/>
            The award thus made was like any other award, a bar to a future <lb/>
            action. The following passage from the Oration of Isocrates against <lb/>
            Callimachus will illustrate this, as well as some other points that we <lb/>
            have been considering: 3</p>
          <p>" I was at last prevailed upon (for the whole truth shall be told <lb/>
            you) to give the plaintiff two hundred drachms. And, to put it out <lb/>
            of his power to trump up a new demand, we appointed Nicomachus <lb/>
            of Bate to arbitrate between us under terms.4</p>
          <p>" At first he kept to the agreement: but afterwards having con­ <lb/>
            spired with Xenotimus, (the man who garbles the laws and bribes the <lb/>
            courts and corrupts the magistrates and contrives all kinds of mischief,) <lb/>
            he brings an action against me for ten thousand drachms. Upon my <lb/>
            tendering an affidavit, that the action was barred by an award, he took <lb/>
            no proceedings against the witness, knowing that, if he did not get <lb/>
            a fifth part of the votes, he should be mulcted in a sixth of the <lb/>
            damages, but he got leave of the magistrate and entered the same <lb/>
            action again, so as to risk payment of the court-fees only.5 Finding <lb/>
            myself in a difficulty, I thought it best to let us both take an equal <lb/>
            chance, and to come into court before you. These are the facts.</p>
          <p>" I hear that Callimachus not only means to support his claim by false­ <lb/>
            hood, but intends to deny the award, and is prepared with an argument <lb/>
            of this sort, that he should never have submitted to the arbitration <lb/>
            of Nicomachus, whom lie knew to be on intimate terms with me, <lb/>
            and that it was not likely he should accept two hundred drachms in <lb/>
            lieu of ten thousand. But remember, in the first place, we submitted <note type="footnote"> (1) Compare the Oration coat. Apaturium, 897. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) Ante, p. 96.

              to arbitration not as contesting parties, but under terms of com­ <lb/>
              promise; so that there was nothing strange in his choosing Nicoma­ <lb/>
              chus for arbitrator; indeed it would have been much more strange <lb/>
              if, having agreed upon the case, he had quarrelled about the arbitra­ <lb/>
              tor.1 In the next place, though it was not likely that, if ten thousand <lb/>
              drachms were due to him, he would have settled for two minas, yet, <lb/>
              if he were making an unjust and vexatious demand, there is nothing <lb/>
              wonderful in his choosing to take that sum. Further, if upon a large <lb/>
              claim he recovered a very little, it is no proof for him that the award <lb/>
              has never been made, but a very strong proof for me that his claim <lb/>
              was altogether unfounded. I wonder he thinks himself clever enough <lb/>
              to see, that it was unlikely he should accept two hundred drachms <lb/>
              for ten thousand, yet does not suppose me able to have discovered, <lb/>
              that, if I wished to tell a falsehood, I ought to have said he had given <lb/>
              a larger sum. I submit that, as it would have been a proof for the <lb/>
              plaintiff, that there had been no award, if he had convicted the person <lb/>
              who swore the affidavit, it should be equally good proof of the truth <lb/>
              of my statement, when it appears that he ventured not to take any <lb/>
              proceedings against the witness."</p>

            <title type="sub">CLUBS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THE institution of clubs, both for social and for political purposes, <lb/>
            has been common in all ages, from the time of the Athenian Erant to <lb/>
            the Jacobin clubs of Paris. The most ancient kind were the convivial. <lb/>
            It was common among the early Greeks for friends to meet together <lb/>
            and have a dinner or supper at their joint expense. This was done <lb/>
            either by each bringing his own provisions with him, as they do at <lb/>
            our picnics, or by each contributing his share in money and deputing <lb/>
            one to cater for the rest. Homer and Hesiod allude to banquets of <lb/>
            this sort.2 There is frequent mention of them by writers who describe <lb/>
            the customs of later periods, as Aristophanes, Xenophon, Athenaeus, <lb/>
            and others.3 The Athenians, an eminently convivial people, were <figure type="illustration">

              fond of picnics, as they were of feasting in general, and frequently <lb/>
              made up parties to dine in the country or at the sea-side, or at the <lb/>
              town-house of one of the company, or even at less reputable places. <lb/>
              Thus, Antipho says in Terence's play of the Eunuch, Act III. <lb/>
              Scene 4.- <lb/>
              Heri aliquot adolescentuli coiimus in Piræo, <lb/>
              In hunc them ut de symbolis essemus. Chæream ei rei <lb/>
              Præfecimus: dati annuli: locus, tempus constitutum est. <lb/>
              where symbolœ1 are the subscriptions to the feast; annuli the rings <lb/>
              given as pledges by each of the messmates.</p>
          <p>The convivial habits of the Athenians led them to form permanent <lb/>
            clubs for dining together at stated periods, as once a month, or oftener. <lb/>
            Each club had its president, Eranarches, who took the chair (as we <lb/>
            should say) at the banquets: also its rules and bye-laws, fixing the <lb/>
            places of meeting, the amount of subscription, and other matters.</p>
          <p>Nothing was more natural than that persons who met frequently <lb/>
            at the same table should increase their intimacy, and then combine <lb/>
            together for further objects. Clubs which originally were associations <lb/>
            for good cheer and good fellowship, were enlarged into institutions <lb/>
            for mutual assistance and relief; bearing a resemblance to our friendly <lb/>
            societies, but differing in this, that they did not raise any permanent <lb/>
            fund, or regulate their charities upon any fixed plan. There is a good <lb/>
            deal of obscurity upon the subject of these Athenian societies. With <lb/>
            respect to their objects-it is not to be supposed that every club <lb/>
            existed both for feasting and for charity; nor on the other hand can <lb/>
            I accede to Meier's view, that the two kinds of clubs were always <lb/>
            distinct. It is likely enough that there should be purely convivial <lb/>
            clubs: but when other objects were proposed, the monthly feast <lb/>
            would rarely, I should think, be omitted. Athenians were too like <lb/>
            Englishmen for that.</p>
          <p>The mode of dispensing relief was simple. When a man was <lb/>
            reduced to distress by illness or other misfortune, he applied to his <lb/>
            club for assistance; and each member was expected to contribute <lb/>
            something. The president collected subscriptions for him, and some­ <lb/>
            times advanced them in the first instance out of his own pocket, as <lb/>
            he might advance the money for a dinner. The relief thus afforded <figure type="illustration">

              was, as Meier says, neither a gift nor a loan, but something between <lb/>
              the two. Whether it was a debt recoverable at law, as Meier thinks, <lb/>
              when the relieved party was in better circumstances, is doubtful. 1 It <lb/>
              was at all events a debt of honour; and it was considered highly dis­ <lb/>
              graceful for any man, who had accepted the bounty of his friends, not <lb/>
              to repay them when he had the means. Club debts in general were <lb/>
              among the first which an Athenian thought it incumbent on him to <lb/>
              discharge. Even Leocrates, who deserted his country, sent a com­ <lb/>
              mission from Megara to his brother, desiring him to pay his club debts <lb/>
              at Athens.</p>
          <p>There were public laws applicable to the clubs, and courts of <lb/>
            speedy justice enforcing their rules and deciding disputes which arose <lb/>
            under them.2 The president would be able to recover all sums which <lb/>
            he had either an express or implied authority to advance; or he might <lb/>
            be called to account for any misapplication of the common funds; or <lb/>
            the members might sue one another for contribution. It is very likely <lb/>
            that a more equitable kind of law was administered upon such trials. <lb/>
            They were conducted by the Thesmothetæ.3</p>
          <p>The formation of societies was common in the Greek republics. <lb/>
            There were commercial, religious, and political societies.4 That there <lb/>
            should be political associations in cities where the spirit of party ran <lb/>
            high, was a thing to be expected. Many, which had a different object <lb/>
            at first, were diverted to political ends. Pisander and Phrynichus at <lb/>
            Athens engaged the clubs to assist them in their project of over­ <lb/>
            throwing the democracy.6 Lysander, to forward his own ambitious <lb/>
            views, established clubs in Asia Minor. Thucydides, in commenting <lb/>
            upon the violence of the Greek factions, expressly declares, that men <lb/>
            felt a stronger attachment to their political associates than to their <lb/>
            country. 6 A bond of union thus formed became stronger often than <lb/>
            the ties of moral obligation, and led to mischievous consequences. <lb/>
            The caballing in courts of justice, to which so much allusion is made <lb/>
            by the orators, may be traced to the like source. A word, which <lb/>
            (according to its natural import) might signify the whole preparation <lb/>
            for conducting a cause, was understood often in a more limited sense <note type="footnote"> (1) The words of Isaeus, De Hagn. Hered. 88, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξ ἐράνων ὀφλήματα εἰσπεπραγμένα</foreign>, <lb/>

              to signify a troop of friends, who, by their appearance in court, as <lb/>
              well as by open intercession or pleading, endeavoured to influence the</p>
          <p>Thirlwall in his History of Greece (IV. 36) gives a good description <lb/>
            of the party feeling, which these political associations engendered:—</p>
          <p>" In most of the Greek states the ambition of individuals, or the <lb/>
            conflict of parties, had given rise to a number of private associations, <lb/>
            for purposes either wholly or mainly political, some attached to a <lb/>
            single leader, others united by the common interests of the members. <lb/>
            These clubs were of long standing at Athens. Cimon had formed one, <lb/>
            which rallied round him as its centre, attracted not more perhaps by <lb/>
            his fortune and abilities than by his principles, shared the reproach <lb/>
            which he had incurred by his partiality for Sparta, and proved its <lb/>
            devotedness to his person at the battle of Tanagra. It seems to have <lb/>
            been by means of a similar union that Thucydides, the rival of Pericles, <lb/>
            endeavoured to collect and guide the strength of the aristocratical <lb/>
            party. It was so perhaps that Nicias and Alcibiades had been able <lb/>
            to defeat the attempt of Hyperbolus. It was on his command over <lb/>
            such associations that Alcibiades relied for the accomplishment of his <lb/>
            ambitious designs. But there appear to have been many political <lb/>
            clubs at Athens, which did not acknowledge any chief, but merely <lb/>
            aimed at certain objects in which all the members were equally con­ <lb/>
            cerned. The defective administration of justice exposed unprotected <lb/>
            individuals to vexation and wrong, but enabled a number who com­ <lb/>
            bined their fortunes and credit the more easily to shield each other, <lb/>
            or to strike a common enemy. Another end for which such coalitions <lb/>
            were formed, was to control the elections for offices of trust and <lb/>
            power, either with a view to self-defence, or to the extension of their <lb/>
            influence. In every case both the object and the means, if not posi­ <lb/>
            tively illegal, were such as the law did not recognise; the mutual <lb/>
            attachment of the associates was stronger than the ties by which <lb/>
            they were bound to the state, and even than those of blood; and the <lb/>
            law of honour which generally prevailed among them required that <lb/>
            they should shrink from no sacrifice and from no crime, which the <lb/>
            common interest might demand. These associations therefore were <lb/>
            hotbeds of seditious and revolutionary projects; and Phrynichus found <lb/>
            it easy to engage them on his side; and before he left Athens, he had <lb/>
            organized an extensive conspiracy among them for the immediate <lb/>
            subversion of the democratical government.”</p>
          <p>In the days of the Roman empire we read of institutions formed <lb/>
            for benevolent purposes, although the government kept a watchful <lb/>
            eye upon them, for fear of their leading to political combination, and <lb/>
            did not allow the members to meet more than once a month. Trajan, <lb/>
            in answer to a letter from Pliny, consulting him about such an insti­ <lb/>
            tution in a city of Cappadocia, says: :2 " Amisenos, quorum libellum <lb/>
            epistolæ tuæ subjunxeras, si legibus istorum, quibus de officio fœderis <note type="footnote"> (1) <foreign xml:lang="grc">Παρασκευή</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote">(2) Pliny, Epist. x. 93. </note> <lb/>

            utuntur, concessum est eranos habere, possumus quo minus habeant <lb/>
            non impedire ; eo facilius si tali collatione non ad turbos et illicitos <lb/>
            cœtus, sed ad sustinendam tenuiorum inopiam utuntur. In ceteris <lb/>
            civitatibus, quæ nostro jure obstrictæ sunt, res hujusmodi prohibenda <lb/>
            est." When the Christian communities were accused of factious <lb/>
            intentions, because they met together and subscribed to a common <lb/>
            chest, Tertullian answered, that the subscriptions were of small <lb/>
            amount, and not for feasting, but for charity; "deposita pietatis, <lb/>
            egenis alendis humandisque, et pueris ac puellis, re sic parentibus <lb/>
            destitutis, jamque domesticis senibus."</p>
          <p>The gilds or (guilds) of the Anglo-Saxons were associations for <lb/>
            mutual contribution, to meet various exigencies arising from burials, <lb/>
            legal exactions, mulcts, fines, and other payments. In mercantile <lb/>
            towns and seaports there were gilds for carrying on commercial en­ <lb/>
            terprise. They met in their gihalla, or guildhall. That of the burghers <lb/>
            of Dover is mentioned in Domesday Book. The word is derived from <lb/>
            gildan, to pay.</p>
          <p>To enumerate the various clubs or societies which are established <lb/>
            in this country for purposes of all kinds-for politics and for amuse­ <lb/>
            ment, for feasting and for charity, for debating, gambling, building, <lb/>
            money-lending, &amp;c.—would be a difficult matter. Those which most <lb/>
            nearly resemble the best sort of Athenian erani are, as I have said, <lb/>
            our friendly Societies, which are established for provident and bene­ <lb/>
            volent purposes, chiefly for the benefit of the lower classes of people. <lb/>
            A fund is commonly raised by voluntary subscriptions, out of which <lb/>
            the members, their wives or children, relations or nominees, may be <lb/>
            maintained or relieved in old age, sickness, widowhood, or orphanage, <lb/>
            or upon any other contingency, the occurrence of which is susceptible <lb/>
            of calculation by way of average. Sometimes sums of money are <lb/>
            insured to be paid on the birth of a child or the death of a member, <lb/>
            or for funeral expenses; or provision is made for granting pensions <lb/>
            or emoluments at certain ages. Again, there are building societies <lb/>
            for enabling every member to become the owner of a freehold dwell­ <lb/>
            ing house after a certain number of years. All these associations <lb/>
            have been sanctioned by the legislature, which has made various <lb/>
            enactments for their good government and for the security of the <lb/>
            members; so that their funds may be safely invested, their accounts <lb/>
            duly audited, and their officers subject to proper checks. Before any <lb/>
            such society can be legally established, its proposed rules have to be <lb/>
            sent up to the general registry office in London and examined by the <lb/>
            registrar: if he approves of them, he gives a certificate, and thereupon <lb/>
            they become the guiding rules of the society, and binding upon all <lb/>
            parties concerned. One of the rules commonly is, that disputes <lb/>
            among the members may be settled by arbitration. And now by the <lb/>
            statute which consolidates the whole law upon the subject, the 18th <lb/>
            and 19th Victoria, chapter 63, not only the magistrates, but the judges <lb/>
            of the county courts, upon complaints preferred by members of Friendly <lb/>
            Societies, are empowered to give equitable relief.</p>
