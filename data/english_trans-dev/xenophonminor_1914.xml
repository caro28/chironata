            <title type="main">REMARKS ON THE AGESILAUS OF XENOPHON.</title>
          </head>
          <p>As Xenophon had been for several years the companion and <lb/>
            familiar friend of Agesilaus in Asia, and also, after the machinations of Tithraustes, in Greece, it is not surprising that he desired <lb/>
            to honour him after his death with a distinguished eulogy. That <lb/>
            the " Agesilaus " was written with this view is stated by the author <lb/>
            himself at the commencement of the treatise ; and that Xenophon <lb/>
            wished to present the example of an excellent king and general for <lb/>
            imitation is signified in the tenth chapter.</p>
          <p>The panegyric begins with a brief narrative of the military exploits <lb/>
            of Agesilaus, which is followed by an equally concise account of his <lb/>
            manners and character. Xenophon did not make it his object to <lb/>
            give a detail of the life of Agesilaus in precise conformity with <lb/>
            historical exactness ; for to write a panegyric is a far different task <lb/>
            from writing a biography : the biographer writes not only for his <lb/>
            contemporaries, but for posterity; but the panegyrist merely re­ <lb/>
            capitulates to the people of his own day what they have themselves <lb/>
            seen or known, and consequently thinks it sufficient to touch on <lb/>
            many of his facts, and to recall them to the memory of his readers, <lb/>
            in very few words; and hence it happens that various particu­ <lb/>
            lars in this little treatise are related with great brevity, and, though <lb/>
            well known in the time of Xenophon, are obscure to us. Such <lb/>
            are those which we read in the second chapter, sect. 25. seqq. ; <lb/>
            nor would those which are told in sect. 6 and 20 be sufficiently in­ <lb/>
            telligible, if we had not a knowledge of them from other sources.</p>
          <p>But the greatest difference between the biographer and the en­ <lb/>
            comiast is, that the biographer has to relate everything that is of <lb/>
            importance to be known, for whatever reason, whether as deserving <note type="footnote"> VOL. III </note> <note type="footnote"> a </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="2"/>
            of praise or of censure, while the encomiast merely selects such <lb/>
            facts as may render the character of the person whom he praises <lb/>
            most worthy of admiration and most agreeable to contemplate. <lb/>
            Bearing this in mind, we shall not wonder that many circumstances <lb/>
            are omitted in the Agesilaus which are related in the Hellenica; <lb/>
            for Xenophon, in composing the eulogy of Agesilaus, has com­ <lb/>
            prised in it whatever would exhibit to advantage the character of <lb/>
            an excellent king and able general, but has passed over whatever <lb/>
            would contribute nothing to the praises of his hero. He has ac­ <lb/>
            cordingly made no mention of the envy with which Agesilaus is said <lb/>
            to have annoyed Lysander, Hellen. iii. 4. 7; of the Spartan cavalry <lb/>
            routed by that of Pharnabazus, iv. 3. 13; of the disaster of the <lb/>
            Spartans described iv. 6. 10; or of the fact that the seizure of the <lb/>
            Cadmeia was not disapproved by Agesilaus, v. 2. 32; since these <lb/>
            particulars could have no place in a panegyric.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, as many things are found in the Hellenics <lb/>
            which could not be included in the eulogy, so many are men­ <lb/>
            tioned in the eulogv which Xenophon regarded as having no <lb/>
            concern with the history of Greece. Of this sort are the accounts <lb/>
            of the descent and birth of Agesilaus, and of the power of the <lb/>
            Spartans, c. 1, sect. 2; of Agesilaus's singular contrivance for en­ <lb/>
            riching his soldiers, c. 17 ; of his mode of exercising and improving <lb/>
            his troops, c. 2, sect. 7, and of several other matters.</p>
          <p>The other portion of the treatise contains praises of the virtues <lb/>
            and merits of Agesilaus; and here, as elsewhere, Xenophon writes <lb/>
            as a disciple of Socrates. He first treats of the piety of Agesilaus, <lb/>
            c. 3, without a foundation in which no other virtue can be imagin­ <lb/>
            ed ; and then of three other virtues, which always hold a chief <lb/>
            place in the moral teaching of Socrates, justice, c. 4, temperance, <lb/>
            c. 5, and fortitude, c. 6; with fortitude is coupled patriotism, c. 7, <lb/>
            which, in a panegyric on a Spartan king, required particular notice ; <lb/>
            and after having enumerated the virtues of which every one who <lb/>
            would be a man of integrity and honour must be possessed, he <lb/>
            touches on those which are a credit to men of power and dignity, <lb/>
            as modesty, readiness to do services, cheerfulness, kindness, disre­ <lb/>
            gard of assumption and mere wealth, good faith towards allies, <lb/>
            contempt of external splendour and ostentation, and simplicity in <lb/>
            dress and living, c. 8. That the nature of this simplicity may be <lb/>
            more clearly exhibited, a comparison is then made, c. 9, between <lb/>
            Agesilaus and the king of Persia; and in the tenth chapter, Xenophon sets forth Agesilaus as an example in every way deserving of <lb/>
            imitation.</p>
          <p>The panegyric being thus, as is evident, properly and excellently <lb/>
            brought to a conclusion, it may seem strange that an eleventh <lb/>
            chapter is added. A glance at the contents of this chapter will <lb/>
            show that they want connexion and proper arrangement; but <lb/>
            what was the origin or object of the fragmentary sentences of <lb/>
             <pb n="3"/>
            which it is composed no critic has as yet clearly discovered. That <lb/>
            Schneider is greatly mistaken, in supposing that the principles and <lb/>
            sources of virtues are indicated in the chapter, is very plain. The <lb/>
            hypothesis adopted by Heiland is of a different nature, but not at <lb/>
            all nearer the truth: for he imagines that Xenophon thought of <lb/>
            correcting the Agesilaus, and noted down, for that purpose, the <lb/>
            sentences contained in this chapter, intending to substitute them <lb/>
            for what is now contained in the second portion of the panegyric. <lb/>
            These two points he has not made clear, as he ought to have done; <lb/>
            he has not shown why Xenophon should have meditated a correction of the treatise, nor proved that what he thinks Xenophon <lb/>
            would have substituted is better than what we now find. Sauppe <lb/>
            has given a more plausible opinion, as he felt persuaded that the <lb/>
            sentences forming the eleventh chapter were written, not after, <lb/>
            but before, the treatise was composed. BREITENBACH.</p>
          <p>After some further remarks, Breitenbach gives it as his opinion <lb/>
            (agreeing in this point with Sauppe and Heiland) that the sentences or memoranda constituting the eleventh chapter were found <lb/>
            after Xenophon's death, and that somebody composed an additional <lb/>
            chapter out of them, placing at the head of it the few introductory <lb/>
            words that now stand there.</p>
          <p>Valckenaer, on Herod. ix. 27, and some other critics, have expressed a suspicion that the " Agesilaus " is not Xenophon's, as the <lb/>
            style of it is more sustained than that of a great portion of his other <lb/>
            writings; but it can hardly be taken from him on this account, for <lb/>
            there are in the Cyropaedia, as Breitenbach observes, and in other <lb/>
            parts of Xenophon's works, many passages not less elevated in <lb/>
            diction, and some even more so, than any parts of the Agesilaus. <lb/>
            Both Weiske and Schneider agree in opposing Valckenaer.</p><pb n="4"/>

            attended by many of the Asiatic Greeks, whom he had attached to himself <lb/>
            by his kind and judicious conduct.</p>
          <p>1. I AM well aware that it is not easy to write an ade. <lb/>
            quate eulogium of either the virtues or glory of Agesilaus. <lb/>
            Eut the attempt must nevertheless be made; for it would not <lb/>
            be rignt, that because he was a thoroughly good man, he should <lb/>
            on this account fail of obtaining any praises, though even <lb/>
            less than he deserved. 1</p>
          <p>2. With respect then to his nobility of birth, what could <lb/>
            any one say of it, greater or more honourable, than that even <lb/>
            to the present day, when his ancestors are mentioned,2 it is <note type="footnote">' <foreign xml:lang="grc">Οὑδέ μειόνων ἑπαίνων</foreign>] Ne inferioresquidemvirtutibus.

            Breitenbach. He observes that such datives generally have a reference to <lb/>
            time in connexion with the nominative case to the verb on which they depend : and refers to Herod. ix. 10, <foreign xml:lang="grc">θυομένῳ</foreign> oi <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑπί τῳ̃ Πέρση οἢλιος</foreign> </note> <figure type="illustration">

              kings the descendants of kings. 3. Nor, indeed, as to this <lb/>
              point, could any one possibly disparage them, by saying that <note type="footnote"> <foreign xml:lang="grc">χάνουσι πρεσευται̃ς πορευομἑνοις κ τ. λ</foreign>. On this use of the dative he <lb/>

              1 The Lacedæmonians had always two kings, of the two families of Pro­ <lb/>

              Hercules. See C. Nep. Ages; c. 1. The subjoined table shows the descent <lb/>

              they were indeed kings, but kings of an ordinary state; I <lb/>
              for, as their family is the most honourable of their native land, <lb/>
              so their state is also the most renowned in Greece ; so that they <lb/>
              are not first amongst the second, but chief amongst the chief.2 <lb/>
              4. On this account, assuredly, it is right to eulogize alike 3 <lb/>
              both his native country and his family; for neither did the <lb/>
              state at any period, through envy of their preëminence in <lb/>
              honour, attempt to overthrow their authority; nor did the <lb/>
              kings ever aim at greater power than was consistent with the <lb/>
              terms on which they received the kingly authority at first.4 <lb/>
              Accordingly no other government is known, whether democratic, <lb/>
              or oligarchic, or tyrannic, or hereditary, that has continued <lb/>
              constantly uninterrupted, but this government alone maintains <lb/>
              an unbroken succession.</p>
          <p>. 5. That Agesilaus, however, even before he began to reign, <lb/>
            was thought worthy of the throne, the following circumstances <lb/>
            are proofs. For when Agis, who was king, died, and when <figure type="illustration">

              state, having decided that Agesilaus was more free from objection, both as to birth and merit, appointed him king. And, in <lb/>
              truth, when he was, in a most-powerful state, deemed by the <lb/>
              most honourable worthy of the highest honour, what furthel <lb/>
              proof is required of his merit, at least before he began to <lb/>
              reign ?</p>
          <p>6. It is the actions, however, which he performed during <lb/>
            his reign, that I shall now 2 relate; for from his actions I <lb/>
            consider that his character also will be best shown. Agesilaus, <lb/>
            then, while he was still in the prime of life,3 obtained the <lb/>
            kingly authority; and, when he was but just established in <lb/>

            was collecting a large naval and land force, as if intending to <lb/>
            make an attack upon the Greeks. 7. But while the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians and their allies were deliberating on these tidings, <lb/>
            Agesilaus offered,5 if they would give him thirty Spartans,6 <lb/>
            and two thousand neodamods,7 and the complement of allies, <lb/>
            to the number of six thousand, to crossover into Asia, and <note type="footnote"> 1 What is here attributed solely to the birth and merit of Agesilaus, was <lb/>

            endeavour to make peace ; or, if the barbarian preferred fighting, to allow him no leisure for marching against the Greeks <lb/>
            8. Immediately, then, many, since the Persian had formerly- <lb/>
            crossed over into Greece, greatly admired this desire of going <lb/>
            over against him, as well as the resolution to fight with him <lb/>
            by attacking rather than waiting to be attacked, and the wish <lb/>
            to carry on the war by consuming his resources, rather than <lb/>
            allowing those of the Greeks to be consumed; and it was <lb/>
            judged the most honourable of all things to make a struggle <lb/>
            for the dominion, not of Greece, but of Asia.</p>
          <p>9. But after he took his army and set sail, how can any one <lb/>
            more plainly show how he acted as commander, than by <lb/>
            narrating the actions themselves which he performed ? 10. <lb/>
            The following was his first action in Asia. Tissaphernes2 took <lb/>
            an oath to Agesilaus, that if he would make a truce until the <lb/>
            messenger whom he was sending to the king should return, <lb/>
            he would procure for him that the Greek cities in Asia should <lb/>
            be left independent; and Agesilaus took an oath on his part, <lb/>
            that he would observe the truce faithfully, prescribing three <lb/>
            months for the completion of the matter. 11. Tissaphernes, however, immediately violated the conditions to which he bad <lb/>
            sworn ; for, instead of keeping peace, he sent for a large force <lb/>
            from the king, in addition to that which he had before ; while <lb/>
            Agesilaus, though he was aware of this, nevertheless adhered <lb/>
            to the terms of the truce. 12. To me, then, he seems to have <lb/>
            done this, first of all, with great honour, as, by showing <lb/>
            Tissaphernes to be perjured, he caused him to be distrusted <lb/>
            by all; and by showing himself on his own part, first, as an observer of oaths, secondly, as no violator of agreements, he induced all, both Greeks and barbarians, to enter with him <lb/>
            confidently into any compact that he wished to make.</p>
          <p>13. But when Tissaphernes, greatly elated at the army <lb/>
            which came down to him; declared war against Agesilaus, <lb/>
            unless he should withdraw from Asia, the rest of the allies, <note type="footnote">not s( at out in those times to carry on war in distant countries, but the <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="§ 14-18.] "/>and the Lacedæmonians who were present, became manifestly much troubled, considering that the force then with <lb/>
            Agesilaus was inferior to the force of the king ; but Agesilaus, with a very cheerful countenance, ordered the ambassadors to report to Tissaphernes that he was under a great obligation to him ; because, by committing perjury, he had got <lb/>
            himself the gods for enemies, but had made them allies to the <lb/>
            Greeks. 14. Immediately after this he gave orders to his <lb/>
            soldiers to make preparations as if for an expedition ; and <lb/>
            he sent notice to the cities, to which it was necessary for him <lb/>
            to go in marching into Caria, to prepare provisions for sale ; <lb/>
            he also directed the Ionians, Æolians, and dwellers near the <lb/>
            Hellespont, to send to him at Ephesus the troops that were <lb/>
            to march with him. 15. Tissaphernes, on his part, thinking <lb/>
            ...-as well because Agesilaus had no cavalry, and Caria was <lb/>
            unsuited for horse, as because he considered that he was enraged with him on account of his deceit-that he would certainly march into Caria to make an attack upon his palace <lb/>
            there, transported thither the whole of his infantry, and led <lb/>
            round his cavalry to the plain of the Mæander, supposing that <lb/>
            he was strong enough to trample down the Greeks with his <lb/>
            horse before they could reach the parts that were difficult for <lb/>
            cavalry. 16. But Agesilaus, instead of advancing towards <lb/>
            Caria, turned in the opposite direction, and proceeded straight <lb/>
            towards Phrygia; and, taking the forces that met him on the <lb/>
            march, he led them on, and reduced the towns, and, as he fell <lb/>
            upon them unexpectedly, took a vast quantity of booty. <lb/>
            17. He was thought also to have acted in this respect in <lb/>
            a manner worthy of a general, namely, that when war was <lb/>
            declared, and to deceive became from that time just and <lb/>
            right, he showed that Tissaphernes was a mere child in deceit; <lb/>
            and he was considered to have prudently enriched his friends <lb/>
            on the occasion. 18. For when everything was sold at almost <lb/>
            next to nothing, in consequence of so much booty having been <lb/>
            taken, he gave notice to his friends to buy, saying that he <lb/>
            should shortly go down to the sea, 1 taking down with him <lb/>
            his army; and he ordered those that sold the spoil to write <lb/>
            down at what price his friends bought anything, and to de- <note type="footnote">1 To some place of trade on the coast, where they might sell what they <lb/>
            had bought to advantage. Schneider, </note> <pb n="10"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[CH. 1."/><lb/>
            liver up1 the property to them; so that his friends, without <lb/>
            paying ready money for anything, or causing detriment to the <lb/>
            public treasury, all amassed large sums of money.2 19. Be­ <lb/>
            sides, when deserters, as was common, went to the king,3 and <lb/>
            offered to guide him to treasures,4 he took care that these <lb/>
            also should be captured by his friends, that they might at <lb/>
            once get money, and become more distinguished. By these <lb/>
            means, accordingly, he soon rendered many desirous of his <lb/>
            friendship.</p>
          <p>20. But being well aware that a country which has been <lb/>
            ravaged and desolated could not possibly support an army for <lb/>
            a long time, but that one which is inhabited and cultivated <lb/>
            might afford never-failing sustenance, he made it his object <lb/>
            not only to subdue his enemies by force, but to win them <lb/>
            over by mildness. 21. He often, indeed, desired his soldiers <lb/>
            not to ill-treat those whom they took prisoners, as if they <lb/>
            were dishonest characters, but to take care of themas human <lb/>
            beings ; and frequently, when he moved his camp, if he ob­ <lb/>
            served that any little children belonging to the traders, (child­ <lb/>
            ren that many used to sell,5 because they thought that they <lb/>
            should be unable to carry them about and keep them,) had <lb/>
            been left behind, he took care also of these, that they might all <lb/>
            be conveyed to some place together.6 He directed also such of <lb/>
            the prisoners as were left behind on account of their age, to <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">Προιεσθαι</foreign>.] Arbitrio permittere ; emptori res venditas tradere. Brei­ <lb/>

            take charge c f them, that they might not be destroyed by <lb/>
            dogs or wolves. So that not only those who heard of this <lb/>
            conduct, but even the very prisoners themselves, became well- <lb/>
            disposed towards him. 22. And whatever cities he gained <lb/>
            over, exempting them from such services as slaves perform for <lb/>
            their masters, he imposed upon them only such obedience as <lb/>
            the free pay to their rulers ; and some of the fortresses which <lb/>
            could not have been taken by force, he brought into subjection <lb/>
            by his humanity.</p>
          <p>23. When, however, he could not pursue his marches through <lb/>
            the plains, even in Phrygia, on account of the cavalry of <lb/>
            Pharnabazus, it became evident to him that he must raise a <lb/>
            body of cavalry, so that it might not be necessary for him to <lb/>
            carry on the war like a fugitive. 24. He therefore made a list of <lb/>
            the richest men in all the cities in those parts, to keep horses ; <lb/>
            and he gave notice that whoever should supply a horse <lb/>
            and arms, and an approved rider, should be exempted from <lb/>
            serving in person; and he thus made every one do this as <lb/>
            readily as if he were eagerly seeking for a man to die in his <lb/>
            stead. He pointed out towns also, from which it would be <lb/>
            proper to procure horsemen, thinking, that among the horse- <lb/>
            breeding towns soldiers would be raised immediately, and such <lb/>
            as most prized themselves on their equestrian skill. He was <lb/>
            considered, too, to have done this with admirable success, <lb/>
            since not only was a body of cavalry prepared for him, but <lb/>
            one that quickly became efficient and fit for service.</p>
          <p>25. As soon, then, as spring appeared, he collected all his <lb/>
            forces at Ephesus; and wishing to exercise them well, he <lb/>
            offered prizes to the troops of horse, for such as should ride <lb/>
            best, and to those of the heavy-armed infantry, for such as <lb/>
            should present their men in the best condition. To the tar­ <lb/>
            geteers and archers he also proposed prizes, for such as should <lb/>
            appear best at their respective duties. In consequence, any <lb/>
            one might have seen the places of exercise crowded with men <lb/>
            practising, and the horse-course full of horsemen riding about, <lb/>
            and javelin-men and archers aiming at marks. 26. He made, <lb/>
            indeed, the whole city, in which he was, worth seeing ; for <lb/>
            the market-place was full of all kinds of arms and horses for <lb/>
            sale, and the workers in brass, the carpenters, the black­ <lb/>
            smiths, the curriers, and decorators, 1 were all engaged in pre- <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">ΓραΦ ει̃</foreign>] Those who decorated the arms and other equipments. <lb/>

            paring arms ; so that you would have thought the city in <lb/>
            fact a workshop of war. 27. And a spectator would have <lb/>
            been cheered at seeing also Agesilaus first, and after him <lb/>
            the rest of the soldiers, crowned with chaplets whenever they <lb/>
            returned from the places of exercise, and dedicating their <lb/>
            chaplets to Diana; for wherever men reverence the gods, <lb/>
            practise warlike exercises, and observe obedience to their <lb/>
            commanders* how can it be otherwise than natural that all <lb/>
            things there should be full of good hopes ?</p>
          <p>28. Thinking, too, that contempt for their enemies might in­ <lb/>
            spire some courage for fighting, he ordered the heralds to sell <lb/>
            the barbarians, who were taken prisoners by their foraging <lb/>
            parties, in a state of partial nudity ; and the soldiers accordingly, <lb/>
            seeing that their skins were perfectly white, in consequence of <lb/>
            never stripping themselves, and that they were fat and unfit <lb/>
            for labour, from always going about in carriages, thought <lb/>
            that the war would be of no other nature than if they had to <lb/>
            fight with women. He gave notice also to his soldiers, that <lb/>
            he would immediately lead them by the shortest route to the <lb/>
            strongest parts of the country, that they might straightway <lb/>
            prepare themselves for him both in body and mind, with <lb/>
            the prospect of coming to a contest. 29. Tissaphernes, how­ <lb/>
            ever, was of opinion that he said this with the intention of <lb/>
            deceiving him again, and that he would now in reality advance <lb/>
            into Caria. He therefore sent over his infantry, as on the <lb/>
            former occasion, into Caria, and his cavalry he posted in the <lb/>
            plain of the Meander. But Agesilaus used no deceit; but, <lb/>
            as he gave out, advanced at once into the territory of Sardis, <lb/>
            and marching for three days through a part of the country free <lb/>
            from enemies, procured his army abundance of provisions. 30. On <lb/>
            the. fourth day the cavalry of the enemy appeared ; and their <lb/>
            commander told the officer in charge of the baggage to cross <lb/>
            the river Pactolus and to encamp ; the cavalry themselves, <lb/>
            seeing the men in the rear of the Greeks 2 dispersed in search <lb/>
            of plunder, slew many of them. Agesilaus, perceiving what <lb/>
            was taking place, ordered the cavalry to advance to their <lb/>
            succour ; and the Persians, on their side, when they saw <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Αὑτόθεν</foreign>.] Statim. Comp. vi. 2. 31; Memorab. ii. 8. 1; ubi vide <lb/>

            the reinforcement coming up, collected themselves together, <lb/>
            and drew up against them with the whole of their numerous <lb/>
            troops of horse. 31. Upon this, Agesilaus, knowing that the <lb/>
            enemy's infantry was not yet come up,l and that on his side <lb/>
            no part of the preparations which he had made was deficient, <lb/>
            thought it a favourable opportunity to come to a battle, if he <lb/>
            found it possible. After having sacrificed, therefore, he im­ <lb/>
            mediately led his main body against the cavalry arrayed <lb/>
            in front of him, and ordered those of the heavy-armed men who <lb/>
            were past twenty-seven years of age,2 to hurry forward at <lb/>
            the same time with them, and told the targeteers also to ad­ <lb/>
            vance running. He then ordered the cavalry also to charge, <lb/>
            as he and all the rest of the army would follow close upon <lb/>
            them. 32. The bravest of the Persians, indeed, stood the <lb/>
            charge of the cavalry ; but when every species of danger <lb/>
            menaced them at the same time, they gave way ; and some of <lb/>
            them immediately met their fate in the river,3 while the rest <lb/>
            fled. The Greeks pursue and take their very camp ; and <lb/>
            the targeteers, as was to be expected, betook themselves to <lb/>
            plundering ; while Agesilaus, taking possession of all the <lb/>
            neighbouring parts, both friendly and hostile, extended his <lb/>
            camp round about.4</p>
          <p>33. But when he heard that the enemy were thrown into <lb/>
            disorder in consequence of blaming one another for what had <lb/>
            happened, he immediately led his army against Sardis. There <lb/>
            he at the same time burned and ravaged the lands around the <lb/>

            however, he afterwards proceeded fearlessly, seeing the <lb/>
            Greeks, who were before compelled to worship the Persians, <lb/>
            honoured by those by whom they had been insulted; and <lb/>
            having made those who thought themselves worthy to en­ <lb/>
            joy the honours paid to the gods unable to look in the face of <lb/>
            the Greeks ; securing the territory of his friends, also, from <lb/>
            being ravaged, and reaping such fruits from the territory of <lb/>
            his enemies, that in two years he made an offering to the god <lb/>
            at Delphi of a tenth part of the spoil, to the amount of more | <lb/>
            than a hundred talents.</p>
          <p>35. The king of the Persians, however, thinking that Tis­ <lb/>
            saphernes was the cause of his affairs being in an ill state, sent <lb/>
            down Tithraustes, and had his head cut off.</p>
          <p>After this the condition of the barbarians grew more de­ <lb/>
            pressed, whilst that of Agesilaus became stronger ; for em­ <lb/>
            bassies came to him from all nations to solicit his friendship, <lb/>
            and many, eager for freedom, revolted to him ; so that Age­ <lb/>
            silaus was no longer leader of the Greeks only, but also of <lb/>
            many barbarians. 36. It is but right, also, to feel extraordin­ <lb/>
            ary admiration for him for this reason, that he who was ruler <lb/>
            of several states on the continent, and ruler also of the islands, <lb/>
            since his country put the fleet too into his hands, and who was <lb/>
            exalted both in reputation and power, having the privilege <lb/>
            moreover of availing himself of many and excellent advantages <lb/>
            Cor whatever object he desired, and, in addition to this, enter­ <lb/>
            taining, what was the greatest of all, the design and the hope <lb/>
            of overthrowing the empire which had before invaded Greece, <lb/>
            was nevertheless overcome by none of these distinctions, but, <lb/>
            when a despatch came to him from the authorities at home, <lb/>
            calling on him to come to the support of his country, he obeyed <lb/>
            the orders from the state with no less readiness than if he had <lb/>
            been standing alone in the court of the Ephori before the five ;1 <lb/>
            making it quite evident that he would not receive even the <lb/>
            whole earth in exchange for his country, or newly acquired <lb/>
            friends in the place of his old ones, or advantages that were <lb/>

            were honourable and just, even though attended with danger. <lb/>
            37. As long, however, as he continued in authority, did he not <lb/>
            exhibit also the following part of his conduct as that of a king <lb/>
            worthy of praise ? for, having found all the states to which he <lb/>
            sailed to take the government of them, divided into factions, <lb/>
            on account of their constitutions having been disturbed when <lb/>
            the Athenians ceased to rule,1 he made those states, as long as <lb/>
            he himself was present, continue to be governed with unani­ <lb/>
            mity and prosperity, without having occasion to resort to the <lb/>
            punishment of exile or death. 38. The Greeks in Asia, there­ <lb/>
            fore, grieved for him when he departed, not merely as a com­ <lb/>
            mander, but as a father and a friend ; and they showed in the <lb/>
            end that they offered no feigned friendship ; at least they <lb/>
            voluntarily joined in rendering him assistance on behalf of <lb/>
            Lacedæmon; and that, too, though, they were aware that they <lb/>
            would have to fight with men not inferior to themselves. Such, <lb/>
            then, was the conclusion of his acts in Asia.</p>

          <p>Agesilaus crosses the Hellespont, and is assailed, after marching through <lb/>
            Thrace and Macedonia, by the Thessalians and other allies of the The­ <lb/>
            bans, but puts them to flight. He defeats the Thebans and their sup­ <lb/>
            porters at Coroneia, and returns to Sparta. He undertakes another expedi­ <lb/>
            tion, and captures the harbour of Corinth. He defeats the Acarnanians <lb/>
            He reinstates those who had been exiled from Phlius. He twice lays <lb/>
            waste Bœotia, and, after the battle of Leuctra, takes vengeance on the <lb/>
            people of Tegea, and defends his country against the whole force of the <lb/>
            Boeotians. At an advanced age he acts as an ambassador for his country­ <lb/>
            men. But even when he is eighty years old, he undertakes an expedition <lb/>
            into Egypt, to assist Tachus, who had invited him thither. Being de­ <lb/>
            ceived by Tachus, he deserts him, supports Nectanebus against his rival <lb/>
            Mendesius, and places him on the throne. He returns home with in <lb/>
            creased reputation and wealth.</p>
          <p>l. HAVING crossed over the Hellespont, he marched through <lb/>

            marcL2d with his vast army; and the march which the bar­ <lb/>
            barian took a year to accomplish, Agesilaus performed in less <lb/>
            than a month ; for he was extremely anxious not to be too <lb/>
            late to give assistance to his country. 2. But when, after <lb/>
            passing through Macedonia, he came to Thessaly, the Laris­ <lb/>
            sæans, Cranonians, Scotussæans, and Pharsalians, being allies <lb/>
            of the Bœotians, and all the Thessalians, indeed, except such <lb/>
            as happened to be then in exile,1 pursued and harassed him. <lb/>
            For a time he led his army in an oblong form, with half of <lb/>
            his cavalry in the van, and the other half in the rear. But <lb/>
            when the Thessalians, by continually assailing the hindmost, <lb/>
            retarded his march, he despatches to the rear also the cavalry <lb/>
            from the front, except those immediately about himself.2 <lb/>
            3. But when they drew up face to face with each other in <lb/>
            battle-array, the Thessalians, thinking that they were not on <lb/>
            fit ground for charging with cavalry against heavy-armed in­ <lb/>
            fantry, wheeled about, and slowly retreated; and the troops <lb/>
            of Agesilaus followed them at a very moderate pace.3 But <lb/>
            Agesilaus, perceiving the mistake which both parties were <lb/>
            committing, sends off the cavalry that he had about him, a <lb/>
            very efficient body of men, and orders them to tell the others <lb/>
            to pursue, and to pursue also themselves at their utmost speed, <lb/>
            and not to allow the enemy again an opportunity of facing <lb/>
            about. But when the Thessalians saw them thus unexpectedly <lb/>
            advancing, some of them did not even wheel round, and <lb/>
            others, as they were endeavouring to face about, were taken <lb/>
            prisoners in the very act of turning their horses round.4 <lb/>
            4. Polycharmus, however, the commander of the Pharsalian <lb/>

            about him. When this happened, a disastrous flight1 took <lb/>
            place, so that some of the enemy were killed, and others taken <lb/>
            prisoners; and they accordingly did not halt till they arrived <lb/>
            at Mount Narthacium. 5. And then indeed Agesilaus set up <lb/>
            a trophy between Eras and Narthacium,2 and halted there, <lb/>
            greatly delighted at his exploit, in having defeated with ca­ <lb/>
            valry which he himself had formed, a people who prided them­ <lb/>
            selves on their skill in horsemanship. Next day, crossing the <lb/>
            Achæan mountains3 of Phthia, he proceeded during the rest of <lb/>
            his march through a friendly district, till he came to the con­ <lb/>
            fines of the Bœotians.</p>
          <p>6. Here having found the Thebans, Athenians, Argives, <lb/>
            Corinthians, Ænianes,4 Eubœans, and both the Locrians,5 drawn <lb/>
            up in array against him, he did not make any delay, but openly <lb/>
            drew up his forces to oppose them, having, of the Lacedæmon­ <lb/>
            ians, indeed, a mora and a half, but of the allies from the <lb/>
            neighbouring districts 7 only the Phocians and Orchomenians, <lb/>
            and the rest of the force which he led himself. 7. And I am not <lb/>
            going to say this, that though he had much less numerous and <lb/>
            inferior forces, he nevertheless engaged ; for, if I should say <lb/>
            so, I think that I should prove Agesilaus to be mad, and my­ <lb/>
            self foolish, by praising a man who rashly incurred danger in <lb/>
            matters of the greatest moment. But I the more admire this <lb/>
            action of his, that he both prepared a force which was not <lb/>
            less numerous than that of the enemy, and armed them in <lb/>
            such a manner that they appeared wholly covered with brass <lb/>
            and purple. 8. He made it his care also that the soldiers <lb/>
            should be able to endure toils. He inspired their minds, too, <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">φυγὴ ἐξαισία</foreign>.] <foreign xml:lang="grc">᾽Εξαισίος</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξ</foreign> and aloa, fatum) signifies properly be­ <lb/>

            with such courage, that they were in a condition to fight <lb/>
            against whomsoever it might be requisite ;1 and he animated <lb/>
            those about him with emulation of one another in order that <lb/>
            each of them might strive to show himself the best. He filled <lb/>
            all likewise with hopes that they would all secure many ad­ <lb/>
            vantages, if they proved themselves brave men ; thinking <lb/>
            that from such motives 2 men would fight most eagerly <lb/>
            against their enemies ; nor indeed was he deceived.</p>
          <p>9. But I will give a detailed account of the battle ; for it <lb/>
            was such as no other of the battles in our days; since there <lb/>
            came together at the plain of Coroneia, Agesilaus and his troops <lb/>
            on the side of the Cephisus, and the Thebans and their allies <lb/>
            on the side of Mount Helicon ; and they saw that the troops <lb/>
            on each side were very equally matched ; and the cavalry also <lb/>
            of both parties were nearly alike in number. Agesilaus led the <lb/>
            right wing of his own army, and the Orchomenians were posted <lb/>
            at the extremity of his left; on the other side, the Thebans <lb/>
            themselves were on the right wing, and the Argives formed <lb/>
            their left. 10. Whilst they were advancing to the charge, <lb/>
            there was for some time deep silence on both sides ; but <lb/>
            when they were distant from one another about a stadium, <lb/>
            the Thebans raised the war-shout and advanced to the charge <lb/>
            at a running pace ; and, when there was but half a stadium be­ <lb/>
            tween them, the mercenary troops that Herippidas commanded <lb/>
            rushed forth from the main body of Agesilaus to charge the <lb/>
            enemy, 11. These troops consisted of those who had marched <lb/>
            with him from home, some from the army of Cyrus, and the <lb/>
            rest Ionians and Æolians, and the Hellespontines bordering on <lb/>
            them. 3 All these rushed in a mass to the charge, and, at­ <lb/>
            tacking the enemy at the point of the spear, routed all that <lb/>
            was opposed to them. The Argives, however, did not wait <lb/>
            for the charge of Agesilaus and his troops, but fled towards <lb/>
            Helicon. Here some of the mercenaries were proceeding <lb/>
            to crown Agesilaus as conqueror, but some one brought him <lb/>
            word that the Thebans, having cut their way through the <note type="footnote"> 1 Quin et animos eorwn tantâ impleverat elatione, ut ad pugnandum <lb/>

            Orchomenians, were among the baggage, when he immediately <lb/>
            drew out his main body in line and led it against them ; but <lb/>
            the Thebans on their side, when they caught sight of their <lb/>
            allies who had fled towards Helicon, were desirous to make a <lb/>
            way through the enemy to join their friends, and began to <lb/>
            march forward with great spirit. 12. On this occasion we <lb/>
            may say, without dispute, that Agesilaus proved himself a <lb/>
            brave man ; yet he did not choose the safest mode of proceed­ <lb/>
            ing ; for when he might have let those who were trying to <lb/>
            escape pass by him, and then have pursued and harassed their <lb/>
            rear, he did not adopt that course, but closed with the The­ <lb/>
            bans full in front; and both parties, clashing their shields to­ <lb/>
            gether, alternately gave way and resisted, slew and were slain. <lb/>
            There was no outcry, however, nor was there altogether <lb/>
            silence, but such a sound as rage and strife would produce. <lb/>
            At length part of the Thebans made a way through the enemy <lb/>
            to Mount Helicon, but a great number of them were cut off in <lb/>
            their retreat. 13. But when the victory was fairly in the <lb/>
            hands of Agesilaus, and he himself was brought in wounded <lb/>
            to the main body, some of the cavalry rode up and told him <lb/>
            that eighty of the enemy were in arms under shelter of the <lb/>
            temple,1 and asked him how they ought to act with regard to <lb/>
            them ; but he, although he had many wounds all over his body, <lb/>
            and from every kind of weapon, was nevertheless not unmind­ <lb/>
            ful of the obligations of religion, but gave orders to let them <lb/>
            depart whithersoever they pleased, and forbade his men to do <lb/>
            them any injury; he also directed the horse-soldiers that were <lb/>
            about him to escort them until they reached a place of safety.</p>
          <p>14. But when the fight was over, a spectator might have <lb/>
            seen, where they engaged with one another, the ground <lb/>
            crimsoned with blood, the dead bodies of friends and enemies <lb/>
            lying close to one another, shields broken to pieces, spears <lb/>

              men should wear chaplets in honour of the god,2 and that all <lb/>
              the flute-players should play on their instruments. 16. These <lb/>
              orders they executed ; and the Thebans sent a herald, desir­ <lb/>

              truce was accordingly made, and Agesilaus commenced his <lb/>
              march homewards, choosing, instead of being the most power­ <lb/>

            narrow passes4 to Corinth, and makes himself master of the <lb/>
            walls, which stretched as far as Lechæum. Having thus opened <lb/>

            issuing from Creusis 2 by this way, easily united themselves <lb/>

            marched off, after dinner, towards the city, as if he thought <lb/>

            Thebans as were in exile on account of having favoured the <lb/>

            Phliasians as were in exile for the sake of the Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            taking the field in person against Phlius.2 22. If any one cen­ <lb/>
            sures him for these proceedings on any other account,3 it is yet <lb/>
            quite evident that they sprung from motives of friendship ; for <lb/>
            when the enemy had put to death such of the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            as were in Thebes,4 he marched against Thebes to their re­ <lb/>
            lief ; but finding every place fortified with trenches and ram­ <lb/>
            parts, he crossed over the heights of Cynoscephalæ, and laid <lb/>
            waste the lands as far as the city, giving the Thebans an op­ <lb/>
            portunity of fighting if they wished, both in the plains and on <lb/>
            the hills. In the following year also he marched a second <lb/>
            time against Thebes, and crossing the ramparts and trenches <lb/>
            at Scolus,5 laid waste the rest of Boeotia.</p>
          <p>23. Down to this time both he himself and the state were <lb/>
            fortunate in common. Whatever failures, however, occurred <lb/>
            afterwards, no one can say that they happened under the <lb/>
            generalship of Agesilaus.6 But after that the disaster at <lb/>
            Leuctrahad taken place, when the enemy, in conjunction with <lb/>
            the Mantinæans, were putting to death his friends and allies in <lb/>

            mon,1 and with them the Phocians and both the Locrians,2 as <lb/>
            well as the Thessalians, Ænianes, Acarnanians, and Euboeans, <lb/>
            and when, in addition to this, the slaves and many of the <lb/>
            neighbouring cities had revolted, while no less a number of <lb/>
            the Spartans themselves had been killed in the battle at <lb/>
            Leuctra than had survived, he nevertheless preserved the <lb/>
            city, even though it was without walls, not leading out <lb/>
            his troops to a place where the enemy would in every way <lb/>
            have had the advantage, but drawing them up strongly where <lb/>
            his countrymen would be likely to have the superiority, think­ <lb/>
            in-, that if he were to go out to the open plains, he would be <lb/>
            surrounded on all sides, but that, remaining in confined and <lb/>
            elevated spots, he would be in every way superior. 25. When, <lb/>
            again, the army of the enemy withdrew, how can any one say <lb/>
            that he conducted himself otherwise than prudently ? For <lb/>
            when old age prevented him from serving either on foot or on <lb/>
            horseback, and he saw that his country needed funds if it <lb/>
            intended to have any ally, he devoted himself to the task of <lb/>
            supplying it with funds; whatever he could do while remain­ <lb/>
            ing at home, he contrived to accomplish ; and he did not <lb/>
            shrink from going from home on whatever business the <lb/>
            exigencies of the time required, nor was he ashamed, when he <lb/>
            seemed likely to benefit his country, to go out as an ambassa­ <lb/>

          <p>26. Yet even in his embassy he performed the actions of a <lb/>
            great general; for Autophradates,3 who was besieging Ario­ <lb/>
            barzanes, an ally of Agesilaus, in Assus,4 betook himself, <lb/>
            through fear of Agesilaus, to flight; and Cotys, too, who was <note type="footnote">1 This was the first expedition of Epaminondas into the Peloponnesus, <lb/>

            too, when he was besieging both these places by sea with a <lb/>
            hundred vessels, sailed off home, not like the others,1 through <lb/>
            fear, but from being persuaded by Agesilaus. 27. He here <lb/>
            indeed performed actions truly worthy of admiration; 2 for <lb/>
            both those who thought that they had been benefited by him, <lb/>
            and those who had fled before him, gave him money; while <lb/>
            Tachus and Mausolus (who had also contributed money to <lb/>
            Lacedæmon on account of his former friendship with Agesi­ <lb/>
            laus) sent him h ome with a magnificent escort.</p>
          <p>28. He was now about eighty years old ; but having learned <lb/>
            that the king of the Egyptians 3 was anxious to go to war with <lb/>
            the king of Persia, and had a vast army of infantry and ca­ <lb/>
            valry, and abundant resources, he heard with pleasure that he <lb/>
            had sent for him, promising also to make him general; 29. for <lb/>
            he designed in the same expedition to repay the Egyptian <lb/>
            for the benefits which he had conferred on Lacedæmon,4 <lb/>
            to liberate a second time the Greeks in Asia, and to take <lb/>
            vengeance on the Persian, both for what he had done before, <lb/>
            and because that now, while saying that he was their ally, he <lb/>
            ordered them to relinquish Messene.5 30. But when the <lb/>
            king who had sent for him did not give him the generalship, <lb/>
            Agesilaus, as having been greatly deceived, considered what <note type="footnote"> Paphlagonia, Mausolus of Caria. Breitenbach. Ariobarzanes was an ally <lb/>

            he ought to do. Soon after, however, the Egyptians, who <lb/>
            were serving apart, 1 revolted from the king, being the first <lb/>
            to do so; and then all the rest deserted him; and Tachus <lb/>
            himself, in alarm, fled to Sidon in Phoenicia ; while the Egyp­ <lb/>
            tians, splitting into factions, elected two kings.2 31. Upon <lb/>
            this Agesilaus, knowing that if he should join neither party, <lb/>
            neither would furnish pay for the Grecian soldiers, nor would <lb/>
            either offer him provisions for sale, while whichsoever proved <lb/>
            victorious would be his enemy, but that if he should join one <lb/>
            of the two, that one at least, receiving assistance from him, <lb/>
            would, as was probable, be his friend, and having accordingly <lb/>
            formed his opinion as to which of the two seemed best dis­ <lb/>
            posed towards the Greeks, took the field with him, and <lb/>
            defeating in battle the one that was hostile to the Greeks, <lb/>
            utterly reduced him; the other he assisted in establishing on <lb/>

          <p>1. THE actions of Agesilaus which have been mentioned were <lb/>
            such as were done before many witnesses of his conduct. Such <lb/>
            acts, indeed, do not require proofs ; it is sufficient merely to <lb/>
            recall them to the memory, and they are at once credited. <lb/>
            But now I will endeavour to set forth the virtue that was in <lb/>
            his mind, under the influence of which he did these things, <lb/>
            and loved everything that was good, and repelled every­ <lb/>

            to what was divine, that even his enemies considered his <lb/>
            oaths and compacts more worthy of trust than the friendship <lb/>
            existing among themselves; [since in making covenants <lb/>
            among themselves], 1 they were afraid to meet one another, but <lb/>
            they put themselves wholly into the hands of Agesilaus ; and <lb/>
            that no one may disbelieve me. I shall mention the most re­ <lb/>
            markable among those who did so.</p>
          <p>3. Spithridates the Persian, knowing that Pharnabazus was <lb/>
            intriguing to marry the daughter of the king, but wished to <lb/>
            take his own daughter without marrying her, and considering <lb/>
            this an insult, placed himself, his wife, his children, and his <lb/>
            troops,2 in the hands of Agesilaus 4. Cotys,3 too, the satrap <lb/>
            of the Paphlagonians, would not comply with the wishes of <lb/>
            the king, though he sent him his pledge of the right hand, <lb/>
            fearing lest he should be made prisoner, and either have to <lb/>
            pay a large sum of money for his ransom, or be put to death ; <lb/>
            yet he, trusting to a treaty with Agesilaus, not only came to <lb/>
            his camp, but, forming an alliance with Agesilaus, preferred to <lb/>
            take the field with him, with a thousand horse, and two thou­ <lb/>
            sand targeteers. 5. Pharnabazus4 also came to a conference <lb/>
            with Agesilaus, and stated freely in their conversation that, <lb/>
            unless he himself was appointed commander of the whole Per­ <lb/>
            sian army, he would revolt from the king. "If, however," <lb/>
            says he, " I am made commander, I will fight with thee, 0 <lb/>
            Agesilaus, as vigorously as I may be able." In saying this, <lb/>
            he felt convinced that he should suffer nothing contrary to <lb/>
            the terms of the truce. So important and honourable a <lb/>
            quality is it in all other men, and especially in a commander, <lb/>
            to be honest and trustworthy, and to be known to be so. Such <lb/>
            observations I had to make with respect to his piety. <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Οἱ συντιθέμενοι ἀλλήλοις</foreign>.] These words are inserted by Breitenbach <lb/>

          <p>Of the integrity shown by Agesilaus as a private individual, as a king, and <lb/>
            as a general. Two examples of it.</p>
          <p>1. OF his integrity in regard to money also, what greater <lb/>
            proofs can any one have than the following ? For no one <lb/>
            ever complained 1 that he was despoiled of anything by Age <lb/>
            silaus; but many acknowledged that they had received many <lb/>
            acts of kindness from him. How could a man, indeed, to <lb/>
            whom it is a pleasure to give his own property away for the <lb/>
            benefit of mankind, wish to deprive others of their property, <lb/>
            in order merely to incur ill repute? If he desired money, it <lb/>
            would be far less troublesome to him to keep his own than to <lb/>
            take what did not belong to him. 2. Or how could a man <lb/>
            who would not even withhold favours, for which there are no <lb/>
            actions at law against him who withholds them, wish to take <lb/>
            away from others even what the law forbids ? But Agesilaus <lb/>
            not only considered that not to return favours was unjust, but <lb/>
            even that not to return them in greater measure, if the recipi­ <lb/>
            ent were able, was unjust. 3. Or how could any one fairly <lb/>
            accuse him of embezzling the finances of the state, who made <lb/>
            over to his country, for its benefit, the presents intended for <lb/>
            himself? Or is it not also a great proof of self-command in <lb/>
            regard to money, that whenever he wished to benefit the state <lb/>
            or his friends by pecuniary gifts, he was able to assist them <lb/>
            by obtaining contributions from others ?2 4. For if he had <lb/>
            been in the habit of selling his favours, or of doing good for <lb/>
            '.lie sake of reward, no one would have considered that he <lb/>
            wed anything to him; but those who have received benefits <lb/>
            gratuitously, always gladly serve their benefactor, both be­ <lb/>
            cause they have received favours and because they have been <note type="footnote"> <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ενεκάλεσεν</foreign>.] The verb <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐγκαλει̃ν</foreign>, without a dative of the person, i. e. <lb/>

            trusted at first as being worthy to keep a deposit of gratitude.1 <lb/>
            5. Or must he not have quite shrunk from disgraceful <lb/>
            gains, who preferred having a little with honour to having <lb/>
            more with injustice ? Agesilaus, then, being pronounced by the <lb/>
            state to be entitled to all the property of Agis, transferred the <lb/>
            half of it to his relatives on the mother's side,- because he saw <lb/>
            that they were in want. That this account is true, the whole <lb/>
            community of the Lacedæmonians is a witness. 6. When <lb/>
            Tithraustes,2 too, offered him a vast number of presents, if he <lb/>
            would retire from his province, Agesilaus replied, "It is an <lb/>
            opinion among us, Tithraustes, that it is more honourable for <lb/>
            a commander to enrich his army than himself, and to endeavour <lb/>
            to gain spoils from his enemies rather than presents."</p>

            immoderate eating as from utter indolence ?3 Accordingly, <lb/>
            when he received a double portion4 at the public meals, he <lb/>
            not only did not consume both portions, but, distributing them <lb/>
            around, left neither for himself; considering that this double <lb/>
            portion was given to him as king, not for the purpose of in­ <lb/>
            dulging his appetite, but that he might be able to honour with <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Παρακαταθήκην χάριτος</foreign>.] Favours are said to be deposited with <lb/>

            it whomsoever he pleased. 2. He had recourse to sleep, n It <lb/>
            as to a master, but as to that which was under the control of <lb/>
            circumstances ; and unless he had the worst couch of all the <lb/>
            people that were with him, he gave manifest indications of <lb/>
            shame ; for he thought that it became a prince to surpass <lb/>
            private persons, not in effeminacy, but in endurance. 3. He <lb/>
            was not, however, ashamed of having a greater share of heat <lb/>
            in the summer and of cold in the winter. If it ever hap­ <lb/>
            pened, also, to his army to endure hardships, he willingly <lb/>
            toiled more than others; thinking that all such exertions <lb/>
            were a solace to his soldiers. To say all in a word, Agesilaus <lb/>
            took delight in toil, but allowed indolence no influence over <lb/>
            him.</p>
          <p>4. As to his continence in matters of love, is it not right to <lb/>
            mention it, if for no other reason, yet for the wonder of it ? <lb/>
            To abstain, indeed, from that which one does not desire, any <lb/>
            one would say was agreeable to human nature ; but that being <lb/>
            enamoured of Megabates,1 the son of Spithridates, as a most <lb/>
            ardent temperament would be enamoured of a most beautiful <lb/>
            object, he should, when (as it was a custom among the Per­ <lb/>
            sians to kiss those whom they esteem) Megabates attempted <lb/>
            to kiss Agesilaus, have striven with all his might to prevent <lb/>
            himself from being kissed by him, is not this an instance of con­ <lb/>
            tinence even of the most noble kind?2</p>
          <p>5. But when Megabates no longer attempted to kiss him, <lb/>
            as if thinking himself to be dishonoured, Agesilaus gave in­ <lb/>
            structions to one of his companions to persuade Megabates to <lb/>
            honour him again. But as his companion asked him, whether, <lb/>
            if Megabates could be persuaded, he would kiss him, Agesi­ <lb/>
            laus accordingly, after keeping silence a long time, spoke <lb/>
            thus: " Not even if I were immediately to become the most <lb/>

            some people think concerning these matters ;2 I am indeed <lb/>
            well aware that far more men can conquer their enemies than <lb/>
            can control passions of such a nature; and if but few knew <lb/>
            these things, it would be very well for many to disbelieve <lb/>
            them ; but we all know that the most illustrious of men least <lb/>
            escape notice in what they do. But no man has ever said <lb/>
            that he saw Agesilaus indulging in anything of this sort, nor, <lb/>
            if he had asserted it on conjecture, would he have been thought <lb/>
            to say what was worthy of credit. 7. For he took up his abode <lb/>
            in no house by himself, when away from home, but was always <lb/>
            in some templet where it is impossible to do things of this <lb/>
            kind, or before the public, making the eyes of all men wit­ <lb/>
            nesses of his continence. But if I speak falsely as to these <lb/>
            things, Greece knowing the contrary, I abstain from all praise <lb/>
            of Agesilaus, and take blame to myself.</p>

            effects of it on those who were concerned with him.</p>
          <p>1. OF his valour also he appears to me to have exhibited <lb/>
            proofs by no means obscure, undertaking always to carry on <lb/>
            war with the most powerful of the enemies both of his country <lb/>
            and of Greece, and placing himself first in the contests against <lb/>
            them. 2. Wherever the enemy wished to engage with him in <lb/>
            battle, he did not secure the victory by making them flee with <lb/>
            terror, but raised a trophy by defeating them in a fairly fought <lb/>
            field,4 leaving immortal monuments of his valour, and bearing <note type="footnote"> 1 In allusion to the fable of Midas. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Kai <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὃτι μὲν δὴ λαμάνουσί τινες ταυ̃τα</foreign>.] Atque non ignoro equidem <lb/>

            off with him plain proofs I that he had f ought with spirit ; so <lb/>
            that men might form an opinion of his courage, not from hearing <lb/>
            of it, but by witnessing it. 3. It is right therefore to consider <lb/>
            that the trophies of Agesilaus were not merely such as he actually <lb/>
            raised, but whatever campaigns he commanded in ; for he did <lb/>
            not the less gain a victory because his enemies were unwilling <lb/>
            to fight with him, but gained it with less danger and more <lb/>
            advantage both to the state and to the allies; and even in the <lb/>
            public games they crown those who obtain a victory without <lb/>
            a contest, no less than those who gain it by fighting.</p>
          <p>4. As to his wisdom, again, what actions of his do not dis­ <lb/>
            play it ? when he so conducted himself towards his country, <lb/>
            that, obeying it to the utmost,2 .... and being zealous for the <lb/>
            interests of those associated with him, he acquired friends <lb/>
            who never made excuses for not serving him, and rendered <lb/>
            his soldiers also obedient and attached to him. How indeed <lb/>
            can a battalion become more strong than by being well <lb/>
            disciplined through obeying orders, and by supporting their <lb/>
            general faithfully through attachment to his person ? 5. He had <lb/>
            enemies, it is true, who, though they could not find fault with <lb/>
            him, yet felt obliged to hate him ; for he was always contriv­ <lb/>
            ing means that his allies might have the advantage over them, <lb/>
            deceiving when there was an opportunity, anticipating when <lb/>
            expedition was necessary, and concealing his movements from <lb/>
            them when it was advantageous to do so, and pursuing towards <lb/>
            his enemies a quite contrary course of conduct to that which <lb/>
            he adopted towards his friends. 6. He used night as day, and <lb/>
            day as night, often rendering it uncertain both where he was, <lb/>
            and whither he was going, and what he intended to do ; so <lb/>
            that he made even strong places unsafe for his enemies; <lb/>
            sometimes avoiding them, sometimes outstripping them, some <lb/>
            times surprising them. 7. When. he was on the march, how­ <lb/>
            ever, and knew that the enemy had the liberty of fighting if <lb/>
            they wished, he led his army drawn up in such order that he <lb/>

            the least possible exposure to alarm or confusion, as well as the <lb/>
            greatest security against mistakes and ambuscades. 8. While <lb/>
            acting thus, therefore, he was an object of terror to his enemies, <lb/>
            but inspired courage and confidence into his friends; so that <lb/>
            he continued uncontemned by his adversaries, uncensured by <lb/>
            his fellow citizens, approved by- his friends, and extremely <lb/>
            beloved and commended by all mankind.</p>

          <p>Patriotism of Agesilaus. His obedience to the laws of Sparta, and paternal <lb/>

            hostility to Persia.</p>

            show by every particular proof; for I think, indeed, that there <lb/>
            was nothing of all that was done by him, that did not tend to the <lb/>
            service of it. But to speak briefly, we all know that Agesilaus, <lb/>

            shrink from toils, or stand aloof from dangers, or spare money, <lb/>
            or make his person or old age an excuse for inaction ; but he <lb/>
            considered it the duty of a good king to do as much good as <lb/>
            possible to his subjects. 2. I account this also among his <lb/>
            greatest services to his country, that while he was the most <lb/>
            powerful man in the state, he proved himself the most obedient <lb/>
            to the laws; for who would be inclined to disobey the laws, <lb/>
            when he saw the king obeying them ? Or who, from thinking <lb/>
            himself in too humble a condition, would attempt to raise a <lb/>
            revolution, when he saw the king enduring even to be coin­ <lb/>
            manded in compliance with the laws. 3. He even conducted <lb/>
            himself towards those who differed from him in political <lb/>
            affairs, as a father towards his children ; for he reproved them <lb/>
            for their faults, but honoured them if they did anything <lb/>
            praiseworthy, and steed by then if any calamity happened to <note type="footnote"> 1 Compare c. 2, sect. 3, Also De Rep. Lac. c. 3, sect. 5. </note> <pb n="33"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="§ 4 -]"/> <lb/>
            them ; regarding no one of his countrymen as an enemy, but <lb/>
            wishing to commend all; thinking it a gain that all should be <lb/>
            preserved, and esteeming it as a loss, if any one, though worth <lb/>
            but little, was cut off; but if they observed a quiet adherence <lb/>
            to the laws, he evidently thought that his country would always <lb/>
            be happy, and that when the Greeks conducted themselves <lb/>
            wisely, it would be strong. 4. If, moreover, it is honourable <lb/>
            that one who is a Greek should be a lover of the Greeks, what <lb/>
            other commander has any one seen, either showing reluctance to <lb/>
            take a city, when he thought he could plunder it, or regarding <lb/>
            a victory, in a war with the Greeks, as a calamity ? 5. But <lb/>
            Agesilaus, when news was brought him that in the battle at <lb/>
            Corinth I eight Lacedæmonians, and nearly ten thousand of the <lb/>
            enemy, were killed, showed himself by no means delighted, but <lb/>
            exclaimed, "Alas for Greece ! since those who have now died <lb/>
            would be able, if living, to defeat all the barbarians in the <lb/>
            field of battle." 2 6. But when the Corinthian exiles said <lb/>
            that the city would be surrendered to them, and showed him the <lb/>
            machines with which they all expected to take the walls, he re­ <lb/>
            fused to make an attack upon it, saying, that it was proper to re­ <lb/>
            duce the cities of Greece, not to slavery, but to their senses. <lb/>
            But if," added he," we cut off all that do wrong from among us, <lb/>
            we must take care lest we have none left to conquer the barba­ <lb/>
            rians." 3 7. If. again, it is honourable to be a bater of the Per­ <lb/>
            sians, because their former king led out an army for the purpose <lb/>
            of enslaving Greece, and the present king 4 forms alliances with <lb/>
            those by whose assistance he thinks that he shall do it greater <lb/>
            injury, sends presents to those whom he thinks likely, on <lb/>
            receiving them, to inflict the most harm on the Greeks, and <lb/>
            assists in making any peace through which be thinks that we <lb/>
            shall most be led to war with one another,-all men, indeed, <lb/>
            see this,—but what other person, except Agesilaus, ever made <lb/>
            it his care, either that any nation should revolt from the <lb/>
            Persian king, or that one which had revolted should not be cut <lb/>
            off, or, in general, that the king of Persia, though suffering <lb/>
            calamities himself, should not he able to cause annoyance <lb/>
            to the Greeks? Agesilaus, even when his country was at war <note type="footnote"> I Xen. Hellen. iv. 2. 9—23. </note><note type="footnote">2 C. Nep.

            with the Greeks, nevertheless did not neglect the common <lb/>

          <p>Modesty, affability, and cheerfulness of Agesilaus, which rendered his <lb/>
            society agreeable to those around him. His kingly spirit, and contempt <lb/>
            of the riches and ostentation of the Persians.</p>
          <p>1. IT is proper, also, not to omit to notice his sweetness of <lb/>
            temper; since while honour was conferred on him, and <lb/>
            power attended him, (and, in addition to these, the dignity of a <lb/>
            throne, a throne which was not assailed by conspiracies, but <lb/>
            regarded with acquiescence,) no one could ever see any signs of <lb/>
            haughtiness in him, but could perceive, even without looking <lb/>
            for it, a disposition to love and serve his friends. 2. He took <lb/>
            a share, too, with the greatest pleasure, in sportive conversa­ <lb/>
            tion,1 but he discoursed seriously with his friends 2 on what­ <lb/>
            ever subject it was necessary to do so. As he was full of <lb/>
            hope and good spirits, and always cheerful, he caused many to <lb/>
            seek his society, not merely for the sake of effecting some ob­ <lb/>
            ject by his means, but also for the sake of spending the day <lb/>
            pleasantly. Though he was by no means of a temper for <lb/>
            boasting, he nevertheless listened without displeasure to those <lb/>
            who praised themselves, thinking that they did no harm, but <lb/>
            bade fair to become deserving men.</p>
          <p>3. I must not omit to observe, however, how aptly, on one <note type="footnote"> <foreign xml:lang="grc">Παιδικω̃ν λόγων</foreign>. ] The love of youths at Sparta is well known, and was <lb/>
            most honourable; for those who were enamoured strove to do the greatest <lb/>
            service and pleasure to the beloved object, as is said by Plutarch, Lye. c. <lb/>
            20, who alsc relates that Agesilaus was thus beloved by Lysander, Ages. c. <lb/>

            pleasant discourse, such as might occur between any two friends, is meant, <lb/>

            occasion, he displayed his magnanimity; for when a letter <lb/>
            reached him from the king of Persia, (which the Persian who <lb/>
            was with Callias 1 the Lacedæmonian brought,) about forming <lb/>
            a connexion of hospitality and friendship with him, he would not <lb/>
            receive it, but desired him who brought it to tell the king, that <lb/>
            it was by no means requisite to send letters to him individu­ <lb/>
            ally, but that if he showed himself a friend to Laceda?mon <lb/>
            and well disposed towards Greece, he would himself become <lb/>
            his friend to the utmost of his power; " if, however," added <lb/>
            he, " he is found forming designs against it, let him not think, <lb/>
            even if I receive a great number of letters from him, that he <lb/>
            will have me for a friend." 4. I accordingly commend this con­ <lb/>
            duct of Agesilaus, that, to gratify the Greeks, he rejected the <lb/>
            friendship of the king. I admire also this feeling in him, <lb/>
            that he did not think that that sovereign of the two who had <lb/>
            the greater riches, and ruled over the greater number of men, <lb/>
            ought to think more highly of himself, but whichsoever was <lb/>
            personally more deserving, and ruled over subjects of a bet­ <lb/>
            ter character.</p>
          <p>5. I commend likewise this proof of his forethought, that, <lb/>
            considering it good for Greece that as many satraps as pos­ <lb/>
            sible should revolt from the king, he was not induced either <lb/>
            by the presents or by the power of the king to feel any in­ <lb/>
            clination to form an alliance with him, but guarded against <lb/>
            being distrusted by those who were disposed to revolt. <lb/>
            6. Who, moreover, would not admire such conduct as the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing in him ? For the Persian king, thinking that if he <lb/>
            had the superiority in resources he would be able to bring <lb/>
            everything under his power, endeavoured for this reason to <lb/>
            get into his hands all the gold, all the silver, and all the most <lb/>
            valuable things in the world ; but Agesilaus, on the other <lb/>
            hand, so managed his household2 as to require none of these <lb/>
            things. 7. If any one disbelieves this, let him see what kind <lb/>
            of house contented him, and let him contemplate its doors ; for <lb/>
            he would imagine that they were still those selfsame doors which <note type="footnote">1 Perhaps the same Callias that is mentioned Hellen. iv. 1. 15 ; nothing <lb/>
            more is known of him. See Apophth. Lac., and Ælian, V. H. x. 20. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αντεσκεύσατο</foreign>.] This verb, which is nowhere else found, signifies <lb/>

          <p>1. I WILL also relate how in his private manners he formed <lb/>
            a contrast to the ostentation of the Persian king;5 for, in the <lb/>
            first place, the Persian prided himself on being seldom seen; but <lb/>
            Agesilaus delighted in being always visible, thinking that to <lb/>
            keep out of sight was suitable to dishonourable acts, but that <lb/>
            the light rather gave lustre to a life in conformity with what <lb/>
            was honourable.6 2. In the second place, the one boasted of <lb/>

            ters to an end slowly, while the other was most rejoiced when <lb/>
            he sent away people most speedily after obtaining from him <lb/>
            what they sought. 3. It is worth mentioning, too, how m cl <lb/>
            easier and readier enjoyment Agesilaus secured; for the <unclear>Per</unclear> <lb/>
            sian king, people go round the whole earth seeking what he <lb/>
            may drink with pleasure ; innumerable persons are constantly <lb/>
            inventing what he may eat with pleasure ; and that he may <lb/>
            sleep soundly, a person could scarcely enumerate in how many <lb/>
            contrivances they busy themselves. But Agesilaus, from be­ <lb/>
            ing fond of labour, drank with pleasure whatever chanced to <lb/>
            be at hand, and ate with pleasure whatever came before him ; <lb/>
            while for enabling him to sleep contentedly, any place was suit­ <lb/>
            able. 4. Nor was he only pleased with acting thus, but felt <lb/>
            delight in reflecting that he himself dwelt in the midst of <lb/>
            pleasures; while he saw that the barbarian, if he would live free <lb/>
            from trouble, must collect together from the ends of the earth <lb/>
            objects to please him. 5. It delighted him also, that he knew <lb/>
            he was able to submit without uneasiness to the dispensations <lb/>
            of the gods, whilst he saw the king avoiding the heat, and <lb/>
            shrinking from the cold ; imitating, through weakness of mind, <lb/>
            the life, not of brave men, but of the most helpless animals. <lb/>
            6. How, also, can it be otherwise than honourable to him, <lb/>
            and a proof of nobleness of mind, that he himself adorned his <lb/>
            own house with the actions and possessions of a man, rearing <lb/>
            numbers of dogs for hunting and horses for war, while he <lb/>
            persuaded his sister Cynisca to breed chariot-horses, and <lb/>
            thus showed, when she gained a victory, that the breeding of <lb/>
            such animals was a proof, not of manly desert, but of wealth. <lb/>
            7. Did he not also show clearly, in conformity with the noble­ <lb/>
            ness of his disposition, that if he conquered private persons in a <lb/>
            chariot-race, he would not be at all more worthy of honour ; <lb/>
            but that if he regarded his country as the dearest of all objects, <lb/>
            and acquired friends in the greatest number and of the high­ <lb/>
            est merit through the whole earth, and surpassed other men <lb/>
            in conferring benefits on his country and on his friends, and <lb/>
            in taking vengeance on his enemies, he would, in reality, <lb/>
            carry off the palm in contests of the most honourable and <lb/>
            noble character, and would become most celebrated, both <lb/>

          <p>The glory of Agesilaus vas due, not to fortune, but to his own abilities and <lb/>
            exertions. He is an example to all who would wish to deserve fame and <lb/>
            honour. Happiness of his life and death.</p>
          <p>I. IT is for such merits, then, that I praise Agesilaus; for <lb/>
            this conduct of his is not as if a man should meet with a <lb/>
            treasurer and should become indeed richer, but not more <lb/>
            economical; or as if a man should conquer his enemies when <lb/>
            disease has fallen on them, and should thus be more fortunate, <lb/>
            but not at all more of a general; but he who was most dis­ <lb/>
            tinguished for perseverance when it was a proper time for <lb/>
            labour, and for the exertion of his bodily powers when there <lb/>
            was emulation in manly activity, and for judgment when <lb/>
            there was need of counsel, appears to me, assuredly, to be justly <lb/>
            esteemed a man of truly eminent merit. 2. And if the line <lb/>
            and rule are an excellent invention for men, to assist them in <lb/>
            producing meritorious works, the virtue of Agesilaus would <lb/>
            seem to me to furnish a good example for those who wish to <lb/>
            pursue an honourable course of conduct. For who, while im­ <lb/>
            itating a pious man, would become impious, or while imitating <lb/>
            a just man, unjust, or while imitating a modest man, pre­ <lb/>
            sumptuous, or while imitating a continent man, incontinent ? <lb/>
            Agesilaus, indeed, did not feel. so much exalted in ruling <lb/>
            others as in ruling himself; not so much in leading his fellow- <lb/>
            citizens against their enemies, as in leading them to every <lb/>
            kind of virtue. 3. Nor, because he is praised now that he is <lb/>
            dead, let not any one for that reason consider this discourse <lb/>
            as a lamentation, but much rather as a eulogium ; for in the <lb/>
            first place, that which he heard while he lived 2 is said con­ <lb/>
            cerning him now; and, in the second place, what has less call <lb/>
            for lamentation than a life of glory and a death at mature <lb/>
            age ? or what is more deserving of eulogy than victories <note type="footnote"> 1 Agesilaus did not become great and famous by chance cr good luck, <lb/>

          <p>Various particulars respecting the character and acts of Agesilaus.</p>
          <p>i. I WISH also to go over his merit again under particular <lb/>
            heads,2 that the praises of it may be more easily remembered.</p>
          <p>Agesilaus respected temples, even such as were situated in <lb/>
            the territory of an enemy ; thinking that it was proper to <lb/>
            make the gods allies, not less in a hostile than in a friendly <lb/>
            country. He offered no violence to suppliants at the altars <lb/>
            of the gods, even though they were his enemies ; thinking that <lb/>
            it was absurd to call those who stole from temples sacrilegious, <lb/>
            and to regard those who dragged suppliants from the altars of <lb/>
            the gods as pious. 2. He never ceased declaring that he <lb/>
            thought the gods were no less pleased with pious works than <lb/>
            with pure sacrifices. When he was successful in any enter­ <lb/>
            prise, he did not exult more than becomes human beings, but <lb/>
            testified his. gratitude to the gods ; and when he was full of <lb/>
            confidence,3 he offered up more sacrifices than he made vows <lb/>
            when he was under apprehension. He had accustomed him­ <lb/>
            self also to appear cheerful when he was in fear, and, when he <lb/>
            was fortunate, to assume a modest demeanour. 3. Of his <lb/>
            friends he welcomed most heartily, not those who were most <lb/>
            powerful, but those who were warmest in affection towards <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἀναμάρτητος</foreign>.] Having done nothing to deserve censure; free front <lb/>

            him. He hated, not the man who defended himself when he <lb/>
            received an injury, but him who, when he received a kind­ <lb/>
            ness, showed himself <unclear>ungrateful</unclear>. He delighted in seeing those <lb/>
            who were greedy of dishonourable gains become poor, and in <lb/>
            assisting the honest to become wealthy ; wishing to make <lb/>
            justice more profitable than injustice. 4. He made it his busi­ <lb/>
            ness to converse with all classes of men, but to form inti­ <lb/>
            macies only with the good. When he heard men praise or <lb/>
            blame others, he thought that he could learn the character of <lb/>
            those speaking no less than that of those concerning whom <lb/>
            they spoke. Those who were deceived by friends he did not <lb/>
            blame, but those who were deceived by enemies he censured <lb/>
            in the utmost degree ; and he considered that to deceive those <lb/>
            who distrusted was wise, but to deceive those who trusted, <lb/>
            criminal. 5. He rejoiced at being praised by those who were <lb/>
            ready to blame what did not please them ; he disliked none <lb/>
            of those who expressed their thoughts openly, but guarded <lb/>
            against those who concealed their thoughts, as against snares. <lb/>
            He hated slanderers more than thieves, considering it a <lb/>
            greater loss to be deprived of friends than of money. 6. The <lb/>
            errors of private persons he regarded with indulgence, <lb/>
            but thought those of sovereigns of great consequence ; con­ <lb/>
            sidering that the former were the cause of few evils, the lattei <lb/>
            of many. He was of opinion, hot that indolence, but that <lb/>
            virtuous and honourable activity, was suitable to the dignity <lb/>
            of a king. 7. He forbore from having a statue of himself erected, <lb/>
            though many wished to make him a present of one; but he <lb/>
            never ceased labouring to raise monuments of his mind ; <lb/>
            considering that the one was the business of artists, the other <lb/>
            his own ; the one that of the wealthy, the other that of the <lb/>
            good.</p>
          <p>8. He managed pecuniary matters, not merely with justice, <lb/>
            but with liberality also, thinking that to abstain from other <lb/>
            men's property was enough for a just man, but that a liberal- <lb/>
            minded man ought to assist others even with his own resources. <lb/>
            He lived always in awe of the gods, considering that those who <lb/>
            live well are not yet happy, but that those who have died <lb/>
            gloriously are already blessed.1 9. He thought it a greater <lb/>
            calamity to neglect what was good knowingly, than ignor­ <lb/>
            antly. He valued no glory, unless he gained by labour that <note type="footnote"> I In allusion to the saying of Solon to Crœsus, Herod. i. 34. </note> <pb n="41"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="§ 10-15.] "/>which constituted it;1 and he appeared to me to regard virtue, <lb/>
            in common with few other men, not as endurance, but as <lb/>
            pleasure. He certainly rejoiced in being praised rather than <lb/>
            in acquiring wealth. He exhibited his valour more in con­ <lb/>
            junction with prudence than with temerity ; and he cultivated <lb/>
            wisdom in deeds more than in words. 10. While he was most <lb/>
            gentle to his friends, he was most terrible to his enemies ; <lb/>
            while he rivalled all in enduring toils, he gladly yielded the <lb/>
            palm in exertion to his friends, loving handsome deeds more <lb/>
            than handsome persons ; and while lie knew how to be moder­ <lb/>
            ate in prosperity, he could maintain a bold spirit in adversity. <lb/>
            11. He studied to please, not with jests, but in his general be­ <lb/>
            haviour ; and testified his magnanimity, not with haughtiness, <lb/>
            but with judicious forbearance ; while he contemned boasters, <lb/>
            he was more humble than even the modest. He took a pride <lb/>
            in the plainness of his own dress, and in the splendid equip­ <lb/>
            ments of his army, as well as in wanting as little as possible <lb/>
            himself, and in conferring as many benefits as possible on his <lb/>
            friends. 12. He was also most terrible as an opponent, but <lb/>
            most gentle when he had conquered ; hard to be deceived by <lb/>
            enemies, but most easy to be prevailed upon by friends ; and <lb/>
            while he put the fortunes of his adherents in safety, he made <lb/>
            it his constant business to weaken those of his adversaries. <lb/>
            13. His relations called him a lover of his family ; his familiar <lb/>
            friends, a friend free from evasion ; and they who had done him <lb/>
            any service, called him mindful; those who were wronged, <lb/>
            a helper ; those who were in dangers with him, a preserver <lb/>
            next to the gods.</p>
          <p>14. He seems to me also to be the only one of mankind that <lb/>
            showed that vigour of body decays with age, but that vigour <lb/>
            of mind in able men is free from decay. He himself, at least, <lb/>
            never failed to aim at high and honourable distinction, even <lb/>
            though the body could not support the exertion of the mind. <lb/>
            15. What kind of youth, accordingly, is there to which his old <lb/>
            age did not show itself superior ? for who in his maturity was <lb/>
            so formidable to his enemies as Agesilaus was when he had <lb/>
            reached the extreme boundary of life ? or at whose removal <lb/>
            did his enemies rejoice more than at that of Agesilaus, <lb/>
            although he died an old man ? or who inspired so much courage <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἦς οὐκ ἐξεπόνει</foreign> TO. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἴδια</foreign>.] Cujus quæ <unclear>prepria</unclear> essent non labore <unclear>ac</unclear> <lb/>

            end of his career ?1 or what young man did his friends regret <lb/>
            more than Agesilaus, when he died at an extreme age ? 16. But <lb/>
            he continued to be of such constant service to the state, that, <lb/>
            even when dead, he was carried to his eternal home 2 while <lb/>

            <title type="main">REMARKS ON THE HIERO.</title>
          </head>
          <p>THE visit of Simonides of Ceos to Hiero, at an advanced age, is <lb/>
            related by Ælian, Var. Hist. ix. 1.</p>
          <p>The Hiero here mentioned is not Hiero II., so much celebrated <lb/>
            as the friend and ally of the Romans, but Hiero I., who began to <lb/>
            reign B. c. 478. He succeeded his brother Gelon, whose govern­ <lb/>
            ment had been extremely mild and popular; that of Hiero was <lb/>
            of a far more severe and despotic character. From the admonitions <lb/>
            that Xenophon puts into the mouth of Simonides, it may be infer­ <lb/>
            red that there was in Hiero's conduct towards his subjects, and in <lb/>
            his ostentatious magnificence, much that was generally regarded with <lb/>
            disapprobation. But from the praises bestowed on him by Pindar, <lb/>
            and the attractions which his court presented, not only to him, but <lb/>
            to Æschylus, Bacchylides, Epicharmus, Xenophanes, and other men <lb/>
            of eminence, we may suppose that he had some considerable merits, <lb/>
            not only as a patron, but as a man.</p>
          <p>The voyage of Simonides to Syracuse is placed by Schneider in <lb/>
            the year B. c. 471, the seventh year of Hiero's reign, when Simo­ <lb/>
            nides was more than eighty years old. Hiero died five years after­ <lb/>
            wards. Simonides continued with him till his death, and died in <lb/>
            Sicily, about the age of ninety.</p>
          <p>To the discourses of Simonides with Hiero, there are allusions <lb/>
            in Plato's Epistle to Dionysius (Epist. ii.); and in Aristotle’s <lb/>
            Rhetoric, ii. 16.</p><pb n="44"/>

            <title type="main">HIERO: A DIALOGUE ON THE CONDITION OF ROYALTY, BETWEEN HIERO, KING OF SYRACUSE, AND SIMONIDES THE POET.</title>
          </head>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER I</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Hiero observes that private individuals enjoy more gratifications from the <lb/>
            senses than sovereigns; that they are more at liberty to seek objects of <lb/>
            curiosity or pleasure, as well in foreign countries as in their own; that <lb/>
            their ears are delighted with more sincere praise than those of kings; that <lb/>
            their appetites are less satiated with dainties ; that the odours with which <lb/>
            kings are perfumed please the sense of others rather than their own ; and <lb/>
            that kings have the disadvantage even in affairs of love.</p>
          <p>1. THE poet Simonides came once on a visit to the court of <lb/>
            Hiero. When they were both at leisure, Simonides said, <lb/>
            " Would you consent to tell me some things which it is prob­ <lb/>
            able that you know better than I ? "</p>
          <p>" And of what nature are those things," said Hiero, " which <lb/>
            I can be expected to know better than you, who are so wise <lb/>
            a man ? "</p>
          <p>2. “I know," said Simonides, "that you have been in a pri­ <lb/>
            vate station, and that you are now a prince. It is natural, <lb/>
            therefore, since you have had experience of both conditions, <lb/>
            that you should know better than I, in what respects the life <lb/>
            of a king and that of a private man differ, with reference to the <lb/>
            pleasures or pains usually attendant on mankind."</p>
          <p>3. " Well, then," said Hiero, " why should not you, as you are <lb/>
            still, for the present at least, in a private station, recall to my <lb/>
            memory the peculiarities of private life ? for by that means I <pb n="45"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="§ 4-9.]"/><lb/>
            think that I shall be best enabled to set before you the distinct­ <lb/>
            ive qualities of each condition."</p>
          <p>4. Simonides accordingly said, "I think that I have observed, <lb/>
            Hiero, that men in private life are affected with pleasure and <lb/>
            pain through their eyes, by objects which they see ; through <lb/>
            their ears, by sounds which they hear; through the nose, by <lb/>
            odours ; through the mouth, by meats and drinks ; and <lb/>
            through other bodily senses, by means which every one knows. <lb/>
            5. As to cold and warm, hard and soft, light and heavy <lb/>
            objects, it seems tome that, in distinguishing them, we receive <lb/>
            agreeable or painful impressions in all parts of our bodies <lb/>
            alike. But by good and evil, we appear to be delighted or <lb/>
            offended sometimes through the mind alone, and sometimes <lb/>
            through the mind and body in conjunction. 6. That we re­ <lb/>
            ceive pleasure from sleep, I seem to myself to be conscious ; <lb/>
            but how, and in what part of us, and at what time,1 I feel <lb/>
            myself rather at a loss to understand ; nor ought this perhaps <lb/>
            to seem surprising, since what affects us when we are awake <lb/>
            makes clearer impressions upon our senses than that which <lb/>
            influences us during sleep."</p>
          <p>7. To these observations Hiero replied, " For my part, <lb/>
            Simonides, I should be quite unable to tell how a king can <lb/>
            have any other perceptions besides those which you have <lb/>
            mentioned. Accordingly, as far as these points are concerned <lb/>
            I know not whether the life of a king differs in any respect <lb/>
            from that of a private person."</p>
          <p>s. " Yet in these particulars," said Simonides, "there would <lb/>
            be a difference,2 if the king is pleased by each of these means <lb/>
            as much as the private person, and has far fewer causes of <lb/>
            trouble."</p>
          <p>" Such, however, is not the case," said Hiero; "as kings, be <lb/>
            well assured, experience much less pleasure than persons <lb/>
            living in a middle rank of life, and have also more numerous <lb/>
            and considerable sources of trouble."</p>
          <p>9. " What you say," rejoined Simonides, "is incredible; <lb/>
            for, if it were so, why should many, even of those who seem <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ὁπως</foreign>—<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὥτινι</foreign>—<foreign xml:lang="grc">οπότε</foreign>.] In what manner, in what part of the body, <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[CH. 1"/><lb/>
            to be most sensible 1 persons, be desirous of reigning ? And <lb/>
            why should everybody envykings ? "</p>
          <p>10. “ Because, forsooth," replied Hiero, " they form their <lb/>
            opinions upon the subject without having had experience of <lb/>
            both conditions. On this point I will endeavour to convince <lb/>
            you that I speak the truth, beginning lilY remarks with the <lb/>
            sense of sight ; for I seem to have a recollection that it was <lb/>
            with an allusion to that sense that you commenced your <unclear>observ­</unclear> <lb/>
            ations on the subject. 11. Looking in the first place, then, <lb/>
            to objects that fall under our vision, I am persuaded that kings <lb/>
            have the disadvantage in that respect. In different countries <lb/>
            there are different objects worthy of being seen ; and to every <lb/>
            one of these private persons can go, and also to whatever cities <lb/>
            they please, for the purpose of viewing them ; as well as to <lb/>
            the public assemblies, where whatever is thought most worthy <lb/>
            of contemplation among mankind appears to be collected. <lb/>
            12. But kings cannot occupy themselves much with spectacles; <lb/>
            for neither is it safe for them to go where they will not be <lb/>
            stronger than those around them, nor have they their affairs <lb/>
            in so secure a condition at home, that they can intrust the <lb/>
            conduct of them to others, and go abroad ; since they have at <lb/>
            once to dread lest they be deprived of their sovereignty, and <lb/>
            lest they be rendered incapable of taking vengeance on those <lb/>
            who have wronged them.</p>
          <p>13. " ‘ But spectacles of this kind,' you will perhaps tell me, <lb/>
            ‘are presented to kings even while they remain at home.' <lb/>
            Assuredly, my dear Simonides, only few out of many ; and <lb/>
            these, of whatever nature, are sold at so high a price to kings, <lb/>
            that those who exhibit before them anything whatsoever, think <lb/>
            that they ought to be dismissed with the receipt of a far great­ <lb/>
            er reward from a sovereign for a short time, than they would <lb/>
            gain from all other men together for their whole life."</p>
          <p>14. “ But," remarked Simonides, " if you have the disad­ <lb/>
            vantage as to objects of sight, you have at least the superiority <lb/>
            as to hearing; for you are never without the most pleasing of <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ίκανωτάτων ἀνδρω̃ν</foreign>.] Sturz, in his Lexicon, takes <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἱκανός</foreign>, in this <lb/>
            passage, in the sense of bonus, probus, peritus. This seems to be a better <lb/>
            interpretation than Weiske's, who thinks that it means opibus pollenes, <lb/>

            all sounds, that of your own praise ; since all who approach <lb/>
            you applaud alike whatever you say, and whatever you do; <lb/>
            while you are exempted from hearing the most unpleasant of <lb/>
            sounds, that of censure, as no one ventures to reprove a king <lb/>
            to his face."</p>
          <p>15. " But what pleasure," said Hiero, "do you think those <lb/>
            who do not speak ill of a king give him, when he is well aware <lb/>
            that all of them, though they are silent, think everything that <lb/>
            is had of him ? Or what delight do you suppose his encomi­ <lb/>
            asts afford, when they are suspected of offering their praises <lb/>
            for the purpose of flattering ? "</p>
          <p>16. "This," said Simonides, "I certainly admit, that the <lb/>
            most agreeable of praises are those which proceed from men <lb/>
            of the most independent spirit.1 But (as you see)2 with regard <lb/>
            to the food on which we human beings are supported, you will <lb/>
            never persuade a single individual in the whole world, that <lb/>
            you do not derive from it far more pleasure than other men "</p>
          <p>it. "I know very well, Simonides," he replied, "that the <lb/>
            greater part of mankind consider that we eat and drink with <lb/>
            more pleasure than private individuals ; and for this reason, <lb/>
            that they think they themselves would partake with greater <lb/>
            relish of the entertainment which is set before us, than of that <lb/>
            which is set before them ; for whatever exceeds 3 that to which <lb/>
            we are accustomed affords gratification. is. On this account, <lb/>
            all mankind look forward with pleasure to festival days, <lb/>
            except kings; for their tables, being always supplied with <lb/>
            abundance, admit of no addition on festive occasions; so that, <lb/>
            first of all, in the pleasure derived from anticipation they are <lb/>
            decidedly inferior to private individuals. 19. And in the next <lb/>
            place," continued he, “ I am sure that you are very well aware <lb/>
            of this fact, that the more dishes a man has on his table be­ <lb/>
            yond what is sufficient, the sooner satiety in eating comes upon <lb/>
            him ; so that, with regard to the duration of this pleasure, he <note type="footnote">1 Agesilaus used to say, that he was best pleased with the praises of <lb/>

            who is served with profusion is in a worse condition than those <lb/>
            who live in a more moderate style."</p>
          <p>20. " Yet assuredly," said Simonides, " during the time that <lb/>
            the appetite requires food, those who feed on the more sumptu­ <lb/>
            ous dishes must experience greater gratification than those <lb/>
            who provide themselves with less expensive meats."</p>
          <p>21. " Do you not think then, Simonides," said Hiero, " that <lb/>
            he who is most pleased with any object attaches himself to <lb/>
            that object with the most fondness ? " <lb/>
            " Certainly," replied Simonides.</p>
          <p>“ Do you then see princes come with greater pleasure <lb/>
            to the food which is prepared for them than private individuals <lb/>
            to theirs ? "</p>
          <p>" Certainly not," replied Simonides, " very far from it; on <lb/>
            the contrary, they sit down to it with less pleasure, as many <lb/>
            seem to have been of opinion."</p>
          <p>22. " Have you not observed also," asked Hiero, " those <lb/>
            numerous artificial stimulants to the appetite which are set on <lb/>
            the tables of princes, acid, hot, pungent sauces, and things <lb/>
            of a similar nature ? "</p>
          <p>" Certainly," replied Simonides, “ and such things appear <lb/>
            to me to be quite unnatural to man."</p>
          <p>23. “ Do you think, then," said Hiero, " that such kinds of <lb/>
            food are anything else but excitements to an appetite ren­ <lb/>
            dered languid and weak with delicacies ? For, for my own <lb/>
            part, I know very well, and you doubtless know also, that <lb/>
            those who eat with a good appetite want no such artificial <lb/>
            appliances ?"</p>
          <p>24. " As to those expensive perfumes, indeed," said Simoni­ <lb/>
            des, "with which you anoint yourselves, I consider that those <lb/>
            who approach you have more enjoyment from you than you <lb/>
            yourselves have; as with regard also to unpleasant odours, it <lb/>
            is not he that has eaten of anything offensive that perceives it, <lb/>
            but rather those who come near him."</p>
          <p>25. " So too," said Hiero, “ he who has always all sorts of <lb/>
            dainties before him partakes of none of them with an appetite; <lb/>
            while he who rarely meets with any delicacy eats of it to the <lb/>
            full, whenever it comes before him, with a keen relish."</p>
          <p>26. “ The pleasures of love, then," continued Simonides, <lb/>
            "seem to be the only objects that can excite in you the desire <pb n="49"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="§ 27—33.] "/>of reigning; for in this respect it is in your power to attach <lb/>
            yourselves to whatever object you find eminently beautiful."</p>
          <p>27. " You have now, be assured," returned Hiero, "mention­ <lb/>
            ed that in which we are in a far inferior condition to private <lb/>
            persons; for, in the first place, that sort of marriage is regarded <lb/>
            as honourable which is contracted with our superiors in wealth <lb/>
            and influence, and is thought to confer a certain distinction, as <lb/>
            well as pleasure, on him who forms the connexion ; in the <lb/>
            next place to this, is a marriage of an equal with an equal; <lb/>
            but an alliance contracted with inferiors is considered alto­ <lb/>
            gether dishonourable and pernicious. 28. A prince, however, <lb/>
            unless he marry a foreign woman, must necessarily marry <lb/>
            from an inferior family; so that the object of his love does <lb/>
            not always fall to his lot. Again, the attentions paid to <lb/>
            princes by women proud of their nobility gratify them most; <lb/>
            but as to those that proceed from slaves, they are, if offered, <lb/>
            received with no pleasure, and, if at all neglected, the neglect <lb/>
            excites violent anger and ill-feeling. 29. But even in regard <lb/>
            to male objects of affection, the king, as to the pleasure to be <lb/>
            derived from them, labours under still greater disadvantage <lb/>
            than in connexions from which an offspring is expected; for that <lb/>
            it is when sexual unions are attended with love that they <lb/>
            afford the highest pleasure, we all assuredly know; but love <lb/>
            is usually excited in a king less than in any other person, <lb/>
            since love delights in pursuing, not that which is always ready, <lb/>
            but that which is still an object of hope. 30. As a person, <lb/>
            therefore, would have no enjoyment in drinking, if he had not <lb/>
            previously known thirst, so he who is unacquainted with the <lb/>
            longings of love has no experience of the most ravishing <lb/>
            pleasures."</p>
          <p>31. Such was the opinion that Hiero expressed. But <lb/>
            Simonides, with a smile, replied, "What say you, Hiero? Do <lb/>
            you intimate that no. desire for male objects of affection arises <lb/>
            in a king ? How is it, then, that you have such love foi <lb/>
            Dailochus, who is called the most beautiful of youths ? "</p>
          <p>32. " It is not assuredly, my dear Simonides," replied Hiero, <lb/>
            "because I am so eager to obtain from him that which appears <lb/>
            to be always ready for me, but because I long to effect that <lb/>
            which is least of all in the power of a king. 33. For I indeed <lb/>
            desire to have from Dailochus what. human nature perhaps <lb/>
            compels every one to desire from beautiful objects ; but what <note type="footnote"> VOL. III. </note> <note type="footnote"> B </note> <pb n="50"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[CH. 2."/><lb/>
            I desire to have I wish to obtain with mutual affection and <lb/>
            willingness, and to extort from him by force I feel less inclin­ <lb/>
            ation than I should feel to do an injury to my own person. <lb/>
            34. To take from enemies against their will, I consider to be <lb/>
            one of the highest gratifications; but favours from objects of <lb/>
            affection give us most pleasure when they bestow them volun­ <lb/>
            tarily. 35. From one who returns our affection, glances of the <lb/>
            eye, for instance, are pleasing, questions are pleasing, answers <lb/>
            are pleasing, and little contentions and resentments are the most <lb/>
            pleasing and fascinating of all. 36. But to enjoy objects of our <lb/>
            affection by force appears to be more like the act of a robber <lb/>
            than that of a lover. To a robber, indeed, the prospect of gain, <lb/>
            or the annoyance of an enemy, affords some gratification ; but <lb/>
            to snatch pleasure from an object of our desire, while that object <lb/>
            is suffering pain, to incur hatred by the advances of love, and <lb/>
            to lay hands on one that resents the familiarity, can such <lb/>
            conduct be regarded as otherwise than odious and contempt­ <lb/>
            ible ? 37. To a private individual, if the object of his affec­ <lb/>
            tion offers him a favour, it is at once a proof that that object <lb/>
            bestows the favour through love, since he knows that the <lb/>
            favour is conferred without any impulse from necessity. 38. <lb/>
            But as to a king, it is hardly ever possible for him to believe <lb/>
            that he is loved; for we know that those who submit to our <lb/>
            pleasure through fear, assimilate their manner, as much as <lb/>
            they can, to that of those who comply with our wishes from <lb/>
            love; and indeed there are none from whom conspiracies <lb/>
            against kings proceed more frequently than from those who <lb/>
            have affected to love them with the greatest sincerity."</p>

          </ab>
          <p>Simonides observes that the gratifications derived from the senses are com­ <lb/>
            paratively small, and mentions greater things in which sovereigns have <lb/>
            the advantage. Hiero endeavours to prove that sovereignty is but splendid <lb/>
            misery, being deprived of many enjoyments, and experiencing many in­ <lb/>
            conveniences and troubles. Kings are threatened by enemies at home <lb/>
            and abroad; they suffer all the vexations of war in common with free <lb/>
            states, but enjoy fewer advantages from it.</p>
          <p>1. To these remarks Simonides replied, " But the matters <lb/>
            which you mention appear to me to be but of very small weight; <pb n="51"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="§ 2-9.] "/>for I observe that many of those who are esteemed as manly <lb/>
            characters are far more moderate than other persons in regard <lb/>
            to food, and drink, and sauces, and abstain altogether from <lb/>
            the pleasures of love. 2. But you have certainly a great ad­ <lb/>
            vantage over private persons in the following respects: that <lb/>
            you conceive great projects, and soon carry them into ex­ <lb/>
            ecution ; that you have everything excellent in the greatest <lb/>
            abundance, and possess horses distinguished for spirit, arms <lb/>
            remarkable for beauty, ornaments of the highest value for <lb/>
            your wives, palaces of the greatest magnificence, adorned with <lb/>
            fu niture of the highest cost; that you have attendants <lb/>
            extremely numerous, and of the greatest expertness; and that <lb/>
            you are in the best condition to do harm to your enemies, and <lb/>
            good to your friends."</p>
          <p>3. Upon this Hiero observed, " That the greater part of man­ <lb/>
            kind are deluded by the splendour of royalty, I am not at all <lb/>
            surprised ; for the multitude appear to me to judge of people <lb/>
            as happy or miserable principally from what they see. 4. And <lb/>
            royalty exhibits to the world conspicuously, and unfolded fully <lb/>
            to the view, those objects which are esteemed of the highest <lb/>
            value; while it keeps the troubles of kings concealed in the in­ <lb/>
            most recesses of the soul, where both the happiness and the misery <lb/>
            of mankind reside. 5. That the multitude, therefore, as I <lb/>
            said, should be deceived as to this point, I do not at all wonder; <lb/>
            but that you, who appear to form your judgment of most <lb/>
            things rather from reflection than by the eye, should labour <lb/>
            under the same ignorance, seems to me quite astonishing. <lb/>
            6. For my own part, I know from experience extremely well, <lb/>
            and I assure you, Simonides, that kings have the smallest <lb/>
            share of the greatest enjoyments, and the largest share of the <lb/>
            greatest of evils. 7. For example, if peace is thought to be <lb/>
            a great good to mankind, kings have the least participation of <lb/>
            it; if war is deemed a great evil, kings have the greatest <lb/>
            part of it. 8. Private individuals, if their country is not en­ <lb/>
            gaged in a public war, have full liberty to travel wherever <lb/>
            they please, without the least fear that any one will put them <lb/>
            to death; but all kings travel everywhere as in an enemy's <lb/>
            country; at least they think it necessary to go armed them­ <lb/>
            selves, and to surround their persons perpetually with armed <lb/>
            men. 9. Again, private individuals, if they go to make war <lb/>
            in an enemy's country, still find, as soon as they return home <note type="footnote"> E '2 </note> <pb n="52"/>
            <note type="margin"> [CH. 2. </note> <lb/>
            that there is safety for them there ; but kings, when they <lb/>
            come to their own capitals, are conscious that they are then <lb/>
            in the midst of the greatest number of enemies. to. Or, if <lb/>
            an enemy come against a city in superior numbers, the <lb/>
            weaker party, as long as they are without the walls, will in­ <lb/>
            deed seem to be in danger, but when they have withdrawn <lb/>
            into the fortifications, will consider that they are all in safety; <lb/>
            but a king is not in security even when he has retired into his <lb/>
            own palace, but finds that he has then the greatest cause to <lb/>
            be upon his guard. 11. Private persons, too, during a truce <lb/>
            or a settled peace, enjoy cessation from the troubles of war <lb/>
            but kings are never at peace with those whom they hold in <lb/>
            subjection ; nor can a king ever place full reliance on treaties.</p>
          <p>12. “Again, there are wars in which free states are engaged <lb/>
            with one another, and wars which kings carry on against <lb/>
            people whom they have forced into subjection. Of these wars, <lb/>
            whatever inconveniences those between free states occasion, <lb/>
            the same inconveniences also a king experiences in his; 13 <lb/>
            fur both the one and the other are obliged to be constantly in <lb/>
            arms, to be upon guard, and to expose themselves to dangers ; <lb/>
            and both, if they meet with any disaster from defeat, are <lb/>
            equally doomed to suffer from it. 14. Thus far, both kinds <lb/>
            of wars are on an equality ; but of the advantages with which <lb/>
            those are attended that are carried on by free states against <lb/>
            free states, the king has never any share. 15. For when the <lb/>
            inhabitants of a free city have overcome the enemy in the <lb/>
            field, it is not easy to express the pleasure which they feel in <lb/>
            putting their opponents to flight, as well as in pursuing and <lb/>
            making havoc of them ; how much they glory in such an <lb/>
            exploit; what splendid distinctions they claim for themselves; <lb/>
            and how they exult in the thought that they have augmented <lb/>
            the strength of their commonwealth. 16. Each vindicates to <lb/>
            himself some share in the honour of the enterprise, and main­ <lb/>
            tains that he has himself killed the greatest number of the <lb/>
            enemy; and it is difficult to find an occasion on which they do <lb/>
            not exaggerate, and assume that they have killed more than <lb/>
            were really left dead; so honourable does it appear to them to <lb/>
            have gained a complete victory. 17. But as for a king, when <lb/>
            he suspects, and becomes actually convinced, that people are <lb/>
            forming designs against him, and puts them to death, he is <lb/>
            aware that he will not by that means increase the strength of <pb n="53"/>
            <note type="margin"> § 18.] </note> <lb/>
            his kingdom; he knows that he shall rule over fewer subjects, <lb/>
            and cannot feel pleased, much less elated, at what he has done ; <lb/>
            he even extenuates his act as far as he can, and makes an <lb/>
            apology for his conduct by alleging that he has done nothing <lb/>
            with undue severity; so far from honourable do such proceed­ <lb/>
            ings appear even to himself. is. And when those whom he <lb/>
            dreaded are cut off, he is not at all the more free from appre­ <lb/>
            hension,1 but finds that he must keep himself still more on his <lb/>
            guard than before. Such warfare is a king, as I exemplify <lb/>
            in my own person, perpetually waging.</p>

          <p>Sovereigns have few real friends: they live in dread of their own relatives.</p>
          <p>1. "CONSIDER, moreover, what sort of friendships kings <lb/>
            enjoy. But let us reflect, in the first place, how great a <lb/>
            blessing friendship is to mankind; 2. for whoever is beloved by <lb/>
            others, those who love him hail his coming with pleasure, and <lb/>
            take delight in serving him; when he leaves them, they are <lb/>
            concerned at his absence, and when lie returns, they welcome <lb/>
            him with transport; they rejoice at his good fortune, and if <lb/>
            they see him in any trouble, are ready to assist him. 3. Nor is <lb/>
            it unknown to whole communities that friendship is the greatest <lb/>
            and most valuable of blessings to mortals; since many states <lb/>
            allow the putting of adulterers to death, alone of all offenders, <lb/>
            with impunity; and evidently for this reason, that they regard <lb/>
            them as destroyers of that friendship which women ought to <lb/>
            have for their husbands. 4. For when a woman has been <lb/>
            forced into a breach of chastity by some concurrence of cir­ <lb/>
            cumstances, her husband may not on that account esteem her <lb/>
            the less, if her friendship for him appear to continue inviolate. <lb/>
            5. So great a happiness do I esteem it to be loved, that I <lb/>
            really fancy every blessing, both from gods and men, ready <lb/>

             <lb/>
            of this so valuable a good kings have of all men the least <lb/>
            share ; and if you wish to be convinced, my dear Simonides, <lb/>
            that I say what is true, attend to the following consideration.</p>
          <p>7. “ The finest friendships appear to be those of parents for <lb/>
            children, of children for parents, of brothers for brothers, of <lb/>
            wives for husbands, and those that subsist between daily <lb/>
            associates. 8. If you reflect on the subject, then, you will find <lb/>
            that it is private persons who are most sincerely beloved by <lb/>
            their connexions; and that many rulers have put to death their <lb/>
            own children, and that many have been cut off by the hands <lb/>
            of their own offspring; that many brothers have killed one <lb/>
            another in contending for thrones; and that many sovereigns <lb/>
            have been murdered by their own wives, or -by associates who <lb/>
            pretended to be their greatest friends. 9. How is it possible, <lb/>
            then, to imagine that those who are thus hated by such as are <lb/>
            most strongly prompted by nature, and obliged by the laws, <lb/>
            to love them, can be objects of affection to any one else ?</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER IV.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>inability to trust in those about him a great trouble to a sovereign. He <unclear>is</unclear> <lb/>
            not protected by his country and by the laws like a private <unclear>individual</unclear>. <lb/>
            He has less pleasure in his wealth than those of an inferior condition have <lb/>
            in theirs. Kings are often forced to rob others, or to be in want them­ <lb/>
            selves.</p>
          <p>1. " MusT not he also who has but little trust in others feel <lb/>
            himself deprived of a very great blessing? For what society <lb/>
            can be agreeable without mutual confidence, or what pleasing <lb/>
            intercourse can there be without such confidence, even be­ <lb/>
            tween man and wife ? What servant in our family can give <lb/>
            us satisfaction who is distrusted ? 2. But of this reciprocal <lb/>
            confidence a monarch has of all men the least share, since he <lb/>
            cannot live without perpetual distrust of every sort of food and <lb/>
            drink, however exquisite, that is set before him; and he re­ <lb/>
            quires his attendant, even before he makes an offering to the <lb/>
            gods, to taste of it, because he suspects that he may eat or <lb/>
            drink something poisonous in it.</p>
          <p>3 "To other men, moreover, their country is of the highest <pb n="55"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="§ 4—8.]"/> <lb/>
            value; for citizens act as guards to one another, without <lb/>
            stipend, against their slaves, an.' act as guards, too, to one <lb/>
            another against bad characters, in order that no one of their <lb/>
            countrymen may fall by a violent death. 4. They have even <lb/>
            gone so far in precaution, that many states have made a law <lb/>
            that no one shall be accounted guiltless who associates with <lb/>
            one who is polluted with blood; so that every member of the <lb/>
            state lives in safety under the protection afforded by his <lb/>
            country. 5. But with tyrants 1 the very reverse is the case ; <lb/>
            for states, instead of avenging their deaths, bestow great <lb/>
            honour on him who kills a tyrant; and instead of excluding <lb/>
            tyrannicides from their temples, as they exclude the murderers <lb/>
            of private citizens, they even place in their temples the <lb/>
            statues of those who have been guilty of tyrannicide.</p>
          <p>6. “If, again, you think that a monarch, because he has <lb/>
            greater wealth than private individuals, has necessarily greater <lb/>
            enjoyment from it, such is not the fact, my dear Simonides; <lb/>
            but, as when athletes overcome such as are ignorant of gym­ <lb/>
            nastic exercises, their victory gives them no pleasure, but when <lb/>
            they are vanquished by accomplished antagonists, their defeat <lb/>
            causes them annoyance; so neither is a king delighted merely <lb/>
            when he is seen to possess more than private individuals, but <lb/>
            is vexed when he possesses less than other kings; for these he <lb/>
            considers as his proper rivals in regard to wealth.</p>
          <p>7. " Nor are the objects of his desire attained sooner by a <lb/>
            monarch than a private man; for a private man desires per­ <lb/>
            haps a house, a field, or a slave; but a king aims at acquiring <lb/>
            cities, or extensive provinces, or harbours, or fortresses, which <lb/>
            are much more difficult and hazardous of acquisition than the <lb/>
            objects coveted by private individuals. 8. You will even see <lb/>
            but few that are really poor among private persons, in com­ <lb/>
            parison with the many that may be called poor among sove­ <lb/>
            reigns; for what is much, or what is sufficient, is not estimated <lb/>
            by the number of a man's possessions, but by the exigencies of <note type="footnote">1 The word tyrant signified one who held -absolute power over a state, <lb/>
            whether he inherited that power or obtained it for himself. He might <lb/>
            exercise his power either mildly or despotically, according to his natural <lb/>
            disposition. Those whom it was thought lawful to kill were chiefly such <lb/>
            as acted as tyrants in the English sense of the word ; though many of the <lb/>
            Spartans, and severer republicans, deemed it allowable to kill any tyrant. <lb/>
            whatever was his chaiact er. </note> <pb n="56"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[CH. 5."/><lb/>
            his condition; so that what exceed hat which is sufficient <lb/>
            may be called much, and what falls short of sufficiency little. 9. <lb/>
            To a king, accordingly, revenues that are many times greater <lb/>
            than those of any private individual may be less than sufficient <lb/>
            for his necessary expenses; for private persons may contract <lb/>
            their daily expenses as they please, but with kings this is im­ <lb/>
            possible, since their most necessary expenditure is for the <lb/>
            guard of their persons, and to retrench any part of that ex­ <lb/>
            penditure 1 would but threaten their destruction.</p>
          <p>10. “ As for those, again, who can obtain by lawful means <lb/>
            whatever they need, how can we consider them poor? But <lb/>
            as to those who are obliged by want to live in a course of un­ <lb/>
            just and dishonourable contrivances, how can we fairly regard <lb/>
            them otherwise than as poor and wretched? 11. Kings, then, <lb/>
            are frequently compelled to spoil alike temples and individuals, <lb/>
            in defiance of law, through want of daily supplies for their <lb/>
            necessary expenses; for they are forced to maintain troops as <lb/>
            if they were constantly at war, or become powerless.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>Sovereigns are often forced to live in fear even of the most honourable and <lb/>
            worthy of their subjects. A sovereign is obliged to employ many whom he <lb/>
            dislikes. He is most afraid of rebellion among his people when they are <lb/>
            most prosperous.</p>
          <p>1. "I WILL mention to you, also, my dear Simonides, <lb/>
            another unhappiness of kings. They distinguish, not less <lb/>
            accurately than private persons, which of their subjects are <lb/>
            orderly,2 and wise, and just; but, instead of regarding such <lb/>
            characters with admiration, they look upon them with <lb/>
            dread. They fear men of spirit, lest they should make some <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τὸ δὲ τούτων συντέμνειν</foreign>.] This is the reading of all the editions. <lb/>

            should engage in some conspiracy; men of virtue, lest the <lb/>
            multitude should desire to be governed by them. 2. But <lb/>
            when, from apprehension, they have removed such characters <lb/>
            out of the way, what others are left them to employ in their <lb/>
            service, except the dishonest, and licentious, and servile ? <lb/>
            The dishonest are trusted, because, like monarchs themselves, <lb/>
            they live in fear of the people, lest they should become free <lb/>
            and become their masters; the licentious, because of their <lb/>
            attachment to present power;1 and the servile, because they <lb/>
            do not even think themselves deserving to be free. This <lb/>
            accordingly appears to me to be a great calamity, to esteem <lb/>
            some characters as good, and to be obliged to employ those <lb/>
            of a different sort.</p>
          <p>3. " It is necessary, besides, that a monarch have a regard <lb/>
            for his people, for without them he cannot be either safe or <lb/>
            prosperous ; yet the necessity of supporting his authority com­ <lb/>
            pels him to be severe upon them ; for monarchs do not delight <lb/>
            in rendering their subjects brave or warlike; they rather <lb/>
            take pleasure, on the contrary, in raising mercenaries from <lb/>
            foreign parts to overawe their own people, and using them as <lb/>
            guards of their persons. 4. Nor even when, from a full <lb/>
            harvest, there is abundance of provisions, does the monarch <lb/>
            rejoice with his people on the occasion ; for the more they are <lb/>
            in want, the more submissive he expects to find them.</p>

          <p>Hiero compares the pleasures of the life which he enjoyed as a private per­ <lb/>
            son with the anxieties to which he is subject in his present position.</p>
          <p>1. "I WISH to mention to you also, Simon ides, those pleasures <lb/>
            which I used to enjoy when I was a private individual, but <lb/>
            of which, since I have become a king, I feel myself deprived. <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τη̃ς εἰς</foreign> TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρὸν ἐξουσίας ἕνεκα</foreign>. J " For the sake of power for the <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[CH. 6."/><lb/>
            2. I conversed familiarly with my equals in age, delighted <lb/>
            with their society, as they were with mine. I spent my time <lb/>
            alone, whenever I desired to enjoy the tranquillity of solitude <lb/>
            or I joined in convivial entertainments with my friends ; <lb/>
            oftentimes till we forgot whatever is disagreeable in human <lb/>
            life ; oftentimes till we lost all thought in songs and carous­ <lb/>
            ings and dancings ; and oftentimes till we gratified our most <lb/>
            extravagant inclinations, my own as well as those of my asso­ <lb/>
            ciates.1 3. But now I am debarred from the companionship <lb/>
            of those who took pleasure in my society, as I have slaves <lb/>
            only for associates instead of friends ; I am deprived of all <lb/>
            gratification in the society of those companions that I have, <lb/>
            because I see in them no good feeling towards me ; and 1 <lb/>
            guard against intoxication and sleep, as against conspirators. <lb/>
            4. But to fear a multitude, and to fear solitude, to fear the <lb/>
            absence of guards, and to fear the guards themselves, to be <lb/>
            unwilling to have unarmed men around me, and to see armed <lb/>
            men without pleasure, can this be regarded as other than a <lb/>
            wretched state of existence ? 5. To place, besides, greater <lb/>
            confidence in foreigners than in one's own countrymen, in <lb/>
            barbarians than in Greeks, to desire to treat free men as <lb/>
            slaves, and to be forced to give slaves freedom,2 do not all <lb/>
            these things appear to you indications of a mind disturbed by <lb/>
            terrors ? 6. But fear not only causes uneasiness in the mind <lb/>
            itself, but is the constant destroyer of all our pleasures. 7. If <lb/>
            you have any experience of warlike proceedings, Simonides, <lb/>
            and have ever been stationed in close opposition to a body <lb/>
            of the enemy, call to mind how little food you ate, and how <lb/>
            little sleep you took, at that time. 8. And uneasy as were <lb/>
            the sensations which you then experienced, such, and even <lb/>
            more disquieting, are those of tyrants; for tyrants fancy that <lb/>
            they see enemies, not merely in front of them, but on all <lb/>
            sides."</p>
          <p>9. Simonides, on hearing these observations, said in reply, <lb/>
            " You appear to me to state some part of your argument too <lb/>
            strongly; for war, indeed, is attended with constant alarms ; <lb/>
            but yet, Hiero, when we are in the field, we enjoy our dinner <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μέχρι κοινη̃ς ἐπιθυμίας ἐμη̃ς τε καὶ τω̃ν παρόντων</foreign>.] Schneider sus­ <lb/>

            and out sleep, after we have posted our sentinels, in perfect <lb/>
            security.”</p>
          <p>10. " Very true," said Hiero, "for the laws keep watch <lb/>
            over the guards themselves,1 so that they fear for themselves <lb/>
            as well as for you ; but kings have guards that are merely <lb/>
            hired for pay, like labourers in harvest. 11. It is incumbent <lb/>
            on guards, indeed, to make nothing so much their object as to <lb/>
            be faithful; but it is far more difficult to find one among our <lb/>
            guards faithful, than to find numbers of trustworthy workmen <lb/>
            in any trade that you may desire ; especially as our guards at­ <lb/>
            tend us for the sake of money, and have it in their power to <lb/>
            gain much more money in a short time, by killing their so­ <lb/>
            vereign, than they would receive from him for affording him <lb/>
            protection for a long period.</p>
          <p>12. "But as to the privilege for which you said that we <lb/>
            were to be envied, that of being able to benefit our friends, <lb/>
            and to suppress our enemies, beyond all other men, what you <lb/>
            say is by no means just. 13. For how can you think of us as <lb/>
            ever conferring favours on friends, when you are well aware <lb/>
            that he who receives most from us would be most pager to <lb/>
            withdraw himself as soon as possible from our sight, since <lb/>
            whatever a man receives from an absolute prince, he thinks <lb/>
            no part of his own till he is out of that prince's power ?</p>
          <p>14. "Or how can you say thatprinces have the greatest power <lb/>
            of subduing their enemies, when they' are sensible that all are <lb/>
            their enemies, who are subject to their rule ? It is not in <lb/>
            their power to put all to death, or to confine them all in <lb/>
            prison ; for over whom would they then rule ? But though <lb/>
            they know that their subjects are their enemies, they must at <lb/>
            the same time both guard against them, and employ their <lb/>
            services. 15. Be assured of this also, Simonides, that such of <lb/>
            their subjects as princes dread, they can neither see living <lb/>
            : without uneasiness, nor put to death without uneasiness. <lb/>
            As with regard to a horse, if he have good qualities, but <lb/>
            makes us fear that he may cause some fatal accident, we should <lb/>
            feel the utmost reluctance, on account of his value, to put <lb/>
            him to death, yet we should also feel extremely unwilling to <lb/>
            make use of him, lest, amidst the danger which we must in­ <lb/>
            cur, he should do us some irreparable mischief. <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Αὐτω̃ν</foreign>—<foreign xml:lang="grc">προφυλάττουσιν</foreign> ot <unclear>νόμoι</unclear>.] T e guards do their duty thro ugh <lb/>

          <p>Simonides observes that honour, a great object of human desire, is paid to <lb/>
            kings. Hiero replies that such honour is rather forced than voluntary. <lb/>
            Simonides asks why then kings do not resign their power: Hiero answers <lb/>
            that, though they cannot maintain their position without trouble, they <lb/>
            cannot retire from it without danger to themselves.</p>
          <p>1. SIMONIDES, having listened to these observations from <lb/>
            Hiero, said, " Yet, Hiero, honour appears to me to be an ob­ <unclear/> <lb/>
            ject of great importance, since men submit to every kind of <lb/>
            labour, and undergo every sort of danger, with the desire of at­ <lb/>
            taining it. 2. You sovereigns, though royalty is attended with <lb/>
            so many troubles as you describe, are nevertheless strongly at­ <lb/>
            tached to it, as it seems, in order that you may be honoured, and <lb/>
            that all around you may readily execute whatever you com­ <lb/>
            mand; that everybody may fix their gaze upon you, may rise <lb/>
            from their seats before you, and yield you the way, and that all <lb/>
            about you may show respect for you by their words and ac­ <lb/>
            tions ; for such are the honours which subjects pay to so­ <lb/>
            vereigns, and to any one else to whom they have occasion to <lb/>
            testify respect. 3. For it is in this desire of honour, Hiero, <lb/>
            that man seems to me to differ from the other animals ; since <lb/>
            in eating, and drinking, and sleep, and sexual intercourse, all <lb/>
            animals appear to find equal gratification; but the love of hon­ <lb/>
            our is not implanted by nature in the irrational animals, nor, in­ <lb/>
            deed, in all men; and they in whom the love of honour and <lb/>
            praise is innate, are those who are elevated most above the brutes <lb/>
            and who are justly named men, and not merely human beings. <lb/>
            4. So that you seem to me to submit to all the inconveni­ <lb/>
            ences which you experience in sustaining royalty not without <lb/>
            good reason, since you are honoured far above other mortals. <lb/>
            Indeed, no human pleasure seems to approach nearer to the <pb n="61"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="§ 5-10.] "/>divine nature than the delight which is felt from receiving <lb/>
            honour."</p>
          <p>5. " But I assure you, my dear Simonides," said Hiero, in <lb/>
            reply, " that the honours offered to sovereigns appear to me <lb/>
            extremely similar to the pleasures which I have observed to <lb/>
            you that they receive from love. 6. For the complaisances <lb/>
            paid us by such as have no reciprocal affection for us, we al­ <lb/>
            lowed, were not to be regarded as favours, and submission ex­ <lb/>
            torted by force was admitted to give no real pleasure ; and in <lb/>
            like manner services that proceed from such as fear us cannot <lb/>
            be considered as honours. 7. How, indeed, can we imagine <lb/>
            that those who rise from their seats by compulsion rise to do <lb/>
            honour to persons that do them harm,1 or that those who give <lb/>
            the way to their superiors, give it from a desire of showing <lb/>
            respect to those who -tyrannize over them ? 8. A vast number <lb/>
            of mankind make presents to those whom they hate, and offer <lb/>
            them when they are most in fear of suffering some harm from <lb/>
            them ; but such acts, I consider, must justly be regarded as <lb/>
            acts of servility; whereas real respect, as it appears to me, <lb/>
            proceeds from quite contrary motives. 9. Since, when people <lb/>
            think that a man is capable of doing them service, and are in <lb/>
            expectation of enjoying benefits from him, and consequently2 <lb/>
            have his name in their mouths with praise, contemplate him <lb/>
            each as his own benefactor, gladly make way for him, and rise <lb/>
            from their seats before him from love, and not from fear, crown <lb/>
            him for his public virtues and beneficence, and are ready to be­ <lb/>
            stow other marks of esteem upon him, they who pay such respect <lb/>
            seem to me to honour such a man in sincerity, and he who is <lb/>
            thought worthy of such regard appears to be truly honoured. <lb/>
            10. A man who is thus held in consideration, I regard as <lb/>
            eminently happy ; for I observe that he is not conspired <lb/>
            against, but becomes an object of solicitude, in order that <lb/>
            he may suffer no harm, and that he passes a life free from <lb/>
            fear, and danger, and peril, and in the midst of prosperity; <lb/>
            while a tyrant, my dear Simonides, passes day and night, be <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Διὰ</foreign> TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">τιμα̃ν τοὺς ἀδικου̃ντας</foreign>.] By oi <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀδικου̃ντες</foreign> are here meant <lb/>

            die for his usurpation."</p>
          <p>11. When Simonides had heard these remarks, “ How is it <lb/>
            then," said he, “ if kingly power is attended with so much <lb/>
            trouble, and you are sensible of its vexations, that you, Hiero, <lb/>
            do not free yourself from so great an evil, and that no other <lb/>
            sovereign has ever voluntarily laid down power, after he had <lb/>
            once become possessed of it ? "</p>
          <p>12. " Because," replied Hiero, "it is on this very account <lb/>
            that royalty is the most wretched condition imaginable; for <lb/>
            there is no possibility of setting one's self free from it, since <lb/>
            how can any sovereign command sufficient resources to make <lb/>
            restitution of property to those from whom he has taken it, <lb/>
            or how can he make atonement in bonds to those whom lie <lb/>
            has cast into prison, or how can he offer a sufficient number <lb/>
            of lives to die for those whom he has put to death ?1 is. If, <lb/>
            indeed, my dear Simonides, it would be a gain to any man to <lb/>
            hang himself, I certainly think that it would be of the very <lb/>
            greatest advantage to a tyrant to do so; for he alone is pro­ <lb/>
            fited neither by retaining his troubles nor by laying them <lb/>
            aside."</p>

            <title type="sub">CHAPTER VII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Simonides observes that a sovereign has more facilities than other men for <lb/>
            securing good-will and attachment, as small favours from him are more <lb/>
            valued than greater ones from private individuals. Hiero replies that a <lb/>
            sovereign must also do many things that render him unpopular.</p>
          <p>1. SIMONIDES, in reply, said, " I am not indeed surprised, <lb/>
            Hiero, that you feel so despondingly, at present, with respect <lb/>
            to royalty, since, having a desire to be loved by mankind, you <lb/>
            regard your station as an impediment to your wishes. I think <lb/>
            that I can show you, however, that kingly power is no obsta- <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ψυχὰς</foreign>—<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀποθανουμένας</foreign>.] I am persuaded that Xenophon wrote <lb/>

            cle to gaining love, but that it ever gives an advantage to him <lb/>
            who holds it, in reference to that object, over private individu­ <lb/>
            als. 2. But in considering whether it is so, let us not examine <lb/>
            whether the monarch, from having greater power, can also <lb/>
            bestow greater favours, but, supposing that a private person <lb/>
            and a king confer equal favours, contemplate which .of the <lb/>
            two will, through the influence of such favours, command1 <lb/>
            the greater feeling of acknowledgment from those whom lie <lb/>
            obliges. I will begin with examples from matters of lighter <lb/>
            moment. 3. First, let a king and a private individual address <lb/>
            any person in a friendly manner; whose salutation do you <lb/>
            think will give the greater pleasure to the hearer? Or, if <lb/>
            they both praise the same person, whose praise do you think <lb/>
            will produce the greater gratification ? Or, after a sacrifice,2 <lb/>
            let each invite him to his table, whose invitation do you think <lb/>
            would be received with the greater respect ? 4. Or let them <lb/>
            pay equal attention to a sick person, is it not certain that the <lb/>
            attentions of the more powerful will convey the higher grati­ <lb/>
            fication ? Or let them make presents of equal cost; is it not <lb/>
            indubitable that gifts of half the price from the more influ­ <lb/>
            ential would be valued at a higher rate than the whole of <lb/>
            what is bestowed by the private individual ? 5. To me it <lb/>
            appears that there descends as it were from the gods a certain <lb/>
            dignity and grace to attend on the person of a king; a dig­ <lb/>
            nity which not only renders the man himself more majestic, <lb/>
            but makes us look on the same man with more pleasure when <lb/>
            he is invested with royalty than when he is in a private sta­ <lb/>
            tion ; and we feel a greater pride in conversing with those <lb/>
            who are superior to us in honour, than with those who are on <lb/>
            a level with us.</p>
          <p>6. " As to love, too, in reference to which you found the <lb/>
            greatest fault with the condition of royalty, the objects of a <lb/>
            king's affection are least offended at old age in him, and with <lb/>
            whomsoever he is familiar, it is accounted no disgrace to him; <lb/>
            for the very honour received from the prince casts such a <lb/>
            lustre on the connexion, as to throw into the shade whatever <note type="footnote"> 1 Dindorf, and most modern editors, read <foreign xml:lang="grc">κτα̃ται</foreign> : Schneider and <lb/>

          <p>7. " Since, then, by equal services you secure greater re­ <lb/>
            gard than private persons, why ought you not to be far more <lb/>
            beloved than they, when you have it in your power to benefit <lb/>

            tion to bestow far more liberal donations ?"</p>
          <p>8. Hiero immediately replied by saying, " Because, as­ <lb/>
            suredly, my dear Simonides, necessity obliges us to do many <lb/>
            ' more of those acts by which men incur unpopularity than <lb/>
            private persons are called upon to do. 9. We must raise <lb/>
            money by taxes, if we would have enough for our necessary <lb/>
            expenditure; we must compel men to guard whatever requires <lb/>
            to be guarded; we must punish criminals, and repress such <lb/>
            as are inclined to be insolent; and whenever there is occasion <lb/>
            for activity, to undertake an expedition by sea or land, we <lb/>
            must not intrust an affair of the kind to negligent com­ <lb/>
            manders.1 10. A king has also need of mercenary troops ; <lb/>
            no burden is more oppressive on the people than they are, for <lb/>
            they consider that such troops are maintained, not for the <lb/>
            safety of the state,2 but as an instrument of tyranny."</p>

          <p>Simonides advises Hiero to stimulate his subjects to honourable exertion, by <lb/>
            offering rewards for such as meritoriously distinguished themselves.</p>
          <p>1. IN answer to this Simonides again observed, "I do not <lb/>
            deny, Hiero, that attention must be given to all these objects; <lb/>
            yet, though some of these concerns appear to tend greatly to <lb/>
            unpopularity, others seem to lead directly to the attainment <lb/>
            of public favour. 2. To teach things that are most excellent, <lb/>

            and to commend and honour him who does them best, is an <lb/>
            office that must secure regard; while to rebuke and coerce, <lb/>
            to fine and punish, him who fails in his duty, must necessarily <lb/>
            rather provoke dislike. 3. I am therefore of opinion that a <lb/>
            ruler should commit the task of punishing such as require <lb/>
            severity to others, but that he should execute the office of <lb/>
            bestowing rewards in his own person. 4. That such a course <lb/>
            would be attended with good effects, experience shows ; <lb/>
            for when we wish choruses1 to contend for honours, the pre­ <lb/>
            sident2 himself proposes the prizes, but to the choragi is <lb/>
            committed the duty of assembling the members of the chorus, <lb/>
            to others that of instructing them, and of imposing penalties <lb/>
            on such as are deficient in their parts. Thus in such matters <lb/>
            the agreeable duty is done by the president, and that which <lb/>
            is of a contrary nature by others. 5. What obstacle is there, <lb/>
            then, to the management of other affairs in the city in a simi­ <lb/>
            lar manner ? All communities have their several divisions, <lb/>
            some into tribes, others into moræ, others into lochi,3 and over <lb/>
            each of these divisions an officer is appointed. 6. If, there­ <lb/>
            fore, we should offer rewards to these divisions, as we offer <lb/>
            them to choruses, for having their arms in good order, for <lb/>
            excellent discipline, for skill in riding, for bravery in the <lb/>
            field, for integrity in civil transactions, it is natural to suppose <lb/>
            that all such duties would, from emulation, be sedulously ob­ <lb/>
            served ; 7. and, assuredly, the citizens in general, from de­ <lb/>
            sire of honour, would be more ready to undertake an expedi-. <lb/>
            tion whithersoever they might be required, and contribute <lb/>
            more promptly to the support of the state whenever circum­ <lb/>
            stances might demand; and besides (which is of all things <lb/>
            the most beneficial, though it has been but little promoted by <lb/>
            the influence of emulation), agriculture itself would be greatly <lb/>

            since by this means many advantages would be gained by <lb/>
            those who should vigorously apply themselves to that occupa­ <lb/>
            tion ; 8. for the public revenues would be augmented, and <lb/>
            temperance would be a closer attendant on increased ex­ <lb/>
            ertion ; and fewer crimes, indeed, are committed among peo­ <lb/>

            is of any advantage to a commonwealth, and if he who en­ <lb/>
            gages in it with the greatest diligence were to be honourably <lb/>
            distinguished, he would doubtless collect merchants around <lb/>
            him in greater numbers. If, too, it were made known that <lb/>
            he who should discover any new source of revenue for the <lb/>
            state, without detriment to individuals, would receive honour, <lb/>
            neither would this consideration be neglected. 10. And to <lb/>
            say all in one word, if it were made evident, in regard to all <lb/>
            departments of the commonwealth, that he who introduced <lb/>
            anything beneficial would not be unrewarded, the knowledge <lb/>
            of this would incite numbers of people to endeavour to make <lb/>
            useful discoveries ; and when many pay attention to the in­ <lb/>

            thing to recommend respecting mercenary troops, to prevent <lb/>

            inclined to say that a prince who secures the affection of his <lb/>
            subjects has no need of guards ? "</p>
          <p>2. " Nay," replied Simonides, " he will assuredly have need <lb/>
            of them ; for it is natural to men, as it is to horses, to become <lb/>
            more unmanageable the more plentifully they are supplied <lb/>
            with provisions ;1 and the fear of guards will be the more <lb/>
            necessary to keep men in such a condition quiet. 3. To the <lb/>
            virtuous and respectable part of the public, also, it appears tf <lb/>
            me that you can afford greater benefit by no other means than <lb/>
            by the maintenance of a body of mercenaries. 4. You main­ <lb/>
            tain them, indeed, as guards for your own person ; but many <lb/>
            masters have been put to death in past times by their own <lb/>
            dependants ; and if, therefore, it should be one of the chief <lb/>
            charges given to your mercenaries, that they are the guards <lb/>
            of all the citizens, and are to protect all, if they perceive any <lb/>
            such danger threatening them2—and there are, as we all <lb/>
            know, bad characters in every city-if therefore, I say, your <lb/>
            guards were ordered to keep a watchful eye on such charac­ <lb/>
            ters, the citizens in general would feel themselves benefited by <lb/>
            the maintenance of them. 5. In addition to this, your guards <lb/>
            might very well afford security and tranquillity, in a great <lb/>
            measure, to the workmen and cattle in the fields, not only <lb/>
            to your own, but to those throughout the country in general. <lb/>
            They would be in a condition also, by guarding certain advan­ <lb/>
            tageous posts, to secure to the inhabitants freedom from inter­ <lb/>
            ruption, so that they may attend to their proper business. 6. <lb/>
            Besides, who are better fitted to foresee and prevent secret <lb/>
            and sudden incursions of enemies than men who are always <lb/>
            under arms and united in one body ? For taking the field, <lb/>
            too, what can be more beneficial to the citizens than a body of <lb/>
            mercenaries ? for it is natural that they should be in the <lb/>
            highest degree ready to brave toil and danger in defence <lb/>
            of the country. 7. Must it not happen, moreover, that neigh­ <lb/>
            bouring powers will be most desirous of peace with any <lb/>
            country, when it has an armed force constantlyon foot ? for <lb/>
            such a force is eminently able to protect the possessions <lb/>
            of their friends, and to spread destruction among what be- <note type="footnote"> I It is assumed that the state has been made rich by the management <lb/>

            derstand that mercenary troops do no ill to such as do no <lb/>

            do otherwise than contribute with pleasure to their support ? <lb/>
            Private individuals, indeed, often keep guards for objects <lb/>
            of far less moment than these."</p>

          <p>Simonides admonishes Hiero that a sovereign ought to employ his own <lb/>
            private resources as much as possible for the public good, and ought <lb/>
            to exert himself in every way to promote the prosperity of his dominions.</p>
          <p>1. "IT is also incumbent on you, Hiero, not to shrink <lb/>
            from expending a portion of your own private revenue on the <lb/>
            public service ; for it seems to me that what is laid out by a <lb/>
            king for public objects is more advantageously bestowed than <lb/>
            what is spent on his own private account. 2. Let us consider <lb/>
            the point in reference to various particulars. Whether do you <lb/>
            think that to have a palace adorned at an enormous expense. <lb/>
            or to have your whole metropolis furnished with walls, and <lb/>
            temples, and porticoes,1 and market-places, and harbours, <lb/>
            would do you the greater honour ? 3. Or whether would <lb/>
            you appear more formidable to your enemies, when you are <lb/>
            yourself clad in the finest of armour, or when your whole <lb/>
            country is efficiently armed ? 4. In which way do you consider <lb/>
            that your revenues would be rendered greater, by taking <lb/>
            care to make merely your own private property productive, <lb/>
            or by contriving that the property of the whole community <lb/>
            may be productive ? 5. And as to that which is thought <lb/>
            to be the most honourable and noble of occupations, the breed­ <lb/>
            ing of horses for the chariot-race, whether do you think that <lb/>
            you would do yourself the greater honour if you yourself2 <lb/>
            should maintain, and send to the public games, more chariots <note type="footnote"> 1 All the copies have <foreign xml:lang="grc">παραστάσι</foreign>, which means pillars, or perhaps <lb/>

            than any other Greek, or if a greater number of men from <lb/>
            your country than from any other should breed horses and <lb/>
            contend at the games ? Whether do you think it more noble <lb/>
            to gain a victory by the excellence of your own particular <lb/>
            chariot, or through the general prosperity of the city over <lb/>
            which you rule ? 6. I myself, indeed, think it quite unbecom­ <lb/>
            ing to a prince to enter the lists with private individuals ; for <lb/>
            if you are victorious, you will not be admired, but incur <lb/>
            odium, as having extorted the money for your expenses from <lb/>
            the substance of many families ; and if you are unsuccessful, <lb/>
            you will meet with more ridicule than any private individual. <lb/>
            7. I would impress upon you, Hiero, that your proper field of <lb/>
            competition is against the rulers of other states, and if you <lb/>
            exhibit the state that you govern superior in prosperity <lb/>
            to theirs, be assured that you will have triumphed in the <lb/>
            most honourable and noble contest that can arise among man­ <lb/>
            kind. 8. And you will thus, in the first place, secure the love <lb/>
            of your subjects, which you so much desire; and it will not <lb/>
            be one herald only1 that will proclaim your victory, but <lb/>
            all mankind will concur in celebrating your merit. 9. Becom­ <lb/>
            ing an object of attention, you will be loved, not merely by <lb/>
            A few private individuals, but by numbers of whole commu­ <lb/>
            nities, and be admired, not only in your own palace, but <lb/>
            through the whole world. 10. You will then be able to <lb/>
            travel in safety wherever you please, for the purpose of <lb/>
            gratifying your curiosity ; or you may receive such gratifica­ <lb/>
            tion even while you remain at home ; for there will always be <lb/>
            numbers of people around you ready to exhibit whatever they <lb/>
            have discovered that is either ingenious, or beautiful, or <lb/>
            useful, and of such as will be desirous to gratify yoU.2 11, <lb/>

            lighted at your prosperity, and ready to contend for what <lb/>
            is yours as earnestly as for what is their own. 13. You will <lb/>
            consider all the wealth belonging to your friends as treasures <lb/>
            laid up for your own use. Enrich then your friends without <lb/>

            <title type="sub">INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>OF <unclear>me</unclear> philosophy of Socrates, as transmitted to us by Xenophon, <lb/>
            it is not the object to investigate the causes, or ascertain the origins, <lb/>
            of divine and human things, but, by teaching what is good and <lb/>
            honourable, to fit men, individually, for attaining happiness in life, <lb/>
            and to instruct communities how to secure prosperity. There are, <lb/>
            accordingly, two principal parts of the Socratic philosophy: the <lb/>
            ethic, which shows what course of conduct every person must pursue <lb/>
            in order to gain a character for virtue and honour; and the political, <lb/>
            which teaches by what means individuals may advance a com­ <lb/>
            munity to the highest state of excellence. But as the master of a <lb/>
            family and his household constitute, as it were, a smaller com­ <lb/>
            munity in the midst of a greater, and as the prosperity of the <lb/>
            whole state depends on the proper management of each particular <lb/>
            family, a third part, the ceconomic, is added.</p>
          <p>The first author that wrote of ethics, politics, and œconomics, <lb/>
            in distinct and separate treatises, was Aristotle. As for Plato, <lb/>
            who says that we cannot conceive of virtue or merit in a man <lb/>
            or master of a family, unless as subject to the laws of his <lb/>
            community, he has included all those three parts of moral <lb/>
            philosophy in one book, which he has entitled his " Republic." But <lb/>
            it was Xenophon that laid the foundation of this triple division ; <lb/>
            for in his " Memorabilia " he makes it his object to show the whole <lb/>
            scope of the moral teaching of Socrates (though in that work <lb/>
             <pb n="72"/>
            there is much that relates rather to political or œconomical <lb/>
            science); in the " Cyropædia" he illustrates a part of political <lb/>
            science; and in the present treatise he discusses œconomy or <lb/>
            domestic management.</p>
          <p>The dialogue in this book, unlike those in the " Memorabilia," is <lb/>
            written in a certain regular method, and consists of parts carefully <lb/>
            put together. We see that the whole work is purposely divided <lb/>
            into two parts. The first, which contains a conversation of Socra­ <lb/>
            tes with Critobulus, is in place of an introduction, and prepares <lb/>
            the reader for what is to follow; the other, which is a dialogue <lb/>
            between Ischomachus and Socrates, sets forth the precepts intend­ <lb/>
            ed to be given concerning the management of a family.</p>
          <p>The simple and graceful facility in discussing a subject which <lb/>
            we know to have been peculiar, not to the Socrates represented in <lb/>
            Plato, but to the Socrates that really lived, is exhibited as clearly in <lb/>
            the " (Economicus " as in any of Xenophon's other writings. Cicero <lb/>
            thought it worthy of being translated into Latin. Breitenbach</p>
          <p>A few other remarks on the " (Economicus " may be seen in the <lb/>
            Biographical Notice of Xenophon," prefixed to the preceding <lb/>
            volume.</p><pb n="73"/>

          <p>Socrates teaches Critobulus that œconomy is an art which is shown in the <lb/>
            management of households and estates, whether our own or those of <lb/>
            others; that goods are whatever a person may use in such a way as to <lb/>
            gain advantage from them ; and that if some meet with loss instead of <lb/>
            profit from the use of them, the fault lies in their own misconduct.</p>
          <p>1. I ONCE heard Socrates1 also discoursing on the manage­ <lb/>
            ment of a household, after the following manner : " Tell me," <lb/>
            said he, " Critobulus,2 is domestic management the name of an <lb/>
            art, as that of healing, or of working in brass, or of building? <lb/>
            " It appears so to me," said Critobulus. 2. And as we can <lb/>
            specify concerning these arts, what is the business of each, <lb/>
            can we also specify concerning domestic management, what <lb/>
            is its business ? " " It appears, at least," said Critobulus, <lb/>
            " that it is the business of a good householder to regulate his <note type="footnote"> ' "<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ηκουσα δέ</foreign> iron <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτου̃</foreign>. Xenophon commences thus in allusion to <lb/>
            what he had previously written concerning Socrates. He begins all <lb/>
            his works thus abruptly, and without preface, except the Cyropædia and <lb/>
            the treatise de Re Equestri. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Critobulus the son of Crito, a very rich man, was one of the familiar <lb/>
            associates of Socrates, as appears not only from this book, especially <lb/>
            c. 3, sect. 7, but from Mem. Soc. ii. 6 ; i. 3. 8, and from the Symposium, <lb/>
            especially c 4, sect. 27 Breitenbach. </note> <pb n="74"/>

            house well." 3. And as to another man's house," said <lb/>
            Socrates, " if the owner should intrust it to him, might he <lb/>
            not be able, if he pleased, to regulate it as well as his own ? <lb/>
            He who is skilled in building can do for another equally well <lb/>
            what he can do for himself; and surely he who is skilled in <lb/>
            domestic management may act similarly." " It appears so to <lb/>
            me, Socrates." 4. "Is it possible then," said, Socrates, "for <lb/>
            one who knows this art, and happens to have no property of <lb/>
            his own, to earn money by managing the house of another, as <lb/>
            an architect earns money by building a house ?" " Yes, <lb/>
            doubtless," said Critobulus, " he might earn a large sum of <lb/>
            money, if, taking a house under his charge, he can fulfil the <lb/>
            duties which it requires and augment the value of it by <lb/>
            adding largely to its resources."</p>
          <p>5. " But what is it that the term house gives us to under­ <lb/>
            stand ? Is it the same as the mere building, or is whatever a <lb/>
            man possesses, besides the mere building, included under the <lb/>
            term house ?" " It seems to me," replied Critobulus, <lb/>
            " that everything a person has, even though it be not in the <lb/>
            same country with the possessor, is comprehended under the <lb/>
            term house,1 or personal property." 6. "Have not, then, some <lb/>
            persons enemies ?" " Certainly ; some have very many." <lb/>
            " Shall we, therefore, say that enemies are the property of <lb/>
            those persons ? ” “ It would be ridiculous," answered Cri­ <lb/>
            tobulus, “ if a person who increases the enemies of another, <lb/>
            should receive pay for increasing them." "I asked the ques­ <lb/>
            tion," said Socrates, " because it seemed settled between us <lb/>
            that a man's house, or estate, is whatever he has." "As­ <lb/>
            suredly," returned Critobulus, "whatever good a man has <lb/>
            is his property, or a portion of his goods ; but, by Jupiter, if <lb/>
            he has anything hurtful, I do not reckon it among his goods."</p>
          <p>7. " You seem, then," said Socrates, " to mean by goods <lb/>
            something serviceable to the owner." "Most certainly," re­ <lb/>
            joined Critobulus; "for what does him injury I regard as <lb/>
            a nuisance, rather than a part of his goods." 8. If, then, <lb/>
            a man buy a horse,2 and does not know how to manage him, <lb/>
            but falls off him, and receives some injury, is the horse not a <lb/>
            part of his goods ? ” " Not if goods are something service- <note type="footnote">1 <unclear>Olzoς</unclear>, in the sense of estate, or personal property. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 See Mem. Soc. ii. 3. 7. </note> <pb n="75"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="§ 9-14.]"/> <lb/>
            able." "Neither, then, is land part of a man's goods, if he <lb/>
            cultivates it in such a manner as to suffer by its cultivation." <lb/>
            "Land certainly cannot be called part of a man's goods, if, <lb/>
            instead of supporting him, it brings him nothing but hunger."</p>
          <p>9. " So, then, with regard to sheep, if a man, from not know­ <lb/>
            ing how to manage sheep, suffers loss. by keeping them, the <lb/>
            sheep would not be a portion of his goods." " It seems to me <lb/>
            that they would not." " You, then, as it appears, consider <lb/>
            goods as what is profitable; but what is hurtful you do not con­ <lb/>
            sider as goods." "Exactly so."</p>
          <p>10. “ The same things, then," continued Socrates, " are goods <lb/>
            to him who knows how to make use of them, but not goods to <lb/>
            him who does not know ; thus flutes will be goods to him <lb/>
            who knows how to play properly upon them, but to him who <lb/>
            does not know they will no more be goods than worthless <lb/>
            pebbles are goods; unless indeed he sells them." 11. " So it <lb/>
            appears to me," rejoined Critobulus, " that flutes will be <lb/>
            goods to those who are ignorant of their use, if they sell them, <lb/>
            but not while they merely possess them ; and thus our reason­ <lb/>
            ing proceeds consistently, since it was laid down that goods <lb/>
            are what is serviceable ; for to such persons as those to whom <lb/>
            we alluded, flutes are not goods (since they are of no service), <lb/>
            but, when sold, become goods." 12. To this Socrates rejoined, <lb/>
            " If indeed the owner knows how to sell them ; but if lie sells <lb/>
            them to another person who does not know how to use them, <lb/>
            they will not be goods even when they are sold, according to <lb/>
            your reasoning." “You appear to intimate, that not even <lb/>
            money itself is to be reckoned among a person's goods, unless <lb/>
            he knows how to use it." 13. " And you appear to agree <lb/>
            with me, when you say that goods are things by which a per­ <lb/>
            son may be profited. If, for example, a man should make use <lb/>
            of his money to get a mistress, and should, by her means, <lb/>
            bring himself into a worse condition, bodily, mentally, and in <lb/>
            his household affairs, how could it be said that his money was <lb/>
            at all profitable to him ?" " By no means ; unless indeed we <lb/>
            say that hyoscyamus, as it is called, is a profitable article to <lb/>
            possess, a herb of which those who eat are driven mad." <lb/>
            " Money, then, if its possessor does not know how to use it, <lb/>
            may be thus excluded, Critobulus, from being numbered <lb/>
            among goods.</p>
          <p>14 "But as to friends," continued Socrates, "if a person <pb n="76"/>
            <note type="margin"> [CH. 1. </note> <lb/>
            knows how to use them, so as to receive profit from them, what <lb/>
            shall we say that they are ?" " Goods, by Jupiter," said <lb/>
            Critobulus, " and much more so than oxen, if at least they are <lb/>
            more serviceable than oxen." 15. "Enemies also, then, accord­ <lb/>
            ing to your argument, are goods to him who is able to extract <lb/>
            profit from enemies." " It appears so to me." " It is the part <lb/>
            of a good manager of property, then, to know how to deal with <lb/>
            his enemies in such a way as to derive profit from them." <lb/>
            " Most certainly." " True; for you see, my dear Critobulus, <lb/>
            how many families, as well of private individuals as of princes, <lb/>
            have been improved in condition oy war."</p>
          <p>16. " This point seems to me to be very well settled, <lb/>
            Socrates," said Critobulus ; “ but what can we think when we <lb/>
            see persons who have knowledge and resources by which they <lb/>
            might with exertion improve their property, but perceive that <lb/>
            they are unwilling to do so, and that their qualifications are <lb/>
            in consequence of no profit to them ? Can we say anything <lb/>
            else than that their qualifications are not goods to them, not <lb/>
            even possessions of the least value ?" 17. “ Do you mean to <lb/>
            speak of slaves, my dear Critobulus?" said Socrates. " Not I <lb/>
            indeed, by Jove," replied he; " but there are some among those <lb/>
            who are esteemed noble, of whom I see that part are acquaint­ <lb/>
            ed with the arts of war, and part with those of peace, which <lb/>
            arts, however, they will not exercise, because, as I suppose, <lb/>
            they are without masters to compel them." is. " How can <lb/>
            they be without masters," said Socrates, " when, desiring to <lb/>
            prosper, and wishing to do something from which they may <lb/>
            derive profit, they are still hindered from doing so by those <lb/>
            who rule them ? " " And who are they that rule them," asked <lb/>
            Critobulus, "for they are nowhere to be seen?" 19. By <lb/>
            Jove," replied Socrates, " they are so far from being nowhere <lb/>
            to be seen, that they may be seen everywhere; and that they <lb/>
            are most pernicious rulers, is well known to yourself, if you <lb/>
            believe idleness, and effeminacy of mind, and carelessness, <lb/>
            to be vices. 20. There are also certain deceitful mistresses <lb/>
            that sway them, pretending to be goddesses of pleasure, such <lb/>
            as gaming and frivolous social gratifications, which, in process <lb/>
            of time, make it evident even to the victims of their decep­ <lb/>
            tions that they are but pains disguised in the garb of plea­ <lb/>
            sures ; and these, through their influence over their votaries. <lb/>
            prevent them from applying to useful occupations." 21. " Yet <pb n="77"/>
            <note type="margin"> § 22. 23.] </note> <lb/>
            others, Socrates," said Critobulus, " are not hindered by such <lb/>
            tyrants from exerting themselves, but apply with the utmost <lb/>
            vigour to work, and to contrive means of increasing their in­ <lb/>
            comes ; and nevertheless they waste their property, and become <lb/>
            involved in difficulties." 22. " So it iS , said Socrates, " for <lb/>
            these also are slaves, and slaves of extremely troublesome <lb/>
            mistresses, some being devoted to the luxuries of the table, <lb/>
            some to licentiousness, some to intoxication, some to foolish and <lb/>
            expensive objects of ambition, which exercise such cruel sway <lb/>
            over those whom they get under their power, that, as long as <lb/>
            they see them in vigour and able to work, they compel them to <lb/>
            bring whatever they gain to expend upon their desires ; but <lb/>
            when they find them unable to work, through old age, they leave <lb/>
            them to spend their declining days in misery, and endeavour to <lb/>
            make slaves of others. 23. But we ought to fight for our <lb/>
            liberty against such tyrants, Critobulus, not less strenuously <lb/>
            than against those who endeavour to enslave us by arms. <lb/>
            Enemies in war, who are honourable and generous, have <lb/>
            obliged many nations, after they have subdued them, to im­ <lb/>
            prove in character under the influence of gentle correction, <lb/>
            and have led them to pass the rest of their lives in greater <lb/>
            comfort; but tyrannical passions never cease to harass the <lb/>
            bodies and minds and estates of men, as long as1 they exer­ <lb/>
            cise any influence over them."</p>

          <p>Critobulus requesting to be taught by what means he may increase his pro­ <lb/>
            perty, which fortune had granted him in sufficient abundance, Socrates <lb/>
            jocosely replies that he himself was rich, and Critobulus very poor, an as­ <lb/>
            sertion which he proceeds to prove. Being again asked to give some instruc­ <lb/>
            tion on the management of an estate, he says that he is inexperienced in <lb/>
            such matters, but offers to refer Critobulus to certain persons who are <lb/>
            skilled in them,</p>
          <p>1. AFTER these observations of Socrates, Critobulus spoke <lb/>
            to the following effect: “ On such points I think that what I <note type="footnote"> 1 ”<foreign xml:lang="grc">Εστ' ἂν</foreign>.] It signifies not only donee, usque dum, but also quamdiu. <lb/>

            have heard from you is extremely satisfactory; but when I <lb/>
            examine myself, I seem to feel convinced that I am sufficiently <lb/>
            master over such inclinations ; so that if you would advise me <lb/>
            by what course of conduct I may improve my domestic re­ <lb/>
            sources, I do not think that I should be impeded by the seduc­ <lb/>
            tions of those tyrannical mistresses, as you call them. Impart <lb/>
            to me confidently, therefore, whatever good admonitions you <lb/>
            have to give. Or do you accuse us,1 my dear Socrates, of <lb/>
            being wealthy enough ? and do we appear to you to have no <lb/>
            need of additional riches ? "</p>
          <p>2. " If you speak of me as well as yourself, then," said <lb/>
            Socrates, “ I consider that I require no addition to my means, <lb/>
            but am rich enough already ; you, however, Critobulus, ap­ <lb/>
            pear to me to be extremely poor, and, by Jupiter, I some­ <lb/>
            times feel very great pity for you." 3. “ And how much," <lb/>
            rejoined Critobulus with a laugh, “ how much, in the name of <lb/>
            the gods, my dear Socrates, do you think that your property <lb/>
            would fetch if it were sold, and how much mine ? " "I think," <lb/>
            replied Socrates, " that if I found a good purchaser, my whole <lb/>
            property, with my house, would very readily bring me five <lb/>
            minæ ;2 yours, I am very certain, would fetch a hundred times <lb/>
            as much." 4. " Then, when you know this, do you think that <lb/>
            you have no need of more money, and pity me as being poor ? ” <lb/>
            " Yes," said he, “ for what I have is sufficient to supply me <lb/>
            with all that I need ; but for the splendour with which you <lb/>
            are surrounded, and to keep up your dignity, not even if thrice <lb/>
            as much as what you have were bestowed upon you, would you <lb/>
            appear to me to have enough." “ How so ?" asked Crito­ <lb/>
            bulus. 5. " Because, in the first place," said Socrates, in ex <lb/>
            planation, " I see that a necessity is imposed on you of offer­ <lb/>
            ing many great sacrifices, or, I suppose, neither gods nor men <lb/>
            would be satisfied with you; in the next place, you must en­ <lb/>
            tertain many strangers, and entertain them magnificently ; and <lb/>
            in addition, you have to give feasts, and make presents to your <lb/>
            fellow-servants, or find yourself destitute of friends. 6. I <lb/>
            observe also that the s-tate requires of you to be at great ex- <note type="footnote">1 ”H <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατέγνωκας</foreign> Critobulus is speaking of himself only; and <lb/>

            and to pursue the humorous discussion that follows. Breitenlach. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 About fifteen pounds of our money. </note> <pb n="79"/>

            penses in keeping horses,1 in exhibiting theatrical entertain­ <lb/>
            ments,2 in presiding over the gymnasia,3 in discharging the <lb/>
            duties of a patron ; and if a war should arise, I am quite sure <lb/>
            that they will lay upon you, in your office of trierarch,4 so <lb/>
            much to pay for men to serve, and other contributions, that <lb/>
            you will not easily meet the requirements ; and should you be <lb/>
            thought to discharge any of your duties inefficiently, I am quite <lb/>
            certain that the Athenians will punish you not less severely <lb/>
            than if they found you robbing their treasury. 7. In addition <lb/>
            to this, I see that you fancy yourself rich, and are but little <lb/>
            disposed to use means for getting money ; and that you devote <lb/>
            your attention to matters of amusement,5 as having a right to <lb/>
            do so. For these reasons I feel compassion for you, fearing <lb/>
            that you may fall into some irremediable misfortunes, and be <lb/>
            reduced to great poverty, s. As for myself, even if I were <lb/>
            in want, you are aware, I am sure, that there are persons who <lb/>
            would assist me ; so far that, even if each contributed but <lb/>
            very little, they would drown my humble means in a flood of <lb/>
            abundance ; but your friends, even though they have ampler <lb/>
            means for supporting their condition than you have for sup­ <lb/>
            porting yours, nevertheless look to you as if to receive bene­ <lb/>
            fits from you."</p>
          <p>9. " Against these observations, my dear Socrates," said <lb/>
            Critobulus, " I have nothing to say ; but it is now time for <lb/>
            you to act the patron towards me, and prevent me from be­ <lb/>
            coming pitiable in reality." Socrates, on hearing this, said, <note type="footnote">1 It was customary at Athens for the richer sort of citizens to keep <lb/>
            horses for chariot-races or for sacred processions. See Xen. Hipp. c. 1, <lb/>
            sect. It. The old man in the Clouds of Aristophanes laments that his <lb/>

            puerorum amans (Mem. Soc. ii. 6. 29), and is introduced in the Symposium, <lb/>
            c. 4, sect. 12, as captivated, though but recently married, with the attrac­ <lb/>
            tions of Clinias. As the Symposium of Callias took place probably about <lb/>
            Olymp. xciii. 3, we may suppose that this dialogue between Socrates and <lb/>
            Critobulus was held not very long after that date, though it may be infer­ <lb/>
            red from c. 3, sect. 13, that he had lived some years in the matrimonial <lb/>
            state. Breitenbach. </note> <pb n="80"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[CH. 2."/><lb/>
            ” Do you not think, Critobulus, that you are acting very <lb/>
            strangely, since, when I said a little while ago that I was rich, <lb/>
            you laughed at me, as if I did not know what riches were, <lb/>
            and did not cease till you had convinced me, and obliged me <lb/>
            to acknowledge that I have not the hundredth part of what <lb/>
            you have ; and now you desire me to be your patron, and take <lb/>
            care that you may not be reduced to utter and undeniable <lb/>
            poverty." 10. " It is because I see that you, Socrates, know <lb/>
            one thing relating to riches, namely, how to keep a surplus; <lb/>
            and I expect, accordingly, that he who has something over <lb/>
            out of a little will easily produce a large superabundance out <lb/>
            of much." 11. " Do you not remember, then, that just now,1 <lb/>
            in the course of our conversation, when you would not allow <lb/>
            me the liberty even of putting in a syllable, you said that <lb/>
            horses were not goods to him who did not know how to use <lb/>
            horses, nor land, nor cattle, nor money, nor anything else, <lb/>
            that a person did not know how to use ? Profit, indeed, is <lb/>
            derived from such possessions ; but how do you think that I <lb/>
            can know how to use any of those things of which I never <lb/>
            owned even a single one ? " 12. " Yet it seemed to me that <lb/>
            even if a person had no money, there might nevertheless be <lb/>
            in him some knowledge of household management; and what <lb/>
            then hinders you from having such knowledge ?" "The very <lb/>
            same thing, assuredly, that would hinder a man from knowing <lb/>
            how to play on the flute, if he has never been in possession of <lb/>
            any flutes of his own, and no other person has allowed him <lb/>
            to learn by playing upon his. 13. Such is the case with me <lb/>
            in respect to the management of household property ; for I <lb/>
            have never been myself in possession of any property of my <lb/>
            own, as a means of learning, nor has any other person ever <lb/>
            offered me his to manage, except that you now express a <lb/>
            desire to intrust me with yours. But consider that those who <lb/>
            are learning to play on the harp spoil their harps at first; <lb/>
            and in like manner I, if I were to attempt to learn the man­ <lb/>
            agement of property by making experiments on yours, might <lb/>
            perhaps bring all your possessions to nothing."</p>
          <p>14. To this Critobulus replied, " You are strenuously en­ <lb/>
            deavouring to escape, Socrates, from giving me any assistance <lb/>
            to sustain my necessary business with greater ease." " No, by <lb/>
            Jupiter," rejoined Socrates, " not I; for I will most willingly <note type="footnote"> 1 C. 1 sect. 8. </note> <pb n="81"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="§ 15—18.]"/> <lb/>
            communicate to you whatever I can. 15. But I think, at the <lb/>
            same time, that if you had come to me for fire, and if, having <lb/>
            none myself, I had directed you to a place where you would <lb/>
            get it, you would not have blamed me. Or, if you asked <lb/>
            water of me when I had none, and I directed you whither to go <lb/>
            for it, I know that you would not have found fault with me for <lb/>
            doing so. Or if you wished to learn music from me, and I <lb/>
            mentioned to you persons who were far more skilful in music <lb/>
            than myself, and would be thankful to you for taking lessons <lb/>
            from them, what objection would you make to my acting in <lb/>
            such a manner?" " I should be able to make no reasonable <lb/>
            objection," my dear Socrates. 16. "I shall therefore point out <lb/>
            to you, Critobulus, other persons much better skilled than my­ <lb/>
            self in the matters which you are solicitous to learn from me; <lb/>
            for I admit that it has been an object with me to discover <lb/>
            which of the people in the city are the most skilful in their <lb/>
            several pursuits; 17. since, observing that of those who were <lb/>
            engaged in the same occupations, some were in the greatest <lb/>
            poverty, and others extremely rich, I wondered, and thought it <lb/>
            an inquiry worthy of consideration to discover what the cause <lb/>
            was. 18. Examining into matters, accordingly, I found that <lb/>
            affairs took a perfectly natural course; for I saw that those <lb/>
            who did their business heedlessly suffered for their misconduct, <lb/>
            while I learned that those who applied to their duties with <lb/>
            steadiness and judgment,1 despatched them with greater <lb/>
            expedition, and ease, and profit. By learning, therefore, if you <lb/>
            think proper, from such persons, I consider that, if the gods <lb/>
            are not unfavourable to you, you may become a very able <lb/>
            man of business." <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τνωμη̃ συνταμένῃ</foreign>.] Intento ammo. Some copies have <foreign xml:lang="grc">συντε­ <lb/>

          <p>Critobulus still urges Socrates to give him instruction how to improve his <lb/>
            property; and Socrates recommends him to study the conduct of those <lb/>
            who have managed their business with judgment and to advantage. He <lb/>
            reminds him how many have prospered, or come to poverty, by different <lb/>
            courses of proceeding. He offers to introduce him to skilful professors of <lb/>
            other arts besides that of agriculture.</p>
          <p>1. CRITOBULUS, on hearing these observations, said, " Now, <lb/>
            ny dear Socrates, I will never let you go until you have made <lb/>
            Known to me what you have promised me in the presence of <lb/>
            our friends here."1 " What if I should show you, then, <lb/>
            Critobulus, first of all," said Socrates,“ that some people build <lb/>
            useless houses at very great expense, and that others, at much <lb/>
            less expense, construct houses having every convenience, shall <lb/>
            I not be thought to have shown you one of the great concerns <lb/>
            of household management ? " " Certainly," replied Critobulus. <lb/>
            2. " And what if I should show you, after this, that which is <lb/>
            naturally consequent upon it, that some people who possess <lb/>
            abundance of household necessaries of all kinds have it not in <lb/>
            their power to use them, nor even know whether they are in <lb/>
            safety, and on tnis account suffer great annoyance themselves, <lb/>
            and cause great annoyance to their servants, while others, who <lb/>
            have not more furniture, but even far less, have whatever <lb/>
            they want always ready for use." 3. "Is anything else, then, <lb/>
            the cause of this, Socrates, than that with the one class of <lb/>
            persons everything is thrown down as chance may direct, <lb/>
            while with the others everything is kept arranged in its place?" <lb/>
            " Such is the case assuredly," said Socrates, " and their things <lb/>
            are arranged, not in a place chosen at hazard, but where pro­ <lb/>
            priety suggests." " You seem to speak of this also," said <lb/>
            Critobulus, " as an element in the knowledge of household <lb/>
            management." 4. " What, again, if I should show you," con­ <lb/>
            tinued Socrates, "that in some places all the slaves are tied up, <lb/>
            so to speak, and yet frequently run away, while in other places <note type="footnote">1 Socrates was constantly attended by some of his friends, who wished <lb/>
            to gather instruction from his discourse; and we must not be surprised <lb/>
            that they took no part in many of the dialogues at which they were pre­ <lb/>
            sent. Thus Xenophon, at the beginning of this book, and in several <lb/>
            passages of the Memorabilia, signifies that he was present at conversations <lb/>
            of Socrates, but records no observations of his own. Weiske. </note> <pb n="83"/>

            they are left at liberty, and are willing alike to work and to <lb/>
            stay with their masters, should I not be thought, in mentioning <lb/>
            this, to bring to your notice something worthy of regard in <lb/>
            household management ? " " Yes, by Jupiter," replied Crito­ <lb/>
            bulus, “ something extremely worthy of regard." 5. " <unclear>An</unclear> <lb/>
            what if I show you that of those who cultivate similar land, <lb/>
            some complain that they are utterly ruined and starved by <lb/>
            their farming, while others have everything that they want in <lb/>
            abundance and excellence ?” “ Such is indeed the case," <lb/>
            said Critobulus; "for perhaps the first sort of agriculturists <lb/>
            spend their money not merely on objects that are necessary, <lb/>
            but on such as bring destruction alike on the master and on <lb/>
            his estate." 6. "Perchance there are some such," said Socrates; <lb/>
            ” but I do not now speak of them, but of persons who, profess­ <lb/>
            ing to practise agriculture, cannot command resources even <lb/>
            for their necessary expenditure." "And what is the cause of <lb/>
            this, Socrates ? " said Critobulus. " I will bring you among <lb/>
            them," answered Socrates, " and you shall understand by see­ <lb/>
            ing for yourself." " Very well," replied Critobulus, " If, at <lb/>
            least, I can."</p>
          <p>7. " It is therefore very proper," proceeded Socrates, " that <lb/>
            you should examine yourself, to ascertain whether you will <lb/>
            be able to understand. I have known you 1 rise very early in <lb/>
            the morning, and go a very long way, to see actors in comedy, <lb/>
            and I have heard you press me very strongly to go with you <lb/>
            to the exhibition; but you never invited me to such a sight <lb/>
            as that of which I am speaking." "Doubtless therefore, my <lb/>
            dear Socrates, I appear ridiculous to you." 8. "But to yourself, <lb/>
            by Jupiter, you ought to appear far more ridiculous. Sup­ <lb/>
            posing I show that some men, by keeping horses, have been <lb/>
            reduced to the want even of necessaries, while others, by the <lb/>
            same means, become very wealthy, and exult in their gains ? " <lb/>
            "I see such persons myself, and know men of both sorts, yet <lb/>
            I am not at all the more in the number of those who get <lb/>
            gain ? " 9. ” No; for you look at them as you look at actors <lb/>
            in tragedy and comedy, not, as I think, that you may become <lb/>
            a poet, but that you may find pleasure from seeing and hearing. <lb/>

            you not think that you act foolishly, if you do not study not <lb/>
            to be quite ignorant of that occupation, especially when horses <lb/>
            are both good to use and profitable to sell? " 10. Do you <lb/>
            wish me to become a colt-breaker, my dear Socrates ? “ " By <lb/>
            no means, any more than to bring up farm-labourers by buy­ <lb/>
            ing them when children. But there are certain ages, as well <lb/>
            of horses as of men, which are immediately profitable, and <lb/>
            advance in improvement. I can also show that some men <lb/>
            have so managed their wives, as to find in them fellow-helpers <lb/>
            in improving their fortunes, whilst others have dealt with <lb/>
            them in such a way that they have in a great degree ruined <lb/>
            them." 11. " But in these cases, my dear Socrates, ought we to <lb/>
            blame the husband or the wife ? " " If a sheep," replied <lb/>
            Socrates, " is in ill condition, we generally blame the shepherd; <lb/>
            if a horse is mischievous, we impute the fault to the groom; <lb/>
            and as to a wife, if, after being taught what is right, she con­ <lb/>
            ducts herself badly, perhaps she ought justly to bear the blame; <lb/>
            but if her husband does not teach her what is right and <lb/>
            proper, but exacts service from her while she is ignorant of <lb/>
            what she ought to do, would he not justly be visited with <lb/>
            condemnation? 12. But by all means tell us the truth, Critobu­ <lb/>
            lus (for we are all friends who are here), is there any one tc <lb/>
            whom you intrust a greater number of important affairs than <lb/>
            to your wife ?" ” There is no one," replied Critobulus. <lb/>
            ” And is there any one with whom you hold fewer discus­ <lb/>
            sions than with your wife?" " If there is any one, there <lb/>
            are certainly not many.“1 13. " Did you marry her when <lb/>
            she was quite young, or, at least, when she had seen and <lb/>
            heard as little of things as was well possible?" "Certainly <lb/>
            I did." " It would then be much more surprising, if she knew <lb/>
            anything of what she ought to say or do, than if she fell into <lb/>
            mistakes." 14. " But as to those who, you say, have had <lb/>
            good wives, my dear Socrates, did they themselves instruct <lb/>
            them ? " ” There is nothing like looking at examples;2 and <lb/>

            prosperity. Resources come into the house for the most part <lb/>
            by the exertions of the husband, but the larger portion of <lb/>
            them is expended under the management of the wife, and, if <lb/>
            affairs be well ordered, the estate is improved; but if they are <lb/>
            conducted badly, the property is diminished. 16. I think <lb/>
            that I could also point out to you, if you think it requisite, <lb/>
            persons skilled in other arts, who practise each of them with <lb/>

          <p>Critobulus declines to learn more pursuits than one; and Socrates approves <lb/>
            of his resolution. Sedentary and indoor occupations debilitate the mind <lb/>
            and body. Military or agricultural pursuits seem to be the only ones <lb/>
            suited for Critobulus; Socrates supports them by the example of the <lb/>
            king of Persia. An anecdote of Cyrus the Younger and Lysander.</p>
          <p>1. " BUT what occasion is there for you, ray dear Socrates," <lb/>
            asked Critobulus, " to call my attention to all kinds of arts ? <lb/>
            for neither is it easy to procure persons who practise all sorts <lb/>
            of arts competently, nor is it possible for any single individual <lb/>
            to become skilled in all; but in regard to those which are <lb/>
            thought most honourable, and which would be most becoming <lb/>
            to me if I practised them, give me some information concern­ <lb/>
            ing them and the persons who are engaged in them; and while <lb/>
            you instruct me, assist me yourself, as far as you can, to <lb/>
            understand." 2. " You say well, Critobulus," replied Socrates; <lb/>
            " for those arts which are called handicrafts are objection <lb/>
            able,1 and are indeed justly held in little repute in communities; <lb/>
            for they weaken the bodies of those who work at them or <lb/>
            attend to them, by compelling them to sit and to live indoors; <lb/>
            some of them, too, to pass whole days by the fire; and when <lb/>
            the body becomes effeminate, the mind loses its strength. <note type="footnote"> think that she is mentioned as an instructress ironically. See Weiske's <lb/>

            3. Such mechanical occupations also, as they are termed, leave <lb/>
            those who practise them no leisure to attend to the interests of <lb/>
            their friends or the commonwealth; so that men of that class <lb/>
            seem unsuited alike to be of advantage to their connexions, <lb/>
            and to be defenders of their country. In some states, indeed, <lb/>
            and especially in such as seem excellent in war, no citizen is <lb/>
            allowed to engage in these handicraft employments."</p>
          <p>4. "In what sort of employments then, Socrates, would you <lb/>
            recommend me to engage ?" asked Critobulus. " Ought we <lb/>
            to be ashamed," replied Socrates, " to imitate the king of the <lb/>
            Persians ? For they say that he considers the art of agricul­ <lb/>
            ture, and that of war, to be among the most honourable and <lb/>
            necessary occupations, and pays the greatest attention to both <lb/>
            of them." 5. Critobulus, on hearing this, said, " Do you then, <lb/>
            my dear Socrates, believe that the king of the Persians unites <lb/>
            the pursuit of husbandry with the other objects of his care ?” <lb/>
            “ If we consider the matter, Critobulus, in the following <lb/>
            manner, we may perhaps satisfy ourselves whether he gives <lb/>
            it any portion of his attention. We are all aware that he at­ <lb/>
            tends diligently to military affairs, because, from whatever <lb/>
            nations he receives tribute, he has appointed to the governors <lb/>
            of them respectively for how many horsemen, and bowmen, <lb/>
            and slingers, and targeteers each must furnish maintenance, a <lb/>
            number that may be sufficient to keep the people under his <lb/>
            command in awe, and serve as defenders to the country if <lb/>
            enemies invade it. 6. In addition to these troops, the king <lb/>
            maintains garrisons in the several fortresses; and the govern­ <lb/>
            or, to whom the commission is given, furnishes pay for these <lb/>
            garrisons; while the king holds a review every year of the <lb/>
            mercenaries and other forces that are required to appear in <lb/>
            arms, collecting them all together, except the troops in garri­ <lb/>
            son, in the place where they are ordered to assemble, when he <lb/>
            himself inspects those that are near his own residence, and sends <lb/>
            trustworthy officers to view such as are at a distance. 7. And <lb/>
            whatever commanders of garrisons, captains of thousands, and <lb/>
            satraps,l are found to have the required complement of troops, <lb/>
            and exhibit them equipped with proper horses and arms, he <lb/>
            distinguishes such governors with honours, and enriches them <note type="footnote">1 The difference between these three kind of officers may be understood <lb/>
            by a reference to Cyrop. viii. 6. 1 and 3. Schneider. The commander <lb/>
            of garisons and captains of thousands were subject to the satraps </note> <pb n="87"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="§ 8-11.] "/>with valuable presents; but such of the governors as he finds <lb/>
            either neglecting the garrisons, or guilty of peculation, he <lb/>
            punishes with great severity, degrading them from their posts, <lb/>
            and putting other officers in their places. To military affairs, <lb/>
            therefore, as he pursues such a course of conduct, we must <lb/>
            unquestionably allow that he pays great attention. 8. But, <lb/>
            besides, whatever part of his dominions he rides through and <lb/>
            surveys in person, he observes the condition of it; and what­ <lb/>
            ever part he does not inspect in person, he ascertains the state <lb/>
            of it by sending thither trustworthy commissioners ; and to <lb/>
            such of the satraps as he finds exhibit their provinces well <lb/>
            inhabited, with the soil well cultivated, and stocked with trees <lb/>
            and fruits such as the ground is fitted to produce, he gives <lb/>
            additional territory, graces them with presents, and distinguish­ <lb/>
            es them with seats of honour; but such as he finds to have <lb/>
            their provinces ill cultivated, or thinly inhabited, whether <lb/>
            through their harsh treatment of the people, or through ty­ <lb/>
            ranny or neglect, he punishes and deprives of their commands, <lb/>
            and appoints others in their room. 9. Acting thus, does he <lb/>
            seem to have less care that his land may be well cultivated <lb/>
            by the inhabitants, than that it may be well defended by his <lb/>
            garrisons ? There are indeed officers appointed by him for <lb/>
            both purposes; but not the same; for some overlook the in­ <lb/>
            habitants and tillers of the ground, and collect tribute from <lb/>
            them, and others have charge of the armed forces. 10. And <lb/>
            if the overseer of the forces does not sufficiently protect the <lb/>
            provinces, the overseer of the inhabitants and tillers of the <lb/>
            ground brings an accusation against him, representing that the <lb/>
            people cannot cultivate the land for want of proper protection; <lb/>
            but if, while the overseer of the forces secures peace to the <lb/>
            cultivators, the other overseer occasions the provinces to be <lb/>
            thin of people and ill cultivated, the overseer of the forces, <lb/>
            on his part, lays an accusation against him. 11. For those <lb/>
            who cultivate the ground inefficiently will neither maintain <lb/>
            the garrisons, nor be able to pay their tribute. But when a <lb/>
            satrap is appointed, he attends to both these objects." 1 <note type="footnote">1 To the payment of troops in the garrisons and the payment of tribute <lb/>
            to the king. " We see," says Breitenbach., “ that the satrap, as described <lb/>

            viii. 6. 1; and that there was in every province an <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂρχων</foreign> or governor <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[CH. 4."/> <lb/>
            12. " If the king, then," rejoined Critobulus, " acts in this <lb/>
            manner, Socrates, he appears to me to pay no less attention to <lb/>
            agricultural than to warlike pursuits." 13. ,; But in addition <lb/>
            to all this," continued Socrates, c'in whatever provinces he re­ <lb/>
            sides, and wheresoever he travels, he takes care that there <lb/>
            may be gardens, such as are called paradeisoi,1 stocked <lb/>
            with everything good and valuable that the soil will produce ; <lb/>
            and in these gardens he himself spends the greatest part of <lb/>
            his time, whenever the season of the year does not prevent <lb/>
            him." 14. " Assuredly, then, Socrates," observed Critobulus, <lb/>
            " the people must of necessity take care that, where the king <lb/>
            himself resides, the gardens be excellently stored with trees <lb/>
            and all other choice productions that the earth affords." <lb/>
            IS. "Some relate, too, Critobulus," added Socrates, "that <lb/>
            when the king distributes rewards, he calls forward first those <lb/>
            who have distinguished themselves in war, (because it would <lb/>
            be of no use to till a great quantity of ground, unless there <lb/>
            were soldiers to defend it,) and afterwards those who have <lb/>
            kept their lands in the best order, and rendered them most <lb/>
            productive, observing that even brave men would not be able <lb/>
            to live, unless there were tillers of the ground. 16. It is said <lb/>
            also that Cyrus, who was a most illustrious prince, remarked <lb/>
            on one occasion to those who were called to receive rewards, <lb/>
            that he himself might justly receive both sorts of presents; <lb/>
            for he excelled, he said, both in regulating his province, and <lb/>
            in defending it when it was regulated." 17. “ Cyrus, therefore, <lb/>
            Socrates," said Critobulus, “ if he made this observation, <lb/>
            prided himself not less on rendering his province fertile, and in <lb/>
            keeping it in order, than on his ability in war." is. " It <lb/>
            seems likely indeed," said Socrates, " that if Cyrus had lived, <lb/>
            he would have proved a very excellent king ; and of this pro­ <lb/>
            bability the following indication, as well as many others, has <lb/>

            merit in a general when men follow him willingly, and are <lb/>
            ready to stand by him in danger ; and around Cyrus, as long <lb/>

            killed with him when he died, contending over his body, ex­ <lb/>
            cept Ariæus, who happened to be posted in the left wing. <lb/>
            20. It is this Cyrus that is said to have paid Lysander, when <lb/>
            he came with presents to him from the allies, many marks of <lb/>
            civility (as Lysander himself once stated in conversation with <lb/>
            a friend of his at Megara), and to have shown him (as Lysan­ <lb/>
            der related) his park at Sardis. 21. When Lysander expressed <lb/>
            his admiration of it, observing how fine the trees were, how <lb/>
            regularly they were planted, how straight the rows of them <lb/>
            were, and how elegantly all the rows formed angles with one <lb/>
            another, while many sweet odours attended on Lysander and <lb/>
            Cyrus as they walked about;—admiring all this, lie said, 'I <lb/>
            look with astonishment on all these trees on account of their <lb/>
            beauty, but am still more astonished at the art of him who <lb/>
            measured out the ground, and arranged them all for you.' <lb/>
            22. Cyrus, on hearing this, was delighted, and said, 'It was I, let <lb/>
            me say, Lysander, that measured the ground and arranged all <lb/>
            the trees myself; and there are some of them,' he added, <lb/>
            ‘ that I planted with my own hand.' 23. Lysander, as he <lb/>
            told us, looked at Cyrus, and contemplating the beauty of the <lb/>
            robes which he had on, and perceiving the perfume that issued <lb/>
            from them, and the splendour of the necklaces, bracelets, and <lb/>
            other ornaments which he wore, said, ‘ What is it that you <lb/>
            tell me, Cyrus ? Did you, with your own hands, plant any of <lb/>
            these trees ?' 24. ‘ Do you wonder at this, Lysander ? ’ <lb/>
            replied Cyrus ; ‘ I swear to you by Mithras, that, whenever <lb/>
            I am in health, I never dine till I have put myself into a per­ <lb/>
            spiration by pursuing some military or agricultural occupation, <lb/>
            or by contending for superiority in some exercise of a similar <lb/>
            nature.'1 I, indeed, added Lysander, when I heard him say <lb/>
            this, took him by the hand, and said, ‘ You appear to me, <lb/>
            Cyrus, to be deservedly fortunate; for you have your good <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>Socrates continues to discourse of agriculture, and shows that the wealthiest <lb/>
            and noblest of men have given their attention to it, as it strengthens the <lb/>
            mind and body, improves the estate, and conduces to a virtuous course of <lb/>
            life. Critobulus makes some observations on the casualties to which <lb/>
            agricultural occupations are exposed; Socrates recommends, in reply, that <lb/>
            the gods should be carefully worshipped and propitiated.</p>
          <p>1. " THIS anecdote I relate to you, Critobulus," continued <lb/>
            Socrates, " to show that not even men of the most exalted <lb/>
            fortune are contented to abstain from agriculture; for the <lb/>
            pursuit of it seems to be at once a means of enjoyment and of <lb/>
            increasing their resources ; and it is also an exercise for the <lb/>
            body, such as to strengthen it for discharging the duties <lb/>
            that become a man of honourable birth, a. In the first place, <unclear/> <lb/>
            she earth yields the food on which men live to those who cul­ <lb/>
            tivate it, and produces in addition things from which they <lb/>
            receive gratification, 3. Besides these, it supplies the flowers <lb/>
            which decorate altars and statues, and with which men adorn <lb/>
            themselves, accompanied with the most pleasing odours and <lb/>
            appearances ; sauces and animal food,1 too, it partly produces <lb/>
            and partly nourishes, in great abundance (for the art of <lb/>
            managing cattle is connected with farming) ; so that men have <lb/>
            enough to propitiate the gods by sacrificing, and to use them­ <lb/>
            selves. 4. Yet, though it offers blessings in the greatest plenty, <lb/>
            it does not permit us to take them in idleness, but requires us <lb/>
            to accustom ourselves to endure the colds of winter and the <lb/>
            heats of summer; to those whom it exercises in manual labour, <lb/>
            it gives an increase of strength; and in such as only oversee <lb/>
            the cultivation of it,2 it produces a manly vigour, by requiring <lb/>
            them to rise early in the morning, and forcing them to move <lb/>
            about with activity ; for in the country, as well as in the city, <lb/>
            the most important matters are always done at a stated sea- <note type="footnote"> 1 ”<foreign xml:lang="grc">Οψα</foreign>.] Under this term was included whatever was eaten with bread, <lb/>

            son.1 5. Again, if a man wishes to serve his country2 as a <lb/>
            horse-soldier, farming offers the greatest convenience for <lb/>
            keeping a horse, or if as a foot-soldier, it keeps the body ro­ <lb/>
            bust ; and it also affords some incitement to exertion in hunt­ <lb/>
            ing over the land, supplying facilities for the keeping of dogs, <lb/>
            and supporting beasts of game. 6. The horses and dogs, more­ <lb/>
            over, which are kept by farming, benefit the farm in return ; <lb/>
            the horse, by carrying his master early in the morning to the <lb/>
            scene of his labours, and furnishing him the means of return­ <lb/>
            ing late; the dogs, by preventing the wild beasts from de­ <lb/>
            stroying the fruits of the earth and the cattle, and by affording <lb/>
            security even in the most solitary places.</p>
          <p>7. " The possession of land also stimulates agriculturists, in <lb/>
            some degree, to defend their country in arms, as the ground <lb/>
            produces its fruits exposed to all,4 for the strongest to take <lb/>
            possession of them. 8. What occupation, too, renders men <lb/>
            more fit for running, and throwing, and leaping, than agricul­ <lb/>
            ture ? What employment offers men greater gratification for <lb/>
            their labour ? What art welcomes the student of it with <lb/>
            greater pleasure, offering him that approaches, indeed, the <lb/>
            means of gaining whatever he desires ? What occupation re­ <lb/>
            ceives strangers with richer hospitality ? 9. Where is there <lb/>
            greater facility for passing the winter amid plenty of fires, <lb/>
            and warm baths, than on the farm ? Or where can we spend <lb/>
            the summer more agreeably, by streams, amid breezes, and <lb/>
            under shade, than in the fields ? 10. What other occupation <lb/>
            offers more pleasing first-fruits to the gods, or richer banquets <lb/>
            on festival days ? What pursuit is more comfortable for a <lb/>
            man's servants, more delightful to his wife, more attractive to <lb/>
            his children, or more gratifying to his friends ? n. I should <note type="footnote"> 1 '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Επικαιριώταται πράξεις</foreign>.] Weiske understands res maximè oppor­ <lb/>

            be surprised, for my own part, if any man of liberal feelings <lb/>
            has met with any possession more pleasing than a farm, or <lb/>
            discovered any pursuit more attractive, or more conducive to <lb/>
            the means of life, than agriculture.</p>
          <p>12. " The earth also kindly teaches men justice, at least <lb/>
            such as are able to learn ; for it is those who treat her best <lb/>
            that she recompenses with the most numerous benefits.</p>
          <p>13. " If on any occasion, moreover, those who are employed <lb/>
            in agriculture are forced to quit their occupations by a multi­ <lb/>
            tude of invading enemies, yet, as they have been bred to <lb/>
            vigorous and manly exertion, and are well exercised in mind <lb/>
            and body, they may, if the gods are not unfavourable, make <lb/>
            incursions into the lands of those who impede their occupations, <lb/>
            and carry off booty on which they may support themselves. <lb/>
            Frequently, indeed, in war, it is safer to seek a livelihood <lb/>
            with hostile weapons than with instruments of agriculture.</p>
          <p>14. " The cultivation of the ground, too, instructs men <lb/>
            to assist one another; for as we must make attacks on <lb/>
            enemies with the aid of men, so it is with aid of men that <lb/>
            agriculture must be conducted. 15. He, therefore, that would till <lb/>
            his ground properly must provide himself with labourers both <lb/>
            ready to work and willing to obey him ; and he that leads an <lb/>
            army against an enemy must take similar precautions, reward­ <lb/>
            ing those who act as good soldiers ought to act, and punishing <lb/>
            those who are neglectful of discipline. 16. A husbandman must <lb/>
            encourage his workmen as frequently as a general exhorts his <lb/>
            soldiers ; and slaves require favourable prospects to be held <lb/>
            out to them not less than free-men, and indeed even more, <lb/>
            that they may be willing to stay with their masters. 17. He also <lb/>
            said well, who pronounced agriculture to be the mother and <lb/>
            nurse of other arts ; for when agriculture flourishes, all other <lb/>
            pursuits are in full vigour ; but when the ground is forced to <lb/>
            lie barren, other occupations are almost stopped, as well by <lb/>
            land as by sea."</p>
          <p>18. When Critobulus had heard these remarks to an end, <lb/>
            he said, " You seem to me, my dear Socrates, to say all this <lb/>
            with great reason ; but you have not observed that there are <lb/>
            connected with agriculture many things which it is impossible <lb/>
            for man to foresee ; for sometimes hail, frost, drought, violent <lb/>
            rains, mildew, and often indeed other causes, deprive us of <lb/>
            the fruit of what has been excellently contrived and arranged ; <pb n="93"/>
             <note type="margin">§ 19, 20.] <lb/>
            and sometimes disease comes to carry off, in the most pitiable <lb/>
            manner, cattle that have been bred with the utmost care." <lb/>
            19. Socrates, listening to this, said, "I thought that you were <lb/>
            aware, Critobulus, that the gods are disposers of affairs in <lb/>
            agriculture not less than of those in war ; and you see, I sup­ <lb/>
            pose, that those who are engaged in the field of battle pro­ <lb/>
            pitiate the gods before they come to an engagement, and con­ <lb/>
            sult them, with the aid of sacrifices and auguries, to learn <lb/>
            what they ought or ought not to do. 20. And do you think <lb/>
            that there is less necessity to seek the favour of the gods with <lb/>
            regard to the proceedings of agriculture ? For be assured," <lb/>
            added he, " that wise men worship the gods with a view to <lb/>
            the preservation of their fruits, as well succulent as dry,1 and <lb/>
            of their oxen, horses, sheep, and all their other possessions." </note> </p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER VI.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Critobulus admits that the gods ought to be propitiated. Socrates recapitu­ <lb/>
            lates what he had said of the excellences of agriculture. Critobulus in­ <lb/>
            quires how it is that some persons are enriched, and others ruined, by agri­ <lb/>
            cultural occupations; Socrates replies, that the best way to satisfy him on <lb/>
            this point will be to introduce him to Ischomachus, an excellent husband­ <lb/>
            man, and a man of strict integrity and honour.</p>
          <p>1. " THIS also you appear to say with great reason, my dear <lb/>
            Socrates," said Critobulus, "desiring us to commence every <lb/>
            work with the gods in our favour, as the gods are the direct­ <lb/>
            ors of affairs of peace, no less than of those of war. In such <lb/>
            a way, accordingly, we will make it our care to act. But do <lb/>
            you, returning to the point at which you ceased to speak <lb/>
            of the management of a house, proceed to bring to a conclu­ <lb/>
            sion that which follows upon what you said ; as I seem to <lb/>
            myself, since I heard your observations on the subject, to see <lb/>
            somewhat better than before what I must do to increase <lb/>
            my means of living." 2. " What if we should first go back, <lb/>
            then," said Socrates, " to those particulars on which we agreed <lb/>
            as we went over them, that we may proceed also, if we find <lb/>
            it at all possible, to go through the remaining points so as to <lb/>
            agree upon them ? " 3. " Very well," said Critobulus ; " for <note type="footnote"> 1 Grapes and olives ; wheat and other grain. </note> <pb n="94"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[ CH. 6."/> <lb/>
            as it is gratifying to persons who have pecuniary accounts <lb/>
            between them to reach the conclusion of them without dis­ <lb/>
            agreement, so it will be pleasant for us, who are pursuing <lb/>
            a chain of reasoning between us, to go through the various <lb/>
            points on which we speak with unanimity."</p>
          <p>4. " The management of a house or estate, then," proceeded <lb/>
            Socrates, " was decided between us to be the name of an art <lb/>
            or science.. This art or science was defined to be that by <lb/>
            which men may increase, their houses or estates ; and a man's <lb/>
            house or estate was defined to be the same as his whole <lb/>
            possessions or goods. A man's goods we agreed to be what­ <lb/>
            ever is profitable for his well-being ; and profitable things <lb/>
            were defined to be all things that a person knows how to use. <lb/>
            5. We agreed that it was impossible to learn all arts, and <lb/>
            determined to exclude from our favour, in common with com­ <lb/>
            munities in general, those employments which are termed <lb/>
            handicrafts, as they appear to diminish bodily strength, and <lb/>
            cramp the powers of the mind. 6. We considered that the <lb/>
            plainest proof of this would be, if, when enemies invade a <lb/>
            country, we should divide the husbandmen and artisans into <lb/>
            two bodies, and ask each of them separately whether they <lb/>
            would be inclined to guard the open country, or to retreat <lb/>
            from the fields to defend the fortresses. 7. For under such <lb/>
            circumstances we thought that those who were employed <lb/>
            about the land would give their voice for defending it, while <lb/>
            the artisans would vote for not fighting, but for sitting still, <lb/>
            as they had been brought up without either working hard or <lb/>
            running into danger. 8. We were of opinion, too, that agri­ <lb/>
            culture, for an honourable and high-minded man, is the best of <lb/>
            all the occupations and arts by which men procure the means <lb/>
            of living. 9. For it is a pursuit that appeared to us most <lb/>
            easy to learn, and most pleasant to practise ; it seemed to us <lb/>
            to put the bodies of men in the fairest and most vigorous con <lb/>
            dition, and to be far from giving such constant occupation to <lb/>
            their minds as to prevent them from attending to the interests <lb/>
            of their friends or their country. 10. Agriculture also was <lb/>
            thought by us to afford some incitement to those who pursue <lb/>
            it to become courageous, as it produces and sustains what <lb/>
            is necessary for human. life without the walls of fortresses.. <note type="footnote"> I See note on c. 5, sect. 7 </note> <pb n="95"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="§ 11—16.]"/> <lb/>
            For these reasons, moreover, this mode of life appeared to us <lb/>
            to be the most honourable in the estimation of governments in <lb/>
            general, as well as because it seems to render the citizens most <lb/>
            virtuous and best affected towards the commonwealth."</p>
          <p>11. "That it is extremely honourable, and becoming, and <lb/>
            pleasant, indeed, Socrates," said Critobulus, " to derive the <lb/>
            means of life from agriculture, I think that I am quite sum­ <lb/>
            ciently convinced ; but as to what you said a while ago, that <lb/>
            you understood the reasons why some men manage their land <lb/>
            in such a way as to have abundance of whatever they need <lb/>
            from the culture of it, and why others labour on it in so differ­ <lb/>
            ent a manner that the cultivation of it is profitless to them, I <lb/>
            should like to hear from you the causes of both results, that I <lb/>
            may pursue what is beneficial, and avoid what is detrimental." <lb/>
            12. "What then if I should relate to you at length,1 Crito­ <lb/>
            bulus," said Socrates, " a conversation which I formerly held <lb/>
            with a man who appeared to me to be really one of those <lb/>
            to whom the epithets of fair and good2 are justly applied ? " <lb/>
            " I should be extremely pleased," said Critobulus, " to hear <lb/>
            that conversation, as I myself desire also to become deserving <lb/>
            of those epithets." 13. " I will tell you, then," said Socrates, <lb/>
            " how I came to visit the man ; 3 for a very short time was <lb/>
            amply sufficient for me to go round among good carpenters, <lb/>
            good workers in brass, good painters and statuaries, and other <lb/>
            persons of that kind, and to view such works of theirs as were <lb/>
            esteemed beautiful. 14. But in order to learn the characters <lb/>
            of those who love the honourable distinction of being fair and <lb/>
            good, and to ascertain by what course of conduct they de­ <lb/>
            served to be called so, I felt an extraordinary desire to con­ <lb/>
            verse with one of them. 15. And, in the first place, as the <lb/>
            epithet fair was added to that of good, I accosted whomsoever <lb/>
            I observed to be of a handsome person, and endeavoured to <lb/>
            satisfy myself whether I could anywhere find goodness added <lb/>
            to beauty. 16. But such was not always the case ; for I felt <lb/>
            myself convinced that some of those who were beautiful in <lb/>
            form were altogether depraved in mind. I determined there- <note type="footnote">1 '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Εξαρχη̃ς</foreign>, from the beginning. </note><note type="footnote">2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Καλός τε κἀγαθός</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Εἰς τὴν σκέψιν αὐτου̃</foreign>.] Ad invisendum hominem illum.

            good by everybody, both men and women, foreigners and' <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>Socrates relates how he first met with Ischomachus; how he asked him why <lb/>
            he was called the fair and good; and how he learned from him the nature <lb/>
            of his occupations and mode of life, and the character of his wife. Dialogue <lb/>
            of Ischomachus with his wife, in which all the domestic duties of husband <lb/>
            and wife are specified. Honours attendant on a wife who discharges her <lb/>
            duties with efficiency and conscientiousness.</p>

            of the temple of Jupiter Eleutherius, I went towards him, and <lb/>
            as he seemed to me to be at leisure, sat down near him, <lb/>
            and said, ' Why are you, Ischomachus, who are not accustomed <lb/>
            to be idle, sitting thus ? for in general I see you either doing <lb/>
            something, or certainly not altogether wasting your time, in <lb/>
            the market-place.' 2. ' Nor would you now see me quite un­ <lb/>
            occupied, Socrates,' said Ischomachus, ' if I had not made an <lb/>
            appointment to wait here for some strangers.' ' But when <lb/>
            you have no such engagements,' said I, ' where, in the name <lb/>
            of heaven, do you spend your time, and how do you employ <lb/>
            yourself ? for I have the strongest desire to learn from you <lb/>
            what it is you do that you are called fair and good ; since you <lb/>
            certainly do not pass your life indoors, nor does your com­ <lb/>
            plexion look like that of a man who does so.' 3. Ischomachus, <lb/>
            smiling at my inquiry, what do you do to be called fair and <lb/>
            good, and being pleased at it, as it seemed to me, replied, <lb/>
            ' Whether people, when they talk together about me, give me <lb/>
            that appellation, I do not know ; but certainly when they call <lb/>
            upon me as to the antidosis of the duties of a trierarch or <note type="footnote"> 1 There was a law at Athens that if any person were called on to take <lb/>

            choragus, no one summons me by the name of fair and good, <lb/>
            but they designate me plainly as Ischomachus, distinguishing <lb/>
            me by the name of my father ; and as to what you asked me <lb/>
            besides, Socrates, I assuredly do not spend my life indoors ; <lb/>
            for,' added he, 'my wife is quite capable herself of managing <lb/>
            what is to be done in my housed 4. ' But,' said I, ' Ischoma­ <lb/>
            chus, ' I would very gladly be permitted to ask you whether <lb/>
            you instructed your wife yourself, so that she might be quali­ <lb/>
            fied as she ought to be, or whether, when you received her <lb/>
            from her father and mother, she was possessed of sufficient <lb/>
            knowledge to manage what belongs to her.' 5. ' And how, <lb/>
            my dear Socrates,' said he, 'could she have had sufficient <lb/>
            knowledge when I took her, since she came to my house when <lb/>
            she was not fifteen years old,1 and had spent the preceding <lb/>
            part of her life under the strictest restraint, in order that she <lb/>
            might see as little, hear as little, and ask as few questions as <lb/>
            possible ?2 6. Does it not appear to you to be quite sufficient, <lb/>
            if she did but know, when she came, how to take wool and <lb/>
            make a garment, and had seen how to apportion the tasks of <lb/>
            spinning among the maid-servants ? for as to what concerns <lb/>
            the appetite,3 Socrates,' added he, ' which seems to me a most <lb/>
            important part of instruction both for a man and for a woman, <lb/>
            she came to me extremely well instructed.' 7. ' But as to <lb/>
            other things, Ischomachus,' said I, ' did you yourself instruct <lb/>
            your wife, so that she should be qualified to attend to the <lb/>
            affairs belonging to her ?' ' Not, indeed,' replied Ischomachus, <lb/>
            ' until I had offered sacrifice, and prayed that it might be my <lb/>
            fortune to teach, and hers to learn, what would be best for <lb/>
            both of us.' 8. 'Did your wife, then,' said I, 'join with you <lb/>
            in offering sacrifice, and in praying for these blessings ?' <lb/>
            ' Certainly,' answered Ischomachus, ' and she made many <note type="footnote"> of him, he might summon that citizen either to take the office or tc <lb/>

            be, and showed plainly that she was not likely to disregard <lb/>
            what was taught her.' 9. ' In the name of the gods, Ischo­ <lb/>
            machus, tell me,' said I, ' what you began to teach her first ; <lb/>
            for I shall have more pleasure in hearing you give this <lb/>
            account, than if you were to give me a description of the <lb/>
            finest gymnastic or equestrian games.' 10. ' Well, then, So­ <lb/>
            crates,' returned Ischomachus, 'when she grew familiarized <lb/>
            and domesticated with me, so that we conversed freely to­ <lb/>
            gether, I began to question her in some such way as this : <lb/>
            " Tell me, my dear wife, have you ever considered with what <lb/>
            view I married you, and with what object your parents gave <lb/>
            you to me ? II. For that there was no want of other persons <lb/>
            with whom we might have shared our respective beds1 must, <lb/>
            I am sure, be evident to you as well as to me. But when I <lb/>
            considered for myself, and your parents for you, whom we <lb/>
            might select as the best partner for a house and children, <lb/>
            I preferred you, and your parents, as it appears, preferred me, <lb/>
            out of those who were possible objects of choice. 12. If, then, <lb/>
            the gods should ever grant children to be born to us, we shall <lb/>
            then consult together, with regard to them, how we may <lb/>
            bring them up as well as possible ; for it will be a common <lb/>
            advantage to both of us to find them of the utmost service as <lb/>
            supporters and maintainers of our old age. 13. At present, <lb/>
            however, this is our common household ; for I deposit all that <lb/>
            I have as in common between us, and you put everything <lb/>
            that you have brought into our common stock. Nor is it ne­ <lb/>
            cessary to consider which of the two has contributed the <lb/>
            greater share ; but we ought to feel assured that whichsoever <lb/>
            of us is the better manager of our common fortune will give <lb/>
            the more valuable service." 14. To these remarks, Socrates, <lb/>
            my wife replied, " In what respect could I cooperate with <lb/>
            you ? What power have I ? Everything lies with you. My <lb/>
            duty, my mother told me, was to conduct myself discreetly." <lb/>
            15. " Yes, by Jupiter, my dear wife," replied I, "and my father <lb/>
            told me the same. But it is the part of discreet people, as. <lb/>
            well husbands as wives, to act in such a manner that their <note type="footnote"> 1 '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Εκαθεύδομεν ἄν</foreign>.] We must consider the verb, says Breitenbach, to <lb/>

            large additions as possible may be made to it by honourable <lb/>
            and just means." 16. " And, what do you see," said my wife, <lb/>
            " that I can do to assist in increasing our property ? " " En­ <lb/>
            deavour by all means," answered I, " to do in the best possible <lb/>
            manner those duties which the gods have qualified you to do, <lb/>
            and which custom1 approves." 17. And what are they ?" <lb/>
            asked she. " I consider," replied I, " that they are duties of no <lb/>
            small importance, unless indeed the queen bee in a hive is ap­ <lb/>
            pointed for purposes of small importance. is. For to me,"' <lb/>
            continued he,'" the gods, my dear wife," said I, " seem certainly <lb/>
            to have united that pair of beings, which is called male and <lb/>
            female, with the greatest judgment, that they may be in the <lb/>
            highest degree serviceable to each other in their connexion. <lb/>
            19. In the first place, the pair are brought together to produce <lb/>
            offspring, that the races of animals may not become extinct; <lb/>
            and to human beings, at least, it is granted to have supporters <lb/>
            for their old age from this union. 20. For human beings, also, <lb/>
            their mode of life is not, like that of cattle, in the open air ; <lb/>
            but they have need, we see, of houses. It is accordingly ne­ <lb/>
            cessary for those who would have something to bring into <lb/>
            their houses to have people to perform the requisite employ­ <lb/>
            ments in the open air ; for tilling, and sowing, and planting, <lb/>
            and pasturage are all employments for the open air ; and <lb/>
            from these employments the necessaries of life are procured. 21 <lb/>
            But when these necessaries have been brought into the house, <lb/>
            there is need of some one to take care of them, and to do <lb/>
            whatever duties require to be done under shelter. The rear­ <lb/>
            ing of young children also demands shelter, as well as the <lb/>
            preparation of food from the fruits of the earth, and the mak­ <lb/>
            ing of clothes from wool. 22. And as both these sorts of <lb/>
            employments, alike those without doors and those within, re­ <lb/>
            quire labour and care, the gods, as it seems to me," said I, <lb/>
            "have plainly adapted the nature of the woman for works <lb/>
            and duties within doors, and that of the man for works and <lb/>
            duties without doors. 23. For the divinity has fitted the body <lb/>
            and mind of the man to be better able to bear cold, and heat, <lb/>
            and travelling, and military exercises, so that he has imposed <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">Νόμος</foreign>.] Lex. Dindorf. But Sturz, in his Lexicon, vol. iii. p. 209 <lb/>
            gives it the sense of mos, consuetudo, which seems to be more suitable to <lb/>
            the passage. See sect. 30. </note> <note type="footnote"> H 2 </note> <pb n="100"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[CH. 7."/> <lb/>
            upon him the work without doors ; and by having formed the <lb/>
            body of the woman to be less able to bear such exertions, he <lb/>
            appears to me to have laid upon her," said I, " the duties within <lb/>
            doors. 24. But knowing that he had given the woman by <lb/>
            nature, and laid upon her, the office of rearing young children, <lb/>
            he has also bestowed upon her a greater portion of love for <lb/>
            her newly-born offspring than on the man. 25. Since, too, the <lb/>
            divinity has laid upon the woman the duty of guarding what is <lb/>
            brought into the house, he, knowing that the mind, by being <lb/>
            timid, is not less adapted for guarding, has given a larger <lb/>
            share of timidity to the woman than to the man ; and know­ <lb/>
            ing also that if any one injures him who is engaged in the oc­ <lb/>
            cupations without, he must defend himself, he has on that ac­ <lb/>
            count given a greater portion of boldness to the man.1 26. But <lb/>
            as it is necessary for both alike to give and to receive, he has <lb/>
            bestowed memory and the power of attention upon both impar­ <lb/>
            tially, so that you cannot distinguish whether the female or <lb/>
            the male has the larger portion of them. 27. The power of <lb/>
            being temperate also in what is necessary he has conferred <lb/>
            in equal measure upon both, and has allowed that whichsoever <lb/>
            of the two is superior in this virtue, whether the man or the <lb/>
            woman, shall receive a greater portion of the benefit arising <lb/>
            from it. 28. But as the nature of both is not fully adapted <lb/>
            for all these requirements, they in consequence stand in <lb/>
            greater need of aid from one another, and the pair are of <lb/>
            greater service to each other, when the one is able to do those <lb/>
            things in which the other is deficient. 29. As we know, then, <lb/>
            my dear wife," continued I, " what is appointed to each of us <lb/>
            by Providence, it is incumbent on us to discharge as well <lb/>
            as we can that which each of us has to do.</p>
          <p>30. '" The law,3 too," I told her,'he proceeded, '"gives its ap­ <lb/>
            probation to these arrangements, by uniting the man and the <lb/>
            woman; and as the divinity has made them partners, as it <lb/>
            were, in their offspring, so the law ordains them to be sharers <lb/>

            each to do with greater facility; for it is more becoming for <lb/>
            the woman to stay within doors than to roam abroad, but to <lb/>
            the man it is less creditable to remain at home than to attend <lb/>
            to things out of doors. 31. And if any one acts contrary to <lb/>
            what the divinity has fitted him to do, he will, while he <lb/>
            violates the order of things, possibly not escape the notice of <lb/>
            the gods, and will pay the penalty whether of neglecting his own <lb/>
            duties or of interfering with those of his wife. 32. The <lb/>
            queen of the bees," I added, " appears to me to discharge such <lb/>
            duties as are appointed her by the divinity." " And what <lb/>
            duties," inquired my wife, "has the queen bee to perform, <lb/>
            that she should be made an example for the business which I <lb/>
            have to do ? " 33. " She, remaining within the hive," answered <lb/>
            I, " does not allow the bees to be idle, but sends out to their <lb/>
            duty those who ought to work abroad; and whatever each of <lb/>
            them brings in. she takes cognizance of it and receives it, and <lb/>
            watches over the store until there is occasion to use it; and <lb/>
            when the time for using it is come, she dispenses to each bee its <lb/>
            just due. 34. She also presides over the construction of the <lb/>
            cells within, that they may be formed beautifully and expe­ <lb/>
            ditiously. She attends, too, to the rising progeny, that they <lb/>
            may be properly reared; and when the young bees are grown <lb/>
            up, and are fit for work, she sends out a colony of them under <lb/>
            some leader taken from among the younger bees."' 35. " Will <lb/>
            it then be necessary for me," said my wife, " to do such <lb/>
            things ?" " It will certainly be necessary for yon," said I, <lb/>
            " to remain at home, and to send out such of the labourers as <lb/>
            have to work abroad, to their duties; and over such as have <lb/>
            business to do in the house you must exercise a watchful <lb/>
            superintendence. 36. Whatever is brought into the house, <lb/>
            you must take charge of it; whatever portion of it is required <lb/>
            for use you must give out; and whatever should be laid by, <lb/>
            you must take account of it and keep it safe, so that the pro­ <lb/>
            vision stored up for a year, for example, may not be expended <lb/>
            in a month. Whenever wool is brought home to you, you <lb/>
            must take care that garments be made for those who want <lb/>
            them. You must also be careful that the dried provisions <note type="footnote"> ' <foreign xml:lang="grc">Σὺν τω̃ν ἐπιγόνων τινὶ ἡγεμόνι</foreign>.] Breitenbach reads, with some erf <lb/>

            duties, however," I added, "will perhaps appear somewhat <lb/>
            disagreeable, namely, that whoever of all the servants may <lb/>
            fall sick, you must take charge of him, that he may be re­ <lb/>
            covered." 38. " Nay, assuredly," returned my wife, " that will <lb/>
            be a most agreeable office,1 if such as receive good treatment <lb/>
            are likely to make a grateful return, and to become more attached <lb/>
            to me than before." Delighted with her answer,' continued <lb/>
            Ischomachus, ' I said to her, " Are not the bees, my dear wife, <lb/>
            in consequence of some such care on the part of the queen <lb/>
            of the hive, so affected toward her, that, when she quits the <lb/>
            hive, no one of them thinks of deserting her, but all follow in <lb/>
            her train ?" 39. "I should wonder, however," answered my <lb/>
            wife, , if the duties of leader do not rather belong to you than <lb/>
            to me; for my guardianship of what is in the house, and <lb/>
            distribution of it, would appear rather ridiculous, I think, if <lb/>
            you did not take care that something might be brought in <lb/>
            from out of doors." 40. And on the other hand," returned I, <lb/>
            " my bringing in would appear ridiculous, unless there were <lb/>
            somebody to take care of what is brought in. Do you not <lb/>
            see," said I, " how those who are said to draw water in a <lb/>
            bucket full of holes are pitied, as they evidently labour in <lb/>
            vain ?" 2 " Certainly," replied my wife, " for they are indeed <lb/>
            wretched, if they are thus employed."</p>
          <p>41. " Some other of your occupations, my dear wife," con­ <lb/>
            tinued I, " will be pleasing to you. For instance, when you <lb/>
            take a young woman who does not know how to spin, and <lb/>
            make her skilful at it, and she thus becomes of twice as much <lb/>
            value to you. Or when you take one who is ignorant of the <lb/>
            duties of a housekeeper or servant, and, having made her <lb/>
            accomplished, trustworthy, and handy, render her of the high­ <lb/>
            est value. Or when it is in your power to do services to such <lb/>
            of your attendants as are steady and useful, while, if any one is <lb/>
            found transgressing, you can inflict punishment. 42. But you <lb/>
            will experience the greatest of pleasures, if you show yourself <lb/>
            superior to me, and render me your servant, and have no cause <lb/>
            to fear that, as life advances, you may become less respected <note type="footnote"> 1 '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Επιχαριτώτατον μὲν οὖν</foreign>.] Miv ovv, in reply to a question to which <lb/>

            and honourable," I added, " gains increase of respect, not from <lb/>
            beauty of person, but from merits directed to the benefit of <lb/>
            human life." Such were the subjects, Socrates, on which, <lb/>

            wife was at all the more incited to carefulness by your re­ <lb/>
            marks ?' ' Indeed I did,' replied Ischomachus, ' and I saw <lb/>
            her on one occasion greatly concerned and put to the blush, <lb/>
            because, when I asked for something that had been brought <lb/>
            into the house, she was unable to give it me. 2. Perceiving <lb/>
            that she was in great trouble, however, I said, " Do not be <lb/>
            cast down, my dear wife, because you cannot give me what <lb/>
            I am asking you for. It is indeed pure poverty not to have <lb/>
            a thing to use when you need it ; 1 but our present want­ <lb/>
            not to be able to find a thing when you seek it-is of a less <lb/>
            serious nature than not to seek it at all, knowing that it is not <lb/>
            in your possession. However," added I, "you are not in fault <lb/>
            on the present occasion, but I, as I did not direct you, when I <lb/>
            gave you the articles, where each of them ought to be deposit­ <lb/>
            ed,. so that you might know how you ought to arrange them <lb/>
            and whence to take them. 3. There is indeed nothing, my dear <lb/>
            wife, more useful or more creditable to people than order. <note type="footnote"> I It is an old proverb, that it is evident poverty not to be able, when <lb/>
            you want a thing, to use it, because you do not know where it has been <lb/>

            A chorus of singers and dancers, for instance, consists of a <lb/>
            number of persons; but when they do whatever each of them <lb/>
            happens to fancy, all appears confusion, and disagreeable to be­ <lb/>
            hold; but when they act and speak in concert, the same persons <lb/>
            prove themselves worthy of being seen and heard. 4. An <lb/>
            army, too, my dear wife," I continued, "is, when undisciplined, <lb/>
            a mass of confusion, easy to be overcome by the enemy, un­ <lb/>
            pleasing to the eyes of its friends, and of no possible use, <lb/>
            asses, heavy-armed troops, baggage-carriers, light-armed <lb/>
            men, horse-soldiers, carriages, being mingled together; for <lb/>
            how could the men march, when, being in such a condition, <lb/>
            they obstruct one another, he that is marching slow impeding <lb/>
            him that is marching quick, he that is marching quick running <lb/>
            against him that is halting, while the carriage is in the way of <lb/>
            the trooper, the ass in that of the carriage, and the bag­ <lb/>
            gage-bearer in that of the foot-soldier ? 5. Or if they had to <lb/>
            fight, how could they do so in such confusion ? for such of <lb/>
            them as might have to retreat before the enemy's charge, <lb/>
            might possibly, in their retreat, trample down others standing <lb/>
            under arms. 6. But an army in good order is a most pleas­ <lb/>
            ing sight to its friends, and a most formidable object to the <lb/>
            enemy. For what friend would not contemplate with pleasure <lb/>
            a body of infantry marching in order ? Or who would not <lb/>
            admire cavalry riding with perfect regularity? Or what <lb/>
            enemy would not be moved with fear, when he sees heavy- <lb/>
            armed infantry, cavalry, targeteers, archers, and slingers dis­ <lb/>
            tinctly arranged, and following their officers in good order ? <lb/>
            7. Even though there be many myriads, yet, as long as they pro­ <lb/>
            ceed in order, they all mc7e at ease like one man; for those who <lb/>
            come up from the rear fill up constantly whatever space is <lb/>
            left vacant. 8. From what other cause is a galley, too, which is <lb/>
            crowded with men, formidable to an enemy, or a pleasant <lb/>
            sight to its friends, than on account of its speedy passage over <lb/>
            the water? But for what other reason are those who sail in <lb/>
            it no obstruction to one another, than because they sit in <lb/>
            order, lean forward over their oars and draw back in order, <lb/>
            and preserve order in embarking and disembarking ? o. But <lb/>
            as to disorder, it seems to me something like as if a husband­ <lb/>
            man should throw into his granary1 barley and wheat and <lb/>
            peas together, and then, when he wants barley bread, or wheat. <note type="footnote"> - '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Εμβάλοι</foreign>.]In horreum condide it. Breitenbach. </note> <pb n="105"/>

            en bread, or peas soup, should have to abstract them grain <lb/>
            by grain, instead of having them separately laid up for his <lb/>
            use. 10. If you, therefore, my dear wife, do not wish to <lb/>
            be involved in such confusion, but desire to understand how <lb/>
            to arrange our property, to take with ease any portion of what <lb/>
            you have, and to use it for the purpose for which you require <lb/>
            it, and also to oblige me by handing me whatever I may ask <lb/>
            of you, let us select a place for. everything separately, suitable <lb/>
            for keeping it, and having deposited it there, let us give notice <lb/>
            to the housekeeper whence to take it, and to put it there again; <lb/>
            and thus we shall know what is in reserve, and what has been <lb/>
            used; for the place itself will indicate the absence of what is <lb/>
            gone ; while a glance will show what needs attention, and the <lb/>
            knowledge where any particular thing is, will at once put it <lb/>
            into our hands, so that we may be at no loss when we have <lb/>
            to use it."</p>
          <p>11. " 'I once saw, I think, the most beautiful and accurate <lb/>
            arrangement of implements possible, Socrates, when I went <lb/>
            on board that large Phœnician vessel1 to look over it; for I <lb/>
            beheld a vast number of articles severally arranged in an ex­ <lb/>
            tremely small space. 12. For the ship,' continued he, 'is <lb/>
            orought into harbour and taken out again by means of vari­ <lb/>
            ous instruments of wood and tow; it pursues its voyage with <lb/>
            the aid of much that is called suspended tackle; it is equipped <lb/>
            with many machines to oppose hostile vessels ; it carries about <lb/>
            in it many weapons for the men ; it conveys all the utensils, <lb/>
            such as people use in a house, for each company that take <lb/>
            their meals together; and, in addition to all this, it is freighted <lb/>
            with merchandise, which the owner of the ship transports in <lb/>
            it for the purpose of profit. 13. And all the things of which <lb/>
            I am speaking,' continued he, ' were stowed in a space not <lb/>
            much larger than is contained in a room that holds half a <lb/>
            score dinner-couches.2 Yet I observed that they were sever­ <lb/>
            ally arranged in such a manner that they were not in the way <lb/>
            of one another, nor required anybody to seek for them, nor <lb/>
            were unprepared for use, nor difficult to remove from their <note type="footnote"> 1 He speaks of some well-known large Phœnician vessel, which, per­ <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[CH. 8,"/> <lb/>
            places, so as to cause any delay when it was necessary to employ <lb/>
            them suddenly. 14. The pilot's officer, too, who is called the <lb/>
            man of the prow, I found so well acquainted with the location <lb/>
            of them all. that he could tell, even when out of sight of them, <lb/>
            where each severally lay, and how many there were, not less <lb/>
            readily than a man who knows his letters can tell how many <lb/>
            there are in the name Socrates, and where each of them stands. <lb/>
            15. I saw,' pursued Ischomachus, ' this very man inspecting, <lb/>
            at his leisure, all the implements that it is necessary to use in <lb/>
            a ship, and, wondering at his minute examination, I asked <lb/>
            him what he was doing. " I am examining, stranger," said <lb/>
            he, " in case anything should happen, in what state everything <lb/>
            in the vessel is, and whether anything is wanting, or is placed <lb/>
            so as to be inconvenient for use. 16. For," said he, " there is <lb/>
            no time, when heaven sends a storm over the sea, either to <lb/>
            seek for what may be wanting, or to hand out what may be <lb/>
            difficult to use ; for the gods threaten and punish the negli­ <lb/>
            gent ; and if they but forbear from destroying those who do <lb/>
            nothing wrong, we must be very well content; while, if they <lb/>
            preserve even those that attend to everything quite properly, <lb/>
            much gratitude is due to them." 17. I, therefore, having <lb/>
            observed the accuracy of this arrangement, said to my wife, <lb/>
            that it would be extremely stupid in us, if people in ships, <lb/>
            which are comparatively small places, find room for their <lb/>
            things, and, though they are violently tossed about, neverthe­ <lb/>
            less keep them in order, and, even in the greatest alarm, still <lb/>
            find out how to get what they want; and if we, who have <lb/>
            large separate repositories in our house for everything, and <lb/>
            our house firmly planted on the ground, should not discover <lb/>
            excellent and easily-found places for our several articles ;­ <lb/>
            how could this, I say, be anything but extreme stupidity <lb/>
            in us ?</p>
          <p>18. "' How excellent a thing a regular arrangement of arti­ <lb/>
            cles is, and how easy it is to find, in a house, a place such as <lb/>
            is suitable to put everything, I have sufficiently shown. <lb/>
            19. But how beautiful an appearance it has, too, when shoes, <lb/>
            for instance, of whatever kind they are, are arranged in <lb/>
            order; how beautiful it is to see garments, of whatever kind, <lb/>
            deposited in their several places; how beautiful it is to see <lb/>
            bed-clothes, and brazen vessels, and table furniture, so ar­ <lb/>
            ranged ; and (what, most of all, a person might laugh at, not <pb n="107"/>

            indeed a grave person, but a jester), I say,' that pots have <lb/>
            a graceful appearance when they are placed in regular order. <lb/>
            20. Other articles somehow appear, too, when regularly ar­ <lb/>
            ranged, more beautiful in consequence;2 for the several sorts <lb/>
            of vessels seem like so many choral bands; and the space <lb/>
            that is between them pleases the eye, when every sort of ves­ <lb/>
            sel is set clear of it; just as a body of singers and dancers, <lb/>
            moving in a circle,3 is not only in itself a beautiful sight, but <lb/>
            the space in the middle of it, being open and clear, is agree­ <lb/>
            able to the eye. 21. Whether what I say is true, my dear wife," <lb/>
            said I, " we may make trial, without suffering any loss, or <lb/>
            taking any extraordinary trouble. Nor ought we at all to <lb/>
            labour under the apprehension that it will be difficult to find <lb/>
            a person who will learn the places for every article, and re­ <lb/>
            member how to keep each of them separate ; 22- for we know <lb/>
            very well that the whole city contains ten thousand times as <lb/>
            much as our house, and yet, whichsoever of the servants you <lb/>
            order to buy anything and bring it to you from the market- <lb/>
            place, not one of them will be in perplexity, but every one <lb/>
            will show that he knows whither he must go to fetch any <lb/>
            article. For this," added I, " there is no other reason than <lb/>
            that each article is deposited in its appointed place. 23. But <lb/>
            if you should seek for a person, and sometimes even for one <lb/>
            who is on his part seeking you, you would often give up the <lb/>
            search in despair before you find him; and for this there is <lb/>
            no other cause, than that it is not appointed where the par­ <lb/>
            ticular person is to await you." Such was the conversation <lb/>
            that I had with my wife, as far as I remember, concerning <lb/>
            the arrangement and distinction4 of articles.' <note type="footnote">1 Dindorf and Breitenbach very properly read <foreign xml:lang="grc">φημὶ</foreign> here; the old <lb/>

          <p>Ischomachus points out the use and object of the various apartments in his <lb/>
            house. He and his wife make choice of a housekeeper. Attention of <lb/>
            servants to their work must be secured by the careful superintendence of <lb/>
            the mistress.</p>
          <p>1. " 'AND what was the result,' said I, ' my dear Ischo­ <lb/>
            machus ? Did your wife appear to attend to any of the mat­ <lb/>
            ters which you took so much pains to impress upon her?' <lb/>
            ' What else did she do but promise that she would attend to <lb/>
            what I said, and manifest the greatest pleasure, as if she had <lb/>
            found relief from perplexity ? and she requested me to ar­ <lb/>
            range the various articles, as soon as I could, in the manner <lb/>
            which I had proposed.' 2. ' And how, Ischomachus,' said <lb/>
            I, ' did you arrange them for her?' ' What else could I do <lb/>
            but determine upon showing her, in the first place, the capa­ <lb/>
            city of the house ? For it is not adorned with decorations, <lb/>
            but the apartments in it are constructed with such a view <lb/>
            that they may be as convenient receptacles as possible for the <lb/>
            things that are to be placed in them; so that they themselves <lb/>
            invite whatever is adapted for them respectively.1 3. Thus <lb/>
            the inner chamber, being in a secure part of the house, calls <lb/>
            for the most valuable couch-coverings and vessels; the dry <lb/>
            parts of the building for the corn; the cool places for the <lb/>
            wine ; and the well-lighted portions for such articles of work­ <lb/>
            manship, and vases, as require a clear light. 4. I pointed out <lb/>
            to her, too, that the apartments for people to live in,2 which <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τὰ πρέποντ</foreign>a <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔνι ἑκάστῳ</foreign>.] This is Dindorf's reading, from conjec­ <lb/>

            the sun in winter ; and I made her notice as to the whole <lb/>
            house how it lies open to the south, so that it is plain it has <lb/>
            plenty of sun in winter, and plenty of shade in summer.1 5. I <lb/>
            pointed out to her also the situation of the apartment for the <lb/>
            females, separated from that of the men by a door fastened <lb/>
            with a bolt,2 that nothing improper may be taken out, and <lb/>
            that the servants may not have children without our know­ <lb/>
            ledge ; for good slaves, when they have children, generally <lb/>
            become still better disposed; but bad ones, when they form <lb/>
            connexions, increase their power to do mischief. 6. When <lb/>
            we had gone through these places,' he continued, ' we then <lb/>
            proceeded to classify our goods. We began by collecting, <lb/>
            first of all, whatever we use for offering sacrifices ; after this, <lb/>
            we arranged the dresses for women, such as are suited for <lb/>
            festival days; and then the equipments for men, as well for <lb/>
            festivities as for warfare; and next the bed-coverings in the <lb/>
            women's apartments, the bed-coverings in the men's apart­ <lb/>
            ments, the shoes for the women and the shoes for the men. <lb/>
            7. Of utensils there were distinct collections, one of instruments <lb/>
            for spinning, another of those for preparing corn, another of <lb/>
            those for cooking, another of those for the bath, another of <lb/>
            those for kneading bread, another of those for the table. <lb/>
            These in general we divided into two sorts, such as we have <lb/>
            to use constantly, and such as are required only at festal en­ <lb/>
            tertainments. 8. We also made one assortment of what would <lb/>
            be used in a month, and another of what was computed to <lb/>
            last for a year; for in this way it is less likely to escape our <lb/>
            knowledge how particular things are expended. When we <lb/>
            had thus distinguished all our goods into classes, we conveyed <lb/>
            them severally to the places best suited for them. 9. Afterwards, <lb/>
            whatever utensils the servants require daily, such as those for <lb/>
            preparing corn, for cooking, for spinning, and any o'hers of <lb/>
            that sort, we pointed out to those who use them the places <lb/>
            where they were to put them, and then committed them to <note type="footnote">1 Apparently from the effect of the portico. See note on Mem. Soc. <lb/>

            their keeping, charging them to keep them safely; 10. but <lb/>
            such as we use only for festival days, for entertaining guests, <lb/>
            or only occasionally at long intervals, we committed, after <lb/>
            pointing out the places for them, and numbering and making <lb/>
            lists of them, to the housekeeper, and told her to give out any <lb/>
            of them to whatever servant needed them, to bear in mind to <lb/>
            which of them she gave any one, and, after receiving them <lb/>
            back, to deposit them respectively in the places from which <lb/>
            she took them.</p>
          <p>11. “‘ Of the housekeeper we made choice after considering <lb/>
            which of the female servants appeared to have most self­ <lb/>
            restraint in eating, and wine, and sleep, and converse with <lb/>
            the male sex; and, in addition to this, which seemed to have <lb/>
            the best memory, and which appeared to have forethought, <lb/>
            that she might not incur punishment from us for neglect, and <lb/>
            to consider how, by gratifying us, she might gain some mark <lb/>
            of approbation in return. 12. We formed her to entertain <lb/>
            feelings of affection towards us, giving her a share in our <lb/>
            pleasure when we had an occasion of rejoicing, and consulting <lb/>
            her, if anything troublesome occurred, with reference to it. <lb/>
            We also led her to become desirous of increasing our pro­ <lb/>
            perty, by stimulating her to take accounts of it, and making <lb/>
            her in some degree partaker of our prosperity. 13. We also <lb/>
            excited in her a love of honesty, by paying more respect to <lb/>
            the well-principled than to the unprincipled, and showing her <lb/>
            that they lived in greater plenty and in better style. We <lb/>
            then installed her in her appointment.1 14. But in addition <lb/>
            to all this, Socrates,' said he, ‘I told my wife that there <lb/>
            would be no profit in all these arrangements, unless she her­ <lb/>
            self took care that the appointed order for everything should <lb/>
            he preserved. I also instructed her that in the best-regulated <lb/>
            political communities it is not thought sufficient by the citi­ <lb/>
            zens merely to make good laws, but that they also appoint <lb/>
            guardians of the laws, who, overlooking the state, commend <lb/>
            him who acts in conformity with the laws, and, if any one <lb/>
            transgresses the laws, punish him. 15. I accordingly desired <lb/>
            my wife,' continued he, ‘ to consider herself the guardian of <lb/>
            the laws established in the house, and to inspect the household <note type="footnote"> I The common texts have <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν αὐτη̜̃τη̜̃χώρα̜</foreign> : Breitenbach's, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν ταύτι <lb/>

            a garrison inspects his sentinels; to signify her approbation <lb/>
            if everything was in good condition, as the senate1 signifies <lb/>
            its approval of the horses and horse-soldiers; to praise and <lb/>
            honour the deserving like a queen, according to her means, <lb/>
            and to rebuke and disgrace any one that required such treat­ <lb/>
            ment. 16. But I moreover admonished her,' added he, ‘ that <lb/>
            she would have no reason to be displeased, if I imposed on <lb/>
            her more trouble with regard to our property than I laid on <lb/>
            the servants; remarking to her, that servants have only so <lb/>
            far a concern with their master's property as to carry it, or <lb/>
            keep it in order, or take care of it; but that no servant has <lb/>
            any power of using it unless his master puts it into his hands, <lb/>
            while it belongs all to the master himself, so that he may use <lb/>
            any portion of it for whatever purpose he pleases. 17. To <lb/>
            him therefore that receives the greatest benefit from its pre­ <lb/>
            servation, and suffers the greatest loss by its destruction, I <lb/>
            showed her that the greatest interest in its safety must <lb/>
            belong.'</p>
          <p>18. " 'Well then, Ischomachus,' said I, 'how did your wife, <lb/>
            on hearing these instructions, show herself disposed to com­ <lb/>
            ply with your wishes ? ' ‘ She assured me, Socrates,' replied <lb/>
            he, 'that I did not judge rightly of her, if I thought that I <lb/>
            was imposing on her what was disagreeable, in telling her <lb/>
            that she must take care of the property; for she remarked,' <lb/>
            said he, ‘ that it would have been more disagreeable to her if <lb/>
            I had charged her to neglect her property, than if she were re­ <lb/>
            quired to take care of the household goods. 19. For it seems to <lb/>
            be a provision of nature,' concluded he, ‘ that as it is easier for <lb/>
            a well-disposed woman to take care of her children than to <lb/>
            neglect them, so it is more pleasing (as he thought, he said), <lb/>
            for a right-minded woman to attend to her property, which, <lb/>
            as being her own, affords her gratification, than to be neglect­ <lb/>

          <p>Socrates admires the excellent character and willing submission of Ischo. <lb/>
            machus's wife. Ischomachus relates how he dissuaded his wife from <lb/>
            ostentation in dress, and made her feel that she would more effectually <lb/>
            secure his attachment, and that of others, by a faithful discharge of her <lb/>
            duties than by showiness in apparel or assumed dignity of manner.</p>
          <p>1. " ON hearing that his wife had made him such a reply," <lb/>
            proceeded Socrates, “ I said, ‘ By Juno, Ischomachus, you <lb/>
            show us that your wife is possessed of a manly understanding.' <lb/>
            ‘ And accordingly,' returned Ischomachus, ‘ I wish to give <lb/>
            you other instances of her extreme nobleness of mind, in <lb/>
            matters in which she complied with my wishes after hearing <lb/>
            them only once.' ' Of what nature were they ? ' said I; <lb/>
            ‘ pray tell us; for it is a far greater pleasure to hear of the <lb/>
            merit of a living woman, than if Zeuxis were to exhibit to me <lb/>
            the most beautiful representation of a woman in a painting.' <lb/>
            2. Ischomachus then proceeded to say, ‘ Seeing her one day, <lb/>
            Socrates, painted over with a great deal of white lead, that <lb/>
            she might appear still fairer than she really was, and with <lb/>
            a great deal of vermilion, that her complexion might seem <lb/>
            more rosy than its natural hue, and having on high-heeled <lb/>
            shoes, that she might seem tall beyond her real stature, 3. <lb/>
            “ Tell me," said I, “ my dear wife, whether you would con­ <lb/>
            sider me, as a sharer of my fortunes with you, more worthy of <lb/>
            your love, if I should show you what I really possessed, and <lb/>
            should neither boast that I have more than really belongs to <lb/>
            me, nor conceal any portion of what I have; or if, on the con­ <lb/>
            trary, I should endeavour to deceive you by saying that I <lb/>
            have more than is really mine, and by showing you counter­ <lb/>
            feit money, and necklaces of gilt wood, and purple garments <lb/>
            of a fading colour, pretending that they are of the true <lb/>
            quality?" 4. She instantly replying, said, " Hush ! may you <lb/>
            never act in such a way ; for if you were to do so, I could <lb/>
            never love you from my heart." " Then," said I, " my dear <lb/>
            wife, were we not united that we might have personal intimacy <lb/>
            with one another?" 5. " People say so at least," replied she. <lb/>
            “ Whether, then," said I, "should I seem, as an intimate asso­ <lb/>
            ciate, more worthy of your love, if, in presenting my person <pb n="113"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="§ 6-10.] "/>to you, I should take care, by paying due attention to it, that <lb/>
            it be healthy and strong, and should by that means appear to <lb/>
            you, as would really be the case, of a good complexion, or if, <lb/>
            on the contrary, I should paint myself with vermilion, tinge <lb/>
            my eye-lids with purple, and then present myself before you, <lb/>
            and associate with you, deceiving you all the time, and <lb/>
            offering you vermilion to see and touch instead of my own <lb/>
            natural skin?" 6. "Certainly," replied she, "I should not <lb/>
            touch vermilion with greater pleasure than I should touch <lb/>
            yourself, nor should I look upon purple dye with greater <lb/>
            pleasure than on your own colour, nor should I see your eyes <lb/>
            painted with greater pleasure than in their natural condition." <lb/>
            7. " Consider accordingly that I also, my dear wife,"' Ischoma­ <lb/>
            chus said that he told her, "am not better pleased with the colour <lb/>
            of white lead and red dye than with your own ; but as the <lb/>
            gods have made horses the most beautiful objects of contempla­ <lb/>
            tion to horses, oxen to oxen, and sheep to sheep, so men think <lb/>
            that the human body in its natural state is the most agree­ <lb/>
            able object of contemplation to men. 8. Such deceits may <lb/>
            indeed impose, to a certain extent, on comparative strangers, <lb/>
            without being discovered ; but if those who live together in <lb/>
            intimacy attempt to deceive one another, they must certainly <lb/>
            be found out; for they will either expose themselves when <lb/>
            they rise from their beds, before they make their toilet, or they <lb/>
            will be detected by perspiration, or will be unmasked by tears, <lb/>
            or will, assuredly, be betrayed in bathing."' 9. ' And what <lb/>
            in the name of the gods,'said I, ‘did she answer to these <lb/>
            remarks ?' ' Her only answer was,' said he, ‘ that she never <lb/>
            afterwards practised any such art, but took care to appear in <lb/>
            a natural and becoming manner. She even asked me if I <lb/>
            could recommend her any course by which she might render <lb/>
            herself really good looking, and not merely make herself be <lb/>
            thought so. 10. I then, my dear Socrates,' continued he, <lb/>
            ‘ advised her not to sit continually like a slave, but to take <lb/>
            upon herself, with the help of the gods, to preside at the loom <lb/>
            like a mistress, and to teach others what she knew better than <lb/>
            they, and to learn what she did not know so well; I recom­ <lb/>
            mended her also to overlook the bread-maker, to attend to the <lb/>
            housekeeper as she was measuring out her articles, and to go <lb/>
            about and examine whether everything was in the place in <lb/>
            which it ought to be; for such occupations, it appeared to <note type="footnote"> VOL. <unclear>if</unclear> </note> <note type="footnote"> I </note> <pb n="114"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[CH. 11."/> <lb/>
            me, would be at once a discharge of her duties and a means of <lb/>
            exercise, 11. I told her, too, that it would be good exercise <lb/>
            to wet and knead the bread, and to shake out and put up the <lb/>
            clothes and bed-coverings. I assured her that if she thus <lb/>
            exercised herself she would take her food with a better <lb/>
            appetite, would enjoy better health, and would assume a more <lb/>
            truly excellent complexion.. 12. A wife's look, indeed, <lb/>
            when it seems, compared with that of a servant, more <lb/>
            pure and healthy, and when she is dressed more be­ <lb/>
            comingly, is something attractive to a husband, especially <lb/>
            when a desire of pleasing him, instead of serving him from <lb/>

          <p>Socrates, having heard sufficient respecting the character of Ischomachus's <lb/>
            wife, requests Ischomachus to tell him how he employed his time. <lb/>
            Ischomachus gives an account of his various occupations, and the objects <lb/>
            of them.</p>
          <p>1. "I THEN said, ‘I think that I have heard sufficient, Ischo­ <lb/>
            machus, for a commencement, respecting the conduct of your <lb/>
            wife, which is indeed extremely honourable to both of you. <lb/>
            But tell me now,' I added, ‘ something of your own manage­ <lb/>
            ment, so that you may have pleasure in speaking of that from <lb/>
            which you have gained credit, and that I, having heard a full <lb/>
            account of the proceedings of an honourable and good man, <lb/>
            and having, if possible, learned something from them, may <lb/>
            feel myself much indebted to you.' 2. ‘ I will indeed give <lb/>
            you with great pleasure, Socrates,' said Ischomachus, ‘ an <lb/>
            account of what I am constantly doing, in order that you may <lb/>
            correct me, if I seem to you to do anything injudiciously.' <lb/>
            a. ‘ But how can I,' I asked, with any show of justice, correct <pb n="115"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="§ 4—8.] "/>a man whose conduct is marked by all that is noble and <lb/>
            good, especially when I am myself a person who am thought <lb/>
            to indulge in idle talk, and to measure the air,1 and, what <lb/>
            appears to be the most foolish of all calumnies, am accused of <lb/>
            being poor. 4. I should indeed be in great dejection at this <lb/>
            charge, had I not this morning, on meeting the horse of Nicias <lb/>
            the foreigner,2 seen numbers of spectators following him, and <lb/>
            heard persons holding much conversation about him ; and <lb/>
            let me tell you, I went up to the groom and asked him whether' <lb/>
            the horse was possessed of much wealth. 5. But he, looking <lb/>
            at me as if I had proved myself out of my senses by the <lb/>
            question, said, "How can a horse be possessed of wealth?" <lb/>
            So I recovered my spirits on hearing that it is possible for <lb/>
            even a poor horse to be a good one, if he has a good disposition <lb/>
            from nature. 6. On the supposition, therefore, that it is <lb/>
            possible for me also to be a good man, give me a full account of <lb/>
            your conduct, that I may begin to-morrow to imitate you in <lb/>
            whatever good I may learn while I listen; for to-morrow is <lb/>
            a good day,' said I, 'to enter upon a course of virtue.’3 <lb/>
            7. 'You are jesting, Socrates,' said Ischomachus, 'but I will <lb/>
            nevertheless tell you what I endeavour to pass my life, as far <lb/>
            as I can, in studying; 8. for as I think I have learned that <lb/>
            the gods have made it impossible for men to prosper without <lb/>
            knowing what they ought to do, and taking care that their <lb/>
            duties be performed, and that of those who are prudent and. <lb/>
            diligent the gods grant prosperity to some, and not to others ; <lb/>
            I therefore begin by offering adoration to the gods, and I <lb/>
            endeavour to act in such a manner while I pray to them, that <lb/>
            it may be possible for me to enjoy health and strength of body, <lb/>

            creased.' 9. I, nearing this, said, ‘ Is it then an object with <lb/>
            you, Ischomachus, that you may be rich, and that, having a <lb/>
            large fortune, you may have also the trouble of taking care of <lb/>
            it ?’ ‘ Certainly,' replied Ischomachus, ‘ I have a desire for that <lb/>
            wealth about which you ask ; for it appears a great pleasure <lb/>
            to me to pay rich offerings to the gods, to assist my friends, <lb/>
            if they have need of aid, and to take care that the city may <lb/>
            not be unadorned for want of money, as far as I am concerned.' <lb/>
            10. ‘ Assuredly, Ischomachus,' said I, ‘ the objects which you <lb/>
            mention are honourable, and suitable to a man in a highly <lb/>
            influential position ; for how can it be otherwise ? since there <lb/>
            are many who cannot live without looking to the assistance <lb/>
            of others, and many must be content if they can procure what <lb/>
            is barely sufficient to sustain them. But as for those who <lb/>
            are able not only to manage their own households, but to se­ <lb/>
            cure a superfluity, so as to adorn the city, and to relieve their <lb/>
            friends, must we not regard them as men of great substance <lb/>
            and influence? 11. Many of us, indeed,' continued I, ‘ are <lb/>
            able to extol such men ; but do you tell me, my dear Ischoma­ <lb/>
            chus, commencing with what you mentioned first, how you <lb/>
            take care of your health; how you keep up your bodily <lb/>
            strength ; how it is possible for you to preserve yourself <lb/>
            honourably in time of war; and, after you have spoken on <lb/>
            these points, it will be satisfactory to hear what you say <lb/>
            respecting the means of increasing your fortune.' 12. 4All <lb/>
            these things, my good Socrates,' rejoined Ischomachus, ‘ are, <lb/>
            as it appears to me, naturally connected with one another; for <lb/>
            after a man has taken sufficient to eat, health seems to be a <lb/>
            surer attendant on him when he works it off by proper exer­ <lb/>
            cise, and his strength seems to increase as he exerts him­ <lb/>
            self; if he practises military exercises, he is likely to secure <lb/>
            his safety with greater honour; and, if he pays due attention <lb/>
            to his affairs, and does not relax into idleness, there will be the <lb/>
            greater probability that his substance will be increased.' <lb/>
            13. ‘ So far I follow you, Ischomachus,' said I, ‘ when you . <lb/>
            say that a man who is industrious and careful, and takes <lb/>
            exercise, secures certain advantages ; but what sort of labour <lb/>
            you adopt to keep up your constitution and strength, how you <lb/>
            exercise yourself for war, and what methods you pursue to <lb/>
            secure a superabundance of income, so that you may assist <lb/>
            your friends, and add to the resources of the commonwealth, <pb n="117"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="§ 14-20.] "/>are points,' said I, 'which I would gladly learn from you.' <lb/>
            14. 'I accustom myself, then, Socrates,' said Ischomachus, <lb/>
            ‘ to rise from my bed at an hour when I am likely to find any <lb/>
            one whom I may want to see still at home. If I have to do <lb/>
            any business in the city, I have the advantage of a walk while <lb/>
            I am going upon it. 15. Or if I have no business of conse­ <lb/>
            quence in the city, my servant takes my horse into the fields: <lb/>
            and I, by the walk along the road into the country, perhaps <lb/>
            get more benefit than I should get if I were to walk under a <lb/>
            covered colonnade.1 16. When I reach the open fields, I <lb/>
            then, whether my workmen happen to be planting trees, or <lb/>
            turning up the soil, or sowing, or gathering in the produce, <lb/>
            observe how everything is going on, and suggest alterations <lb/>
            if I think of anything better than what is being done. 17. <lb/>
            After this, I generally mount my horse, and go through <lb/>
            equestrian exercises as similar as possible to those necessarily <lb/>
            practised in war, avoiding neither cross roads,2 nor acclivities, <lb/>
            nor ditches, nor streams of water; but I take care, as far as is <lb/>
            in my power, not to lame my horse while he is engaged in <lb/>
            these exercises. 18. When this is over, the servant lets the <lb/>
            horse roll himself about, and then takes him home, carrying <lb/>
            with him whatever we want from the fields into the town ; <lb/>
            whilst I return home, sometimes at a walking pace, and some­ <lb/>
            times running, and then clear off the perspiration with the <lb/>
            strigil.3 I next take my morning meal, Socrates, eating just <lb/>
            so much as neither to pass the day empty nor over full.' 4 <lb/>
            19. 'By Jupiter, my dear Ischomachus,' said I, ‘you do all <lb/>
            this in such a way as to have my approbation at least; for to <lb/>
            occupy yourself, at the same time, in arrangements for the <lb/>
            improvement of your health and strength, in exercises suited <lb/>
            to war, and in cares for the advancement of your fortune, <lb/>
            seems to me in the highest degree admirable. 20. You give us <note type="footnote">1 The Athenians were accustomed to walk, for health or pleasure, in <lb/>

            continued he, ‘I am by many persons very greatly calumni­ <lb/>
            ated ;—you perhaps thought that I was going to say that I am, <lb/>
            by many, called an honourable and excellent man.' 22. <lb/>
            ‘ Yes ; but I was going to ask you this, too, Ischomachus,' <lb/>
            said I, ‘ whether you make it at all your care that you may be <lb/>
            able to give an account of your actions, and to require from <lb/>
            others an account of theirs, if it be necessary to require <lb/>
            such account from any one.' ‘ Do I not appear to you, <lb/>
            Socrates,' replied he, ‘ to be constantly meditating on this <lb/>
            very subject, to be able to.justify myself by showing that I <lb/>
            injure no man, and that I do good to many, as far as I can ? <lb/>
            and do I not appear to you to make it my study how to accuse <lb/>
            people, when I see many doing wrong to individuals, and some <lb/>
            to the state, and not one doing good 23. If you also <lb/>
            meditate interpreting what you say, Ischomachus,' said I, <lb/>
            ‘ tell me, in addition, what it is you mean.' ‘I never cease, <lb/>
            then, Socrates,' continued he, ‘to exercise myself in speak­ <lb/>
            in- ; for I either listen to one of my servants accusing another, <lb/>
            or defending himself, and try to refute what is not true ; or I <lb/>
            complain of some person, or commend him, to his friends; or <lb/>
            I seek to reconcile some of my acquaintances, by endeavour­ <lb/>
            in- to convince them how much better it is for them to be <lb/>
            friends rather than enemies. 24. Or, when we 1 are in com­ <lb/>

          <p>Socrates expresses his fear that he was detaining Ischomachus from his busi­ <lb/>
            ness ; Ischomachus replies that he had left his affairs under the superin­ <lb/>
            tendence of a bailiff, and proceeds to give an account of the office and <lb/>
            duties of a bailiff or overseer, and the qualities necessary to the formation <lb/>
            of a good one. But the master's personal superintendence must never be <lb/>
            long withheld.</p>
          <p>1. “ ‘ BUT,' said I, ‘ let me not detain you, my dear Ischo­ <lb/>
            machus, if you now wish to go away.' ‘ You are not detaining <lb/>
            me, I assure you, Socrates,' said he, ‘ since I should not go <lb/>
            away until the business of the market is altogether at an end.' <lb/>
            2. ‘ Undoubtedly,' replied I, ‘ for you are extremely cautious <lb/>
            that you may not lose your title,. that of an upright and lion­ <lb/>
            ourable man ; and thus, though perhaps many things require <lb/>
            your attention, yet, as you made an agreement with the <lb/>
            strangers, you still wait for them, that you may not disappoint <lb/>
            them.'2 ‘ Those many things, however, to which you allude, <lb/>
            my dear Socrates, are not neglected,' replied Ischomachus, <lb/>
            ‘ for I have bailiffs in my fields.' 3. ‘ And whether,' said I, <lb/>
            ‘Ischomachus, when you want a bailiff, do you, after having <lb/>
            ascertained if there is anywhere a man fit for a bailiff, proceed <lb/>
            to hire him (as, when you want a carpenter, you recollect if <lb/>

            your bailiffs by instructing them yourself ?' 4. ' I myself <lb/>
            assuredly, my dear Socrates,' he replied, ‘ endeavour to in­ <lb/>
            struct them ; for what else ought he who is to be qualified <lb/>
            to attend to my business in my stead, whenever I am absent, <lb/>
            to know, but what I myself know ? and if I myself am fit to <lb/>
            have charge of the business, I may certainly teach another <lb/>
            what I myself understand.' 5. ‘ Then, in the first place,' <lb/>
            said I, ‘ it will be proper for him to entertain good feelings <lb/>
            towards you and yours, if he is to supply your place properly <lb/>
            when he attends to your business instead of yourself ; for <lb/>
            without a good disposition, what profit would there be from <lb/>
            any knowledge in a bailiff whatsoever ? ’ ‘ None, certainly,' <lb/>
            replied Ischomachus ; ‘ but I endeavour, first of all, to teach <lb/>
            them to feel well disposed towards me, and what concerns me.' <lb/>
            6. ‘ And how, in the name of the gods,' said I, ‘ do you teach <lb/>
            whomsoever you please, to feel well disposed to you and what <lb/>
            concerns you ?' ‘ By doing them some good,' replied Ischo­ <lb/>
            machus, 'whenever the gods give me an abundant supply of <lb/>
            anything that is good.' 7. &lt; You say this, then,' said I, ' that <lb/>
            those who profit by your good fortune become attached to you, <lb/>
            and wish to do you some good.' 'I see, indeed, Socrates, <lb/>
            that this is the best means of securing attachment.' 8. ' But <lb/>
            if a person becomes well affected towards you, Ischomachus,' <lb/>
            said I, ‘ will he on that account be sufficiently qualified to act <lb/>
            as a bailiff for you ? Do you not see that though all men, so <lb/>
            to speak, are well affected towards themselves, there are yet <lb/>
            many of them who are not willing to take the requisite care <lb/>
            that the good things which they desire may fall to their lot ? <lb/>
            9. ‘ But, I assure you,' said Ischomachus, ‘ when I wish to <lb/>
            make such persons bailiffs, I also teach them to be careful.' <lb/>
            10. ‘ How, in the name of the gods?' said I; ‘for I thought <lb/>
            that to make a man careful did not fall under the province of <lb/>
            teaching.' ‘ Nor is it indeed possible, Socrates,' said he, ‘to <lb/>
            teach all men, without exception,1 to be careful.' 11. ‘ What <lb/>
            sort of men, then,' said I, 'is it possible to teach ? Point <lb/>
            them out to me clearly, by all means.' ‘ In the first place, <lb/>
            Socrates,' replied he, ‘ you would not be able to make such <lb/>
            as are intemperate in wine careful, for intoxication induces <lb/>
            forgetfulness of everything that is necessary for them to do.' <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἘΦεξη̃ς</foreign>—<foreign xml:lang="grc">πάντας</foreign>.] " All one after another, i. e. all without any or <lb/>

            12. ‘Are then those only,' said I, ‘ who are intemperate in <lb/>
            this particular, incapable of becoming careful, or are there any <lb/>
            others besides ?’ ‘Yes, indeed,' replied Ischomachus, 'those <lb/>
            who indulge immoderately in sleep; for he who is sunk in <lb/>
            drowsiness can neither do what he ought himself, nor render <lb/>
            others able to do it.' 13. ‘ What, then,' said I again, ‘will <lb/>
            these only be incapable of being taught this carefulness, or <lb/>
            will there be others in addition to these ?’ ‘ Those, too, <lb/>
            said Ischomachus, ‘ who are immoderately given to sensuality, <lb/>
            appear to be incapable of being taught to care for anything <lb/>
            else more than for it. 14. For neither is it easy to find any <lb/>
            subject of contemplation or solicitude more agreeable than that <lb/>
            of love; nor, when attention to business is necessary, is it easy <lb/>
            to find a severer punishment for them than detention from the <lb/>
            beloved object. Whomsoever, therefore, I observe to be of <lb/>
            such a character, I abstain from even attempting to render <lb/>
            careful.' 15. And as to those,’ said I, 'who are greedy of <lb/>
            gain, are they incapable of being instructed to pay attention to <lb/>
            business in the fields?’ ‘ No, by Jupiter,' replied Ischoma­ <lb/>
            chus, ‘ by no means ; for they are very easy to be brought to <lb/>
            give attention to such matters ; since nothing else is necessary <lb/>
            for the purpose but merely to show them that the employment <lb/>
            is profitable.' 16. 'And as to others, moreover,' said I, 'if they <lb/>
            are temperate in what you require, and are but moderately <lb/>
            desirous of gain, how do you teach them to be careful in that <lb/>
            in which you wish them to be so ?' ' By a very simple method, <lb/>
            Socrates,' replied he ; ‘ for when I see them attentive to their <lb/>
            business, I commend them, and endeavour to bestow some dis­ <lb/>
            tinction on them ; but when I observe them negligent, I study <lb/>
            to say or do something that may hurt their feelings.' it. <lb/>
            ' Well, then, Ischomachus,' added I,‘ to divert our discourse <lb/>
            a little from those who are taught to attend to business, tell <lb/>
            me, with regard to the teaching itself, whether it is possible <lb/>
            that he who is himself careless should render others careful.' <lb/>
            18. 'No, certainly,' replied Ischomachus, 'no more than it is <lb/>
            possible for one who is ignorant of music to render others <lb/>
            skilful in music ; for it is hard, when a teacher shows a thing <lb/>
            imperfectly, to learn from him to do it well; and if a master <lb/>
            gives an example of negligence, it is not to be expected that <lb/>
            the servant will be careful. 19. To speak briefly, I do not <lb/>
            think that I have ever observed the servants of a bad master <pb n="122"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[CH. 13."/> <lb/>
            conduct themselves well; I have. however, seen the servants <lb/>
            of a good master conduct themselves ill, but not without de­ <lb/>
            triment to him. But whoever wishes to make his servants <lb/>
            capable of attending to his work must be careful to overlook <lb/>
            and inspect what they do, and to be ready to bestow some re­ <lb/>
            ward upon any one that is the cause of things being well done, <lb/>
            as well as not to shrink from inflicting a proper penalty on <lb/>
            any one that is negligent. 20. The reply attributed to the <lb/>
            barbarian,' added Ischomachus, ‘ appears to me to be ex­ <lb/>
            ceedingly to the purpose; for when the king of Persia, having <lb/>
            met with a fine horse, and wishing to have it fattened as soon <lb/>
            as possible, asked one of those who were considered knowing <lb/>
            about horses, what would fatten a horse soonest, it is said that <lb/>
            he answered, " the master's eye.”1 So, Socrates,' concluded he, <lb/>
            'the master's eye seems to me to have the most effect in render­ <lb/>

          <p>Bailiffs or overseers must be instructed how their several duties are to be. <lb/>

          <p>l. " ‘ BUT when you have impressed upon any person,' said I, <lb/>
            ‘ and impressed with great earnestness, that he must attend to <lb/>
            that to which you desire him to attend, will he be at once quali­ <lb/>
            fled to take the office of bailiff, or is there anything else that <lb/>
            he must learn, if he means to be an able bailiff?' 2. ' Yes, <lb/>
            indeed,' replied Ischomachus, ‘ there is something else ; for it <lb/>
            remains for him to know what he must do, and when, and <lb/>
            how ; for if he does not learn this, what profit would there be <lb/>
            from a bailiff without such knowledge, any more than from a <lb/>
            physician who should attend upon a sick person, visiting him <lb/>
            morning and evening, but should be ignorant what to do for <lb/>
            the benefit of his patient.' 3. ‘ And if he has learned how his <lb/>
            various works are to be done, will there be need of anything <note type="footnote"> I The same anecdote is mentioned by Aristotle, CEcon. c. 6. So Cato <lb/>

            further,’ said I, ‘ or will he then be a thoroughly accomplished <lb/>
            bailiff for you?' 'I think,' he replied, 'that he must at least learn <lb/>
            how to direct the workmen.' 4. ‘ Do you then instruct your <lb/>
            balliffs,’ said I, 'that they may be qualified for directing <lb/>
            others ? 'I try to do so at least,' said Ischomachus. ‘ And <lb/>
            how, in the name of the gods,' I asked, ' do you teach them <lb/>
            to be able to direct men ? In a very poor way, indeed, Socra­ <lb/>
            tes,' replied he, ‘ so that you may perhaps laugh at it when <lb/>
            you hear it.' 5. ‘ Such a matter,' returned I, ‘does not de­ <lb/>
            serve to be laughed at, my dear Ischomachus ; for whoever is <lb/>
            able to render persons qualified to direct men, is evidently able <lb/>
            to teach them how to govern men; and whoever can teach <lb/>
            them to govern, can also qualify them to become kings ; so <lb/>
            that he who can do this appears to me deserving, not of deri­ <lb/>
            sion, but of great praise.' 6. ' Other animals, then, Socrates,' <lb/>
            continued he, ' learn to obey under the influence of two <lb/>
            things; from being punished when they attempt to be diso­ <lb/>
            bedient, and from being treated with kindness when they obey <lb/>
            cheerfully. 7. Colts, for instance, learn to obey those who <lb/>
            break them in, by finding something pleasant happen to them <lb/>
            when they are obedient, and when they are disobedient, by <lb/>
            experiencing some trouble, until they submit to the will of <lb/>
            the breaker. 8. Puppies, too, which are far inferior to man <lb/>
            in understanding as well as tongue, are nevertheless taught <lb/>
            to run in a circle, to dive in the watery and to do many other <lb/>
            things, in the very same manner ; for when they obey, they <lb/>
            receive something for which they have a desire ; and when <lb/>
            they are careless, they are punished. 9. As for men, it is <lb/>
            possible to render them more obedient by argument, showing <lb/>
            them that it is for their advantage to obey. With respect to <lb/>
            slaves, that mode of instruction which is similar to that of <lb/>
            brutes is of the greatest effect in teaching them to be obedi­ <lb/>
            ent ; for if you provide for their bellies, so as to gratify their <lb/>
            appetites, you may succeed in getting much from them. But <lb/>
            ambitious natures are excited by praise ; for some dispositions <lb/>
            thirst for praise no less than others for meat and drink. 10. <lb/>
            While I teach, therefore, those whom I wish to make bailiffs, the <lb/>
            rules which I observe myself in the expectation of finding <lb/>
            people more obedient to me, I second their efforts also in the <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κυβιστα̃ν</foreign>. J So Zeune interprets the word; but it may meaT.., “ to turn <lb/>

            following ways: I take care that the clothes and the shoes, <lb/>
            which I have to furnish for the workmen, may not be all <lb/>
            alike, but some worse and some better, that there may be op­ <lb/>
            portunity for distinguishing the better labourer with the better <lb/>
            garments, while I give those of inferior value to the less <lb/>
            deserving. 11. For extreme despondency, Socrates,' con­ <lb/>
            tinued he, ‘ appears to be produced in the meritorious, when <lb/>
            they see that the work is done by themselves, and that they <lb/>
            obtain only a like recompense with those who are neither <lb/>
            willing to work nor to submit to any risk when necessity calls <lb/>
            upon them. I myself, therefore, never by any means consider <lb/>
            the better workmen as deserving only of equal recompense <lb/>
            with the worse, and I commend my overseers whenever I see <lb/>
            them distributing the best articles among the most praiseworthy <lb/>
            labourers; but if I observe any one distinguished in consequence <lb/>
            of flatteries or any other profitless service, I do not overlook <lb/>
            the abuse, but reprimand the bailiff, and endeavour to teach <lb/>
            him, Socrates, that he is not doing what is for his own interest'</p>

          <p>How bailiffs and others should be induced to observe honesty.</p>
          <p>1. " 'BUT when your overseer, Ischomachus,' proceeded I, <lb/>
            has become qualified to manage others, so as to render them <lb/>
            tractable, do you consider that he is then become a <lb/>
            thoroughly qualified officer ; or does he, who has the ac­ <lb/>
            complishments which you have mentioned, need any additional <lb/>
            good qualities ?' 2. Indeed he does,' replied Ischomachus; <lb/>
            ‘ for instance, to abstain from taking liberties with his master's <lb/>
            property, and from thieving; for if he who has the manage­ <lb/>
            ment of the crops should dare to make away with them clan­ <lb/>
            destinely, so as not to leave as much as will be a recompense <lb/>
            for the labour, what profit would it be to cultivate the land <lb/>
            under his superintendence ?’ 3. ' Do you, then,' said I, <lb/>
            'undertake to teach the observance of honesty?' 'Certainly, <lb/>
            replied Ischomachus, ' but I do not find all listen promptly to <lb/>
            such teaching. 4. Taking some things, however, from the <pb n="125"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="§ 5-10.]"/> <lb/>
            laws of Draco, and some from tnose of Solon, I endeavour to <lb/>
            bring my servants to honesty; for these lawgivers,' added he, <lb/>
            ‘ appear to me to have made many of their laws for the pur­ <lb/>
            pose of inculcating such integrity, 5. since it is written in <lb/>
            them that persons are to be punished for thefts, and that those <lb/>
            who attempt them, if they be caught in the fact, are to be <lb/>
            put in prison, or put to death. It is plain, therefore, that they <lb/>
            wrote such laws with a view to render dishonest gains profit­ <lb/>
            less to knaves. 6. Adopting some things, accordingly, from <lb/>
            these laws,' continued he, 'and borrowing others from the <lb/>
            laws of the king of Persia,1 I strive to render my servants <lb/>
            honest in regard to what they have under their management; <lb/>
            7. for the laws of Draco and Solon only prescribe penalties for <lb/>
            those who do wrong, but the laws of the king of Persia not <lb/>
            only punish those who do amiss, but reward those who do <lb/>
            right; so that many, even though they are very greedy of <lb/>
            gain, yet, as they see that the honest become richer than the <lb/>
            dishonest, adhere very carefully to abstinence from dishonesty. <lb/>
            s. But those whom I observe,' added he, ‘ attempting, not­ <lb/>
            withstanding they are well treated, to practise dishonesty, I <lb/>
            set aside entirely from all trusty as being incorrigible knaves. <lb/>
            9. Those, on the contrary, whom I perceive not only priding <lb/>
            themselves on having more than others through their honesty, <lb/>
            but manifesting a desire to receive praise from me, I treat at <lb/>
            once as freedmen; not only enriching them, but honouring them <lb/>
            as good and upright persons ; 10. for it is in this, Socrates,' he <lb/>
            concluded, ‘ that a man desirous of honours differs from a <lb/>
            man fond of gain, in being willing, namely, to labour, or to <lb/>
            meet danger, when it is necessary, for the sake of praise and <lb/>
            distinction, and to abstain from disgraceful means of lucre.' <note type="footnote">1 Twv <foreign xml:lang="grc">Βασιλικω̄ν νόμων</foreign>.] As the king of Persia is called King, <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατ</foreign>’ <lb/>

          <p>Ischomachus now proceeds, at the request of Socrates, to give instructions <lb/>
            on the various departments of agriculture. He shows that it is easy to be <lb/>
            learned; and that those who are employed in it are very ready to com­ <lb/>
            municate their knowledge of it, differing greatly in this respect from <lb/>
            persons employed in handicraft trades. Socrates expresses his pleasure <lb/>
            at what Ischomachus has said, and desires to hear more.</p>
          <p>1. WELL, then,' said I, 'when you have implanted in a <lb/>
            person the desire that prosperity may attend you, when you <lb/>
            have inspired him also with an anxiety that profit may be <lb/>
            secured for you, when, in addition to this, you have furnished <lb/>
            him with knowledge how every kind of work may be done, so <lb/>
            as to be rendered more lucrative, when you have rendered <lb/>
            him, moreover, able to direct others, and when, last of all, you <lb/>
            have made him produce the fruits of the earth for you in as <lb/>
            great abundance as you would produce them for yourself, I <lb/>
            will no longer ask, concerning such a man, whether he still re­ <lb/>
            quires any additional good quality ; for an overseer who is <lb/>
            thus accomplished appears to me to be of the very highest <lb/>
            value. Do not, however, omit this point, Ischomachus,' said <lb/>
            I, ‘ which has been very lightly passed over in our dis­ <lb/>
            course.' 'What is it ?’ said Ischomachus. 2. 'You said,' <lb/>
            replied I, ‘ that it was a most important matter to learn how <lb/>
            it is necessary to do every kind of work ; else, if a person <lb/>
            did not know what he ought to do, and how he ought to do <lb/>
            it, you observed that there would be no profit even in diligence. <lb/>
            3. The other observations of yours, Ischomachus,' said I, ‘ I <lb/>
            think I understand well enough ; I mean what you said as to <lb/>
            the mode in which it is proper to instruct the overseer; for <lb/>
            I seem to comprehend how, as you said, you render him well <lb/>
            disposed towards you, and careful, and fit to direct others, and <lb/>
            honest. 4. But as to that which you said besides, that it <lb/>
            is necessary for him who would attend to agriculture properly <lb/>
            to learn what he must do, and how he must do it, and at what <lb/>
            season he must do each particular thing, we seem to have <lb/>
            passed it over in our conversation somewhat too lightly. <lb/>
            5. It was as if you should say that he who would be able to <lb/>
            write down anything dictated to him must know letters, and <pb n="127"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="§ 6-12.] "/>be able to read anything written ; for, after having heard this <lb/>
            from you, I should have heard that such a person must know <lb/>
            letters; but though I should have learned this, I should not, <lb/>
            on that account, I believe, know anything more of letters myself. <lb/>
            6. So now, also, I am very well convinced, that he who would <lb/>
            conduct agriculture properly must understand it; yet, though I <lb/>
            know this, I do not know at all the more how I must conduct <lb/>
            agriculture. 7. If I should proceed at once, therefore, to <lb/>
            manage a farm, I should think myself like a quack, who <lb/>
            should go about and visit patients without knowing what <lb/>
            would do them good. That I may not, then, act in such a <lb/>
            manner,' added I, 'pray instruct me in the duties of agri­ <lb/>
            culture.'</p>
          <p>8. "Ischomachus then said, 'Do you wish me, Socrates, to <lb/>
            teach you at once the very art of agriculture itself?' , As­ <lb/>
            suredly,’ said I; ‘ for it is an art that renders those who under­ <lb/>
            stand it rich, and leaves those who do not understand it, <lb/>
            however much they labour in it, to live in poverty.' 9. ‘ You <lb/>
            shall now hear, then, Socrates,' said he, 'how friendly the <lb/>
            character of this art is to mankind ; for, inasmuch as it is <lb/>
            most useful, most pleasant to pursue, most becoming, and most <lb/>
            agreeable to gods and men, and as it is also most easy to learn, <lb/>
            how can it be otherwise than of a noble character ? For <lb/>
            among animals, I may observe, we call such as are beautiful, <lb/>
            and large, and serviceable, and gentle to the hand of man, <lb/>
            noble. 10. Nor is agriculture, Socrates,' continued he, ' so <lb/>
            difficult to learn as other arts, the students of which must <lb/>
            almost wear themselves out before they can do enough in them <lb/>
            to gain support; but, partly by seeing others at work, partly <lb/>
            by hearing from them, you may soon learn enough even to <lb/>
            teach another, if you wish. I think, too,' he added, ‘ that <lb/>
            you understand a good deal of it, without being aware; 11. for <lb/>
            those who practise other arts conceal, in some degree, the <lb/>
            most important particulars which each knows in his particular <lb/>
            art; but, among husbandmen, he who plants trees best will <lb/>
            be best pleased if another person looks on while he is <lb/>
            planting, and he who sows best will have the same feeling; <lb/>
            and whatever you ask him about anything that is well done, <lb/>
            he will have no concealments from you as to the way in which <lb/>
            he did it. 12. So that agriculture is of a nature to render <lb/>
            those who are occuDied with it extremely generous as to their <pb n="128"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[CH. 16."/> <lb/>
            dispositions.’ 13. ‘ The preface,' said I, ‘is excellent, and <lb/>
            not of a character to deter him who hears it from questioning <lb/>
            the speaker ; and do you, as it is easy to learn the art, <lb/>
            explain it, for that reason, the more fully to me ; for it is not <lb/>
            unbecoming to you to teach what is easy, but it would be <lb/>

          <p>Ischomachus makes remarks on the nature of various soils; the art of dis­ <lb/>
            tinguishing them; and the modes and seasons of cleansing and cultivating <lb/>
            land.</p>
          <p>1. “‘IN the first place, then, Socrates,' said Ischomachus, <lb/>
            ‘ I wish to let you know, that that point in agriculture which <lb/>
            those who descant on it very nicely in words, but have no <lb/>
            practical experience, represent as a' matter of great skill, is <lb/>
            not at all difficult to understand ; for they say that he who <lb/>
            would practise husbandry successfully ought first to know <lb/>
            the nature of the soil.' 2. ‘Yet, surely,' said I, ‘they assert <lb/>
            this not without reason; for he who does not know what the <lb/>
            soil can produce, would not know, I suppose, either what he <lb/>
            ought to sow or what to plant.' 3. ' However,' said Ischoma­ <lb/>
            chus, ' it is possible to ascertain, from looking at one's neigh­ <lb/>
            bour's ground, what it can bear and what it cannot, if we only <lb/>
            observe the corn and the trees upon it; and when a person <lb/>
            has learned this, there is no further use in fighting against <lb/>
            nature, for he would not obtain a greater supply of provisions <lb/>
            by sowing or planting what he himself might require, <lb/>
            than by sowing or planting what the earth would of its own <lb/>
            accord produce and nourish. 4. But if the land cannot show <lb/>
            its qualities, through the negligence of those who possess it, <lb/>
            it is often possible to gain a juster notion of it from an ad­ <lb/>
            joining piece of ground, than to attempt to learn it from a <lb/>
            neighbour. 5. Even if it be uncultivated, it will still show <lb/>
            its nature; for that which produces weeds of average growth <lb/>
            will, if it is properly tilled, produce also plants of average <lb/>
            growth. Thus those who are not particularly skilled in agri­ <lb/>
            culture may nevertheless discover the nature of ground.' <pb n="129"/>
             <note type="margin">§ 6—14.] </note> <lb/>
            6. 'In this respect, then, Ischomachus,' said I, 'I think that <lb/>
            I may have sufficient confidence in myself, so that I need not <lb/>
            abstain from agriculture through fear of not knowing the <lb/>
            quality of the soil. 7. For I remember, indeed,' added I, <lb/>
            'what the fishermen do, who, though engaged on the sea, and <lb/>
            not stopping to view the shore, or even slackening their <lb/>
            course, but running along by the fields at full sail, yet, when <lb/>
            they see crops on the ground, do not hesitate to give an <lb/>
            opinion on it, and to pronounce which part is good and which <lb/>
            is bad, depreciating one and extolling another; accordingly, <lb/>
            I see them express themselves in general respecting the good­ <lb/>
            ness of land in the same manner as those who are ex­ <lb/>
            perienced in agriculture.'</p>
          <p>8. “‘4 Where, then, would you wish me, Socrates,' said he, <lb/>
            'to begin to bring to your recollection matters concerning <lb/>
            agriculture ? for I am sure that I shall tell you a vast number <lb/>
            of things, as to the manner in which we must cultivate land, <lb/>
            when you already know them.' 9. ‘I think, Ischomachus,' <lb/>
            said I, ‘ that I would gladly learn first of all (for this is what <lb/>
            most concerns a philosopher), how, by cultivating the earth, <lb/>
            if I should wish to do so, I may obtain the greatest quantities <lb/>
            of barley and wheat.' 10. ‘ Do you know this, then, that we <lb/>
            must prepare fallow ground1 for sowing ?’ ‘I do know it,' <lb/>
            said I. 11. ‘Suppose we should begin, then,' said he, ‘to <lb/>
            plough the ground in the winter ?' ‘It would at that time <lb/>
            be nothing else but mud,' said I. ‘ Does it seem proper <lb/>
            to you to begin in summer, then ? ’ ‘ The soil will be very <lb/>
            hard at that season,' answered I, ‘ for the oxen.' 12. ‘ So it <lb/>
            appears that we must begin that work in the spring.' ‘ It is <lb/>
            likely,' rejoined I, ‘ that the soil, if moved at that time, will <lb/>
            be most easily spread.' ‘ And it is then that the weeds, <lb/>
            Socrates,' said he, ‘ being turned up, furnish manure for the <lb/>
            ground, while they have not yet scattered their seeds, so as to <lb/>
            produce any fresh weeds. 13. For this also, I think, it must <lb/>
            be easy for you to understand, that, if ground is to lie fallow <lb/>
            to good purpose, it ought to be free from weeds, and warmed <lb/>
            as much as possible by the sun.' ‘ Certainly,' said I, ‘ I <lb/>
            think that such must be the case.' 14. ‘And do you think <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Νεὸν</foreign>.] Land on which nothing is sown, and which is to be turned <lb/>

            that these effects can be better produced by any other means <lb/>
            than by turning up the land as often as possible during the <lb/>
            summer ? ' ‘I, indeed, am fully aware,' said I, ‘ that weeds <lb/>
            cannot be by any means more effectually kept from taking <lb/>
            root, or dried up by the heat, and that the soil cannot be more <lb/>
            effectually warmed by the sun, than by turning it up with <lb/>
            oxen in the middle of summer and in the middle of the day.' <lb/>
            15. ‘ Or if men were to make the ground fallow by turning it <lb/>
            up with the spade,' said he, ‘is it not evident that they ought <lb/>
            to keep the soil and the weeds distinct ?’1 ‘ And to throw <lb/>
            the weeds,' added I, ‘ upon the surface, that they may be <lb/>
            withered, while they turn up the soil, that the crude part of <lb/>
            it may be benefited by the warmth.’</p>

          <p>Of sowing, and the proper times for it. Different soils require different <lb/>
            quantities of seed. Of hoeing and weeding.</p>
          <p>1 " ' CONCERNING the Mowing of the ground, therefore, So­ <lb/>
            crates,' continued Ischomachus, ‘ you see that the same <lb/>
            notions are entertained by both of us.' ‘ They are, certainly,' <lb/>
            said I. ‘About the time of sowing, however, my dear So­ <lb/>
            crates,' continued he, ‘have you any other opinion than that <lb/>
            that is the time for sowing, which men of former days who <lb/>
            have tried it, and men of the present day who are still trying <lb/>
            it, have judged to be the best ? 2. For when the autumn is <lb/>
            come, all men, in a manner, look to the gods, to see when <lb/>
            they will moisten the earth, and allow them to sow.' ‘All <lb/>
            men, indeed, Ischomachus,' said I, ‘are determined upon not <lb/>
            sowing, at least willingly, when the ground is dry ; inasmuch <lb/>
            as people who had sowed before they were directed by the <lb/>
            gods, have had to struggle with many disadvantages.' 3. ‘On <lb/>
            these points, then,' said Ischomachus, ‘all men are agreed! <lb/>
            ‘Yes,' said I; 'for as to what the gods teach, it is constantly <lb/>
            the case that men are of one mind ; for instance, it is thought <note type="footnote"> 1 lIxa <foreign xml:lang="grc">δει̃ ποιει̃ν</foreign>.] To keep the weeds out of the soil; not to let <lb/>
            them take root in it again. </note> <pb n="131"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="§ 4—8.]"/> <lb/>
            by everybody alike that it is better to wear thick clothing in <lb/>
            the winter, if they can get it ; and it is thought by everybody <lb/>
            better to burn fire in the winter, if they have wood.' 4. <lb/>
            ‘ With regard to the time of sowing, however, my dear So­ <lb/>
            crates,' said Ischomachus, ' many are divided in opinion <lb/>
            as to whether the earliest, or the middle, or the latest, is the <lb/>
            best.' ‘But the gods,' said I, ‘do not order the years with <lb/>
            exact uniformity, so that one year may be best for very early <lb/>
            sowing, another for middle, another for very late.'. 5. ‘As <lb/>
            for yourself, then, Socrates,' said he, ‘whether do you think <lb/>
            it better for a man to fix on one of these times and keep to it, <lb/>
            whether he has much or little seed to sow,1 or to begin at the <lb/>
            earliest period and prolong his sowing throughout the season, <lb/>
            until the very end of it?' 6. ‘To me, indeed, Ischomachus,' <lb/>
            replied I, ‘it appears best to sow a portion at each period ; 2 <lb/>
            for I consider it far better to have a sufficient crop of corn <lb/>
            every year,3 than a great deal one year, and not enough <lb/>
            another.' ‘In this, therefore, Socrates,' said he, ‘you agree <lb/>
            with me, the learner with the teacher, and you even give <lb/>
            your opinion before I have given mine.'</p>
          <p>7. “‘But,’ said I, Ias to spreading the seed over the ground, <lb/>
            is there any artful way of doing that ?’ ‘Certainly there is, <lb/>
            Socrates,' replied he. ‘Let us give some consideration to this <lb/>
            point. That the seed must be thrown from the hand, I suppose <lb/>
            that you are pretty well aware.' ‘Yes, for I have seen <lb/>
            it thrown,' said I. ‘But some men can spread it evenly,' <lb/>
            said he, ‘and others cannot.' ‘In this respect, then,' said <lb/>
            I, ‘the hand requires exercise, like that of players on the harp, <lb/>
            that it may obey the mind.' 8. ‘Undoubtedly,' said he ; <lb/>
            ‘but what if some sorts of land be lighter, and others hea­ <lb/>
            vier ?’ ‘What is this that you say ?' returned I; 'do you <lb/>
            call that lighter which is poorer, and that heavier which is <lb/>
            richer ?’ ‘That is what I mean,' replied he ; ‘and I ask <note type="footnote"> 1 For if a farmer has much seed to sow, he has the greater need to take <lb/>
            care lest, by trusting to one time for sowing, the favourableness or unfa­ <lb/>

            each sort of land, or, if not, to which you would allow the <lb/>
            greater quantity ?' 9. ‘I think it proper,’ 1 replied I, ‘to <lb/>
            pour the greater quantity of water into the stronger wine, <lb/>
            and if there be any burdens to carry, to lay the heavier load <lb/>
            on the stronger man ; and if I had to maintain a body of men <lb/>
            in any country, I should require such of the inhabitants as had <lb/>
            the greater wealth to support the greater number. But <lb/>
            whether poor land be rendered more productive by putting <lb/>
            more corn into it, as an ox is, pray inform me.’ 10. Ischoma­ <lb/>
            chus laughed and said, ‘You are jesting, Socrates. Be <lb/>
            assured of this, however,' he proceeded, ‘that if, after you <lb/>
            have cast seed into the ground, and after the land has received <lb/>
            much nourishment from the sky, and the green corn has <lb/>
            grown up from the seed, you then turn up the soil again, the <lb/>
            crop becomes food to the ground, and vigour is produced in it <lb/>
            as from the effect of manure ; but. if you allow the land to bear <lb/>
            its crop to maturity, so as to have corn from it,2 you will see <lb/>
            that it is difficult for weak land to bring much corn to matu­ <lb/>
            rity ; just as it is difficult for a weak sow to rear a great <lb/>
            number of large pigs.' it. ‘You mean, then, Ischomachus,’ <lb/>
            said I, ‘that we must throw the smaller quantity of seed on <lb/>
            the poorer land.' ' Yes, by Jupiter, Socrates,' replied he, <lb/>
            ‘and you agree with me, as you say that you think it proper <lb/>
            to lay lighter burdens on whatever animals are weaker.'</p>
          <p>12. 'And as to hoers,' said I, ‘Ischomachus, for what <lb/>
            purpose do you send them into the corn ?’ ‘You are aware, <lb/>
            doubtless,' said he, ' that a great deal of rain falls in the <lb/>
            winter.' 'Certainly,' said I. 'Let us suppose, then, that <lb/>
            some portion of the corn is covered by the action of the rain, <lb/>
            by mud being thrown up on it, and that some of the roots are <lb/>
            laid bare by the streaming down of the water ; and weeds, we <lb/>
            may imagine, often spring up under the influence of the rain, <lb/>
            together with the corn, and choke it.' ' It is quite natural,' <lb/>
            said I, ‘that all such things should happen.' 13. ‘Does it <lb/>
            then appear to you.' said he, ‘that the corn requires any aid <lb/>
            under such circumstances ? 'Undoubtedly,' I replied. ‘By <lb/>

            bees of that which they have prepared and laid up as food for <lb/>
            themselves?’ ‘ It would be proper,' said I, ‘by Jupiter, to <lb/>
            root up the weeds, as it is proper to expel the drones from the <lb/>
            hives.' 15. ‘May we not be thought, then, with good reason, <lb/>

          <p>I. “‘AFTER this, however,' said I, ‘the next thing in course <lb/>

            that we must cut the corn.' ‘How can I but be aware ?' <lb/>
            said I. ‘When you cut it then,' said he, ‘whether do you <lb/>
            stand on the side from which the wind blows, or opposite to the <lb/>

            the threshers may not have any superfluous trouble, or the <lb/>
            winnowers anything that they do not want. As to what is <lb/>
            left on the ground, I think that if it is burned it may improve <lb/>
            the soil, or, if it is thrown in among the manure, will increase <lb/>
            the quantity of manure.' 3. ' You see then, my dear So­ <lb/>
            crates,' said he, ' how you are caught in the very fact, and <lb/>
            convicted of knowing as much about reaping as I myself <lb/>
            know.' ' I seem to do so, at least,' said I, ‘ and I would <lb/>
            wish you to examine me whether I also know anything of <lb/>
            threshing.' ‘You know, doubtless, that people thresh their <lb/>
            corn by means of working beasts.' 4. 'How can I but know?' <lb/>
            said I; ‘and I know that oxen, mules, and horses are all <lb/>
            called working beasts alike.' Do you think, then, that <lb/>
            these beasts know anything more than how to tread the corn <lb/>
            when they are driven round?' 'What else,' said I, 'can <lb/>
            beasts know ? ' 5. ‘But that they may tread out just what <lb/>
            is necessary, and that the treading may be everywhere equal, <lb/>
            to whom, Socrates,' said he, 'do you give that in charge ?’ <lb/>
            'Unquestionably,' replied I, 'to the managers of the thresh­ <lb/>
            ing ; for they, by turning the corn about, and bringing under the <lb/>
            feet of the beasts, from time to time, that part which is not <lb/>
            yet trodden, would thus most effectually, doubtless, keep the <lb/>
            threshing-floor1 level, and execute the threshing with the <lb/>
            greatest speed.' 'As to these points, then,' said lie, 'you are <lb/>
            not behind myself in knowledge.'</p>
          <p>6. “‘Then,’ said I, ‘ Ischomachus, we will now proceed to <lb/>
            clean the corn by winnowing it.' 'And tell me, Socrates,' <lb/>
            said Ischomachus, ' do you know that if you begin on the <lb/>

            over the whole floor ? 'Suci must necessarily be the case,’ <lb/>
            said I. 7. It is consequently probable that it will fall upon <lb/>
            the corn,' said he. 'It would indeed be hard,'2 returned I, <lb/>
            'for chaff to be carried over the corn into the vacant part of <lb/>
            the threshing-floor.' 'But if,' said he, 'a person should be­ <lb/>
            gin to winnow at the part opposite to the wind ?' ‘It is <lb/>

            far as the middle of the floor,2 whether will you winntw away <lb/>
            the rest of the chaff3 while the corn is still spread out, or <lb/>
            after you have collected the cleaned portion of the corn to the <lb/>
            margin of the floor,4 into as narrow a space as possible ?’ <lb/>
            ‘After having collected the cleaned corn, certainly,' said I, <lb/>
            ‘so that the chaff may be carried over into the empty part of <lb/>
            the floor, and that I may not have to winnow out the same <lb/>
            chaff wice.’ 9. 'Why, then, Socrates,' said he, 'you might <lb/>
            even teach another person how corn may be soonest win­ <lb/>
            nowed.' ‘These things, therefore,' said I, ‘I have known, <lb/>
            even for a long time, without being aware of my knowledge; <lb/>
            and I am considering whether I may not be unconsciously <lb/>
            possessed of a knowledge of refining gold, of playing on the <lb/>
            flute, and of painting ; for nobody ever taught me these, any <lb/>
            more than agriculture ; but I see men practising other arts, as <lb/>
            I also see them practising that of agriculture.'5 'Accordingly <lb/>
            I told you, some time ago,' said Ischomachus, ‘that the art of <lb/>
            agriculture was one of the noblest of arts, inasmuch as it is <lb/>
            extremely easy to learn.' ' Well,' said I, ' Ischomachus, I <lb/>
            find that it is so ; since I had gained indeed a knowledge <lb/>
            of managing grain6 without being aware that I was possessed <lb/>
            of that knowledge.' <note type="footnote"> I This receptacle seems to have been some part of the threshing-floor <lb/>

          <p>On the mode of planting trees, especially vines, figs, and olives. Nature <lb/>
            teaches us, :n many things, how we ought to act, if we will but notice <lb/>
            what is to be seen around us.</p>
          <p>1. " ‘ Is planting of trees, too,' said I, ‘a part of the art of <lb/>
            agriculture ?’ 'Assuredly it is,' replied Ischomachus. <lb/>
            ‘How is it then,' said I, ‘that I had a knowledge of what <lb/>
            relates to grain, and have no knowledge of what concerns <lb/>
            planting of trees?' 2. ‘Have you then no knowledge of it ?' <lb/>
            inquired Ischomachus. ‘ How can I have any,' rejoined I, <lb/>
            ‘when I neither know in what sort of soil I ought to plant, <lb/>
            nor how deep to dig for the tree,1 nor how wide, nor how deep <lb/>
            to put the tree in the ground, nor how a tree should be placed <lb/>
            in the earth so as to grow best.' 3. ‘Come then,' said Ischo­ <lb/>
            machus, ‘and learn what you do not know. You have seen, I <lb/>
            presume,' continued he, 'that people dig trenches in the <lb/>
            ground for trees.' ' I have indeed often seen it,' said I. <lb/>
            ' Have you ever seen any one of them deeper than three feet ?' <lb/>
            , No, by Jupiter,' replied I, ' nor deeper than two feet and a <lb/>
            half.' ‘And have you ever seen any one more than three <lb/>
            feet in breadth?' 'No indeed,' said I, ‘nor more than <lb/>
            two feet.' 4. ' Well then,' said he, ' answer me this too ; have <lb/>
            you ever seen one less than a foot in depth ?' ' No, certain­ <lb/>
            ly,' said I, ‘nor less than a foot and a half; for the young <lb/>
            trees would be uprooted in digging about them, if the roots <lb/>
            were put so small a distance below the surface.' 5. 'You <lb/>
            know this well enough, then, Socrates,' said he, ‘that men <lb/>
            do not dig for planting deeper than two feet and a half, <lb/>
            nor less deep than one foot and a half.' ‘This, indeed,' <lb/>
            said I, ‘must have fallen under my eyes, being so manifest.'</p>
          <p>6. " ‘Well, then,' continued he, ' do you know the drier and <lb/>
            moister sorts of ground when you see them ?' ‘The ground <lb/>
            about Lycabettus,2 and such as is similar to it, appears to me, <lb/>
            at least, said I, ‘to be dry ground; and that which is in the <note type="footnote">1 Breitenbach is undoubtedly right in reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῳ̃ φυτῳ̃</foreign> in this passage, <lb/>
            instead of the common reading TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">φυτὸν</foreign>. The correction is supported <lb/>

            Phalerian marsh 1 and such as resembles it, to be dry.' 7. <lb/>
            ‘Whether, then,' said he, ‘would you dig a deep pit for a <lb/>
            tree in a dry soil or in a moist one?' ‘In a dry soil, <lb/>
            assuredly,' answered I; 'for if you dig deep in a wet soil, you <lb/>
            will come to water, and you will then be unable to plant your <lb/>
            trees in the water.' ‘You seem to me to answer well,' said <lb/>
            he; ‘but when your pits are dug, have you ever observed <lb/>
            when you must plant the several kinds of trees?’ 2 8. <lb/>
            ‘ Certainly,' said 1.3 ‘When you wish them to grow up, <lb/>
            then, as quick as possible, whether do you think that the <lb/>
            sprout from the cutting of a vine, for instance, if you put it <lb/>
            under well-dug earth, would shoot up sooner through such <lb/>
            soft ground, or through undug earth against hard ground ?’ <lb/>
            ‘ It is evident,' replied I, ' that it would shoot up through <lb/>
            dug sooner than through undug ground.' 9. ‘A layer of <lb/>
            earth should then be put under the plant ? How can it <lb/>
            be otherwise?' said I. 'But whether do you think that if <lb/>
            you place the cutting quite upright, pointing towards the <lb/>
            heaven, it would thus take root better, or if you place it a <lb/>
            little obliquely5 in the earth thrown in beneath the surface, <lb/>
            so that it may lie like a gamma turned up?'6 10. ‘In the <lb/>
            latter way, certainly ; for so there would be more buds under <lb/>
            the earth ; and as it is from buds that I see shoots spring above <lb/>
            the ground, I suppose that the buds which are below the <lb/>
            ground produce also shoots in like manner? And when <lb/>
            many shoots take root in the ground, I conclude that the plant <lb/>
            will spring up quickly and with great vigour.' 11. ‘Concern- <note type="footnote"> 1 A marsh in the <foreign xml:lang="grc">δη̃μος</foreign> called Phaleros or Phalereus, which was in the <lb/>

            likely that Ischomachus, after what he had said, would ask Socrates <lb/>

            ing these points, then, said he, ‛ you entertain the same <lb/>
            notions with myself.' ‛ But would you merely heap up the <lb/>
            earth around the plant, or tread it down hard ?’ ‛I would <lb/>
            tread it down,' said I, ‛ assuredly ; for if it were not trodden <lb/>
            down, I am well aware that the untrodden earth; if wetted by <lb/>
            rain, would be turned into mud, and, if scorched by the sun, <lb/>
            would become dry to the very bottom; so that there would be <lb/>
            danger lest the roots of the plant, under a prevalence of wet <lb/>
            weather, should be rotted by damp, or should be scorched up <lb/>
            in hot weather, from the roots being heated through the dry-; <lb/>
            ness or porousness of the earth.'</p>
          <p>12. ‟ About the planting of vines, then, Socrates,' continued <lb/>
            he, ‛ you think in every respect exactly as I do.' ‛ And <lb/>
            is it proper,' said I, ‛to plant the fig-tree in the same way?' <lb/>
            ‛ I think so,' said Ischomachus, ‛ and all other sorts of fruit- <lb/>
            trees ;1 for of that which is right with regard to the planting <lb/>
            of vines, why should you consider any part as inapplicable to <lb/>
            the planting of other trees?' 13. ‛ But with respect to the. <lb/>
            olive, Ischomachus,' said I, ‛ how shall we plant it?' ‛ You <lb/>
            are trying me as to this matter also,' replied he, ‛ when you <lb/>
            know extremely well; for you observe, undoubtedly, that a <lb/>
            deeper trench is dug for the olive, as it is dug chiefly by the <lb/>
            way-sides ; you observe that there are stumps2 to each of the <lb/>
            plants ; and you see that moist earth3 is laid at the tops of all <lb/>
            the roots, and that that part of the stem which is at the sur­ <lb/>
            face of the ground is covered.' 14. ‛ All this I see,' said I. <lb/>
            ‛ And as you see it,' said he, ‛ what part of it do you not un­ <lb/>
            derstand ? As to the shell,4 for instance, my dear Socrates, <lb/>
            do you not know how to place it on the moist earth ?' ‛ In­ <lb/>

            how it was that when you asked me briefly, a little while <lb/>
            ago,1 whether I understood the planting of trees, I said I did <lb/>
            not understand it. I did not think, however, that I should <lb/>
            be able to say anything as to the method of planting trees. <lb/>
            But when you proceed to question me as to each particular <lb/>
            point, I answer you. as you say, agreeably to what you, who <lb/>
            are called a skilful agriculturist, think. 15. Is interrogation, <lb/>
            then, Ischomachus,' added I, ‛ a mode of teaching ? for I am <lb/>
            now learning,' said I, ‛ the several particulars about which <lb/>
            you question me; since, leading me through what I know, <lb/>
            and pointing out something similar to it, which I did not <lb/>
            think that I knew, you persuade me, I imagine, that I know <lb/>
            that also.' 16. ‛ Then,' said Ischomachus, ‛if I were to a?k <lb/>
            you also about a piece of money, whether it is good or not, <lb/>
            might I not persuade you that you know how to distinguish <lb/>
            good from counterfeit money ? Or might I not persuade you, <lb/>
            by asking you about flute-players, that you know how to play <lb/>
            on the flute ? Or, by asking you about painters, that you <lb/>
            Know how to paint ? and similarly with regard to other <lb/>
            things.' ‛ Perhaps you might,' said I, ‛ since you have per­ <lb/>
            suaded me that I am skilful in agriculture, although I am well <lb/>
            aware that nobody has taught me that art.' 17. ‛ The case is <lb/>
            quite different from what you suppose, Socrates,' said he, 'but <lb/>
            it is as I told you some time ago; agriculture is an art so <lb/>
            kind and gentle towards mankind, that she readily makes those <lb/>
            who can see and hear skilful in her pursuits. 18. She herself,' <lb/>
            continued he, ‛ gives us many instructions how to attend on <lb/>
            her with most success. The vine, for example, running up <lb/>
            trees, wherever it has any tree near it, teaches us how to sup­ <lb/>
            port it; by spreading out its leaves, while its bunches are yet <lb/>
            tender, instructs us to cover whatever is at that season ex­ <lb/>
            posed to the sun ; 19. by shedding its leaves when it is time <lb/>
            for the grapes to become sweet by the sun's influence, <lb/>

            admonishes us to gather the fruit from it, as people pluck <lb/>

          <p>Socrates expresses his surprise that agriculture, which is so easy to be <lb/>
            learned, is pursued with so little success by many of those who engage in <lb/>
            it. Ischomachus shows that the cause of their failure is not in general <lb/>
            want of knowledge, but want of diligence and care. How the father of <lb/>
            Ischomachus used to act in farming lands.</p>
          <p>i. " UPON this I observed, ‛ How is it, then, Ischomachus, <lb/>
            that if matters concerning agriculture are so easy to be learn­ <lb/>
            ed, and all men can alike understand what they ought to do <lb/>
            in it, all do not pursue it with like success, but some live in <lb/>
            abundance and have more than they want, while others can­ <lb/>
            not procure even the necessaries of life, but run into debt?' <lb/>
            2. ‛ I will tell you,' replied Ischomachus; ‛ for it is not know­ <lb/>
            ledge, or want of knowledge, in husbandmen, that causes <lb/>
            some to be rich and others to be poor; 3. nor will you ever <lb/>
            hear a report spread that a farm has been ruined because the <lb/>
            sower cast his seed unequally, or because the planter did not <lb/>
            plant his rows of trees straight, or because, being ignorant what <lb/>
            soil would rear vines, he planted them in a soil unsuitable for <lb/>
            them, or because the farmer did not know that it is proper to <lb/>
            prepare ground for sowing by letting it lie fallow, or because <lb/>
            he did not know that it was good to mix manure with the <lb/>
            soil. 4. But it is much more common to hear it said, " The <lb/>
            man gets no subsistence from his ground, for he takes no care <lb/>
            that seed be sown in it, or that manure be put on it." Or, <lb/>
            " The man has no wine, for he takes no care to plant vines, <lb/>
            or that those which are planted may bear him fruit." Or, <lb/>
            " The man has no olives or figs; for he takes no care, nor <lb/>
            uses any effort, to have them." 5. Such are the qualities, <lb/>
            Socrates,' continued he, ‛ in which husbandmen differ from <lb/>
            one another and consequently experience different ortune, <lb/>
            much more than they differ in seeming to have found out <lb/>
            some wise or unwise contrivance for doing their work. <lb/>
            6. So some commanders are more or less successful than <lb/>
            others in certain military operations, not from difference <lb/>
            in understanding, but evidently from difference in circum­ <lb/>
            spection; for those things which all commanders, and <lb/>
            most people who are not commanders, know, some will take <pb n="141"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="§ 7-14.] "/>care to put in practice, and others will neglect them. 7. For <lb/>
            instance, all know this, that it is better for men marching <lb/>
            through an enemy's country to proceed in good order, so that <lb/>
            they may come to battle, if it should be necessary, with ad­ <lb/>
            vantage ; but though they are all aware of this, some pay <lb/>
            attention to it, and some do not. 8. All know that it is best <lb/>
            to set a watch before the camp day and night; but some take <lb/>
            care that this may be done, and others neglect it. 9. It would <lb/>
            be hard to find a commander who does not know that, when <lb/>
            his troops are to march through narrow passes, it is better to <lb/>
            secure commanding positions beforehand, than not to do so; <lb/>
            but some take the precaution to do this, and others disregard <lb/>
            it. 10. So all agriculturists say of manure, for example, that <lb/>
            it is an excellent thing for improving the soil, and see that it <lb/>
            produces itself spontaneously ; yet, though they know exactly <lb/>
            how it is got, and that it is easy to collect abundance of it, <lb/>
            some take care that it may be collected, and others take none. <lb/>
            11. The gods above send us rain, and all the hollow places be­ <lb/>
            come pools; the earth produces all manner of weeds, and he <lb/>
            that would sow must clear his land from them; and if he <lb/>
            throws those which he removes out of his way into the water, <lb/>
            time itself would form them into that material in which the <lb/>
            ground delights ; for what sort of weeds, and what sort of <lb/>
            earth indeed, will not become manure in stagnant water ? <lb/>
            12. And in what respects ground requires improvement, whe­ <lb/>
            ther it be too moist for sowing, or too much impregnated with <lb/>
            salt for planting, everybody knows, as well as how water is <lb/>
            drained off by trenches, and how the saltness of soil is cor­ <lb/>
            rected by mixing with it substances free from salt, whether <lb/>
            moist or dry; but some attend to these matters, and some do <lb/>
            not. 13. Or even if a person be utterly ignorant what the <lb/>
            ground can produce, and has had no opportunity of seeing <lb/>
            either fruits or plants from it, or even of hearing from any <lb/>
            one a true description of it, is it not much more easy for any <lb/>
            one to make trial of the earth than of a horse or of a man ? <lb/>
            for it exhibits nothing for the purpose of deceit, but sets forth <lb/>
            plainly and truly, with the utmost simplicity, what it can do <lb/>
            and what it cannot. 14. The earth seems to me to distinguish <lb/>
            very effectively the idle and the diligent among mankind, by <lb/>
            rendering everything easy to be known and learned; for it is <lb/>
            not possible in regard to agriculture, as it is in regard to other <pb n="142"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[CH. 20. "/>arts, for those who do not practise it to excuse themselves by <lb/>
            saying that they do not know it; for all know respecting the <lb/>
            earth, that when it is well treated it makes a good return. <lb/>
            to. But idleness in regard to agriculture1 is a sure proof of a <lb/>
            base mind; for no one can persuade himself that a man can <lb/>
            live without food, and he that neither knows any other lucra­ <lb/>
            tive art, nor is willing to cultivate the ground, gives evident <lb/>
            proof that he meditates to live by stealing, or plundering, or <lb/>
            begging, or that he is altogether out of his senses.' 16. He <lb/>
            observed, too, that it made a great difference as to agriculture <lb/>
            being profitable or unprofitable, when, where several work­ <lb/>
            men are employed, one farmer takes care that his workmen <lb/>
            may be the full time at their work, and another is neglectful <lb/>
            of this point; ‛ for one workman,' said he, ‛ easily makes a <lb/>
            difference in the labour of ten, by working his full time, and <lb/>
            another makes a difference in it by leaving his work before <lb/>
            the end of his time. 17. And to allow men to loiter over their <lb/>
            work through the whole day may plainly make a difference <lb/>
            of half in the whole complement of work. is. Just as in <lb/>
            travelling along a road, two men have sometimes made a dif­ <lb/>
            ference between them of a hundred stadia in two hundred, <lb/>
            through difference in speed, though both were young and in <lb/>
            good health, as the one persevered in proceeding on the <lb/>
            object for which he had started, and the other was irresolute <lb/>
            in mind, and rested himself by fountains and in the shade, <lb/>
            losing himself in contemplation, and courting gentle breezes. <lb/>
            19. So in regard to work, those labourers who apply to that <lb/>
            to which they are appointed, and those who do not, but who <lb/>
            find pretexts for not exerting themselves, and allow them­ <lb/>
            selves to trifle away their time, exhibit a great difference in <lb/>
            the execution of it. 20. To perform work well, or to attend <lb/>
            to it insufficiently, makes as much difference as to be wholly <lb/>
            industrious or wholly idle. When men are digging the <lb/>
            ground, for instance,2 in order that vines may be cleared of <note type="footnote"> I ‛<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αλλ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ ἐν γεωϱγία̢ ἐστί, κ</foreign>. r. <foreign xml:lang="grc">λ</foreign>.] Sc. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τέχνη</foreign>.This is the common <lb/>

            weeds, and dig in such a manner that the weeds spring up <lb/>
            in greater numbers and vigour than before, how can you say <lb/>
            that such work is anything but idleness?1 21. Such are the <lb/>
            causes, then, that ruin households, much more than extreme <lb/>
            want of knowledge; for when outgoings proceed constantly <lb/>
            from the family resources, and work is not done with such profit <lb/>
            as to balance the demands, we must no longer wonder if such <lb/>
            a state of things produces want instead of abundance.</p>
          <p>22. ‟‛ For those who are able to attend to their affairs, <lb/>
            however, and who will apply themselves to agriculture ear­ <lb/>
            nestly, my father both practised himself, and taught me, a <lb/>
            most successful method of making profit ;2 for he would never <lb/>
            allow me to buy ground already cultivated, but exhorted me <lb/>
            to purchase such as, from want of care or want of means in <lb/>
            those who had possessed it, was left untilled and implanted ; <lb/>
            23. as he used to say that well-cultivated land cost a great <lb/>
            sum of money, and admitted of no improvement, and he con­ <lb/>
            sidered that land which was unsusceptible of improvement <lb/>
            did not give the same pleasure to the owner as other land; <lb/>
            but he thought that whatever a person had or brought up, that <lb/>
            was continually growing better, afforded him the highest gra­ <lb/>
            tification. But nothing exhibits greater improvement than <lb/>
            ground, when it is brought from a state of neglect into one <lb/>
            of complete fertility. 24. For be assured, my dear Socrates,' <lb/>
            continued he, ‛that I myself have already made several pieces <lb/>
            of ground worth many times their former value; and while <lb/>
            this mode of proceeding is of such importance, it is also <lb/>
            so easy to learn, that, now you have once heard it, you will <lb/>
            go away as skilful in it as myself, and will communicate it, if <lb/>
            you think proper, to some other person. 25. My father, in­ <lb/>
            deed, neither learned it from anybody himself, nor was at <lb/>
            great pains in finding it out; but he used to say that from <lb/>
            his love of agriculture, and devotion to labour, he was fond <lb/>
            of having land of that nature, in order that he might have <lb/>
            something to do, and find pleasure and profit at the same <lb/>
            time; for my father, Socrates,' added he, ‛ was naturally, as <lb/>
            I consider, the most devoted to agriculture of all the inhabit- <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πω̃ς</foreign> 1ovTUQ OVK apyov hv &lt;py)oaiQ flVaL ;] With apyov Weiske un­ <lb/>

            ants of Athens.' 26. Hearing him say this, I then put this <lb/>
            question to him: ‛ Whether did your father, Ischomachus <lb/>
            keep possession of all the farms that he thus improved, or did <lb/>
            he sell them, if he could get a good price for them ?' ' He <lb/>
            sold them, I must tell you,' replied Ischomachus; 'but he im­ <lb/>
            mediately bought other land instead of them, and uncultivated <lb/>
            too, on account of his fondness for labour.' 27. ' You say, <lb/>
            then, Ischomachus,' returned I, ‛ that your father was by na­ <lb/>
            ture really not less fond of cultivating the ground than corn­ <lb/>
            merchants are of getting corn; for these traders, from their <lb/>
            strong desire of obtaining grain, sail in quest of it wherever <lb/>
            they hear that it is most abundant, crossing over the Ægean, <lb/>
            Euxine, and Sicilian Seas; and when they have got as much <lb/>
            as they can, they bring it away over the water, stowing it in <lb/>
            the vessel in which they themselves sail. 28. And when they <lb/>
            are in want of money, they do not dispose of their freight at <lb/>
            hazard, or wherever they may happen to be; but wherever <lb/>
            they hear that corn will fetch the highest price, and that men <lb/>
            set the greatest store by it, they carry it thither and offer it <lb/>
            them for sale. In a similar way your father seems to have <lb/>
            been eminently fond of agriculture.' To this Ischomachus <lb/>
            replied, ' You are jesting, Socrates ; but I, nevertheless, con­ <lb/>
            sider those to be fond of architecture who build houses and <lb/>
            sell them, and then build others.' ‛ I indeed swear to you <lb/>
            by Jupiter,' replied I, 'that I believe you, and think1 that <lb/>
            all men naturally love those things from which they suppose <lb/>
            that they will get profit.' <note type="footnote"> 1 'II <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴη</foreign> v <foreign xml:lang="grc">πιστεύειν σοι φύσει νομξειν, κ</foreign>. T. <foreign xml:lang="grc">λ</foreign>.] Before <foreign xml:lang="grc">φύσει</foreign> we <lb/>

            is fond of corn, namely, because he gets profit by it; and he now con­ <lb/>

          <p>Socrates expresses his satisfaction at the information which Ischomachus <lb/>
            had given him. Ischomachus observes that the art of ruling and direct­ <lb/>
            ing others, which is of the utmost importance in agriculture, as well as in <lb/>
            other great undertakings, is difficult of attainment. It cannot be wholly <lb/>
            learned from others, or attained thoroughly, unless there be great natural <lb/>
            ability, power of self-control, and something of divine magnanimity.</p>
          <p>1. " ‛I AM thinking, Ischomachus,' continued I, ‛ how ad­ <lb/>
            mirably you have adapted your whole train of argument tc <lb/>
            support your proposition ; for you laid it down as a fact that <lb/>
            the art of agriculture was the most easy to be learned of all <lb/>
            arts ; and I am now convinced, from everything that you <lb/>
            have said, that such is indisputably the case.' 2. ‛Very <lb/>
            well,' said Ischomachus, ‛ but as to that which is common to <lb/>
            all pursuits, whether agricultural, or political, or domestic, or <lb/>
            military, namely, that he who would excel in them must be <lb/>
            capable of directing others, I entirely agree with you, So­ <lb/>
            crates,1 that some persons greatly excel others in judgment; <lb/>
            3. as we see in a galley,' continued he, ‛ when the crew are <lb/>
            out at sea, and have to accomplish a certain distance in the <lb/>
            course of the day, some of the celeustæ2 can act and speak in <lb/>
            such a manner as to excite the spirits of the men to voluntary <lb/>
            exertion, while others are so dull that the rowers take more <lb/>
            than double the time in performing the same course. The <lb/>
            one party, as well the celeustes as those who are directed by <lb/>
            him, go on shore covered with perspiration, and praising one <lb/>
            another, while the other party arrive indeed unfatigued, but <lb/>
            detesting their officer, and detested by him. 4. So among ge­ <lb/>
            nerals,' added he, ‛ one differs from another in the same <lb/>
            way ; for some bring out troops that are unwilling to expose <lb/>
            themselves either to toil or to danger, thinking it of no im­ <lb/>
            portance, and testifying no readiness, to obey their com­ <lb/>

            produce soldiers that, whatever disgrace happens to them, are <lb/>
            incapable of feeling the least shame at it. 5. But noble, ex­ <lb/>
            cellent, and skilful commanders will render these very same <lb/>
            troops, and often others which they unite with them, ashamed <lb/>
            to do anything dishonourable, and convinced that it is better <lb/>
            to obey orders ; taking delight individually in showing obedi­ <lb/>
            ence, and exerting themselves collectively, without the least <lb/>
            reluctance, whenever exertion is requisite. 6. As there ap­ <lb/>
            pears in certain private individuals, indeed, a liking for la­ <lb/>
            bour, so there is produced in a whole army, by the influence <lb/>
            of good officers, a love of exertion, and an ambition of being <lb/>
            seen by their commander while they are executing any lion­ <lb/>
            ourable achievement. 7. And commanders, towards whom <lb/>
            those who follow them are thus affected, become emi­ <lb/>
            nently powerful; and these, assuredly, are not such as keep <lb/>
            their own bodies in better condition than those of their men, <lb/>
            or hurl javelins or use the bow best, or have the best horses, <lb/>
            or even offer themselves to danger before others as the best <lb/>
            horsemen or targeteers, but such as can inspire their troops <lb/>
            with the conviction that they must follow them even through <lb/>
            fire or any peril whatever. 8. Such commanders, whom num­ <lb/>
            bers follow with such sentiments, we may justly call men of <lb/>
            powerful minds; the general may be truly said to march <lb/>
            with a strong arm, whose will so many arms are willing to <lb/>
            obey; and he is in reality a great man who is able to execute <lb/>
            great things rather by strength of mind than by strength of <lb/>
            body. 9. So in private occupations, whether it be a bailiff or <lb/>
            a foreman1 that gives directions, he that can render those <lb/>
            under him zealous, energetic, and diligent at their work, is <lb/>
            the man that directs their efforts to advantage, and produces <lb/>
            abundance of profit. 10. And if, when the master, who has <lb/>
            the power to punish the idle and to reward the industrious <lb/>
            among his workmen in the highest degree, shows himself in <lb/>
            the field, the men exhibit no extraordinary exertion, I should <lb/>
            certainly feel little esteem for him ; but one at whose appear­ <lb/>
            ance they put themselves in motion, and by whom an increase <note type="footnote"> 1 ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Επίτϱοπος ἐπιστάτης</foreign>.] ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Επίτϱοπος</foreign>, says Sturz in his Lexicon, <lb/>

            tion of one another, and an ambition which has the best effect <lb/>
            on every one, I should regard as having something of a kingly <lb/>
            character. 11. Such influence is of the greatest importance, <lb/>
            as it seems to me, in every pursuit, when anything is to be <lb/>
            effected by means of a number of men, and in agriculture as <lb/>
            well as in any other occupation. Yet I do not say, assuredly, <lb/>
            that it is possible to acquire such a talent by once seeing it <lb/>
            exercised, or by hearing of it once; but I affirm that he who <lb/>
            would be able to do such duties efficiently has need of in­ <lb/>
            struction, and should be of a happy natural disposition,1 and, <lb/>
            what is of the most importance, should have something of the <lb/>
            divine nature. 12. For this art of ruling over willing subjects <lb/>
            appears to me by no means human merely, but to have in it <lb/>
            a portion of the divinity ; and it is evidently accorded only to <lb/>
            those who are truly accomplished in the duties of wisdom. But <lb/>
            to tyrannize over rebellious subjects, the gods assign, as it <lb/>

            <title type="main">INTRODUCTORY REMARKS ON THE BANQUET.</title>
          </head>
          <p>THE Banquet described -by Xenophon was held at the house of <lb/>
            Callias at Athens, to celebrate the victory of the youth Autolycus, <lb/>
            a favourite of Callias, in the pancratium, in the fourth year of the <lb/>
            eighty-ninth Olympiad, B. C. 424. Xenophon himself was present <lb/>
            at it, as he states at the commencement of the first chapter.</p>
          <p>The speakers in the conversation held at the Banquet are,</p>
          <p>1. Callias, a wealthy Athenian, much given to luxury and licen­ <lb/>
            tiousness. At the time of the Banquet he had just come into pos­ <lb/>
            session of great property on the death of his father Hipponicus. <lb/>
            He commanded the heavy-armed infantry of the Athenians when <lb/>
            Iphicrates defeated the Spartans, B. c. 392. About twenty years <lb/>
            afterwards he was one of the commissioners deputed by the Atheni­ <lb/>
            ans to negotiate a peace with the Lacedæmonians, as related by <lb/>
            Xenophon, Hellen. vi. 3, on which occasion Xenophon attributes <lb/>
            to him a speech of much more sound than sense. Socrates is made <lb/>
            to give him excellent advice in the Banquet, but it had little effect <lb/>
            on him; for he continued to waste his substance in ostentatious <lb/>
            luxury, until he was reduced to absolute want, as appears from <lb/>
            Athenæus, xii. p. 537, and Lysias pro Aristoph. Bon. sect. 50. <lb/>
            In the Protagoras of Plato, the scene of which is also laid at his <lb/>
            house, he is represented in much the same light as in the Banquet <lb/>
            of Xenophon.</p>
          <p>2. Autolycus, a handsome youth, the son of Lycon. A statue <lb/>
            of him by Leochares was placed in the Prytaneum at Athens, as <lb/>
            mentioned by Pliny, H. N. xxxiv. 8, and Pausanias, Att. c. 18, <lb/>
            and Bœot. c. 32.</p>
          <p>3. Lycon, the father of Autolycus. Nothing more is known of <lb/>
            nim.</p><pb n="149"/>
            
          <p>4. Niceratus, a friend of Callias, recently married. He speaks <lb/>
            of himself as being accounted somewhat avaricious, and as having <lb/>
            learned by heart all the poems of Homer. He is supposed to have <lb/>
            been put to death by the Thirty Tyrants.</p>
          <p>5. Socrates.</p>
          <p>6. Antisthenes, a friend and disciple of Socrates, greatly attached <lb/>
            to him. He was the founder of the sect of the Cynics.</p>
          <p>7. Hermogenes, a nephew of Callias, and a man of great honour <lb/>
            and virtue. He had been possessed of property in land, but had <lb/>
            lost it in the wars between the Athenians and Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            and was reduced to poverty. He is highly commended by Socrates <lb/>
            in the Memorabilia, ii. 10.</p>
          <p>8. Critobulus, the son of Crito. He was newly married, but <lb/>
            licentious and extravagant, as appears in the second chapter.</p>
          <p>9. Charm ides, son of Glancon, and cousin to Critias, a young <lb/>
            man of handsome person and great ability, but of excessive diffi­ <lb/>
            dence, which unfitted him for taking any efficient part in public <lb/>
            affairs. Yet he was one of those who were appointed to govern <lb/>
            the Peiræeus under the Thirty Tyrants, and was killed in a <lb/>
            skirmish with Thrasybulus, as related by Xenophon, Hellen. ii. <lb/>
            4. 19.</p>
          <p>10. Philippus, a buffoon, who was not invited, but who re­ <lb/>
            quested, after the feast was begun, to be admitted to entertain the <lb/>
            company.</p>
          <p>11. A man of Syracuse, accompanied by a girl and boy who <lb/>
            played on the flute and the lyre, and another girl who danced <lb/>
            and performed tricks.</p>
          <p>Xenophon does not mention anything said by himself at the <lb/>
            Banquet. He appears to have been about twenty at the time that <lb/>
            a took place. See the Is Biographical Notice" of Xenophon.</p><pb n="150"/>

          <p>Occasion of the Banquet. Socrates and his friends invited to it by Callias. <lb/>
            The company admire the beauty of Autolycus. Philippus, a buffoon, who <lb/>
            requests to be allowed to entertain the company, is admitted.</p>
          <p>1. BUT1 it appears to me that not only what is done by <lb/>
            honourable and virtuous men in the serious transactions of <lb/>
            life is worthy of record, but also what they do in their hours <lb/>
            of amusement; and some occurrences at which I was present, <lb/>
            and from which I form this opinion, I design to relate.</p>
          <p>2. At the great festival of Minerva2 there was a cele­ <lb/>
            bration of equestrian games ; and Callias, the son of Hippo­ <lb/>
            nicus, having a great affection for Autolycus, who was still <lb/>
            quite a boy, took him, after he had gained the victory in the <lb/>
            pancratium, to the spectacle. When the equestrian games <lb/>
            were over, he took Autolycus and his father with him, and <lb/>
            went away to his house at the Peirseeus ; and Niceratus ac­ <lb/>
            companied him. 3. Happening to see, however, Socrates, <lb/>
            Critobulus, Hermogenes, Antisthenes, and Charmides dis­ <lb/>
            coursing together, he desired one of his people to conduct <lb/>
            Autolycus and his friends to his house, while he himself went <lb/>
            up to Socrates and his party, and said, 4. " I have met with you <lb/>
            at a very fortunate time; for I am going to have Autolycus <note type="footnote"> 1 This piece commences very abruptly, and as if it had been attached <lb/>
            to something else. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ην μὲν</foreign> yap <foreign xml:lang="grc">Παναθηναίων τω̃ν μεγάλων ίπποδϱομία</foreign>.] There were <lb/>
            two festivals to Minerva, called Panathenæa,the lesser celebrated every <lb/>
            year, and the greater every fifth year. </note> <pb n="151"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="§ 5-8.]"/> <lb/>
            and his father for my guests, and I think that my enter­ <lb/>
            tainment will appear far more splendid, if the dining-room 1 be <lb/>
            graced with men of refined minds,2 such as yourselves, than <lb/>
            if it be filled with generals, captains of horse, and candidates <lb/>
            for office.”3</p>
          <p>5. Socrates replied, " You are always jesting upon us, and <lb/>
            making light of us, because you have given large sums of <lb/>
            money to Protagoras, and Gorgias, and Prodicus, and many <lb/>
            others, to learn wisdom from them ; while you see that we <lb/>
            are but workers for ourselves in the pursuit of wisdom."</p>
          <p>6. " Hitherto, also," 4 replied Callias, " I used to conceal from <lb/>
            you much that I had to say, which was full of wisdom; but <lb/>
            now, if you will come with me, I will show you that I am a <lb/>
            person deserving of very great consideration."</p>
          <p>7. Those who were with Socrates thanked him first of all, <lb/>
            as was proper, for his invitation, but did not make any pro­ <lb/>
            mise to sup with him. As he showed, however, that he should <lb/>
            be much displeased if they did not go with him, they accom­ <lb/>
            panied him; and soon afterwards his other guests,5 some of <lb/>
            whom had been exercising and perfuming themselves, and <lb/>
            others bathing, began to arrive. 8. Autolycus seated himself6 <lb/>
            next to his father, and the others took their places on the <lb/>
            couches in suitable order.7 <note type="footnote">1‛0 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνδϱὼν</foreign>] The apartment in which the men assembled, as distin­ <lb/>

            fers, as Schneider observes, not to Socrates and those who accompanied <lb/>
            him, but to the other guests of Callias. There were several present, who, <lb/>
            like Xenophon, are not mentioned as having taken any part in the con­ <lb/>

            the other guests ; because, as Weiske remarks, the younger and inferior <lb/>
            of the company at entertainments sat, but the others reclined. In proof <lb/>
            of this he refers to Plutarch's Symposium ; Sueton. Claud. c. 32; Tacit. <lb/>

          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="[CH. 1."/> Whoever then had observed what immediately took place <lb/>
            would have thought that beauty was naturally something <lb/>
            kingly, especially if a person possessed it in conjunction with <lb/>
            bashfulness and modesty, as Autolycus possessed it at that <lb/>
            time; 9. for, in the first place, as a brilliant light, when it <lb/>
            appears in the darkness of the night, attracts the eyes of <lb/>
            every one towards it, so the beauty of Autolycus drew upon <lb/>
            him the gaze of all on that occasion ; and there was no one of <lb/>
            those who looked upon him that did not feel some impression <lb/>
            produced on their feelings by him. Some grew silent, and <lb/>
            others composed themselves into a settled kind of attitude. <lb/>
            10.All, doubtless, who are inspired by any god whatever <lb/>
            appear objects worthy of attention ; but those who are in­ <lb/>
            spired by other divinities are so influenced as to assume a <lb/>
            sterner look, to speak in a tone that impresses with awe, and <lb/>
            to exhibit gestures of greater vehemence; while such as are <lb/>
            excited by the gentler influence of Love assume more of <lb/>
            affection in their looks, sink their voice into greater softness, <lb/>
            and manifest in their gestures greater nobleness of soul; <lb/>
            and as Callias then exhibited such indications under the <lb/>
            influence of love, he was an object of admiration to all who <lb/>
            were initiated in the mysteries of that god.</p>
          <p>it. They were proceeding with their supper in silence, as <lb/>
            if it had been imposed upon them by some superior power, <lb/>
            when Philippus, a jester, knocking at the door, requested him <lb/>
            who answered it to announce who he was, and why he wished <lb/>
            to be entertained there, saying that he had come prepared <lb/>
            with everything necessary for supping at another person's <lb/>
            house; and adding that his servant was in great trouble, as <lb/>
            he had brought nothing, and was without his dinner. 12. <lb/>
            Callias, on hearing this message, said, " It would be unbe­ <lb/>
            coming, my friends, to grudge him the shelter of a roof; let <lb/>
            him therefore enter.*' At the same time he cast his eyes on <lb/>
            Autolycus, to ascertain, as was evident, what he might think <lb/>
            of jesting.1 13. But Philippus, presenting himself in the <note type="footnote"> which they must here be taken, if they are allowed to stand. He would <lb/>

            room where the entertainment was held, said, " That I am a <lb/>
            jester you all know; and I come boldly before you, thinking <lb/>
            that it is more of a jest to come uninvited to a feast than in­ <lb/>
            vited." " Take your place on a couch, then," said Callias; <lb/>
            " for those who are present are full of seriousness, as you see, <lb/>
            and may perhaps be in want of amusement."</p>
          <p>14. As they went on with the entertainment, Philippus pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded without delay to give utterance to something jocular, <lb/>
            that he might fulfil the object for which he was invited to <lb/>
            feasts on all occasions. But as he could not excite even a <lb/>
            smile, he was evidently much troubled ; and a little after he <lb/>
            made a second attempt to say something ludicrous. But as <lb/>
            they did not even then laugh at what he said, he grew silent <lb/>
            in the middle of the entertainment, and sat with his garment <lb/>
            thrown over his head. is. Callias immediately said, " What <lb/>
            is this, Philippus? Has any sudden pain seized you?" <lb/>
            " Yes, by Jupiter, Callias," said he with a groan ; ‟ and a <lb/>
            great pain ; for, as laughter is banished from among men, my <lb/>
            employment is at an end ; since, heretofore, I was invited to <lb/>
            feasts in order that the guests might be amused with laughter <lb/>
            through my means ; but now with what view will any one <lb/>
            invite me ? for I should no more be able to talk seriously than <lb/>
            to make myself immortal; and certainly no one will invite <lb/>
            me in the expectation of being invited in return, since it is <lb/>
            unusual for any entertainment ever to be brought into my <lb/>
            house." As he said this, he wiped his eyes, and evidently <lb/>
            appeared, by his tone of voice, to be weeping. 16. They all <lb/>
            then began to console him, signifying that they were likely to <lb/>
            laugh again, and bade him go on with his meal; while Crito­ <lb/>
            bulus laughed heartily at the commiseration expressed for <lb/>
            him. Philippus, when he heard the laugh, uncovered his <lb/>
            face, and exhorting his soul to take courage, as there would <lb/>
            yet be engagements1 for him, resumed his eating. <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Συμβολαί</foreign>.] In exhorting himself to take courage, he plays on the <lb/>

          <p>A Syracusan, with two girls and a boy, exhibits vai ous feats to entertain <lb/>
            the company. Callias proposes to introduce perfumes ; Socrates dissuades <lb/>
            him, and makes some remarks on the subject. While one of the girls <lb/>
            astonishes the company by her dancing, Socrates observes that the female <lb/>
            mind is susceptible of cultivation. He then discusses with Antisthenes <lb/>
            the question whether virtue can be taught, and enlarges on the advant­ <lb/>
            ages of learning to dance. Buffoonery of Philippus.</p>
          <p>1. WHEN the tables had been removed, and the company <lb/>
            had made their libations and sung the pæan,1 a man of Syra­ <lb/>
            cuse came in to divert them, bringing with him a girl that <lb/>
            played excellently on the flute, and a dancing-girl, one of <lb/>
            those that can perform wonderful feats; he had also an ex­ <lb/>
            tremely handsome boy, that could play on the lyre and dance <lb/>
            with the utmost grace. He was in the practice of showing <lb/>
            these children as wonders, and receiving money for the exhi­ <lb/>
            bition. 2. When the girl had played to them on the flute, and <lb/>
            the boy on his lyre, and both of them appeared to please the <lb/>
            company greatly, Socrates said, " By Jupiter, Callias, you <lb/>
            entertain us excellently; for you have not only given us a <lb/>
            banquet of perfect faultlessness, but you present us with the <lb/>
            highest gratifications for our eyes and our ears." 3. ‟What, <lb/>
            then," said Callias, " if they should bring us also in some <lb/>
            perfumes, that we may be gratified with fragrant odours ?" <lb/>
            " By no means," rejoined Socrates ; " for as one sort of dress <lb/>
            is becoming to a woman, and another to a man, so one kind <lb/>
            of odour is suitable to a man, and another to a woman ; and <lb/>
            certainly no man perfumes himself for the sake of another <lb/>
            man ; but women, especially if they are newly married,2 as the <note type="footnote"> 1 As pœan, though it properly signified a hymn to Apollo, was used in <lb/>
            a general sense for a hymn to any deity, I should consider that the pæan <lb/>
            sung on the present occasion was addressed to Minerva, in honour of <lb/>
            whom the feast of the Panathenæa was celebrated. Weiske. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 As women use perfumes themselves, says Zeune, they may wish to <lb/>
            be regaled with a pleasant perfume from their husbands. Women newly <lb/>
            married appear to have been thought by Socrates to be more nice in this <lb/>
            respect than those who had been married some time. Schneider reads, <lb/>
            with Casaubon and Henry Stephens, <foreign xml:lang="grc">μύϱου μέν τί καὶ πϱοσδέονται</foreign>, in­ <lb/>
            terrogatively, which is equivalent, he observes, to <foreign xml:lang="grc">μύϱου οὺ πϱοσδέονται</foreign> <lb/>
            But this seems hardly to suit the drift of the passage. Dindorf reads <lb/>

            wives of Niceratus and Critobulus here, may like something <lb/>
            of perfume, as they themselves cast a perfume around them ; <lb/>
            while to men the smell of oil from the gymnasia is more <lb/>
            pleasing, if in use with them, than that of perfumes to women, <lb/>
            and, if disused, is more eagerly desired. 4. Every one who <lb/>
            has anointed himself with perfumes, whether a slave or a free <lb/>
            man, casts a scent alike; but the odour of honourable exer­ <lb/>
            cises must be the offspring of much practice and time, if it is <lb/>
            to be sweet and worthy of freeborn men."</p>
          <p>5. Lycon then observed, " Such odours may be for young <lb/>
            men ; but what odour ought we, who no longer frequent the <lb/>
            gymnasia, to exhale?" "That of honour and virtue, as­ <lb/>
            suredly," said Socrates. " And whence can a person get such <lb/>
            a perfume?" " Not, certainly, from the sellers of perfumes," <lb/>
            replied Socrates. " From whence, then?" " Theognis has <lb/>
            said, <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_29_fig5.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              ' From the good you will learn what is good; but if you <lb/>
              associate with the bad, you will lose whatever understanding <lb/>
              is in you.'" "Do you hear that, my son?" asked Lycon. <lb/>
              "Yes, assuredly," said Socrates, "and he profits by such in­ <lb/>
              struction ; for when he wished to become victor in the pan­ <lb/>
              cratium, having consulted with you,1 * * * * again, who­ <lb/>
              ever shall seem to him to be most fit for giving instruction in <lb/>
              these pursuits, he will become his pupil." 6. Here many <lb/>
              spoke ; and one of them said, " Where then will he find a <lb/>
              master for this accomplishment?" 2 Another said, " That it <lb/>
              could not even be taught;" and another, that "if anything <lb/>
              could be learned, this could." 7. Socrates however said, <lb/>
              " Since then this is a matter for controversy, let us put it off <lb/>
              to another time; and let us at present conclude what is before <lb/>
              us; for I see that dancing-girl standing waiting, and some­ <lb/>
              body bringing in hoops for her."</p>
          <p>8. Upon this, the other girl began to play on the flute to <lb/>
            her; and a person who stood by the dancing-girl handed her <lb/>
            hoops to the number of twelve ; and she, taking them, began <note type="footnote"> 1 Some words are lost here. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The attainment of virtue, to which Socrates seems to have alluded in <lb/>
            the words that have fallen out of the text. </note> <pb n="156"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[CH 2."/> <lb/>
            to dance, and, at the same time, threw up the hoops, which <lb/>
            kept whirling round, guessing how high she must throw them, <lb/>
            so as to catch them in time with the music. 9. Socrates ob­ <lb/>
            served, "From many other things, my friends, and from what <lb/>
            this girl is now doing, it is apparent that the talent of women <lb/>
            is not at all inferior to that of men, though they are wanting <lb/>
            in bodily vigour1 and strength ; so that whosoever of you has <lb/>
            a wife, let him teach her with confidence whatever he would <lb/>
            wish to have her know." 10. " How is it, then, my dear So­ <lb/>
            crates," said Antisthenes, " that, if you think thus, you do not <lb/>
            also educate Xanthippe, instead of having a wife the most ill­ <lb/>
            conditioned of all women that are in existence, and, as I be­ <lb/>
            lieve, of all that ever were and ever will be?" "Because," <lb/>
            replied Socrates, " I see that those who wish to be skilled in <lb/>
            horsemanship do not choose the best-tempered horses, but <lb/>
            those of high mettle; for they think that if they can master <lb/>
            such animals, they will easily manage any other horses. So <lb/>
            likewise I, wishing to converse and associate with mankind, <lb/>
            have chosen this wife, well knowing that if I shall be able to <lb/>
            endure her, I shall easily bear the society of all other people." <lb/>
            This remark was thought to have been made by no means <lb/>
            inapplicably.2</p>
          <p>11. Soon afterwards a hoop was brought in, stuck round <lb/>
            with swords standing upright. Into the midst of these swords <lb/>
            the dancing-girl leaped head foremost, and sprang out head <lb/>
            foremost over them, so that the spectators were struck with <lb/>
            terror, lest she should be hurt-; but she continued to perform <lb/>
            these feats with boldness and without injury. 12. Socrates <lb/>
            then called to Antisthenes, and said. " I do not think that <lb/>
            those who witness this exhibition will hereafter be disposed to <lb/>
            deny that courage may be taught, when this person, woman <lb/>
            as she is, throws herself so courageously into the midst of <lb/>
            swords." 13. " Would it not then be an excellent thing for <lb/>
            this Syracusan," replied Antisthenes, "to exhibit his dancing- <lb/>
            girl to the whole city, and announce that he will qualify <note type="footnote">1 All the editions, except the small one of Tauchnitz, have <foreign xml:lang="grc">γνώμηςόέ <lb/>

            exclaimed Philippus, " I should like to see Peisander,1 the <lb/>
            popular orator, learning how to run full butt upon swords, <lb/>
            who now, from being unable even to look upon weapons, de­ <lb/>
            clines to take the field with his fellow-citizens."</p>
          <p>15. The boy then began to dance ; and Socrates remarked, <lb/>
            " See how this boy, naturally beautiful as he is, nevertheless <lb/>
            appears still more beautiful when he puts himself into grace­ <lb/>
            ful attitudes than he appeared when he was at rest." " You <lb/>
            seem to me," rejoined Charmides, " to be inclined to praise <lb/>
            the master who taught him to dance." io. " Such is the case, <lb/>
            indeed," replied Socrates, " for I was thinking even of some­ <lb/>
            thing more; I mean that no part of the body is inactive in <lb/>
            dancing, but that the neck, and the legs, and the hands, are <lb/>
            alike exercised, so that he who would have his body improved <lb/>
            in suppleness should learn to dance ; and I," he continued, <lb/>
            addressing himself to the Syracusan, " would gladly learn the <lb/>
            movements of the dance from you." 17. What profit, then, <lb/>
            will you gain from them ?" asked the Syracusan. "I shall <lb/>
            dance, certainly," replied Socrates. At this reply all the <lb/>
            company laughed. But Socrates, with a very serious coun­ <lb/>
            tenance, said, " Do you laugh at me ? Is it then for this <lb/>
            reason, that I wish, by exercise, to enjoy better health, or to <lb/>
            eat and sleep with greater pleasure, or because I desire such <lb/>
            a kind of exercise, that it may not be with me as with the <lb/>
            runners in the foot-race, who become stout in the legs and <lb/>
            narrow in the shoulders, or as with boxers, who become <lb/>
            broad in the shoulders and thin in the legs, but that, exercis­ <lb/>
            ing my whole body, I may render every part equally strong ? <lb/>
            is. Or do you laugh at this, that I shall be under no necessity of <lb/>
            seeking for a companion in my exercise, or to unrobe myself, <lb/>
            being an old man, before a number of people, but that an <lb/>
            apartment which will hold seven couches 2 will be large <lb/>
            enough for me (as this apartment has now been sufficient for <lb/>
            this boy to heat himself even to perspiration), and that I <note type="footnote"> 1 Philippus doubtless means the factious demagogue who promoted <lb/>

            shall exercise myself under a roof in the winter, or, when <lb/>
            heat in the summer is excessive, in the shade of the trees ? <lb/>
            19. Or do you laugh at this, that, having a belly somewhat <lb/>
            larger than is becoming, I wish to reduce it to a more mode­ <lb/>
            rate size ? Do you not know that Charmides here found mo <lb/>
            dancing one morning lately ? " " Yes, indeed," said Char­ <lb/>
            mides, " and at first I was astonished, and feared that you <lb/>
            were mad ; but when I heard from you something similar <lb/>
            to what you are now saying, I went home, and there—I did <lb/>
            not indeed dance, for I never learned to dance,-but I waved <lb/>
            my arms about,1 for that I knew how to do." 20. " Un­ <lb/>
            doubtedly," observed Philippus, " since you appear to have <lb/>
            legs of equal weight with your shoulders, so that if you should <lb/>
            present yourself to be weighed, the lower parts against the <lb/>
            upper, by the stewards of the market, as people bring loaves <lb/>
            to be weighed,2 you seem likely to escape being fined." <lb/>
            " Call me in, then, my dear Socrates," said Callias, " when <lb/>
            you are going to learn to dance, that I may stand opposite to <lb/>
            you, and learn with you."</p>
          <p>21. " But let the flute-player," said Philippus, " play for <lb/>
            me too, that I may also dance." When he stood up, he pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded to imitate the dancing of the boy and that of the girl. <lb/>
            22. And whereas the company had previously commended the <lb/>
            boy, as appearing still more graceful when he was engaged in <lb/>
            gesticulation, Philippus showed, on the other hand, that <lb/>
            whatever part of his body he moved, his whole body became <lb/>
            still more ridiculous than it naturally was ; and whereas they <lb/>
            had admired the girl, because, by bending herself backward, <lb/>
            she imitated a. wheel, he attempted to imitate a wheel by <lb/>
            bending his body forward in a similar way. And at last, be­ <lb/>
            cause they had praised the boy for exercising his whole body <lb/>
            while he danced, Philippus ordered the flute-player to play a <note type="footnote">1 '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Εχειρονόμουν</foreign>.] <foreign xml:lang="grc">Χειρονομι̃ν</foreign> was to exercise the arms, as the legs <lb/>
            are exercised tn dancing, or as we exercise them in sparring or with the <lb/>
            dumb-bells. See Plato de Legg. viii. 2, where it is used as an equivalent <lb/>
            to -<foreign xml:lang="grc">κιαμαχει̃ν</foreign>, and where Ast has collected a great number of passages <lb/>
            in illustration of the word. Suidas says that <foreign xml:lang="grc">Χειρονομι̃ν</foreign> was sometimes <lb/>

            more lively air, and tossed about his legs, and handsy and <lb/>
            head, and every part of him at the same. time. 13. When he <lb/>
            was tired, he threw himself back on the couch, and said, <lb/>
            " There is now a proof, my friends, that my mode of dancing <lb/>
            affords excellent exercise ; for I am thirsty ; and let the <lb/>
            attendant therefore fill me the large cup." " Certainly," said <lb/>
            Callias, " and let him fill it for us too, since we are thirsty <lb/>
            with laughing at your performance." 14. "I too, my friends, <lb/>
            said Socrates, " shall be very well pleased to drink; for <lb/>
            really wine, by moistening the spirits, 1 lulls cares to rest, as <lb/>
            mandragora puts men to sleep, and wakes up pleasant <lb/>
            thoughts, as oil excites a flame. 15. It seems also to me that <lb/>
            the bodies of men are affected in the same way as things that <lb/>
            grow in the ground ; for they, when the gods make them <lb/>
            drink in too great abundance, are unable to rise, or to let the <lb/>
            breezes pass through among them ; 2 but when they imbibe <lb/>
            just so much moisture as to be refreshed by it, they both grow <lb/>
            very upright, and flourish, and come to bear fruit. 16. So if <lb/>
            we, likewise, pour into ourselves drink in too great quantities, <lb/>
            our bodies and minds will soon become powerless, and we <lb/>
            scarcely shall be able to breathe, much less to articulate any­ <lb/>
            thing ; but if our servants refresh us from time to time with <lb/>
            small cups, as with gentle dew (that I also may speak in the <lb/>
            phraseology of Gorgias),3 then, not being forced to grow <lb/>
            intoxicated with wine, but being aptly persuaded by it, we <lb/>
            shall arrive at more agreeable mirth." 17. These remarks <lb/>
            gave pleasure to all; and Philippus added that it became <lb/>
            cup-bearers to imitate able charioteers, who drive their cha­ <lb/>
            riots round the course still quicker and quicker. The cup- <lb/>

            <title type="sub">CHAPTER III.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Socrates proposes that they should engage in some improving conversation, <lb/>
            rather than spend all their time in attending to music and dancing. Each <lb/>
            of the speakers in the dialogue declares on what accomplishment or pos­ <lb/>
            session he most values himself.</p>
          <p>1. SOON after this, the boy played on his lyre, which was <lb/>
            put in tune with the flute, and sang ; when all the company <lb/>
            applauded, and Charmides also said, " It appears to me. my <lb/>
            friends, that as Socrates said with regard to wine, so likewise <lb/>
            this union of the beauty and voices of these children lulls <lb/>
            anxieties to sleep, and gives rise to feelings of love." 2. So­ <lb/>
            crates then again observed, " These children, my friends, ap­ <lb/>
            pear capable of entertaining us ; but I am quite sure that we <lb/>
            consider ourselves far superior to them ; and would it not <lb/>
            then be unbecoming to us, if, while we associate together, we <lb/>
            should not make even an attempt to entertain one another ? " <lb/>
            Several then exclaimed, " Do you then instruct us, Socrates, <lb/>
            in what kind of discourse we may engage, so as best to effect <lb/>
            that object." 3. "I, then, for my own part," replied Socrates, <lb/>
            " would gladly claim from Callias the performance of his pro­ <lb/>
            mise ; for he said, certainly, that if we would dine with him, <lb/>
            he would give us a sample of his wisdom." " And I assur­ <lb/>
            edly will give you a sample," rejoined Callias, "if you will all <lb/>
            contribute to the conversation whatever valuable knowledge <lb/>
            each of you possesses." " Assuredly, then," said Socrates, <lb/>
            " no one will make any opposition to your terms, or offer any <lb/>
            reason why each of us should not communicate to the com­ <lb/>
            pany the most estimable knowledge that he has." 4. " I will <lb/>
            then tell you," said Callias, " on what account I most value my­ <lb/>
            self; for it is this, that I think myself capable of making men <lb/>
            better." " Whether is it by teaching them some mechanical <lb/>
            art," inquired Antisthenes, " or by instructing them in honour <lb/>
            and virtue?" " Is justice a virtue?" asked Callias. "Cer­ <lb/>
            tainly," replied Antisthenes, " it is most indisputably so ; <lb/>
            since, though valour and knowledge appear to be sometimes <lb/>
            detrimental to the friends as well as to the country, of thuse <lb/>
            who possess them, justice has no participation, in any respect, <pb n="161"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="§ 5-9.] "/>with what is wrong." 5. " After each of you, therefore," re­ <lb/>
            joined Callias, "has communicated whatever valuable matter <lb/>
            he has to produce, I also will without scruple tell you by what <lb/>
            art I effect that which I profess. Do you, then, Niceratus," <lb/>
            continued he, "tell us upon what kind of knowledge you value <lb/>
            yourself." "My father," said Niceratus, "who was anxious <lb/>
            that I should grow up a good man, obliged me to learn by <lb/>
            heart all the poems of Homer ; and I could now repeat off­ <lb/>
            hand the whole Iliad and Odyssey." 6. " But has it escaped <lb/>
            your knowledge," said Antisthenes, "that all the rhapsodists 1 <lb/>
            likewise know these poems ?" " How could it escape my <lb/>
            knowledge," rejoined Niceratus, " when I hear them almost <lb/>
            every day ? " " Do you know any class of men," said Antis­ <lb/>
            thenes, " more foolish than the rhapsodists ?" "Indeed," re­ <lb/>
            plied Niceratus, " it does not appear to me that there is any." <lb/>
            " It is certainly very evident," remarked Socrates, " that they <lb/>
            do not know the sense of what they recite ; but you have <lb/>
            given large sums of money to Stesimbrotus and Anaximan­ <lb/>
            der, and many others, so that nothing of any consequence in <lb/>
            the poems can have escaped you." 7. " And as to you, Critobu­ <lb/>
            lus," said Callias, " upon what do you value yourself most ? " <lb/>
            " On beauty," replied Critobulus. " Will you be able to say, <lb/>
            then," asked Socrates, " that you are able to make us better <lb/>
            by means of your beauty ? " " If I am not," answered Crito­ <lb/>
            bulus, " it is plain that I shall be thought a person of no esti­ <lb/>
            mation." 8. "And you, Antisthenes," said Callias, "on what <lb/>
            do you pride yourself ? " " On my wealth," said he. Her­ <lb/>
            mogenes immediately asked him whether he had much wealth. <lb/>
            He replied, with an oath, that he had not even an obolus. <lb/>
            " You have then much land ? " said Hermogenes. " Perhaps <lb/>
            as much as would be sufficient," replied Antisthenes, " for <lb/>
            Autolycus here to sprinkle himself with dust." 9. "We must <lb/>
            certainly hear what you have to say, then," observed Callias. <lb/>
            " But as for you, Charmides, on what do you value your­ <lb/>
            self ? " " I, on the contrary," replied Charmides, " esteem <note type="footnote">1 Men who went about reciting he poems of Homer. Mere recitation <lb/>
            of the poems of Homer, says Antisthenes, does not improve the rhapsodists <lb/>
            in morality ; and how was it to be expected that it should improve you ? </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Stesimbrotus of Thasos, an interpreter of Homer, is mentioned by <lb/>
            Plato, Ion, init. Anaximander seems to have been also an interpreter of <lb/>
            Homer. The remark of Socrates is ironical with regard to Niceratua </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. in. </note> <note type="footnote"> M </note> <pb n="162"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[CH. 3."/> <lb/>
            myself on account of my poverty." " You then esteem your­ <lb/>
            self, certainly," observed Socrates, " for something very ami­ <lb/>
            able ; for poverty is not at all exposed to envy, excites <lb/>
            not the least contention about it, is preserved without being <lb/>
            guarded, and acquires strength under neglect." 10. " But as <lb/>
            to you yourself, Socrates," said Callias, " on what do you <lb/>
            value yourself ?" Socrates, shaping his face into a look of <lb/>
            the utmost gravity, replied, " On the art of pandering." As <lb/>
            the company laughed at his answer, " You laugh," said he, <lb/>
            " but I well know that I might gain a great quantity of <lb/>
            money if I chose to practise the art." 11. " You, however," <lb/>
            said Lycon, pointing to Philippus, "value yourself on your <lb/>
            power of exciting laughter." " And more justly, I think," <lb/>
            rejoined Philippus, " than Callippides the actor values him­ <lb/>
            self on his power ; a man who plumes himself on being able <lb/>
            to set numbers of his hearers weeping." 12. " You also, then, <lb/>
            Lycon," said Antisthenes, will tell us on what you congratu­ <lb/>
            late yourself." "Do you not all know," replied Lycon, " that <lb/>
            it is on this son of mine ? " " And your son doubtless con­ <lb/>
            gratulates himself," observed some one, "on being victorious <lb/>
            in the games." Autolycus, with a blush, replied, " I certainly <lb/>
            do not, I assure you." 13. As they were all pleased to hear him <lb/>
            speak, and turned their eyes towards him, some one asked <lb/>
            him, " But on what is it, then, Autolycus, that you congratu­ <lb/>
            late. yourself ? " He answered, "Upon having such a father," <lb/>
            and at the same time seated himself by his father's side. <lb/>
            Callias, observing this, said, "Do you not know, Lycon, that <lb/>
            you are the richest of mankind ? " " By Jupiter," replied <lb/>
            Lycon, "I certainly did not know it." "Are you not aware <lb/>
            then," said Callias, " that you would not take the wealth <lb/>
            of the king of Persia in exchange for your son ? " "I am <lb/>
            convicted on my own confession, then," replied Lycon, "of <lb/>
            being, as it seems, the richest of men." 14. And you, Her­ <lb/>
            mogenes," said Niceratus, " on what do you most pride your­ <lb/>
            self ? " " On the merit and power of my friends," replied <lb/>
            Hermogenes, "and on the reflection that, though they are <lb/>
            men of such worth, they have a regard for me." Upon this <lb/>
            they all looked at him, and several of them at the same time <lb/>
            asked him, whether he would point out those friends to them, <lb/>
            He replied that he should feel no reluctance to do so.</p><pb n="163"/>

          </ab>
          <p>Each of the company states why he values himself on the ground which he <lb/>
            has mentioned. Callias prides himself on his power of rendering men <lb/>
            more honest; Niceratus, on his knowledge of Homer ; Critobulus, on his <lb/>
            beauty ; Charmides, on his poverty ; Antisthenes, on his riches ; Hermo­ <lb/>
            genes, on the influence of his friends ; Philippus, on his entertaining qual­ <lb/>
            ities ; the Syracusan, on his ability to attract the attention of the foolish <lb/>
            Socratos, on his art of conciliation.</p>
          <p>■. SOON afterwards Socrates observed, " It will then remain <lb/>
            for each of us to show that what he promised to communicate <lb/>
            to us is of great value." "You shall hear me, then, first," <lb/>
            exclaimed Callias ; " for I, during the time that I hear you <lb/>
            discussing what justice is, am rendering other men, at that <lb/>
            very time, more just." "How, my excellent friend?" in­ <lb/>
            quired Socrates. "By giving them money, to be sure." <lb/>
            2. Antisthenes started up, as determined to refute him, and <lb/>
            asked him, "Whether do men appear to you, Callias, to carry <lb/>
            justice in their minds or in their purses ? " " In their minds," <lb/>
            replied he. " And do you, then, by putting money into their <lb/>
            purses, render their minds more devoted to justice ? " " Un­ <lb/>
            doubtedly." " How ? " " Because, as they know that they <lb/>
            have wherewith to buy the necessaries of life, they will not <lb/>
            expose themselves to danger by committing dishonest actions." <lb/>
            3. " And do they repay you," said Antisthenes, " what they <lb/>
            have received ? " " No, by Jupiter," answered Callias, " as­ <lb/>
            suredly not." " What return, then, do they make you for <lb/>
            your money? Thanks?" " No, indeed," replied the other, <lb/>
            " not even thanks ; and some are still worse disposed towards <lb/>
            me than before they received the money." " It is wonderful," <lb/>
            said Antisthenes, looking at him at the same time as if he <lb/>
            was utterly confuting him, " that you can render men just <lb/>
            towards others, and not towards yourself." 4. "Why should <lb/>
            that be wonderful ?" returned Callias. "Do you not see many <lb/>
            carpenters and builders who make houses for many other <lb/>
            men, but are not able to make them for themselves, but live <lb/>
            in hired dwellings ? Endure, therefore, 0 sophist, to be re­ <lb/>
            futed." 5. Let him endure, indeed," added Socrates, "as <note type="footnote"> M 2 </note> <pb n="164"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[CH. 4."/> <lb/>
            augurs, too, are said to foretell what is to happen to others, but <lb/>
            to be unable to foresee what is coming upon themselves."</p>
          <p>6. This portion of the conversation here came to an end. <lb/>
            Niceratus then said, " You shall hear also from me in what <lb/>
            respects you will be improved if you associate with me. You <lb/>
            know doubtless that Homer, the wisest of poets, has sung of <lb/>
            almost all human things. Whoever of you would wish, there­ <lb/>
            fore, to become skilled in husbandry, or eloquent, or fit to be <lb/>
            a general, or like Achilles, or Ajax, or Nestor, or Ulysses, let <lb/>
            him attend to me; for I know all these things." " Do you <lb/>
            know also how to be a king ?" 1 inquired Antisthenes ; " for <lb/>
            you will recollect that Homer praises Agamemnon as being a <lb/>
            good king and a brave warrior." " And I recollect, also," <lb/>
            rejoined Niceratus, " that he says a charioteer must turn his <lb/>
            chariot close to the goal: <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_29_fig6.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              "But incline. in your well-polished chariot, a little to the left <lb/>
              side of the horses; and urge on the right-hand horse, encou­ <lb/>
              raging him with your voice, while you give him the rein loose <lb/>
              in your hand.' 7. I know something too besides this ; and it <lb/>
              is in your power at once to make trial of it; for Homer some­ <lb/>
              where3 says, that ' the onion is a proper accompaniment to <lb/>
              drink;' and if, therefore, any of the attendants will bring us <lb/>
              an onion, you will immediately enjoy the benefit of it, as you <lb/>
              will drink with greater pleasure." 8. Upon this Charmides <lb/>
              observed, " Niceratus, my friends, desires to go home smelling <lb/>
              of onions, that his wife may believe that no one has even <lb/>
              thought of kissing him." " Nay, by Jupiter," exclaimed So­ <lb/>
              crates, " there is danger that we may bring on us another <lb/>
              ridiculous surmise ; for onions appear to be so much of a sea­ <lb/>
              soning, that they give a zest not only to drink but to meat; <lb/>
              and if we eat onions after supper, we must take care lest <lb/>
              people may say that we came to the house of Callias to in- <note type="footnote"> 1 A jocose, or rather malicious, kind of question ; for both Antisthenes <lb/>
              and Niceratus were living in a free state, hostile to tyrants and kings. <lb/>
              Hence Niceratus makes no reply to the question, but turns off the atten­ <lb/>
              tion of the company to something else. Schneider. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 II. xxiii. 335, </note><note type="footnote">3 11 xi. 629. </note> <pb n="165"/>
              <note type="correspondsTo" n="§9-5.]"/> <lb/>
              dulge in gluttony." 9. " We need by no means fear such a <lb/>
              charge, Socrates," said Callias ; " for to eat onions is proper <lb/>
              for a person going to battle, insomuch that some feed cocks <lb/>
              with garlic before they set them to fight; but we are rather <lb/>
              thinking, perhaps, of kissing somebody than of fighting." 10. <lb/>
              In some such a way this part of the conversation came to <lb/>
              an end.</p>
          <p>Critobulus then said, " I will now tell you, in my turn, <lb/>
            for what reasons I value myself on my beauty." " Tell us, <lb/>
            by all means," said the rest. " If I am not beautiful," pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded he, " as I think I am, you will deservedly be convicted <lb/>
            of being deceivers; for you are constantly swearing, though <lb/>
            no one requires an oath of you, that I am beautiful; and I, <lb/>
            to be sure, believe you, since I regard you as honourable and <lb/>
            good men. 11. If, however, I am in reality beautiful, and you <lb/>
            feel towards me as I feel towards any one who appears to <lb/>
            me to be beautiful, I swear by all the gods that I would <lb/>
            not accept the dominions of the king of Persia on condition <lb/>
            of resigning my beauty; 12. since I now look upon Cleinias I <lb/>
            with greater pleasure than upon all the other beautiful objects <lb/>
            in the world ; and I would choose rather to be blind to every­ <lb/>
            thing else than to Cleinias alone. I am angry with the night <lb/>
            and with sleep, because I cannot see him while they continue; <lb/>
            and I feel the greatest gratitude to the day and the sun, be­ <lb/>
            cause they restore Cleinias to my sight. 13. It is justifiable <lb/>
            also for us who are beautiful to value ourselves highly for this <lb/>
            reason, that while he who is strong must gain the objects of his <lb/>
            desire by labour, he who is brave by confronting danger, he <lb/>
            who is wise by speaking, he who is beautiful may effect <lb/>
            everything that he wishes, even without exerting himself. <lb/>
            14. I, therefore, although conscious that wealth is very agree­ <lb/>
            able to keep in one's possession, would more gladly give all <lb/>
            that I have to Cleinias than receive as much more from any <lb/>
            one else ; and I would more willingly be a slave, if Cleinias <lb/>
            would be my master, than continue free; for I would much <lb/>
            rather work for him than remain idle, and run into danger <lb/>
            for him sooner than live free from danger. 15. So that if you, <lb/>
            Callias, value yourself on being able to make men more hon- <note type="footnote">1 A favourite of Critobulus. He is generally supposed to be the <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[CH. 4."/> <lb/>
            est, I have greater reason than you to value myself on leading <lb/>
            men to every kind of virtue;1 since we beautiful persons, as <lb/>
            we produce a certain inspiration in those who are inclined to <lb/>
            love, render them more generous with regard to money, fonder <lb/>
            of enduring toil and gaining honour in hazardous enterprises, <lb/>
            as well as more modest and self-commanding, since they are <lb/>
            most bashful in regard to what they desire most. 16. The <lb/>
            people who do not choose handsome men for commanders of <lb/>
            their troops are mad. I, certainly, would march even through <lb/>
            fire with Cleinias; and I feel that you would do the same <lb/>
            with me; so that you need no longer be in doubt, Socrates, <lb/>

            beauty to be disparaged even on the ground that it soon <lb/>
            passes its meridian ; for, as a boy is beautiful, so likewise is a <lb/>
            young man, and a full-grown man, and an old man. Of this <lb/>
            we have a proof; for the people choose handsome old men as <lb/>

            that beauty is attendant on every age. is. And if it is pleasant <lb/>
            to obtain what we desire from such as grant it willingly, I <lb/>
            am quite sure that I could at this moment prevail on this boy <lb/>
            and girl to kiss me, even though I were not to speak a word <lb/>
            to them, sooner than you, Socrates, although you were to say <lb/>
            numbers of wise things." 19. " How so ?" rejoined Socrates ; <lb/>
            " do you boast thus in the notion that you are more handsome <lb/>
            than I am ?" " Assuredly," replied Critobulus, " or I should <lb/>
            be the ugliest of all the Silent described in the satyric plays."2 <lb/>
            Socrates bore a great resemblance to these Silent. 20. " Take <lb/>
            care to remember, however," said Socrates, " to have the <lb/>

              21. "Will you never cease thinking of Cleinias ?" retorted So­ <lb/>
              crates. " If I should forbear from naming him," said Critobu­ <lb/>
              lus, " do you suppose that I shall think of him at all the less ? <lb/>
              Do you not know that I have his image in my mind so <lb/>
              distinctly, that, if I were a statuary or a painter, I could form <lb/>
              a resemblance of him not less accurately from that image than <lb/>
              if I were looking upon his person?" 22. Socrates inquired, <lb/>
              " Why then, when you carry with you so exact an image of <lb/>
              him, do you give me so much trouble, and take me about to <lb/>
              places where you will see him ?" " Because, Socrates," <lb/>
              returned Critobulus, " the sight of him may give me real <lb/>
              pleasure ; but the contemplation of his image affords me <lb/>
              no enjoyment, and only excites desire in me." 23. Hermo­ <lb/>
              genes observed, " I do not think it becomes you, Socrates, <lb/>
              to allow Critobulus to be thus overcome with love." "Do <lb/>
              you think, then," said Socrates, " that he has become thus <lb/>
              affected since he has associated with me ? " " If not, when <lb/>
              did the affection commence ?" asked Hermogenes. " Do <lb/>
              you not see," rejoined Socrates, " that the hair on the cheeks <lb/>
              of Critobulus is already spread to his ears, and that that <lb/>
              of Cleinias is now only rising to the back part ?2 Crito­ <lb/>
              bulus was therefore violently enamoured when he used to go <lb/>
              to the same schools with Cleinias. 24. His father, perceiv­ <lb/>
              ing what was the state of things, committed him to my care, <lb/>
              to see if I could in any way be of service to him ; and he is <lb/>
              indeed now much better ; for previously, like people who <lb/>
              look at the Gorgons, he would look on Cleinias as fixedly as <lb/>
              if he were made of stone, and could not stir away from him ; 3 <lb/>

              my friends," continued Socrates, " Critobulus appears to me <lb/>
              (a thing to be mentioned only among ourselves) to have even <lb/>
              given kisses to Cleinias, than which there is no stronger <lb/>
              excitement of love ; for it is insatiable, and affords pleasing <lb/>
              expectations. 26. Perhaps, too, to kiss is thought the more <lb/>
              excusable, as the act of touching one another with our mouths <lb/>
              is expressed by the same term 1 as the cherishing of mutual <lb/>
              affection in the mind. On which account I say that he who <lb/>
              would be able to live chastely must abstain from kissing <lb/>
              handsome persons." 27. "But why in the world, my dear So­ <lb/>
              crates," said Charmides, " do you so frighten away us, your <lb/>
              friends, from beautiful objects, when I have seen you your­ <lb/>
              self, I swear by Apollo, at the time that you and Critobulus <lb/>
              were seeking for some passage in the same book at the gram­ <lb/>
              marian's, holding your head close to the head of Critobulus, <lb/>
              and your uncovered shoulder close to his uncovered shoulder." <lb/>
              28. " Alas !" exclaimed Socrates, "it was from this cause 2 <lb/>
              that, as if I -had been bitten by some venomous animal, I had <lb/>
              a pain in my shoulder for more than five days, and seemed to <lb/>
              feel a kind of irritation in my heart. And now I give you <lb/>
              notice, Critobulus," he added, " in the presence of all these <lb/>
              witnesses, not to touch me until you have as much hair upon <lb/>
              your chin as you have upon your head." Thus they kept up <lb/>
              a conversation jocose and serious by turns.</p>
          <p>29. Callias then said, " It is now your part, Charmides, to <lb/>
            say why you value yourself on your poverty." " It is ac­ <lb/>
            knowledged, then," returned Charmides, "that to feel secure is <lb/>
            better than to be in fear, that to be free is better than to be <lb/>
            a slave, to be courted better than to court, to be trusted by <lb/>
            one's country better than to be distrusted. 30. But I, when <lb/>
            I was a rich man in this city, was afraid, in the first place, <lb/>
            lest somebody should break into my house, seize upon my <lb/>
            money, and do me some personal harm. In the next place, I <lb/>
            had to court the favour of the informers,3 knowing that I was <lb/>
            more likely to suffer some injury from them than to do them <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φιλει̃ν, φιλει̃σθαι</foreign>.

            any , for it was perpetually required of TIle by the govern­ <lb/>
            ment to expend money, and I was not allowed to go any­ <lb/>
            where away from the city.1 31. But now, since I am <lb/>
            deprived of my property beyond the frontiers,2 and have no <lb/>
            profit from my lands within the country, while my household <lb/>
            furniture has been sold, I lay myself down to sleep in peace, <lb/>
            I am not suspected by the government, I am no longer <lb/>
            threatened by informers, but can now threaten others, as I am <lb/>
            at liberty to leave the city or to stay in it at my pleasure ; <lb/>
            and the rich rise from their seats before me, and give me the <lb/>
            way.3 32. I am now like a tyrant, but then I was clearly a <lb/>
            slave ; then I paid tribute to the state, now the state pays <lb/>
            tribute to me by maintaining me.4 When I was rich, too, peo­ <lb/>
            ple reproached me because I associated with Socrates ; but <lb/>
            now, since I am grown poor, nobody pays any further atten­ <lb/>
            tion to the matter. And when I had much, I was always los­ <lb/>
            ing something, either from the requirements of the govern­ <lb/>
            ment or the malice of fortune; but now I lose nothing, for <lb/>
            I have nothing to lose, but am constantly in hopes of getting <lb/>
            something." 33. "Do you then pray," inquired Callias, "that <lb/>
            you may never again become rich ; and, if you have any <lb/>
            dream portending good, do you sacrifice to the gods to avert <lb/>
            it ?" " By Jupiter," replied Charmides, " I do no such <lb/>
            thing, but wait very cheerfully, if I have hopes of getting <lb/>
            anything from any quarter."</p>
          <p>34. " Come, then, Antisthenes," said Socrates, " do yon <lb/>
            tell us how it is that, having so little, you value yourself on <lb/>
            your riches." "Because I think, my friends," said Antis­ <lb/>
            thenes, " that men must be considered rich or poor in regard, <lb/>
            not to their estates, but to their minds. 35. For I see many <lb/>
            private individuals, who, though they have great abundance, <lb/>
            yet think themselves so poor that they will undergo any <lb/>

            more ; I know brothers who have inherited equal shares <lb/>
            of their father's property, and yet, while one of them has <lb/>
            sufficient and more than sufficient for his expenses, the other <lb/>
            is in want of everything. 36. I understand that there are also <lb/>
            sovereigns, who are so greedy of wealth, that they will com­ <lb/>
            mit even more grievous crimes to obtain it than the poorer <lb/>
            sort of mankind ; for some of these, we know, steal through <lb/>
            poverty, or break into houses, or sell men for slaves ; bu: <lb/>
            there are some kings who ruin whole families, kill multitude! <lb/>
            of their fellow-creatures, and even reduce entire communities <lb/>
            to slavery, for the sake of money. 37. On such persons I, for <lb/>
            my part, look with great pity, as labouring under a very <lb/>
            grievous disease ; for they seem to me to be affected in the <lb/>
            same way as a person would be who should eat and drink <lb/>
            vast quantities, 1 and yet should never be satisfied. But I <lb/>
            have so many things, that even I myself can scarcely find <lb/>
            them ; 2 yet I have plenty, both to eat till I am no longer <lb/>
            hungry, to drink till I am no longer thirsty, and to clothe <lb/>
            myself in such a way that I am not at all colder out of doors <lb/>
            than our very rich friend Callias here. 38. During the time <lb/>
            that I stay in the house, the walls are regarded by me as very <lb/>
            warm coats, and the roof as a very thick cloak ; and as for <lb/>
            bed-clothes, I have such a comfortable abundance of them, <lb/>
            that it is a matter of some difficulty to awake me out of my <lb/>
            sleep. If ever my passions require me to seek their gratifi­ <lb/>
            cation, whatever presents itself gives me so much satisfaction, <lb/>
            that those to whom I make advances caress me with the <lb/>
            utmost fondness, merely because no one else is ready to make <lb/>
            application to them. 39. All these things, accordingly, seem <lb/>
            so pleasing to me, that I should never wish to have greater <lb/>
            gratification in pursuing any of them, but rather to have <lb/>
            less ; so much more attractive than is desirable do some of <lb/>
            them appear to me to be. 40. But the most estimable advan­ <lb/>
            tage attendant on my riches I consider to be this, that, if any <note type="footnote"> 1 The common texts have <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολλὰ ἂχων καὶ πολλὰ έσθίων</foreign>. Lange <lb/>
            suggested that we should read <foreign xml:lang="grc">πίνων</foreign> instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἓχων</foreign>, and I have, with <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="§ 41—45.]"/> <lb/>
            one should take from me what I now possess, there is no em­ <lb/>
            ployment that I see so mean that it would not afford me <lb/>
            a sufficient maintenance. 41. For when I wish to regale my­ <lb/>
            self, I do not buy costly dainties out of the market-place (since <lb/>
            they are too dear), but I draw from the resources of my <lb/>
            mind ;1 and much greater addition is made to my enjoyment, <lb/>
            when I wait till I want a thing and then take it, than when <lb/>
            I partake of any expensive gratification ; as when on the pre­ <lb/>
            sent occasion, for instance, I meet with this wine of Thasos,2 <lb/>
            and drink it without being thirsty. 42. It is natural, besides, <lb/>
            that those should be far better principled who look to econo­ <lb/>
            my rather than expensiveness ; for those to whom what is <lb/>
            readiest gives most contentment will be least likely to covet <lb/>
            what belongs to others. 43. It is worthy of consideration, <lb/>
            too, that such sort of riches renders men liberal-minded ; for <lb/>
            our friend Socrates here, from whom I have received this <lb/>
            wealth, did not impart it to me by number or by weight, but <lb/>
            gave me as much as ever I could carry away ; and I, at <lb/>
            present, grudge no man what I have, but exhibit my opulence <lb/>
            to all my friends, and give a share of the wealth in my mind <lb/>
            to any one that is willing to receive it. 44. Leisure also, one <lb/>
            of the most delightful of enjoyments, is, you see, always at my <lb/>
            command, so that I can go to see what is worthy to be seen, <lb/>
            can hear what deserves to be heard, and, what I value most <lb/>
            of all, can pass whole days undisturbed with Socrates, who <lb/>
            does not look with admiration on those who can count vast <lb/>
            sums of gold, but makes it the business of his life to converse <lb/>
            with those whose society can give him pleasure."</p>
          <p>45. Thus spoke Antisthenes ; and Callias said to him, " By <lb/>
            Juno, I envy you for your wealth, not only on other accounts, <lb/>
            but because the state does not treat you as its slave, by <lb/>
            imposing duties upon you, and because people have no ill <lb/>
            feeling against you if you do not lend them money." "Do <lb/>
            not envy him, in the name of Jupiter," said Niceratus, "for I <lb/>
            am going to borrow of him the privilege of wanting nothing ; <note type="footnote"> I '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Εκ τη̃ς ψυχη̃ς ταμιεύομαι</foreign>.] I endeavour, by cherishing temper­ <lb/>

              ple to be too covetous of money." At this they all laughed, <lb/>
              thinking that he had spoken what was true.</p>
          <p>46. Some one then said, " It is now your business, Hermo­ <lb/>

            and show that they are persons of great power, and have <lb/>
            a regard for you, that you may be thought justly to value <lb/>
            yourself upon them." 47. " It is then evident," said Hermo­ <lb/>
            genes, " that both Greeks and barbarians consider that the <lb/>

            they are able to do us good or harm ; at least all men entreat <lb/>
            the gods to avert from them what is evil, and to grant them <lb/>
            what is good. 48. But these gods, who know everything, <lb/>
            and can do everything, are so much my friends, that, from the <lb/>
            attention which they pay me, it is never unknown to them, <lb/>
            either by night or by day, whither I am going or what I in­ <lb/>
            tend to do. And as they foreknow what will be the result of <lb/>
            every individual action, they intimate to me, by sending, as <lb/>
            messengers, omens, or dreams, or auguries, what course of <lb/>
            conduct I should pursue, or what course I should avoid; and <lb/>
            when I obey them, I never have cause to repent, but for dis­ <lb/>
            obedience to them I have already, on more occasions than <lb/>
            one, suffered punishment." 49. " Nothing in all this is <lb/>
            incredible," said Socrates ; " but I would gladly learn how it <lb/>
            is that you worship them to make them so much your friends." <lb/>
            " It is done at very little cost, certainly," replied Hermo­ <lb/>
            genes, " for I praise them without putting myself to any ex­ <lb/>
            pense ; I am always ready to give them, in return, a portion <lb/>
            of what they have given me;1 I speak reverentially of <note type="footnote"> Hermogenes means soundness of mind, piety and gratitude towards </note> <pb n="173"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="§ 50—55.]"/> <lb/>
            them, as far as I can, on all occasions ; and in whatever <lb/>
            transactions I call them to witness, I never willingly depart <lb/>
            from truth." " Assuredly, then," said Socrates, " if it is by <lb/>
            such conduct that you make the gods your friends, they take <lb/>
            delight, as is apparent, in honour and virtue." so. This part <lb/>
            of the conversation was thus seriously brought to a close.</p>
          <p>But when they came to Philippus, they asked him what he <lb/>
            saw in buffoonery that he prided himself so much upon it. <lb/>
            " Is it not with good reason," replied he, " when all people, <lb/>
            whenever they meet with any good fortune, invite me, know­ <lb/>
            in., that I am a buffoon, to enjoy it with them ; but when they <lb/>
            incur any ill fortune, run away from me without looking <lb/>
            back, fearing that I may make them laugh in spite of them­ <lb/>
            selves?" 51. By Jupiter," exclaimed Niceratus, "you do <lb/>
            indeed justly value yourself on your profession ; for as for <lb/>
            me, on the contrary, such of my friends as are in prosperity <lb/>
            flee from the sight of me, but such as fall into misfortune <lb/>
            count their degrees of relationship to me, and never let me <lb/>
            alone."</p>
          <p>52. " Perhaps such may be the case," said Charmides ; <lb/>
            " but as for you, Syracusan, on what do you value yourself ? <lb/>
            Doubtless it is upon your boy." " No, by Jupiter," replied <lb/>
            he, " not at all, since I am ever in the greatest fear about him ; <lb/>
            for I see that certain people are plotting how to work his <lb/>
            ruin." 53. Socrates, hearing this, said, " In what respect dc <lb/>
            they think they have been so much injured by your boy as to <lb/>
            wish to destroy him ? " " They do not indeed wish entirely <lb/>
            to destroy him," said the Syracusan, " but to induce him <lb/>
            to sleep with them." " You think, then, as you seem to <lb/>
            indicate, that he would be ruined if this should take place.." <lb/>
            " Undoubtedly, by Jupiter," replied the Syracusan. 54. "Do <lb/>
            not you yourself, then," asked Socrates, " sleep with him ? " <lb/>
            " Certainly," replied he, " all night and every night." " By <lb/>
            Juno, then," exclaimed Socrates, "it is a great good fortune <lb/>
            to you to have been born with such a skin that you alone do <lb/>
            not ruin those who sleep with you ; so that you may very rea <lb/>
            sonably value yourself, if upon nothing else, at least upon youi <lb/>
            skin." 55. " Yet assuredly," said the Syracusan, " I do no­ <note type="footnote">the gods, which he is pleased to feel through their goodness, and of which. <lb/>
            by his prayers, praise, and thankfulness, he offers them as it were a re­ <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[CH. 4."/><lb/>
            value myself upon it." "Upon what, then?" asked Socrates. <lb/>
            " Upon finding fools, by Jupiter," returned he; " for it is <lb/>
            they that by looking at my puppets find me maintenance." <lb/>
            "It was then for this reason, said Pfiilippus, "that I lately <lb/>
            heard you praying the gods to give, wherever you might be, <lb/>
            abundance of food and scarcity of understanding."</p>
          <p>56. " Well," said Callias, " but what have you to say, So­ <lb/>
            crates, to convince us that it is justifiable in you to value <lb/>
            yourself on the art of which you just now spoke, and which <lb/>
            is accounted so dishonourable ? " I Socrates replied, " Let us <lb/>
            first settle between us what the business of a procurer is ; and <lb/>
            whatever questions I ask, do not refuse to answer, that we <lb/>
            may know what it is that we settle. Does this meet with your <lb/>
            approval ? " " Assuredly," said they; and when they had <lb/>
            once said "Assuredly," they all continued afterwards to <lb/>
            answer in the same way. 57. " Does it then appear to you to be <lb/>
            the business of a good procurer," said he, "to render him or <lb/>
            her, whom he gets into his hands, pleasing to those with whom <lb/>
            he or she is to associate ? " Assuredly," said they. " Does <lb/>
            not one means of pleasing, then, consist in having a graceful <lb/>
            arrangement of the hair and dress ? " " Assuredly," said they. <lb/>
            58. " Are we not aware, too, that it is possible for a person to <lb/>
            look upon others kindly or unkindly with the same eyes ?" <lb/>
            " Assuredly." " Is it not possible also to speak modestly or boldly <lb/>
            with the same voice ? " " Assuredly." "Are there not likewise <lb/>
            some modes of address that provoke dislike, and others that <lb/>
            conciliate regard?" "Assuredly." 59. "Of these, then, a <lb/>
            good procurer would teach those which have a tendency to <lb/>
            please ?" " Assuredly." " And which of the two would be <lb/>
            better in his profession, he who should render those under his <lb/>
            care able to please one only, or he who should make them <lb/>
            capable of pleasing many ? " Here, however, the company <lb/>
            differed in their mode of replying, and some said, " It is plain <lb/>
            that he is the better who can teach how to please most," while <lb/>
            the rest answered, " Assuredly." 60. Socrates, observing <lb/>
            that they were then agreed however on this point, proceeded to <lb/>
            say, " And if any one could qualify people to please the whole <lb/>
            state, would he not at once be considered an extremely excel­ <lb/>
            lent conciliator ? " " Indisputably," said they all. "If any one <lb/>
            therefore can form those whom he takes under his care into <lb/>
            such characters, he may justly value himself on his art, and <note type="footnote">1 See c. 3, sect 10. </note> <pb n="175"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="§ 61-64.]"/> <lb/>
            justly receive large sums for his instruction ?" 61. As they all <lb/>
            agreed to this, "Then," said Socrates, " our friend Antisthenes <lb/>
            here appears to me to be a conciliator of that kind." " What!" <lb/>
            exclaimed Antisthenes, " do you attribute this art to TIle, <lb/>
            Socrates ? " " Yes, undoubtedly," replied Socrates ; " for I <lb/>
            see you practising with great diligence the art which is coil­ <lb/>
            stantly attendant on it." " What art is that ?" inquired An­ <lb/>
            tisthenes. " The art of seduction," replied. Socrates.' 62. An­ <lb/>
            tisthenes was then seriously displeased, and said, " What are <lb/>
            you aware that I have committed of this kind, Socrates ?" <lb/>
            " I am aware," replied Socrates, " that you seduced our friend <lb/>
            Callias here to visit the wise Prodicus, because you saw that <lb/>
            the one was in love with philosophy, and that the other was <lb/>
            in want of money; I am aware that you seduced him, too, to <lb/>
            go to Hippias of Elis, from whom he learned the art of <lb/>
            memory, in consequence of which he has grown still more <lb/>
            amorous than before, because, whatever beautiful object he <lb/>
            sees, he never forgets it. 63. Lately, also, after recommend­ <lb/>
            ing a stranger from Heracleia1 in my hearing, and making <lb/>
            me desirous of seeing him, you presented him to me ; and I <lb/>
            am thankful to you for having done so, for he seems to me to <lb/>
            be a man of honour and virtue. Did you not likewise, by <lb/>
            praising Æschylus of Phlius to me, and me to him, affect us <lb/>
            both in such a manner, through what you said, that we ran <lb/>
            about like dogs seeking for one another ? 64. Seeing, then, <lb/>
            that you are able to do such things, I consider you to be an <lb/>
            excellent conciliator; for he who is able to distinguish such <lb/>
            as are useful to themselves, and can render them desirous of <lb/>
            the company of one another, appears to me capable of placing <lb/>
            whole communities on friendly terms, of promoting suitable <lb/>
            marriages, and of becoming a person of great consequence to be <lb/>
            gained both by states and private friends and allies ? Yet <lb/>
            you were angry, as if you had been calumniated, because I <lb/>
            said that you were a skilful conciliator." " However, I am <lb/>
            not so now, assuredly," replied Antisthenes ; " for if I can do <lb/>
            such things, I shall have my mind fully stored with richest 2 <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>A discussion between Critobulus and Socrates on the comparative beauty of <lb/>
            their persons. Socrates enlarges on the attractions of his features, but, <lb/>
            being pronounced less handsome than Critobulus, complains that the <lb/>
            judges had been bribed to give sentence against him.</p>
          <p>1. CALLIAS then said, "But are not you, Critobulus, going <lb/>
            to enter the lists with Socrates on the question of beauty ? " <lb/>
            " Possibly not," said Socrates, " for perhaps he sees that the <lb/>
            conciliator is in some favour with the judges." 2 2. " Never­ <lb/>
            theless," rejoined Critobulus, " I do not shrink from the con­ <lb/>
            test ; prove, therefore, if you have any efficient argument, <lb/>
            that you are more beautiful than I am ; only," added he, " let <lb/>
            the attendant bring the lamp close to us."3 "I challenge <lb/>
            you, then, first," said Socrates, " to an examination of the <lb/>
            question ; and do you reply to my interrogatories." " Question <lb/>
            me, then," said Critobulus. 3. " Whether, therefore," asked <lb/>
            Socrates, " do you think that beauty exists in man only, or in <lb/>
            any other object likewise?" "I certainly think," replied <lb/>
            Critobulus, " that it exists also in horses, and oxen, and in <lb/>
            many inanimate objects. I know at least that there are <lb/>
            beautiful shields, and swords, and spears." 4. " And how is <lb/>
            it possible," said Socrates, " that these objects, which are not <lb/>
            all similar one to another, should be all beautiful ? " " If <lb/>
            they be well formed for the purposes for which we respectively <lb/>
            employ them," said Critobulus, "or well adapted by nature <lb/>
            for that for which we want them, they will also assuredly be <lb/>
            beautiful."4 5. " Do you know, then," said Socrates, " for <lb/>
            what purpose we want eyes ? " " Plainly," returned Critobu­ <lb/>
            lus, " for the purpose of seeing." " Then in that case my <lb/>
            3yes will be more beautiful than yours." " How, I pray ? " <lb/>
            ' Because yours see only what is straight before you, but mine <lb/>
            see also what is on each side of them, from being prominent ?" <lb/>
            ' You say, then," rejoined Critobulus, " that the crab has the <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τὸν μαστροπόν</foreign>, literally the procurer or pander.

            best eyes of all animals ?" I " Undoubtedly," replied Socrates, <lb/>
            since it has them also excellently adapted for security."2 <lb/>
            6. " Be it so," said Critobulus ; " but which of our noses is the <lb/>
            more beautiful, yours or minine "I certainly think that <lb/>
            mine is the more beautiful," replied Socrates, " if the gods <lb/>
            made noses for the purpose of smelling; for your nostrils look <lb/>
            to the ground, but mine are expanded upwards, so as to catch <lb/>
            scents from all quarters?" "But how can a flat nose be <lb/>
            more beautiful than a straight one?" "Because," answered <lb/>
            Socrates, " it is no obstruction to the eyes; but allows them <lb/>
            to see whatever they wish; but a high nose, as if it designed <lb/>
            to do harm, parts the eyes by a kind of obstructing wall." <lb/>
            7. " As to the mouth," continued Critobulus, " I yield you thE <lb/>
            superiority; for if a mouth be made for the purpose of biting, <lb/>
            you would bite off much larger pieces from anything than I ; <lb/>
            and, as you have thick lips, do you not think that your kiss is <lb/>
            softer than mine?" " I seem," returned Socrates, " accord­ <lb/>
            ing to your description, to have a mouth even more ugly than <lb/>
            that of an ass. But do you not think this a proof that I <lb/>
            am more beautiful than you, namely, that the Naiads, who are <lb/>
            goddesses, are the mothers of the Sileni,3 who resemble me <lb/>
            far more than you?" 8. To this Critobulus replied, "I am <lb/>
            no'longer able to maintain the contest with you, Socrates; <lb/>
            let them therefore distribute the pebbles for voting, that I <lb/>
            may know at once what penalty I must suffer or pay.4 <lb/>
            Only," added be, "let them give their votes secretly, for I <lb/>
            fear lest that wealth of yours, and that of Antisthenes,5 should <lb/>
            be too strong for me." 9. The girl and boy, accordingly, <lb/>
            distributed the pebbles secretly. Socrates, at the same time, <lb/>
            desired the attendant to bring the lamp opposite Critobulus, <lb/>
            that the judges might not be deceived, and requested that the <lb/>
            distinctions assigned by the judges might not be chaplets, but <lb/>
            kisses.6. 10.

            and were all in favour of Critobulus, "Ah!" exclaimed <lb/>
            Socrates, " your wealth, Critobulus, does not seem to be like <lb/>
            that of Callias; for his makes people more honest, but yours, like <lb/>
            wealth in general, is capable of corrupting both umpires and <lb/>

          <p>Socrates engages in a discussion with Hermogenes. The Syracusan speaks <lb/>
            impertinently to Socrates, and is repressed by him and Antisthenes.</p>
          <p>1. IMMEDIATELY afterwards, some desired Critobulus to <lb/>
            claim the prizes of his victory, kisses; others bade him ob­ <lb/>
            tain the consent of the master,1 others jested in other ways. <lb/>
            Hermogenes, however, then also continued silent.2 But <lb/>
            Socrates, addressing him by name, said, " Could you tell us, <lb/>
            Hermogenes, what <foreign xml:lang="grc">παροινία</foreign> is ? ” “ If you ask what it is <lb/>
            absolutely," replied Hermogenes, “ I must say that I do not <lb/>
            know ; but I will tell you what it appears to me to be." 2. <lb/>
            " That will satisfy me," said Socrates. " I consider than," <lb/>
            said Hermogenes, " that to cause annoyance over your wine to <lb/>
            those with whom you associate, is <foreign xml:lang="grc">παροινία</foreign>.” " Do you know, <lb/>
            then, that you now cause us annoyance by continuing silent?" <lb/>
            “ Even while you are speaking ?" asked Hermogenes. "No," <lb/>
            replied Socrates, "but when we come to a pause in speaking." <lb/>
            “ Are you not aware, then," rejoined Hermogenes, “ that a <lb/>
            person could not insert even a hair, much less a speech, be­ <lb/>
            tween the portions of your conversation ?" 3. Socrates then <lb/>
            said, " Can you, Callias, give any support to a man who has <lb/>
            the worst of the argument?”3 "I can," returned Callias, <note type="footnote"> girl who were collecting the votes; but this supposition is surely inad­ <lb/>

            " for when the flute begins to play, we shall be all silenced <lb/>
            together." " Would you consent, then,” said Hermogenes, <lb/>
            “ that as Nicostratus the actor used to recite tetrameter <lb/>
            :ambies to the sound of the flute, so I, likewise, should converse <lb/>
            with you to the sound of the flute ? " 4. “ Do so, in the name <lb/>
            of the gods," said Socrates ; “ for as a song is sweeter when <lb/>
            sung to the flute, so I suppose that your words will receive <lb/>
            something more of sweetness from the musical notes, especi­ <lb/>
            ally if you unite gesture to your speech, as the girl that <lb/>
            plays on the flute does." 5. Callias then asked, " When Antis­ <lb/>
            thenes, therefore, defeats any one of the company in argu­ <lb/>
            ment, what sort of music shall be played ?" "I think that <lb/>
            the music best adapted to the person defeated," replied Antis­ <lb/>
            thenes, " must be of a hissing character." 1</p>
          <p>6. While such conversation was going on, the Syracusan, <lb/>
            observing that the company paid no attention to his exhibition, <lb/>
            but were entertaining one another, felt displeased with So­ <lb/>
            crates, and said to him, “ Is it you, Socrates, that are called <lb/>
            the contemplator?” 2 " It is certainly better to be called so," re­ <lb/>
            plied Socrates, "than to be called incapable of contempla­ <lb/>
            tion." "Yes, if you were not thought to be a contemplator <lb/>
            of sublimities ?" 7. "Do you know anything, then," asked So­ <lb/>
            crates, " more sublime than the gods ?” " But, by Jupiter," <lb/>
            returned the Syracusan, " people say that you do not attend <lb/>
            to such subjects, but to things utterly above our concern." <lb/>
            “ Even so," continued Socrates, " I should attend to the gods; <lb/>
            for they, being above us, send us blessings from above, and <lb/>
            supply us with light from above.3 If I make poor puns, you <lb/>
            are to blame for troubling me with your questions." 8. <lb/>
            “ Say nothing more of this, then," rejoined the Syracusan, <lb/>
            but tell me how many skips of a flea4 you are distant from <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Συριγμόν</foreign>.] Socrates plays on the ambiguity of the word, which <lb/>

            thenes here interrupted him by saying, " You, Philippus, are <lb/>
            acute at making comparisons;1 does not this man appear to you <lb/>
            to be very like a person desirous to offer an insult?" " Yes, by <lb/>
            Jupiter," replied Philippus, " and he appears so to many other <lb/>
            people." 9. " Nevertheless," said Socrates, " do not compare <lb/>
            him to anything, lest you yourself should appear like a person <lb/>
            offering an insult." "But if I should compare him to every­ <lb/>
            thing that is good and excellent, any one might then, surely, <lb/>
            with justice compare me to a person bestowing praise, rather <lb/>
            than offering an insult." " No ; for even now you resemble <lb/>
            a person offering an insult, if you say that everything in him <lb/>
            is excellent."2 " Would you wish me, then, to compare him <lb/>
            to what is of an inferior character ? " " No ; nor to anything <lb/>
            that is of an inferior character." " To nothing at all, then ?” <lb/>
            "Compare him to nothing at all."3 "But, if I am silent, I <lb/>
            do not know how I shall acquit myself as becomes the enter­ <lb/>
            tainment." “ Very easily," rejoined Socrates, "if you are <lb/>
            silent in regard to what you ought not to say." Thus termi­ <lb/>
            nated this affray over the wine.</p>

          <p>Socrates recommends the Syracusan to exhibit some more rational enter­ <lb/>

          <p>i. AFTER this, some of the others encouraged Philippus to <lb/>
            proceed with his comparisons; but some dissuaded him. As <lb/>
            a noise arose, Socrates again began to speak, and observed, <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δεινὸς</foreign>—<foreign xml:lang="grc">εὶκάζειν</foreign>. ] Philippus, as a buffoon, ridiculed people by <lb/>

            “ Since we are all now eager to speak, might we not all very <lb/>
            well sing together ?” As he uttered these words, he began <lb/>
            himself to sing. 2. When he had ended his song, there <lb/>
            was brought in a wheel, such as potters use, for the dancing <lb/>
            girl, on which she was to perform surprising feats." Socrates <lb/>
            then said, " I shall now be in danger of being in reality, as <lb/>
            you say that I am, a contemplator; for I am considering how <lb/>
            this boy and girl of yours may most conveniently perform, <lb/>
            and how we may have most satisfaction in looking at them, <lb/>
            as I know that you also desire. 3. It seems to me, then, that to <lb/>
            leap head foremost among the swords is a performance of <lb/>
            danger not at all suited to an entertainment of this kind ; and <lb/>
            to write and read upon the hoop while it is twirling round is <lb/>
            perhaps a wonderful exhibition, but I do not know what plea­ <lb/>
            sure even that can afford. Nor is it at all more agreeable <lb/>
            to see beautiful and elegant persons distorting their bodies, <lb/>
            and imitating hoops, than remaining at rest. 4. Nor is it at <lb/>
            all rare to meet with surprising phenomena, if a person wishes <lb/>
            to do so ; for we may well wonder at things immediately be­ <lb/>
            fore us, as for example, why that lamp, from having a bright <lb/>
            flame, affords us light, while the brazen part of it,1 though <lb/>
            extremely bright, gives no light, and yet at the same time <lb/>
            reflects in it other visible objects ; and how oil, which is liquid, <lb/>
            increases that flame, while water, merely because it is a liquid, <lb/>
            puts out fire. But such questions have not the same tendency <lb/>
            as wine.2 5. However, if the boy and girl should dance to <lb/>
            the flute in the manner in which the Graces, and Hours, and <lb/>
            Nymphs are painted, I think that they would perform their <lb/>
            task with much greater pleasure, and that our entertainment <lb/>
            would receive a great increase of attraction." "By Jupiter, <lb/>
            Socrates," exclaimed the Syracusan, "you say well, and I <lb/>
            will introduce some representations with which you will be <lb/>
            pleased." <note type="footnote"> 1 To <foreign xml:lang="grc">δὲ χαλκει̃ον</foreign>. ] Weiske and Zeune thought that a brazen mirror, <lb/>
            placed somewhere in the apartment, was meant. Schneider, with better <lb/>

          <p>Socrates discourses on love, and jocosely complains of the annoyance which <lb/>
            he receives from the constant attendance of Antisthenes. He observes that <lb/>
            there are two kinds of love, and exhorts his hearers, and especially Callias, <lb/>
            to pursue the more honourable kind.</p>
          <p>1. THE Syracusan accordingly went out and began to pre­ <lb/>
            pare himself;1 while Socrates again entered on a new subject <lb/>
            of conversation. “ Is it right," said he, " my friends, when a <lb/>
            great deity is present among us, one who is equal in age to <lb/>
            the gods that have always existed, who is extremely youthful <lb/>
            in form, who embraces everything in the extent of his power, <lb/>
            and yet lets himself down to an equality with the soul of man, <lb/>
            I mean LOVE, for us to neglect to pay respect to him, especi­ <lb/>
            ally when we are all votaries of that deity? 2. For myself, I can­ <lb/>
            not refer to any period of my life, in which I was not in love <lb/>
            with somebody. As for Charmides here, I know that he has <lb/>
            many in love with him, and that. there are some with whom <lb/>
            he himself has been also in love. Critobulus, certainly, is <lb/>
            both loved and has love for others. 3. Niceratus, too, as I <lb/>
            hear, is in love with his wife, and is loved by her in return. <lb/>
            As to Hermogenes, which of us does not know that he is <lb/>
            pining for love of honour, whatever honour is ? Do you not <lb/>
            see how serious his brow is, how settled his eye, how mild his <lb/>
            words, how gentle his tone, how pleasing his manner ? Yet, <lb/>
            though he enjoys the favour of the most worshipful of the <lb/>
            deities, he does not neglect us men. 4. And do you alone, <lb/>
            Antisthenes, love no one?" "Nay, by all the gods," replied <lb/>
            Antisthenes, “ I love you with all my heart." Socrates, as if <lb/>
            he were somewhat offended, rejoined jestingly, "Give me no <lb/>
            trouble on that subject at present, for, as you see, I am fixing <lb/>
            my attention on something else." 5. " How constantly," ex­ <lb/>
            claimed Antisthenes, “ do you, master of the affections of <lb/>
            others as you are,2 act undisguisedly thus ! for sometimes you <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Συνεκροτει̃το</foreign>. ] Se componebat, instituebat, settled what should be <lb/>

            times, for he knew that he could easily attract them to him again. </note> <pb n="183"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="§ 6 — 13.]"/> <lb/>
            avoid conversing with me, because you pretend to have been <lb/>
            prohibited by your demon, and sometimes because you want <lb/>
            to attend to something else." 6. " In the name of the gods. <lb/>
            Antisthenes," rejoined Socrates, "forbear at least from killing <lb/>
            me ;1 all other trouble from you I bear, and will continue to <lb/>
            bear, with friendly feelings, but let us conceal your love for me, <lb/>
            since it is love, not for my understanding, but for my beauty. <lb/>
            7. That you, Callias," he continued, " love Autolycus, the whole <lb/>
            city knows, and, I suppose, many foreigners. One cause of <lb/>
            this love between you is, that you are both sons of celebrated <lb/>
            fathers, and are yourselves distinguished. 8. I have always <lb/>
            admired your disposition, and I now admire it much more, as <lb/>
            I see that you are in love, not with one who prides himself <lb/>
            on his delicacy, and is corrupted with effeminate pleasure, but <lb/>
            with one who manifests vigour, and endurance, and fortitude, <lb/>
            and temperance. 9. Whether, indeed, there be one Venus or <lb/>
            two,2 a celestial and a vulgar, I do not know (for Jupiter, <lb/>
            who is thought to be but one and the same, has many appella­ <lb/>
            tions), but that there are altars, and temples, and sacrifices, <lb/>
            for each of them separately, the more licentious for the vulgar, <lb/>
            and the more pure for the celestial, I am very well aware. 10. <lb/>
            You may conjecture, too, that the vulgar Venus inspires man­ <lb/>
            kind with the love of the body only, but the celestial Venus <lb/>
            with the love of the soul, of friendship, and of honourable <lb/>
            deeds ; with which love you, my dear Callias, appear tome to be <lb/>
            infl uenced. 11. I conceive this from the honourable and virtuous <lb/>
            character of the object of your love, and from seeing that his <lb/>
            father admits you to intercourse with him; for with one who <lb/>
            entertains a pure and honourable affection, there is nothing in <lb/>
            such matters to conceal from a father.” 12. "By Juno, Socrates," <lb/>
            observed Hermogenes, " I not only admire you on other ac­ <lb/>
            counts, but because you now at once gratify Callias by your <lb/>
            praises, and teach him what he ought to be." " I certainly <lb/>
            mean to do so," rejoined Socrates, “ and that he may be still <lb/>
            more pleased, I wish to testify to him how much better the love <lb/>
            of the mind is than that of the body. 13. For that there is <lb/>
            no society, worthy of any account, without friendship, we all <lb/>
            know ; and to love, in those who admire the dispositions of <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μόνον μὴ συγκόψης με</foreign>.] Ne nimium mihi obtundas, ne conficias <lb/>
            me, examines. Weiske. </note><note type="footnote"> a See Plato, Sympos. c. 8. </note> <pb n="184"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[CH. 8."/> <lb/>
            one another, is called an intimate and spontaneous connexion ; <lb/>
            but of those who lov3 the body, many censure and dislike the <lb/>
            character of those that they love.1 14. But if they found <lb/>
            their love on the two united, the prime of beauty soon passes <lb/>
            off, and when this fails, affection must decay at the same time; <lb/>
            while the mind, as long as it continues to improve in under­ <lb/>
            standing, grows more and more deserving of love. 15. In the <lb/>
            enjoyment of beauty, too, satiety arises ; and consequently, as <lb/>
            we are affected in regard to food, from being satisfied, so we <lb/>
            must likewise be affected, from the same cause, in regard to <lb/>
            objects of corporeal love ; but the love of the mind, from being <lb/>
            pure, is also less liable to satiety, and yet is not on this ac­ <lb/>
            count, as any one might suppose, the less attended with plea­ <lb/>
            sure ; but the prayer in which we entreat the goddess to <lb/>
            grant that what we say and do may be lovely, is plainly ac­ <lb/>
            complished. 16. For that a soul which grows up in a noble <lb/>
            form, and with modest and generous feelings, and which is at <lb/>
            once commanding and benevolent among those of its own age, <lb/>
            admires and loves the object on which it places its affection, <lb/>
            requires no proof; but that it is probable that a lover of such <lb/>
            a character will also be loved in return by the object of his <lb/>
            love, I will demonstrate.</p>
          <p>17. "In the first place, can any person hate another by <lb/>
            whom he is conscious that he is thought fair and good ? Or <lb/>
            him whom he sees2 studying the honour of the object of his <lb/>
            affection more than his own pleasure ? Or as long as he be­ <lb/>
            lieves that even if he should commit any light offence, or grow <lb/>
            less beautiful through sickness, the love between them would <lb/>
            not be lessened ? 18. Must not those who feel mutual affec­ <lb/>
            tion look upon one another with pleasure, converse together <lb/>
            tenderly, give and receive confidence, take thought for the <lb/>
            interests of each other, delight together in honourable actions, <lb/>
            and grieve together if any ill fortune happen to either? <lb/>
            Must they not constantly feel pleasure when they meet to­ <lb/>
            gether in health, and, if either fall sick, must they not expe­ <lb/>
            rience still closer attachment? Must they not be still more <lb/>
            concerned for one another when they are separated than when <note type="footnote"> 1 We must read <foreign xml:lang="grc">τω̃ν ἐρωμένων</foreign>, with Dindorf, not <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸν ἐρώμενον</foreign>, as in <lb/>

            they are together? Are not all such feelings full of love? <lb/>
            It is through such proofs of attachment that they continue <lb/>
            desirous of mutual friendship, and in the enjoyment of it, to <lb/>
            extreme old age. 19. But as for him whose love depends <lb/>
            only on bodily attractions, why should the object of his love <lb/>
            conceive any affection for him in return ? Whether would it <lb/>
            be because he secures for himself what he covets, and brings <lb/>
            utter disgrace on the person that he courts ? Or because he <lb/>
            alienates, in the highest degree, the relatives of the object of <lb/>
            his affections, in consequence of what he desires to obtain <lb/>
            from that object ? 20. Though he does not use violence, but <lb/>
            persuasion, he is but, on that account, the more deserving of <lb/>
            detestation ; for he who offers violence shows at once the bad­ <lb/>
            ness of his character; but he who tries seduction secretly <lb/>
            undermines the principles of the person that he seduces. 21. <lb/>
            As for the person, too, who sells beauty for money, why should <lb/>
            such a person love him who buys it more than a man who <lb/>
            sells and disposes of goods in the market loves his purchasers ? <lb/>
            Assuredly the one will feel no love for the other, merely be­ <lb/>
            cause the one being young associates with the other who is no <lb/>
            longer young,1 or because the one being beautiful associates <lb/>
            with the other who is no longer beautiful, or because the one <lb/>
            being without desire associates with the other who is inflamed <lb/>
            with desire. The youth who consorts with the full-grown <lb/>
            man has not, like a woman, a share in the delights of love, <lb/>
            but is like a sober person who looks upon one who is intoxi­ <lb/>
            cated with pleasure. 22. Hence it is by no means surprising <lb/>
            if contempt for him who courts arises in him who is courted. <lb/>
            Whoever reflects on the subject will find that from the inter­ <lb/>
            course of those who have loved one another for their moral <lb/>
            qualities no unpleasant consequences have arisen, but that by <lb/>
            impure connexions many direful evils have been caused.</p>
          <p>23. "I will now show you that the society of him who <lb/>
            loves the body rather than the mind is degrading ; for he who <lb/>
            instructs the object of his love to say and do what is right <lb/>
            would justly be honoured by him as Chiron and Phoenix <lb/>
            were honoured by Achilles; but he who desires corporeal <lb/>
            pleasure may deservedly follow about the object of his desire <lb/>
            like a beggar, for indeed he constantly attends on that object <note type="footnote"> 1 Schneider refers to Plato, Pheedr. sect. 38. </note> <pb n="186"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[CH. 8."/> <lb/>
            asking and entreating for a kiss or some other proof of attach­ <lb/>
            ment. 24. If I express myself somewhat more freely than ordi­ <lb/>
            nary, do not be surprised, for the wine excites me, and the <lb/>
            love that always dwells in me stimulates me to speak boldly <lb/>
            against that other kind of love which is of an opposite nature. <lb/>
            25. He who fixes his attention only on personal attractions <lb/>
            appears to me like a man who has hired a piece of land, for <lb/>
            such a man has no care that the land may be rendered more <lb/>
            valuable, but merely that he himself may extract as much <lb/>
            produce from it as possible ; but he who seeks for mutual <lb/>
            affection is more like a person who has land of his own ; <lb/>
            for by bringing into the mind of the beloved object whatever <lb/>
            he can from all quarters,1 he renders him constantly more <lb/>
            worthy of esteem. 26. Whatever beloved object, too, is con­ <lb/>
            scious that by displaying sufficient charms he will rule over <lb/>
            the lover, is likely to be regardless as to other matters; but <lb/>
            whoever knows that, unless by honourable and virtuous con­ <lb/>
            duct, there will be no possibility of securing affection, must <lb/>
            necessarily pay greater attention to moral rectitude. 27. But <lb/>
            the greatest benefit gained by him who desires to form a good <lb/>
            friend out of the object of his affections is that he himself is <lb/>
            obliged to pursue a virtuous course of conduct; or it is im­ <lb/>
            possible that he who indulges himself in what is wrong <lb/>
            should lead one that associates with him to do what is right; <lb/>
            nor that one who shows himself shameless and intemperate <lb/>
            should render the object of his affections temperate and <lb/>
            modest.</p>
          <p>28. "I would wish also, Callias," continued he, "to give you <lb/>
            some examples from the fables of antiquity, showing that not <lb/>
            only men, but gods and demi-gods, have valued the affection <lb/>
            of the mind more than any corporeal gratification. 29. With <lb/>
            whatever mortals, for instance, Jupiter fell in love on account <lb/>
            of their beauty, he allowed them, after he had enjoyed their <lb/>
            society, to remain mortals ; but those whom he admired for <lb/>
            the qualities of their minds he rendered immortal ; among <lb/>
            whom were Hercules, and Castor and Pollux; and some <lb/>
            others are mentioned. 30. I consider also that Ganymede <note type="footnote"> 1 As the owner of a piece of ground collects into it trees and plants <lb/>
            from all parts round about, so a man of virtue infuses wholesome pre­ <lb/>
            cepts, and the knowledge of everything that is good, into the mind of any <lb/>
            one that he loves. Weiske. </note> <pb n="187"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="§ 31—33.]"/> <lb/>
            was taken by Jupiter into heaven, not for the charms of his <lb/>
            person, but for those of his mind. To this supposition his <lb/>
            name gives support; for it is said somewhere in Homer, <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_29_fig9.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              which means, ‘ he is delighted with hearing ;' and there <lb/>
              occurs somewhere else, <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_29_fig10.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              which signifies, ‘ knowing wise counsels in his mind.' From <lb/>
              these two words he being named Ganymede,1 not as 'agree­ <lb/>
              able in persona but as 'agreeable in mind,' is honoured <lb/>
              among the gods. 31. Achilles too, Niceratus,2 is represented by <lb/>
              Homer as taking a glorious revenge for the death of Patro­ <lb/>
              clus, not as a mere object of affection, but as an intimate <lb/>
              friend. Orestes, also, and Pylades, and Theseus, and Peiri­ <lb/>
              thous, and many other of the chief demi-gods, are celebrated, <lb/>
              not because they enjoyed each other's love, but because, from <lb/>
              esteem for one another, they achieved together the greatest <lb/>
              and most honourable exploits. 32. Shall we not find, also, <lb/>
              that the glorious deeds done in modern times are achieved by <lb/>
              those who are willing to encounter toils and danger for the <lb/>
              sake of praise, rather than by those who habituate themselves <lb/>
              to love pleasure more than glory ? though Pausanias, indeed, <lb/>
              the friend of Agathon the poet,3 speaking in defence of <lb/>
              those who indulge in licentious gratifications, has said that <lb/>
              the strongest of armies might be formed of the corrupt and <lb/>
              those who are attached to them ; 33. for he declares himself <lb/>
              of opinion that such persons would feel utterly ashamed to <lb/>
              desert one another ; maintaining what is truly wonderful, if <lb/>
              those who are accustomed to disregard censure, and to cast off <lb/>
              shame before each other, would shrink most of all men from <note type="footnote"> I Socrates intimates that Ganymedes was compounded of <foreign xml:lang="grc">γάνυμαι</foreign>, " to <lb/>

              qualities of mind. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 He addresses himself to Niceratus, as being particularly acquainted <lb/>

              <note type="correspondsTo" n="[ CH. 8."/> <lb/>
              doing anything disgraceful. 34. He has however adduced <lb/>
              testimonies, saying that the Thebans and Eleians are of this <lb/>
              opinion ; for he observes that the objects of their affections, <lb/>
              though admitted into unrestrained intercourse with them, <lb/>
              are nevertheless ranged side by side with them in the field of <lb/>
              battle ; but this example, on which he dwells, is not generally <lb/>
              applicable, for such a practice, though common with those <lb/>
              people, is accounted dishonourable with us. To me, at least, <lb/>
              those who are thus ranged together appear like persons dis­ <lb/>
              trustful lest the objects of their affections, if separated from <lb/>
              them, should not perform the duties of brave men, 35. But <lb/>
              the Lacedæmonians, who think that if a person fixes his desire <lb/>
              on corporeal pleasure, he will never afterwards pursue honour <lb/>
              and virtue with success, make the objects of their affection so <lb/>
              perfectly good and brave, that, even among foreigners, and <lb/>
              when they are not ranged in the same field of action 1 with <lb/>
              those attached to them, they are nevertheless ashamed to <lb/>
              desert their companions in arms ; for they regard, not shame­ <lb/>
              lessness, but self-respect, as their goddess. 36. We are likely, <lb/>
              indeed, to be all of the same opinion with regard to the <lb/>
              subject on which I am speaking, if we but consider to which <lb/>
              of the two kinds of objects of affection any one of us would <lb/>
              with greater confidence intrust his money or children, or do <lb/>
              a kindness with the expectation of a return ; for I think <lb/>
              that even he who is enamoured with the personal beauty <lb/>
              of the individual whom he loves, would more readily place <lb/>
              such confidence in one who is amiable in mind.</p>
          <p>37. " As for you, Callias, it appears to me incumbent on you <lb/>
            to feel grateful to the gods for having inspired you with the <lb/>
            love of Autolycus ; for that he is a lover of honour is evident, <lb/>
            inasmuch as he has submitted to many toils, and great fatigue, <lb/>
            for the sake of being proclaimed victor in the pancratium. <lb/>
            38. But if he thought that he could not only honour himself <lb/>
            and his father, but would be able, through virtuous exertions, <lb/>
            to benefit his friends, and to extend the power of his country <lb/>
            by raising trophies over her enemies, and to become, by these <lb/>
            means, admired and renowned alike among Greeks and bar­ <lb/>
            barians, do you not think that he would pay the highest hon- <note type="footnote">1 I read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν τῃ̃ αὐτῃ̃ τάξει</foreign>, with Dindorf, instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν τῃ̃ αὐτῃ̃ πόλει</foreign>, <lb/>
            the common reading, of which commentators could make no satisfactory <lb/>
            sense. Linge had suggested <foreign xml:lang="grc">χώρᾳ</foreign>. </note> <pb n="189"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="§ 39—43.]"/> <lb/>
            ours to him whom he should regard as an efficient auxiliary <lb/>
            for the accomplishment of such views ? 39. If therefore you <lb/>
            desire to secure his attachment, you must consider by what <lb/>
            kind of knowledge Themistocles became capable of rendering <lb/>
            Greece free; you must reflect by what sort of accomplishments <lb/>
            Pericles gained the character of being the most able adviser <lb/>
            of his country; you must think how Solon advanced himself <lb/>
            in philosophy, so as to make the best laws for the state ; and <lb/>
            you must inquire how the Lacedæmonians exercise themselves, <lb/>
            so as to be considered the first of commanders (and the most <lb/>
            distinguished of the Spartans lodge with you from time to <lb/>
            time as proxeni).1 40. Be assured, that your country will soon <lb/>
            put herself into your hands, if you be but willing to undertake <lb/>
            the care of her ; for you have the highest qualifications for <lb/>
            the charge; you are of an honourable family, a priest of the <lb/>
            gods who are worshipped in the ceremonies instituted by <lb/>
            Erechtheus,2 and who also marched with Bacchus against the <lb/>
            barbarians;3 you appear at the present festival more deserv­ <lb/>
            ing of the priesthood than any one of your forefathers ; you <lb/>
            have a person eminently graceful in the eyes of your country­ <lb/>
            men, and a frame well fitted for enduring fatigue. 41. If I <lb/>
            speak to you more seriously than seems suitable for a ban­ <lb/>
            quet, do not be surprised that I do so; for I always continue, <lb/>
            as well as my country, to love those who are of good disposi­ <lb/>
            tions, and who are ardently desirous of distinguishing them­ <lb/>
            selves in virtuous pursuits.”</p>
          <p>42. The rest of the company then conversed on what <lb/>
            had just been said; but Autolycus continued to gaze on <lb/>
            Callias. Callias, glancing at him, said, " You will then, <lb/>
            Socrates, recommend me to the favour of the state, that I <lb/>
            may occupy myself in its affairs, and be always acceptable to <lb/>
            it." 43. " Such will assuredly be the case," rejoined Socrates, <note type="footnote">1 Entertainers or receivers of strangers from their own country; some­ <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>1. THUS ended this portion of the conversation. Autolycus <lb/>
            (for it was now time for him)1 arose to take a walk, and Lycon <lb/>
            his father, as he went out with him, turned towards Socrates, <lb/>
            and said, " Assuredly, Socrates, you appear to be me to a man <lb/>
            of honour and virtue."</p>
          <p>2. Soon after this, a sort of elevated couch was placed in <lb/>
            the middle of the room, and the Syracusan came in and said, <lb/>
            " My friends, Ariadne will now enter into the chamber occupied <lb/>
            by herself and Bacchus; and Bacchus, who has been drinking <lb/>
            a little with the other gods, will come in soon afterwards, and <lb/>
            approach her; and they will then amuse themselves together. <lb/>
            3. Ariadne immediately made her entrance, dressed as a bride, <lb/>
            and seated herself on the couch. Bacchus not yet appearing,2 <lb/>
            the Bacchic measure was played on the flute. All the com­ <lb/>
            pany now expressed their admiration of the dancing-master;3 <lb/>
            for Ariadne, as soon as she heard the music, put herself into <lb/>
            such attitudes that every one could understand that she heard <lb/>
            it with pleasure. She did not go to meet Bacchus, nor did <lb/>
            she rise up, but she plainly indicated that she could hardly <lb/>
            keep herself quiet. 4. When Bacchus came forward and <lb/>
            caught sight of her, he began to dance like a person delighted, <lb/>
            sat down upon her knees,4 embraced her and kissed her. She <note type="footnote">1 According to the rules of gymnastic training, it was now time for him <lb/>

            acted like a modest bride, but nevertheless lovingly returned <lb/>
            his embrace. The company, as they looked on, not only <lb/>
            clapped their hands, but called out Again !" 1 5. But it was <lb/>
            when Bacchus rose up, and raised Ariadne with him, that <lb/>
            they had the greatest reason to admire their acting, as they <lb/>
            kissed and embraced one another. The spectators, seeing how <lb/>
            beautiful Bacchus was, and how blooming Ariadne, and how <lb/>
            they kissed one another, not in pretence, but in earnest, were <lb/>
            all delighted as they beheld them. 6. They heard Bacchus <lb/>
            asking her whether she loved him, and Ariadne vowing <lb/>
            so earnestly that she did, that not only Bacchus but all <lb/>
            who were present would have sworn that the boy and girl <lb/>
            were in love with one another; for they resembled, not actors <lb/>
            who had been taught their parts, but lovers who had long <lb/>
            desired to do what they were now doing. 7. At last, when <lb/>
            the guests saw that they were embracing one another, and <lb/>
            seemed to be going to repose, such of them as were unmarried <lb/>
            vowed that they would marry, and such of them as were <lb/>
            married mounted their horses and rode off to join their wives; <lb/>
            while Socrates, and the others who stayed behind, proceeded, <lb/>
            with Callias, to accompany Lycon and his son in their walk. <lb/>
            Such was the termination of the banquet. <note type="footnote"> <foreign xml:lang="grc">Σβόων αὔθις</foreign>. ] Cried out " Encore !" " Repeti jubebant." </note></p><pb n="192"/>

            Zeune and Weiske give their voices in favour of its genuineness, <lb/>
            observing that it appears from Diogenes Laertius, Stobæus, Athe­ <lb/>
            næus, and other authors, that Xenophon wrote an Apology of <lb/>
            Socrates. But there is no proof that what we have before us under <lb/>
            that name is what Xenophon wrote.</p>
          <p>Whoever indeed can readily believe that Xenophon was the <lb/>
            author of a composition so fragmentary, dry, and spiritless, as <lb/>
            this, can have very little power of judging of Xenophon's style. <lb/>
            It perhaps proceeded, as Valckenaer remarks, from the same hand <lb/>
            that forged the last chapter of the Cyropædia.</p>

          <p>1. IT seems proper for me to relate also concerning Socrates <lb/>
            how he determined to act when he was brought to judgment, <lb/>
            with regard to his defence and the close of his life. Others <lb/>
            indeed have written on this subject, and all have expressed 1 <lb/>
            the boldness of his language ; whence it is certain that such <lb/>
            language was used by Socrates; but that he thought death <lb/>
            more eligible for him than life, they have not shown; so that <lb/>
            his haughtiness of speech appears to have been somewhat too <lb/>
            imprudent.</p>
          <p>2. Hermogenes the son of Hipponicus, however, was his <lb/>
            intimate friend, and has given such an account of him that his <lb/>
            boldness of language seems suitable to his resolution ; for he <lb/>
            has related that, when he observed him discoursing of any­ <lb/>
            thing else rather than what he should offer in his defence, he <lb/>
            said to him, 3. " Ought you not also to consider, my dear <lb/>
            Socrates, how you may defend yourself ? " and that Socrates <lb/>
            at first answered, "Do I not seem to you to have passed my whole <lb/>
            life meditating how to defend myself ? " but afterwards asked, <lb/>
            " How so ? Since I have constantly lived without doing any <lb/>
            wrong; and such conduct I consider to be the best prepar­ <lb/>
            ation for a defence." 4. But when Hermogenes agair <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">῎Ετυχον</foreign>. ] " Have attained," or “ succeeded in attaining ” it, so as to <lb/>
            convey a notion of it to others. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 See Mem. Soc. iv. 8. 4. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. III </note> <note type="footnote"> <unclear>0</unclear> </note> <pb n="194"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[§ 5-7"/> <lb/>
            remarked, " Do you not see, then, in looking to the tribunals <lb/>
            of the Athenians, how often the judges, misled by words, <lb/>
            have put to death persons altogether innocent; and how often <lb/>
            they have acquitted the guilty, either because they themselves <lb/>
            have taken pity on them under the influence of eloquence, or <lb/>
            because the accused have spoken in such a way as to gain <lb/>
            their favour ? " " But I can assure you," rejoined Socrates, <lb/>
            “ that though I have twice attempted to meditate on my <lb/>
            defence, the divine admonition constantly opposes me." 5. As <lb/>
            Hermogenes exclaimed, " You say what is very strange," <lb/>
            Socrates replied, "Do you think it strange, that it should <lb/>
            now appear to the divinity better for me to die ? Do you not <lb/>
            know that, to the present day, I would not concede to any <lb/>
            human being that he has lived better than I ? for, what was <lb/>
            most consolatory, I was conscious that my whole life was <lb/>
            passed religiously and uprightly, so that, while I had a very <lb/>
            fair opinion of myself, I found that those who associated with <lb/>
            me formed the same judgment concerning me. 6. But now, <lb/>
            if my age should be still prolonged, I know that I must <lb/>
            necessarily suffer the evils of old age, must find my sight and <lb/>
            hearing impaired, must become less apt to learn, and more <lb/>
            forgetful of what I have already learned; and, if I should feel <lb/>
            myself declining, and grow discontented with myself, how," <lb/>
            asked he, “ could I have any pleasure in continuing to live ? <lb/>
            7. But perhaps," added he, " the divinity, from benevolence, <lb/>
            provides for me not only to terminate my life at a proper <lb/>
            season, but also in the easiest possible manner ; for if sen­ <lb/>
            tence is now pronounced against me, it is certain that I shall <lb/>
            be allowed to die by that method which has been deemed the <lb/>
            most merciful by those who have meditated on the subject,1 <lb/>
            a method which causes least concern to the friends of the <lb/>
            sufferer,2 and inspires them with the utmost regret for him ;3 <lb/>
            for when the dying person leaves no unseemly or unpleasant <lb/>
            impression on the minds of those present,4 but gradually <note type="footnote"> 1 Those who have considered the condition of men dying under tl.e <lb/>

            mind able to retain its cheerfulness, must he not be deeply <lb/>
            mourned ?</p>
          <p>s. "But the gods justly opposed my meditation on my <lb/>
            speech," continued he, " when it appeared to us that means of <lb/>
            escape should in every way be sought;1 for it is evident that, <lb/>
            if I had succeeded in this, I should have doomed myself, instead <lb/>
            of quitting life now, to end it under suffering either from dis­ <lb/>
            ease or old age, on which all troubles, all privations of comfort, <lb/>
            concur to fall. 9. Assuredly, my dear Hermogenes,” said he, <lb/>
            " I shall think of no such course ; but if I shall offend the <lb/>
            judges by mentioning the honours which I think that I have <lb/>
            received from the gods and from men, and what opinion I <lb/>
            entertain concerning myself, I shall choose rather to die, than, <lb/>
            by ignobly entreating to live longer, to secure a life far more <lb/>
            dishonourable than death."</p>
          <p>10. When his adversaries brought their charge against him, <lb/>
            that he did not acknowledge the gods whom the state ac­ <lb/>
            knowledged, but introduced other new deities, and corrupted <lb/>
            the youth," Hermogenes stated that Socrates, adhering to the <lb/>
            resolution which I have just mentioned, stood forward and <lb/>
            said : 11. "In the first place, my countrymen, I am astonished <lb/>
            at Meletus, and at a loss to know on what he founds his asser­ <lb/>
            tion that I do not acknowledge the gods whom the state <lb/>
            acknowledges, since not only others, who were with me, have <lb/>
            seen me sacrificing at the common festivals, and on the public <lb/>
            altars, but Meletus himself might have seen me if he had de­ <lb/>
            sired to do so. 12. As to new deities, how can I introduce <lb/>
            any by saying that the voice of a god appears to signify to me <lb/>
            what I ought to do ? for those who consult the cries of birds, <lb/>
            and the speeches of men,2 take omens, assuredly, from voices ; <note type="footnote">of those about him, which are of an unseemly character, and unpleasing <lb/>
            in their eyes. Schneider. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 ‘<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ημι̃ν ζητητέα εἶναι ἐκ πάντος τρόπου τὰ ἀποφευκτικά</foreign>. ] By <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ <lb/>

            which the friends of Socrates had recommended to him. For <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡμι̃ν</foreign>, <lb/>
            therefore, which Dindorf retains, it would appear that we should read <lb/>
            with Weiske <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὐμι̃ν</foreign>. “ The divine influence was adverse to my premedi­ <lb/>
            tation of a speech for my defence, at the time when it seemed to you <lb/>
            that not only that means, but every other means of escape, ought to be <lb/>
            adopted by me." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 People drew omens from the mode in which those whom they </note> <note type="footnote"> o 2 </note> <pb n="196"/>

            and who will say that thunder is not a voice, or that it is not <lb/>
            a most influential omen ? Does not the priestess, too, on the <lb/>
            tripod at Delphi, declare with her voice the signs which she <lb/>
            receives from the gods ? 13. That the divinity, indeed, fore­ <lb/>
            knows what is to happen, and foretells it to whomsoever be <lb/>
            pleases, all men say and think exactly as I do ; but they call1 <lb/>
            the things or persons that signify the future auguries or <lb/>
            omens, diviners or soothsayers, while I call the power of pre­ <lb/>
            diction a divine manifestation, and I think that by designat­ <lb/>
            ing it thus, I speak with greater truth, and more reverentially, <lb/>
            than those who attribute the power of the gods to birds ; and <lb/>
            that I do not, in this case, speak falsely with regard to the di­ <lb/>
            vinity, I have manifest proof, since, though I have frequently <lb/>
            communicated the admonitions of the divinity to my friends, <lb/>
            I have never been found to deceive them."</p>
          <p>14. When the judges, on hearing this statement, gave loud <lb/>
            signs of disapprobation, some disbelieving what he said, and <lb/>
            others being displeased at the thought that he should obtain <lb/>
            greater favours from the gods than themselves, Socrates again <lb/>
            said, " Hear, then, something more, that those of you who <lb/>
            are inclined to be incredulous may feel still greater disbelief2 <lb/>
            in the assertion that I have been honoured by the gods ; for <lb/>
            when Chærephon, on one occasion, put a question to the <lb/>
            oracle at Delphi, in the presence of several persons, concern­ <lb/>
            ing me, Apollo replied that no one of all mankind was either <lb/>
            more liberal-minded, or more just, or more prudent, than my­ <lb/>
            self." is. As the judges, at hearing this, expressed, as was na­ <lb/>
            tural, still louder disapprobation, Socrates proceeded to say, <lb/>
            " Yet the same god, my fellow-citizens, uttered in an oracle a <lb/>
            higher eulogy concerning Lycurgus, who gave laws to the <lb/>
            Spartans, than concerning me ; for it is related3 that he <lb/>
            said to him as he was entering the temple, ‘ I am considering <lb/>
            whether I should call you a god or a man ;' but as for me, be <lb/>
            did not liken me to a god, but only expressed his judgment <lb/>
            that I far excelled other men. Yet do not hastily believe the <note type="footnote"> casually met addressed them. See the note on the translation of the <lb/>

            god on this subject, but consider every point in my character <lb/>
            severally, with reference to what the god said. 16. For whom <lb/>
            do you know less enslaved than myself to bodily pleasures ? <lb/>
            whom more liberal in mind than I am, who receive nei­ <lb/>
            ther presents nor remuneration from any one ? Or whom <lb/>
            would you reasonably consider more just than one who con­ <lb/>
            tents himself with what he has, so as to need nothing belong­ <lb/>
            ing to others ? Or how could any one honestly refuse to call <lb/>
            me a wise man, who, since I began to understand what was <lb/>
            said to me, have never ceased to seek and to learn whatever <lb/>
            good I could ? 17. That I have not laboured in vain, does <lb/>
            not this appear to you a sufficient proof, that many of our <lb/>
            citizens who are desirous of improvement in virtue, and <lb/>
            many foreigners also, prefer to associate with me above all <lb/>
            other men ? Or what shall we say is the reason that, though <lb/>
            all know that I am quite unable to make any return for what <lb/>
            I receive, yet numbers are desirous to bestow gifts upon me ? <lb/>
            Or that a return for a favour is never asked of me by any one, <lb/>
            though many acknowledge that they owe favours to me ? 1 <lb/>
            is. Or that, during the siege,2 other men lamented their lot, <lb/>
            while I felt no greater wants than when the city was in the <lb/>
            greatest prosperity ? Or that other men procure expensive <lb/>
            delicacies from the market, while I, without cost, produce <lb/>
            greater enjoyments than they from my own mind ? If, then, <lb/>
            in what I have said concerning myself, no man can convict <lb/>
            me of speaking falsely, must I not justly receive praise, at the <lb/>
            present time, both from gods and men ? 19. Yet you, Mele­ <lb/>
            tus, say that I, by such a course of conduct, corrupt the <lb/>
            youth. We however well know, doubtless, what the things <lb/>
            that corrupt youth are ; and tell me, I pray, whether you <lb/>
            know of any one having been drawn, by my influence, from <lb/>
            piety to impiety, from steadiness of conduct to licentiousness, <lb/>
            from economy to extravagance, from soberness to indulgence <lb/>
            in wine, from laboriousness to effeminacy, or brought under <lb/>
            the dominion of any vicious pleasure ? " <note type="footnote"> I The favours which people bestow upon me they regard as my <lb/>
            right, as having been merited by services either to themselves or to the <lb/>

          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="[§ 20—23."/> 20. " No," replied Meletus, "but I certainly know some <lb/>
            whom you have persuaded to obey you more than their <lb/>
            parents." " I admit that such has been the case," replied So­ <lb/>
            crates, " in regard to education ; for they know that that <lb/>
            subject has been my study ; and so, in matters concerning <lb/>
            their health, men place more reliance on physicians than on <lb/>
            their parents ; and, in the assemblies of the people, all the <lb/>
            Athenians, assuredly, pay more regard to those who speak <lb/>
            wisely than to their own relatives. In the election of gener­ <lb/>
            als, do you not choose, in preference to your fathers and <lb/>
            brothers, and even, most certainly, in preference to your <lb/>
            own selves, those whom you consider most skilful in military <lb/>
            affairs ? " " Doubtless,” replied Meletus, " for to do so is ex­ <lb/>
            pedient as well as customary." 21. "Does it not then appear <lb/>
            wonderful to you," said Socrates, " that, in other affairs, the <lb/>
            best men not only obtain fair consideration, but are even pre­ <lb/>
            ferred ; but that I, because I am thought eminent by some in <lb/>
            that which is the greatest good to men, I mean in the educa­ <lb/>
            tion of youth, am for this reason prosecuted by you as worthy <lb/>
            of death ? "</p>
          <p>22. Much more than this, it is well known, was said both by <lb/>
            Socrates himself, and by his friends, who took his part; but <lb/>
            I have not been anxious to relate all that occurred on his <lb/>
            trial; it is sufficient for me to show that Socrates made it his <lb/>
            great object, neither to act impiously towards the gods, nor to <lb/>
            be thought unjust towards men. Escape from death he did <lb/>
            not consider that he ought to solicit; he even thought that <lb/>
            the proper time was then come for him to die. 23. That he en­ <lb/>
            tertained this opinion became still more manifest after sen­ <lb/>
            tence was pronounced against him ; for, in the first place, when <lb/>
            he was urged by his friends to solicit a lesser penalty,1 he <lb/>
            neither offered to pay any pecuniary fine himself, nor allow­ <lb/>
            ed his friends to do so, but said that to pay a fine was for <lb/>
            one who confessed himself guilty; and, in the second place, <note type="footnote">1 ‘<foreign xml:lang="grc">Υποτιμᾶσϑαι</foreign>.] This word properly signifies to propose a less pen­ <lb/>
            alty for one's self than that which has been fixed by the accuser. The <lb/>
            penalty demanded by Meletus, in the form of accusation against Socrates, <lb/>
            was death. Socrates might have applied, when judgment was pronounced <lb/>
            against him, for a commutation of punishment, stating that he thought <lb/>
            himself not deserving of death, but was ready to pay a fine. Instead of <lb/>
            doing so, he asserted that he deserved to be maintained at the public ex­ <lb/>
            pense in the Prytaneum. See Cicero de Orate 1. 54. </note> <pb n="199"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="§ 24—27.]"/> <lb/>
            when his friends offered to effect his escape secretly, he did <lb/>
            not consent, but seems to have jested with them, by asking <lb/>
            whether they knew any place out of Attica where death could <lb/>
            not come.</p>
          <p>24. As the trial came to a conclusion, he said, "But, my <lb/>
            fellow-citizens, those who have instructed the witnesses to <lb/>
            bear false testimony against me by perjuring themselves, and <lb/>
            those who have yielded to their persuasions, must necessarily <lb/>
            be conscious to themselves of having committed great impiety <lb/>
            and injustice. But what cause is there for me to think less <lb/>
            of myself now than before my condemnation, when I have <lb/>
            not been convicted of having done any one of those things <lb/>
            which the accuser has laid to my charge ?1 for it has neither <lb/>
            been shown that I have sacrificed to any new deities, instead of <lb/>
            Jupiter and Juno, and the gods worshipped with them, nor that <lb/>
            I have sworn by any other gods, or have acknowledged any. <lb/>
            25. As to the youth, how could I corrupt them by accustom­ <lb/>
            ing them to patience and frugality ? In regard to deeds for <lb/>
            which the penalty appointed is death, as sacrilege, house-break­ <lb/>
            ing, selling men for slaves, treachery towards the state, not <lb/>
            even my accusers themselves charge me with having done <lb/>
            anything of that kind ; so that it seems to me marvellous how <lb/>
            any act worthy of death could ever have appeared to you to <lb/>
            have been committed by me. 26. Nor ought I, assuredly, to <lb/>
            think less of myself because I die unjustly ; for this is not dis­ <lb/>
            honourable to me, but to those who have condemned me. <lb/>
            Palamedes, too, who met death in a similar way with myself, <lb/>
            offers consolation to me; for he affords, even to the present <lb/>
            day, a finer subject for song than Ulysses, who unjustly caused <lb/>
            his death.2 I know that testimony will be borne to me, both <lb/>
            by time that is coming, and by time that is already past, that <lb/>
            I have never wronged any man, or made any one worse than <lb/>
            I found him, but that I improved those who conversed with <lb/>
            me, by teaching them gratuitously whatever good I found in <lb/>
            my power."</p>
          <p>27. Having uttered these words, he withdrew in a manner <note type="footnote"> I ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Εγράψατο</foreign>.] Zeune and some other editors reaa <foreign xml:lang="grc">εγράψαντο</foreign>: but <lb/>

            suitable to what he had spoken, with cheerfulness in his looks, <lb/>
            gesture, and gait. But, when he observed those who attended <lb/>
            him weeping, he said, “ How is this ? Do you now weep ? <lb/>
            Do you not know that from the moment at which I was born, <lb/>
            death was decreed for me by nature? If, indeed, I were dying <lb/>
            amidst blessings showered upon me, it is certain that both I <lb/>
            and my friends would have to grieve ; but if I am ending my <lb/>
            life when troubles are to be expected, I think you ought all <lb/>
            to rejoice for me, as being happy."</p>
          <p>28. A person named Apollodorus, who was present, a great <lb/>
            admirer of Socrates, but, otherwise, of weak understanding, <lb/>
            said, " I grieve most on this account, Socrates, that I see you <lb/>
            going to die undeservedly;" when it is said that Socrates, <lb/>
            stroking the head of Apollodorus, asked, "And would you, <lb/>
            my dearest Apollodorus, rather see me die deservedly than <lb/>
            undeservedly?” Socrates, as he said this, smiled upon him.</p>
          <p>29. It is related, also, that on seeing Anytus pass by, he <lb/>
            remarked, " This man is elated, as if he had done something <lb/>
            great and honourable in causing my death, because, when I <lb/>
            saw him thought worthy of the highest offices by the state,' <lb/>
            I said that he ought not to bring up his son among ox-hides.2 <lb/>
            How foolish is he," added Socrates, " who does not seem to <lb/>
            know that whichsoever of us has done that which is more <lb/>
            beneficial and more honourable for all time, is the superior! <lb/>
            30. But, he continued, "Homer has attributed to some of his <lb/>
            personages3 the faculty of foreseeing the future at the end of <lb/>
            their lives; and I am desirous also of uttering something in <lb/>
            the manner of a prophecy. I had the company, for a short <lb/>
            time, of Anytus's son ; and he appeared to me to be not with­ <lb/>
            out vigour of mind; and I therefore predict that he will not <lb/>
            continue at the servile occupation which his father has destined <lb/>
            for him, but that, as he has no efficient guardian, he will <lb/>
            plunge himself into some licentious gratification and advance <lb/>
            far into vice." In making this prediction, Socrates was not <lb/>
            deceived ; for the young man, conceiving a passion for wine, <lb/>
            ceased neither night nor day from drinking, and at last became <note type="footnote">1 As is also said in Plato's Menon, sect. 18. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Anytus appears to have been a dealer in hides.

            worthless alike to his country, his friends, and himself. <lb/>
            Anytus, on account of his bad education of his son, and his <lb/>
            own folly, is loaded with infamy, even now that he is dead.</p>
          <p>31. But Socrates, incurring odium through magnifying <lb/>
            himself before the tribunal, afforded the more inducement to <lb/>
            his judges to pronounce sentence against him. To me, how­ <lb/>
            ever, he appears to have met with a fate appointed by the <lb/>
            kindness of the gods ; for he was freed from the most trouble­ <lb/>
            some part of life, and suffered the easiest of death.32. He <lb/>
            gave a proof of the firmness of his mind ; for as lie felt that to <lb/>
            die was better for him than to live, he, as he had never been <lb/>
            averse to anything else that was good, did not show want of <lb/>
            spirit to meet death, but welcomed it and submitted to it with <lb/>
            cheerfulness. For myself, observing his wisdom and noble­ <lb/>
            ness of mind, I cannot forbear to think of him, or, while I <lb/>
            think of him, to praise him. But if any one, among those <lb/>
            who are studious of virtue, has met with a more beneficial <lb/>
            instructor than Socrates, I consider him to be of all mankind <lb/>
            the most deserving of congratulation.</p><pb n="202"/>

            <title type="main">PREFATORY REMARKS CONCERNING THE TREATISES ON THE LACEDÆMONIAN AND ATHENIAN GOVERNMENTS.</title>
          </head>
          <p>THE minute attention which I have necessarily given to the <lb/>
            style of these Treatises in translating them induces me to form a <lb/>
            much more unfavourable opinion with regard to their genuineness <lb/>
            than I conceived when I read them for the first time some years ago. <lb/>
            In the Life of Xenophon prefixed to the previous volume, I said, <lb/>
            relying on my own early impressions and the judgment of Weiske, <lb/>
            that there was nothing in the style or manner of the treatises to <lb/>
            prove that Xenophon was not their author. Nor is there so much <lb/>
            discrepancy in the style of them from that of Xenophon's acknow­ <lb/>
            ledged works as to make it clear to all readers that Xenophon did <lb/>
            not write them; for, as Weiske observes, mere dissimilitude of dic­ <lb/>
            tion will not suffice to demonstrate that they are spurious, since a <lb/>
            writer may, for various reasons, adopt different forms of style in <lb/>
            different compositions. But the numerous repetitions of the same <lb/>
            phrases in the treatise on the Lacedæmonian Government, and the <lb/>
            curtness and aridity of the phraseology, seem to convict the writer <lb/>
            of a poverty of words never chargeable upon Xenophon ; and I am <lb/>
            now, therefore, inclined to think with Heyne, Heindorf, and F. A. <lb/>
            Wolf, that they are the work of some other writer than the Attic <lb/>
            bee. As to the style of the Treatise on the Athenian Government, it <lb/>
            certainly approaches nearer to that of Xenophon, in structure and <lb/>
            flow, than the style of the other, but is still far beneath the excel­ <lb/>
            lence of the master's own compositions. With regard to the <lb/>
            matter, in both treatises, especially in that on the Lacedæmonian <lb/>
            Government, much of it is so extremely poor and trifling, that it <lb/>
            cannot be thought to have proceeded from Xenophon.</p><pb n="203"/>
            
          <p>That Xenophon wrote Treatises on the Lacedaemonian and <lb/>
            Athenian Governments is mennoned by Diogenes Laertius and <lb/>
            other writers ; but the genuineness of the books on those subjects <lb/>
            which were in circulation under his name in early times was denied <lb/>
            by Demetrius of Magnesia, a contemporary of Cicero. Longinus <lb/>
            cites a few words from the treatise on the Government of the Lace­ <lb/>
            daemonians as Xenophon's, but with some variation from the pre­ <lb/>
            sent text. Whether therefore the original treatises have been lost, <lb/>
            and others substituted by an inferior hand, or whether they have <lb/>
            been mutilated, and the deficiencies supplied by some unskilful <lb/>
            essayist at reparation, must remain doubtful. The question is fully <lb/>
            discussed by Sauppe in the preface to his edition of Schneider. <lb/>
            Sauppe tries to prove both pieces genuine.</p>
          <p>That the fourteenth chapter of the Treatise on the Lacedaemonian <lb/>
            Government is, if not spurious, certainly out of place, is admitted <lb/>
            by Weiske, Schneider, and Dindorf.</p><pb n="204"/>

          <p>The regulations of Lycurgus respecting marriage and the treatment of <lb/>
            children.</p>
          <p>1. BUT1 reflecting once how Sparta, one of the least popu­ <lb/>
            tous of states,2 had proved the most powerful and celebrated <lb/>
            city3 in Greece, I wondered by what means this result had <lb/>
            been produced. When I proceeded, however, to contemplate <lb/>
            the institutions of the Spartans, I wondered no longer.</p>
          <p>2. Lycurgus, who made laws for them, by obedience to <note type="footnote"> 1 The commencement is abrupt, as if some preceding portion were <lb/>
            lost. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 A small population of citizens, not of human beings, is signified. <lb/>
            Yet the state may well be said to have had but a small population, <lb/>
            whether we look merely to the Spartans, or inhabitants of the city itself, <lb/>
            or include in the computation all that could properly be called Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nians, or all that had the right of citizenship. Weiske. At the time <lb/>
            when Sparta was most flourishing, the number of Spartans was eight thou­ <lb/>
            sand, according to Herodotus, vii. 234, or, according to Aristotle, Polit. <lb/>
            ii. 6, ten thousand. The number of the inhabitants of Laconia amounted <lb/>
            to about three hundred and eighty thousand, according to Muller, Dori­ <lb/>
            ans ii. 47; and the number of Spartans after their losses at Leuctra was <lb/>
            not more than three thousand. Sauppe. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Celebrated as being powerful. Its power became most remarkable <lb/>
            in the Peloponnesian war, and especially about the 93rd Olympiad, <lb/>
            when they defeated the Athenians at Ægospotami; from which period <lb/>
            they held the sovereignty in Greece until the l02nd Olympiad, when the <lb/>
            battle of Leuctra was fought, and when they were so weakened by the <lb/>
            Thebans that they never after recovered themselves. Weiske </note> <pb n="205"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="§ 3-7.]"/> <lb/>
            which they have flourished, I not only admire, but consider to <lb/>
            have been in the fullest sense a wise man ; for he rendered his <lb/>
            country preëminent in prosperity, not by imitating other <lb/>
            states, but by making ordinances contrary to those of most <lb/>
            governments.</p>
          <p>3. With regard, for example, to the procreation of children, <lb/>
            that I may begin from the beginning, other people feed their <lb/>
            young women, who are about to produce offspring, and who <lb/>
            are of the class regarded as well brought up, on the most <lb/>
            moderate quantity of vegetable food possible, and on the least <lb/>
            possible quantity of meat, while they either keep them from <lb/>
            wine altogether, or allow them to use it only when mixed <lb/>
            with water ; and as the greater number of the men engaged <lb/>
            in trades are sedentary, so the rest of the Greeks think it <lb/>
            proper that their young women should sit quiet and spin <lb/>
            wool. But how can we expect that women thus treated <lb/>
            should produce a vigorous progeny ? 4. Lycurgus, on the <lb/>
            contrary, thought that female slaves were competent to <lb/>
            furnish clothes ; and, considering that the production of chil­ <lb/>
            dren was the noblest duty of the free, he enacted, in the first <lb/>
            place, that the female should practise bodily exercises no less <lb/>
            than the male sex ; and he then appointed for the women con­ <lb/>
            tests with one another, just as for the men, expecting that <lb/>
            when both parents were rendered strong, a stronger offspring <lb/>
            would be born from them.</p>
          <p>5. Observing, too, that the men of other nations, when <lb/>
            women were united to husbands, associated with their wives, <lb/>
            during the early part of their intercourse, without restraint, <lb/>
            he made enactments quite at variance with this practice; for <lb/>
            he ordained that a man should think it shame to be seen <lb/>
            going in to his wife, or coming out from her. When married <lb/>
            people meet in this way, they must feel stronger desire for the <lb/>
            company of one another, and whatever offspring is produced <lb/>
            must thus be rendered far more robust than if the parents <lb/>
            were satiated with each others society.</p>
          <p>6. In addition to these regulations, he also took from the <lb/>
            men the liberty of marrying when each of them pleased, and <lb/>
            appointed that they should contract marriages only when they <lb/>
            were in full bodily vigour, deeming this injunction also con­ <lb/>
            ducive to the production of an excellent offspring. 7. Seeing <lb/>
            also that if old men chanced to have young wives, they watch- <pb n="206"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[CH. 2."/> <lb/>
            ed their wives with the utmost strictness, he made a law <lb/>
            quite opposed to this feeling ; for he appointed that an old man <lb/>
            should introduce to his wife whatever man in the prime of <lb/>
            life he admired for his corporeal and mental qualities, in order <lb/>
            that she might have children by him. 8. If, again, a man <lb/>
            was unwilling to associate with his wife, and yet was desirous <lb/>
            of having proper children, he made a provision also with re­ <lb/>
            spect to him, that whatever woman he saw likely to have off­ <lb/>
            spring, and of good disposition, he might, on obtaining the <lb/>
            consent of her husband, have children by her. 9. Many simi­ <lb/>
            lar permission he gave; for the women are willing to have <lb/>
            two families,1 and the men to receive brothers to their children, <lb/>
            who are equal to them in birth and standing, but have no <lb/>
            claim to share in their property.</p>
          <p>10. Let him who wishes, then, consider whether Lycurgus, <lb/>
            in thus making enactments different from those of other legis­ <lb/>
            lators, in regard to the procreation of children, secured for <lb/>
            Sparta a race of men eminent for size and strength.2</p>

          <p>On the training and education of children.</p>
          <p>i. HAVING given this account of the procreation of children, <lb/>
            I wish also to detail the education of those of both sexes.3 <note type="footnote"> 1 The sense is made clear by reference to a passage of Plutarch in his <lb/>
            Comparison of Lycurgus and Numa, c. 4, and to another in the Life of <lb/>
            Cato the Younger, c. 25 ; whence it appears that a woman transferred <lb/>
            herself from the house and family of her first husband into the house and <lb/>
            family of a second, the change being sanctioned by her father and by <lb/>
            her first husband, to whose property and protection she gave up all claims. <lb/>

            amidst this state of licence, which set aside all distinction between hon­ <lb/>
            ourable marriage and illicit love, between legitimate and illegitimate off­ <lb/>
            spring, adultery was unknown; as if such a condition of things was not <lb/>
            a constant indulgence in adultery, sanctioned by common practice. <lb/>

            Of the other Greeks, those who say that they bring up their <lb/>
            sons best set slaves over them to take charge of them,1 as <lb/>
            soon as the children can understand what is said to them, and <lb/>
            send them, at the same time, to schoolmasters, to learn letters, <lb/>
            and music, and the exercises of the palæstra. They also <lb/>
            render their children's feet delicate by the use of sandals, and <lb/>
            weaken their bodies by changes of clothes; and as to food, <lb/>
            they regard their appetite as the measure of what they are to <lb/>
            take. 2. But Lycurgus, instead of allowing each citizen to <lb/>
            set slaves as guardians over his children, appointed a man to <lb/>
            have the care of them all, one of those from whom the chief <lb/>
            magistrates are chosen ; and he is called the Pædonomus. <lb/>
            He invested this man with full authority to assemble the boys. <lb/>
            and, if he found that any one was negligent of his duties, to <lb/>
            punish him severely. He assigned him also some of the <lb/>
            grown-up boys as scourge-bearers, that they might inflict <lb/>
            whatever chastisement was necessary; so that great dread of <lb/>
            disgrace, and great willingness to obey, prevailed among them.</p>
          <p>3. Instead, also, of making their feet soft with sandals, he <lb/>
            enacted that they should harden them by going without san­ <lb/>
            dals ; thinking that, if they exercised themselves in this state, <lb/>
            they would go up steep places with far greater ease, and de­ <lb/>
            scend declivities with greater safety; and that they would <lb/>
            also leap, and skip, and run faster unshod, if they had their <lb/>
            feet inured to doing so, than shod. 4. Instead of being ren­ <lb/>
            dered effeminate, too, by a variety of dresses, he made it a <lb/>
            practice that they should accustom themselves to one dress <lb/>
            throughout the year; thinking that they would thus be better <lb/>
            prepared to endure cold and heat.</p>
          <p>5. As to food, he ordained that they should exhort the boys2 <lb/>
            to take only such a quantity as never to be oppressed with <lb/>
            repletion, and not to be strangers to living somewhat frugally ; <lb/>

            better able, if they should be required, to support toil under a <lb/>

            exertion, should it be imposed on them, on the same quantity <lb/>
            of provisions, and would be less desirous of sauces, more easily <lb/>
            satisfied with any kind of food, and pass their lives in greater <lb/>
            health. * He also considered that the fare which rendered the <lb/>
            body slender would be more conducive to increasing its stature <lb/>
            than that which expanded it with nutriment. 6. Yet that <lb/>
            the boys might not suffer too much from hunger, Lycurgus, <lb/>
            though he did not allow them to take what they wanted with­ <lb/>
            out trouble, gave them liberty to steal certain things to relieve <lb/>
            the cravings of nature; and he made it honourable to steal as <lb/>
            many cheeses as possible.1 7. That he did not give them <lb/>
            leave to form schemes for getting food because he was at a <lb/>
            loss what to allot them, I suppose no one is ignorant; as it is <lb/>
            evident that he who designs to steal must be wakeful during <lb/>
            the night, and use deceit, and lay plots; and, if he would gaii <lb/>
            anything of consequence, must employ spies. All these things, <lb/>
            therefore, it is plain that he taught the children from a desire <lb/>
            to render them more dexterous in securing provisions, and <lb/>
            better qualified for warfare.</p>
          <p>8. Some one may say, “ Why, then, if he thought it hon­ <lb/>
            ourable to steal, did he inflict a great number of stripes on <lb/>
            him who was caught in the fact ?” I answer, that in other <lb/>
            things which men teach, they punish him who does not follow <lb/>
            his instructions properly; and that the Lacedæmonians ac­ <lb/>
            cordingly punished those who were detected as having at­ <lb/>
            tempted to steal in an improper manner. These boys he gave <lb/>
            in charge to others to scourge them at the altar of Diana <lb/>
            Orthia ;2 designing to show by this enactment that it is pos­ <lb/>
            sible for a person, after enduring pain for a short time, to <lb/>
            enjoy pleasure with credit for a long time.3 It is also shown <note type="footnote"> 1 The original of this phrase about the cheeses is transferred to this <lb/>
            place, on the suggestion of Schneider, from sect. 9, where it encumbers <lb/>
            the sense. " The Lacedæmonians ate a great deal of cheese ; five mince <lb/>
            of cheese was one of the contributions to the phiditia ; and it was perhaps <lb/>
            some of this cheese that the boys who were, according to the Spartan <lb/>
            custom, admitted to the phiditia, were accustomed to steal." Such is the <lb/>
            notion of Zeune ; and that food used to be stolen by the boys from the <lb/>
            phiditia is stated by Plutarch, Lycurg. c. 17. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Diana was so called, says Hesychius, from a place in Arcadia, where <lb/>

            by this punishment that, where there is need of activity, the <lb/>
            inert person benefits himself the least, and occasions himself <lb/>
            most trouble.</p>
          <p>10. In order, too, that the boys, in case of the pædonomus <lb/>
            being absent, may never be in want of a president, he ap­ <lb/>
            pointed that whoever of the citizens may happen at any time <lb/>
            to be present is to assume the direction of them, and to enjoin <lb/>
            whatever he may think advantageous for them, and punish <lb/>
            them if they do anything wrong. By doing this, Lycurgus <lb/>
            has also succeeded in rendering the boys much more modest; <lb/>
            for neither boys nor men respect any one so much as their <lb/>
            rulers. 11. And that if, on any occasion, no full-grown man <lb/>
            happen to be present, the boys may not even in that case be <lb/>
            without a leader, he ordained that the most active of the <lb/>
            grown-up youths take the command of each band; so that <lb/>
            the boys there are never without a superintendent.</p>
          <p>12. It appears to me that I must say something also of the <lb/>
            boys as objects of affection ; for this has likewise some refer­ <lb/>
            ence to education. Among the other Greeks, a man and boy <lb/>
            either form a union, as among the Bœotians, and associate <lb/>
            together, or, as among the Eleians, the men gain the favour <lb/>
            of the youths by means of attentions bestowed upon them; <lb/>
            but there are some of the Greeks who prohibit the suitors for <lb/>
            the boys' favours from having the least conversation with <lb/>
            them. 13. But Lycurgus, acting contrary to all these people <lb/>
            also, thought proper, if any man, being himself such as be <lb/>
            ought to be, admired the disposition of a youth, and made -it <lb/>
            his object to render him a faultless friend, and to enjoy his <lb/>
            society, to bestow praise upon him, and regarded this as the <lb/>
            most excellent kind of education; but if any man showed that <lb/>
            his affections were fixed only on the bodily attractions of a <lb/>
            youth, Lycurgus, considering this as most unbecoming, ap­ <lb/>
            pointed that at Lacedæmon suitors for the favours of boys <lb/>
            should abstain from intimate connexion with them, not less <lb/>
            strictly than parents abstain from such intercourse with their <lb/>
            children, or children of the same family from that with one <lb/>
            another. 14. That such a state of things is disbelieved by <lb/>
            some, I am not surprised; for in most states the laws are not <lb/>
            at all adverse to the love of youths; but Lycurgus, for his <lb/>
            part, took such precautions with reference to it. <note type="footnote"> VOL. III. </note> <note type="footnote"> p </note> <pb n="210"/>

          <p>On the discipline of the young men.</p>
          <p>I. WHEN boys pass from the condition of children to that <lb/>
            of young men, the rest of the Greeks withdraw them from the <lb/>
            charge of the slaves who have had the care of them, and with­ <lb/>
            draw them at the same time from the schools, when no one <lb/>
            any longer directs them, but the authorities allow them to live <lb/>
            according to their own pleasure. 2. Lycurgus, however, made <lb/>
            enactments at variance with this custom; for observing that <lb/>
            in youths of such an age there is naturally the greatest spirit, <lb/>
            the greatest presumption apparent in their conduct, and the <lb/>
            keenest desire of pleasure prevailing in their minds, he im­ <lb/>
            posed upon them, at that period of life, the most constant toil, <lb/>
            and contrived as much occupation for them as possible. 3. <lb/>
            Enacting in addition, too, that if any one should shrink from <lb/>
            these exercises, he should afterwards be eligible to no kind of <lb/>
            honours, he occasioned that not only the public magistrates,1 <lb/>
            but those who had the charge also of individuals, took care <lb/>
            that they might not, by indolent neglect of their duty, become <lb/>
            utterly disreputable in the state.</p>
          <p>4. Besides, as he wished to engender in them the deepest <lb/>
            feelings of modesty, he enjoined them, when they were on the <lb/>
            public roads, to keep both their hands under their dress, to <lb/>
            walk along in silence, not to look round in any direction, but <lb/>
            to keep their eyes on what was before their feet. 5. Hence it <lb/>
            was made manifest that the male sex is more susceptible of <lb/>
            acquiring modesty than even the female; for you would hear <lb/>
            no more sound of a voice from them than from stone statues; <lb/>
            you would have as much difficulty in turning their eyes as if <lb/>
            they were made of brass; you would esteem them more bash­ <lb/>
            ful than even virgins in the bridal chamber; and when they <lb/>
            came into the philition,2 you must be content to hear only <lb/>
            what was asked of them. <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τοὺς, ἐκ δημοσίου</foreign>.] By these words Haas understands all magistrates <lb/>

            ought to be temperate, let him who pleases consider.</p>

          <p>Regulations respecting those of mature and advanced age.</p>
          <p>1. ON the full-grown men, however, he bestowed the most <lb/>
            anxious attention ; as he thought that they, if they proved <lb/>
            such as they ought to be, would have the greatest influence <lb/>
            in promoting the welfare of the state. 2. Observing, there­ <lb/>
            fore, that among whatever people emulation was excited, <lb/>
            their bands of singers were most deserving of being heard, and <lb/>
            their gymnastic contests most worthy of being seen, he con­ <lb/>
            sidered that if he could match the youth with one another in <lb/>
            a contest for meritorious distinction, they would thus un­ <lb/>
            doubtedly arrive at the greatest eminence in manly excellence. <lb/>
            How he stimulated them, accordingly, to contend with one <lb/>
            another, I will relate.</p>
          <p>3. From the men in the full vigour of life the ephori <lb/>
            choose three, who are called Hippagretæ. Each of these <lb/>
            makes choice of a hundred others, explaining for what reasons <lb/>
            he prefers some and rejects others. 4. Those who do not <lb/>
            obtain this honour are at strife as well with those who have <lb/>
            rejected them, as with those who have been preferred to <lb/>
            them ; and they also keep strict watch over one another, lest <lb/>
            they should act at all laxly, contrary to what is considered <lb/>
            honourable.</p>
          <p>5. Such strife is both highly acceptable to the gods, and <lb/>
            extremely beneficial to the community ; for in it is shown what <lb/>
            a good citizen ought to do; and the people exercise themselves <lb/>
            individually that they may always be in good condition, and <note type="footnote"> of the Lacedæmonians, the same as the syssitia. Some suppose <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φειδίτια</foreign>, <lb/>
            or <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φειδίτια</foreign>, to be a mere corruption of <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φιλίτια</foreign>, and that the word is actu­ <lb/>
            ally from <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φίλος</foreign>. </note> <note type="footnote"> P 2 </note> <pb n="212"/>

            may severally support the state, if it be at all necessary, with <lb/>
            all their might. 6. They must also attend to their health, for <lb/>
            in consequence of this emulation, they engage in boxing <lb/>
            with one another, whenever they chance to meet ; but any <lb/>
            person who comes up on the occasion has full power to sepa­ <lb/>
            rate the combatants ; and if either disobeys him that would <lb/>
            separate them, the pædonomus takes him before the ephori, <lb/>
            who inflict a heavy penalty upon him, as they wish to prevent <lb/>
            anger from ever prevailing so far as to be the cause of dis­ <lb/>
            obedience to the laws.</p>
          <p>7. As to those who have passed the age of puberty, and <lb/>
            from whom the chief officers of state are chosen, the rest of <lb/>
            the Greeks, though they exempt them from the cultivation of <lb/>
            their strength, nevertheless require them to serve in the field; <lb/>
            but Lycurgus made it a custom that it should be honourable <lb/>
            for persons of that age to engage in hunting, unless any pub­ <lb/>
            lic business hindered them, that they might be able, no less <lb/>
            than the younger men, to endure the hardships of war.</p>

          <p>Meals taken in public. On temperance.</p>
          <p>1. THE employments which Lycurgus appointed for each <lb/>
            period of life have now been almost all specified. What <lb/>
            mode of living he instituted for all the citizens, I will next <lb/>
            endeavour to explain.</p>
          <p>2. Lycurgus, then, having found the Spartans, like the <lb/>
            other Greeks, taking their meals1 at home, and knowing that <lb/>
            most were guilty of excess at them, caused their meals to be <lb/>
            taken in public, thinking that his regulations would thus be less <lb/>
            likely to be transgressed. 3. He appointed them such a quan­ <lb/>
            tity of food, that they should neither be overfed nor feel <lb/>
            stinted. Many extraordinary supplies2 are also furnished <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Σκηνου̃ντας</foreign>.] Answering pretty much to our word " living." Sturz <lb/>

            from what is caught in hunting, and for these the rich some­ <lb/>
            times contribute bread;1 so that the table is never without <lb/>
            provisions, as long as they design the meal to last, and yet is <lb/>
            never expensive.</p>
          <p>4. Having put a stop likewise to all unnecessary drinking, <lb/>
            which weakens alike the body and the mind, he gave permis­ <lb/>
            sion that every one should drink when he was thirsty, think. <lb/>
            ing that the drink would thus be most innoxious and most <lb/>
            pleasant. When they take their meals together in this man­ <lb/>
            ner, how can any one ruin either himself or his family by <lb/>
            gluttony or drunkenness ? 5. In other states, equals in age <lb/>
            generally associate together, and with them modesty has but <lb/>
            very little influence ; but Lycurgus, at Sparta, mixed citizens <lb/>
            of different ages, so that the younger are for the most part <lb/>
            instructed by the experience of the older. 6. It is a custom <lb/>
            at these public meals, that whatever any one has done to his <lb/>
            honour in the community is related; so that insolence, or <lb/>
            disorder from intoxication, or any indecency in conduct or <lb/>
            language, has there no opportunity of showing itself. 7 . The <lb/>
            practice of taking meals away from home is also attended <lb/>
            with these advantages, that the people are obliged to walk <lb/>
            in taking their departure homewards, and to be careful that <lb/>
            they may not stagger from the effects of wine, knowing that <lb/>
            they will not remain where they dined, and that they must <lb/>
            conduct themselves in the night just as in the day; for it is not <lb/>
            allowable for any one who is still liable to military duty2 to <lb/>
            walk with a torch.</p>
          <p>8. As Lycurgus observed, too, that those who, after taking <lb/>
            food, exercise themselves, become well-complexioned, plump, <lb/>
            and robust, while those who are inactive are puffy, unhealthy­ <lb/>
            looking, and feeble, he did not neglect to give attention to <lb/>
            that point ; and as he perceived that when any one engages <lb/>
            in labour from his own inclination, he proves himself to have <lb/>
            his body in efficient condition, he ordered that the oldest <note type="footnote"> I Aprov <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀντιπαϱαβάλλουσι</foreign>.] Neither of the prepositions in this word, <lb/>

            food.1 9. With regard to this matter, he appears to me to <lb/>
            have been by no means mistaken; for no one would easily <lb/>
            find men more healthy, or more able-bodied, than the Spar­ <lb/>
            tans ; for they exercise themselves alike in their legs, in their <lb/>
            hands, and in their shoulders.</p>

            <title type="sub">CHAPTER VI.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Ordinances regarding children, slaves, and property.</p>
          <p>1. IN the following particulars, also, he made enactments <lb/>
            contrary to the usage of most states; for in other communi­ <lb/>
            ties each individual has the control over his own children, <lb/>
            and servants, and property; but Lycurgus, wishing to order <lb/>
            things so that the citizens might enjoy some advantage from <lb/>
            one another, unattended with any reciprocal injury, ordained <lb/>
            that each should have authority not only over his own chil­ <lb/>
            dren, but over those of others. 2. But when a person is con­ <lb/>
            scious that his fellow-citizens are fathers of the children over <lb/>
            whom he exercises authority, he must exercise it in such a <lb/>
            way as he would wish it to be exercised over his own. If a <lb/>
            boy, on any occasion, receive blows from another boy, and <lb/>

            able in the father not to inflict additional blows on his son. <lb/>
            Thus they trust to one another to impose nothing disgraceful <lb/>
            on the children.</p>
          <p>3. He enacted also that a person might use his neighbour's <lb/>
            servants, if he had need of them. He introduced, too, a com­ <lb/>
            munity of property in hunting-dogs ; so that those who re­ <lb/>
            quire them call on their owner to hunt, who, if he is not at <lb/>
            leisure to hunt himself, cheerfully sends them out. They use <lb/>
            horses also in like manner ; for whoever is sick, or wants a <lb/>
            vehicle, or desires to go to some place speedily, takes posses- <note type="footnote">1 Ho as to render themselves incapable of engaging in bodily exer <lb/>

            sion of a horse, if he sees one anywhere, and, after making <lb/>
            proper use of it, restores it.</p>
          <p>4. Nor, in regard to the following point, did he allow that <lb/>
            that which is customary among other people should be prac­ <lb/>
            tised among his countrymen. For when men, from being <lb/>
            overtaken by night in hunting, are in want of provisions, <lb/>
            unless they have previously furnished themselves with them, <lb/>
            he directed that, in such a case, those who have partaken of <lb/>
            what they need, leave the rest ready for use, and that those <lb/>
            who require a supply, having opened the seals,1 and taken as <lb/>
            much as they want, seal the remainder up again and leave it. <lb/>
            As they share thus, then, with one another, those who possess <lb/>
            but little participate, whenever they are in need, in all the <lb/>
            produce of the country.</p>

          <p>Restrictions on the employments of the Lacedæmonians.</p>
          <p>1. THE following practices, too, Lycurgus established in <lb/>
            Sparta, at variance with those of the rest of Greece. In <lb/>
            other communities all gain as much by traffic as they can; one <lb/>
            cultivates land, another trades by sea, another engages in <lb/>
            general commerce, another maintains himself by art. 2. But <lb/>
            at Sparta, Lycurgus prohibited free men from having any <lb/>
            connexion with traffic, and enjoined them to consider as their <lb/>
            only occupation whatever secures freedom to states.2 3. How, <lb/>
            indeed, could wealth be eagerly sought in a community where <note type="footnote"> 1 Weiske may well observe that " too much brevity has rendered this <lb/>
            passage obscure." But it appears that the Lacedæmonians had cellars <lb/>
            or storehouses for provisions in their grounds ; that the doors, or other <lb/>
            apertures in them, were sealed; and that such as were in distress for <lb/>
            food, like the hunters in the text, might break the seals, extract what <lb/>
            they required, and then seal up the openings again with the iron seal­ <lb/>
            rings which they wore. See Sauppe's note; Muller's Dorians, ii. 191 <lb/>

            he had appointed that the citizens should contribute equally <lb/>
            to their necessary maintenance, and should take their meals <lb/>
            in common, and had thus provided that they should not desire <lb/>
            wealth with a view to sensual gratifications ? Nor had they, <lb/>
            moreover, to get money for the sake of clothing; for they <lb/>
            think themselves adorned, not by expensive raiment, but by <lb/>
            a healthy personal appearance. 4. Nor have they to gather <lb/>
            money for the purpose of spending it on those who eat with <lb/>
            them, since he has made it more honourable for a person to <lb/>
            serve his neighbours by bodily exertion, than by putting him­ <lb/>
            self to pecuniary expense ; making it apparent that the one <lb/>
            proceeds from the mind, and the other from fortune.</p>
          <p>5. From acquiring money by unjust means, he prohibited <lb/>
            them by such methods as the following. He instituted, in the <lb/>
            first place, such a kind of money, that, even if but ten mince <lb/>
            came into a house, it could never escape the notice either of <lb/>
            masters or of servants ; for it would require much room, and <lb/>
            a carriage to convey it. 6. In the next place, gold and silver <lb/>
            are searched after, and, if they are discovered anywhere, the <lb/>
            possessor of them is punished. How, then, could gain by <lb/>
            traffic be an object of pursuit, in a state where the possession <lb/>
            of money occasions more pain than the use of it affords pleasure ?</p>

          <p>Obedience to the magistrates and laws.</p>
          <p>1. THAT at Sparta the citizens pay the strictest obedience <lb/>
            to the magistrates and laws, we all know. I suppose, however, that Lycurgus did not attempt to establish such an excellent order of things, until he had brought the most power­ <lb/>
            ful men in the state to be of the same mind with regard to it. <lb/>
            2. I form my opinion on this consideration, that, in other <lb/>
            states, the more influential men are not willing even to appear <lb/>
            to fear the magistrates, but think that such fear is unbecoming <lb/>
            free men ; but in Sparta, the most powerful men not only put <lb/>
            themselves under the magistrates, but even count it an honour <pb n="217"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="§ 3-5.] "/>to humble themselves before them, and to obey, when they <lb/>
            are called upon, not walking, but running; supposing that if <lb/>
            they themselves are the first to pay exact obedience, others <lb/>
            will follow their example; and such has been the case. 3. It is <lb/>
            probable, also, that the chief men established the magistracy of <lb/>
            the Ephori, in conjunction with Lycurgus, as they must have <lb/>
            been certain that obedience is of the greatest benefit, alike in <lb/>
            a state, and in an army, and in a family; and they doubtless <lb/>
            considered that the greater power magistrates have, the great­ <lb/>
            er effect will they produce on the citizens in enforcing obedi­ <lb/>
            ence.1 4. The Ephori, accordingly, have full power to im­ <lb/>
            pose a fine on whomsoever they please, and to exact the fine <lb/>
            without delay; they have power also to degrade magistrates <lb/>
            even while they are in office, and to put them in prison, and <lb/>
            to bring them to trial for their life. Being possessed of such <lb/>
            authority, they do not, like the magistrates in other states, <lb/>
            always permit those who are elected to offices to rule during <lb/>
            the whole year as they choose, but, like despots and presidents in gymnastic contests, punish on the instant whomsoever <lb/>
            they find acting at all contrary to the laws.</p>
          <p>5. Though there were many other excellent contrivances <lb/>
            adopted by Lycurgus, to induce the citizens to obey the laws, <lb/>
            the most excellent of all appears to me to be, that he did not <lb/>
            deliver his laws to the people until he bad gone, in company <lb/>
            . with the most eminent of his fellow-citizens, to Delphi, and <lb/>
            consulted the god whether it would be more beneficial and <lb/>
            advantageous for Sparta to obey the laws which he had <lb/>
            made. As the god replied that it would be more beneficial <lb/>
            in every way, he at once delivered them, deciding that it <lb/>
            would be not only illegal, but impious, to disobey laws sanc­ <lb/>
            tioned by the oracle. <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Καταπλήξειν τοὺς πολίτας του̃ ὑπακούειν</foreign>.] The construction is not <lb/>
            very clear. Morus understands <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕνεκα</foreign> before <foreign xml:lang="grc">του̃ ὑπακούειν</foreign>. 'E7ri seems <lb/>
            preferable. Schneider thinks those two words spurious, and to be ejected. <lb/>

          <p>Infamy and penalties of cowardice.</p>
          <p>l. IT is deserving of admiration, too, in Lycurgus, that he <lb/>
            made it a settled principle in the community, that an honour­ <lb/>
            able death is preferable to a dishonourable life; for whoever <lb/>
            pays attention to the subject will find that fewer of those who <lb/>
            hold this opinion die, than of those who attempt to escape <lb/>
            danger by flight. 2. Hence we may say with truth, that <lb/>
            safety attends for a much longer period on valour than on <lb/>
            cowardice; for valour is not only attended with less anxiety and <lb/>
            greater pleasure, but is also more capable of assisting and sup­ <lb/>
            porting us. It is evident, too, that good report accompanies <lb/>
            valour ; for almost everybody is willing to be in alliance with <lb/>
            the brave.</p>
          <p>3. How he contrived that such sentiments should be enter­ <lb/>
            tained, it is proper not to omit to mention. He evidently, <lb/>
            then, intended a happy life for the brave, and a miserable one <lb/>
            for the cowardly. 4. In other communities, when a man acts <lb/>
            as a coward, he merely brings on himself the name of coward, <lb/>
            but the coward goes to the same market, and sits or takes <lb/>
            exercise, if he pleases, in the same place with the brave man ; <lb/>
            at Lacedæmon, however, every one would be ashamed to ad­ <lb/>
            mit a coward into the same tent with him, or to allow him to <lb/>
            be his opponent in a match at wrestling. Frequently, too, a <lb/>
            person of such a character, when they choose opposite parties <lb/>
            to play at ball, is left without any place; and in forming a <lb/>
            chorus he is thrust into the least honourable position. On <lb/>
            the road he must yield the way to others, and at public meet­ <lb/>
            ings he must rise up, even before his juniors. His female <lb/>
            relatives1 he must maintain at hornet and they must pay the <lb/>
            penalty of his want of spirit ;3 he is also not allowed to have <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τὰς προσηκούαςκόϱας</foreign>.] Not only daughters, but other female re­ <lb/>
            ' lations, whom he might happen to have under his protection; else the <lb/>

            anointed,2 or imitate the manners of persons of blameless <lb/>
            character ; else he will have to receive stripes from his betters. <lb/>
            Since, then, such disgrace is inflicted on cowards, I do not at <lb/>
            all wonder that death is preferred at Sparta to a life so dishonourable and infamous.</p>

          <p>Honours paid to old age. Encouragement of virtue.</p>
          <p>1. LYCURGUS seems to me to have provided also, with great <lb/>
            judgment, how virtue might be practised even to old age; for <lb/>
            by adding to his other enactments the choice of senators3 at <lb/>
            an advanced stage of life, he caused honour and virtue not to <lb/>
            be disregarded even in old age.</p>
          <p>2. It is worthy of admiration in him, too, that he attached <lb/>
            consideration to the old age of the well-deserving; for by <lb/>
            making the old men arbiters in the contest for superiority in <lb/>
            mental qualifications, he rendered their old age more honour­ <lb/>
            able than the vigour of those in the meridian of life. 3. This <note type="footnote"> pides means more than once a girl that finds no husband. But this, as <lb/>
            Sauppe observes, is incompatible with <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἰτίαν ὑπέχειν</foreign>, which can mean <lb/>
            nothing else but subire culpam. Camerarius and some others read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀναν­ <lb/>

            to them by Sauppe. As he is a citizen, he is under obligation to marry ; <lb/>
            but being unable to obtain a wife through infamia for cowardice, he has <lb/>
            to pay a penalty for living unmarried. Z<foreign xml:lang="grc">ημία</foreign>, says Schneider, seems to <lb/>
            mean a pecuniary fine. Dindorf omits the <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ</foreign>, making the passage signify <lb/>
            that the coward must have his hearth without a wife, as he will be unable <lb/>
            to get one. But the of is found in all copies, and Sauppe's explanation <lb/>
            is very satisfactory. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 He is not allowed to walk about through the city and the fields anointed with oil. The use of ointments was permitted in war, but the coward <lb/>

            contest is deservedly held in the greatest esteem among the <lb/>
            people, for gymnastic contests are attended with honour, but <lb/>
            they concern only bodily accomplishments ; the contest for dis­ <lb/>
            tinction in old age involves a decision respecting merits of the <lb/>
            mind. In proportion, therefore, as the mind is superior to the <lb/>
            body, so much are contests for mental eminence more worthy of <lb/>
            regard than those concerning bodily superiority.</p>
          <p>4. Is it not highly worthy of admiration, also, in Lycurgus, <lb/>
            that when he saw that those who are disinclined1 to practise <lb/>
            virtue are not qualified to increase the power of their country, <lb/>
            he obliged all the citizens of Sparta to cultivate every kind of <lb/>
            virtue publicly. As private individuals, accordingly, who <lb/>
            practise virtue, are superior in it to those who neglect it, so <lb/>
            Sparta is naturally superior in virtue to all other states, as it <lb/>
            is the only one that engages in a public cultivation of honour <lb/>
            and virtue. 5. Is it not also deserving of commendation, <lb/>
            that, when other states punish any person that injures another, <lb/>
            Lycurgus inflicted no less punishment on any one that openly <lb/>
            showed himself regardless of becoming as good a man as possible ? 6. He thought, as it appears, that by those who make <lb/>
            others slaves, or rob them, or steal anything, the individual <lb/>
            sufferers only are injured, but that by the unprincipled and <lb/>
            cowardly whole communities are betrayed ; so that he appears <lb/>
            to me to have justly imposed the heaviest penalties on such <lb/>
            characters.</p>
          <p>7. He also imposed on his countrymen an obligation, from <lb/>
            which there is no exception, of practising every kind of political virtue ; for he made the privileges of citizenship equally <lb/>
            available to all those who observed what was enjoined by the <lb/>
            laws, without taking any account either of weakness of body <lb/>
            or scantiness of means; but if any one was too indolent to <lb/>
            perform what the laws prescribed, Lycurgus appointed that <lb/>
            he should be no longer counted in the number of equally privileged citizens.</p>
          <p>8. That these laws are extremely ancient is certain; for <lb/>
            Lycurgus is said to have lived in the time of the Heracleidæ;2 <lb/>
            but, ancient as they are, they are still very new to other com- <note type="footnote">1 I read oi <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴ βουλόμενοι</foreign>, with Leunclavius, Zeune, and Schneider. <lb/>

          <p>Of the Lacedæmonian army</p>
          <p>1. THE regulations which I have mentioned are beneficial <lb/>
            alike in peace and in war; but if any one wishes to learn <lb/>
            what he contrived better than other legislators with reference <lb/>
            to military proceedings, he may attend to the following particulars.</p>
          <p>2. In the first place, then, the Ephori give the cavalry and <lb/>
            infantry public notice of the years during which they must <lb/>
            join the army, as well as the artisans; for the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            provide themselves in the field with an abundance of all those <lb/>
            things which people use in a city; and of whatever instru­ <lb/>
            ments1 an army may require in common, orders are given to <lb/>
            bring some on waggons, and others on beasts of burden, as <lb/>
            by this arrangement anything left behind is least likely to <lb/>
            escape notice.</p>
          <p>3. For engagements in the field he made the following ar­ <lb/>
            rangements. He ordered that each soldier should have a <lb/>
            purple robe and a brazen shield; for he thought that such a <lb/>
            dress had least resemblance to that of women, and was excellently adapted for the field of battle, as it is soonest made <lb/>
            splendid, and is longest in growing soiled. He permitted also <lb/>
            those above the age of puberty to let their hair grow, as he <lb/>
            thought that they thus appeared taller, more manly, and more <lb/>
            terrible in the eyes of the enemy.</p>
          <p>4. When they were thus equipped, he divided them into <lb/>
            six morae of cavalry and heavy-armed infantry. Each of <note type="footnote"> 1 As axes, hand-mills, kneading-troughs, whetstones, &amp;c. Comp. Cyrop. <lb/>

            five hundred, and Polybius of nine hundred; Plutarch, Pelop. c. 17. The </note> <pb n="222"/>

            these moræ of the citizens1 has one polemarch, four centurions, <lb/>
            eight captains of fifty, and sixteen enomotarchs.2 The men <lb/>
            of these moræ are sometimes, according to the command issued, <lb/>
            formed in enomotiæ, sometimes by threes, sometimes by sixes.3 <lb/>
            5. As to what most people imagine, that the arrangement of <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians under arms is extremely complex, they <lb/>
            conceive the exact contrary to what is the fact; for in the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonian order the officers are placed in the front ranks, <lb/>
            and each rank is in a condition to perform everything which <lb/>
            it is necessary for it to perform.4 6. So easy is it to understand this arrangement, that no one, who can distinguish one <lb/>
            man from another, would fail of learning it; for it is assigned <lb/>
            to some to lead, and enjoined on others to follow. Shiftings <lb/>
            of place, by which the companies are extended or deepened, <lb/>
            are ordered by the word of the enomotarch, as by a herald; <lb/>
            and in these there is nothing in the least difficult to learn. <lb/>
            7. But how it is possible for men in this arrangement, even if <lb/>
            they are thrown into confusion, to fight with an enemy pre- <note type="footnote">text has " moræ of cavalry and infantry," but the mora appears to have <lb/>
            been only a battalion of foot. The writer of the article "Army" in <lb/>
            Smith's Diet. of Gr. and Rom. Antiquities says that to each mora of in­ <lb/>
            fantry there was attached a mora of cavalry, consisting at most of one <lb/>
            hundred men. But for this statement I have not discovered his authority. <lb/>
            Schneider thinks that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἱππε</foreign>ĩ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ς</foreign> was a political appellation for a body of men <lb/>
            that were not necessarily cavalry, and that are in this passage only said <lb/>

            fairly confesses that he does not understand these words. Weiske, with <lb/>
            Morus, would read <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάντα παρέχων</foreign>, omnia præstans, or faciens, making <lb/>
            the signification to be, that every man in each file imitates exactly what <lb/>
            the foremost man does ; but in opposition to this change of reading, it may <lb/>
            be asked why the participle should be active, and the infinitive middle ? <lb/>
            Leunclavius's version has, Et series quælibet habet omnia quibus repræsentatis opus est. Gail translates thus: " Et chaque file porte avec elk ce <lb/>
            qui lui est nécessaire.” </note> <pb n="223"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="§ 8-10.]"/> <lb/>
            senting themselves on any quarter alike, it is not so easy to <lb/>
            understand, except for those who have been brought up under <lb/>
            the institution of Lycurgus. 8. The Lacedæmonians do with <lb/>
            the greatest ease what appears extremely difficult to other <lb/>
            men that are even accustomed to arms. For when they march <lb/>
            in column, one enomotia follows in the rear of another ;1 and <lb/>
            if, when they are in this order, a body of the enemy shows <lb/>
            itself in front, orders are given to each enomotarch to bring <lb/>
            up his enomotia to the front on the left; and this movement <lb/>
            is made throughout the whole army, until it presents itself <lb/>
            in full array against the enemy. But if again, while they are <lb/>
            in this order, the enemy should show themselves in the rear, <lb/>
            each rank performs an evolution,2 that the strongest3 may <lb/>
            always be presented to the enemy.</p>
          <p>9. But when the commander is on the left, they do not <lb/>
            in that case consider themselves in a worse condition, but <lb/>
            sometimes even in a better; for if an enemy should attempt <lb/>
            to encompass them, he would come round, not on the defenceless, but on the armed side. If on any occasion, again, it <lb/>
            should appear advantageous, for any particular object, that <lb/>
            the commander should occupy the right wing, they wheel the <lb/>
            troop towards the wing, and manoeuvre4 the main body, until <lb/>
            the commander is on the right, and the rear becomes the left. <lb/>
            10. But if, again, a body of the enemy appear on the right, <lb/>
            marching in column, they do nothing else but turn each century round, like a ship, so as to front the enemy ; and thus <lb/>
            the century which was in the rear comes to the right. But <lb/>
            if the enemy approach on the left, they do not allow them to <lb/>
            come near, but repulse them, or turn their centuries round to <lb/>
            face the enemy; and thus again the century that was in the <lb/>
            rear takes its place on the left. <note type="footnote"> 1 Kar' <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐϱὰν δήπου ἐνωμιοτία ἕπεται</foreign>.] A tergo manipularia series <lb/>

          <p>1. I WILL also explain how Lycurgus directed that a camp <lb/>
            should be pitched. As the angles of a quadrilateral figure <lb/>
            are useless, he formed the encampment in a circle, unless <lb/>
            there happened to be a mountain to protect it, or unless the <lb/>
            troops kept a wall or a river behind them. 2. He appointed <lb/>
            guards during the day, some close by the camp, looking into <lb/>
            it;1 for these are stationed with reference, not to the ene­ <lb/>
            my, but to their own friends:2 as for the enemy, cavalry <lb/>
            watch their approach from posts from which they command <lb/>
            the farthest view. 3. If any went out of the camp3 at night, <lb/>
            he directed that they should be watched by the Sciritæ;4 a <lb/>
            duty which is now performed by the mercenary troops, [if] <lb/>
            any of them [happen]5 to be with the army. As to their <lb/>
            custom of always going about with spears,6 we may know for <lb/>
            certain that it is observed for the same reason for which they <lb/>
            always prohibit slaves from entering the army. That those <note type="footnote"> ' <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τὰς μὲν παϱὰ τὰ ὅπλα εἴσω βλεπούσας</foreign>.] Most copies have <foreign xml:lang="grc">πϱὸς</foreign> <lb/>

            All guards are posted as well with a view to the enemy as to their friends; <lb/>
            they are posted to secure their friends from being surprised by the enemy. <lb/>
            Gail renders the words, " Ce n'est pas centre l’ennemi qu'elles sont <lb/>

            them in the camp, as a defence against the slaves, who were far superior <lb/>
            to them in numbers, and whom they could thus more easily suppress in case <lb/>
            of any disturbance arising among them. Weiske. Schneider refers tc <lb/>

            who retire on necessary occasions do not withdraw farther <lb/>

            as will not cause each other uneasiness, must not excite sur­ <lb/>
            prise in us; for they observe such caution for self-preserva­ <lb/>
            tion.</p>
          <p>5. They change the position of their camp frequently, with <lb/>
            the view both of doing damage to their enemies and of serving <lb/>
            their friends. It is prescribed by law that all the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians are to practise gymnastic exercises whenever they <lb/>
            are in the field;1 and they thus acquire a finer appearance <lb/>
            than they had before, and a more manly air than other men. <lb/>
            But the space for walking or running must be made not less, <lb/>
            land not much greater,]2 than the space over which a mora <lb/>
            would extend,3 in order that no one may go far away from <lb/>
            his arms. 6. When the exercises are concluded, the first <lb/>
            polemarch gives orders for them to sit down; this serves the <lb/>
            purpose of a review; he then orders them to take their break­ <lb/>
            fast, and soon after to relieve the advanced sentinel.4 The <lb/>
            men then amuse themselves and take rest previously to the <lb/>
            evening exercises. 8. After these, orders are issued that they <lb/>
            may take supper, and that, when they have sung a hymn to <lb/>
            the gods, from whom they have had favourable omens when <lb/>
            sacrificing, they may repose themselves on their arms.</p>
          <p>That I specify many particulars, no one ought to be sur­ <lb/>
            prised ; for an observer will find very few things that require <lb/>

          <p>Of the authority and duties of the king in the field. Of the Spartan war­ <lb/>
            fare in general.</p>
          <p>1. I WILL also relate what power and honour Lycurgus has <lb/>
            assigned to the king when he is with the army. In the first <lb/>
            place, the state supports the king on an expedition, and those <lb/>
            who attend on him; and the polemarchs pitch their tents <lb/>
            close by him, that, being always at hand, they may be the bet­ <lb/>
            ter able to take counsel with him, if they require to do so. <lb/>
            Three others, also, of the equally privileged citizens pitch <lb/>
            their tents with him; and these attend to all the provisions <lb/>
            for the rest,1 that no business of that kind may prevent them <lb/>
            from attending to military affairs.</p>
          <p>2. But I will go back to describe how the king sets forth <lb/>
            with the army. He first sacrifices, while still at home, to <lb/>
            Jupiter and the gods with him,2 and if the omens there be <lb/>
            favourable, the fire-bearer,3 taking fire from the altar, leads <lb/>
            the way to the confines of the country, when the king again <lb/>
            sacrifices4 to Jupiter and Minerva. 3. When favourable <lb/>
            omens have been obtained from both these deities, he then <lb/>
            crosses the boundaries of the country; and the fire from these <lb/>
            sacrifices is carried before him, never being extinguished, and <lb/>
            all kinds of victims5 are taken with him. But whenever <lb/>
            sacrifice is offered., he always commences that duty before <lb/>
            daybreak, wishing to be the earliest to gain the good­ <lb/>
            will6 of the god.7 4. There are present at the sacrifice, the <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τούτοι̃ς</foreign>] Regi et suis. Dativus est commodi.

            polemarchs, the centurions, the captains of fifties, the officers <lb/>
            of the mercenaries, the captains of the baggage-troop, and any <lb/>
            one of the military commanders from the towns1 that chooses. <lb/>
            5. There are present, also, two of the ephori, who, however, <lb/>
            take no active part in the proceedings, unless the king calls <lb/>
            upon them; but, as they observe what every one does, they <lb/>
            render the whole company, as is to be expected, more solemn <lb/>
            in their deportment. When the sacrifice is concluded, the <lb/>
            king, calling all the officers around him, gives directions as to <lb/>
            what is to be done ;2 so that, if you watched all these proceed­ <lb/>
            ings attentively, you would think that other nations engaged <lb/>
            in military operations without premeditation, and that the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians were the only people really skilled in the con­ <lb/>
            duct of war.</p>
          <p>6. If, when the king commences his march, no enemy ap­ <lb/>
            pears, no one goes before him except the Sciritæ and the <lb/>
            cavalry ordered to reconnoitre ; but if they expect that a battle <lb/>
            will ensue, the king, taking the foremost troop3 of the first <lb/>
            mora, and wheeling it round, leads it off to the right, until he <lb/>
            reaches the space between two morse and two polemarchs.4 <lb/>
            7. Those who are to be stationed next to these, the eldest of <lb/>
            the attendants on the royal tent5 draws up ; and these are <lb/>
            such of the equally privileged citizens as pitch their tents to­ <lb/>
            gether, as well as the augurs, the physicians, the officers of <lb/>
            the army,6 and the volunteers, if there be any. Thus no part <lb/>
            of what is necessary to be done is attended with any difficulty; <lb/>
            for everything has been previously considered.</p>
          <p>8. The following particulars, too, as it appears to me, <lb/>
            Lycurgus ordered with great advantage in regard to contests <lb/>
            in arms. When a goat is sacrificed,7 the enemy being in <lb/>
            sight, it is the custom that all the flute-players who are in <lb/>

            arms be made bright. It is expected of the youth to engage <lb/>

            and fair appearance. 9. They also call out the orders to the <lb/>

            each enomotia from each enomotarch at the extremity; but to <lb/>
            see that all is properly done is the business of the polemarch. <lb/>
            10. As to the time when it may seem proper to pitch the camp, <lb/>
            the king has the direction, as well as the power of pointing <lb/>
            out the place where it must be pitched.</p>
          <p>To the king it also belongs to send embassies, either to <lb/>
            friends or enemies. Every one, indeed, when he wishes to do <lb/>
            anything of consequence, begins by consulting the king. 11. If <lb/>
            any one comes seeking justice, the king refers him to the <lb/>
            Hellanodicæ;2 if money, to the paymasters; if he brings in <lb/>
            spoil, to the sellers of the spoil. Things being thus ordered, <lb/>
            no other duty is left for the king in the field, than to act as <lb/>
            priest in what regards the gods, and as general in what con­ <lb/>

          <p>Departure from the discipline of Lycurgus.</p>
          <p>1. 3 [IF any one should ask me, whether the laws of Lycur­ <lb/>
            gus appear to me to continue even at the present time intact, <lb/>
            I could certainly no longer reply with confidence in the af­ <lb/>
            firmative. 2. For I know that the Lacedæmonians formerly <lb/>
            preferred to associate together at home, though with moderate <lb/>
            means, rather than to grow corrupt by governing foreign <lb/>
            cities, and listening to flatterers. 3. I know that they were <lb/>
            formerly afraid to let it be known that they were possessed of <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τψ̃ νέῳ κεκτενισμένῳ</foreign>.] This is Schneider’s emendation. Dindorf <lb/>

            gold; but some at present, I am aware are ostentatious of <lb/>
            possessing it. 4. 1 know that for this reason strangers were <lb/>
            formerly banished from Sparta, and that citizens were not <lb/>
            allowed to reside abroad, lest they should be initiated in licen­ <lb/>
            tiousness by foreigners; but now I know, that those who are <lb/>
            thought the chief men among them have shown the utmost <lb/>
            eagerness to be constantly engaged in governing some foreign <lb/>
            city. 5. There was a time, too, when they made it their <lb/>
            study to render themselves worthy to be governors; but now <lb/>
            they use far more exertion to obtain rule, than to prove them­ <lb/>
            selves deserving of it. 6. Hence the Greeks formerly used to <lb/>
            resort to Lacedæmon, and request them to be their leaders <lb/>
            against those who were convicted of doing wrong ; but now <lb/>
            many of the Greeks exhort one another to prevent them from <lb/>
            ever again taking the lead. 7. Yet we must not feel surprised <lb/>
            that such reproach is thrown upon them, since they evidently <lb/>
            show themselves neither obedient to the deity,1 nor to the <lb/>
            laws of Lycurgus.]</p>

          <p>Compact between the kings and the people.</p>
          <p>1. I WISH, also, to state what compact Lycurgus instituted <lb/>
            between the king and the state; for this is the only govern­ <lb/>
            ment that continues just as it was established at the very be­ <lb/>
            ginning; other constitutions we may find either changed, or <lb/>
            at present undergoing change.</p>
          <p>2. Lycurgus, then, appointed that the king should offer all <lb/>
            the public sacrifices on behalf of the state, as being descended <lb/>
            from Jupiter, and that he should command the army wherever <lb/>
            the state should think proper to send it. 3. He allowed the <lb/>
            king also to receive an honorary portion of the sacrifices offer­ <lb/>
            ed, and appointed him choice portions of land in the territory <lb/>
            of many of the neighbouring towns, of such an extent that he <lb/>
            might neither be in want of moderate means, nor be possessed <lb/>
            of extravagant wealth. 4. That the kings might take their <note type="footnote"> I Apollo, who is often called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ ϑεὸς</foreign> Kar' <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξοχήν</foreign>, as in c. 8, § 5. Weiske. </note> <pb n="230"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[§ 5-9."/> <lb/>
            meals1 in a tent away from home, too, he assigned them a <lb/>
            public tent, and honoured them with a double portion at din­ <lb/>
            ner, not that they might eat twice as much as others, but that <lb/>
            they might have it in their power to honour whomsoever they <lb/>
            pleased with a part of it. 5. He permitted also each of <lb/>
            the kings to choose for himself two tent-companions, whom <lb/>
            they call Pythii.2 He allowed the king, too, to take a pig <lb/>
            from the brood of every sow, that he might never be in want <lb/>
            of victims, if it should be necessary for him to consult the <lb/>
            gods. 6. Near the palace, a lake affords abundance of water; <lb/>
            and that such a supply is useful for many purposes, those who <lb/>
            are without it know extremely well. All rise up from their <lb/>
            seats before the king, except the ephori from their seats of <lb/>
            office. 7. They take an oath to each other every month, the <lb/>
            ephori for the state, and the king for himself. The oath on <lb/>
            the part of the king is, that he will govern according to the <lb/>
            existing laws of the state ; the oath on the part of the state is, <lb/>
            that if the king adheres to his word, they will preserve his <lb/>
            kingdom unshaken.</p>
          <p>8. Such are the honours that are granted to the king in his <lb/>
            native land, while living, honours not far exceeding those that <lb/>
            are paid to private individuals; for Lycurgus did not wish to <lb/>
            excite a tyrannical spirit in the kings, or to inspire the citi­ <lb/>
            zens with envy of their power. 9. As to the honours which <lb/>
            are paid to a king when dead, the laws of Lycurgus wish to <lb/>
            show by them that they have honoured the kings of the La­ <lb/>
            cedæmonians, not as men, but as heroes. <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἔξω σκηνοι̃εν</foreign>.] Publico convictu utantur, non domi cum familiâ <lb/>

            10—12. Some indolence and corruption among the Athenians, 13. Little <lb/>
            favour shown by them to the higher order of the people among their allies, <lb/>

            Athens, 16—18. Their nautical skill, 19, 20.</p>
          <p>1. As to the government of the Athenians,l I do not com­ <lb/>
            mend them for having chosen that form of government, for <lb/>
            this reason, that, by making such a choice, they chose that <lb/>
            the lower class should be in a better condition than the upper ; <lb/>
            for this reason, then, I say, I do not commend them; but I <lb/>
            will show that, since this state of things has been adopted by <lb/>
            them, they support their constitution well, and successfully <lb/>
            transact other things in which they appear to the rest of the <lb/>
            Greeks to be in error.</p>
          <p>2. I shall observe, then, in the first place, that in such a con­ <lb/>
            stitution the poor and the plebeian have deservedly greater in­ <lb/>
            fluence than the well-born and the rich; because it is the <lb/>
            plebeians that manage the shipping, and that in consequence <lb/>
            increase the power of the state ; for the pilots and celeustæ,2 <note type="footnote">1 Sauppe supposes that the abrupt beginning of this treatise indicates <lb/>
            that it has been detached from some large work on the merits of the vari­ <lb/>
            ous forms of government in Greece. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 A kind of naval fugle-men, to whose voice and signals the rowers <lb/>

            and capta.ns of fifty rowers, and forecastle-men,l and ship­ <lb/>
            builders, are those who add strength to the community far <lb/>
            more than the noble and better class of citizens. Since such <lb/>
            is the case, therefore, it seems to be but just that all of them <lb/>
            should have a voice concerning the offices of state, whether the <lb/>
            election to them be by lot. or by show of hands, and that every <lb/>
            one of the citizens who wishes should have liberty to speak.</p>
          <p>3. In those offices, however, which, from being efficiently or - <lb/>
            inefficiently held, cause safety or peril to the whole common­ <lb/>
            wealth, the people have no desire to participate ; they do not <lb/>
            expect to be admitted to the office of commander-in-chief or <lb/>
            of general of the cavalry; for they are sensible that they are <lb/>
            more benefited by not taking upon themselves such offices, but <lb/>
            allowing the most influential2 of the citizens to hold them ; <lb/>
            but whatever posts are held for pay,3 or attended with benefit <lb/>
            to their families, these the people try to gain.</p>
          <p>4. In the very fact, too, at which some wonder, that they <lb/>
            everywhere give more weight to the less respectable, the poor, <lb/>
            and the plebeians, than to those of a higher class, they will <lb/>
            but prove that they uphold their democratic form of govern­ <lb/>
            ment ; for if the humble, the men of the people, and the lower <lb/>
            orders prosper and increase in number, they add to the po­ <lb/>
            pular power ; but if the wealthier and higher classes are ad­ <lb/>
            vanced in prosperity, the plebeians establish in authority a <lb/>
            party opposed to themselves. 5. In every country, indeed, <lb/>
            the better class of the people is adverse to a democracy ; for <lb/>
            in the most respectable portion of a community there is the <lb/>
            least licentiousness and injustice, and the strictest regard to <lb/>
            honesty ; but among the plebeians the greatest ignorance, in­ <lb/>
            subordination, and vice ; for poverty leads them much more <lb/>
            to dishonourable practices, and to some men want of instruc­ <lb/>
            tion and knowledge, in consequence of the want of money. ..4 <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πρωρα̃ται</foreign>.] Men who stood on the look-out at the prow, and made <lb/>

            have allowed all men without distinction to speak in public, <lb/>
            and offer advice, but only those of the greatest ability and of <lb/>
            the highest character ; but even in this respect they act with <lb/>
            excellent judgment, by permitting even the mean to speak ; for <lb/>
            if the highest class only made speeches and offered their <lb/>
            opinions, what they say might be of advantage to men like <lb/>
            themselves, but of no advantage to the plebeians ; but now, <lb/>
            even the lowest individual of the people, standing up to speak <lb/>
            if he pleases, can bring to light something that may be bene­ <lb/>
            ficial both to himself and to his equals. 7. Some one might <lb/>
            ask, " What measure can such a man devise that is likely to be <lb/>
            beneficial either to himself or to the people ? " but the Atheni­ <lb/>
            ans know that his imperfect knowledge and humble views, if <lb/>
            attended with benevolence, are more likely to profit the com­ <lb/>
            munity than the talents and wisdom of the higher character, if <lb/>
            accompanied with dishonest intentions.</p>
          <p>8. Under such modes of proceeding the constitution may <lb/>
            not be the very best, but the democratic form of government <lb/>
            will thus be excellently preserved ; for the people are by no <lb/>
            means desirous, while the state is well regulated, to be them­ <lb/>
            selves slaves, but to be free and to govern. If the govern­ <lb/>
            ment is bad, they care but little ; for, from that which you <lb/>
            think a bad condition of government, the people gain both <lb/>
            strength and freedom. 9. But if you want a really good <lb/>
            government, you must first see the wisest men make laws for <lb/>
            the people ; and then the good must punish the bad, and con­ <lb/>
            sult for the interests of the commonwealth, and not allow fellows <lb/>
            like madmen 1 to offer counsel, and harangue and address the <lb/>
            public assemblies. In such an excellent state of things, how­ <lb/>
            ever, the plebeians would soon fall into servitude.</p>
          <p>10. The licence allowed to slaves and sojourners at Athens <lb/>
            is very great ; it is not allowable to strike them, nor will the <lb/>
            slave yield you the way. For what reason this custom is <note type="footnote">text. Leunclavius and Zeune would insert <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔνεστι</foreign>, or something similar, <lb/>
            which Weiske thinks may be understood. Sauppe has thrust into his <lb/>

            of education is a cause of stupidity in men), but the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνέωσις</foreign> wants <lb/>
            authority. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μαινομένονς</foreign>.] " We must understand furiosis similes," says Schnei­ <lb/>

            it were usual for the slave, or the sojourner, or the freed <lb/>
            man to be beaten by the free citizen, he would often strike <lb/>
            an Athenian born, imagining him to be a slave ; for the <lb/>
            people of the city wear no better dress than slaves or so­ <lb/>
            journers, nor are they at all superior in personal appear <lb/>
            ance. 11. Yet if any one feels surprised that they permit <lb/>
            their slaves to fare luxuriously, and some of them to live even <lb/>
            magnificently, they may be shown to act even in this respect <lb/>
            with judgment; for where a naval power exists, it is neces­ <lb/>
            sary, from pecuniary considerations, to humour the slaves,1 <lb/>
            that we may receive the profit from the work which they per­ <lb/>
            form,2 and to indulge them in a liberal way of living ;3 <lb/>
            but where the slaves are rich, it is no longer expedient that <lb/>
            my slave should fear you; (at Lacedæmon, indeed, my slave <lb/>
            fears you ;) since, if your slave fears me, he will be likely to <lb/>
            sacrifice what is in his possession,4 in order to escape danger <lb/>
            to his person. t2. On this account, accordingly, we have <lb/>
            granted to slaves a certain equality 5 with the free, as well as <lb/>
            to sojourners with the citizens ; for the state has need of so­ <lb/>
            journers, through the great number of trades, and for the ser­ <lb/>

            rich furnish the expense for the choruses, while the lower <lb/>
            class of people enjoy the pleasure of them, but that the rich <lb/>
            also supply triremes, and preside over the gymnasia, while the <lb/>
            poor have the benefit of both ; the plebeians are accordingly <lb/>
            ready to take money for singing, and running, and dancing, <lb/>
            and serving in the galleys, that they themselves may have <lb/>
            some advantage, and that the rich may become poorer.1</p>
          <p>14. As to proceedings in courts of law, they have less re­ <lb/>
            gard to what is just, than to what is profitable to themselves.</p>
          <p>As to their allies, those who are sent from Athens over the <lb/>
            sea to them calumniate the more respectable class, as it appears, <lb/>
            and manifest dislike for them, knowing that the governors <lb/>
            must necessarily be hated by the governed ; and if ever, in­ <lb/>
            deed, the rich and influential secure power in the states, <lb/>
            the government of the people of Athens will be but of very <lb/>
            short duration. On these accounts, accordingly, they degrade <lb/>
            the better sort of people, take away their property, banish <lb/>
            them, and put them to death, but increase the influence of the <lb/>
            lower orders. The more honourable of the Athenians, how­ <lb/>
            ever, protect the respectable inhabitants in the allied states, <lb/>
            being aware that it is for their advantage always to support <lb/>
            the aristocracy in those communities.</p>
          <p>15. Some person might say, that it is a great support to the <lb/>
            Athenians that their allies should be in a condition to con­ <lb/>
            tribute money to them. To the plebeians, however, it seems <lb/>
            to be of much greater advantage that every individual of the <lb/>
            Athenians should get some of the property of the allies, and <lb/>
            that the allies themselves should have only so much as to en­ <lb/>
            able them to live and to till the ground,2 so that they may not <lb/>
            be in a condition to form conspiracies.</p>
          <p>16. The people of Athens seem also to have acted injudi­ <lb/>
            ciously in this respect, that they oblige their allies to make <lb/>
            voyages to Athens for the decision of their lawsuits. But <lb/>
            the Athenians consider only, on the other hand, what benefits <lb/>
            to the state of Athens are attendant on this practice ; in the <lb/>
            first place, they receive their dues throughout the year from <note type="footnote"> I "1<foreign xml:lang="grc">να</foreign>—<foreign xml:lang="grc">οἰ πλούσιοι πενέστεροι γίγνωνται</foreign>.] " Afin d’ameliorer soil <lb/>

            the prytaneia ;1 in the next place, they manage the govern­ <lb/>
            ment of the allied states while sitting at home, and without <lb/>
            sending out ships ; they also support suitors of the lower or­ <lb/>
            ders, and ruin those of an opposite character, in their courts <lb/>
            of law ; but if each state had its own courts, they would, as <lb/>
            being hostile to the Athenians, be the ruin of those who were <lb/>
            most favourable to the people of Athens. 17. In addition to <lb/>
            these advantages, the Athenian people have the following pro­ <lb/>
            fits from the courts of justice for the allies being at Athens ; <lb/>
            first of all, the duty of the hundredth2 on what is landed at <lb/>
            the Peiræeus affords a greater revenue to the city ; next, who­ <lb/>
            ever has a lodging-house makes more money by it, as well <lb/>
            as whoever has cattle or slaves for hire; and the heralds, too, <lb/>
            are benefited by the visits of the allies to the city. is. Be­ <lb/>
            sides, if the allies did not come to Athens for law, they would <lb/>
            honour only such of the Athenians as were sent over the sea <lb/>
            to them, as generals, and captains of vessels, and ambassa­ <lb/>
            dors ; but now every individual of the allies is obliged to flat­ <lb/>
            ter the people of Athens, knowing that on going to Athens he <lb/>
            must gain or lose his cause according to the decision, not of <lb/>
            other judges, but of the people,3 as is the law of Athens; <lb/>
            and he is compelled, too, to use supplication before the court, <lb/>
            and, as any one of the people enters, to take him by the hand. <lb/>
            By these means the allies are in consequence rendered much <lb/>
            more the slaves of the Athenian people.</p>
          <p>19. Moreover, from the possessions which they hold, and <lb/>
            the governments which they administer, beyond the borders <lb/>
            of their country, the Athenians themselves and their followers <lb/>
            learn almost imperceptibly to row; for a man who is often at <lb/>
            sea must himself, as well as his attendants, take the oar in <lb/>
            hand ; and he will necessarily learn also the names of every­ <lb/>
            thing used in the management of vessels. 20. They become <lb/>

          <p>State of the Athenian land forces; advantages which they enjoy from <lb/>
            having the command of the sea, § 1—8. Institutions and regulations for <lb/>
            the advantage of the people ; other benefits from their naval power, 9—16. <lb/>
            Ease with which treaties are violated or set aside under a democracy, 17. <lb/>
            The people allow those who are unpopular to be satirized on the stage <lb/>
            18—20.</p>
          <p>1. THEIR land forces,1 which appear to be by no means in <lb/>
            good condition at Athens, may be thus characterized. They <lb/>
            consider themselves to be weaker in this department, and to <lb/>
            have fewer troops, than their enemies ; but they are superior <lb/>
            by land to their allies, who pay them tribute ; and they think <lb/>
            that their land force, if they maintain by its aid a superiority <lb/>
            over their allies, is sufficient.</p>
          <p>2. From fortune, too, they have some such advantage as <lb/>
            the following. It would be possible for their subjects, if they <lb/>
            dwelt on the mainland, to collect themselves together from <lb/>
            small towns, and take the field in a large body; but as to <lb/>
            those who are ruled by sea, such as islanders, it is impossible <lb/>
            for their towns to unite their strength; for the sea lies. be­ <lb/>
            tween them, and their rulers are masters of the sea; and if it <lb/>
            were practicable for the islanders to come together secretly <lb/>
            into one island, they would perish of famine. 3. Whatever <lb/>
            cities, moreover, are subject to the Athenians on the continent, <lb/>
            the larger of them are kept in subordination through fear, <lb/>
            and the smaller through necessity ; for there is no city that <lb/>
            does not require to import or export commodities; and this <lb/>
            will be out of its power, unless it be obedient to those who <lb/>
            have the mastery at sea. 4. It is possible, also, for the mas. <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ὁπλιτικόν</foreign>.] By this word is here meant land forces in general, as <lb/>
            opposed to naval forces. Of the first section of this chapter the text <lb/>
            is in a very unsatisfactory state, and is given differently in different editions. <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[CH. 2"/> <lb/>
            ters of the sea to do what is impracticable to those who are <lb/>
            masters of the land only ; for instance, to ravage at times the <lb/>
            lands even of the more powerful; since they can make a de­ <lb/>
            scent on the coast, where there are either no enemies or but <lb/>
            few, and, if a for?e come against them, can reëmbark and sail <lb/>
            away ; and those who do this find fewer difficulties than those <lb/>
            who make attacks with a land army.</p>
          <p>5. Those who have the ascendency at sea, moreover, can <lb/>
            sail as far from their own country as they please ; while those <lb/>
            who rule on land can march but a very few days' journey <lb/>
            from home; for marches are slow, and it is impossible for <lb/>
            those who go by land to carry provisions sufficient for any <lb/>
            considerable length of time. He that goes by land, too, must <lb/>
            either go through a friendly country, or make his way by <lb/>
            fighting; but he who goes by sea may disembark wherever <lb/>
            he is stronger, and, when he is weaker, may sail along the <lb/>
            coast of the country until be reaches the territories either of a <lb/>
            friendly or of an inferior nation. 6. Those again who are power­ <lb/>
            ful by land cannot easily bear blights of the crops, which <lb/>
            proceed from Jupiter ; but the rulers of the sea can endure <lb/>
            them with ease ; for the whole of a country does not suffer <lb/>
            at the same time; so that provisions come to the rulers of the <lb/>
            sea from that ground which is in good condition.</p>
          <p>7. If we may allude, in addition, to some smaller advan­ <lb/>
            tages, the Athenians, through their intercourse with other na­ <lb/>
            tions, in consequence of their maritime ascendency, have dis­ <lb/>
            covered various sorts of luxuries; since whatever is attractive <lb/>
            in Sicily, or Italy, or Cyprus, or Egypt, or Lydia, or Pontus, <lb/>
            or the Peloponnesus, or anywhere else, may be collected into <lb/>
            one spot through enjoying the command of the sea. 8. Hear­ <lb/>
            ing all kinds of languages spoken, too, they have selected <lb/>
            different words from each. The rest of the Greeks have each <lb/>
            a peculiar language and mode of living and dress, but the <lb/>
            Athenians have adopted a mixture of fashions from Greeks <lb/>
            and barbarians.</p>
          <p>9. As to sacrifices, and temples, and festivals, and conse­ <lb/>
            crated groves, the people, knowing that it is impossible for <lb/>
            every poor man to make offerings and feasts, and have temples, <lb/>
            and to live in a beautiful and extensive city,1 have discovered <note type="footnote">1 That is, to secure for himself a fine large city, in which he may dwell <lb/>
            H3 can enjoy such accommodation only with the aid of the rich. </note> <pb n="239"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="§ 10—14.]"/> <lb/>
            by what means these privileges may be secured to them. <lb/>
            The state accordingly sacrifices many victims at the public <lb/>
            expense, while it is the people that feast on them, and distri­ <lb/>
            bute them among themselves by lot. 10. Some of the rich, <lb/>
            indeed, have private places of exercise, and baths, and un­ <lb/>
            dressing-rooms ; but the people construct for their own especial <lb/>
            use many wrestling-grounds, and dressing-places, and baths; <lb/>
            and the vulgar have more enjoyment from them than the few <lb/>
            and the wealthy.</p>
          <p>11. The Athenians are the only nation among Greeks and <lb/>
            barbarians that can secure wealth ; for if any state is rich in <lb/>
            timber for ship-building, where shall they dispose of it, unless <lb/>
            they gain the favour of the rulers of the sea ? Or if any <lb/>
            state abounds in iron, or brass, or flax, where shall they dis­ <lb/>
            pose of it, unless they obtain the consent of the lords of the <lb/>
            sea ? It is, however, from these very materials that our ships <lb/>
            are constructed ; for from one nation comes timber, from an­ <lb/>
            other iron, from another brass, from another hemp, from an­ <lb/>
            other wax. 12. Besides, such as are our rivals will not allow <lb/>
            people to carry these things to any other parts than where <lb/>
            they themselves command the sea.1 I, without labour, have <lb/>
            all these benefits from the land by means of the sea ; and no <lb/>
            other state has any two of these materials ; for the same state <lb/>
            has not timber and flax, since, where there is abundance of <lb/>
            flax, the ground is level and woodless ; nor do brass and iron <lb/>
            come from the same state ; nor are any two or three other <lb/>
            commodities found in the same state, but one state abounds in <lb/>
            one, and another in another.</p>
          <p>is. Besides, there is near every part of the mainland either <lb/>
            a projecting shore, or an island lying on the coast, or an <lb/>
            isthmus, so that those who have the command of the sea may <lb/>
            make a descent there, and do injury to the inhabitants of the <lb/>
            continent.</p>
          <p>14. But there is one particular in which they lie under a <lb/>
            disadvantage; for if the Athenians inhabited an island and <lb/>
            were lords of the sea, they would have it in their power to do <lb/>
            mischief to others if they pleased, and would suffer no injury <note type="footnote">1 Our rivals, if we do not secure the goods, will get possession of them; <lb/>
            they will not allow them to be dispersed about everywhere, but will seize <lb/>
            upon as large a portion of them for themselves as they can, since they want <lb/>
            them as well as we; but, as we are the stronger, we get the greater share. </note> <pb n="240"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[CH. 2."/> <lb/>
            from others, as long as they maintained their superiority at <lb/>
            sea; nor would their land be ravaged, nor would they fear <lb/>
            the approach of an enemy. But at present the husband­ <lb/>
            men, and the richer citizens in Athens, are greatly in fear <lb/>
            of enemies ; though the lower order, being well aware that an <lb/>
            enemy will burn or devastate nothing belonging to them, live <lb/>
            in security, and without any apprehension of an enemy. 15. <lb/>
            In addition to this, they would have been free from another <lb/>
            cause of fear, if they had inhabited an island; for they would <lb/>
            never have dreaded that their city might be betrayed, or their <lb/>
            gates set open, or an enemy let in upon them by a small <lb/>
            faction; (for how could such things have happened when they <lb/>
            dwelt in an island ?) nor, had they been islanders, would <lb/>
            they have had seditions among the people ; for if the people <lb/>
            were to raise a sedition at present, they would raise it from trust­ <lb/>
            ing in an enemy, with the expectation of bringing them into <lb/>
            the city by land ; but if they were all islanders, they would be <lb/>
            free from apprehension on that point. 16. Since, however, <lb/>
            they have not dwelt in an island from the beginning, their <lb/>
            practice now is to deposit their property in the islands, trust­ <lb/>
            ing to their power by sea, and allow the lands of Attica to be <lb/>
            ravaged.1 knowing that, if they concerned themselves for <lb/>
            their territory, they would lose other things of greater im­ <lb/>
            portance.</p>
          <p>17. It is necessary for states governed by an oligarchy to <lb/>
            pay strict adherence to alliances and treaties ; and if they do <lb/>
            not keep their engagements, by whom else can it be sup­ <lb/>
            posed that faith is broken, but by those who made those en­ <lb/>

            what was settled by no means pleased him ; they examine <lb/>

            not please them that the measure in question should be car­ <lb/>

            what they do not wish. And if any harm results from what <lb/>
            the people have decreed, they complain that a few individuals, <lb/>
            adverse to the popular interests, have mismanaged the mat­ <lb/>
            ter ; if any good is the consequence, they claim the credit to <lb/>
            themselves.</p>
          <p>is. The authorities do not allow jesting on the people in <lb/>
            comedies, or defaming them, lest they themselves be slan­ <lb/>
            dered ; but privately, if a writer wishes to satirize any <lb/>
            one, they stimulate him to the attempt, as they are sure that <lb/>
            he who is brought on the stage will in general not be one of <lb/>
            the multitude, but some rich, or noble, or influential person. <lb/>
            It is but a few of the poorer and plebeian class that are ever <lb/>
            exposed on the stage, and these would not be molested unless <lb/>
            for officiousness, and seeking to set themselves above the rest <lb/>
            of the people ; so that at the ridicule thrown on these they are <lb/>
            not at all concerned. 19. I say then, that the people at Athens <lb/>
            know very well which of the citizens are good and which are <lb/>
            bad; but, while they know this, they love those who are of <lb/>
            use and advantage to themselves, even though they be bad, <lb/>
            and rather entertain a dislike for the better sort, for they do <lb/>
            not think that the merit which is in them is for the good of <lb/>
            the people in general, but for their harm. On the other <lb/>
            hand, some, who belong to the people by birth, are by no <lb/>
            means of a democratic disposition.</p>
          <p>20. I forgive the people themselves their attachment to a <lb/>
            democracy, for it is pardonable in every one to study his own <lb/>
            benefit; but whoever is not one of the people, and prefers tc <lb/>
            live under a democratic rather than an oligarchic form of <lb/>
            government, is but meditating dishonesty, and knows that <lb/>
            it is much easier for a knave to escape notice under a de­ <lb/>

          <p>Why the allies find a difficulty in getting their suits decided at Athens, <lb/>
            1—9. The Athenians always favour the democratic party in other <lb/>
            states, 10, 11. No great danger to be apprehended from the resentment <lb/>
            of those who have been deprived of office at Athens, 12, 13.</p>
          <p>1. THE form of the Athenian government, then, I do not <lb/>
            commend; but since they have themselves given the prefer­ <lb/>
            ence to a democracy, they appear to me to preserve the de­ <lb/>
            mocratic constitution with ability, adhering to the modes of <lb/>
            proceeding which I have described.</p>
          <p>I see also that some blame the Athenians for this reason, <lb/>
            that it is sometimes impossible for an individual, after wait­ <lb/>
            ing even a whole year, to settle business with either the <lb/>
            senate or the people. This delay at Athens, however, arises <lb/>
            from no other cause than that, from the multiplicity of their <lb/>
            affairs, they are unable to decide matters with all parties, and <lb/>
            send them away; 2. for how could they do so, when they have to. <lb/>
            celebrate, in the first place, more festivals than any other city <lb/>
            of Greece,1 (and during these it is impossible for any one to <lb/>
            settle any part of the business of the state,) and have besides <lb/>
            to take cognizance of so many lawsuits, and accusations, and <lb/>
            examinations of public accounts, that not even all the men in <lb/>
            the world could attend to them; while the senate has to <lb/>
            deliberate frequently about war, frequently about obtaining <lb/>
            money, frequently about making laws, frequently about oc­ <lb/>
            currences from time to time in the city, and frequently about <lb/>
            affairs among the allies; and they must also receive payments <lb/>
            of tribute, and attend to the state of the dockyards and the <lb/>
            temples. Is it then at all wonderful that, when they have so <lb/>
            much business to transact, they cannot readily dispatch the <lb/>
            business of every individual ?</p>
          <p>3. Yet some say that if a suitor applies to the senate orthe <lb/>
            people with money in his hand, he will get his business done. <note type="footnote"> I Weiske refers to Aristoph. Vesp. 661, where Bdelycleon reckons the <lb/>
            Attic year as consisting of ten months, the other two months being con­ <lb/>
            sumed in festivals. Sauppe observes, that in Plato's Alcib. ii. c. 19, a <lb/>
            similar testimony is given to the vast number of the Athenian, festivals, on <lb/>
            wnich it is said that they have spent more money than all the other <lb/>
            Greeks together </note> <pb n="243"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="§ 4-6.]"/> <lb/>
            I am ready to grant, then, that much is done at Athens with <lb/>
            the aid of money, and that still more would be done if a <lb/>
            greater number offered money; yet I am certain that the <lb/>
            state is incapable of dispatching all the business of those who <lb/>
            require attention, however much gold and silver any one <lb/>
            might give them. 4. Besides, they must also give sentence <lb/>
            in cases when any one fails 1 to equip a vessel, or occupies <lb/>
            any public ground with building;2 and in addition to all <lb/>
            these affairs, they must decide between the choragi for the <lb/>
            Dionysia, the Thargelia, the Panathenæa, and the Hephæsteia,3 <lb/>
            every year. Four hundred trierarchs are also appointed <lb/>
            every year, and the people must every year settle causes for <lb/>
            such of these as require their judgment; and they must like­ <lb/>
            wise examine and decide about qualifications for offices, inquire <lb/>
            into the condition of orphans, and appoint keepers of prisoners, <lb/>
            all which things must be done every year. 5. From time to <lb/>
            time, too, they must give sentence in cases respecting military <lb/>
            affairs,4 as well as when any sudden offence is committed, or <lb/>
            when persons are guilty of any extraordinary outrage, or of <lb/>
            any impiety. I omit a great number of other matters, but <lb/>
            the most important have been mentioned, except the settle­ <lb/>
            ment of tribute, which is made in general every fifth year. <lb/>
            Do you not think, then, let me ask you, that they must give <lb/>
            careful judgment in all these particulars?</p>
          <p>6. Some one may say that it is not necessary to settle every­ <lb/>
            thing at once. But if he admits that they must settle every­ <lb/>
            thing, he must surely allow that they must settle it in the <lb/>
            course of the year. But in the present state of things 5 they <note type="footnote"> ' That is, any trierarch who has to equip a trireme at his own expense. <lb/>

            Suppose, then, somebody were to observe that they must in­ <lb/>
            deed give judgment, but, that the judges might sit in smaller <lb/>
            bodies. It will then be necessary, if they make several courts <lb/>
            of justice, that there be but few judges in each court; and it <lb/>
            will thus be comparatively easy to intrigue 1 with a small num­ <lb/>
            ber of judges, and to bribe them all to decide with much less <lb/>
            regard to justice. 8. In addition, we must consider that the <lb/>
            Athenians have to celebrate festivals, during which they can­ <lb/>
            not try causes in the courts. They keep twice as many feasts <lb/>
            as any other people keep; but I am supposing theirs equal to <lb/>
            those of the people who keep the fewest;2 and such, then, be­ <lb/>
            ing the case, I deny it to be possible that affairs at Athens can <lb/>
            proceed otherwise than at present, except that they may set <lb/>
            aside one thing, and introduce another, by little and little; <lb/>
            but to make any great alteration is impossible, without tak­ <lb/>
            ing something from the influence of the democracy. 9. It <lb/>
            would be possible to devise numbers of plans by which their <lb/>
            state might be placed in a better condition ; but to discover <lb/>
            how their democratic form of government is to continue, and <lb/>
            to determine satisfactorily how they may manage their civil <lb/>
            affairs better, except, as I just now said, by gradually adding <lb/>
            or taking away, is not easy.</p>
          <p>10. The Athenians are also thought to show a want of po­ <lb/>
            licy in this respect, that, in states which are divided into <lb/>
            parties, they favour that of the lower orders. But it is, in <lb/>
            reality, with judgment that they act thus; for if they favour­ <lb/>
            ed the better class, they would favour those who are not of <lb/>
            the same political sentiments with themselves, since in no <lb/>

            that are friendly, as like is always inclined to like. Accord­ <lb/>
            ingly, the Athenians hold to the party that is well disposed <lb/>
            towards themselves.</p>
          <p>11. Whenever, indeed, they have attempted to support the <lb/>
            aristocracy, the attempt has not been of advantage to them, <lb/>
            but within a very short time the plebeians have been reduced <lb/>
            to slavery. This happened in the case of the Bœotians ; 1 and <lb/>
            also when they took the side of the aristocracy among the <lb/>
            Milesians, who very soon afterwards revolted from the <lb/>
            Athenians, and massacred the plebeians;2 and the result was <lb/>
            similar when they took the side of the Lacedæmoniaus against <lb/>
            the Messenians,3 for the Lacedæmonians, within a very short <lb/>

          <p>1. I AM always of opinion that of whatever character <lb/>
            governors are, of a similar character also are the governments <lb/>
            which they conduct. But as some of those who rule at Athens <lb/>
            have been said to know what is just, no less than other men, but <lb/>
            have declared that they are compelled, through the poverty <lb/>
            of the common people, to act with somewhat of injustice to­ <lb/>
            wards the allied cities,1 I have in consequence set myself to <lb/>
            consider whether the citizens may by any means be main­ <lb/>

            it is most just that they should be maintained, thinking that, <lb/>

            seasons in it are extremely mild, the products of the soil tes­ <lb/>
            tify ; for such as will not even grow in many countries bear <lb/>
            fruit in perfection in Attica. And as the land is most pro­ <lb/>
            ductive, so likewise is the sea that surrounds the land; and <lb/>
            whatever fruits the gods afford in their several seasons begin <lb/>
            in this country earliest, and cease latest. 4. Nor is the land <lb/>
            superior only in things that grow up and decay annually, but <lb/>
            has also permanent advantages ; for stone is supplied from it in <lb/>
            abundance, from which the most magnificent temples, the most <lb/>
            beautiful altars, and the finest statues of the gods are made, and <lb/>
            in which many both Greeks and barbarians desire to partici­ <lb/>
            pate. 5. There are indeed portions of the soil which, though <lb/>
            sown, will not produce fruit, but which, if they are penetrated <lb/>
            by digging, will support many more people than if they pro­ <lb/>
            duced corn, as, doubtless by divine dispensation, they contain <lb/>
            silver beneath the surface ; and though there are many states <lb/>
            lying near, both by land and by sea, not even the smallest <lb/>
            vein of silver is found to extend into any one of them. 6. A <lb/>
            person might not unreasonably suppose that the state is situ­ <lb/>
            ate in the centre, not only of Greece, but of the whole in­ <lb/>
            habited world; for the further people are from it, the more <lb/>
            severe cold or heat do they experience ; and whatever travel­ <lb/>
            lers would pass from one end of Greece to the other, must all <lb/>
            either sail by Athens, or pass it by land, as the centre of their <lb/>
            circled 7. Though it is not surrounded by water, it never­ <lb/>
            theless attracts to itself like an island, with the aid of every <lb/>
            wind, whatever it requires, and sends away whatever it de­ <lb/>
            sires to export; for it has sea on each side of it. By land, <lb/>
            too, it receives many kinds of merchandise, as it is joined to <lb/>
            the continent. 8. To many states, moreover, barbarians who <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ὣσπερκύκλουτόρνον</foreign>.] Tó<foreign xml:lang="grc">ρνος</foreign>, according to Hesychius, means " an <lb/>

            pencil at the end of a string. But Weiske very properly observes that <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τόρνος</foreign>must here mean what is fixed in the centre, a stick or thread being <lb/>
            moved round it to describe the circumference; and Schneider agrees with <lb/>

          <p>Of the possibility of attracting a greater number of foreigners to sojourn at <lb/>
            Athens.</p>
          <p>1. OF all these advantages, I think that the land is itself, <lb/>
            as I said, the cause; and if to the blessings bestowed by na­ <lb/>
            ture there be joined, in the first place, an attention to the in­ <lb/>
            terests of strangers sojourning in it, (for that source of <lb/>
            revenue appears to me to be one of the best, since strangers, <lb/>
            while they maintain themselves, and confer great benefits on <lb/>
            the states in which they live, receive no pension from the <lb/>
            public, but pay the tax imposed on aliens,)2 such attention <lb/>
            would seem to me likely to be of the utmost benefit; 2. espe­ <lb/>
            dally if we relieve them at the same time from such imposi­ <lb/>
            tions as, while they are of no benefit to the state, appear to <lb/>
            cast on them a mark of dishonour, and if we exempt them <lb/>
            likewise from taking the field as heavy-armed infantry along <lb/>
            with the citizens; for the danger which they incur is great, <lb/>
            and it is a great trouble to them to be away from their <lb/>
            trades and families. 3. The state would also be much more <lb/>
            benefited, if the citizens stood by the side of one another in <lb/>
            the field, than if, as is the case at present, Lydians, and Syri­ <lb/>
            ans, and Phrygians, and other barbarians from every nation be <lb/>
            amalgamated with them. 4. In addition, too, to the good at­ <lb/>
            tendant on the exemption of strangers from joining the army. <lb/>
            it would be an honour to the country for the Athenians to be <lb/>
            seen to trust to themselves in the field of battle rather than to <lb/>
            foreigners. 5. While we give a share, moreover, to foreigners <note type="footnote"> • 1 States that border on Attica, lying between it and the barbarians, are <lb/>
            at a great distance from them; and Attica itself, and its capital Athens, <lb/>

            of other privileges which it is proper to share with them, we <lb/>
            should be likely in my opinion, if we gave them admission also <lb/>

            sides, as there are within the walls many pieces of ground 2 <lb/>
            for building, vacant of houses, I think that if the state were to <lb/>
            allow them to become the property of those who might build <lb/>
            upon them, and who, on applying for them, might seem to be <lb/>
            deserving, a greater number of respectable persons would by <lb/>
            that means become desirous of a settlement at Athens. 7. If <lb/>
            we should institute an order of guardians of foreigners, also, <lb/>
            as we have one of guardians of orphans, and some honour <lb/>
            should be conferred on such of them as should bring in the <lb/>
            greatest number of foreigners, such a plan would make the <lb/>
            foreigners more contented under us, and, as is likely, all who <lb/>
            have no residence in any other city3 would eagerly seek a <lb/>
            settlement at Athens,4 and would thus increase the public <lb/>
            revenue.</p>

          <p>Of granting privileges to merchants, and the benefits to be expected from <lb/>
            increased traffic.</p>
          <p>1. IN proof that the city is extremely pleasant and lucrative <lb/>
            as a place of trade, I will mention the following particulars. <lb/>
            In the first place, it has the finest and safest harbours for <lb/>
            vessels, where navigators may moor and rest in case of a <lb/>
            storm. 2. In the next place, merchants, in most other cities, <note type="footnote">1 Foreigners were excluded from the cavalry. Comp. Hipparch. c. 9 <lb/>

            must barter one commodity for another ; for the inhabitants <lb/>
            use money that will not pass beyond the limits of the country ; <lb/>
            but at Athens, while there is abundance of goods, such as <lb/>
            people require, for exportation, still, if merchants do not wish <lb/>
            to barter, they may carry off an excellent freight by taking <lb/>
            away our silver, for wherever they dispose of it, they will <lb/>
            always gain more than its original value.</p>
          <p>3. If we should propose rewards, however, for the judges of <lb/>
            the tribunal of commerce,1 to be given to such as should decide <lb/>
            points of controversy with the greatest justice and expedition, <lb/>
            so that persons who wished to sail might not be detained, a <lb/>
            still larger number of people would by that means be brought <lb/>
            to trade with us, and with greater pleasure. 4. It would be <lb/>
            for our advantage and credit also, that such merchants and <lb/>
            shipowners as are found to benefit the state by bringing to it <lb/>
            vessels and merchandise of great account should be honoured <lb/>
            with seats of distinction on public occasions, and sometimes <lb/>
            invited to entertainments ; for, being treated with such re­ <lb/>
            spect, they would hasten to return to us, as to friends, for the <lb/>
            sake, not merely of gain, but of honour. 5. The more people <lb/>
            settled among us and visited us, the greater quantity of mer­ <lb/>
            chandise, it is evident, would be imported, exported,2 and sold, <lb/>
            and the more gain would be secured, and tribute received.</p>
          <p>6. To effect such augmentations of the revenue, it is not neces­ <lb/>
            sary for us to be at any cost but that of philanthropic ordi­ <lb/>
            nances and careful superintendence.</p>
          <p>For securing whatever other revenues seem likely to come <lb/>
            in to us, I know that there will be need of a fund. 7. Yet I <lb/>
            am not without hope that the citizens will readily contribute <lb/>
            for this purpose, when I reflect how much the state con­ <lb/>
            tributed at the period when it assisted the Arcadians under <lb/>
            the command of Lysistratus,3 and how much under that of <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τη̜̃ του̃ ἐμπορίουὐϱχη̜̃</foreign>.]The judges that composed this court seem <lb/>

            out at great expense, galleys which were built when it was <lb/>
            uncertain whether the result of the expedition would be for <lb/>
            better or for worse, though it was very certain that the con­ <lb/>
            tributors would never receive back what they had paid, or <lb/>
            even recover any portion of it. 9. But at present the citizens <lb/>
            can acquire no gains so creditable as those from what they <lb/>
            may contribute for this fund ; for to him whose contribution <lb/>
            shall be ten minæ, about the fifth part will return as interest <lb/>
            from the fleet, as he will receive three oboli a day ; 2 and to <lb/>
            him whose contribution shall be five minæ, there will be a <lb/>
            return of more than the third.3 10. The most of the Athen­ <lb/>
            ians, assuredly, will receive annually more than they have <lb/>
            contributed ; for those who contribute a mina will have an <lb/>
            income of almost two minae, and will have it in the city, being <lb/>
            an income, too, that appears the safest and most durable of <lb/>
            human things. 11. I think too, for my own part, that if the <lb/>
            benefactors to our state were to have their names enrolled for <lb/>
            transmission to posterity, many foreigners would give us their <lb/>
            contributions, as well as some whole cities, through a desire for <lb/>

            seems to me, likewise, proper to try whether it be possible for <lb/>

            vessels for conveying merchandise, and to let them out for <lb/>
            hire, upon persons giving security for them, as is the case with <lb/>
            other things belonging to the public ; for if this should appear <lb/>
            practicable, a large income might be derived from that source.</p>

          <p>Of the extent of silver mines in Attica, § 1—12. How they may be rendered <lb/>
            profitable to the state, 13—33. Replies to objections that may be made <lb/>
            to the plans proposed, 34—52.</p>
          <p>1. SHOULD our silver mines, too, be managed as they ought <lb/>
            to be, I consider that great profits might be drawn from them, <lb/>
            in addition to our other revenues. To those who do not <lb/>
            know their value, I should wish to make it known ; for, when <lb/>
            you know this, you will be the better enabled to form plans <lb/>
            for arrangements respecting them. 2. That they were wrought <lb/>
            in very ancient times is well known to all ; for assuredly no <lb/>
            one attempts to specify at what time they began to be formed <lb/>
            But though the earth containing silver has been so long dug and <lb/>
            cast up, consider how small a portion the heaps which have been <lb/>
            thrown out are of the hills that remain still in their natural <lb/>
            state, and that contain silver underneath them. 3. Nor does <pb n="254"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[CH. 4."/> <lb/>
            the space of ground that is dug for silver appear to be at all <lb/>
            diminished, but to be perpetually extended in a wider circuit; <lb/>
            and during the time that the greatest number of men were in <lb/>
            the mines, no one was ever in want of occupation, but there <lb/>
            was always more work than enough for the hands employed. <lb/>
            4. At the present time, too, no one of those who have slaves <lb/>
            in the mines is diminishing the number of them, but is indeed <lb/>
            continually adding to it as many as he can ; for when but few <lb/>
            are engaged in digging and searching, little treasure is found ; <lb/>
            but when many are employed, a far greater quantity of silver ore <lb/>
            is discovered ; so that in this occupation alone, of all those that <lb/>
            I know, no one envies those that extend their operations.1 <lb/>
            5. All persons that have farms would be able to say how <lb/>
            many yokes of oxen, and how many workmen, would be <lb/>
            sufficient for their land; and if they send into their fields <lb/>
            more than are necessary, they consider it a loss ; but in the <lb/>
            mining operations for silver, they say that all are constantly in <lb/>
            want of workmen. 6. For the consequence is not the same <lb/>
            in this case as it is when there are numbers of workers in <lb/>
            brass, and when, as articles made of brass then necessarily <lb/>
            become cheap,2 the workmen are ruined, nor is it the same <lb/>
            as when there are excessive numbers of blacksmiths ; or as <lb/>
            when there is abundance of corn and wine, and when, as the <lb/>
            fruits of the earth are cheap, agriculture becomes unprofitable, <lb/>
            so that many farmers, quitting their occupation of tilling the <lb/>
            ground, betake themselves to the employments of merchants, <lb/>
            or inn-keepers, or bankers ; but, in regard to the silver mines, <lb/>
            the more silver ore is found, and the more silver is extracted, <lb/>
            the greater is the number that devote themselves to mining. <lb/>
            7. Of furniture, when people have got enough of it for their <lb/>
            houses, they do not much care for buying additional supplies ; <lb/>

            an increase of it; and if people have a superabundance, <lb/>
            they hoard it, and are not less delighted with doing so than <lb/>
            with putting it to use. 8. When communities, too, are in <lb/>
            the most flourishing condition, people have very great use for <lb/>
            money; for the men are ready to be at expense for beautiful <lb/>
            arms, or fine horses, or magnificent houses or furniture ;1 and <lb/>
            the women are eager for expensive dresses and golden orna­ <lb/>
            ments. 9. When communities, on the other hand, are in <lb/>
            distress, whether from scarcity of corn or from the effects of <lb/>
            war, they are still more in want of money, as the land lies <lb/>
            uncultivated, both for purchasing provisions and for paying <lb/>
            auxiliary troops.</p>
          <p>10. If any one should say that gold is not less useful for <lb/>
            such purposes than silver, I do not dispute the truth of the <lb/>
            assertion; but I am aware at the same time that gold, if it <lb/>
            shows itself in great quantities, becomes much less valuable, <lb/>
            and renders silver of a higher price. 11. These remarks I <lb/>
            have made with a view that we should send with confidence <lb/>
            as many workmen as possible into the silver mines, and should <lb/>
            with confidence continue our operations in them, fully trust­ <lb/>
            ing that the silver ore is not going to fail, and that silver will <lb/>
            never lose its value. 12. The state, however, appears tome <lb/>
            to have known this long before I knew it; for it allows any <lb/>
            foreigner that pleases to work in the mines, on paying the same <lb/>
            duty as the citizens.2</p>
          <p>13. But that I may make the subjects still more clear with <lb/>
            reference to the maintenance of the citizens, I will state how <lb/>
            the mines may be managed so as to be most beneficial to the <lb/>
            country. For what I am going to say, however, I do not <lb/>
            desire to court admiration, as if I had found out something <lb/>
            difficult to be discovered ; for part of what I shall state we <lb/>
            all at present see before us, and the condition of things in <lb/>
            times past, we hear, was of an exactly similar character. 14. <lb/>
            But we cannot but feel surprised that the state, when it sees <lb/>
            many private individuals enriching themselves from its re­ <lb/>
            sources, does not imitate their proceedings ; for we heard long <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κατασκευάς</foreign>.] Sturz very properly considers that this word here <lb/>

            ago, indeed, at least such of us as attended to these matters, that <lb/>
            Nicias the son of Niceratus kept a thousand men employed in <lb/>
            the silver mines, whom he let on hire to Sosias of Thrace, on <lb/>
            condition that he should give him for each an obolus a-day, free <lb/>
            of all charges ; and this number he always supplied undiminish­ <lb/>
            ed. Hipponicus also had six hundred slaves let out at the <lb/>
            same rate, which brought him in a clear mina a-day;1 Phile­ <lb/>
            monides had three hundred, which brought him half a mina; <lb/>
            and others had other complements of slaves, according, I sup­ <lb/>
            pose, to their respective resources. 16. But why should J <lb/>
            dwell upon former times, when there are numbers of men in <lb/>
            the mines let out in the same manner at present ? 17. And <lb/>
            if what I propose be carried into effect, the only new point in <lb/>
            it would be, that as private individuals, by the possession of <lb/>
            slaves, have secured themselves a constant revenue, so the <lb/>
            state should possess public slaves, to the number of three for <lb/>
            each Athenian citizen.2</p>
          <p>is. Whether what I propose is practicable, let him who <lb/>
            chooses, after considering every point of it, pronounce a judg­ <lb/>
            ment. As to the price for slaves, it is evident that the state <lb/>
            can procure it better than private individuals. It is easy <lb/>
            for the senate to issue a proclamation that he who will may <lb/>
            bring his slaves, and then to buy all that are brought. is. <lb/>
            When they are bought, why should not any person be as will­ <lb/>
            ing to hire slaves from the state as from a private individual, <lb/>
            if he is to have them on the same terms ? At least they hire <lb/>
            from the state consecrated grounds, and temples, and houses, <lb/>
            and farm the public taxes.3 20. That the slaves purchased <lb/>
            for the public may be kept safe, the state may require sureties <lb/>
            from those who hire them, as they require them from those who <lb/>
            farm the taxes ; and it is indeed much easier for him who farms <lb/>
            a tax to defraud the public than for him who hires slaves. 21. <lb/>
            For how can anyone identify the public money that is embez­ <lb/>
            zled, when private money is exactly like it; but as for slaves, <lb/>
            when they are marked with the public mark, and when a pen­ <lb/>
            alty is denounced against him who sells or exports them, how <note type="footnote"> 1 The mina being six hundred oboli. See note on c. 3, sect. 9. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 So that each Athenian citizen, says Weiske, might hire three slaves <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="§ 22—25.]"/> <lb/>
            could any one steal them ? So far, therefore, it will appear <lb/>
            to be possible for the state to acquire and to preserve slaves.</p>
          <p>22. But if any one doubts whether, after a great number of <lb/>
            workmen have been procured, a great number1 of persons <lb/>
            will also present themselves to hire them, let him be of good <lb/>
            courage, reflecting that many of those who already possess <lb/>
            slaves will still hire those belonging to the public, (for there <lb/>
            is plenty of work to employ them), and that many of those <lb/>
            engaged in the works are growing old, while there are many <lb/>
            others, both Athenians and foreigners, who would neither be <lb/>
            able nor willing to engage in corporeal labour,, but who <lb/>
            would gladly gain a subsistence by applying their minds to <lb/>
            the superintendence of the business. 23. If at first, then, <lb/>
            a thousand two hundred slaves be collected, it is probable <lb/>
            that, with the income from that number a complement of not <lb/>
            less than six thousand might in five or six years be obtained; <lb/>
            and if, of this number, each brings in a clear obolus, the <lb/>
            profit will be sixty talents a year.2 24. If of those sixty <lb/>
            talents twenty be devoted to the purchase of more slaves, the <lb/>
            state will be at liberty to use the other forty for whatever <lb/>
            other purpose it may think proper ; and when the number <lb/>
            of ten thousand slaves is made up, the yearly revenue from <lb/>
            them will be a hundred talents.</p>
          <p>25. That the state will receive 3 even a far greater profit <lb/>
            than this, those will agree with me in thinking, who remem­ <lb/>
            ber, if there are any that still remember, how great a height <lb/>
            the income from the slaves reached before the occurrences at <lb/>
            Deceleia.4 The fact, also, that, though innumerable work­ <lb/>
            men have been perpetually employed in the mines, their pre- <note type="footnote">1 Schneider thinks that <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ</foreign> should be inserted before the second <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολλοὶ</foreign> <lb/>

            forced, to suit the absence of the negative. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Six thousand slaves will bring in six thousand oboli a day, and thus, <lb/>
            if we reckon three hundred and sixty days to the year, the annual income <lb/>

            which sum, divided by thirty-six thousand, the number of oboli in a <lb/>

            sent condition is not at all different from that in which our <lb/>
            forefathers remember them to have been, affords me additional <lb/>
            support for this supposition. 26. Indeed, all that is now done <lb/>
            in the mines testifies that there can never be a greater num­ <lb/>
            ber of slaves there than the works require; for those who are <lb/>
            employed in digging find no limit to the depth or ramifications <lb/>
            of their works. 27. To cut in a new direction is assuredly <lb/>
            not less practicable now than it was formerly; nor can any <lb/>
            one say, from certain knowledge, whether there is more silver <lb/>
            ore in the parts which have been opened than is to be found <lb/>
            in those which are undisturbed. 28. Why then, some one <lb/>
            may ask, do not many make new cuttings now, as of old ? It <lb/>
            is because those engaged about the mines are now poorer; <lb/>
            for it was but lately that they began to be wrought again ; <lb/>
            and great risk is incurred by a person commencing new <lb/>
            operations; for he indeed that finds a profitable field of <lb/>
            labour becomes rich, but he who does not find one loses all <lb/>
            that he has expended ; and into such risk the men of the pre­ <lb/>
            sent day are by no means willing to run.</p>
          <p>so. I think, however, that I am able to give some ad­ <lb/>
            vice with regard to this difficulty also, and to show how <lb/>
            new operations may be conducted with the greatest safety. <lb/>
            There are ten tribes at Athens, and if to each of these the <lb/>
            state should assign an equal number of slaves, and the tribes <lb/>
            should all make new cuttings, sharing their fortune in com­ <lb/>
            mon, then, if but one tribe should make any useful discovery, <lb/>
            it would point out something profitable to the whole; 31. but <lb/>
            if two, or three, or four, or half the number should make <lb/>
            some discovery, it is plain that the works would be more <lb/>
            profitable in proportion ; and that they should all fail is con­ <lb/>
            trary to all the experience of past times. 32. It is possible <lb/>
            also for private individuals to unite and share their fortunes <lb/>
            together, and thus to venture with greater safety; and you <lb/>
            need entertain no apprehensions either that the public com­ <lb/>
            pany thus constituted will injure the private adventurers, or <lb/>
            that the private adventurers will inconvenience the public <lb/>
            company; but as allies in the field of battle, the greater the <lb/>
            number in which they meet, render one another proportion­ <lb/>
            ately stronger, so the greater the number that are employed <lb/>
            in the mines, the more gain will they acquire and bring to <lb/>
            the state. <pb n="259"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="§ 33—40."/> 33. I have now stated how I think that public matter <lb/>
            may be arranged, so that sufficient maintenance may be se­ <lb/>
            cured from our common resources for the whole body of the <lb/>
            Athenian people.</p>
          <p>34. If any of us, considering that there will be need of vast <lb/>
            funds for all these works, think that sufficient money will <lb/>
            never be contributed, let them not be cast down through that <lb/>
            apprehension. 35. For there is no necessity that all these <lb/>
            things should be done at once, or else no profit will result from <lb/>
            them; but whatever buildings are erected, or ships constructed, <lb/>
            or slaves purchased, the proceedings will straightway be at­ <lb/>
            tended with profit. 36. It is indeed more advantageous that <lb/>
            such things should be done gradually than that they should <lb/>
            all be done at once; for if we were to build all together, we <lb/>
            should do our work at greater cost and with less efficiency <lb/>
            than if we were to build by degrees; and if we were to get <lb/>
            a vast number of slaves at once, we should be compelled to <lb/>
            buy them in worse condition and at a higher price. 37. Pro­ <lb/>
            ceeding however according to our ability, we may continue <lb/>
            any operations that have been well planned, and if any error <lb/>
            has been committed, we may take care not to repeat it. 38. <lb/>
            Besides, if everything were to be done at once, it would be <lb/>
            necessary for us to procure means for everything at the same <lb/>
            time; but if part be done now, and part deferred, the incom­ <lb/>
            ing revenue may assist in obtaining what is necessary for <lb/>
            future proceedings.</p>
          <p>39. But as to that which appears to everybody most to be <lb/>
            apprehended, I mean that, if the state purchase an extraordi <lb/>
            nary number of slaves, the works may be overstocked, we <lb/>
            may feel quite free from that apprehension, if we do not send <lb/>
            into the mines every year a greater number than the opera <lb/>
            tions require. 40. Thus it appears to me that the way in <lb/>
            which it is easiest to pursue these plans is also that in which <lb/>
            it is best. But if, again, you think that, on account of the <lb/>
            contributions made during the present war, you are unable to <lb/>
            contribute anything further, you must, whatever sum of <lb/>
            money the taxes brought in before the peace, conduct the ad­ <lb/>
            ministration with that exact sum during the next year, and <lb/>
            whatever additional sum they may bring, through peace having <lb/>
            taken place, through attention being paid to the sojourners <lb/>
            and merchants, through mere commodities being imported <note type="footnote">s 2 </note> <pb n="260"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[CH. 4."/> <lb/>
            and exported in consequence of a greater number of people <lb/>
            resorting to us, and through the sale of goods being increased <lb/>
            at the harbour, you must take that sum and appropriate it in <lb/>
            such a way that the revenues may be advanced to the utmost. <lb/>
            41. If, however, any feel apprehensive that this course, if <lb/>
            war occur, will prove ineffectual, let them consider that, even <lb/>
            if war should break out, it will be far more formidable to <lb/>
            those who attack us than to our state. 42. For what acquisi­ <lb/>
            tion would be more useful for war than a great number of <lb/>
            people, since they would be able to man many of the public <lb/>
            vessels, while many of them also, serving for the public on <lb/>
            land, would offer a powerful resistance to the enemy, provided <lb/>
            that we do but treat them well ?</p>
          <p>43. I consider, too, that even if war takes place, it is possi­ <lb/>
            ble to prevent our mines from being abandoned ; for there is, <lb/>
            we know, a fortress near the mines at Anaphlystus, on the sea <lb/>
            towards the south, and another at Thoricus, on the sea toward? <lb/>
            the north ;1 and these two are distant from each other about <lb/>
            sixty furlongs. 44. If, then, a third fort should be built be­ <lb/>
            tween these on the summit of Besa, the workmen might then <lb/>
            retire into some one of all these fortresses, and, if they <lb/>
            should see an enemy approaching, it would be but a short <lb/>
            distance for each to retreat to a place of safety. 45. Should <lb/>
            even an overpowering number of enemies come, they would, <lb/>
            doubtless, if they found corn, or wine, or cattle, without the <lb/>
            works, carry them off; but if they even occupied the mining <lb/>
            ground, of what more would they possess themselves than a <lb/>
            heap of stones ? 46. But how, indeed, could our enemies ever <lb/>
            make an inroad on our mines ? for the city of Megara, which <lb/>
            is nearest to them, is distant much more than five hundred <lb/>
            stadia; and Thebes, which is the nearest city after Megara, <lb/>
            is distant much more than six hundred. 47. If they should <lb/>
            advance upon the mines, then, from any part in that direction, <lb/>
            they will be under the necessity of passing by the city of <lb/>
            Athens; and if they come in small numbers, it is probable <lb/>
            that they will be cut off by the cavalry and the guards of the <lb/>
            frontier ;2 while it is difficult to imagine that they will march <note type="footnote"> 1 Anaphlystus and Thoricus were two aemi of Attica, lying towards the <lb/>

            the city of Athens would be much nearer to their cities, than <lb/>

            even if they should come in great force, how could they stay, <lb/>
            when they would have no provisions? since, should they go <lb/>
            out to get. provisions in small parties, there would be danger <lb/>
            both to those who went out for provisions, and to those who <lb/>
            remained behind to fight;1 and, if their whole force went out <lb/>
            foraging on every occasion, they would be besieged rather <lb/>
            than besiegers.2</p>
          <p>49. Not only the profit from the slaves, then, would increase <lb/>
            the resources of the city, but, as a vast number of people <lb/>
            would collect about the mines, there would also arise a great <lb/>
            income from the market held there,3 from the rent of the <lb/>
            public buildings around the mines, from the furnaces, and from <lb/>
            all other sources of that kind. so. Our city, too, if it be thus <lb/>
            supported, will become extremely populous, and land about <lb/>
            the mines will grow as valuable to those who possess it there <lb/>
            as to those who have it around Athens. 51. Should all in­ <lb/>
            deed be done that I have proposed, I maintain that the state <lb/>
            will not only be better supplied with money, but will be more <lb/>
            quiet and orderly, and better prepared for war. 52. For those <lb/>
            who are appointed to exercise the youth would discharge <lb/>
            their duties in the gymnasia with greater care, as they would <lb/>

            gymnasiarchs for the torch-race ;4 and those who are sent to <lb/>

          <p>Necessity of peace for the maintenance and improvement of the revenue.</p>
          <p>1. BUT if it appears evident, that, if the full revenues from <lb/>
            the state are to be collected, there must be peace, is it not <lb/>
            proper for us also to appoint guardians of peace? 2 for such an <lb/>
            office, if established, would render the city more agreeable for <lb/>
            all men to visit, and more frequented. 2. Should any persons <lb/>
            imagine, however, that if our state continues to maintain <lb/>
            peace, it will be less powerful, and esteemed, and celebrated <lb/>
            through Greece, such persons, in my opinion, entertain an <lb/>
            unreasonable apprehension; for those states, assuredly, are <lb/>
            most prosperous, which have remained at peace for the long­ <lb/>
            est period ; and of all states Athens is the best adapted by <lb/>
            nature for flourishing during peace. 3. Who, indeed, if the <lb/>
            city were in the enjoyment of peace, would not be eager to <lb/>
            resort to it, and shipowners and merchants most of all ? <lb/>
            Would not those who have plenty of corn, and ordinary wine, <lb/>
            and wine of the sweetest kind, and olive oil, and cattle, flock <lb/>
            to us, as well as those who can make profit by their ingenuity <lb/>
            and by money-lending ?3 4. Where would artificers, too, <lb/>
            and sophists, and philosophers, and poets, and such as study <lb/>
            their works, and such as desire to witness sacrifices, or re­ <lb/>

            one can answer in the negative to these questions, and yet <lb/>
            some, who desire to recover the supreme dominion for our <lb/>
            state, think that that end would be effected better by war <lb/>
            than by peace, let them contemplate, first of all, the Persian <lb/>
            invasion, and consider whether it was by force of arms or by <lb/>
            good offices to the Greeks that we attained the head of the <lb/>
            naval confederacy, and the management of the treasury of <lb/>
            Greece.1 6. Besides, when our state, from being thought to <lb/>
            exercise its power too tyrannically, was deprived of its supre­ <lb/>
            macy, were we not then also, after we abstained from en­ <lb/>
            croachment, again made rulers of the fleet by the unanimous <lb/>
            consent of the islanders ? 2 7. Did not the Thebans, in con­ <lb/>
            sideration of the benefits which they had received, allow the <lb/>
            Athenians to lead them ?3 Even the Lacedæmonians, not from <lb/>
            being forced, but from having been assisted by us, allowed <lb/>
            the Athenians to settle matters as they pleased respecting the <lb/>
            supreme command.4 8. And at the present time, through the <lb/>
            disturbances prevailing in Greece,5 it seems to me that an <lb/>
            opportunity has offered itself to our city to attach the Greeks <lb/>
            to it again without difficulty, without danger, and without <lb/>
            expense ; for we may endeavour to reconcile the states that <lb/>
            are at war with one another, and we may try also to unite <lb/>
            such as are divided into factions. 9. If you should make it <lb/>
            evident, too, not by forming warlike confederacies, but by send­ <lb/>
            ing embassies throughout Greece, that you are anxious for the <lb/>
            temple at Delphi to be free as it was formerly, I think it would <lb/>
            not be at all surprising if you should find all the Greeks ready <lb/>
            to agree, and to form confederacies and alliances with you, <lb/>
            against those 6 who sought to gain the mastery over the Delphic <note type="footnote"> 1 The Athenians had the appointment of the Hellenotamiœ, the officers <lb/>

            moreover, that you are desirous that peace should prevail over <lb/>
            the whole land and sea, I consider that all the Greeks, next <lb/>
            to the security of their own countries, would pray for the pre­ <lb/>
            servation of Athens.</p>
          <p>11. But if any one still thinks that war is more conducive <lb/>
            to the wealth of our city than peace, I know not by what <lb/>
            means this point can be better decided, than by considering <lb/>
            what effect events that occurred in former times produced on <lb/>
            our city. 12. For he will find that in days of old vast sums <lb/>
            of money were brought into the city during peace, and that <lb/>
            the whole of it was expended during war; and he will learn, <lb/>
            if he gives his attention to the subject, that, in the present <lb/>
            day, many branches of the revenue are deficient in conse­ <lb/>
            quence of the war, and that the money from those which <lb/>
            have been productive has been spent on many urgent requi­ <lb/>
            sitions of every kind; but that now, when peace is established <lb/>
            at sea, the revenues are increasing, and that the citizens are <lb/>
            at liberty to make whatever use of them they please.</p>
          <p>13. If any one should ask me this question, "Do you mean <lb/>
            that, even if any power should unjustly attack our state, we <lb/>
            must maintain peace with that power ?" I should not say <lb/>
            that I had any such intention ; but I may safely assert, that <lb/>
            we shall retaliate on any aggressors with far greater facility, <lb/>
            if we can show that none of our people does wrong to any <lb/>
            ane;1 for then our enemies will not have a single supporter</p>

            their civil rights1 to the priests, the senate, the magistrates, <lb/>
            and the cavalry, is it not proper that we should proceed to ex­ <lb/>
            ecute these plans as soon as possible, that, even in our days, <lb/>
            we may see our country flourishing in security ? 2. Should <lb/>
            we resolve on pursuing these measures, I should recommend <lb/>
            that we should send to Dodona and Delphi to inquire of the <lb/>
            gods whether it will be better and more advantageous for the <lb/>
            state, for the present time and for posterity, thus to regulate <lb/>
            itself. 3. If the gods should give their assent to the pro­ <lb/>
            ceedings, I should say that we ought then to ask which of <lb/>
            the gods we should propitiate in order to execute our designs <lb/>
            in the best and most efficient manner; and whichever of the <lb/>
            deities they name in their reply, it will be proper to seek <lb/>
            favourable omens from them by sacrifices, and then to com­ <lb/>
            mence our operations ; for if our undertakings are begun with <lb/>
            the support of the gods, it is likely that the results from <lb/>
            them will lead continually to that which is still better and <lb/>
            more advantageous for the state. <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τὰ πάτϱια</foreign>.] " Leurs anciens droits." Gail. Sauppe supposes that <lb/>

          </head>
          <p>THIS treatise, as Weiske observes, is the production of a man <lb/>
            who had had much experience in horsemanship, and who had <lb/>
            nicely observed the habits and character of the horse. He speaks <lb/>
            with commendation, at the commencement, of a writer named <lb/>
            Simo, who had published a work on horses. Of Simo little more <lb/>
            is known than what Xenophon tells; he is called an Athenian by <lb/>
            Suidas (v. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τρίλλη</foreign>), and is several times cited by Pollux. Accord­ <lb/>
            ing to Pliny, H. N. xxxiv. 8, he was the first that wrote on horse­ <lb/>
            manship.</p>
          <p>In delivering his observations and precepts, Xenophon some­ <lb/>
            times uses the first person plural, and sometimes the first person <lb/>
            singular, but the reason for the difference does not appear. The <lb/>
            treatise seems from the conclusion to have been written after the <lb/>
            Hipparchicus, but as it is printed in all editions before it, it is here <lb/>
            suffered to retain its precedence.</p>

          <p>How a person may judge of a colt, so as not to be deceived in purchasing.</p>
          <p>1. SINCE, as it has been our fortune to be long engaged <lb/>
            about horses, we consider that we have acquired some know­ <lb/>
            ledge of horsemanship; we desire also to intimate to the younger <lb/>
            part of our friends how we think that they may bestow their <lb/>
            attention on horses to the best advantage. Simo has indeed <lb/>
            written, too, on the management of horses, who also made an of­ <lb/>
            fering of the brazen horse on the temple of the Eleusinian Ceres1 <lb/>
            at Athens, and engraved his own works 2 on the pedestal; <lb/>
            and in whatever particulars, assuredly, we happen to be of the <lb/>
            same opinion with him, we shall not expunge 3 them from our <lb/>
            pages, but shall lay them before our friends with far greater <lb/>
            pleasure, expecting to acquire additional credit, since he who <lb/>
            was skilled in horses had the same notions with us ; and on <lb/>
            such points as he has left unnoticed we shall endeavour to <lb/>
            throw light. <note type="footnote"> 1 To '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ελευσίνιον</foreign>.] Templum Cereris Eleusiniœ Athenis. See Pausan. <lb/>
            i. 4. Sturz, Lex. Xen. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τὰ ἑαυτυ̃ ἔργα</foreign>.] Weiske supposes that these words mean the arts <lb/>
            and contrivances which he adopted in the management of horses, and <lb/>
            which he indicated by the representation of a horse and man in certain <lb/>
            attitudes on the pedestal of the statue. This notion is supported by a <lb/>
            fragment of Hierocles, given in the collection of writings De Be Veteri­ <lb/>
            nariâ published by Simon Grynæus, Basil, 1537. Some have supposed <lb/>
            that Simo was himself a statuary, but this is not apparent. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Εξαλείψομεν</foreign>.] Xenophon speaks as if he had written his own book <lb/>

          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="[CH. 1."/> We shall show, first of all, how a man may be least deceived <lb/>
            in purchasing a horse. In regard to a colt not yet broken, it <lb/>
            is plain that we must examine his body ; for of his temper a <lb/>
            horse that has never been mounted can give no certain indi­ <lb/>
            cations.</p>
          <p>2. In respect to his body, then, we assert that we must first <lb/>
            examine the feet; for as there would be no use in a house, <lb/>
            though the upper parts were extremely beautiful, if the found­ <lb/>
            ations were not laid as they ought to be, so there would be no <lb/>
            profit in a war-horse, even if he had all his other parts excel­ <lb/>
            lent, but was unsound in the feet; for he would be unable to <lb/>
            render any of his other good qualities effective.</p>
          <p>3. A person may form his opinion of the feet by first ex­ <lb/>
            amining the hoofs ; for thick hoofs are much more conducive <lb/>
            to firmness of tread than thin ones ; and it must also not <lb/>
            escape his notice whether the hoofs are high or low, as well <lb/>
            before as behind ; for high hoofs raise what is called the frog 1 <lb/>
            far above the ground; and low ones tread equally on the <lb/>
            strongest and softest part of the foot, like in-kneed men. <lb/>
            'Simo says that horses which have good feet may be known by <lb/>
            the sound; and he says this with great justice, for a hollow <lb/>
            hoof rings against the ground like a cymbal.2</p>
          <p>4. Since we have commenced with this part, we shall as­ <lb/>
            cend from it to the rest of the body. The bones 3 immediately <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">Χελιδόνα</foreign>.] The soft and hollow part of the hoof, called also <foreign xml:lang="grc">βάτρα­ <lb/>

            Elemens Hippiatriques," reprehends this remark as trifling and false; <lb/>
            and if our author is to be understood literally-and the words seem to <lb/>
            admit no other construction-the criticism is certainly just. It may be <lb/>
            but candid, nevertheless, to think that Xenophon could mean to say no <lb/>
            more than that the feet, if well formed and in good condition, could bear <lb/>
            to be struck against the ground so forcibly as to make it ring and sound; <lb/>
            and that this noise was a proof of their soundness, otherwise the horse <lb/>
            could not bear the shock, so as to make his beats firm and distinct. Be­ <lb/>

            above the hoofs, then, and below the fetlocks, must be neither <lb/>
            too upright, like those of a goat (for then, being too unyield­ <lb/>
            ing,l they shake the rider, and such legs are more subject <lb/>
            to inflammation), nor ought those bones to be too sloping; <lb/>
            for the fetlocks will in that case be denuded of hair and <lb/>
            galled, if the horse be ridden either among clods or over <lb/>
            stones.</p>
          <p>5. Of the legs the bones ought to be thick ; for they are the <lb/>
            supports of the body ; but it is not in veins or flesh that their <lb/>
            thickness should consist,2 since, should this be the ca'se, they <lb/>
            must, when the horse is ridden over hard ground, be filled <lb/>
            with blood, when hard tumours3 will arise, and while the whole <lb/>
            leg is swollen, the skin will widen ; and when the skin is <lb/>
            loose, the small bone of the leg 4 often gives way, and renders <lb/>
            the horse lame.</p>
          <p>6. If the colt, as he walks, bends his knees freely,5 you <lb/>
            may conjecture that he will have supple legs when he is <lb/>
            ridden; for all colts in the course of time acquire greater <lb/>
            freedom of motion in their knees ; and supple joints are <lb/>
            justly commended, for they render a horse less likely to <lb/>
            stumble and grow tired than stiff joints.</p>
          <p>7. The thighs 6 under the shoulders, if they are stout, appear <lb/>
            stronger and more graceful, as is the case with those of men. <lb/>
            The chest, if somewhat broad, is better adapted both for beauty <lb/>
            and strength, as well as for keeping the legs, not so as to <lb/>
            touchy but wide apart.</p>
          <p>8. The neck, as it proceeds from the chest, should not fall <lb/>
            forwards, like that of a boar, but should grow upwards like <lb/>
            that of a cock, and should have an easy motion 8 at the parts <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Αντιτυπώτεϱα</foreign>.]Duriora atque nimis resistentia. Sturz, Lex.

            about the arch. The head should be bony,1 and have a small <lb/>
            cheek. Thus the neck will be directly in front of the rider,2 <lb/>
            and the eye of the animal will see what is before his feet.3 A <lb/>
            horse of such a shape would be less able to do mischief, even <lb/>
            though he be extremely vicious; for it is not by bending, but <lb/>
            by stretching out the neck and head, that horses attempt tt. <lb/>
            be mischievous.</p>
          <p>9. It is necessary to observe, however, whether both the <lb/>
            jaws4 be soft or hard, or only one of them, for horses which <lb/>
            have not both the jaws alike are generally obstinate.5 To <lb/>
            have the eye prominent gives an air of greater vigilance to a <lb/>
            horse than to have it sunk, and a horse with such an eye can <lb/>
            see much further than another.</p>
          <p>10. Wide nostrils are not only better adapted for breathing <lb/>
            than those which are contracted, but make a horse appear <lb/>
            more terrible; for when one horse is angry at another, or is <lb/>
            excited in being ridden, he dilates his nostrils.</p>
          <p>11. When the top of the head is somewhat large, and the ears <lb/>
            rather small, they render a horse's head more like what it <lb/>
            ought to be. The point of the shoulder being high renders <lb/>
            the seat of the rider more secure, and makes the shoulder ap­ <lb/>
            pear more firmly attached to the body. A double spine 6 is <lb/>
            both much softer to sit upon, and more pleasing to the eye, <lb/>
            than a single one. <note type="footnote"> 1 That is to say, the head should not be fleshy, but lean and dry; and <lb/>

            “ I have added the word bars, as explanatory of what Xenophon calls the <lb/>
            jaws, although it must be confessed that the good or bad temper of a <lb/>
            horse's mouth depends much upon the formation of the jaws, and the <lb/>

            give it a similar sense. " Pour l'ordinaire, ceux qui out les barres in6- <lb/>

            belly, render a horse in general more easy to ride, and stronger, <lb/>
            and make him appear better profited by his food.1 The <lb/>
            broader and shorter the loins are, the more easily the horse <lb/>
            raises his fore parts, and brings forward his hinder ones; and <lb/>
            in so doing, his belly will appear smaller, which, if large, partly <lb/>
            disfigures a horse, and renders him also weaker and less able <lb/>
            to carry weight.</p>
          <p>13. The haunches should be broad and well covered with <lb/>
            flesh, that they may correspond to the sides and the chest; <lb/>
            and if these parts are compact, they will be lighter for run­ <lb/>
            ning, and render the horse much swifter.</p>
          <p>14. If a horse has the thighs under the tail broad and not <lb/>
            distorted,2 he will then set his hind legs well apart, and will <lb/>
            by that means have a quicker3 and firmer step,4 a better seat <lb/>
            for a rider, and will be better in every respect.5 We may see <lb/>
            a proof of this in men ; for when they wish to take up anything <lb/>
            from the ground, they try to raise it by setting their legs <lb/>
            apart rather than by bringing them together.</p>
          <p>is. A horse should not have large testicles; but it is im­ <lb/>
            possible to tell what will be the size of them in a colt. With <lb/>
            regard to the pasterns of the hind legs, or shins, as well as the <lb/>
            fetlocks and hoofs, we may make the same remarks as we made <lb/>
            concerning the fore-legs. <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Εὐχιότερον</foreign>.] <foreign xml:lang="grc">Εὔχιλος</foreign>, qui pabulo facilè nutritur. Sturz, Lex. <lb/>

            least likely to be deceived in regard to the probable size; for <lb/>
            any colt that has very long legs when it is foaled will become <lb/>
            a very large horse, since in all quadrupeds the shank-bones <lb/>
            do not grow much as time advances, but the rest of the body, <lb/>
            that it may be symmetrical, grows in proportion to them.</p>
          <p>17. Those who judge in this way of the shape of a colt seem <lb/>
            to us most likely to get a horse that has good feet, and <lb/>
            is strong, fleshy, and of a good figure and size. Even <lb/>
            though some horses change as they grow up, yet we may still <lb/>
            have sufficient confidence in these observations to form a <lb/>
            judgment; for far more horses, from being ill-shaped, become <lb/>
            well proportioned, than grow deformed after having once been <lb/>
            well-shaped.</p>

          <p>Of breaking and training colts.</p>
          <p>1. How we must break colts, it does not appear to me that I <lb/>
            need give any account ;1 for though it is people that are well <lb/>
            provided with means in communities, and that have no small <lb/>
            share in the commonwealth, who are required 2 to serve in the <lb/>
            cavalry, yet it is much better for a young man to study to im­ <lb/>
            prove his bodily strength, and to attain a knowledge of horse­ <lb/>
            manship, or, if he is already a proficient in it, to exercise him­ <lb/>
            self in riding, than to be a breaker of colts ; and for a man in <lb/>
            years it is better that he should attend to his family and <lb/>
            friends, or to civil and military occupations, than employ him­ <lb/>
            self in training horses.</p>
          <p>2. He assuredly who knows as much as myself respecting <lb/>
            the management of colts will give his colt out to be broken.2 <note type="footnote"> 1 Dindorf follows Curerius in reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴ γραπτέον</foreign>. Preceding editions <lb/>

            But he ought to write down, when he gives him out, as he <lb/>
            does when he puts out a youth to learn any art, in what <lb/>
            points the trainer is to send him back instructed; for this will <lb/>
            be an intimation to the trainer to what particulars he must at­ <lb/>
            tend, if he wishes to receive his pay.</p>
          <p>3. We should however take care that the colt be delivered to <lb/>
            the breaker gentle, tractable, and submissive to man ; for such <lb/>
            a disposition may generally be produced in him by the groom <lb/>
            at home, if he knows how to manage so that hunger, and <lb/>
            thirst, and uneasiness may be felt by the colt when alone, and <lb/>
            that food, and drink, and relief from uneasiness may come to <lb/>
            him from man ; for, if things are thus ordered, men must not <lb/>
            only be liked, but longed for, by the colts.</p>
          <p>4. We ought also to handle such parts as a horse most <lb/>
            likes to be stroked; and these are the parts which are most <lb/>
            hairy, and in which the horse, if anything makes him uneasy, <lb/>
            is least able to afford himself relief.</p>
          <p>5. Let orders be given to the groom, too, to lead him <lb/>
            through crowds of people, and to make him approach all kinds <lb/>
            of objects and sounds; and of whichever of these the colt is <lb/>
            afraid, we must teach him, not with harshness, but with gen­ <lb/>
            tleness, that they are by no means objects of fear. Such are <lb/>
            the points, in respect to the breaking of colts, to which it ap­ <lb/>

          <p>How to judge of a horse for riding.</p>
          <p>1. WHEN a person would buy a horse that has been already <lb/>
            ridden, we shall subjoin some admonitions which he ought to <lb/>
            bear in mind, if he would not be cheated in his purchase. In <lb/>
            the first place, then, let it not escape his notice what the age <lb/>
            is; for a horse that has no longer the marks in his teeth <lb/>
            neither delights the buyer with hope, nor is so easy to be ex­ <lb/>
            changed.</p>
          <p>2. When his youth is ascertained, it must also be noticed <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τῳ̃ ἰδιώτῃ</foreign>.] That is one who is not a professed colt-breaker. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. III. </note> <note type="footnote"> T </note> <pb n="274"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[CH. 3"/> <lb/>
            how he takes the bit into his mouth, and the head-piece over <lb/>
            his ears; and this cannot fail to be observed, if the bridle is <lb/>
            put on in sight of the purchaser, and taken off in his sight.</p>
          <p>3. It is also necessary to see how he takes the rider on his <lb/>
            back ; for many horses reluctantly receive on them anything <lb/>
            which it is plain to them that they cannot receive without <lb/>
            oeing compelled to work. 4. It must likewise be observed <lb/>
            whether, when he is mounted, he wishes to separate himself <lb/>
            from other horses, or whether, if he is ridden near horses <lb/>
            standing by, he carries off his rider towards them. There <lb/>
            are some horses too, that, from bad training, run off from the <lb/>
            places of exercise to their stalls 1 at home.</p>
          <p>5. As for horses whose jaws are not alike,2 that sort of <lb/>
            riding which is called the pede exposes them, and, still more, <lb/>
            a change in the direction in which they are ridden; 4 for <lb/>
            many horses will not attempt to run away with their riders, <lb/>
            unless a hard jaw, and their course directed homewards, con­ <lb/>
            cur to stimulate them. We ought to ascertain, also, whether <lb/>
            the horse, being put to his speed, is readily pulled up, and <lb/>
            whether he submits to be turned about.</p>
          <p>6. It is good for a purchaser not to be ignorant,, moreover, <lb/>
            whether a horse is equally willing to obey when he is roused <lb/>
            with a blow; for a servant and an army, if disobedient, are <lb/>
            useless, but a disobedient horse is not only useless, but often <lb/>
            plays the traitor.</p>
          <p>7. But when we take upon ourselves to purchase a war- <lb/>
            horse, we must make trial of him in all things in which war <lb/>
            will make trial of him; and these are, leaping across ditches, <lb/>
            springing over walls, jumping on to mounds, and jumping <lb/>
            down from them ; and we must try him in riding up and down <note type="footnote">1 ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αφόδους</foreign>.] <foreign xml:lang="grc">̋Αφοδος</foreign>, says Sturz, is the same as <foreign xml:lang="grc">άναχώϱησις</foreign>, a re­ <lb/>

            meant, therefore, says Schneider, is the same as the Latin gyrus or gyrano. <lb/>
            Other critics have been much perplexed about the meaning of the word ; <lb/>
            put this seems to be the true interpretation. It is approved, says Sauppe, <lb/>
            by Hermann, in his Opusc. torn. i. p. 63—80. Yet the pede was not <lb/>
            always of a circular form. See c. 7, sect. 13. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Turning them sometimes to the right, sometimes to the left. This <lb/>

            sleep places, and along them; for all such efforts show his <lb/>
            spirit, whether it is bold, and whether his body is sound. 8. <lb/>
            Yet we must not at once reject a horse that does not accomplish <lb/>
            all these feats perfectly; for many fail, not from being un­ <lb/>
            able, but from want of training ; and if they are taught, and <lb/>
            used, and exercised in such performances, they will execute <lb/>
            them all well, provided they are sound in other respects, and <lb/>
            not wanting in spirit.</p>
          <p>9. We must however be cautious of having anything to do <lb/>
            with horses that are naturally shy; for horses that are exces­ <lb/>
            sively timorous will not only not allow the rider on their back <lb/>
            to harm the enemy, but will often take him by surprise, 1 and <lb/>
            expose him to great danger. 10. We must also learn whether <lb/>
            the horse has anything of vice either towards other horses, or <lb/>
            towards men, and whether he is averse to being handled; for <lb/>
            all such defects are troublesome to his owner.</p>
          <p>11. As to any reluctance to being bridled and mounted, and <lb/>
            other tricks,2 a person will much sooner discover them, if, <lb/>
            when the horse has been thoroughly exercised, he attempt to <lb/>
            do to him3 what he did before he began to ride him; since <lb/>
            horses that, after having been exercised, are ready to submit <lb/>
            to exercise again, give sufficient proofs of a mettlesome spirit.</p>
          <p>12. To sum up all in a few words, whatever horse has good <lb/>
            feet, is mild-tempered, sufficiently swift, is willing and able to <lb/>
            endure fatigue, and is in the highest degree obedient, will <lb/>
            probably give least trouble to his rider, and contribute most <lb/>
            to his safety in military occupations. But horses that from <lb/>
            sluggishness require a great deal of driving, or, from excess <lb/>
            of mettle, much coaxing and care, afford plenty of employ­ <lb/>
            ment to the rider, as well as much apprehension in time of <lb/>
            danger. <note type="footnote"> 1 '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Έσφηλαν</foreign>.] Sturz, in his Lexicon, makes this equivalent to excus­ <lb/>

          <p>Attention necessary to be paid to a horse by its owner.</p>
          <p>1 WHEN a man has purchased a horse that he admires, and <lb/>
            taken him home, it is proper that his stable should be in some <lb/>
            part of the premises where the master may see him most fre­ <lb/>
            quently ; and it will be right for him to construct the stall in <lb/>
            such a way that it may no more be possible for the horse's <lb/>
            food to be stolen from the manger than the master's from his <lb/>
            cellar. He that is neglectful of such precaution appears to <lb/>
            me to be neglectful of himself; for it is evident that in danger <lb/>
            the master trusts his personal safety to his horse.</p>
          <p>2. A secure manger is not only serviceable to prevent the <lb/>
            food from being stolen, but to let it be seen when the horse <lb/>
            scatters his food out of the manger ;1 and if a person perceives <lb/>
            that such is the case, he may be sure, either that the horse, <lb/>
            having too much blood in his body, requires veterinary atten­ <lb/>
            tion, or that, from fatigue having affected him, he needs rest, <lb/>
            or that indigestion 2 or some other malady is coming upon <lb/>
            him ; and it is with horses as with men, that all diseases are <lb/>
            more easily cured at the commencement than after they have <lb/>
            acquired strength, and mistakes have been made in the treat­ <lb/>
            ment of them.</p>
          <p>3. As attention must be paid to a horse's food and exercise, <lb/>
            that his body may be vigorous, so must care be likewise taken <lb/>
            of his feet. Damp and smooth stable floors injure even na­ <lb/>
            turally good hoofs; and to prevent them from being damp, <lb/>
            they ought to be sloping; to prevent them from being <note type="footnote"> 1 ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Εκκομίζῃ</foreign>.] SC. EK <foreign xml:lang="grc">τη̃ς φάτνης</foreign>.As a horse will do when he dislikes <lb/>

            it ought to be removed, that by having wanted food for a certain time, <lb/>
            his appetite may call for it; he will then relish what he eats, and thrive <lb/>

            to one another, similar to a horse's hoofs in size; for such <lb/>
            stable floors give firmness to the feet of horses that stand on <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>4. The groom must also lead the horse out of the stable to <lb/>
            the place where he is to comb him ; and he should be tied <lb/>
            away from the manger after his morning's feed, that he may <lb/>
            come to his evening meal with the greater appetite. The <lb/>
            ground outside the stable may be put into excellent condition, <lb/>
            and serve to strengthen the horse's feet,2 if a person throws <lb/>
            down in it here and there four or five loads of round stones, <lb/>
            large enough to fill the two hands, and about a pound in <lb/>
            weight, surrounding them with an iron rim, so that they may <lb/>
            not be scattered; for, as the horse stands on these, he will be <lb/>
            in much the same condition as if he were to travel part of <lb/>
            every day on a stony road.3</p>
          <p>5. A horse must also move his hoofs when he is rubbed <lb/>
            down, or when he is annoyed with flies,4 as much as when he <lb/>
            is walking; and the stones which are thus spread about <lb/>
            strengthen the frogs of the feet. And as we must take care <lb/>
            of the hoofs, that they may be hard, so we must take care of <lb/>
            the mouth, that it may be soft; and the same treatment <lb/>

            horse's feet is wrong and injudicious. The litter, mixed with dung, heats <lb/>
            the feet and legs, and makes the hoofs become dry and brittle. Besides <lb/>
            this, the horse is not so much tempted to lie down at night, as he would <lb/>
            be if it were removed, and spread under him again at proper seasons. <lb/>

          <p>Qualifications and duties of a groom.</p>
          <p>1. IT seems to us to be the duty of a man who keeps horses <lb/>
            to see that his groom be instructed1 as to what he ought to do <lb/>
            about a horse. In the first place, he should know that the <lb/>
            knot of the halter which ties the horse to the manger should <lb/>
            never be made in the same place where the head-piece 2 is put <lb/>
            round ; for as the horse often rubs his head against the man­ <lb/>
            ger, the halter, if it be not easy around his ears, will frequently <lb/>
            cause sore places; and, in consequence of such sores, the horse <lb/>
            must necessarily prove less tractable under the operations of <lb/>
            bridling and rubbing.</p>
          <p>2. It is right, also, that the groom should be ordered to <lb/>
            carry out the dung and straw from the horse every day, to <lb/>
            some one particular place ;3 for, by so doing, he will get rid <lb/>
            of it with the greatest ease, and at the same time do a service <lb/>
            to the horse.</p>
          <p>3. The groom must likewise know that. he should put the <lb/>
            muzzle 4 on the horse when he takes him out, whether to be <lb/>
            rubbed down or for exercise ; and 5 at all times, indeed, when­ <lb/>
            ever he takes him out without a bit, he should muzzle him ; for <lb/>
            the muzzle does not hinder him from breathing, though it pre­ <lb/>
            vents him from biting ; and, when it is on, it makes them feel <lb/>
            less inclined to play vicious tricks.6 <note type="footnote"> Berenger supposes that nothing more is meant than that we should " do <lb/>
            nothing to injure or hurt the mouth, so as to make it insensible or callous, <lb/>
            and then it will naturally be soft and tender." </note><note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πεπαιδευ̃σϑαι</foreign>.]Weiske takes this in a middle sense . Ut sibi insti­ <lb/>

          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="§ 4-7.]"/> 4. It is proper to tie up a horse with the halter above his <lb/>
            head; for whatever annoys a horse about the face, he na­ <lb/>
            turally tries to get rid of by throwing up his head; and when <lb/>
            he is thus tied, he rather, as he throws up his head, loosens <lb/>
            his halter than tightens it.1</p>
          <p>5. When the groom rubs down the horse, he should begin <lb/>
            with the head and the mane; for if the upper parts are not <lb/>
            clean, it is useless to clean those below ; and then, with all <lb/>
            sorts of cleansing instruments, he should raise the hair over <lb/>
            the rest of the body, and brush away the dust in the contrary <lb/>
            direction to that in which the hair grows; but the hair on the <lb/>
            back he ought to touch with no instrument at all, but to rub <lb/>
            and smooth it down gently with the hand the way that it na­ <lb/>
            turally lies, for thus he will do less injury to the seat of the <lb/>
            horse.</p>
          <p>6. The head he should wash with water ; for, being bony, <lb/>
            if it were cleaned with anything made of iron or wood,2 it <lb/>
            would pain the horse. The forelock he should also moisten; 3 <lb/>
            for while these hairs, though of a good length, do not prevent <lb/>
            the horse from seeing, they brush away from his eyes what­ <lb/>
            ever annoys them; and we may suppose that the gods gave these <lb/>
            hairs to the horse instead of the long ears which they have <lb/>
            given to asses and mules, to be a protection to the eyes. 7. <lb/>
            The tail and the mane it is also proper to wash, since we <lb/>
            should encourage the growth of this hair; that of the tail, in <lb/>
            order that the horse, stretching it out as far as possible, may <lb/>
            brush off whatever molests him;4 and that of the neck, that, <note type="footnote">signify the playing of any tricks, or doing any mischief, whether to other <lb/>
            horses or to men. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 By such a mode of tying, the horse will not be irritated, and the halter <lb/>

            it needless to dwell upon them; yet such is the cruelty and absurdity of <lb/>
            our notions and customs in cropping, as it is called, the ears of our horses, <lb/>
            and docking and nicking their tails, that we every day fly in the face of <lb/>
            reason, nature, and humanity. Nor are the present race of men in this <lb/>
            island alone to be charged with this folly, almost unbecoming the ignorance <lb/>
            and cruelty of savages; but their forefathers, several centuries ago, were <lb/>
            charged and reprehended by a public canon for this absurd and tarbarous <lb/>
            practice. See Spelman's Councils of England, vol. i. p. 293. </note> <pb n="280"/>

            being abundant, it may afford an ample grasp to the person <lb/>
            mounting.</p>
          <p>8. The mane, fore-lock, and tail have been given by the gods <lb/>
            as additions to the beauty of a horse ; and a proof of this is, <lb/>
            that mares kept for breeding do not so readily admit asses to <lb/>
            cover them, as long as their hair is of its natural length; and <lb/>
            in consequence, all those who breed mules cut off the hair of <lb/>
            the mares to prepare them for being covered.1</p>
          <p>9. Washing of the legs we omit; for it is of no use, and <lb/>
            the daily wetting does harm to the hoofs. It is proper, also, <lb/>
            to moderate the excessive cleaning under the belly ; for it is <lb/>
            the most troublesome of all cleaning to the horse ; and the <lb/>
            cleaner those parts are made, the more annoyances2 they at­ <lb/>
            tract under the belly. 10. Besides, if a groom takes ever so <lb/>
            much pains with those parts, the horse is no sooner taken out, <lb/>
            than he is exactly in the same condition as horses that have <lb/>
            not been cleaned. These things it is therefore well to let <lb/>
            alone ; and in regard to the legs, too, such rubbing of them <lb/>
            as can be performed with the hands is sufficient.</p>

            thus receive no injury, and may clean the frog of the horse's <lb/>
            foot by turning up the hoof. In like manner let him clean <lb/>
            the hind legs.</p>
          <p>3. But whoever is employed about a horse, ought to know <lb/>
            ,hat to do these things, and everything else that he has to do, <lb/>
            he must come as little as possible near the face and the tail; <lb/>
            for if a horse is inclined to be vicious, he has in both these parts <lb/>
            the advantage of the man. But a person who approaches him <lb/>
            at the side may manage the horse with least danger to him­ <lb/>
            self, and with most power over the beast.3</p>
          <p>4. When we have to lead a horse, we do not approve of <lb/>
            the practice of leading from behind, for these reasons, that <lb/>
            the person leading the horse is thus least able to keep on his <lb/>
            guard against him, and the horse has most liberty to do what <lb/>
            he pleases. 5. To the mode, again, of conducting him with a <lb/>
            long rein, to teach him to go forward and take the lead, we <lb/>
            object for the following reasons, that the horse can do mis­ <lb/>
            chief on whichever side he pleases, and that, by turning him­ <lb/>
            self round,4 he can set himself opposite his leader. 6. When <lb/>
            there are a number of horses together, too, how, if they are <lb/>
            thus led, can they be prevented from annoying one another ? <lb/>
            But a horse that is accustomed to be led at the side, will be <lb/>
            least in a condition to molest either other horses or men, and <lb/>
            will be readiest at hand for his rider whenever he may require <lb/>
            to mount in haste. <note type="footnote"> 1 That is, while he is cleaning the fore-feet. Schneider. </note><note type="footnote"> a <foreign xml:lang="grc">Καθίζων</foreign>.]Schneider suspects this word to be corrupt; but <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατιών</foreign>, <lb/>

          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="[CH. 6."/> 7. That the groom may put on the bridle properly, let <lb/>
            him first approach the horse on the left side, and then throw­ <lb/>
            ing the reins over the horse's head, let him suffer them to <lb/>
            rest on the point of the shoulder ; and next let him take the <lb/>
            head-piece in his right hand, and apply the bit with his left. <lb/>
            8. If the horse take the bit into his mouth, the man has nothing <lb/>
            to do but put on the head-piece; but if the horse will not open <lb/>
            his mouth, the man must hold the bit to his teeth, and insert <lb/>
            the middle finger of his left hand between the horse's bars ; <lb/>
            for most horses, when this is done, open their mouths; should <lb/>
            the horse, however, not even then receive the bit, let him press <lb/>
            the lip against the dog-tooth or tusk, and there are very few <lb/>
            horses that, on feeling this, will not admit it.</p>
          <p>9. Let the groom also be instructed in the following points. <lb/>
            First, never to lead the horse by the bridle, for this practice <lb/>
            makes horses harder on one side of the mouth than on the <lb/>
            other ; and, next, to keep the bit from pressing on his jaws as <lb/>
            much as possible ; for if the bit rubs on them too much, it <lb/>
            renders the mouth callous, so that it loses all feeling ; though <lb/>
            on the other hand, if it is allowed to fall down too much to­ <lb/>
            wards the front of the mouth, it gives the horse an oppor­ <lb/>
            tunity of seizing the bit between his teeth, and refusing to <lb/>
            obey it. 10. It is proper, however, that a horse should not be <lb/>
            irritated by these matters when he has work to do ; for so <lb/>
            important is it that a horse should take the bit readily, that one <lb/>
            who does not take it is altogether useless. 11. But if he is <lb/>
            accustomed to be bitted, not only when he is going to work, <lb/>
            but when he is taken to his food, and when he is brought <lb/>
            home to his stable after being ridden, it will not be at all <lb/>
            surprising if he seize the bit of his own accord when it is held <lb/>
            towards him.</p>
          <p>12. It is well, too, that the groom should know how to as­ <lb/>
            sist a rider to mount after the Persian manner, 1 that the master <note type="footnote"> 1 Berenger observes that as stirrups were unknown in the days of <lb/>
            Xenophon, the methods of getting on horseback must have been to vault, <lb/>
            to step on a horse-block, or to mount after the Persian manner, which <lb/>
            was to set the foot on the back of a slave, who attended and bent himself <lb/>
            for that purpose. The slave who was subjected to this office was called <lb/>
            by the Greeks <foreign xml:lang="grc">άναολεύς</foreign>, Appian. Punic. 106; and by the Latins <lb/>
            strator, Ammian. Marcell. xxix. 3. It was thus that Sapor degraded the <lb/>
            conquered emperor, Valerian. </note> <pb n="283"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="§ 13-16.]"/> <lb/>
            himself, if he should be sick or advanced in years, may have <lb/>
            some one that can mount him easily, or may lend his servant <lb/>
            to a friend to mount him, if he wish to afford such assistance <lb/>
            to any one.</p>
          <p>13. But never to approach a horse in afit of anger is the <lb/>
            one great precept and maxim of conduct in regard to the <lb/>
            treatment of a horse ; for anger is destitute of forethought, <lb/>
            and consequently often does that of which the agent must <lb/>
            necessarily repent.</p>
          <p>14. When a horse is shy of any object, and reluctant to <lb/>
            approach it, the rider must try to make him feel1 that there is <lb/>
            nothing terrible in it, especially to a horse of spirit; but if he <lb/>
            cannot succeed, the rider must himself touch that which ap­ <lb/>
            pears so alarming, and lead the horse up gently to it. 15. As <lb/>
            to those who force horses forward with blows in such a case, <lb/>
            they only inspire them with greater terror ; for they imagine, <lb/>
            when they suffer any pain at such a time, that what they look <lb/>
            upon with alarm is in some way the cause of it.</p>
          <p>16. When the groom brings the horse to the rider, we have <lb/>
            no objection that he should know how to make the horse <lb/>
            stoop,2 so that it may be easy to mount him ; yet we think <lb/>
            every rider ought to take care to be able to mount, even if <lb/>
            the horse does not bend to him ; for sometimes a different <lb/>
            horse will present himself, and the same horse will not always <lb/>
            be equally obedient.</p>

            received his horse for the purpose of mounting him, so <note type="footnote"> 1 By speaking cheerfully to him, patting him, and giving him other <lb/>

            as to be of most service alike to himself and to his horse in <lb/>
            riding.</p>
          <p>In the first place, then, he must take the rein, 1 which is <lb/>
            fastened to the lower part of the bit,2 or to the chain that goes <lb/>
            under the chin,3 in his left hand, in a convenient manner, <lb/>
            and so loosely, that he may not, either as he raises himself by <lb/>
            grasping the mane near the ears, or jumps on the horse's back <lb/>
            with the assistance of his spear,4 pull the animal back. Then, <lb/>
            with his right hand, let him take hold of the bridle 5 at the <lb/>
            point of the shoulder, and of the mane at the same time, that <lb/>
            he may not in any way, as he mounts, twist the horse's mouth <lb/>
            with the bit. 2. When he has set himself at ease for mount­ <lb/>
            ing, let him draw up his body with his left hand, and, stretch­ <lb/>
            ing forth his right, let him lift himself with that also (for, <lb/>
            mounting in this way, he will not present an ungraceful ap­ <lb/>
            pearance behind), and let him do this with his leg bent, and <lb/>
            not rest his knees on the back of the horse, but throw his leg <lb/>
            across at once to the right side; and when he has passed his <lb/>
            foot clean over, let him then seat himself on the horse's back. <note type="footnote"> think that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπόασις</foreign>, c. 1, sect. 14, means subsessio, but this inter­ <lb/>

            till lately, puzzled all the antiquaries and commentators, who have not <lb/>
            been able to give any satisfactory account of it. In the collection of the <lb/>
            Pates Antiques, belonging to the late celebrated Baron Stock, there is one <lb/>
            which represents a soldier as going to mount his horse by the assistance <lb/>
            of his spear. The spear is planted at the side of the horse, and has a <lb/>
            hook upon the shaft, on which the man placing his foot easily bestrides <lb/>
            the horse. This, at first sight, explains the above passage. Livy men­ <lb/>
            tions likewise this method of getting on horseback as practised by the <lb/>
            Roman soldiers. N. B. This collection is now in the British Museum. <lb/>

          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="§ 3 -8.]"/> 3. It seems to us also very proper, in case a rider should <lb/>
            happen to be leading his horse with his left hand, and to be <lb/>
            holding his lance in his right, to practise mounting on the <lb/>
            right side ;1 but for this he has nothing more to learn, than <lb/>
            to perform those movements with his left hand and foot which <lb/>
            lie had previously performed with his right. 4. We com­ <lb/>
            mend such readiness in mounting for this reason, that the rider, <lb/>
            as soon as he is seated on the horse, is in every way prepared <lb/>
            for action, if it should be necessary to encounter an enemy on <lb/>
            a sudden.</p>
          <p>5. When he has taken his seat, whether on the horse's bare <lb/>
            back or on the clothe we do not like that he should sit as if he <lb/>
            were on a carriage seat, but as if he were standing upright <lb/>
            with his legs somewhat apart ; 3 for thus he will cling more <lb/>
            firmly to the horse with his thighs, and, keeping himself erect, <lb/>
            he will be able to throw a javelin or to strike a blow on <lb/>
            horseback, if it be necessary, with greater force.</p>
          <p>6. But it is necessary to allow the leg, as well as the foot, <lb/>
            to hang loose from the knee ; for if a rider keep his leg stiff, <lb/>
            and strike it against anything, it may be broken ; but if the leg <lb/>
            hangs easy, and anything strikes against it, it will yield, and <lb/>
            yet not move the thigh from its position.</p>
          <p>7. A rider should also accustom himself to keep the parts <lb/>
            of his body above the hips as flexible as possible ; for he will <lb/>
            by this means be better able to exert himself, and if any person <lb/>
            should drag or push him, he will be less likely to be thrown off.</p>
          <p>8. Let it be observed, too, that when he is seated on the <lb/>
            horse's back, he must first teach the horse to stand quiet, until <lb/>
            he has drawn up his mantle,4 if necessary, and adjusted the <lb/>
            reins, and taken hold of his lance in such a way as it may most <lb/>
            conveniently be carried. Then let him keep his left arm <note type="footnote">1 Another gem, in the same collection, gives us the figure of a soldier <lb/>
            standing by a horse in the attitude of a man going to mount him on <lb/>

            close to his side ; for in such an attitude a rider appears most <lb/>
            graceful, 1 and his hand has the greatest power.</p>
          <p>9. As to reins, we approve of such as are equally <lb/>
            balanced, and not weak, or slippery, or too thick, so that the <lb/>
            hand which holds them may be able also to hold the spear <lb/>
            when it is necessary.</p>
          <p>10. When the rider gives the signal to the horse to start, <lb/>
            let him begin to advance at a walking pace, as this pace is <lb/>
            least likely to disturb the horse. Let him bold the reins, if <lb/>
            the horse is inclined to bold down his head, rather high ; but <lb/>
            if he is more disposed to carry it erect, let him keep them <lb/>
            lower, for thus he will best set off the horse's figure, 11. <lb/>
            After a little, if he trots at his natural pace,2 he will find <lb/>
            his limbs become pliant without inconvenience, and will come <lb/>
            with the greatest readiness to obey the whip.3 Since, too, it <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Εὺσταλέστατος</foreign>.] Hie enim gestus equitem maxims decet. Leuncla­ <lb/>

            In like manner Sophocles has used the verb <foreign xml:lang="grc">έπισείειν</foreign>. Sauppe. Sturz <lb/>
            interprets the word, in his Lexicon, virgâ instigare ad cursum. But it <lb/>
            must be taken in a neuter sense in this passage. " Obéir aux avertisse­ <lb/>
            ments de la verge." Gail. " To be exerted and animated with the <lb/>
            whip." Berenger. Donaldson, in his " New Cratylus," p. 224, says that <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">έπιραβδοφορε</foreign>ĩ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ν</foreign> is " to gallop," that is, to strike the ground alternately <lb/>
            with the fore and hind feet, from " the primary idea in <foreign xml:lang="grc">ῥάβδος</foreign>," which <lb/>
            is that of " beating" or " striking." The word may imply galloping, <lb/>
            and there is little doubt that it does, but hardly for the reason which Dr <lb/>
            Donaldson gives; for, in that case what would be the use of <foreign xml:lang="grc">φορε</foreign>ĩ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ν</foreign> in the <lb/>
            word ? The primary and proper meaning of a verb, compounded of the <lb/>
            three elements in <foreign xml:lang="grc">έπιραβδοφορε</foreign>ĩ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ν</foreign> would seem to be, when used in a neuter <lb/>
            sense, " to endure the switch so as to hasten forward." The horses o <lb/>
            some of- the ancient nations were guided wholly by the rod or switch <lb/>
            without bit or bridle. Thus the Massylians are described in Lucan, iv. 682, <lb/>
            Et gens, quæ nudo residens Massylia dorso, <lb/>
            Ora levi fiectit, frænorum nescia, virga. <lb/>
            Massylia's nimble horsemen ride ; <lb/>
            They nor the bit, nor curbing rein provide, <lb/>
            But with light rods the well-taught coursers guide. Rowe <lb/>

            is the most approved practice to set off towards the left side, <lb/>
            the horse will most readily start on that side, 1 if, when he lifts, <lb/>
            as he is trotting, his right foot,2 the rider then give him the <lb/>
            signal to gallop. 12. For, being then about to raise the left <lb/>
            foot, he will thus start with that foot; and just at the mo­ <lb/>
            ment that the rider turns him to the left, he will make the <lb/>
            first spring 3 in his gallop; for a horse, when be is turned to <lb/>
            the right, naturally leads off with the right foot, and when <lb/>
            turned to the left, with the left foot. <lb/>
            is. As to the mode of exercising a horse, we approve of <lb/>
            that which is called the pede,4 for it accustoms a horse to be <lb/>
            turned by both sides of his mouth ; and it is good to change <lb/>
            the direction of his course, that both sides may receive equal <lb/>
            stress in the different directions. 14. We approve, too, of a <lb/>
            place of exercise of an oblong form,5 in preference to the <lb/>
            round; for in the oblong the horse may be turned with the <lb/>
            greater ease, when tired of going straight forward, and he <lb/>
            will be exercised at once in running in a direct course and in <lb/>
            turning.</p>
          <p>15. It is proper also to pull in the rein 6 as the horse turns ; <note type="footnote">" The Nomades or Numidians, a nation ignorant of the rein, and whose <lb/>

            the signal to gallop was given with the rod or switch. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 The meaning of this seems to be, that when the rider intends to <lb/>

            for it is not easy for a horse, nor safe, when going fast, to turn <lb/>
            in a small spacer especially if the ground be rough 2 or slip­ <lb/>
            pery. 16. But at the time that the rider pulls him in, he <lb/>
            ought to sway the horse as little as possible with the bit, and <lb/>
            to sway himself also as little as possible; for if he sways <lb/>
            himself much, he may be well assured that a very small im­ <lb/>
            pulse will be sufficient to stretch both him and his horse on <lb/>
            the ground.</p>
          <p>• 17. When the horse, after having turned, looks straight be­ <lb/>
            fore him, the rider should then excite him to greater speed;3 <lb/>
            for it is plain that turnings are made in war either for pur-. <lb/>
            suing or retreating, and hence it is good to accustom a horse, <lb/>
            after he has turned, to increase his speed.</p>
          <p>18. Also, when the horse appears to have been sufficiently <lb/>
            exercised, it is useful, after having let him rest a while, to <lb/>
            excite him on a sudden to his utmost speed, as well away from <lb/>
            the other horses as towards them; and, after he has been put to <lb/>
            his speed, to let him rest somewhere as near as possible,4 and, <lb/>
            when he has stood still awhile, to wheel him about and urge <lb/>
            him again to a gallop; for it is certain that occasions will <lb/>
            offer when he will have need to practise both.</p>
          <p>19. But when it is time to dismount, the rider should <lb/>
            never alight either among other horses, or amidst a concourse <lb/>
            of people, or beyond the exercise ground; but in the place <lb/>
            where the horse is obliged to exert himself, there let him also <lb/>
            begin to rest.</p>

          <p>How a horse is to be taught to leap. How he is to be prepared for military <lb/>
            service.</p>
          <p>1. SINCE there will be occasions when the horse will have <lb/>

            sides of hills, when he will have to leap over obstacles, and <lb/>
            to spring up and down, the rider must train and exercise both <lb/>
            himself and his horse completely in all these manoeuvres; <lb/>
            for thus they will be likely to contribute more to the safety <lb/>
            and advantage of each other. 2. If any one thinks that we <lb/>
            are merely repeating ourselves, because we now make men­ <lb/>
            tion of the same things that we mentioned before,1 let him <lb/>
            understand that this is not a repetition ; for we then exhorted <lb/>
            a horseman, when he purchased a horse, to try whether the <lb/>
            animal could perform such exercises ; but now we say that he <lb/>
            must teach his own horse, and are going to prescribe how he <lb/>
            must teach him.</p>
          <p>3. He that has got a horse utterly inexperienced in leaping <lb/>
            over ditches must, after slackening the leading-rein, go over <lb/>
            the ditch first, and must then pull him on with the rein, that <lb/>
            he may take the leap. 4. If he will not leap, another person <lb/>
            must take a whip or a switch, and apply it on him smartly, <lb/>
            when he will not only leap over the required space, but much <lb/>
            further than is necessary; and afterwards there will be no <lb/>
            need to strike him, for if he only sees some one coming be­ <lb/>
            hind him, he will leap.</p>
          <p>5. When he has thus been trained to leap, let the rider mount <lb/>
            him, and take him first to small, and then to larger ditches. <lb/>
            Just as he is going to leap, let the rider touch him with the <lb/>
            spur. Let him spur him, too, when he is teaching him to leap <lb/>
            up and down from any height; for if the horse does all these <lb/>
            things with an impulse of his whole body, he will do them <lb/>
            with more safety to himself and his rider than if his hinder <lb/>
            parts lag either in leaping over an object or in springing up <lb/>
            or down.</p>
          <p>6. To make him go down steep places, we must begin to <lb/>
            train him on soft ground; and at length, when he is accus­ <lb/>
            tomed to this, he will run much more readily down a slope <lb/>
            than up it. As to what some people fear, that horses will <lb/>
            dislocate their shoulders in being ridden down steep places, <lb/>
            let them be under no apprehension, when they are told that <lb/>
            the Persians and the Odrysæ all ride as fast as they can down <lb/>
            steep hills, and yet have horses not less sound than those of <lb/>
            the Greeks. <note type="footnote"> I C. iii. sect. 7. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 To which the spur will incite him. </note> <note type="footnote"> TOL. III. </note> <note type="footnote"> U </note></p><pb n="290"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="[CH. 8."/> 7. Nor will we omit to mention how the rider must accom­ <lb/>
            modate himself to each of these particular circumstances; for <lb/>
            he ought, when his horse suddenly raises himself for a leap, <lb/>
            to lean forward (since by that means the horse will feel less <lb/>
            pressure on his hinder parts, 1 and will be less likely to shake <lb/>
            the rider), and, as he pulls in the reins when the horse alights, <lb/>
            he must throw himself back, for he will thus be less jolted.</p>
          <p>8. As the horse is leaping over a ditch, or stretching up an <lb/>
            ascent, it is well for the rider to take hold of the mane,2 that <lb/>
            the horse may not be oppressed by the difficulty of the ground <lb/>
            and by the bit at the same time ; but in going down a declivity, <lb/>
            he should hold himself back, and support the horse with the <lb/>
            bridle, that himself and his horse may not be carried headlong <lb/>
            down the slope.</p>
          <p>9. It is right, also, to exercise the horse sometimes in one <lb/>
            place and sometimes in another, sometimes for a longer an 1 <lb/>
            sometimes for a shorter period; for this will be less disagree­ <lb/>
            able to the horse than to be always exercised in the same <lb/>
            place and for the same length of time.</p>
          <p>10. Since it is necessary, too, for him who rides his horse <lb/>
            at full speed over all sorts of ground to be able to sit firmly <lb/>
            „ on him, and to know how to use his arms on horseback dex­ <lb/>
            terously, the practice of horsemanship in hunting is to be <lb/>
            commended, where the country is favourable, and wild beasts <lb/>
            to be found; but where these conveniences do not offer them­ <lb/>
            selves, it is a good sort of exercise for two horsemen to make <lb/>
            such an arrangement as this: that the one is to retreat over <lb/>
            ground of a varied character, and, as he flees, is to turn about; <lb/>
            from time to time and present his spear, while the other is to <lb/>
            pursue, carrying javelins blunted with balls, and a spear pre­ <lb/>
            pared in the same manner ; and whenever the pursuer comes <lb/>
            within a javelin's throw of the pursued, he is to discharge his <lb/>
            blunted javelins at him, and, whenever he gets within the <lb/>
            stroke of a spear, to strike him as he is overtaken. <note type="footnote"> 1 'HTTOV <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂν ὑποδύοι όἲππος</foreign>.] The horse will sink down less be­ <lb/>
            hind. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποδύειν</foreign> is dorso subsidere, as Schneider observes. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Whatever notions the Greeks might have of this method, and al­ <lb/>
            though it is prescribed by Xenophon, it seems to be flatly against truth <lb/>
            and the principles of the art; for the bridle, instead of being an encum­ <lb/>
            brance to the horse, will be of great assistance, if seasonably and judi­ <lb/>
            ciously used, and, by guiding and supporting, will prevent him from <lb/>
            failing. Berenger. </note></p><pb n="291"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="§ 11—14.]"/> 11. It is well for a horseman, also, if he close with an ene­ <lb/>
            my, to pull his enemy towards him, and then suddenly push <lb/>
            him away; for this treatment is likely to unhorse him. On <lb/>
            the other hand, it is well for him who is thus dragged to urge <lb/>
            his horse forward; for by this means he is more likely to <lb/>
            throw off his antagonist than to fall off himself.</p>
          <p>12. If, on any occasion, when two camps are pitched opposite, <lb/>
            the cavalry ride out against one another, and one party pur­ <lb/>
            sue their adversaries close up to their main body, and then <lb/>
            retreat to their own, it is good for a rider to know that in <lb/>
            such circumstances, as long as he is near his friends, it is <lb/>
            right and safe to wheel about among the foremost, and charge <lb/>
            the enemy at full speed 1; but he must take care, as he comes <lb/>
            close upon them, to have his horse under control; for, by act­ <lb/>
            ing with such caution, he will be in the best condition, as is <lb/>
            probable, to injure the enemy and to escape injury from <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>is. The gods have enabled men to teach other men by <lb/>
            speech what they ought to do. As for a horse, it is certain <lb/>
            that you can teach him nothing by speech; but if, when he <lb/>
            does what you wish, you gratify him in some way in return, <lb/>
            and, when he is disobedient, make him feel punishment, he <lb/>
            will thus effectually learn to obey you in what is required of <lb/>
            him. 14. This we may express, indeed, in a few words, <lb/>
            but it should influence us throughout all our treatment of <lb/>
            horses; for a horse will more readily take the bit, if, when <lb/>
            he has taken it, something pleasant results to himself; and he <lb/>
            will leap across ditches, and jump over obstacles, and comply <lb/>
            with our wishes in all other respects, if he looks forward, <lb/>
            when he has done what is required of him, to some in­ <lb/>
            dulgence. <note type="footnote"> 1 As they wheel round, it will be proper for him to be among the <lb/>
            foremost to charge the enemy. It will be proper for him to be in <lb/>

          <p>How fierce and high-mettled horses are to be managed.</p>
          <p>1. THE directions which I have given show how a person <lb/>
            may best avoid being deceived in purchasing a colt or a full- <lb/>
            grown horse; how he is least likely to spoil him in putting <lb/>
            him to use, more especially if he would produce a horse having <lb/>
            all the qualities that a horseman requires for war. But per­ <lb/>
            haps it is now proper to state how a rider, if he ever happen <lb/>
            to have a horse excessively fiery, or excessively sluggish, may <lb/>
            treat either of them with the most success.</p>
          <p>2. In the first place, then, he ought to know that spirit in a <lb/>
            horse is what anger is in a man ; and as a person who should <lb/>
            neither say nor do anything annoying to a man would be <lb/>
            least likely to anger him, so the rider that does nothing to vex <lb/>
            a high-spirited horse will be least likely to provoke him. <lb/>
            3. Accordingly he must be careful, even from the very time <lb/>
            that he mounts such a horse, not to discompose him as he <lb/>
            takes his seat; and when he is fairly seated, he should allow <lb/>
            him to stand quiet for a longer time than a horse of ordinary <lb/>
            spirit, 1 and then direct him to go forward with the gentlest <lb/>
            possible intimations. Beginning to proceed, too, at the slow­ <lb/>
            est pace, he should bring him into a quicker one, in such a <lb/>
            manner, that the horse may be as little sensible as possible <lb/>
            that he is accelerating his course. 4. But whatever a rider <lb/>
            requires a spirited horse to do suddenly, the unexpected sights, <lb/>
            or sounds, or sensations, consequent upon it, annoy him, as they <lb/>
            would annoy a passionate man; and it is necessary to bear in <lb/>
            mind that everything sudden produces perplexity in a horse. <lb/>
            5. If therefore you wish to rein in a spirited horse when he is <lb/>
            going faster than is necessary, you must not check him sud­ <lb/>
            denly, but pull him in with the bridle gently, coaxing, and <lb/>
            not forcing him, to slacken his pace.</p>
          <p>6. Long rides in a direct course, too, soothe horses more <lb/>
            than frequent short turnings ; and long gentle rides also soft­ <lb/>
            en and tame, and do not exasperate, the high-mettled horse. <note type="footnote"> 1 "H <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸν έπιτυχόντα</foreign>.] Than an ordinary or every-day horse, one <lb/>
            of less spirit and fire. Weisk </note> <pb n="293"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="§ 7-12.]"/> <lb/>
            7. But if any one imagines that if he rides at a hard pace for a <lb/>
            long distance, he will render his horse gentle by fatiguing him, <lb/>
            he supposes what is quite contrary to experience ; for a high- <lb/>
            spirited horse, in such circumstances, uses his utmost en­ <lb/>
            deavours to get the better by force and with anger, like an <lb/>
            angry man, and often does irreparable mischief both to him­ <lb/>
            self and to his rider.</p>
          <p>8. It is proper also to check a high-mettled horse from gal­ <lb/>
            loping at full speed, and to abstain altogether from matching <lb/>
            him with other horses ; for horses that grow fond of contending <lb/>
            against others become also the most refractory.</p>
          <p>9. Smooth bits are more eligible for such a horse than <lb/>
            rough. If a rough bit be used, we ought to assimilate it tc <lb/>
            a smooth one by keeping it slack.1 It is well, too, for the <lb/>
            rider to accustom himself to sit quiet on a fiery-spirited horse, <lb/>
            and to touch him as little as possible with anything else2 be­ <lb/>
            sides those parts of the body with which we necessarily touch <lb/>
            him in order to sit secure.</p>
          <p>10. A rider should know, also, that it is a rule to moderate <lb/>
            a horse's pace with a sort of whistle, and to urge him forward <lb/>
            with a clucking sound ; yet that if a person should from the <lb/>
            first move him to gentle exertions with a clucking sound, and to <lb/>
            more difficult efforts with a whistle, he would learn to quicken <lb/>
            his pace at the whistle, and to moderate it at the cluck.</p>
          <p>11. Likewise, when a shout is raised, or a trumpet sounded, <lb/>
            a person should not appear to a horse to be at all disturbed, <lb/>
            or approach him with anything that may alarm him, but <lb/>
            should, under such circumstances, use his utmost efforts to <lb/>
            pacify him, and, if convenient, should bring him his morning <lb/>
            or evening feed.</p>
          <p>12. It is a very judicious piece of advice, too, not to pur­ <lb/>
            chase a very high-mettled horse for service in war. As to a <lb/>
            sluggish horse, it appears to me sufficient to observe, that a <lb/>
            rider must treat him in a manner quite contrary to that in <lb/>
            which we recommend him to treat a horse of high spirit. <note type="footnote"> 1 This observation is most just. It is from the manner of managing <lb/>
            them alone that bits are easy or severe to the mouth of the horse ; other <lb/>
            wise, as the Duke of Newcastle says, the bit-makers would be the best <lb/>
            horsemen. Berenger. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 We should not touch him, for instance, with the spear or javelin. <lb/>

          <p>Of the proper management of the bit and bridle.</p>
          <p>i. BUT whoever would desire to have a horse serviceable <lb/>
            for war, and at the same time of a stately and striking figure <lb/>
            to ride, must abstain from pulling his mouth with the bit, and <lb/>
            from spurring and whipping him ; practices which some <lb/>
            people adopt in the notion that they are setting their horses <lb/>
            off; but they produce a quite contrary effect from that which <lb/>
            they intend. 2. For by drawing the mouths of their horses <lb/>
            up, they blind them when they ought to see clearly before <lb/>
            them, and they frighten them so much by spurring and strik­ <lb/>
            ing them, that they are confused and run headlong into <lb/>
            danger ; acts which distinguish such horses as are most averse <lb/>
            to being ridden, and as conduct themselves improperly and <lb/>
            unbecomingly. 3. But if a rider teach his horse to go with <lb/>
            the bridle loose, to carry his neck high, and to arch it from <lb/>
            the head onwards, lie would thus lead him to do everything <lb/>
            in which the animal himself takes pleasure and pride.</p>
          <p>4. That he does take pleasure in such actions, we see suf­ <lb/>
            ficient proof; for whenever he approaches other horses, and <lb/>
            especially when he comes to mares, he rears his neck aloft, <lb/>
            bends his head gallantly, throws out his legs with nimbleness, <lb/>
            and carries his tail erect. 5. When a rider, therefore, can <lb/>
            prompt him to assume that figure which he himself assumes <lb/>
            when he wishes to set off his beauty, he will thus exhibit his <lb/>
            steed as taking pride in being ridden, and having a magnificent, <lb/>
            noble, and distinguished appearance.</p>
          <p>By what means we consider that such results maybe attained, <lb/>
            we will now endeavour to show. 6. First of all, then, it is <lb/>
            necessary for a rider to have not less than two bits ; and of <lb/>
            these let one be smooth, and have rings of a moderate size;1 <lb/>
            and let the other have rings that are heavy, and hang lower down, <lb/>
            with sharp points;2 in order that, when the horse takes the latter <lb/>
            into his mouth, he may be offended with its roughness, and <lb/>
            consequently let it go, but when he finds it exchanged for the <note type="footnote"> 1 Julius Pollux (1. 184) mentions these orbs or rings; and our olive <lb/>
            bits seem to resemble them. Berenger. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Εχίνους</foreign>, points like the prickles on the back of a hedge-hog. </note> <pb n="295"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="§ 7-10.]"/> <lb/>
            other, he may be pleased with its smoothness ; and that what­ <lb/>
            ever he has been trained to do with the rough bit, he may do <lb/>
            also with the smooth. 7. But if, from making light of it for <lb/>
            its smoothness, he press upon it frequently with his teethe we <lb/>
            in that case add large rings to the smooth bit, that, being <lb/>
            compelled by them to open his mouth, he may let go the bit. <lb/>
            But it is possible to vary the rough bit in every way, by re­ <lb/>
            laxing or tightening it.</p>
          <p>8. But whatever sorts of bits are used, let them all be yield­ <lb/>
            ing ; for as to a stiff bit, wherever a horse seizes it, he has <lb/>
            the whole of it fast between his teeth, as a person, when he <lb/>
            takes up a spit, wherever he lays hold of it, raises up the <lb/>
            whole. 9. But the other sort of bit is similar to a chain ; for <lb/>
            of whatever part of it a person takes hold, that part alone re­ <lb/>
            mains unbent, but the rest hangs down. But as the horse is <lb/>
            always catching at the part which escapes him in his mouth, <lb/>
            he drops the bit out of his jaws; and to remedy this incon­ <lb/>
            venience rings2 are suspended by the middle from the two <lb/>
            parts of the bit,3 that while he catches at these with his <lb/>
            tongue and his teeth, he may omit to seize the bit between <lb/>
            his jaws.4</p>
          <p>10. In case any one should be ignorant what flexibility, and <lb/>
            rigidity, in a bit are, we will explain the terms ; for a bit is <lb/>
            flexible when the two parts of it have broad and smooth <lb/>
            joints, so as to be easily bent; and everything that is applied <lb/>
            about these two parts, if it fit loosely, and not with a close <note type="footnote">1 '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Απερείδηται έν αύτῳ̃</foreign>.] The sense of the verb is doubtful. Zeune <lb/>

            serve likewise to fix his attention, and prevent him from writhing his <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[CH. 10."/> <lb/>
            grasp, conduces to flexibility; but if every part of the bi' <lb/>
            opens and closes with difficulty, it is to be called hard.</p>
          <p>11. But whatever sort of bit is used, the rider must do <lb/>
            everything with it in the manner which I have stated, if he <lb/>
            wishes to make his horse such as has been described. 12. He - <lb/>
            must pull up the mouth of the horse neither too severely, so as <lb/>
            to provoke him to shake himself free from it, nor too gently, <lb/>
            so that he may be insensible to it. But when, on pulling him <lb/>
            up, he raises his neck, the rider must immediately give him the <lb/>
            bridle. In other respects, too, as we do not cease to repeat, <lb/>
            he must, whenever the horse has acquitted himself well, show <lb/>
            him some indulgence. 13. When he perceives that the horse <lb/>
            is pleased with carrying his head aloft, and with the looseness <lb/>
            of the rein, he should then put him to nothing disagreeable, <lb/>
            as if he would force him to exert himself, but should coax <lb/>
            him, as if he wished him to be at ease; for thus he will feel <lb/>
            greatly encouraged, and will advance of his own accord at a <lb/>
            swift pace.</p>
          <p>14. That a horse delights in going fast, there is sufficient <lb/>
            proof; for no horse, on getting loose, goes off at a slow pace, <lb/>
            but runs. With this speed he is naturally delighted, provided <lb/>
            we do not compel him to run longer than is reasonable; for <lb/>
            nothing whatever, immoderately protracted, is agreeable to <lb/>
            either horse or man.</p>
          <p>is. When the horse was brought to perform his exercise <lb/>
            with grace, he was trained by us,1 we know, in the early <lb/>
            part of his practice, to advance at full speed after sundry turns. <lb/>
            But if any rider, when his horse has learned to do this, <lb/>
            should rein him in, and give him at the same time a signal to <lb/>
            hasten forward, the horse, being at once checked by the bridle, <lb/>
            and incited to speed by the signal, will advance his chest, and <lb/>
            lift his legs higher in anger, but not with ease; for horses, <lb/>
            when they are annoyed, will assuredly not use their legs with <lb/>
            greater agility and grace. 16. But if when he is thus ani­ <lb/>
            mated, the rider gives him the bridle, he will then, from de­ <lb/>
            light at supposing himself, on account of the looseness of the <lb/>
            bit, freed from its restraint, bound forward with exultation, <lb/>
            in a noble attitude, and with an easy motion of his limbs, and <lb/>
            expressing in every gesture the grace with which he approaches <note type="footnote">1 In allusion to c. 7, sect. 17. </note> <pb n="297"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="§ 1—3]"/> <lb/>
            other horses. 17. Persons who view such a horse pronounce <lb/>
            him noble-spirited, prompt for action, fit for military exercise, <lb/>
            high-mettled, superb, and at once pleasing and formidable to <lb/>
            contemplate.</p>
          <p>If any one desires such qualities in a horse, let what we <lb/>
            have so far written serve as instructions for him.</p>

          <p>Of teaching a horse his paces. How to make him assume showy attitudes.</p>
          <p>1. BUT if a person wishes to possess a horse that is fit for <lb/>
            processions, and of lofty and magnificent bearing, such qualities <lb/>
            are not to be found in every horse, for he must be one that is <lb/>
            of a noble spirit and strong frame.</p>
          <p>2. But what some suppose, that a horse which has supple­ <lb/>
            ness of leg will also be able to rear his body high, is not the <lb/>
            case; the truth rather is, that it must be a horse which has <lb/>
            flexible, short, and strong loins (we do not mean the part by <lb/>
            the tail, but that which is between the ribs and the haunches, <lb/>
            at the belly), for such a horse will be able to extend his hind­ <lb/>
            er legs far forward under him. 3. If a rider, then, when the <lb/>
            horse has his hind legs thus under him, should pull him up <lb/>
            with the bridle, he rests his hinder parts on his heels, and <lb/>
            rears up the fore part of his body, so that his belly is seen by <lb/>
            those in front of him. But when he does this, it is proper to <lb/>
            give him the bridle, that he may assume of his own accord the <lb/>
            attitudes most graceful in a horse, and appear to the spectators <lb/>
            to do so.</p>
          <p>4. There are people who teach horses thus to rise, some by <lb/>
            striking them on the fetlocks with a stick, some by directing a <lb/>
            man, who runs at the side for that purpose, to hit them on the <lb/>
            upper part of the legs.1 5. We however consider it the best <lb/>
            mode of instruction, as we are perpetually saying, that when <lb/>
            ever a horse acts agreeably to the wishes of his rider, it should <note type="footnote"> I This method stands justified by the practice of modern horsemen <lb/>
            Berenger. </note> <pb n="298"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[CH. 11."/> <lb/>
            follow that he receive some indulgence from him. 6. For what <lb/>
            a horse does under compulsion, as Simo also observes, he does <lb/>
            without understanding, and with no more grace than a dancer <lb/>
            would display if a person should whip and spur him during <lb/>
            his performance; since both horse and man, when suffering <lb/>
            such treatment, would exhibit more ungraceful than graceful <lb/>
            gestures. But the rider ought to teach a horse by signs to <lb/>
            assume of his own accord all his most beautiful and showy <lb/>
            attitudes. 7. If, then, when he is exercised, he be ridden till <lb/>
            he is quite in a perspiration, and the rider, as soon as he raises <lb/>
            himself gracefully, dismounts and unbridles him, he may feel <lb/>
            assured that the horse will always be ready to rear himself of <lb/>
            his own accord.</p>
          <p>8. It is upon horses of this kind that gods and heroes are <lb/>
            painted riding, and men who are able to manage them skil­ <lb/>
            fully are regarded as deserving of admiration. 9. So extremely <lb/>
            beautiful, and admirable, and noble a sight is a horse that bears <lb/>
            himself superbly, that he fixes the gaze of all who see him, both <lb/>
            young and old; no one, indeed, leaves him, or is tired of con­ <lb/>
            templating him, as long as he continues to display his magni­ <lb/>
            ficent attitudes.1</p>
          <p>10. If it should ever happen to the possessor of such a <lb/>
            horse to be a phylarch 2 or hipparch,2 he ought not to <lb/>
            make it his study that he alone may enjoy distinction, but <lb/>
            rather that all the cavalry under his command may be de­ <lb/>
            serving of admiration. 11. Should such a horse precede the <lb/>
            rest, [as people esteem such horses most,] 3 one that, as he <lb/>
            advances, rears himself very high and very frequently, it is <lb/>
            plain that the other horses would follow him at a slow pace; <lb/>
            but what striking attraction could there be in such a specta­ <lb/>
            cle ? 12. If, however, while you animate your steed, you lead <lb/>
            neither with too great quickness nor with too great slowness, <lb/>
            but just as horses appear most lively and formidable, and best <lb/>
            adapted for exertion, if, I say, you precede the other horses in <lb/>
            this manner, the march of the whole troop will be uniform, <lb/>
            and even the very neighing and snorting of the horses will be <note type="footnote"> 1 This attitude is known to modern horsemen by the term pesade. <lb/>
            Berenger. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Commanders of cavalry. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Schneider supposes the words in brackets to be a gloss thaat has crept <lb/>
            into the text. </note> <pb n="299"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="§ 1—5.]"/> <lb/>
            in concert, so that not only the commander himself, but the <lb/>
            whole troop, will present an admirable spectacle.</p>
          <p>13. If a person be fortunate in purchasing horses, and bring <lb/>
            them up to be able to endure fatigue, and train them properly, <lb/>
            not only in exercises for war, but in manoeuvres for parade, <lb/>
            and in service in the field, what can prevent him, unless some <lb/>
            god be adverse to his endeavours, from rendering his horses of <lb/>
            far greater value than they were when be took them under <lb/>
            his care, or from having not only estimable horses, but being <lb/>
            himself greatly admired for his skill in the art of horseman­ <lb/>

            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Of a horseman's armour and arms.</p>
          <p>i. WE wish also to show how he should be armed who pre <lb/>
            pares to encounter danger on horseback.</p>
          <p>In the first place, then, we say that his coat of mail should <lb/>
            be made to suit his body ; because the whole of the body sup­ <lb/>
            ports one that fits well, but the shoulders only support one that <lb/>
            is too loose; and one that is too tight is a prison, and not a <lb/>
            coat of defence. 2. Since the neck, too, is one of the vital <lb/>
            parts, we think that a covering should be made for it of the <lb/>
            same shape with the neck, rising from the coat of mail; for it <lb/>
            will not only be an ornament, but, if it be made as it ought to <lb/>
            be, will cover the face of the rider, if he wishes, up to the <lb/>
            nose.</p>
          <p>3. As for the helmet, we consider that which is of Bœotian <lb/>
            manufacture to be the best; for it protects most effectually <lb/>
            all the parts above the corslet, and yet does not prevent the <lb/>
            wearer from seeing.</p>
          <p>The coat of mail, again, should be made in such a way that <lb/>
            it may not prevent the horseman from sitting or stooping. <lb/>
            4. About the abdomen, too, and the parts below and around, <lb/>
            there should be skirts of such a description and size as to pro­ <lb/>
            tect the limbs.</p>
          <p>5. Since, also, if the left hand should be hurt, it disables <lb/>
            the rider, we recommend the armour which has been invented <pb n="300"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[CH. 12."/> <lb/>
            for it, and which is called the hand; for it protects the shoulder, <lb/>
            the upper part of the arm, the elbow, and the portion of the <lb/>
            arm next to the bridle, and can be either expanded or con­ <lb/>
            tracted ; and it also covers the part under the arm which is <lb/>
            left unguarded by the coat of mail.</p>
          <p>6. The right hand a rider must raise, when he wishes either <lb/>
            to hurl a weapon or to strike a blow. Whatever portion of <lb/>
            the coat of mail, therefore, would obstruct it, must be removed ; <lb/>
            and if in its place a sort of flaps with joints be put, they will, <lb/>
            when the arm is raised, unfold at the same time, and, when it <lb/>
            is let down, will close.</p>
          <p>7. As to the right arm, that sort of defence which is put on <lb/>
            it like greaves on the leg appears to us to be better adapted <lb/>
            for protecting it than that which is attached to the coat of <lb/>
            mail; and the part of the arm which is exposed when the <lb/>
            right hand is lifted up must be defended near the coat of <lb/>
            mail, with a covering made of calf's skin or of brass; other­ <lb/>
            wise it will be left unguarded in a most dangerous place.</p>
          <p>8. Since, too, if the horse is disabled, the rider will be in <lb/>
            extreme peril, it is necessary to arm the horse also with de­ <lb/>
            fences for his head, his breast, and his shoulders; for these <lb/>
            assist likewise in guarding the rider's thighs. But of all parts <lb/>
            of the horse we take most care to protect his belly, for it is at <lb/>
            once a most vital and a most defenceless part; but it is pos­ <lb/>
            sible to protect it by something connected with the housings.1</p>
          <p>9. It is necessary, too, that that which covers the horsed <lb/>
            back should be put together in such a way that the rider may <lb/>
            have a firmer seat,2 and that the back of the horse may not be <lb/>
            galled. As to other parts, also, both horse and horseman <lb/>
            should be armed with the same precaution.3</p>
          <p>10. The legs and feet will naturally hang down below the <lb/>
            covering of the thighs; but these parts may be sufficiently <lb/>
            protected, if a sort of boots be constructed for them of the <lb/>
            leather of which sandals are made; for such boots may be at <lb/>
            once armour for the legs and shoes for the feet.</p>
          <p>11. Such is the armour that may prove, if the gods be pro­ <lb/>
            pitious, a defence against harm. But to inflict injury on an <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δυνατὸν δὲ σὺν τῳ̃ έφιππείω</foreign> avrov <foreign xml:lang="grc">σκεπάσαι</foreign>.] " 11 est possible de <lb/>

            enemy, we recommend the short curved sword rather than the <lb/>
            long straight one; for from a horseman, seated aloft, a blow <lb/>
            from a scymitar will be more effective than one from a straight <lb/>
            sword. 12. Instead of a reed-like spear, as it is weak and <lb/>
            inconvenient to carry, we rather approve of two javelins of <lb/>
            corneil wood; for a skilful thrower may hurl one of these, <lb/>
            and use the other against assailants either in front, or flank, <lb/>
            or rear.1 They are at once stronger than a spear, and more <lb/>
            easily carried.</p>
          <p>13. We approve of the hurling of a javelin from a great <lb/>
            distance; for by that means more time is allowed for throw­ <lb/>
            ing it2 and for taking another weapon. We shall intimate in <lb/>
            a few words how the javelin may be hurled with the greatest <lb/>
            effect. If the rider advance his left side, at the same time <lb/>
            drawing back his right, and rising on his thighs, and launch <lb/>
            his weapon with its point directed a little upwards, he will <lb/>
            thus send it with the greatest force and to the greatest dis­ <lb/>
            tance ; and he will send it with the truest aim, if the point, as <lb/>
            it is discharged, is directed steadily to the mark.</p>
          <p>14. Let these admonitions, and instructions, and exercises <lb/>
            be considered sufficient to be prescribed for a private individual. <lb/>
            What it is proper for a commander of cavalry to know and to <lb/>
            do, is set forth in another treatise. <note type="footnote"> 1 Dindorf retains in his text <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰς τοὒμπροσθεν</foreign>, though Leunclavius and <lb/>

          <p>THE object of this treatise is to show how a commander of the <lb/>
            Athenian cavalry may maintain them at the proper number; how <lb/>
            they may be suitably equipped; and how he may employ them <lb/>
            with the greatest efficiency.</p>
          <p>It is addressed to some one person. Camerarius supposes that <lb/>
            it was written for the instruction of Xenophon's son Gryllus, who <lb/>
            afterwards served in the Athenian cavalry, and whom, he thinks, <lb/>
            his father wished to qualify for a commander. Weiske is inclined <lb/>
            to favour Camerarius's opinion.</p>
          <p>There were two hipparchs, or chief commanders of the cavalry <lb/>

          <p>Summary of the duties of a commander-in-chief of the cavalry, § 1—9. How <lb/>
            he may keep his men and horses in an efficient and serviceable condition, <lb/>
            and render the inferior officers well qualified for their duties, 10—26.</p>
          <p>1. FIRST of all, it is incumbent on you to offer sacrifice, and <lb/>
            to entreat the gods to grant you to think, and say, and do <lb/>
            those things by which you may exercise your command most <lb/>
            agreeably to them, and with the greatest pleasure, and honour, <lb/>
            and benefit to yourself, your friends, and your country.</p>
          <p>2. When the gods are propitiated, you must prepare your <lb/>
            cavalry,1 taking care that the number 2 prescribed by law <note type="footnote">1 '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αναβιβαστέον μέν σοι ἰππέας</foreign>.] '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αναιβάζειν</foreign> is here used for pa­ <lb/>
            rare, legere, constituere, " to prepare, choose, appoint." Weiske. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Xenophon seems to mean a thousand; see c. 9, sect 3. This is the </note> <pb n="303"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="§ 3—8.]"/> <lb/>
            may be completed, and that the force previously enrolled may <lb/>
            not be diminished ; for, unless new horsemen are added, <lb/>
            the number will constantly grow less, as some must retire <lb/>
            from old age, and some must fail from other causes.</p>
          <p>3. After the complement is made up, you must take care <lb/>
            that the horses may be fed in such a way as to be able to en­ <lb/>
            dure exertion ; for horses that are too weak for their work <lb/>
            will be unable either to overtake an enemy or to retreat. <lb/>
            You must make it an object of your attention, too, that they <lb/>
            may be fit for service ; for such as are unmanageable are <lb/>
            an aid to the enemy rather than to their friends. 4. Such as kick <lb/>
            when they are mounted, also, must be set aside ; for they often <lb/>
            inflict more mischief on their own side than the enemy inflict. <lb/>
            You must pay attention to their feet also, that they may be in <lb/>
            a condition to be ridden even on rough ground, knowing that <lb/>
            when they suffer from being ridden they become useless.</p>
          <p>5. When you have your horses in proper condition, you <lb/>
            must next exercise your men ; in the first place, that they <lb/>
            may be well able to vault on their horses, for by that means <lb/>
            safety has been secured by many ; and in the second, that <lb/>
            they may be qualified to ride over every kind of ground, as the <lb/>
            enemy will be at different times in different places. 6. When <lb/>
            they are able to sit firm, you must see that they exercise <lb/>
            themselves, as much as possible, in throwing javelins on horse­ <lb/>
            back, and that they qualify themselves to do everything that <lb/>
            cavalry ought to do.</p>
          <p>After this, you must arm both your horses and their riders <lb/>
            in such a manner that they may be least likely to be wounded, <lb/>
            and may be able to do the greatest possible harm to the <lb/>
            enemy.</p>
          <p>7. In the next place, you must make it your care that your <lb/>
            men may be obedient; for without obedience there will be no <lb/>
            profit either in good horses, or in firm-seated riders, or in <lb/>
            fine arms.</p>
          <p>In regard to all these things, then, it is right that a com­ <lb/>
            mander of cavalry should give authoritative directions, in order <lb/>
            that they may be properly done.</p>
          <p>. 8. But since the state, thinking it difficult for the corn­ <note type="footnote">number of knights, or persons of sufficient means to maintain a horse for <lb/>
            the public service, mentioned by Aristophanes, Eq. 225. See Boeckh's <lb/>
            Pub. Econ. of Athens, vol. i. p. 352. </note> <pb n="304"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[CH. 1."/> <lb/>
            mander of the cavalry to accomplish all these objects with­ <lb/>
            out assistance, appoints him the phylarchs1 as coadjutors, and <lb/>
            enjoins the senate to support him by giving their attention to <lb/>
            the cavalry, it appears to me of great importance that you <lb/>
            should prepare the phylarchs to study what is for the advan­ <lb/>
            tage of the cavalry as well as yourself, and that you should <lb/>
            secure able speakers in the senate, who may, by their remarks, <lb/>
            keep the cavalry in awe (for under the influence of fear they <lb/>
            will attend to their duties better), and who may pacify the <lb/>
            senate, should they show any unreasonable displeasure.</p>
          <p>9. These are suggestions as to the duties to which you <lb/>
            must attend. How each of them may be best discharged I <lb/>
            will now endeavour to show.</p>
          <p>Into the cavalry, then, it is evident that you must bring, <lb/>
            according to the law, such of the citizens as are in the best <lb/>
            condition as to pecuniary means and as to bodily strength, <lb/>
            either by calling them before the judges or by persuading <lb/>
            them. 10. Before the judges I think that you must summon <lb/>
            those, whom if you were not to summon, you would be thought <lb/>
            to abstain from doing so from regard to your interest; for <lb/>
            those of inferior means would at once have a ground of excuse, <lb/>
            if you should forbear to coerce the most able first of all. <lb/>
            11. As for the young, you seem likely, in my opinion, to <lb/>
            animate them with a desire for cavalry service, if you enlarge <lb/>
            to them on the opportunities for distinction in the cavalry ; and <lb/>
            you will be likely to find less opposition from those 2 who have <lb/>
            authority over them, if you represent to them that they will <lb/>
            be obliged, if not by you, at least by some one else,3 to main­ <lb/>
            tain a horse on account of their fortune ; 12. but that, if their <lb/>
            sons engage in the cavalry under you, you will restrain them <lb/>
            from expensive and unreasonable purchasing of horses, and <lb/>
            will make it your care that they shall soon become able horse­ <lb/>
            men ; and while you say this, you must study to do it.</p>
          <p>13. As for those who are in the cavalry service at present, it <lb/>
            appears to me that the senate, if they were to give notice that <lb/>
            the equestrian exercise will in future be doubled, and that <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φυλάρχους</foreign>.] The phylarchs were captains of tribes, of which, after <lb/>
            the time of Cleisthenes, B. c. 510, there were ten at Athens. Comp. <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="§ 14—18.]"/> <lb/>
            they will reject the horses that cannot keep up with the others, <lb/>
            would excite them to feed their horses better, and to pay them <lb/>
            more attention. 14. It seems to me very proper, also, that <lb/>
            an announcement should be made that all unruly horses will <lb/>
            be rejected ; for a threat of that kind would stimulate the <lb/>
            owners of such horses to sell them, and purchase others with <lb/>
            greater judgment. 15. It would be well, too, for notice to be <lb/>
            given that horses apt to kick during exercise will be reject­ <lb/>
            ed ; for it is impossible to range horses of that description in <lb/>
            proper order, and, whenever an advance is to be made upon <lb/>
            the enemy, they will of necessity follow in the rear; so that <lb/>
            the rider may be rendered useless by the inefficiency of his <lb/>
            horse.</p>
          <p>16. For keeping the feet of the horses in the best condition,1 <lb/>
            if any one has an easier and cheaper method than mine, let it <lb/>
            be adopted ; if not, I recommend, from experience, that the <lb/>
            horseman should scatter over the ground stones gathered from <lb/>
            the road, of about a pound weight, more or less, and that he <lb/>
            should keep the horse standing on such stones while he grooms <lb/>
            him, and let him walk upon them whenever he goes out of the <lb/>
            stable ; for thus the horse will be constantly moving his feet <lb/>
            on the stones, as well when he is rubbed down as when he is <lb/>
            annoyed by flies. He that makes trial of this suggestion <lb/>
            will give credit to others which I shall offer, and will see the <lb/>
            feet of his horse become firm.</p>
          <p>17. I shall next show how, when the horses are brought <lb/>
            into the condition in which they ought to be, the riders may <lb/>
            be best trained. The younger of them I should advise to learn <lb/>
            to vault upon their horses ; and if you assign them a person to <lb/>
            teach them, you will justly gain praise for doing so. The <lb/>
            older you may accustom to be mounted with the aid of others, <lb/>
            after the Persian manner,3 and may thus be of great service <lb/>
            to them. is. To lead out the cavalry frequently, however, <lb/>
            in order that they may be qualified to keep their seats on every <lb/>
            sort of ground, may perhaps appear, when there is no war, <lb/>
            somewhat troublesome ; but it will be proper to call the horse <note type="footnote">1 See the Treatise on Horsemanship, c. 4, sect. 5. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Στρογγύλους</foreign>.] By this word is meant something similar to what is <lb/>
            signified by the Latin teres, round, smooth, of a proper shape, indicating <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [CH. 1. </note> <lb/>
            men together, and to advise them to exercise themselves, and <lb/>
            then ride out into the country, or anywhere else, to quit the <lb/>
            beaten road, and to gallop their horses over ground of all <lb/>
            sorts ; for this will be of much the same use as to lead them <lb/>
            out, and will cause them less annoyance. 19. It will be useful, <lb/>
            to remind them, too, that the state supports an expenditure of <lb/>
            nearly forty talents a year for the cavalry, in order that, if <lb/>
            war arise, they may not have to seek cavalry, but may make <lb/>
            use of that which they have at once, as being in proper con­ <lb/>
            dition ; for it is natural that the soldiers, reflecting on this <lb/>
            expense, should apply to their exercise with greater diligence, <lb/>
            in order that, if war should break out, they may not have to <lb/>
            contend, without due preparation, for their country, for glory, <lb/>
            an d for life.</p>
          <p>20. It will be well for you also to announce to the men, that <lb/>
            you will take them out yourself on certain occasions, and will <lb/>
            lead them over ground of every description. In exercises, too, <lb/>
            for mock combats, it will be proper to lead them out to differ­ <lb/>
            ent places at different times ; for such charges will be more <lb/>
            beneficial both to the riders and to their horses.</p>
          <p>21. As for javelin-throwing on horseback, the greatest <lb/>
            number seem to me likely to be induced to practise it, if you give <lb/>
            notice to the phylarchs that they will be required to lead out <lb/>
            the javelin-throwers of their several tribes to exercise them­ <lb/>
            selves with the javelin ; for they will thus be induced by <lb/>
            ambition, as is probable, to produce respectively as many <lb/>
            javelin-throwers as possible for the service of the state.</p>
          <p>22. The phylarchs, too, appear to me likely to contribute <lb/>
            most to the horsemen being well armed, if they be persuaded <lb/>
            that it will be much more honourable, in the opinion of the <lb/>
            state, that they should be adorned by the splendour of their <lb/>
            several tribes than merely by their own equipments. 23. It is <lb/>
            probable that they will not be difficult of persuasion as to such <lb/>
            points, as they sought the command in their tribes from <lb/>
            desire of distinction and honour ; and they will be able, too, <lb/>
            to have their men armed according to law, without incurring <lb/>
            any personal expense, by obliging them to equip themselves, <lb/>
            as the law directs, out of their own pay.</p>
          <p>24. To render the men obedient, it is important to represent. <lb/>
            in your addresses to them, how many advantages there are in <lb/>
            submitting to orders; and it is of great effect to arrange things <pb n="307"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 1, 2.] </note> <lb/>
            go in practice that the orderly may gain something by their <lb/>
            good conduct, and the disorderly be in every respect the losers.</p>
          <p>25. But the strongest incitement to the phylarchs to be am­ <lb/>
            bitious to bring the men of their several tribes well equipped <lb/>
            into the field appears to me to be, that you should adorn your <lb/>
            staff-officers 1 about you with arms in the highest degree <lb/>
            splendid, and oblige them to exercise themselves in throwing <lb/>
            the javelin as frequently as possible, leading them yourself to <lb/>
            trials of skill at that weapon, having previously acquired suf­ <lb/>
            ficient skill in throwing it yourself. 26. If any one could offer <lb/>
            prizes, moreover, to the several tribes, for excellence in whatever <lb/>
            is commonly practised by cavalry on public occasions, I think <lb/>
            that such a proposal would have the greatest effect in excit­ <lb/>
            ing the Athenians in general to emulation. It is seen in the <lb/>
            case of the choruses how much labour is endured, and how <lb/>
            much money expended, to obtain very small prizes. You <lb/>
            should take care, however, to secure judges by whom the can­ <lb/>
            didates will be best pleased to be pronounced conquerors.</p>

          <p>Of the order to be observed by the cavalry on different occasions.</p>
          <p>1. WHEN your cavalry are well exercised in all these par­ <lb/>
            ticulars, they ought next to be taught a certain order, by <lb/>
            observing which they may march in processions at the feast <lb/>
            of the gods with the greatest precision, may perform their <lb/>
            evolutions with the best effect, may fight, if it be necessary, <lb/>
            with the greatest success, and may pursue their marches and <lb/>
            make their way over obstacles with the utmost ease and the <lb/>
            least possible confusion. What order they may adopt, so as <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τοὐς ἀμφι σὲ προδρόμους</foreign>.] Weiske very properly supposes that <lb/>
            these <foreign xml:lang="grc">προδρόμοι</foreign> were turma quædam prætoriana, a corps of officers whom <lb/>
            the hipparchus might despatch with orders, or send on before him on <lb/>
            any commission; or they may have been so called because they rode be­ <lb/>
            fore the hipparch. They were distinct from the <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόοδοι</foreign> mentioned in <unclear/>. <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [CH. 2. </note> <lb/>
            to be likely to accomplish these objects most effectually, I <lb/>
            shall now endeavour to show.</p>
          <p>2. Distinct tribes, then, are appointed by the state. Among <lb/>
            these I think that you ought first of all to appoint, with the <lb/>
            approbation of each of the phylarchs, captains of ten, selected <lb/>
            from the citizens in the vigour of youth, and such as are most <lb/>
            ambitious to do something honourable and obtain praise. <lb/>
            These you ought to place in the first rank in each ten. 3. In the <lb/>
            next place, you ought to choose an equal number of the oldest <lb/>
            and wisest, who may hold the last rank in the ten; for, if I <lb/>
            may illustrate my meaning by a comparison, iron penetrates <lb/>
            into iron best when the fore part of the cutting instrument is <lb/>
            strong, and the hinder part urged with competent force. 4. As <lb/>
            to those who are placed in the middle between the first and <lb/>
            the last, if the captains of the tens choose those who are to <lb/>
            stand next to them, and the others choose others in like man­ <lb/>
            ner, it is likely that each will have a sufficiently trustworthy <lb/>
            supporter. 5. For the leader of each tribe,1 you ought by all <lb/>
            means to appoint an able man; for, if he is brave, he will, <lb/>
            whenever he is to march against the enemy, inspire those in <lb/>
            front with ardour by his exhortations; or, if circumstances re­ <lb/>
            quire him to retreat, he will be more likely, by drawing off his <lb/>
            troop judiciously, to preserve the men of his tribe. 6. If the <lb/>
            captains of ten, again, are of an even number,2 they will afford <lb/>
            facilities for dividing them into more equal parts than if they <lb/>
            be of an odd number.</p>
          <p>This arrangement pleases me for these reasons, that, in the <lb/>
            first place, all those in the first rank are officers, and men <lb/>
            when they are in command think it more incumbent on them to <lb/>
            do something honourable than when they are mere privates ; <lb/>
            and, secondly, that when anything is to be done, an order has <lb/>
            far more effect when it comes, not from privates, but from <lb/>
            officers.</p>
          <p>7. When this order is established, then, as the place of the <lb/>
            phylarchs, in which each of them is to ride, is appointed by <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τὸν ἀφηγούμενον</foreign>.] Weiske considers that the phylarch is meant, anu <lb/>
            Schneider agrees with him. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Xenophon recommends that the number of the captains of ten should <lb/>
            be an even number, that it may be more easily divided into severa. <lb/>
            smaller parts or numbers, to each of which some office or honour may be <lb/>
            assigned. Schneider </note> <pb n="309"/>
            <note type="margin"> § 8, 9.] </note> <lb/>
            the commander-in-chief, so the places for the captains of tens, <lb/>
            where they are severally to march, must be appointed by the <lb/>
            captains of tribes; for, when such appointments are made, <lb/>
            things will be in far better order than if they run against <lb/>
            one another, going wherever chance may lead them, like people <lb/>
            coming out of a theatre. 8. Those in the first rank, too, will <lb/>
            be more disposed to fight, if any opposition appear in front of <lb/>
            them, when they know that the front is their proper place ; and <lb/>
            those in the rear, if an enemy appears behind them, will be <lb/>
            more ready to exert themselves, as they know that it will be a <lb/>
            disgrace to them to leave their post. 9. But if they are without <lb/>
            any regular order, they throw one another into confusion in <lb/>
            defiles and passages of rivers, and no one of his own accord <lb/>
            takes a post in face of the enemy.</p>
          <p>All these particulars ought to be carefully studied by the <lb/>
            cavalry universally, if they would be staunch supporters to <lb/>
            their leader.</p>

            <title type="sub">CHAPTER III.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Of the various exercises and evolutions of the cavalry.</p>
          <p>1. THE following matters must be the business of the com­ <lb/>
            mander-in-chief alone.1 First, that he may obtain favourable <lb/>
            omens from the gods, on behalf of the cavalry, by offering <lb/>
            sacrifices; next, that he may render the processions, on festal <lb/>
            occasions, worthy of being seen; and, in addition, that he <lb/>
            may exhibit whatever spectacles he has to produce for the <lb/>
            public in the best possible manner, whether in the Academia, <lb/>
            in the Lyceum, the Phaleron,2 or the Hippodrome. The latter <lb/>
            will form subjects for particular admonitions. But how each <lb/>
            of these general divisions may be best ordered, I shall here <lb/>
            attempt to show.</p>
          <p>2. As to the processions, then, I think that they may be <lb/>
            rendered most acceptable, as well to the gods as to the specta- <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Λὐτῳ̃</foreign>.] In the sense of soli, " alone." Weiske. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Phaleron, or the Phaleron, was both a harbour, or dockyard, and a <lb/>
            demus of Athens. It is the harbour, says Sturz, that is meant here., </note> <pb n="310"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[ CH. 3."/> <lb/>
            tors, if, whatever deities have temples and statues in the forum, <lb/>
            the cavalry should march round to those statues and temples, <lb/>
            beginning with those of Hermes, and circumambulating the <lb/>
            forum in honour of those deities. At the festival of Bacchus, <lb/>
            the choruses offer homage, by their dancing, to other gods <lb/>
            besides the twelve. When they have ridden round, and <lb/>
            have come to the statues of Hermes again, it seems to me <lb/>
            that it will be well for them to ride their horses at a quick <lb/>
            pace from thence, one tribe after another, to the temple of <lb/>
            Eleusinian Ceres.</p>
          <p>3. Nor will I omit to mention how their lances may be car­ <lb/>
            ried so as least to interfere one with another; for each man <lb/>
            should hold his lance between the ears of his horse, if the <lb/>
            weapons are to look formidable and distinct, and at the same <lb/>
            time to present the appearance of a multitude,</p>
          <p>4. When they have made an end of riding at a quick pace, <lb/>
            it will be proper for them to ride steadily back, at the other <lb/>
            pace,1 by the same route as before, to the temples again; and <lb/>
            thus whatever manoeuvres are performed on mounted horses <lb/>
            will have been fully displayed both to gods and men.</p>
          <p>5. That the cavalry are not accustomed to these perform­ <lb/>
            ances I am well aware; but I think that they will be be­ <lb/>
            coming and attractive, and afford pleasure to the spectators. <lb/>
            I find also that the cavalry have executed other new evolu­ <lb/>
            tions, when their commanders-in-chief were able to prevail on <lb/>
            them to do what they wished.</p>
          <p>6. When they ride in the Lyceum, before they engage in <lb/>
            throwing the javelin, it will be well for the tribes to ride <lb/>
            five on each side with an extended front,2 as if prepared for <lb/>
            battle, with the commander-in-chief and the captains of the <lb/>
            tribes at their head, in such array as to cover the whole <lb/>
            breadth of the course. 7. But when they have passed the ex­ <lb/>
            tremity3 of the theatre opposite to them,4 I think it will be a <lb/>
            fine sight, if you show that the cavalry can ride at a quick <lb/>
            pace down the steep, as many abreast as is suitable for the <lb/>
            ground. 8. Nor am I ignorant that they will perform this <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τὴν</foreign> Understand <foreign xml:lang="grc">διέλασιν</foreign>. Schneider. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Επὶ του̃ μετώπου</foreign>.] With the front of each troop much extended, the <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="§ 9-12.]"/> <lb/>
            duty with the greatest pleasure, if they but feel confident that <lb/>
            they will be able to ride fast; but if they remain unexercised <lb/>
            in this respect, you will have to take care lest the enemy may <lb/>
            at some time force them to practise it.</p>
          <p>9. The order has now been stated1 in which, in the exercises <lb/>
            for approval,2 the cavalry may ride with the best effect. But <lb/>
            Jf the leader, provided that he have a strong horse, constantly <lb/>
            rides round about3 on the outside rank, he will thus continu­ <lb/>
            ally ride at a quick pace himself, and those who are on the <lb/>
            outside with him will ride at a quick pace in their turn, so <lb/>
            that the senate4 will always have before them the portion <lb/>
            which is advancing rapidly, and the horses will not be wearied, <lb/>
            as they will rest in succession.</p>
          <p>10. But when the exhibition is to be made in the hippo­ <lb/>
            drome, it will be well to arrange the cavalry, at first, in such -a <lb/>
            manner that they may cover the hippodrome with the extent <lb/>
            of their line, and clear all the people from the midst of it. <lb/>
            11. It will be proper, too, when the tribes in the mock com­ <lb/>
            bats5 pursue and flee from one another at full speed, and <lb/>
            when the officers are at the head of the five tribes,6 that the <lb/>
            tribes on either side should ride through the spaces between <lb/>
            the other tribes; for in such a spectacle, when they ride front <lb/>
            to front against each other, there is something that produces <lb/>
            awe, and something imposing when, after having ridden over <lb/>
            the hippodrome, they assume a position facing one another; <lb/>
            and it is a noble sight, when, at the next sound of the trum­ <lb/>
            pet, they ride towards one another with increased speed. <lb/>
            12. When they have come to a stand again, they must rush <lb/>
            a third time, at the sound of the trumpet, towards one another <lb/>
            at their utmost speed ; and, when they have ridden their course, <lb/>
            they must, to bring the spectacle to a conclusion, form in one <note type="footnote"> 1 I suppose in c. 2. Weiske. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 'Ev <foreign xml:lang="grc">ται̃ς δοκιμασίαις</foreign>.] " Aux évolutions d'epreuve " Gail. There <lb/>

            body, and, as is your custom, ride forwards towards the senate, <lb/>
            13. Such evolutions would appear to me to present something <lb/>
            more warlike, and something more novel, than is usual; but <lb/>
            for a commander-in-chief to ride slower than the captains of <lb/>
            tribes, or to manoeuvre exactly in the same manner as they, is <lb/>
            unbecoming his office.</p>
          <p>14. When you have to exhibit the cavalry in the Academia, <lb/>
            however, on hard ground,1 I would offer the following hints <lb/>
            for your observation : that the men, to secure themselves from <lb/>
            falling off their horses, should lean back as they ride, and <lb/>
            that, to prevent the horses from falling, they should keep up <lb/>
            their heads with the bridle whenever they wheel round. <lb/>
            When they ride straight forward, however, they ought to <lb/>
            ride at a quick pace, for thus the senate will have before them <lb/>
            an exhibition free from danger and of great attraction.</p>

          <p>Of the mode of marching in time of war, § 1—5. How to act cautiously <lb/>
            and efficiently with a small force, 6—20.</p>
          <p>1. ON marches, the commander of cavalry ought constantly <lb/>
            to consider how he may give rest to the backs of his horses, <lb/>
            and afford relief to the riders as they proceed,2 whether by <lb/>
            riding at a moderate pace, or by dismounting and walking at <lb/>
            a moderate pace. In maintaining this moderate pace you will <lb/>
            not fail, if you pay proper attention to the matter ; for every <lb/>
            man can judge from himself, so as not to be unaware when <lb/>
            others are over-fatigued. 2. When, however, you are march­ <lb/>
            ing to any particular place, and it is uncertain whether you <note type="footnote"> 1 'Ev <foreign xml:lang="grc">τω̃ ἐπεκρότῳ</foreign>, in solo duro, is the reading adopted by Dindorf and <lb/>
            Sauppe. Most editions have <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀποκότῳ</foreign>, " steep.” But Xenophon was <lb/>
            previously speaking, says Sauppe, of sandy ground; now he speaks of <lb/>
            harder ground. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αναπαύη</foreign>] <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοὺς ἰππέας του̃ βαδίζειν</foreign>.] Properly, " relieve the riders," <lb/>

            fatigue on the march. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Βαδίζειν</foreign> here means " proceeding on horseback," <lb/>
            not " on foot," as Sturz imagines. </note> <pb n="313"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="§ 3-7.]"/> <lb/>
            may fall in with the enemy, you must let the tribes rest only <lb/>
            in turns, for it would be dangerous if the enemy should come <lb/>
            upon you when all your men are dismounted. 3. If, again, <lb/>
            you have to march through narrow passes, you must lead on <lb/>
            your men, at the word of command, in single file ; if you come <lb/>
            into broad roads, you must, at the word of command, extend <lb/>
            the front of each tribe ; and when you come forth into open <lb/>
            plains, you must form all the tribes in a solid body ; for it is <lb/>
            vvell to execute these movements even for the sake of exercise, <lb/>
            and it is more agreeable, as you pursue your route, to vary <lb/>
            the modes of marching in the different companies.</p>
          <p>4. When you march out of the beaten road, and over diffi­ <lb/>
            cult ground, it will be very proper, not only in a hostile but <lb/>
            in a friendly country, that some of the inferior officers should <lb/>
            ride on in advance of each tribe ; who, if they meet with im­ <lb/>
            passable woods, may seek unobstructed ways, and point out <lb/>
            to the rest of the cavalry where they must direct their march, <lb/>
            so that whole companies may not stray from one another. 5. <lb/>
            If you march in expectation of encountering dangers, it is the <lb/>
            part of a prudent commander to see that extraordinary scouts <lb/>
            go before the ordinary ones to ascertain the position of the <lb/>
            enemy. It is proper, also, both with reference to attacking <lb/>
            and for keeping on guard, that at the crossing of rivers the <lb/>
            soldiers should wait for one another, that those who get over <lb/>
            last may not fatigue their horses by hastening after their <lb/>
            leader. Almost all officers know the propriety of this, but <lb/>
            there are not many willing to take the trouble of constantly <lb/>
            attending to it.</p>
          <p>6. It is the duty of a commander of cavalry in time of peace, <lb/>
            also, to study to acquire an exact knowledge, as well of the <lb/>
            enemy's country, as of his own ; and if he cannot obtain such <lb/>
            knowledge personally, he may keep about him men that are <lb/>
            well acquainted with the several parts of both countries ; for <lb/>
            a leader who knows the roads is a totally different person from <lb/>
            one who is ignorant of them ; and, in forming plans against <lb/>
            the enemy, he who has a knowledge of the country has a vast <lb/>
            advantage over him who is a stranger to it. 7. When you <lb/>
            are procuring spies, too, before a war is actually begun, you <lb/>
            ought to take care that they may be taken from towns friendly <lb/>
            to both parties, and from merchants ; for all towns receive as <lb/>
            friends those who bring anything with them; and such persons <pb n="314"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[CH. 4."/> <lb/>
            are sometimes useful as pretended deserters. 8. You ought never <lb/>
            to trust to your spies, however, so far as to neglect to keep on <lb/>
            your guard, but you should always be as well prepared as if <lb/>
            the enemy were reported to be approaching; for however trust­ <lb/>
            worthy the spies may be, it may be difficult for them to bring <lb/>
            information in time, since many obstacles occur in war.</p>
          <p>9. The enemy will be least likely to observe the march of <lb/>
            cavalry out of the camp, if it be conducted by notice commu­ <lb/>
            nicated from man to man rather than by announcement made by <lb/>
            a herald or by a written order.1 Besides leading out the troops, <lb/>
            too, by notice from man to man, it will be proper to appoint <lb/>
            captains of ten, and captains of five under the captains of ten, <lb/>
            that each may have to give orders to as few as possible, and <lb/>
            also that the captains of five may extend the front of the <lb/>
            troop by bringing forward their men, as they may do without <lb/>
            confusion, whenever there is occasion.</p>
          <p>10. Whenever it is necessary to guard against surprise, I <lb/>
            always recommend watches to beset, and sentinels to be posted, <lb/>
            with secrecy; for thus, while they are a security to their friends, <lb/>
            they are rendered as it were an ambush for the enemy. 11. The <lb/>
            watch themselves, too, when they are concealed, are less liable <lb/>
            to surprise, and much more to be dreaded by the enemy ; for <lb/>
            though the enemy may know that there are advanced guards <lb/>
            somewhere, yet, if they know not where they are, or what is <lb/>
            their number, their ignorance deprives them of all feeling of <lb/>
            security, and compels them to regard every spot with suspicion ; <lb/>
            while guards posted openly show them at once what they have <lb/>
            to fear, and how far they may be free from apprehension. 12. He <lb/>
            also that has parties on guard posted secretly, will be able, by <lb/>
            sending out a small party openly in. advance of those that are <lb/>
            concealed, to endeavour to draw the enemy into an ambush. <lb/>
            Another way of occasionally surprising the enemy, also, is to <lb/>
            post parties that are visible behind those that are concealed; <lb/>
            and this may be as effective in deceiving an antagonist as the <lb/>
            method previously mentioned. 13. It is indeed the part of a <lb/>
            prudent commander never to expose himself to danger, except <lb/>
            when he has previously made it clear that he will have the ad­ <lb/>
            vantage over his adversaries. But for him to offer favourable <lb/>
            opportunities of which the enemy may take advantage,2 may <note type="footnote">1 Which must be read aloud to the men. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Tb <foreign xml:lang="grc">δὲ ὑπηρετει̃ν τὰ ἥδιστα τοι̃ς πολεμίοις</foreign>.] This is the case when an </note> <pb n="315"/>

            be justly considered rather a betrayal of his party,l than a <lb/>
            display of fortitude. 14. It is judicious, moreover, to make <lb/>
            an attack on the enemy in the part where he is weakest, though <lb/>
            that part may be at some distance; for to endure the fatigue <lb/>
            of a long march is less dangerous than to contend against a <lb/>
            superior force, is. Should the enemy advance between two <lb/>
            fortified places that are friendly to you, it will be well, even <lb/>
            though they are far superior to you in number, to attack them <lb/>
            on that wing on which you may approach them unobserved ; <lb/>
            or it will be well even to attack them on both wings at once ; <lb/>
            for, whenever one of your parties has to retire,2 the other, <lb/>
            riding up on the opposite side, may throw the enemy into <lb/>
            confusion and assist in bringing off their friends.</p>
          <p>16. That it is proper to endeavour to learn the state of the <lb/>
            enemy's affairs by means of scouts, has been long ago said;3 <lb/>
            but I think it best of all for the general himself to watch the <lb/>
            enemy, if he can, from some safe position, and observe whether <lb/>
            they commit any error. IT. Whatever may be taken from <lb/>
            them secretly, too, it is well to send a competent detachment <lb/>
            to bring off; and whatever can be snatched from them openly, <lb/>
            it is proper to despatch troops openly to seize.</p>
          <p>If, again, when the enemy are on the march, any part of <lb/>
            their force, weaker than your own, is detached from the main <lb/>
            body, or strays from it through too great self-confidence, you <lb/>
            must not fail to take advantage of such an opportunity ; but <lb/>
            you must always take care to pursue such weaker body with <lb/>

          <p>Of contrivances for deceiving the enemy,</p>
          <p>1. A MAN who has the charge of cavalry ought also to <lb/>
            know in what distance a horse can overtake a person on foot, <lb/>
            and at what distance slow horses may escape from such as are <lb/>
            swifter.2 It becomes a commander of cavalry to understand, <lb/>
            too, on what kinds of ground foot are preferable to horse, and <lb/>
            when horse are preferable to foot. 2. He should be fertile <lb/>
            also in contrivances, and know how to make a small body of <lb/>
            cavalry appear large, and a large one appear but small; how <lb/>
            to make the enemy imagine that he is absent when he is pre­ <lb/>
            sent, and present when he is absent; and how, not only to <lb/>
            conceal the state of things among the enemy from his own <lb/>
            men, but, by concealing the movements of his own men from <lb/>
            the enemy, to attack them unawares. It is an excellent arti­ <lb/>
            fice, also, to contrive, when you are weaker than the enemy, <lb/>
            to strike terror into them, that they may not attack you; and, <lb/>
            when you are stronger, to create a false confidence in them, <lb/>
            that they may come to a battle; for thus you yourself are <note type="footnote"> 1 ‛<foreign xml:lang="grc">´Οταν</foreign>—<foreign xml:lang="grc">φυλακη̃ς παταφρονήσωσι</foreign>.] When the wolves think lightly of <lb/>

            least likely to suffer loss, and are in the best condition to take <lb/>
            advantage of any error on the part of the enemy.</p>
          <p>3. That I may not be thought to prescribe what is impossi­ <lb/>
            ble, I will explain how that which appears most difficult in <lb/>
            such proceedings may be accomplished. 4. Security from <lb/>
            failure, then, when attempting to pursue or retreat, a know­ <lb/>
            ledge of the strength of his horses will give. But how can <lb/>
            he obtain this knowledge ? By observing, in the mock fights <lb/>
            during peace, how the horses hold out in pursuit and re­ <lb/>
            treat. 5. When you wish your cavalry to appear numerous, <lb/>
            let it be your first consideration whether there be a fair <lb/>
            opportunity for doing so, that you may not attempt to deceive <lb/>
            the enemy when you are close upon them; for it is safer <lb/>
            to try such deceit at a distance, and it is more likely to be <lb/>
            successful. You must then bear in mind that horses appear <lb/>
            numerous when they are in a close body, on account of the <lb/>
            size of the animal, but that, when they are scattered about, <lb/>
            they are easily counted. 6. Your cavalry may also be made <lb/>
            to appear more numerous than they are, if you station the <lb/>
            grooms1 between the horsemen, holding spears, if possible, or, <lb/>
            if not, something resembling spears, in their hands; and this <lb/>
            you may do whether you exhibit the cavalry standing still, or <lb/>
            whether you are leading it along, for the mass of a troop <lb/>
            must thus always appear greater and denser. 7. Should you, <lb/>
            on the other hand, wish a large number to seem small, it is <lb/>
            plain that, if there be grounds at hand to admit of conceal­ <lb/>
            ment, you may keep some of your men on the open parts, and <lb/>
            place others out of sight, and thus disguise their number ; but <lb/>
            if the country is entirely open, you must range your men by <lb/>
            tens in single file,2 and lead them on with an interval between <lb/>
            the files, and you must make the men of each ten immediately <lb/>
            in front of the enemy hold their lances erect, while the rest <lb/>
            keep them down and out of sight. 8. To alarm the enemy <lb/>
            you may adopt pretended ambuscades, may feign to send suc­ <lb/>
            cour to this or that quarter, or may circulate false reports. <lb/>
            The enemy, however, are always boldest when they hear that <lb/>
            their adversaries have plenty of trouble or occupation. <note type="footnote"> 1 Every horse-soldier seems to have had his <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἱππόκομος</foreign>, or groom, with <lb/>

          <p><note type="margin"> [CH. 5. </note> 9. Having laid down tkese precepts, I shall add that a <lb/>
            commander ought always to be on the alert to deceive the <lb/>
            enemy, so as to take advantage of present circumstances; for <lb/>
            in reality nothing is more useful in war than deceit. 10. And <lb/>
            when even children, as they play at guessing numbers,1 are <lb/>
            able to deceive by making pretences, so that, when they have <lb/>
            but few, they may appear to have many, and, when they <lb/>
            bring forward many, may appear to have but few, how can it <lb/>
            be impossible for men, when they apply their minds to de­ <lb/>
            ceive, to be able to contrive similar stratagems? 11. If a <lb/>
            person reflects upon the various advantages that have been <lb/>
            obtained in wars, he will find that the most and greatest have <lb/>
            been obtained by stratagems. For which reason a man must <lb/>
            either never attempt to be a commander, or he must suppli­ <lb/>
            cate the gods that he may be able to unite this accomplish­ <lb/>
            ment with others, and he himself must strive to excel in it.</p>
          <p>12. For commanders who have sea at hand, it is an excel­ <lb/>
            lent mode of deceiving the enemy, to seem to be fitting out <lb/>
            ships, and in the mean time to carry into execution some <lb/>
            enterprise by land, or, while they pretend to be forming de­ <lb/>
            signs by land, to make some attempt by sea.</p>
          <p>13. It is the duty of a commander of cavalry, too, to impress <lb/>
            upon the state how weak cavalry is, when unsupported by <lb/>
            infantry, against an enemy that has cavalry united with his <lb/>
            infantry. It is the duty also of a commander of cavalry, <lb/>
            when he has infantry given him, to use them with effect. He <lb/>
            may conceal his infantry, too, not only among his cavalry, but <note type="footnote">1 "Orav <foreign xml:lang="grc">παίζωσι ποσίνδα</foreign>.] Quoties ludunt in numero divinando, is the <lb/>

            behind them; for a horseman obstructs the view far more <lb/>
            than a foot soldier. 14. But all such stratagems, and what­ <lb/>
            ever others he may contrive in addition to them, when he <lb/>
            wishes to get the advantage of the enemy either by force or <lb/>
            by art, I recommend him to try only under the favour of the <lb/>
            gods, so that, when the gods are propitious, fortune may be <lb/>
            on his side.</p>
          <p>15. It is sometimes an effectual mode of deceit to make it <lb/>
            appear that ycu are extremely cautious, and utterly averse to <lb/>
            risk; for this often leads the enemy to be less on their guard, <lb/>
            and to commit more mistakes. On the other hand, if a com­ <lb/>
            mander appears on some occasions to be venturesome, he may, <lb/>
            even while he continues quiet, yet feigns to be preparing for <lb/>

          <p>How a leader may secure the respect and affection of his men.</p>
          <p>i. BUT no workman can fashion anything as he wishes <lb/>
            unless the materials from which he has to fashion it be pre­ <lb/>
            pared to his hand, so that they may obey his pleasure; nor <lb/>
            can a commander do what he pleases with men, unless they <lb/>
            be so disposed, with the help of the gods, as to have a friend­ <lb/>
            ly feeling towards him, and a conviction that he has more <lb/>

            friendly feeling it is likely that the troops will entertain to­ <lb/>

            they may have provisions, may retire to a secure camp, and <lb/>
            rest under a sufficient guard. 3. In the field1 he must let it <lb/>
            be seen that he pays attention to the fodder for the horses, <lb/>
            the tents, the water, the posting of sentinels, and all other <lb/>
            necessary matters, exercising his forethought, and even de­ <lb/>
            priving himself of sleep, for the good of those under his com­ <lb/>

            to do better than they. 5. Beginning, therefore, with the <lb/>
            mounting of their horses, he ought to exercise them in every <lb/>
            sort of equestrian accomplishment, that they may see that <lb/>
            their leader is able to cross ditches on horseback with safety, <lb/>
            to leap over walls, to jump down from heights, and to throw <lb/>
            his javelin efficiently; for all such qualifications contribute to <lb/>
            protect him from being undervalued. 6. If they feel assured, <lb/>
            too, that he is skilful in directing affairs, and able to secure <lb/>
            them advantages over the enemy ; if they are impressed also <lb/>
            with the belief that he will not lead them against the enemy <lb/>
            rashly, or without the approbation of the gods, or in oppo­ <lb/>
            sition to the auspices; all such feelings will render troops <lb/>

            bordering on his country who have as many cavalry as him­ <lb/>
            self, and a large force of heavy-armed infantry. 2. Should he <lb/>
            then attempt to invade the enemy's country without the sup­ <lb/>
            port of the other troops of the state, he would have to main­ <lb/>
            tain a perilous contest against the enemy's cavalry and in­ <lb/>
            fantry with his cavalry only. Should the enemy, on the other <lb/>
            hand, invade the country of the Athenians, they would not come, <lb/>
            in the first place, without other cavalry united with their own, <lb/>
            and, in the second place, without such a number of infantry <lb/>
            that they would consider all the Athenians together unable to <note type="footnote"> 1 The Thebans. See sect 3, fin. </note> <pb n="321"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="§ 3—6.]"/> <lb/>
            oppose them in the field. 3. If, however, the whole people should <lb/>
            go forth against such an enemy, with a resolution to defend <lb/>
            their territory, favourable hopes might be entertained ; for the <lb/>
            cavalry, if their commander pays due attention to them, will <lb/>
            be, with the help of the gods, superior to those of the enemy; <lb/>
            the infantry will not be inferior to theirs in number, nor will <lb/>
            they have the disadvantage in bodily strength, while in their <lb/>
            minds they will be even more ambitious of distinction, if, un­ <lb/>
            der the favour of the gods, they be properly exercised. On <lb/>
            their ancestors, certainly, the Athenians pride themselves no <lb/>
            less than the Bœotians. 4. But should the people turn their <lb/>
            thoughts towards the sea, and think it sufficient to save merely <lb/>
            their walls, as at the time when the Lacedæmonians invaded the <lb/>
            country in conjunction with all the other Greeks,' and should <lb/>
            they appoint the cavalry to defend the parts outside the walls, <lb/>
            and to hazard a contest, themselves alone, against all the in­ <lb/>
            vaders, I think that in that case there would be need, above <lb/>
            all, of powerful support from the gods, and that it will be <lb/>
            proper, in addition, for the commander of the cavalry to be an <lb/>
            extremely accomplished leader ; for he will require great <lb/>
            judgment to act against an enemy far more numerous than his <lb/>
            own troops, and great boldness to take advantage of an oppor­ <lb/>
            tunity whenever one may present itself.</p>
          <p>5. It is necessary also, as it appears to me, that he should <lb/>
            be able to sustain personal fatigue ;2 for otherwise, having to <lb/>
            contend at his peril with an army before him, to which not <lb/>
            even the whole state would be willing to oppose itself, it is <lb/>
            evident that he would have to submit to whatever those <lb/>
            stronger than himself chose to impose upon him, and would be <lb/>
            able to make not even a semblance of defence. 6. But if he <lb/>
            should protect the grounds without the walls, with such a <lb/>
            number of men as would suffice to watch the motions of the <lb/>
            enemy, and be able to retreat into a place of safety after <lb/>
            having observed whatever might be requisite,3 (and a small <lb/>
            number may be not less able to reconnoitre than a larger one,) <note type="footnote">1 In the time of Pericles, at the commencement of the Peloponnesian <lb/>

            and those who are too timid to trust either to themselves or <lb/>
            their horses may be as well qualified for going out to watch, <lb/>
            and returning to their friends, as others, (for fear appears to <lb/>
            be a powerful incentive to keeping guard), and a commander <lb/>
            might perhaps accordingly decide rightly in taking guards <lb/>
            from these; but if, when he has with him those who are not <lb/>
            wanted for the guard, he considers that he has an army, it <lb/>
            will certainly appear to him but a small one, for it will be alto­ <lb/>
            gether too weak to make head against the enemy in the field. <lb/>
            But if he employs them as flying parties, he may find their <lb/>
            force, as it would appear, quite sufficient for that duty. It <lb/>
            behoves him, however, as it seems to me, to keep his men 1 <lb/>
            always ready for action, and to be on the watch for any secret <lb/>
            movement of the enemy's army, in case that they should be <lb/>
            guilty of any error. 9. The more numerous an army is, in­ <lb/>
            deed, the more faults the men are accustomed to commit; for <lb/>
            they either scatter themselves about for the purpose of getting <lb/>
            provisions,2 or, marching with too little regard to order, some <lb/>
            go before, and others fall behind, farther than is proper. <lb/>
            10. Such negligences you should not suffer to be committed <lb/>
            with impunity, (for if you do so, the whole country will be one <lb/>
            camp,)3 taking good care, however, if you undertake any expe­ <lb/>
            dition, to make a hasty retreat before the great body of the <lb/>
            enemy can come to the aid of their party.</p>
          <p>11. An army on the march often comes into roads in which <lb/>
            a large number of men can do no more than a small one ; and <lb/>
            at the crossings of the rivers it is possible for a commander <lb/>
            who is on the alert, and who pursues with caution, to manage <lb/>
            in such a manner that he may attack as many of his adver­ <lb/>
            saries at once as he pleases. 12. Sometimes it is advantageous, <lb/>
            too, to make attacks on the enemy when they are at their <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τοὺς παρεσκευασμένους</foreign>.] Weiske very justly supposes that some <lb/>

            morning or evening meal, or when they are rising from their <lb/>
            beds; for at all such times the troops are unarmed, the in­ <lb/>
            fantry for a shorter, and the cavalry for a longer time. <lb/>
            is. On their sentinels and outposts you should never cease to <lb/>
            make attempts ; for these are always few in number, and are <lb/>
            sometimes stationed far away from the main body. 14. Should <lb/>
            the enemy guard such posts well, it will not be amiss to pass <lb/>
            them secretly, and penetrate into the enemy's ground, relying <lb/>
            on the support of the gods, and after having first ascertained <lb/>
            what force is at each station, and the exact spots where they <lb/>
            are placed; for no prize is so honourable as the capture of an <lb/>
            enemy's advanced guard. 15. Guards, indeed, are very easily <lb/>
            deceived; since they are ready to pursue whatever small force <lb/>
            they see, imagining that this is a part of their duty. You <lb/>
            must have a care, however, as to the direction of your retreat, <lb/>
            that it may not be on that side where the enemy will come to <lb/>

          <p>Further admonitions on the same subject.</p>
          <p>.1 THOSE, however, who would be able to annoy a much <lb/>
            stronger army than their own, ought to have so much the ad­ <lb/>
            vantage over their enemies in military skill, that they them­ <lb/>
            selves may appear accomplished in all kinds of equestrian ex­ <lb/>
            ercises, and their adversaries utterly unpractised in them. <lb/>
            2. The first requisite to this is, that those who are to engage <lb/>
            in predatory excursions should be so inured to the fatigue of <lb/>
            riding, that they may be prepared to endure every sort of <lb/>
            military exertion; for horses and men that are unaccustomed <lb/>
            to such duty would appear like women going to fight against <lb/>
            men. 3. But those who are taught and accustomed to leap <lb/>
            across ditches, to vault over walls, to spring up on eminences, <lb/>
            to descend from them with safety, and to ride at full speed <lb/>
            down steep grounds, will have as much advantage over those <lb/>
            who arc unpractised in such exercises as winged animals have <lb/>
            over those that can only walk. Those, again, whose feet are <pb n="324"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[CH. 8."/> <lb/>
            hardened with exercise will be as superior on rough ground <lb/>
            to those who are not habituated to it, as persons who are <lb/>
            sound in their limbs are to those who are lame; and those <lb/>
            who are acquainted with the face of a country will as much sur­ <lb/>
            pass those who are unacquainted with it, in advancing and re­ <lb/>
            treating, as those who have sight would surpass the blind. 4. A <lb/>
            commander should understand, moreover, that horses in good <lb/>
            condition are such as are well fed, but at the same time exer­ <lb/>
            cised so effectually that they will not lose their wind under <lb/>
            fatigue. And as bits and housings for horses can be useful <lb/>
            only when they are fitted with straps, a commander of cavalry <lb/>
            should never be without straps ; for he may at a small expense <lb/>
            put those who are in want of them in an efficient con­ <lb/>
            dition.</p>
          <p>5. Should any officer think that he shall have too much <lb/>
            trouble if he must thus exercise his cavalry, let him reflect <lb/>
            that those who exercise themselves in gymnastic games un­ <lb/>
            dergo far greater labour and trouble than those who practise <lb/>
            equestrian exercises to the utmost degree; for the greater <lb/>
            part of gymnastic exercises are performed with extreme ex­ <lb/>
            ertion, but most of those of an equestrian kind with pleasure. <lb/>
            6. Should a man pray, indeed, to become a winged animal, <lb/>
            there is no human accomplishment that would bring him so <lb/>
            near to the object of his wishes as horsemanship. 7. To gain <lb/>
            a victory in the field of battle is far more glorious than to gain <lb/>
            one in a pugilistic contest; for the state has a share in such <lb/>
            honour,1 and it is through success in war that the gods, for <lb/>
            the most part, crown communities with prosperity; so that I <lb/>
            know not why it is proper to practise any kind of exercises <lb/>
            more than those of a warlike nature. 8. We may consider, <lb/>
            also, that it is only through being inured to toil that the pi­ <lb/>
            rates are enabled to live on the property of those who are far <lb/>
            stronger then themselves. On land, too, it is not the part of <lb/>
            those who reap the fruit of their own grounds, but of those <lb/>
            who are in want of sustenance, to commit depredations on <lb/>
            others; for they must either cultivate the ground themselves, <note type="footnote">1 That is, the honour of victory in the field of battle. But the state <lb/>
            had also some credit from gymnastic victories, as Schneider observes; and <lb/>
            he therefore thinks that something is wrong in the text. The reader of <lb/>
            the original will observe that <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐδαιμονίᾳ</foreign>, a little below, is to be taken <lb/>
            with <foreign xml:lang="grc">στεφανου̃σιν</foreign>, as the dative of the instrument. </note> <pb n="325"/>

            or live on the produce of the labour of others, since by no other <lb/>
            means is it possible either to secure life or enjoy peace.1</p>
          <p>9. You must likewise bear in mind that you must never, <lb/>
            when you make an attack with cavalry on a superior force, <lb/>
            leave any ground behind you which is difficult for the horses <lb/>
            to cross; for to be unhorsed is far more perilous to him who <lb/>
            is retreating than to him who is pursuing.</p>
          <p>10. I would wish to remind you, also, that you ought to be <lb/>
            very cautious in the following respects; for there are some <lb/>
            commanders who, when they are going against an enemy td <lb/>
            whom they think themselves superior, set out with a very <lb/>
            small force, so that they often suffer what they hoped to in­ <lb/>
            flict; and, when they proceed against an enemy to whom they <lb/>
            are quite certain that they are inferior, they take with them <lb/>
            all the troops that they can command. 11. But I am of opin­ <lb/>
            ion that you ought to act in a quite contrary manner; when a <lb/>
            commander leads out his troops in the expectation that he <lb/>
            shall conquer, I think that he should not spare his force, <lb/>
            whatever he has ; for to have obtained an overwhelming vic­ <lb/>
            tory has never been a cause of repentance to any leader. 12. But <lb/>
            when he makes an attempt upon an enemy far superior in <lb/>
            number, and foresees that, after doing his utmost, he will still <lb/>
            be obliged to retreat, I assert that, in such a case, it is much <lb/>
            better for him to lead a few of his men, than the whole of <lb/>
            them, to the charge, but that he should take the flower of his <lb/>
            force, the best of his men, and the best of his horses; for, <lb/>
            being of that description, they will be able to execute any <lb/>
            enterprise, and secure a retreat, with most safety. 13. But <lb/>
            when he leads all his force against a superior enemy, and <lb/>
            wishes to retreat, it must happen that those who are on the <lb/>
            slowest horses will be overtaken, while others will fall off from <lb/>
            unskilfulness in riding, and others will be intercepted through <lb/>
            the difficulties of the ground; for it is hard to find any large <lb/>
            extent of ground exactly such as you would wish. 14. They <lb/>
            may also, from being numerous, run against each other, impede <lb/>
            one another's progress, and do much damage. But good <lb/>
            horses and men will be able to escape from the hands of the <note type="footnote"> 1The reader may perhaps think the examples in this section somewhat <lb/>
            objectionable; but they are intended to show the necessity of military <lb/>
            exercises and qualifications, if we would be in a condition to defend our­ <lb/>
            selves against our neighbours. </note> <pb n="326"/>
            <note type="margin"> [ CH. 8. </note> <lb/>
            enemy,I especially if the commander contrive to threaten the <lb/>
            pursuers with that portion of his cavalry that has remained <lb/>
            behind. 15. For this purpose, pretended ambushes are ser­ <lb/>
            viceable ; and it will be useful for him also to discover at what <lb/>
            point some of his own party may show themselves with safety <lb/>
            so as to retard the course of the pursuers. 16. It is manifest, <lb/>
            too, that where exertion and expedition are required, a smaller <lb/>
            number will have the advantage over a larger, rather than a <lb/>
            larger over a smaller; not that I say that the smaller number <lb/>
            will be more efficient and expeditious because it is smaller, <lb/>
            but that it is easier to find a small number who will take care <lb/>
            of themselves and their horses, and who will practise horse­ <lb/>
            manship with skill, than a large one.</p>
          <p>17. If it even happen that a commander has to contend <lb/>
            with a body of cavalry exactly equal in number to his own, <lb/>
            I think that it will not be amiss for him to form two troops <lb/>
            out of each tribe, of which the phylarch may command <lb/>
            one, and the other whosoever appears best qualified. is. <lb/>
            The latter leader may follow with his troop, for a time, at the <lb/>
            rear of the troop under the phylarch; and when the enemy <lb/>
            come close up, he may, at the word of command, ride forward <lb/>
            to attack them; for by this method I think that they will <lb/>
            cause more alarm to the enemy, and will be more difficult to <lb/>
            withstand. 19. Should both the leaders also have infantry <lb/>
            with them, and should these be concealed behind the cavalry, <lb/>
            and, discovering themselves suddenly, close with the enemy, <lb/>
            they seem likely to contribute much more by that means to <lb/>
            secure a victory; for I see that what is unexpected, if it be <lb/>
            good, gives people much more pleasure, and, if it is something <lb/>
            formidable, causes them much more alarm. 20. This any per­ <lb/>
            son may very well understand, who reflects how much those <lb/>
            are startled that fall into an ambuscade, even though they be <lb/>
            much superior in numbers; and how much greater terror, <lb/>
            when two armies are encamped opposite to one another, is <lb/>
            felt during the first days after their meeting. 21. To order <lb/>
            these matters, however, is not difficult; but to secure men who <lb/>
            will act against the enemy with prudence, fidelity, zeal, and <lb/>
            courage, requires great ability in a commander ; 22. for he <note type="footnote"> 1 ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Εξ αὐτω̃ν</foreign>.] Weiske suspects .hat <foreign xml:lang="grc">χειρω̃ν</foreign>, or some such word, has <lb/>

            ought to be qualified to speak and to act in such a manner <lb/>
            that those who are under his command may feel convinced <lb/>
            that it is advantageous for them to obey him, to follow him as <lb/>
            their leader, and to engage the enemy under his direction, <lb/>
            and that they may feel a desire for praise, and a resolution <lb/>
            to persevere in whatever course they adopt.</p>
          <p>23. If, on any occasion, when two camps lie face to face, <lb/>
            or two fortresses belonging to the opposite parties, there occur <lb/>

            cavalry in the space between them, both parties are for the <lb/>
            most part accustomed, in such cases, to advance slowly on re­ <lb/>
            turning to a charge, and then to ride over the intermediate <lb/>
            space at full speed. 24. But if any commander, letting it be <lb/>
            supposed that he will act thus, nevertheless, on wheeling <lb/>
            about, charges with speed and retires with speed, he may <lb/>
            thus, as is apparent, do most damage to the enemy, and con­ <lb/>
            sult best for his own safety, riding forward quickly while <lb/>
            he is near the strength of his own side, and retreating quickly <lb/>
            from before the strength of the enemy. 25. If he could con­ <lb/>
            trive to leave unobserved,3 too, four or five of the best horses <lb/>
            and men of each troop, they would be of great weight in <lb/>
            charging the enemy as they are returning to the attack.</p>

          <p>Concluding remarks.</p>
          <p>1. As to reading these precepts, it will be sufficient for a <lb/>
            commander to peruse them but a very few times; but, in <lb/>
            action, he ought to be constantly ready to take advantage of <lb/>
            whatever opportunity may occur, and, looking to that which <lb/>
            offers itself, to work out that which is expedient. To com­ <lb/>
            mit to writing everything that he ought to do is no more pos- <note type="footnote"> I ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αναστροφαί</foreign>.] A word used of those who, after fleeing before an <lb/>

            sible than to know everything that will happen. 2. Of all ad­ <lb/>
            monitions, however, the best seems to me to be, that whatever <lb/>
            he discovers to be advantageous, he should take care that it <lb/>
            be carried into execution; for neither in agriculture, nor in <lb/>
            navigation, nor in military management, does accurate know­ <lb/>
            ledge produce any effect, unless the possessor of it takes care <lb/>
            that it be carried into practice.</p>
          <p>3. I give it as my opinion, however, that the whole body <lb/>
            of cavalry may, with the assistance of the gods, be kept up to <lb/>
            the number of a thousand1 with greater expedition, and with <lb/>
            much more ease to the citizens, if they should admit two <lb/>
            hundred foreign soldiers as mercenaries; as these, if united <lb/>
            with the rest, seem likely to render the whole of the cavalry <lb/>
            more obedient2 and more emulous of one another in valour ; <lb/>
            for I know that the cavalry of the Lacedæmonians began to <lb/>
            be distinguished when they admitted foreigners into it. 4. <lb/>
            I see that in other states too, in all countries, foreign soldiers <lb/>
            are held in much esteem; for necessity excites great zeal.3</p>
          <p>5. For purchasing horses I consider that the citizens may <lb/>
            secure funds from those who are strongly averse to cavalry <lb/>
            service, (for persons of that character, on whom that service <lb/>
            falls, will be willing to pay the cavalry-tax that they may be <lb/>
            exempt from it,) and from other persons that are rich, but too <lb/>
            weak for bodily exertion ; and I think that contributions <lb/>
            might be exacted from orphans4 that have estates able to pay. <lb/>
            6. I am of opinion also, that if some of the metœcs were re­ <lb/>
            ceived into the cavalry, they would show a desire for distinc­ <lb/>
            tion ; for I see that in regard to other honours, of which the <lb/>
            citizens allow them a share, some of them are ready, from a <lb/>
            love of praise, to do whatever is required of them.</p>
          <p>7. Infantry, too, in union with the cavalry, appears to me <lb/>
            likely to be of great service, if it be composed of men de­ <lb/>
            termined to act against the enemy.5 All these advantages <lb/>
            may be secured with the aid of the gods. <note type="footnote">1 See c. i. sect, 2. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 More ready to obey the orders of the general, when they see the <lb/>

            we must proceed WITH THE AID OF THE GODS, let him be <lb/>
            assured that he will feel less surprise at this admonition, if he <lb/>
            fall often into danger, and if he reflect that in time of war <lb/>
            enemies often form designs on one another, but seldom know <lb/>
            the state of things among the party against whom their de­ <lb/>
            signs are formed. 9. Such being the case, it is impossible to <lb/>
            find to whom we may apply for counsel, except to the gods, <lb/>
            who know all things, and who give intimations to whomsoever <lb/>
            they please, by sacrifices, auguries, omens, and dreams. But <lb/>
            it is probable that the gods will be more willing to afford <lb/>
            counsel to those who not only ask them what they are to do <lb/>
            when they need advice, but pay them honour, as far as they <lb/>
            can. in time of success.</p>

          </head>
          <p>AT what period of his life Xenophon wrote this piece is uncer­ <lb/>
            tain, except that we may suppose it to have been written some <lb/>
            time after his return from Asia with the Ten Thousand.</p>
          <p>Valckenaer, De Aristobulo, p. 114, cited by Schneider, suspects <lb/>
            that the catalogue of mythological and other personages in the <lb/>
            first chapter, who are said to have profited so much by devotion to <lb/>
            hunting, can scarcely be all genuine. To this suspicion Schneider <lb/>
            was very ready to listen. But there is far more ground for <lb/>
            believing that the thirteenth chapter, which consists chiefly of a <lb/>
            series of weak and foolish assaults on the sophists, is spurious. <lb/>
            Both the matter, and the manner in which it is expressed, are utterly <lb/>
            unworthy of Xenophon. The rest of the work, though Schneider <lb/>
            has some suspicion of the twelfth chapter, is probably genuine.</p>
          <p>The first part, as far as the end of the eighth chapter, treats mostly <lb/>
            of hare-hunting, and with such a thorough acquaintance with <lb/>
            the subject, that Blane, hitherto the only English translator of the <lb/>
            work, who, being a sportsman, deserves attention, says, " I have <lb/>
            been indeed astonished; in reading the Cynegeticos of Xenophon, <lb/>
            to find the accurate knowledge that great man had of the <lb/>
            nature of the hare, and the method of hunting her; and to <lb/>
            observe one of the finest writers, the bravest soldiers, the ablest <lb/>
            politicians, the wisest philosophers, and the most virtuous citizens <lb/>
            of antiquity, so intimately acquainted with all the niceties and <lb/>
            difficulties of pursuing this little animal, and describing them with <lb/>
            a precision that would not disgrace the oldest sportsman of Great <lb/>
            Britain, who never had any other idea interfere to perplex his <lb/>
            researches."</p>
          <p>The rest of the treatise speaks of the hunting of deer, boars, <lb/>
            and other larger beasts. His description of a snare for entangling <lb/>
            the feet of deer, in the ninth chapter, is to us of modern days <lb/>
            very obscure.</p>

          </head>
          <p>Praise of hunting, as having its origin from the gods, and as having been of <lb/>
            advantage to many eminent men who have cultivated it.</p>
          <p>1. THE invention of the art is from the gods ; for hunting <lb/>
            and dogs were the care of Apollo and Diana, who rewarded <lb/>
            and honoured Chiron with a knowledge of them on account of <lb/>
            his regard for justice. 2. He, having received the gift, was <lb/>
            delighted with it, and had as disciples, in this and other <lb/>
            honourable pursuits, Cephalus, Æsculapius, Melanion, Nestor, <lb/>
            Amphiaraus, Peleus, Telamon, Meleager, Theseus, Hippoly­ <lb/>
            tus, Palamedes, Ulysses, Menestheus, Diomede, Castor, Pollux, <lb/>
            Machaon, Podalirius, Antilochus, Æneas, Achilles; each of <lb/>
            whom, in his own day, received honour from the gods.</p>
          <p>3. Nor let any one wonder that most of them, though they <lb/>
            pleased the deities, nevertheless died ; (for this nature de­ <lb/>
            mands; but their great praises have been perpetuated ;) nor <lb/>
            let any one feel surprised that their lives were not all of the <lb/>
            same duration, since the life of Chiron was long enough for <lb/>
            all of them.1 4. Jupiter and Chiron were brothers, sons of <lb/>
            the same father ; but Jupiter had Rhea for his mother, and <lb/>
            Chiron a Naiad nymph ; so that he was born before all of <lb/>
            them, but did not die till he had brought up Achilles.</p>
          <p>5. From their attention to dogs and hunting, and from their <lb/>
            other accomplishments, they were admired as greatly excel­ <lb/>
            ling in merit. 6. Cephalus was carried off by a goddess ; 2 <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πα̃σιν ἐζήρκει</foreign>.] He lived so long that he was able to instruct them <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[CH. 1."/> <lb/>
            Æsculapius obtained higher distinction, that of raising the <lb/>
            dead and healing the sick ; and for these powers he receives <lb/>
            immortal glory as a god among mortals. 7. Melanion attained <lb/>
            such renown in bodily exercises, that he alone was deemed <lb/>
            worthy of the high honour of a marriage with Atalanta, for <lb/>
            which the most eminent men of that period were his rivals. <lb/>
            The merit of Nestor has already pervaded the ears of the <lb/>
            Greeks ; so that, if I were to speak of it, I should speak to <lb/>
            those who are well acquainted with it. 8. Amphiaraus, when <lb/>
            he proceeded against Thebes, obtained the greatest praise, <lb/>
            and received from the gods the honour of living for ever. <lb/>
            Peleus inspired the gods with the desire of giving him Thetis <lb/>
            in marriage, and of celebrating the marriage at the dwelling of <lb/>
            Chiron. 9. Telamon became so eminent that he married <lb/>
            Peribœa, the daughter of Alcathous, a native of the greatest <lb/>
            of cities,1 whom he courted ; and when Hercules, the chief of <lb/>
            the Greeks, distributed the prizes of valour after he had taken <lb/>
            Troy, he assigned to him Hesione. 10. The honours which <lb/>
            Meleager received are well known ; and that he fell into mis­ <lb/>
            fortunes in his old age was not through his own fault, but <lb/>
            through his father's forgetfulness of the goddess.2 Theseus <lb/>
            alone overthrew the enemies of all Greece; and, having <lb/>
            greatly increased the power of his country, is held in honour <lb/>
            even in the present day. 11. Hippolytus was honoured by <lb/>
            Diana, and celebrated by general report, and died in happy <lb/>
            estimation for his temperance and piety. Palamedes, as long <lb/>
            as he lived, far surpassed the men of his age in wisdom ; and, <lb/>
            after being put to death unjustly, obtained more honour from <lb/>
            the gods than any other among mortals. But he was not put <lb/>
            to death by those by whom some suppose that he was; for it <lb/>
            could not have been one who was almost the best of men, and <lb/>
            another 4 who was of a character with the good ; but it was <lb/>
            assuredly bad men that did the deed.</p>
          <p>12. Menestheus, from his devotion to hunting, so far sur­ <lb/>
            passed other men in endurance of toil, that the first among <lb/>
            the Greeks acknowledged themselves inferior to him in mill. <lb/>
            tary affairs, except Nestor alone ; and he indeed is not said to <lb/>
            have excelled, but to have rivalled him. 13. Ulysses and <note type="footnote"> I Fr. Portus supposes that Elis is meant; Brodæus, Athens. Bro­ <lb/>

            Diornede were distinguished on particular occasions, and were <lb/>
            on the whole the authors of the reduction of Troy. Castor <lb/>
            and Pollux, through the esteem which they acquired from <lb/>
            exhibiting in Greece such of the accomplishments as they <lb/>
            learned from Chiron, are immortal. 14. Machaon and Poda­ <lb/>
            lirius, who were instructed in all the same accomplishments, <lb/>
            were excellent in arts, and eloquence, and war. Antilochus, <lb/>
            by dying for his father,1 obtained such glory that he alone is <lb/>
            called by the Greeks Philopator. 15. Æneas, by preserving <lb/>
            his paternal and maternal gods,2 and by saving also the life of <lb/>
            his father, gained such renown for his filial piety, that the <lb/>
            Greeks granted to him alone, of all that they took prisoners <lb/>
            in Troy, exemption from being spoiled of his property. <lb/>
            16. Achilles, brought up in the same course of instruction, <lb/>
            raised such illustrious and extraordinary memorials of himself, <lb/>
            that no one is ever tired either of speaking or hearing con­ <lb/>
            cerning him.</p>
          <p>17. All these men became such as they were from the instruc­ <lb/>
            tion derived from Chiron ; men whom the good still love, and <lb/>
            the bad envy. If misfortunes happened, indeed, to any city <lb/>
            or ruler in Greece, they 3 became its deliverers ; or if a quarrel <lb/>
            or war arose between the whole of Greece and the barbarians,4 <lb/>

            the young not to despise hunting, or any part of liberal edu­ <lb/>
            cation ; for by such means men become excellent in military <lb/>
            qualifications, and in other accomplishments by which they <lb/>
            are necessarily led to think, act, and speak rightly. <note type="footnote"> I Defending his father against Memnon, by whom Antilochus himself <lb/>

          <p>Qualifications necessary in the hunter and his net-keeper. Description of <lb/>
            the nets to be used.</p>
          <p>1. IN the first place, then, it is proper for one who has <lb/>
            just passed the age of boyhood to devote himself to hunting, <lb/>
            and, in the next place, to other accomplishments; I mean, one <lb/>
            who has fortune ; but he must have regard to the extent of <lb/>
            it; he who has a competency should pursue such exercises <lb/>
            in proportion to the benefit which he may expect from them ; <lb/>
            he who has not, should at least show a desire for them, and <lb/>
            neglect no part of them that is within his means.</p>
          <p>2. With what preparations, and of what kind, he ought to <lb/>
            come to the pursuit of hunting, I will mention, as well as <lb/>
            what is necessary to be known in each particular matter, in <lb/>
            order that he may not enter on the occupation without some <lb/>
            previous instruction. Nor let any one imagine that the ad­ <lb/>
            monitions which I offer are trifling ; for without attention to <lb/>
            them nothing could be done.</p>
          <p>3. It is necessary, then, that he1 who has the care of the <lb/>
            nets should be fond of his employment, should speak the <lb/>
            Greek language, be about twenty years of age, active and <lb/>
            strong in body, and possessed of sufficient courage, in order <lb/>
            that, surmounting toil by means of these qualifications, he <lb/>
            may have pleasure in the occupation. 4. The small nets, <lb/>
            those for stopping roads, and the larger ones,2 should all be <lb/>
            made of fine flax from Phasis or Carthage. The nets should <lb/>
            also be made of cord of nine threads ; that is, of three strands, <lb/>
            and each strand of three threads; they should be five spans3 <note type="footnote"> I A slave who prepared the nets, and spread them. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Three kinds of nets are here mentioned by Xenophon, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄρκυες</foreign>, or <lb/>

            of cord of twelve threads, and the large nets of cord of six­ <lb/>

            thirty fathoms ; if they be larger, they will be difficult to <lb/>
            manage; both of them must have thirty knots,3 and the size <lb/>
            of the meshes must be the same as that of the meshes in the <lb/>
            smaller nets. Let the road-nets have round knots at the <lb/>
            upper extremities, and the larger nets rings; and the ropes4 <lb/>
            that run round them made of twisted cord. 7. Let the forked <lb/>
            props for the small nets be ten palms in length,5 some how­ <lb/>
            ever less; (let such of them as are of unequal length be used <lb/>
            on sloping grounds, that they may keep the tops of the nets <lb/>
            straight, while those of equal length may be used on level <lb/>
            ground;) they must allow the nets to be easily put off and <lb/>
            on, and must accordingly be smooth at the tips. Let those <lb/>
            for the road-nets be of twice that length, and those for the <lb/>
            large nets five spans in length, having small forks, with <lb/>
            notches by no means deep ;6 let them all be easy to fix, and <note type="footnote"> 1 The palm, four fingers' breadths, was about 3 inches. Xenophon <lb/>

            beginning with a knot at the corner of a half-mesh, the number of the <lb/>
            knots will be the same as that of the meshes. <lb/>

          <p>Of the two principal sorts of dogs, and their faults.</p>
          <p>1. OF dogs there are two kinds ; the one called Castorian, the <lb/>
            other of the fox breed.3 The Castorian have this appellation, <lb/>
            because Castor, who delighted in the amusement of hunting, <lb/>
            had most regard for them; those of the fox breed were so <lb/>
            termed because they are bred from a dog and a fox, and <lb/>
            through length of time the natures of the two animals are <lb/>
            completely amalgamated.</p>
          <p>2. The inferior animals of these two species,4 which are <lb/>
            also the more numerous, are of the following sorts: such as <lb/>
            are small, or have turned-up noses, are blue-eyed, near-sighted, <lb/>
            ill-shaped, stiff, weak, have thin hair, are long-legged, not well <lb/>
            proportioned, deficient in spirit or power of scent, or have bad <lb/>
            feet. 3. The small, from their diminutiveness, often find <note type="footnote">1 For the upper edge of the net, as Weiske remarks, will, if it be but <lb/>
            loosely stretched, sink down more than if it be tight, and will conse­ <lb/>
            quently require more props to keep it in a proper position. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Sacks or bags drawn together at the mouth with strings. Pollux, v. 31. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Weiske has a long Excursus on this passage, showing that there are more <lb/>
            than two kinds of dogs, and questioning whether a dog and a fox will breed. <lb/>
            John Hunter denied the possibility of it, as the dog and the fox are quite <lb/>
            different species of animals; Philosoph. Transact. vol. lxxvii. p. 24; <lb/>
            but he did not live to make the experiment which he intended. Pennant, <lb/>
            in his " Quadrupeds," and Daniel, in his " Field Sports," are inclined to <lb/>
            believe in the possibility, and each mentions a case, but not on his own <lb/>
            knowledge. Xenophon is speaking of the two kinds of dogs adapted for <lb/>
            hunting hares. Both were Spartan dogs. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Sauppe very justly observes that <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλείους</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοιαίδε</foreign> in the text refet <lb/>

            their efforts in the chase fruitless; those that have turned-up <lb/>
            noses are weak in the mouth, and are unable, for this reason, <lb/>
            to hold. the hare ; the near-sighted and blue-eyed are imper­ <lb/>
            feet in sight, as well as ill-shaped and unpleasing to the eye; <lb/>
            such as are stiff in the frame come off ill in the pursuit; <lb/>
            such as are weak, and have thin hair, are unfit to endure <lb/>
            fatigue ; such as are long-legged, and ill-proportioned, have <lb/>
            incompact frames, and run heavily ; such as are deficient in <lb/>
            spirit quit their work, shrink away from the heat of the sun <lb/>
            into the shade and lie down ; such as are wanting in scent <lb/>
            hardly ever find the hare ; and such as have bad feet are <lb/>
            unable, even if they are ever so spirited, to endure the exer­ <lb/>
            tion, but faint away from pain in the feet.</p>
          <p>4. Of tracking the hare there are many different modes <lb/>
            among the same dogs; for some, when they have found the <lb/>
            track, proceed onwards without giving any indication, so that <lb/>
            it is not known that they are on the track ; others merely <lb/>
            move their ears, and keep their tail perfectly still; other <lb/>
            keep their ears unmoved, but make a motion with the end of <lb/>
            their tail. 5. Some, again, contract their ears, and, looking <lb/>
            solemnly down on the track, pursue their way along it with <lb/>
            their tails lowered and drawn between their legs ;2- many do <lb/>
            none of these things, but run madly about the track when <lb/>
            they have fallen upon it, barking and trampling out the <lb/>
            scent in the most senseless manner. 6. Others, after making <lb/>
            many turnings and windings, and getting an inkling of the <lb/>
            scent in advance of the hare, leave her behind ; whenever they <lb/>
            run upon the track, they are never certain ; and, when they <lb/>
            see the hare before them, they give signs of fear, and do not <lb/>
            advance upon her until they see her start. 7. Whatever dogs, <lb/>
            again, in tracking and pursuing, run forward and watch fre­ <lb/>
            quently, at the same time, for what other dogs discover, have <lb/>
            no confidence in themselves. Some, on the other hand, are <lb/>
            so rash that they do not allow the experienced dogs of the <lb/>
            pack to precede them, but keep them back with a disturbing <lb/>
            noise. Others pounce on false scents, and, exulting in what­ <lb/>
            ever they find, take the lead at once, though conscious that <lb/>
            they are deceiving the rest; others do the same without being <note type="footnote"> 1 Fatigued and unsuccessful. Weiske. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Σχάσασαι τὴν ού̓ρὰν καὶ φραζασαι</foreign>.] Retrahentes caudam atque ini <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [CH. 3. </note> <lb/>
            conscious of it. Such dogs are worthless, too, as never leave <lb/>
            beaten tracks, and do not know the tracks proper to be fol­ <lb/>
            lowed. 8. Such dogs also as do not know the footstep3 <lb/>
            that lead to the hare's resting-place, and such as pass <lb/>
            hastily over those which she makes in running, are not of a <lb/>
            good breed.</p>
          <p>Some start in pursuit of the hare with great speed, but re­ <lb/>
            lax for want of spirit; some run on,1 and then miss the scent; <lb/>
            others run senselessly into the public roads, and so lose it, and <lb/>
            show the utmost reluctance to be recalled. Many, abandoning <lb/>
            the pursuit, turn back through dislike of the hare ; many, from <lb/>
            longing for the society of their master. Some try to draw <lb/>
            the other dogs from the track by yelping, making a false scent <lb/>
            appear to be the true.2 10. There are some also, which, though <lb/>
            they do not act thus, yet if, while they are running on, they <lb/>
            hear a noise on any side, quit their own course, and start off <lb/>
            foolishly towards it; for some run after anything in uncer­ <lb/>
            tainty, others fancying strongly that they are getting on a <lb/>
            track, others imagining they have found one ; some making a <lb/>
            feint, while others maliciously quit the scent, though they are <lb/>
            continually straying about close to it.</p>
          <p>11. Dogs that have such faults, most of them perhaps from <lb/>
            nature, but some from having been unskilfully trained, are of <lb/>
            little service. Such dogs, indeed, may disgust people with <lb/>
            hunting who have a strong turn for it. But of what descrip­ <lb/>
            tion dogs of this species3 ought to be, as to their shapes and <lb/>
            other qualities, I will now proceed to show. <note type="footnote"> I ‘<foreign xml:lang="grc">Υποθέουσι</foreign>.] " Run after other dogs." Leunclavius. " Cursu <lb/>

          <p>1. IN the first place, then, they ought to be large ; and,; in <lb/>
            the next, they should have their heads light, short, and sinewy; <lb/>
            the lower jaw muscular ; the eyes up-raised,1 black, and <lb/>
            bright; the face large and broad; the line dividing the eyes <lb/>
            deep; the ears small, thin, and without hair on the back ; the <lb/>
            neck long, flexible, and round ; the breast broad and not <lb/>
            without flesh ; the shoulder-blades standing out a little apart <lb/>
            from the shoulders;2 the fore-legs small, straight, round, wiry; <lb/>
            the knees straight ;3 the sides should not hang down very <lb/>
            deep, but run along obliquely;4 the loins should be fleshy <lb/>
            [their size a medium between long and short], and not too <lb/>
            soft or too hard ; the upper flanks something between large <lb/>
            and small; the hips should be round, fleshy towards the hinder <lb/>
            part, not drawn together at the upper,5 but closely joined <lb/>
            within ;6 the part below the flank, and the lower flank7 itself, <lb/>
            should be loose; the tail long, straight, sharp-pointed ; the <lb/>
            thighs firm ; the lower part of the thighs8 long, full, compact; <note type="footnote">1 Sint celsi vultus. Gratius, Cyneg. v. 269. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 " Let dogs have shoulders standing wide apart, not tied together, but <lb/>

            Xenophon, run parallel to the ground, but oblique to it, or forming an <lb/>
            angle with it. So Appian, I. 408, praises <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλευρὼν ἐπικἀρσια ταρσά</foreign>. Et <lb/>

            the hinder legs much longer than those in front, and some­ <lb/>
            what lean ; the feet round.'</p>
          <p>2. If the dogs be shaped thus, they will be strong, agile, <lb/>
            symmetrical, swift; will have pleasing looks and good mouths. <lb/>
            3. They must, as they seek for scent, be easily called off from <lb/>
            beaten tracks, sloping their heads down to the ground, looking <lb/>
            cheerfully as they come upon the track, hanging down their <lb/>
            ears, glancing quickly about with their eyes, and wagging <lb/>
            their -tails ; and thus let them proceed, with many windings, <lb/>
            along the track of the hare to the place where she lies. 4. <lb/>
            When they come near the hare, let them make the fact mani­ <lb/>
            fest to the huntsman by moving about more quickly, signify­ <lb/>
            ing it also by increased ardour, by the motion of their heads, <lb/>
            by their glances, by the change in their movements, by look­ <lb/>
            ing up, and looking onward to the seat of the hare, by jumping <lb/>
            forward, and backward, and sideways, and by showing that they <lb/>
            are really elated in their hearts, and rejoiced that they are close <lb/>
            upon the hare. 5. They should pursue vigorously, and never <lb/>
            relax, with great noise and barking, and turning in every <lb/>
            direction with the hare,2 land should follow swiftly and unmis­ <lb/>
            takeably, frequently winding about, and yelping only for good <lb/>
            reason ;]3 and they should never leave the track to return to <lb/>
            the huntsman.</p>
          <p>6. With this shape, and this action, they should be spirit­ <lb/>
            ed, sound in the feet, keen-scented, and have good hair. They <lb/>
            will be spirited, if they do not shrink from the chase even <lb/>
            when the heat prevails; they will be keen-scented, if they <lb/>
            smell the hare in bare, arid, sunny4 places, when the sun 5 is <lb/>
            high up in the sky; they will be sound in the feet, if their <unclear/> <lb/>
            feet are not injured as they run over the mountains in the <lb/>
            same season of the year ; and they will have good hair, if they <lb/>
            have it fine, and thick, and soft.</p>
          <p>7. As to the colour of dogs, it should not be altogether <note type="footnote"> 1 “His round cat-foot, straight hams, and wide-spread thighs." <lb/>

            red, or black, or white ; for such colours are not the signs of <lb/>
            a good breed, but of a common and wild sort. 8. Such as are <lb/>
            red or black should have white hair, and such as are white, <lb/>
            red hair, growing about the face. On the upper part of the <lb/>
            thighs they should have hair growing straight and long, as <lb/>
            well as on the loins and at the extremity of the tail ; at the <lb/>

          <p>9. It will be proper to take out the dogs frequently over <lb/>
            hilly grounds, and but seldom over cultivated fields; for on <lb/>
            the hills they may track and pursue the hare without obstruc­ <lb/>
            tion ; but on cultivated lands they can do neither, on account <lb/>
            of the paths.1 10. It is well, too, to take the dogs, even when <lb/>
            they do not find the hare, over rough ground ; for they thus <lb/>
            strengthen their feet, and are also benefited by exercising <lb/>
            their bodies over such land. 11. In summer they should be <lb/>
            taken out till noon ; in winter, through the whole day ; in <lb/>
            autumn, after noon ; in spring, before evening; for these are <lb/>
            the times when the temperature is moderate.</p>

          <p>Of the tracks, scent, and habits of hares.</p>
          <p>1. THE tracks of the hare are long in winter, on account <lb/>
            of the length of the nights; 2 in summer they are short, for <lb/>
            the contrary reason. In winter, too, there is no scent from <lb/>
            them in the morning, whenever there is boar frost or ice ;3 <lb/>
            for the hoar frost, by its influence, draws the heat into it and <lb/>
            retains it, while the ice congeals it. 2. Those dogs, according­ <lb/>
            ly, which have dull noses, are unable to scent the track when <lb/>
            there is'such weather, until the sun, or the advance of the <note type="footnote"> I As the beaten tracks or paths are apt to draw them off the scent and <lb/>
            mislead them. See Ælian, Hist. An. xiii. 24. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 As the hare has then time to go over much ground. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πάχνη ή παγετός</foreign>.] Pruina and gelu are the significations given to <lb/>

            day, relaxes the frost and ice; and then the dogs can smell, <lb/>
            and the track itself, while it sends up a vapour, gives forth <lb/>
            also a scent. 3. Much dew, too, dulls the scent by keeping <lb/>
            it down ;1 and rains, which fall after long intervals, raise <lb/>
            odours from the ground, and render the track of the hare <lb/>
            difficult to scent, until they are dried up.2 Southerly winds <lb/>
            also make the scent fainter, for they spread moisture through <lb/>
            the air; but northerly winds fix the scent, if it has not <lb/>
            previously been dispelled,3 and preserve it. 4. Rains, in <lb/>
            general, and dews drown it; and the moon dulls it by her <lb/>
            warmth,4 especially when it is full. Scent, indeed, is then <lb/>
            most scarce; for the hares, pleased with the light, and jump­ <lb/>
            ing up, as they sport with one another, place their steps at <lb/>
            long intervals. Scent is perplexed, also, when foxes have <lb/>
            crossed the ground previously.</p>
          <p>5. The spring, from the temperature of the weather, <lb/>
            renders the scent exceedingly clear, unless perchance the <lb/>
            ground, where it is covered with flowers, may inconvenience <lb/>
            the dogs, by mingling the odour of the flowers with that of <lb/>
            the hare. In summer it is weak and uncertain ; for the <lb/>
            ground, being warm, absorbs the warmth which the scent has, <lb/>
            and which is but slight; while the dogs have at that time <lb/>
            less power of smelling, because their bodies are relaxed. <lb/>
            In the autumn the scent is clear ; for of the productions which <lb/>
            the earth yields, those which are cultivated have been then <lb/>
            gathered in, and the wild have withered away; so that the <lb/>
            odours of the plants do not trouble the scent by mingling with <lb/>
            it. 6. The tracks, also, in winter and summer, as well as in <lb/>
            autumn, are mostly straight; but in spring they are perplexed; <lb/>
            for the animals, which are indeed perpetually coupling, <lb/>
            couple most at this season, and hence, by straying about with <lb/>
            one another hither and hither, they necessarily produce this <lb/>
            inconvenience.</p>

            resting-place there arises a stronger scent than from those <lb/>
            which she takes in running away from it; for those which <lb/>
            she takes in going thither are made at a slower and irregular <lb/>
            pace,1 those which she takes in running from it, at a quicker; <lb/>
            the ground is accordingly saturated with the scent of the one, <lb/>
            but is not even filled with that of the other.</p>
          <p>The scent is stronger, likewise, on woody than on bare <lb/>
            ground; for the hare, as she runs about, and occasionally <lb/>
            rests, touches many objects. 8. Hares sink down on what­ <lb/>
            ever the earth produces or has on it, under all kinds of things, <lb/>
            or above them, or among them, or close by them, or at some <lb/>
            distance, great or small, from them or within them ;2 some­ <lb/>
            times springing, too, as far as they can, over the sea, or into <lb/>
            water, if there be anything rising above it or growing on it. <lb/>
            9. The hare, when it wishes to settle, makes its nest, for the <lb/>
            most part, in warm spots, when it is cold; when it is hot, in <lb/>
            shady ones; in spring and autumn, in places exposed to the <lb/>
            sun : those that are unsettled may act otherwise, from being <lb/>
            scared by dogs. 10. As it reclines, it draws the inner part <lb/>
            of the thighs3 under its flanks, putting the fore-legs together, <lb/>
            for the most part, and stretching them out, resting the chin <lb/>
            on the tips of the feet, and spreading the ears over the <lb/>
            shoulder-blades ; by which means it covers the soft parts of <lb/>
            the neck ; 4 and it has also its hair as a protection, being <lb/>
            thick and soft. 11. When it is awake, it winks with its <lb/>
            eyelids; but when it is asleep, the eyelids are raised and <lb/>
            fixed, and the eyes continue unmoved ; also, while asleep, it <lb/>
            moves its nostrils frequently, but when not asleep, less often.</p>
          <p>12. When the ground is giving forth herbage, the cultivated <lb/>
            plains attract the hare more than the hills. It stops, when it <lb/>
            is tracked, in any place whatever, unless it be excessively <lb/>
            frightened at night; when it is thus affected, it hastens off to <lb/>
            other parts. 13. It is so prolific an animal, that when the <lb/>
            female has brought forth, she is ready to bring forth again, <note type="footnote"> I ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Εφιστάμενος</foreign>.] Interdum subsistens.

            and is at the same time conceiving a third broody From the <lb/>
            young hares there is more scent than from the full-grown; for, <lb/>
            as their limbs are weak, they drag them all along upon the <lb/>
            ground. 14. The very young ones the huntsmen let go, from <lb/>
            respect to the goddess.2 Those that are a year old run their <lb/>
            first heat with great speed; the others not so swiftly, for, <lb/>
            though they are nimble, they are not strong.</p>
          <p>15. To find the track of the hare, it is necessary to take the <lb/>
            dogs by the parts above the cultivated grounds;3 (such of <lb/>
            the hares as do not come into cultivated lands betake them­ <lb/>
            selves to meadows, glades, banks of streams, rocks, or woods;) <lb/>
            and if the hare move, we must take care not to cry out, lest <lb/>
            the dogs should be startled,4 and find a difficulty in following <lb/>
            the track. 16. When they are discovered by the dogs, and <lb/>
            pursued, they sometimes cross over brooks, and double, <lb/>
            and slink away into clefts and tortuous hiding-places; for <lb/>
            they fear not only dogs, but also eagles, since, as they pass <lb/>
            over flat slopes and open places, they are frequently carried <lb/>
            off by them, whilst they are under a year old. The older <lb/>
            Dues the dogs pursue and carry off.</p>
          <p>17. Those that frequent the hills are the swiftest, those in <lb/>
            the plains are less so, and those that are about marshy grounds <lb/>
            are the slowest. Those that wander over all sorts of ground <lb/>
            are more difficult to pursue, for they know the short cuts; <lb/>
            and they run chiefly up slopes or along level spots; over <lb/>
            unequal ground they run irregularly, and least of all down­ <lb/>
            hill.</p>
          <p>is. When they are pursued, they are seen best on land that <lb/>
            is turned up, if they have a little redness of colour ;5 and they <lb/>
            are also seen well on stubble, by the light reflected on them ;6 <note type="footnote"> I Superfcetation is attributed to hares by many writers of antiquity, as <lb/>

            they appear very plain, too, along paths and roads, at least <lb/>
            such as are level ; for the bright hue of their hair strikes the <lb/>
            eye; but when they run away among stones, and hills, and <lb/>
            rocky and woody ground, they are not easily perceived, on <lb/>
            account of the similarity of the colour.</p>
          <p>19. When they are in advance of the dogs, they will stop <lb/>
            and squat down, and then raise themselves up to listen <lb/>
            whether any barking or noise of dogs is near them ; and, on <lb/>
            whatever quarter they hear any, they turn away from it. <lb/>
            20. Sometimes, also, when they hear none, but fancy or are <lb/>
            persuaded in themselves that they hear some, they run re­ <lb/>
            peatedly by and over the same ground, varying their steps, <lb/>
            and making track upon track. 21. Those make the longest <lb/>
            runs which are found on open grounds, from the view being <lb/>
            unobstructed ; those run the shortest distance which are <lb/>
            started from woody places, as the obscurity is a hindrance to <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>22. There are two sorts of hares ; for some are large and <lb/>
            blackish, and have a great deal of white in the face ; while <lb/>
            others are smaller and somewhat yellow, and have but little <lb/>
            white. 23. Some have the tail varied with rings of different <lb/>
            colours ; others have it streaked.1 Some have the eyes grey­ <lb/>
            ish, others somewhat blue. In some the black at the tips of <lb/>
            the ears spreads over a large space ; in others, over but a <lb/>
            small one. 24. The lesser sort most of the islands contain; <lb/>
            as well the desert as the inhabited ; and they are more numer­ <lb/>
            ous in the islands than on continents, for there are in most of <lb/>
            them neither foxes, which attack and destroy both them and <lb/>
            their young ones, nor eagles, which large-mountains rather <lb/>
            than small produce, and the mountains in islands are generally <lb/>
            of the less elevated sort. 25. Hunters, too, come but seldom <lb/>
            into desert islands ; and on those which are inhabited there <lb/>
            are but few people, and comparatively few of them given, to <lb/>
            hunting ; while into the sacred islands it is not lawful even to <lb/>
            transport dugs. Since, therefore, the inhabitants hunt but <lb/>
            few of those which exist, and which are constantly multiplying, <lb/>
            there must be a great number of them.</p>
          <p>26. The hare has not a keen sight, for many reasons ; for <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Παράϭειρον</foreign>.] Albedine insignem longiore spatio. Leunclavins. </note><note type="footnote"> ' An den Seiten weiss." Lenz. " Auf den Seiten der Lange nach ges <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[CH. 5."/> <lb/>
            it has its eyes prominent, and the eye-lids small, affording no <lb/>
            protection for the eye-balls ; and their sight is on this account <lb/>
            dim and dispersed.1 27. In addition to this, the animal, being <lb/>
            much given to sleep, is by that means not improved in its <lb/>
            sight.2 The swiftness with which it runs, too, tends greatly <lb/>
            to trouble its vision ; for it turns off its eyes from objects be­ <lb/>
            fore it can perceive what they are. The terror from the dogs, <lb/>
            likewise, following upon it with them when it is chased, <lb/>
            deprives it of all power of foresight; and hence it runs <lb/>
            against many objects, and falls into nets, before it is aware. <lb/>
            29. If it ran, however, straight onwards, it would but seldom <lb/>
            meet with such mishaps ; but, as it winds about, and feels an <lb/>
            attraction towards the place in which it was born and bred, <lb/>
            it is consequently captured. Yet it is not often captured by <lb/>
            the dogs by speed of foot; but such as are caught are caught <lb/>
            in spite of their natural conformation, and under the influence <lb/>
            of chance ; for of all animals that exist, no one of the same <lb/>
            size is equal to the hare in swiftness ; such is the nature of <lb/>
            the parts of which its body is composed.</p>
          <p>30. It has a head light, small, looking downwards, and nar­ <lb/>
            row in the forepart ; a neck slender, round, not stiff, and of a <lb/>
            proper length ; shoulder-blades straight, and not contracted at <lb/>
            the top ;3 the legs joined to them, light and well attached;4 the <lb/>
            breast not heavy with flesh ;5 the sides light and symmetrical; <lb/>
            the loins agile ; the hams fleshy ; the flanks yielding and <lb/>
            sufficiently loose ; the hips round, full everywhere, and separ­ <lb/>
            ated above by a proper interval; the thighs long, of due <lb/>
            thickness, tense on the outside, and not turgid within ; the <lb/>
            hind legs long and firm ; the fore feet extremely flexible, <lb/>
            narrow, and straight ;6 the hind ones firm and broad ; all the <note type="footnote">1 Because, according to Xenophon's notion, the eyes, from being pro­ <lb/>

            feet caring nothing for rough ground ; the hind legs much <lb/>
            thicker than the fore ones, and bending a little outwards ; the <lb/>
            hair short and light. 31. Accordingly it is impossible that <lb/>
            an animal composed of such parts should not be strong, agile, <lb/>
            and extremely nimble.</p>
          <p>That it is nimble we have' sufficient proof; for when it <lb/>
            goes along quietly, it proceeds by leaps ; no man has ever seen <lb/>
            it, or ever will see it, walking ; but, putting the hind feet in <lb/>
            advance of the fore feet, and on the outside of them, it springs <lb/>
            forward. This is plainly seen by the marks which it makes <lb/>
            on the snow. 32. It has a tail, however, not very conducive <lb/>
            to speed ; for it cannot steer the body on account of its short­ <lb/>
            ness ; but the animal produces this effect by the alternate ac­ <lb/>
            tion of the ears, continuing it, even when it is on the very <lb/>
            point of being caught by the dogs ; for, lowering one ear, and <lb/>
            turning it obliquely on the side on which it is threatened <lb/>
            with annoyance, it first sways itself in that direction,1 and <lb/>
            then turns off suddenly in the other, and leaves its pursuers <lb/>
            behind in a moment.</p>
          <p>33. It is so pleasing an animal, that no one who sees it, <lb/>
            whether when it is tracked and discovered, or when it is pur­ <lb/>
            sued or caught, would not forget whatever other object he ad­ <lb/>
            mired.2</p>

            modes of proceeding, 11—6.</p>
          <p>1. THE equipments for dogs are collars,3 leashes, and girths.4 <lb/>
            Let the collars be soft as well as broad, that they may not <lb/>
            wear off the dog's hair. Let the leashes have loops for the <lb/>
            hand attached to them, but nothing else; for those who form <lb/>
            the collars out of the leashes5 do not manage well for their <lb/>
            dogs. Let the girths have broad bands, that they may not <lb/>
            gall their flanks; and let there be iron points stitched into <lb/>
            .them, that they may protect the breeds.6</p>
          <p>2. But it is improper to take dogs out to hunt, whenever <lb/>
            they do not readily take the food that is put before them, as <lb/>
            this is a sufficient indication that they are out of health ; or <lb/>
            whenever the wind blows very strong, as the wind scatters <lb/>
            the scent, and the dogs are unable to catch it, nor will the <lb/>
            nets, either small or large, stand. 3. When neither of these <lb/>
            obstacles presents itself, however, we should take them out <lb/>
            every third day.</p>

            with the country. You should go out with them in the <lb/>
            morning, that they may not fail of finding the track ; for <lb/>
            those who go out late deprive the dogs of all chance of find­ <lb/>

            of the rope that runs round the net let him attach a long large <lb/>
            stone, in order that the net, when it has caught the hare, may <lb/>

            nets in a long range, as well as have them high, that the hare <lb/>
            may not leap over. In tracking the hare, he should make no <lb/>
            delay ;4 for it is sportsman-like, as well as a proof of fondness <lb/>
            for exertion, to use every means to capture the animal <lb/>
            speedily.</p>
          <p>9. The larger nets let him fix on level spots, and road-nets <lb/>
            at the roads, stretching them from the roads in proper direc­ <lb/>

            silence, lest the hare, if she happen to be near, should run off <lb/>
            on hearing their voices. 12. Having tied the dogs to trees, <lb/>
            each separately, that they may be easily unfastened, let them <lb/>
            fix the smaller and larger nets, as has been said ; and then let <lb/>

            to offer them a share of what is captured, let him loose that <lb/>

            be done, if it is winter, at sunrise; if summer, before day­ <lb/>
            break ; and at other seasons between the two. 14. When the <lb/>
            dog, out of all the tracks that intersect one another, has <lb/>
            found the right one, let the hunter set loose another dog, and <lb/>
            when this one has gained the track, let him loose the others <lb/>
            one by one at no long intervals, and follow them, not urging <lb/>
            them, but calling each by name, yet not frequently, lest they <lb/>
            should be excited before the proper time. 15. The dogs will <lb/>
            hasten forward with joy and spirit, discovering two or three <lb/>
            tracks, as the case may be, proceeding along and over them, <lb/>

            their whole bodies, advancing as it were with hostile ardour, <lb/>

            soon getting out of sight, will in general come round again to <lb/>

            cry, " Upon her, boy, upon her ! Now boy, now boy !" and <lb/>
            the boy must intimate whether she is caught or not. If .she <lb/>
            is caught in the first run, he must call in the dogs, and seek <lb/>
            for another; if not, he must still run on with the dogs with <lb/>
            all possible speed, not relaxing, but hurrying forward with <lb/>
            the utmost exertion. 19. If the dogs, as they pursue, fall in <lb/>
            with her again, he must shout, " Well done, well done, dogs ! <lb/>
            Follow, dogs!" and if the dogs get far before him, and he is <lb/>
            unable, pursuing their track, to come up with them, but misses <lb/>
            the way which they have taken, or cannot see them, though <lb/>
            they are straying about somewhere near, or yelping, or keep­ <lb/>

            that he meets, and ask, " Have you seen my dogs anywhere ?" <lb/>
            20. When he has discovered where they are, he may, if they <lb/>
            are on the track, go up to them and encourage them, repeat­ <lb/>
            ing, as often as he can, the name of each do-, and varying <lb/>
            the tones of his voice, making it sharp or grave, or gentle or <lb/>
            strong. In addition to other exhortations, he may. if the <lb/>
            pursuit is on a hill, call out thus, " Well done, dogs! Well <lb/>
            done!" but if they are not on the track, but have gone be­ <lb/>
            yond it, he must call to them, " Come back, come back, dogs !" <lb/>
            21. After they have come upon the track, he must lead them <lb/>
            round,3 making many and frequent windings ; and wherever the <lb/>
            scent is obscure, he ought to take a stake as a mark for himself,4 <note type="footnote"> 1 "0 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀμπἐχεται</foreign>.] " That with which he is clad," i. e. his outer gar­ <lb/>

            forward, and leap from side to side, will seem to have a com­ <lb/>
            mon feeling, and to be forming conjectures, making signs to <lb/>
            one another, and fixing as it were recognised bounds for <lb/>
            themselves,1 and will start forward quickly in pursuit; but <lb/>
            while they thus run hither and thither over the track, you <lb/>
            must not urge them or run on with them, lest through eager­ <lb/>
            ness they should go beyond it. 13. But when they are close <lb/>
            upon the hare, and make it- plain to the huntsman that they <lb/>
            are so, he must take care lest through fear of the dogs she <lb/>
            dart off in advance. The dogs themselves, whisking about <lb/>
            their tails, running against and frequently leaping over one <lb/>
            another, yelping, tossing up their heads, looking towards the <lb/>
            huntsman, and intimating that these are the true tracks of the <lb/>
            hare, will rouse her of themselves,2 and spring upon her with <lb/>
            loud cries. 14. Should she run into the nets, or flee past <lb/>
            them, whether on the outside or the inside, let the net-keeper, <lb/>
            who is stationed at each of these parts, call out that such is <lb/>
            the case. Should the hare be captured, the huntsman may <lb/>
            proceed to seek another; if not, he may still continue to pur­ <lb/>
            sue her, using the same incitements to the dogs as before.</p>
          <p>15. When the dogs are tired with running, and it is late in <lb/>
            the day, the hunter may still continue to seek3 for the hare, <lb/>
            which will also be tired, leaving nothing unexamined of all <lb/>
            that the earth produces or has upon it, making frequent turn­ <lb/>
            ings about, that the animal may not escape him (for it lies in <lb/>

          <p>Of breeding and training the dogs.</p>
          <p>1. IN the winter it is proper to let the females rest from <lb/>
            labour, and to attend to breeding, that, from enjoying repose, <lb/>
            they may produce a stout offspring towards the spring; for <lb/>
            that season is particularly favourable for the growth of dogs. <lb/>
            During fourteen days the want of the male1 affects them. <lb/>
            2. It is proper to take them to vigorous dogs after their ar­ <lb/>
            dour is somewhat remitted,2 that they may conceive the <lb/>
            sooner, and, while they are pregnant, not to take them out to <lb/>
            hunt constantly, but only at intervals, lest they should mis­ <lb/>
            carry from too much exertion. They go with young sixty days.</p>
          <p>3. When the puppies are born, we must leave them with <lb/>
            the mother, and not put them to another dog ; for the nurture <lb/>
            of strange dogs does not sufficiently contribute to growth ; but <lb/>
            the milk and breath of their mothers is good for them, and <lb/>
            their caresses pleasing.</p>
          <p>4. After the puppies are able to run about, we must give <lb/>
            them milk for a year, with those sorts of food on which they <lb/>
            are to live always, and nothing else; for much over-feeding <lb/>
            of puppies distorts their legs, and produces diseases in their <note type="footnote"> 1 'H <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνάγκη αὕτη</foreign>.] Impetus ad Venerem.

            centes a coitu, interposito justo temporis spatio. But Schneider, with <lb/>
            greater reason, understands <foreign xml:lang="grc">τη̃ς ἀνάγκης</foreign>, and makes the sense cum paul­ <lb/>
            latim remisit ardor libidinis, an interpretation fully supported by Aris­ <lb/>
            totle, H. A. vi. 20. Weiske's interpretation is at variance, as Sauppe <lb/>
            observes, with what Aristotle says in the same passage, <foreign xml:lang="grc">κυι̂ϭκεται δὲ κύων <lb/>

            bodies; and their interior parts are thus rendered unsound.</p>
          <p>5. We should give them short names, that it may be easy <lb/>
            to call them. They ought to be such as these: Psyche,1 <lb/>

            Stibon,46 Horme.47</p>
          <p>6. We must not take the female puppies out to hunt till <lb/>
            they are eight months old, or the male till they are ten. The <lb/>
            huntsman must not set them loose on the track to the hare'a <lb/>
            form, but, keeping them tied with long straps, must let them <lb/>
            follow the dogs that are scenting the hare, allowing them to <lb/>
            run along the track. 7. When the hare is found, if they be <lb/>
            well qualified by nature for running, he must not let them <lb/>
            loose at once, but must wait till the hare has got in advance, <lb/>
            so that they can no longer see her, and then let them go. 8. <lb/>
            For if he lets loose immediately dogs that are well qualified by <lb/>
            nature, and full of spirit, for running, they will, as soon as they <lb/>
            see the hare, use such exertion as to injure themselves, as <lb/>
            their frames are not yet strong ; and against such mishaps the <lb/>
            huntsman must be on his guard. 9. If, on the contrary, they <lb/>
            be but poorly qualified for running, there is nothing to hinder <lb/>
            him from letting them go at once ; for, as they will be hopeless <lb/>
            at first of overtaking the hare, they will do themselves no such <lb/>
            mischief.</p>

            the young dogs to follow until they overtake her; and when <lb/>
            she is caught, he may give her to them to tear to pieces. <lb/>
            lo. When they are no longer willing to stay by the nets, <lb/>
            but scatter themselves about, he must call them in until they <lb/>
            are trained to find the hare by running after her, lest, from <lb/>
            perpetually going in quest of her without regard to order, they <lb/>
            become at last untrainable ;1 a result of the worst kind. 11. It is <lb/>
            proper accordingly to give them their food at the nets, as long <lb/>
            as they are young, when the nets are taken up, that if they <lb/>
            should stray away in the hunting-field for want of knowing <lb/>
            what they are about, they may be recovered through return­ <lb/>
            ing to that spot.2 They will no longer require this care when <lb/>
            they begin to have a hostile feeling towards the beast that <lb/>
            they hunt, and are prompted to think more of their prey than <lb/>
            of their ordinary food.</p>
          <p>12. It will be well for the huntsman, in general, to give the <lb/>
            dogs their food himself; for though, when they are in want, <lb/>
            they do not know who is the cause of it, they conceive an <lb/>
            affection for him, who, when they are eager to receive it, <lb/>
            gives it them.</p>

          <p>Of hunting hares in winter.</p>
          <p>1. IT is proper that hares should be tracked, when snow <lb/>
            has fallen in such a quantity that the ground is hidden; for <lb/>
            if black spots appear on the surface, the animal will be diffi­ <lb/>
            cult to trace. When there has been snow, and the north <lb/>
            wind blows, the tracks are visible for a long time ;3 but if the <note type="footnote"> 1 ’'<foreign xml:lang="grc">Εκκυνοι</foreign>.] A sportsman's term for dogs that will not be kept to one <lb/>

            wind be southerly, and the sun also shines, they are to be <lb/>
            seen but a. short time, as they soon melt away. While snow <lb/>
            continues to fall, it is of no use to attempt to track the animal, <lb/>
            for the snow covers the traces; nor is it of any use if the <lb/>
            wind be strong, for it effaces them by throwing up the snow.</p>
          <p>2. We must never go out to hunt with dogs, therefore, un­ <lb/>
            der such circumstances; for the snow parches the noses and <lb/>
            feet of the dogs, and carries off the scent of the hare from ex­ <lb/>
            cessive cold.</p>
          <p>But the hunter may take his nets and go out with a com­ <lb/>
            rade to the hills, at a distance from the cultivated grounds, <lb/>
            and, when he has found traces of the hare, may follow them. <lb/>
            3. If they should be perplexed, he must go back on the same <lb/>
            track, and still keep along it, making circuits so as to go <lb/>
            round the whole of it seeking whither it finally leads ; for <lb/>
            the hare frequently wanders hither and thither, hesitating <lb/>
            where it shall settle itself; and it is accustomed also to be <lb/>
            very artful in going about, from being constantly pursued by <lb/>
            its footsteps. 4. When the track shows itself plainly, the <lb/>
            hunter may proceed straight forwards ; and it will lead him <lb/>
            either to a shady or to a steep place, because the wind carries <lb/>
            the snow over such spots. The hare therefore leaves many <lb/>
            places in which she might sit, and seeks for one of this kind. <lb/>
            When the footsteps lead to such places, he must not approach <lb/>
            too near, lest the hare should start, but make a circuit round <lb/>
            about; for it is to be expected that a hare is there; and it <lb/>
            will presently become certain, since there will be no track <lb/>
            from such spots leading out in any other direction. When it <lb/>
            is clear that the hare is there, he may let her alone (for she <lb/>
            will not move), and seek for another, before the footsteps are <lb/>
            obliterated, having regard to the time of day, in order that, if <lb/>
            he find others, there may be time enough left for putting <lb/>
            round the nets. 5. If such is the case, he must stretch the <lb/>
            nets round each of the hares in the same way as on the dark <note type="footnote"> ones, he does not explain. Schneider supposes that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔξω</foreign> means out of <lb/>
            the snow, or on the black ground; but whom will this satisfy ? Leun­ <lb/>
            clavius's version gives nothing more than vestigia diu manifesta extant. <lb/>
            On the whole, it appears that it is impossible to make anything plausible <lb/>
            of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔξω</foreign> , and that it would be well for future editors to expunge it or put <lb/>
            it in brackets. GaiI takes no notice of it in his version, and I have fol­ <lb/>

            soil, so that he may catch whatever hare they are near within <lb/>
            them; and when they are fixed, he must go and rouse the hare. <lb/>
            If she escapes from the net, he must run after her on her <lb/>
            track; and she will betake herself to other similar spots, un­ <lb/>
            less she chance to bury herself in the snow. He must ac­ <lb/>
            cordingly ascertain where she is, and place the nets round <lb/>
            her. Should she make no stay in any place, he must continue <lb/>
            the pursuit; since she will be captured even without the as­ <lb/>
            sistance of the nets ; for she soon grows weary from the depth <lb/>
            of the snow, and the great quantity of it which attaches itself <lb/>
            to her feet, which are hairy underneath.</p>

          <p>Of hunting deer.</p>
          <p>i. FOR hunting fawns and stags Indian dogs1 should be <lb/>
            used; for they are strong, large, swift, and not deficient in <lb/>
            courage; and, having these qualities, are able to endure <lb/>
            fatigue. The very young fawns2 we should hunt in the <lb/>
            spring, for it is in that season that they are born. 2. The hunts­ <lb/>
            man should first go into the grassy glades, where the deer are <lb/>
            most numerous, and survey the ground; and, wherever they <lb/>
            are seen, he should come to that spot with his dogs and spears <lb/>
            before daybreak, and should tie the dogs to the trees at some <lb/>
            distance off, lest, if they should see the deer, they should be­ <lb/>
            gin to bark; and he himself should keep on the watch. 3. <lb/>
            At dawn he will see the hinds bringing each her young one <lb/>
            to the place where she is going to have its bed. Having lain <lb/>
            down, and given their young ones suck, looking round, at <lb/>
            the same time, lest they should be seen by any one, they will <lb/>
            go off severally to the parts opposite their young, still keeping <lb/>
            watch over them. 4. The huntsman, on seeing them in this <note type="footnote"> 1 For some further description of these, see Aristotle, H. A. viii. 28; <lb/>
            Ælian, H. A. viii. 1 • Pollux, v. 37, 43. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Xenophon recommends above, c. 5, sect. 14, that we should spare <lb/>

            not show the same consideration for young deer ? Schneider. </note> <pb n="359"/>

            condition, must go and let loose his dogs, and, taking his <lb/>
            spears in his hand, must advance towards the first of the <lb/>
            fawns, at least to the part where he has seen it lying, taking <lb/>
            careful note of the ground ; for places often assume a different <lb/>
            appearance as a person draws near them from that which they <lb/>
            presented when he was at a distance. 5. When he has caught <lb/>
            sight of the fawn, he must go close to it; for it will remain <lb/>
            quiet, crouching1 as it were down upon the ground, and will <lb/>
            let the huntsman take it up, making at the same time a loud <lb/>
            noise, unless it be wet with rain ; since, if such be the case, it <lb/>
            will not lie still, as the moisture which it has in it, being con­ <lb/>
            densed by the cold, will soon make it move off. 6. But it <lb/>
            will be caught by the dogs, which will pursue it with vigour; <lb/>
            and when the huntsman has got possession of it, he must give <lb/>
            it to the net-keeper; it will utter a cry, and the hind, seeing <lb/>
            and hearing what is going on, will rush upon the man that <lb/>
            holds it, and endeavour to take it from him. 7. At this junc­ <lb/>
            tion the huntsman must cheer on the dogs, and use his spears ; <lb/>
            and when he has captured this animal, he may proceed to <lb/>
            take others, adopting the same means for getting possession of <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>8. The very young fawns may be taken thus; but those <lb/>
            that are well grown give some trouble; for they feed with <lb/>
            their dams and other deer, and run off, when they are <lb/>
            pursued, in the midst of the herd, or sometimes in advance of <lb/>
            it, but very rarely in the rear. 9. The hinds, acting in de­ <lb/>
            fence of them, trample down the dogs, so that they are not <lb/>
            easily taken, unless the hunter rushes straight in among the <unclear/> <lb/>
            erd, and separates them from one another, when one of the <lb/>
            young may be left behind by himself. 10. When the herd is <lb/>
            thus violently scattered, the dogs will be left behind at the <lb/>
            first run after the fawn; for the desertion of the other deer <lb/>
            will render it excessively timid, and the swiftness of fawns of <lb/>
            that age is beyond all other swiftness; but at the second or <lb/>
            third run they are soon taken, as their bodies, from being <lb/>
            still tender, are unable to bear up under fatigue. <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πιέσας ὡς ἐπὶ γη̃ν</foreign>.] <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πιέζειν</foreign> is here used for <foreign xml:lang="grc">πτήσσειν</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">πτώσσειν</foreign> <lb/>

            snares should be made of twigs of yew twisted, with the bark <lb/>
            not taken off,1 lest they should grow rotten; and should have <lb/>

            which is to be fixed on the crown made of twisted hemp, as <lb/>
            well as the rope itself; for this material is least likely to be­ <lb/>

            Let the piece of wood which is suspended to it be of common <lb/>
            or scarlet oak, with the bark on, three spans3 in length, and <lb/>
            one palm3 in thickness. 14. The hunter must fix these snares <lb/>
            by opening the ground to the depth of five palms; and this <lb/>
            opening must be round, and even at the edge with the crowns <lb/>
            of the snares, and growing gradually narrower below;4 he <lb/>
            must also open a portion of the ground for the rope and the <lb/>
            wood, as deep as it is necessary for both to be buried. 15. <lb/>
            When he has done this, he must put the snare over the open­ <lb/>
            ing, sinking it to a depth equal with the surface, and put the <lb/>
            noose of the rope round the crown, letting down the rope itself <lb/>

            thorn over the crown, not sticking out above the surface, and <lb/>
            upon the twigs some dry leaves, such as the season may af­ <lb/>
            ford. 16. After this he must strew upon the leaves a portion <lb/>
            of the earth taken from the surface1 of the parts that have <lb/>
            been dug, and upon this some solid earth brought from a dis­ <lb/>
            tance, in order that the position of the snare may be concealed <lb/>
            as much as possible from the deer; and what remains of the <lb/>
            earth he should carry off to a distance from the snare, for if <lb/>
            the animal finds by the smell that it has been recently dis­ <lb/>
            turbed (and this it soon does), it becomes suspicious.</p>
          <p>17. The huntsman must then keep watch with his dogs by <lb/>
            the snares that are placed2 on the hills, especially in the <lb/>
            morning; and he may do so during the rest of the day ; on <lb/>
            cultivated grounds he should be on the look-out before day­ <lb/>
            break ; for on the hills the deer are caught not only during <lb/>
            the night, but also in the day, because such places are unfre­ <lb/>
            quented by man; but in cultivated grounds they are caught <lb/>
            during the night, as they are afraid of men there during the <lb/>
            day. 18. When he finds the snare turned up, he must let <lb/>
            loose his dogs, and pursue, cheering them on, along the track <lb/>
            of the wooden clog, observing carefully whither it leads. In <lb/>
            general it will not be difficult to trace, for the stones will be <lb/>
            up, and the scratches of the clog will be very plain on culti­ <lb/>
            vated ground ; if the animal however runs through rough <lb/>
            places, the rocky parts will have portions of the bark stripped <lb/>
            from the clog adhering to them, and thus the pursuit will be <lb/>
            rendered easier. 19. Should the deer have been caught by <lb/>
            the fore-foot, it will be very soon secured ; for the clog, as the <lb/>
            animal runs, will strike against its whole body and face; 3 but <lb/>
            if it be caught by the hind-foot, the clog, as it is dragged along, <lb/>
            will impede the motion of its whole body. Sometimes the clog, <lb/>
            too, will catch itself in forked branches of the wood, and the <lb/>
            deer, unless it break the rope, will be caught there. 20. Should <lb/>
            the huntsman capture it in this way, or by overcoming it with <lb/>
            fatigue, he must not, if it be a male, approach near it, for it <note type="footnote"> 1 As the earth on the surface will differ very much in smell and appear­ <lb/>

          <p>Of hunting boars.</p>
          <p>1. FOR the wild boar it is necessary to have Indian, Cretan, <lb/>
            Locrian, and Spartan dogs ; with nets, javelins, spears, and <lb/>
            snares. As to the dogs of this sort, they must not be ordinary <lb/>
            ones, that they may be fit to contend with the wild beast. <lb/>
            2. The nets must be of the same cord as those for hares ; but <lb/>
            let the cords consist of forty-five threads in three strands, <lb/>
            each strand being made of fifteen threads. Let there be ten <lb/>
            meshes1 in depth from the edge, and the depth of the nooses2 <lb/>
            a pygon.3 Let the ropes that run round the net be half as <lb/>
            thick again as the cords of the nets ; let the nets have rings at <lb/>
            the extremities ; and let the ropes be inserted under the <lb/>
            nooses, and the ends of them come out through the rings. <lb/>
            Fifteen nets will be sufficient.</p>
          <p>3. As to the javelins, let them be of all kinds, having the <lb/>
            points of considerable breadth, and sharp as a razor, and the <lb/>
            handles strong. The spears should have heads of the length <lb/>
            of five palms, and in the middle, where the iron is inserted <lb/>
            into the wood, guards jutting out, formed of the metal, very <lb/>
            stout; and let them have handles of corneil wood, of the thick­ <lb/>
            ness of an ordinary spear. The snares should be similar <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δεχάμματοι</foreign>.] “ Ten knots," i. e 'ten meshes." See note on c. 2, <lb/>
            sect 5. </note><note type="footnote">2 Nooses through which the animal thrust its head, and was caught by <lb/>

            to those for deer. But let the hunters go in company ; for the <lb/>
            animal is not to be captured without difficulty, and the assist­ <lb/>
            ance of many hands. How it is necessary to use each of these <lb/>
            implements in hunting, I will show.</p>
          <p>4. In the first place, then, when the hunters have come to <lb/>
            the place where they suppose that there is a boar, they must <lb/>
            bring up the dogs quietly, letting one of the Spartan dogs <lb/>
            loose, and keeping the others tied, and go round about the <lb/>
            place with the loose dog. 5. When this dog has found traces <lb/>
            of the boar, they must continue their course along the track, <lb/>
            which is to guide the whole train.1 There will also be many <lb/>
            indications of the boar to guide the huntsmen ; marks of his <lb/>
            footsteps on soft ground; pieces of the shrubs broken off in <lb/>
            the woody parts ; and where there are large trees, scratches of <lb/>
            his tusks upon them. 6. The dog, pursuing the track, will <lb/>
            generally come to some woody spot; for the animal commonly <lb/>
            lies in such places, as they are warm in winter, and cool in <lb/>
            summer. 7. When it comes to the beast's lair, it begins to <lb/>
            bark; yet the boar will seldom rise on that account. It will <lb/>
            be necessary, therefore, to take the dog and tie him up with <lb/>
            the others at some distance from the lair, and stretch the nets <lb/>
            at the entrance to the thicket, hanging the meshes upon <lb/>
            the forked branches 2 of the wood ; and it will be proper, at <lb/>
            the same time, to spread the net in a circuit extending out­ <lb/>
            wards to some distance, placing branches of trees as supports <lb/>
            on each side within, in order that the rays of light may pene­ <lb/>
            trate through the meshes as much as possible into that circuit, <lb/>
            and that the part within it may be as clear as possible for the <lb/>
            animal when he rushes toward the nets. The rope that <lb/>
            runs round the nets they ought to attach to a strong tree, <lb/>
            and not to bushes; for bushes give way 3 on open ground. <note type="footnote"> 1 ‛<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ηγουμένη̨ἀκολουθία̨</foreign>.] These words have afforded much work for <lb/>
            the commentators, and are perhaps in some way corrupt. But, as they <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡγουμένη</foreign> as agreeing with <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰχνεύσει</foreign>, which precedes it, and as governing <lb/>

            posed, as well as various emendations. The only reasonable explanation <lb/>
            of which it seems susceptible is, " come together, give way, yield," as <lb/>
            bushes will do on " open ground," that is, where there are no strong <lb/>
            trees to support them. </note> <pb n="364"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[CH. 10."/> <lb/>
            About1 each net they must stop up even the less open pas­ <lb/>
            sages 2 through the thicket, that the boar may rush straight <lb/>
            into the nets, without turning aside from them.</p>
          <p>8. When the nets are fixed, let them return to the dogs and <lb/>
            set them all loose, and, taking their javelins and spears, go <lb/>
            forward themselves. One of the most experienced of the <lb/>
            hunters should cheer on the dogs; and the rest should follow <lb/>
            in order, but at some considerable distance one from another, <lb/>
            that a passage of sufficient breadth between them may be <lb/>
            left for the boar; for if, as he makes his retreat, he should <lb/>
            rush in among a number of them, there is danger that they <lb/>
            may be wounded; since against whomsoever he runs, upon <lb/>
            him he vents his rage. 9. When the dogs come near the <lb/>
            beast's lair, they will make a start forward ; the boar, being <lb/>
            disturbed, will spring up, and whichever of the dogs happens <lb/>
            to meet him face to face, he will toss him into the air, and, <lb/>
            running forwards, will fall into the nets; or, if he does not, <lb/>
            the hunters must pursue him. Should the ground, on which <lb/>
            the net catches him, be sloping,3 he will soon rise; should <lb/>
            it be level, he will keep himself on his feet, intent on saving <lb/>
            himself. 10. At this juncture the dogs will press forward; <lb/>
            and the hunters, keeping on their guard against him, must <lb/>
            throw their javelins at him, and pelt him with stones, gather­ <lb/>
            ing round behind him, and at a considerable distance, until, by <lb/>
            pushing himself forward, he pulls down the rope that runs <lb/>
            round the net to its utmost stretch; and then, whoever among <lb/>
            the company is the most skilful and the most vigorous, must <lb/>
            go up to him and spear him in the fore part of the body. <lb/>
            11. But if, notwithstanding he is struck with javelins and <lb/>
            stones, he will not stretch the rope, but draws back, and makes <lb/>
            a turn upon any one that comes near him, one of the hunters <lb/>
            must in that case take his spear and go up to him, holding it <lb/>
            with the left hand on the fore part, and the right on the <lb/>
            hinder; for the left directs it, and the right impels it; and let <lb/>
            his left foot be in advance corresponding with the left hand, <lb/>
            while the right is behind in accordance with the other hand. <lb/>
            12. As he advances, he must present the spear, with his feet <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϓπὲρ</foreign>.] " Circa, prope, ad." Weiske. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τὰ δύσορμα</foreign>.] Even passages through which the boar does not <lb/>
            usually go out and in must be stopped, lest he make his way out by them <lb/>
            to avoid the nets. Sauppe. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 So that the boar falls. </note><note type="footnote"/> <pb n="365"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="§ 13—16.]"/> <lb/>
            not much farther apart than in wrestling, turning the left <lb/>
            side forward towards the left hand, looking straight into the <lb/>
            very eye of the boar, and watching every movement of his head. <lb/>
            As he holds out his spear, he must take care lest the boar, by <lb/>
            turning his head aside, wrest it out of his hand ; for he will follow <lb/>
            up the charge after it is thus wrested. 13. Should he have this <lb/>
            misfortune, he must throw himself flat upon his face, and cling <lb/>
            to whatever substance is below him ; for, if the boar fall upon <lb/>
            him in this position, he will be unable to seize his body on <lb/>
            account of his tusks being turned up ;1 but if he attack him <lb/>
            standing erect, he must necessarily be wounded. The boar <lb/>
            will accordingly endeavour to raise him up; and if he cannot <lb/>
            do so, will trample upon him with his feet. 14. When he is <lb/>
            in this perilous condition, there is but one mode of delivering <lb/>
            him from it, which is, for one of his fellow-hunters to come up <lb/>
            close to the animal with his spear, and irritate him by feigning <lb/>
            to throw it; but he must not throw it, lest he should hit his <lb/>
            companion who is on the ground. 15. When the boar sees <lb/>
            him doing this, he will leave the man whom he has under him, <lb/>
            and turn with rage and fury on the one who is provoking him. <lb/>
            The other must then jump up, but take care to do so with his <lb/>
            spear in his hand; for there is no honourable 2 way of saving <lb/>
            himself but by overcoming the boar. 16. He must therefore <lb/>
            present his spear in the same manner as before, and thrust it <lb/>
            forwards within the shoulder-blade, where the throat3 is, and <lb/>
            must hold it firm and press against it with all his might. <lb/>
            The boar will advance upon him courageously, and, if the <lb/>
            guards of the spear did not prevent him, would push along the <lb/>
            handle of it until he reached the person holding it. 17. Such <lb/>
            is his vigour that there is in him what no one would suppose; <lb/>
            for so hot are his tusks when he is just dead, that if a person <lb/>
            lays hairs upon them, the hairs shrivel up; and when he is <lb/>
            alive, they are actually on fire whenever he is irritated; for <lb/>
            otherwise he would not singe the tips of dogs' hair when he <lb/>
            misses inflicting a wound on their bodies.4 <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τὴν σιμότητα τω̃ν ὀδόντων</foreign>.] Dentes sursum tendentes. Zeune. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 For he must not, with his spear in his hand, desert his companion, <lb/>

            more, trouble. But if it be a sow that falls into the net, the <lb/>
            hunter must run forward and strike it, taking care however <lb/>
            that he be not pushed down ; for, if he should have this mis­ <lb/>
            fortune, he will necessarily be trampled upon and bitten. He <lb/>
            must not therefore fall willingly ; but if he should happen to <lb/>
            fall unwillingly, his mode of rising must be the same as in the <lb/>
            case of the boar.</p>
          <p>19. They are caught also in the following manner. Nets <lb/>
            are stretched for them in passages through the forests, in thick­ <lb/>
            ets, winding valleys, and rough grounds, where there are out­ <lb/>
            lets to grassy spots, and marshes, and waters. He that is <lb/>
            appointed for this duty guards the nets with a spear in his <lb/>
            hand. Others bring up the dogs, looking for the most eligible <lb/>
            places; and, when the boar is found, he is at once pursued.</p>
          <p>20. Should he fall into the net, the net-keeper must take <lb/>
            up his spear, and use it in the way which I have described ; <lb/>
            if he does not run into the net, he must hasten after him. He <lb/>
            may be caught also, when it is hot weather, by being pursued <lb/>
            by the dogs; for though he is an animal of vast strength, yet <lb/>
            he soon becomes exhausted from shortness of breath. 21. <lb/>
            Many dogs, however, are killed in such chases, and the hunt­ <lb/>
            ers themselves are in peril. But when, in the pursuit, they <lb/>
            are compelled to present their spears to the boar as he is in <lb/>
            the water, or has retired to some steep place, or is in a thicket <lb/>
            from which he is unwilling to come out, though, in such a <lb/>
            case, there is neither net nor anything else to prevent him <lb/>
            from rushing immediately on the person who approaches him, <lb/>
            they must nevertheless advance upon him, and show that cour­ <lb/>
            age by which they were induced to engage in such toils for <lb/>
            the gratification of their propensity. 22. They must use their <lb/>
            spears, and such bodily efforts as have been described ;1 for <lb/>
            then, if any one of them suffers any hurt, he will not suffer it <lb/>
            for want of acting rightly.</p>
          <p>Snares are set for them just as for deer, in the same places; <lb/>
            and the same modes of watching, pursuing, approaching them, <lb/>
            and using the spear are adopted. 23. Whenever their young <lb/>
            ones are taken, they do not allow themselves to be captured <lb/>
            without difficulty ; f)r they do not stray about alone, as long <note type="footnote"> 1 Sect. 16. </note> <pb n="367"/>

            as they are small; and when the dogs find them, or they fore­ <lb/>
            see any danger, they soon disappear among the wood. Both <lb/>
            the old ones also generally follow them, which are then very <lb/>
            fierce, and fight more resolutely for them than for themselves.</p>

          <p>Of hunting lions, leopards, and other wild beasts.</p>
          <p>1. LIONS, leopards, lynxes, panthers, bears, and other wild <lb/>
            beasts of that description, are caught in foreign parts; some <lb/>
            about the mountains Pangæus and Cittus beyond Macedonia, <lb/>
            others about Olympus in Mysia, others on Mount Pindus, <lb/>
            others on Nysa beyond Syria, and upon other mountains which <lb/>
            are suited for breeding such animals. 2. Some of these <lb/>
            beasts, on account of the difficulty of approaching their <lb/>
            abodes, are taken by means of the drug called aconite, which <lb/>
            the hunters throw in their way about the banks of streams, <lb/>
            and whatever other places they frequent, mixing it with what­ <lb/>
            ever each of the animals likes to eat.1 3. Some of them also <lb/>
            are captured as they come down into the plains in the night, <lb/>
            being intercepted by the aid of horses and armed men, but <lb/>
            not without bringing those who take them into danger. 4. <lb/>
            For some of them, again, they make pit-falls, round, large, <lb/>
            and deep, leaving in the middle a pillar of earth, upon the top <lb/>
            of which they put a goat, tied fast, towards night; they also <lb/>
            hedge the pit-fall round with wood (leaving no passage <lb/>
            through), in order that the animals may not see over2 into it. <lb/>
            Hearing the bleating of the goat during the night, they run <lb/>
            round about the hedge, and, when they find no inlet, leap over <lb/>
            it and are caught. <note type="footnote"> 1 According to Pollux, v. 82, the drug causes diarrhoea, which so weak­ <lb/>

          <p>Hunting, an introduction to military exercises and service, rendering meu <lb/>
            abler defenders of their country. Its moral effects.</p>
          <p>1. CONCERNING the. modes of proceeding in the chase I <lb/>
            have now spoken. Those who are fond of the pursuit will <lb/>
            receive many benefits from it ; for they will secure health for <lb/>
            their bodies, greater keenness of sight and hearing,1 and a <lb/>
            later old age. 2. It is also an excellent preparation for the <lb/>
            toils of war ; for, in the first place, when hunters march under <lb/>
            arms through difficult roads, they will not faint, but will endure <lb/>
            the toil from being accustomed to such exertion in capturing <lb/>
            wild beasts. They will likewise be able to sleep on hard <lb/>
            couches, and will be excellent guardians of what is intrusted <lb/>
            to them. 3. In marches against the enemy they will both be <lb/>
            in a condition to pursue their course, and to do what they are <lb/>
            ordered, because they are used to similar exertions in captur­ <lb/>
            ing beasts of prey. If they are placed in the front of the <lb/>
            army, they will not leave their posts, as they are well qualified <lb/>
            for persistence. 4. In a rout of the enemy, they will pursue <lb/>
            them straight onwards, and with safety, over every sort of <lb/>
            ground, from being familiarized to such exercise. If their <lb/>
            own army experience misfortune, they will be able, in places <lb/>
            that are marshy, or precipitous, or otherwise difficult, to save <lb/>
            themselves, as well as others, without dishonour ; for their <lb/>
            practice in such exertions will supply them with greater <lb/>
            knowledge than those around them. 5. Such men, even when <lb/>
            a great number of their allies have been put to flight, have <lb/>
            renewed the contest, and by their well-exercised strength and <lb/>
            courage have repulsed the enemy, who were led into error by <lb/>
            the difficulties of the ground ; for it belongs to those who have <lb/>
            their bodies and minds in good condition to be always near to <lb/>
            good fortune. 6. Our ancestors also, knowing that from such <lb/>
            causes they had been successful against their adversaries, paid <lb/>
            great attention to the exercises of the youth ; for though they <lb/>
            had in early times no abundance of the fruits of the ground, <lb/>
            yet they did not think proper to hinder the young men from <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ὁρα̃ν καὶ άκούειν μα̃λλον</foreign>.] “Ils auront la vue meilleure, l'oreille <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="§ 7—13.]"/> <lb/>
            hunting over anything that grows upon the earth. 7. In ad­ <lb/>
            dition, they decreed that they should not hunt in the night <lb/>
            within a great number of stadia from the city, lest those who <lb/>
            were skilled in the art should take from them their prey ; <lb/>
            for they saw that this one pleasure of youth was productive <lb/>
            of many advantages to them, as it renders them prudent and <lb/>
            just, from being brought up in real action ;2 8. while, if they <lb/>
            wish to pursue other honourable occupations, it does not draw <lb/>
            them away from them, as other pleasures, of a vicious kind, <lb/>
            do ; pleasures in which they ought not to engage.</p>
          <p>9. From men thus exercised, therefore, are formed good <lb/>
            soldiers and good leaders; for those from whose minds and <lb/>
            bodies toil has eradicated unbecoming and licentious inclina­ <lb/>
            tions, and infused into them a desire of virtue, are the most <lb/>
            excellent of citizens, since they will neither allow their me­ <lb/>
            tropolis to be wronged, nor the lands of their country to be <lb/>
            laid waste.</p>
          <p>10. Yet some say that people ought not to cherish a love of <lb/>
            hunting, lest they should neglect their domestic affairs ; but <lb/>
            such persons do not know that all who benefit their country <lb/>
            and their friends are most attentive to their domestic affairs; <lb/>
            II. and if, accordingly, those who are fond of hunting prepare <lb/>
            themselves to be useful, in the most important particulars, to <lb/>
            their country, they will not be neglectful of that which con­ <lb/>
            cerns themselves ; for whatever belongs to each individual <lb/>
            citizen stands or falls with the state ; so that citizens thus <lb/>
            qualified preserve the property of other individuals as well as <lb/>
            their own. 12. But many of those who make such observa­ <lb/>
            tions would rather, from being rendered unreasonable through <lb/>
            envy, perish in their own indolence, than be preserved by the <lb/>
            honourable exertions of others ; for most pleasures have a <lb/>
            pernicious influence, and, being overcome by them, they are <lb/>
            incited to take the worse course, in their words and actions, <lb/>
            . instead of the better. is. Hence they bring on themselves, <lb/>
            from foolish words, enmities, and, from ill conduct, diseases <note type="footnote">1 The older and more experienced hunters. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Aid <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ἐν τη̨̃ ἀληθεία παιδεύεσϑαι</foreign>.] Not in umbraticâ disciplinâ, says <lb/>

            and punishments. as well as death to themselves and their <lb/>
            children and their friends, being insensible to the evil that <lb/>
            they were incurring, but having a keener inclination for plea­ <lb/>
            sures than other men ; and who can make indulgence in plea­ <lb/>
            sure turn to the benefit of his country ? 14. From these evils, <lb/>
            however, every one will be free, who loves what I recommend, <lb/>
            since good training teaches men to observe the laws, and to <lb/>
            speak as well as to hear, with a regard to what is just. 15. <lb/>
            Those who make it their study, accordingly, to be continually <lb/>
            labouring and learning something, choose toilsome pursuits <lb/>
            and cares for themselves, but secure safety for their own com­ <lb/>
            munities ; but those who decline to be taught anything, because <lb/>
            it is laborious, and prefer to spend their lives in impropei <lb/>
            pleasures, are characters of the very worst nature.</p>
          <p>16. They obey neither the laws nor good admonitions; for. <lb/>
            as they shrink from every effort at improvement, they gain <lb/>
            no conception what a man of virtue ought to be ; so that they <lb/>
            can neither be pious nor wise, but, consigning themselves to <lb/>
            ignorance, inveigh greatly against those who are learned. <lb/>
            17. By means of such men, therefore, nothing can be made to <lb/>
            prosper, as everything advantageous to mankind is found out <lb/>
            by better men than they ; and the better are those who are <lb/>
            willing to exert themselves. 18. This has been demonstrated <lb/>
            by strong proof ; for, among the ancients, those who studied <lb/>
            under Chiron, and whom I mentioned before, began their ex­ <lb/>
            ercises when they were young, with hunting, and became <lb/>
            masters of many noble qualifications, whence great honour <lb/>
            was paid to them for their virtue, for which they are even to <lb/>
            the present day held in admiration.</p>
          <p>That all men have a love for such virtue is evident, but, <lb/>
            because it is possible to attain it only by labour, the greater <lb/>
            part of mankind shrink from the pursuit of it; and the at­ <lb/>
            tainment of it is indeed uncertain, while the exertions attend­ <lb/>
            ant on the pursuit of it are manifest. 19. Perhaps, however, <lb/>
            if Virtue could be seen bodily, men would be less neglectful of <lb/>
            her; knowing that they would be seen by her as she would <lb/>
            be seen by them; 20. for every one, when he is in the sight of <lb/>
            the object of his love, conducts himself better than at other <lb/>
            times, and neither does nor says anything unbecoming or wrong, <lb/>
            lest it should be seen by that object. 21. But men, thinking <lb/>
            that they are not seen by Virtue, because they do not see her, <pb n="371"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="§ 1—5.]"/> <lb/>
            commit many wicked and dishonourable acts without disguise ;1 <lb/>
            yet she is in reality present everywhere, as she is immortal, <lb/>
            and honours those who act rightly towards her, and casts dis­ <lb/>
            honour on those who act wrong. Could they feel assured, <lb/>
            then, that she sees them, they would devote themselves to <lb/>
            those labours and studies by which she is, though with diffi­ <lb/>
            culty; captivated, and would secure her favour.</p>

          <p>A chapter on the vanity and empty professions of the sophists ; not written, <lb/>
            in all probability, by Xenophon.</p>
          <p>1. BUT I wonder at those men who are called sophists, be­ <lb/>
            cause the most of them say that they lead mankind to virtue, <lb/>
            while in reality they lead them in a contrary direction ; for <lb/>
            we have nowhere seen any man whom the present race of <lb/>
            sophists have rendered virtuous; nor do they offer any writ­ <lb/>
            ings to the world by which people may be made virtuous. <lb/>
            2. But concerning frivolous subjects many treatises have been <lb/>
            written by them, from which empty amusement for the young <lb/>
            may be derived, but in which there are no precepts of virtue ; <lb/>
            treatises which cause useless consumption of time to those <lb/>
            who vainly hope to learn something from them, detaining <lb/>
            them from other more profitable occupations, and even teach­ <lb/>
            ing them what is bad. 3. I blame them, then, for their more <lb/>
            grave offences2 more severely; but as to what they write, I <lb/>
            say that their words are studied with the utmost care, but <lb/>
            that moral principles, by which youth may be formed to vir­ <lb/>
            tue, are nowhere to be found in them. 4. I indeed am no <lb/>
            extraordinary person, but I know that while it is best to be <lb/>
            taught what is good by nature herself, it is next in desirable­ <lb/>
            ness to be instructed by those who really know something of <lb/>
            goodness rather than by such as understand merely the art of <lb/>
            deceiving. 5. My words, perhaps, I may not use with the <lb/>
            art of the sophists, for I make it not my object to do so; but <lb/>
            the instructions which those need who are rightly trained to <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἐναντίον</foreign>, palam, "openly." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Vices, offences against morality in their ares, appear to be meant. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 B 2 </note> <pb n="372"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[CH. 13."/> <lb/>
            virtue I try to express with proper understanding of them ; <lb/>
            for mere words cannot afford instruction,1 but thoughts may, <lb/>
            if they be of a right kind.</p>
          <p>6. Many others also blame the sophists of the present day <lb/>
            (I do not say the philosophers), for showing their acuteness <lb/>
            in words and not in thoughts. It does not escape my con­ <lb/>
            sideration that it would be well for what I write to be ar­ <lb/>
            ranged in proper order, for it will be easy for them to find <lb/>
            fault with what is written hastily as not being written ele­ <lb/>
            gantly; 7. it is written however in such a way that it may <lb/>
            express what is right, and may make men, not sophistical, <lb/>
            but wise and good; for I do not wish it merely to seem, but <lb/>
            to be good, that it may remain irrefutable for ever. 8. The <lb/>
            sophists, on the contrary, speak and write only to deceive, <lb/>
            and for their own gain, and profit nobody in any way ; for no <lb/>
            one of them has ever been, or is, wise ; but each of them is <lb/>
            content with being called a sophist, which is but a term of <lb/>
            reproach among the right-thinking part of mankind. 9. Against <lb/>
            the precepts of the sophists, therefore, I exhort the young to <lb/>
            be on their guard, but not to undervalue the instructions of <lb/>
            the philosophers ; for the sophists hunt for the rich and young ; <lb/>
            but the philosophers are the common teachers and common <lb/>
            friends of all. The fortunes of men they neither esteem nor <lb/>
            contemn.</p>
          <p>10. I exhort the young, also, not to emulate those who <lb/>
            hastily seek their own aggrandisement, whether in private or <lb/>
            in public affairs, reflecting that while the best of them are <lb/>
            known to their honour, and are industrious, the bad meet with <lb/>
            ill fortune, and are distinguished to their disgrace; 11. for, <lb/>
            robbing individuals of their property, and embezzling the <lb/>
            money of the public, they are less profitable to the common <lb/>
            welfare than persons in a private station, while they have <lb/>
            their bodies in the very worst and most disgraceful condition <lb/>
            for war, being utterly incapable of any exertion. But hunt­ <lb/>
            ers, on the contrary, present alike their bodies and their pro­ <lb/>
            perty in excellent condition for promoting the common good <lb/>
            of their countrymen. 12. Hunters attack beasts of prey ; the <lb/>
            other sort of people attack their friends. Those who act <lb/>
            against their friends incur infamy among all men; hunters, <lb/>
            from pursuing wild beasts, gain great honour; for, if they <note type="footnote">1 Xenophon would surely not have expressed himself thus. </note> <pb n="373"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="§ 13—18.]"/> <lb/>
            capture the beasts, they subdue enemies ; and, if they do not, <lb/>
            they nevertheless receive praise, not only because they assail <lb/>
            animals that meditate mischief to the whole community, but <lb/>
            because they proceed against them neither to the injury of <lb/>
            any man nor for their own private gain. 13. Besides, by the <lb/>
            exercise itself they are rendered better for many purposes, as <lb/>
            well as wiser, by the causes which I shall specify. If, in the <lb/>
            first place, they did not highly excel in activity, and contriv­ <lb/>
            ances, and vigilance, in various ways, they would gain no <lb/>
            booty; 14. for their adversaries, fighting for their lives, and <lb/>
            in their own retreats, are in full force; so that the toil of the <lb/>
            hunter would be in vain, if he did not subdue them with <lb/>
            greater perseverance and with much intelligence. is. Those <lb/>
            who wish, then, to gain a superior station in the state, medi­ <lb/>
            tate how to overcome their friends; the hunters, how to over­ <lb/>
            throw common enemies. The exercise of the hunters makes <lb/>
            them better men for other opponents ; the practice of the other <lb/>
            sort of people much worse men ; the prey of the one is gained <lb/>
            in conjunction with wisdom, that of the other with disgrace­ <lb/>
            ful audacity. 16. The one can despise mean practices and dis­ <lb/>
            honourable gains, the other cannot; the one utter a voice <lb/>
            expressive of good, the other, of turpitude; the one show <lb/>
            themselves pious in the highest degree, the other feel nothing <lb/>
            to restrain them from acting impiously towards all the di­ <lb/>
            vinities.</p>
          <p>17. Tales of old times are in circulation, which say that the <lb/>
            gods delight in the pursuit of hunting, both as actors and as <lb/>
            spectators; so that the young, reflecting on this, may be both <lb/>
            lovers of the gods and pious in their conduct, at least those <lb/>
            who observe the admonitions which I give, and think that <lb/>
            what they do is seen by some one of the deities; and they <lb/>
            will then be a benefit to their parents, their country in gener­ <lb/>
            al, and every one of their fellow-citizens and friends. 18. Not <lb/>
            only indeed have men who have been fond of the chace ob­ <lb/>
            tained an honourable character, but also women to whom the <lb/>
            goddess Diana has given excellence in the pursuit, as Ata­ <lb/>
            lan fa, Precis, and some others.</p>

          <p>I. HERMOGENES, happening to meet me, told me some <lb/>
            other things, and, as I asked him about you, what system of <lb/>
            philosophy you followed, he replied, the same as Socrates. 2. <lb/>
            But even when you were living at Athens, I admired your <lb/>
            judgment; and as I began to admire you then, so also now I <lb/>
            admire the unshaken firmness of your mind above any of <lb/>
            those that have embraced the pursuit of wisdom; for it is, as <lb/>
            I consider, the greatest proof of virtue, that you have been <lb/>
            attracted by that man, if indeed people thought2 the life of <lb/>
            Socrates that of a mortal man.</p>
          <p>3. That there are divine beings over us is manifest to <lb/>
            every one; and it is enough for us to worship them for the <lb/>
            superiority of their power; but of what nature they are, it is <lb/>
            neither easy to find, nor dutiful to inquire; for it does not be­ <lb/>
            long to slaves to understand the nature and conduct of their <lb/>
            masters, as their sole business is to serve; 4. and, what is <lb/>
            the most remarkable, the more admiration we must bestow <lb/>
            on those who labour for the interests of mankind, the more <lb/>
            blame is attached3 to those who aim at getting reputation <note type="footnote"> I Stobæus, Tit. 80. 12. It is also to be found in Eusebius, Præp. <lb/>

            from improper and worthless objects. 5. For when, my dear <lb/>
            Æschines, did any one ever hear Socrates discoursing about <lb/>
            the heavenly bodies,1 or exhorting men to learn geometry in <lb/>
            order to improve their morals ? As for music, we are aware <lb/>
            that he knew nothing more of it than the pleasure of hearing <lb/>
            it. But he was constantly discussing with his friends what <lb/>
            propriety was, or fortitude, or justice, or other virtues.2 6. <lb/>
            These he called the important concerns of mankind; other <lb/>
            things he said were impossible to be comprehended by man, <lb/>
            or were akin to fables, trifling amusements for the mind, such <lb/>
            as those on which the sophists so superciliously descant. <lb/>
            Nor did he only say this, without observing it in his conduct; <lb/>
            but to detail what he did to you who know it, though it <lb/>
            would not be unpleasing, would take up time; and I have <lb/>
            recorded it elsewhere.3</p>
          <p>7. Let those, therefore, whom Socrates did not satisfy, be <lb/>
            convinced and keep silence, or adopt just notions respecting <lb/>
            him; a man to whose wisdom the god at Delphi testified, <lb/>
            while those who put him to death could find no expiation by <lb/>
            repentance.4 8. But these illustrious philosophers5 are in <lb/>

            stancy to Socrates, as does also their love of tyranny, and <lb/>
            their preference of the immoderate luxury of a Sicilian <lb/>

            <title type="sub">FROM A LETTER TO CRITO,</title>
          </ab>
          <p>.... For be assured that Socrates often said to us, that those <lb/>
            who are anxious about their children that they may have <lb/>
            abundance of wealth, but have no care that they may become <lb/>
            honourable and upright, act like those who breed horses, but <lb/>
            train them to no military uses, though they supply them <lb/>
            with abundance of food ; 2. since they will thus have their <lb/>
            horses fatter, but unqualified for what they ought to be able <lb/>
            to do, as the merit of a horse consists, not in having abund­ <lb/>
            ance of flesh, but in being courageous and well-exercised for <lb/>
            the field of battle. The same fault, he said, was committed by <lb/>
            those who acquire a great quantity of land for their children, <lb/>
            but are regardless of their personal improvement; since what <lb/>
            they possess will be thought of great value, but themselves of <lb/>
            very little ; while, on the contrary, that which possesses ought <lb/>
            to be more valuable than that which is possessed. 3. Accord­ <lb/>
            ingly, he who renders his son deserving of high estimation <lb/>
            has, though he bequeaths him but little, bestowed upon him <lb/>
            much ; for it is from the condition of the mind 2 that our <lb/>
            possessions appear greater or less, since to a well-ordered mind <lb/>
            they seem sufficient, but to an ill-regulated and untaught <lb/>
            mind too little. 4. You give your children nothing more <lb/>
            than necessity requires : this, however, by the well-instructed, <lb/>
            is considered not only sufficient for their wants, but absolute <lb/>
            wealth ; but as for the ignorant, though it frees them from <lb/>
            bodily uneasiness,3 it does not at all diminish their despondent <lb/>
            views of the future.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>To me, Soteira, death appears nothing either repulsive or <lb/>
            attractive, but merely an end of life, though not indeed the <lb/>
            same for all, as inequality from birth, in regard to strength or <lb/>
            weakness, brings inequality in number of years ;5 and as <lb/>
            different causes, sometimes disgraceful, and sometimes honour­ <lb/>
            able and becoming, bring on death. <note type="footnote"> 1 Stob. Tit. 83. 29. </note><note type="footnote">a Comp.

            <title type="sub">FROM THE SAME LETTER.1</title>
          </ab>
          <p>But neither ought you to feel so much concern about death, <lb/>
            knowing that we must regard birth as the beginning of man's <lb/>
            course, and death as the end. He2 has died, as he who was <lb/>
            even ever so reluctant would have died; but to die honourably <lb/>
            is the part of one who is willing, to die, and who has been <lb/>
            taught what he ought to know. Happy therefore is Gryllus, <lb/>
            and whoever chooses, not the greatest prolongation of life, <lb/>
            but life distinguished by virtue ; though the gods granted <lb/>
            him, indeed, but a short life.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">FROM A LETTER TO LAMPROCLES, OR LAMPROCLEIA.3</title>
          </ab>
          <p>... For you must first of all approve the excellent precept of <lb/>
            Socrates, that "we must measure wealth ;"4 for Socrates used <lb/>
            to say, that vast property was not wealth, but so much as is <lb/>
            becoming for us to use ; and he admonished us besides not <lb/>
            to err in our judgment about such matters, as those who <lb/>
            use what they possess becomingly are justly to be called rich ; <lb/>
            but others he pronounced poor, and declared that they were <lb/>
            afflicted with poverty of an incurable kind, as it was want of <lb/>
            understanding, and not of pecuniary means. * * * No evil <lb/>
            indeed originates with a man who makes prudence and <lb/>
            temperance the foundations of wisdom.</p>
          <p>There are five Letters attributed to Xenophon in the Socratis et Socra­ <lb/>
            ticorum Epistolae, published by Leo Allatius, and placed by Weiske at <lb/>
